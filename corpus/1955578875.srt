1
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:52,460
<i> I have to go.</i>

2
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:11,879
Here.

3
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,021
Can I see you again?

4
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,391
One war ministry telegram
is enough.

5
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,960
Brandt.

6
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:01,529
<i> What do you know
 about the kaiser?</i>

7
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,603
<i> Kaiser Wilhelm ii, former
 emperor of the fatherland.</i>

8
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:11,472
<i> Weak leader. Poor strategist.</i>

9
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:13,207
<i> Led us to defeat.
 Ran away afterwards.</i>

10
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,543
- Exiled in Belgium, sir.
- Holland.

11
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:18,913
- Is he still alive?
- Damn your ignorance, captain.

12
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,548
The kaiser is still alive

13
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,984
and remains
of great symbolic importance.

14
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,393
You'll take immediate command of
kaiser Wilhelm's military guard

15
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:33,628
outside utrecht.

16
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,763
As of now,
the safety of the kaiser

17
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,765
is of prime concern
to the reich,

18
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,568
and, therefore, also to you.

19
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,938
General, I am now fit
for active service.

20
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,941
Don't push your luck, captain.

21
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:50,745
After that business
with the ss in Poland,

22
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:53,014
you were lucky to avoid
a court martial.

23
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,216
This posting is a great honor.

24
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:56,451
Yes, general.

25
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,453
Thank you, general.

26
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,456
General,
if the kaiser's in Holland,

27
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,857
how am I to guard him?

28
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:07,962
At dawn, our forces invaded
Belgium and the Netherlands.

29
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,200
The fuhrer thinks of everything.

30
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:51,866
Brandt. Eighth infantry.

31
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:54,902
I am
colonel sigurd Von ilsemann,

32
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:56,804
aide-de-camp to the kaiser.

33
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,006
My orders are to assume
immediate command

34
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,741
of the kaiser's bodyguard.

35
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,643
A captain?

36
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:06,013
All the majors are busy, sir.

37
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,885
The Dutch army guard
have deserted.

38
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,720
Your men can billet
in the stables.

39
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,856
- I'll need a command post.
- I'm in charge.

40
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,023
Within the grounds.

41
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:19,760
The female staff
are not to be interfered with.

42
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:22,196
Look forward
to working with you.

43
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,232
Wilhelm!

44
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:27,702
Wilhelm!

45
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,004
They're here.

46
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:34,275
- The army, your army.
- No. No. Not mine.

47
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,244
They have been sent
to protect you.

48
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:39,313
That in itself
is not without significance.

49
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,684
In return, it is vital to make
the right impression.

50
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:44,952
Oh, on whom?

51
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:47,855
Our friends in Berlin

52
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:50,324
have been constantly active
on your behalf.

53
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,261
The army want you back.
They always have.

54
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:59,100
The stage is set.
Every detail matters.

55
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:02,904
We must invite
the commanding officer
to dinner.

56
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,640
So now we're running
a restaurant?

57
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:09,143
- He will be watching us.
- Yes, perhaps. From outside.

58
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:14,115
Wilhelm, do you want
your throne back or not?

59
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:16,751
You are the kaiser.

60
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,824
Secure the perimeter.
Get this place cleaned up.

61
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:26,794
- We have to go faster.
- Move it!

62
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:39,807
I'm looking for
gestapo inspector Dietrich.

63
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,351
Inspector Dietrich, I'm Brandt.

64
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,219
I expected you yesterday.

65
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,790
Apologies. My orders
were to report upon arrival.

66
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:56,924
No time was specified.

67
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,695
What can I do for you,
inspector?

68
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:04,332
The kaiser.
The former kaiser.

69
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,834
The gestapo
keeps extensive files
on this individual,

70
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,402
but they are not up to date.

71
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,971
As part of your duties here,

72
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,872
you will compile
a detailed report.

73
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:12,840
In particular,

74
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,943
his attitudes towards the reich
and its leaders,

75
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,279
anything he says
about the war and its conduct,

76
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,948
noting also
significant omissions,

77
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,117
such as failure to agree
with statements

78
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,952
in favor of the reich.

79
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,220
You expect me to spy on him?

80
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,190
You'll also list his visitors,

81
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,993
noting the duration
of their stay.

82
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:34,295
- Is that really necessary?
- Ah.

83
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,264
You think because he is old,
he is unimportant?

84
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,102
The British secret service
have an agent in the area.

85
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:45,806
We picked up coded radio
transmissions from the vicinity.

86
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:48,409
It could be a kidnap attempt
or an assassination.

87
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,379
Assassinate an old man
ousted 20 years ago?

88
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,382
Personally,
i couldn't care less.

89
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:59,220
He is everything that was wrong
with old Germany.

90
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:04,392
Where was he
while we were all starving?

91
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,896
If anything happens to him,
captain, you'll be shot.

92
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:10,931
And I will do it.

93
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,877
<i> Did you read
 the ss file on him?</i>

94
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:25,913
Hard to believe
he wasn't executed.

95
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:29,316
He must have friends in Berlin.

96
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:34,522
Brussels fell
to our forces yesterday

97
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:37,425
and airborne troops have secured
the French border.

98
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:40,361
Holland is now
almost completely occupied,

99
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:44,265
- barring unofficial resistance.
- It's unnecessary.

100
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:47,134
Strategically irrelevant
and a waste of resources.

101
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:48,536
I mean, invading Holland!

102
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,371
Further south,
armored divisions

103
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,239
are through
the ardennes forest,

104
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:54,308
in behind the maginot line.

105
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:01,015
Forgive me, your highness.

106
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,551
I was told
you have coffee at this time.

107
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,358
You're new.

108
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:14,895
- Yes, your highness.
- No need to be alarmed.

109
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,464
What's your name?

110
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,401
- Mieke, your highness.
- Dutch?

111
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,536
- Yes, your highness.
- I see.

112
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:27,141
Well, tell me, child,
would you have invaded Holland?

113
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,309
What?

114
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,444
If you commanded
the German army,

115
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,379
would you have invaded Holland?

116
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,015
Why, yes, your highness.
Of course.

117
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:39,587
I see. And what precisely
is your military objective?

118
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:42,089
- Well, it's very nice.
- What is?

119
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:43,991
Holland.

120
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:55,035
Goddamn, sigurd. She's better
than half the general staff!

121
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:58,405
We will expect you
at tomorrow's briefing!

122
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,174
Yes, your highness.

123
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:07,148
She's the one my wife has been
complaining about, I suppose.

124
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,617
You know,
i don't mind telling you,

125
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:13,120
if I was
a hundred years younger...

126
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:15,689
Oh, never mind.

127
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:27,201
You know, sigurd,
I've been thinking.

128
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,472
Tonight we'll have fish.

129
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,364
The kaiser presents
his compliments.

130
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,967
He'd be pleased
if you'd join him

131
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,201
at dinner tomorrow night.

132
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:51,151
Take your clothes off.

133
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:55,389
Please.

134
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,729
Gently.

135
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:45,666
Please...

136
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:51,305
Tell the kaiser
i would be honored

137
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,173
to accept his invitation.

138
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:51,365
There.

139
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,504
Fuck it.

140
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,440
Your highness.

141
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,249
May I take that, captain?

142
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,752
Thank you.

143
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:21,395
- You stink of schnapps.
- We must speak.

144
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,897
Not now. You're late.
He's waiting.

145
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,200
You'll call him sir
and his wife madam.

146
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,936
The treaty of versailles forbids
any other form of address.

147
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,904
His left arm
is slightly deformed.

148
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,339
You will not look at it.

149
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:34,508
You will speak only
when spoken to

150
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,843
and avoid politics.

151
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:39,847
Express no opinion of your own,
agree with his, and remember...

152
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,515
At the age of four,

153
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,917
he bit the Duke of Edinburgh
in the leg.

154
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,726
Captain Brandt.

155
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:56,196
Prince friedrich Wilhelm Viktor
Albrecht Von preussen

156
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:57,197
and his wife,

157
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,700
Princess hermine reuss
Von greiz.

158
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,403
Your highness. Your highness.

159
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,877
We are both so pleased
you could join us, captain.

160
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:13,714
<i> ..That I have always found
 so fascinating.</i>

161
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:16,984
<i> I published a book
 on the subject in 1934.</i>

162
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:19,753
<i> You will have seen it.</i>

163
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:23,824
For example, there are
some people who actually believe

164
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,927
that Adolf Hitler invented
the swastika.

165
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:30,531
Utter nonsense. The word
comes from the sanskrit.

166
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:34,501
It means well-being,
and the earliest examples

167
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,937
date from the indus valley,

168
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,373
3,000 years before Christ.

169
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,442
Oh, yes.
In many religions, it's...

170
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:46,313
It is a symbol of life,
of good fortune.

171
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,616
Not that it has brought much
to me.

172
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:57,324
And yet we must accept
that god has imposed

173
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,792
these terrible trials on us

174
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:02,596
for some inscrutable purpose
of his own.

175
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:06,934
Oh, these books they're writing,

176
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,936
my god!

177
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:12,573
They just dump bucketloads
of filth on my head

178
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:14,808
and nobody does anything.

179
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:19,880
Bismarck would have had
something to say on the subject.

180
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,516
But he had something
to say on every subject,

181
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,117
which is why I got rid of him.

182
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:30,591
His servants would pull
the wine corks in front of you.

183
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,028
But I must say the old boy knew
how to deal with troublemakers.

184
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:39,299
Freemasons, bolsheviks, Jews.

185
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,401
The unholy alliance
that we have to face.

186
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,539
Which is exactly why

187
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,674
a strong monarchy,

188
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:51,578
the physical manifestation
of god's will on earth,

189
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,514
is more vital now than ever.

190
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:01,555
Tell us about yourself, captain.
Where's your family from?

191
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,058
Brandenburg, your highness.

192
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,761
My grandfather was
an army officer,

193
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,530
as was my father.

194
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:14,034
He was killed on the somme
just before I was born.

195
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:18,772
- And your mother?
- From a landowning family.

196
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:22,109
- Really? Which one?
- Related to the ludendorffs.

197
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:24,011
- Oh.
- Distantly.

198
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:27,814
After the war, of course,
she had to clean houses.

199
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,952
I remember
helping her wheel

200
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:33,720
her wages home in a barrow.

201
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:37,924
By the time we got to the bakery
it was worthless.

202
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,560
She died of tuberculosis
when I was 12.

203
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:46,633
Am I to blame

204
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:50,203
for every misfortune
on this earth?

205
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:54,207
I gave my life
to the fatherland!

206
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,743
And this is my thanks?

207
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:01,081
Nobody cares
my Navy betrayed me!

208
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,984
Nobody remembers
my army fell apart.

209
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:05,986
Ludendorff, bethmann,
tirpitz!

210
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,188
Where were they?
Where were they?

211
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:11,925
After all I've done for them,

212
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:14,761
they stabbed me in the back.

213
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,232
They lost me the war!

214
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:28,975
They lost me my country.

215
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,206
I ask forgiveness

216
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,775
for unintentionally upsetting
his highness.

217
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,512
His earlier remark
about the fuhrer

218
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,582
was simply a correction of fact,
in no way a criticism.

219
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:20,660
The trout was first rate.

220
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:23,263
Hmm.

221
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:05,739
How did you get in?

222
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:12,646
Take your clothes off.

223
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:59,853
Will there be anything else,
your highness?

224
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,122
No, thank you, sigurd.

225
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,891
There will be
absolutely nothing.

226
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,717
Wait.

227
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:37,257
Stay. Stay the night.

228
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:19,099
- Good morning, your highness.
- Huh!

229
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,203
I had a visit just now
from captain Brandt.

230
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:27,173
He tells me the British have
an agent active in this area.

231
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:30,343
It is his opinion that
this agent may wish you harm.

232
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:32,846
An agent?

233
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:35,015
We must alert the ducks.

234
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,983
He therefore requests

235
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:39,119
that he move
into the house immediately.

236
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:47,494
What do you think of him,
our captain Brandt?

237
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:51,798
He is a typical, cocky,
young officer,

238
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,267
sure he can win
the war on his own.

239
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,438
Does he remind you of anyone,
sigurd?

240
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:06,112
Are you ready for your daily
briefing, your highness?

241
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:10,383
I think I will give it a miss.

242
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,958
I have something
much more important to do.

243
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:35,275
He is not himself.

244
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:38,411
But I expect great news
any day now.

245
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:40,313
We must never lose hope.

246
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:43,249
It is the hope
which is killing him.

247
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:46,252
Of course,
i shall say nothing for now.

248
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:49,956
Until then, we must just keep
his spirits up.

249
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:07,173
- Oh.
- Forgive me, your highness.

250
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:10,176
Colonel Von ilsemann sent me out
with more bread.

251
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:12,879
Oh, did he now?
That was very good of him. Ha!

252
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,248
- For the ducks.
- Oh, for the ducks, of course.

253
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,916
It's a bit early for my lunch.

254
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:20,186
No, why don't you feed them?

255
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:29,896
You have beautiful hands.

256
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:34,934
You are quite unused
to physical labour, no?

257
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:37,904
War changes everything.

258
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:41,474
<i> Ja.</i>

259
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,912
What do you think of ducks,
child?

260
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,047
Hmm? I'm very fond of them.

261
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:51,351
They're beautiful creatures,
and they ask for so little.

262
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:54,254
A duck will never blame you
for his troubles

263
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,590
or force you
to abdicate your throne.

264
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:04,464
I know you miss it terribly,
and yet, what a dreadful burden.

265
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,499
You're right.

266
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:09,035
And it was.

267
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:11,304
Captain. Captain!

268
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:14,274
Your highness.

269
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:20,013
I hear there's a British spy
after me.

270
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:21,681
You'll be quite safe,
your highness.

271
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:26,619
Sigurd tells me that you fought
in Poland last year.

272
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:32,325
My grandson, Oscar, was killed
at the front there.

273
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,560
Perhaps you knew?

274
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,229
No. No, your highness.
I... I didn't.

275
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:38,298
Please accept my sympathies.

276
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,303
Last September. Hmm.
You must come to dinner again.

277
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,606
Tell me all about it. Er...

278
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,176
Why don't you, er,

279
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:53,980
show the captain
his new rooms at the house?

280
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:57,183
Of course, your highness.

281
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:24,010
My name is Stefan.
I was wondering what yours was.

282
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:29,716
De jong. Mieke de jong.

283
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,185
May I call you mieke?

284
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,754
It would be better
if you didn't.

285
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,025
Copulation is strictly forbidden
among the staff.

286
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:40,660
I would lose my position.

287
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,195
You might lose yours.

288
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,198
Where's your room?

289
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,701
On the other side
of the staircase.

290
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,169
The last on the right.

291
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:00,313
They told me you were up here.

292
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:04,284
Nice place. Very comfy.

293
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:06,219
What can I do for you,
inspector?

294
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,521
There was another transmission
last night.

295
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,623
We only have
the one detector truck,

296
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,660
but there's a chance
it's coming from the village.

297
00:30:13,662 --> 00:30:15,561
We're getting
a second truck soon,

298
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,064
and then we'll find
the exact location.

299
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,668
- Soon?
- How's your report coming?

300
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:27,407
Fuck. I wouldn't mind
pulling her in for questioning.

301
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,510
You know,
they say the Dutch women

302
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:33,079
are as sex-mad as the French.

303
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,515
I'm sure your reich marks
will be welcome anywhere.

304
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:37,216
- What?
- In the meantime,

305
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,286
you might spend less time
lusting after servant girls

306
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:42,555
and more finding
a second detector truck.

307
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,794
Ah! You've marked her out
for yourself, have you?

308
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:50,663
Copulation is strictly forbidden
among the staff.

309
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:53,166
Goodbye, inspector.

310
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:30,436
Anyone might think
you were spying on me, captain.

311
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:34,307
Forgive me, your highness.

312
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:38,845
What are you doing
creeping around in the woods?

313
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:41,514
If anything happens to you,
I'll be shot.

314
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,217
Oh, it's good to know
they still care.

315
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:47,420
Walk with me.

316
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,626
Tell me about Poland.
Your first action?

317
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:55,762
Yes, your highness.

318
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:58,164
What you expected?

319
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,166
I expected to die.

320
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:16,449
They know a British agent's
here.

321
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:17,417
Who knows?

322
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:18,885
The captain guarding the kaiser.

323
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:21,487
And the gestapo turned up
at the house today.

324
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:25,324
If they knew any more than that,
you'd have been arrested by now.

325
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:35,768
- When can you do it?
- I need more time.

326
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,904
- You may not have it.
- I know that.

327
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:43,843
As soon as you feel it's safe,

328
00:32:44,478 --> 00:32:45,578
do it.

329
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:48,314
Then we'll get you out.

330
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:56,856
Be careful.

331
00:34:03,757 --> 00:34:04,957
What are you doing?

332
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:06,759
I wanted to see you.

333
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:10,630
I'm on duty now.
They're calling me.

334
00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:17,303
There's a gestapo officer,
Dietrich, in utrecht.

335
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:20,706
What about him?

336
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,876
If he bothers you at all,
tell me.

337
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:25,578
I'll deal with it.

338
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:37,957
It seems the general staff
has learnt

339
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,926
from its mistakes of last time.

340
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:41,594
Wouldn't you say, huh, child?

341
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:45,264
On the whole, your highness.

342
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:49,402
Although, they may find
the infernal machinery,

343
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:53,573
<i> la machine infernale,
harder to stop than to start.</i>

344
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:56,776
I never wanted the last war,
you know.

345
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:00,680
But there are still people
who don't...

346
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,515
Who don't seem to realize that.

347
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:06,886
Of course,
the serbs were a crowd of thugs.

348
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,854
They still are.

349
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,958
But I told the Austrians,

350
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:16,596
"you got what you wanted.
Stop in Belgrade!"

351
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:21,100
I wrote a telegram to Vienna,
"stop in Belgrade!"

352
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,403
They never sent it.

353
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:29,508
Bethmann, moltke,
they wanted the war, you see.

354
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:32,945
It was never sent.
They made sure of that.

355
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,780
Yes, your highness.

356
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,083
My voice...
My voice was a lone voice.

357
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:38,084
Perhaps...

358
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:39,952
What could I do?
What could I do?

359
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:42,388
..The captain would
like to see your collection

360
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,856
of military uniforms?

361
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:46,726
Yes, yes, go on.

362
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:08,047
He was still the kaiser.

363
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:11,050
He could have sent
another fucking telegram.

364
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:16,555
Any progress catching the spy?

365
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:18,758
They're waiting
for another signal truck.

366
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:54,994
Your family.

367
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:00,733
- My family, your highness?
- Are they all right?

368
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:04,503
If there's anything I can do
for them, you must let me know.

369
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:09,175
- These are difficult times.
- Thank you, your highness.

370
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:11,577
Your highness...

371
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,712
What is it?

372
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:16,649
You're very kind, your highness.
Good night.

373
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,521
Was that girl asking for money?

374
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:25,991
I believe I was enquiring
about her family.

375
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:28,861
Perhaps I dreamed it.

376
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:30,930
Well, I don't like her manner.

377
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:34,633
If it weren't for the shortage,
i would certainly let her go.

378
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,246
I suppose your duty is
to read this stuff?

379
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:50,883
- You're ignorant.
- I know.

380
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:02,595
Mieke, I wanted to apologize

381
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:05,865
for how I was the first time
we met.

382
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,633
Met?

383
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:10,302
You know what I mean.

384
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:28,587
I wanted you.

385
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:02,087
It's somewhere in the village.

386
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,089
We'll get him next time.

387
00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:14,600
So, how did you get
your iron cross second class?

388
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:21,240
I survived
in a second class way.

389
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:24,610
And the scars?

390
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:27,279
Shrapnel.

391
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:32,117
Most of it's still in there.

392
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,919
It hurts you.

393
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:38,924
Is that why you're stuck here
and not at the front?

394
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:43,629
I'm here
because I follow orders.

395
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:46,232
Do you always follow orders?

396
00:39:47,734 --> 00:39:48,901
What else is there?

397
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:56,342
I'm Jewish.

398
00:40:11,324 --> 00:40:12,658
I'm not.

399
00:40:15,862 --> 00:40:16,929
Obviously.

400
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,117
I don't care.

401
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:40,953
One day, you might have to.

402
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:45,124
One day, we'll be dead.

403
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:23,762
You have bad dreams.

404
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:33,405
You have someone, somewhere?

405
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:38,477
If I did, you wouldn't be here.

406
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:43,148
And you, captain?

407
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,450
No girl anywhere?

408
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,189
If I did, I'd still be here.

409
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,795
You have to go.

410
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:09,008
What you told me
about yourself...

411
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:13,445
Don't tell anyone else.

412
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:09,001
You're up early, inspector.

413
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,837
The transmitter's right
in the village.

414
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,907
If he doesn't signal tonight,
we'll go in and search.

415
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:16,542
Hmm.

416
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:20,512
But that's not why I'm here.

417
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,785
The old man is getting
a visit tomorrow,

418
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:28,353
from the head of the ss.

419
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:32,324
- Himmler's coming here?
- You catch on quick.

420
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:35,227
He'll have dinner,
then we'll take him back

421
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,062
to a secret location.

422
00:43:37,464 --> 00:43:39,565
- I'll notify the household.
- No, you won't.

423
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:42,000
You can tell the old man,
but no one else.

424
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:44,570
I'm handling his security,
so we'll search the house.

425
00:43:44,572 --> 00:43:46,572
I'll need a list
of all the staff.

426
00:43:46,574 --> 00:43:48,907
What do I tell them?
They'll ask questions.

427
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:52,544
Oh, their job is to answer them.
I'll be back in an hour.

428
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:08,227
Captain Brandt requests
a private audience.

429
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,294
Hmm.

430
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,138
Your highness,
what I have to tell you

431
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,839
is top secret and must remain
strictly between us...

432
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,374
Wilhelm! Oh, captain.

433
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:24,510
Have you heard the news?

434
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:26,912
Reichsfuhrer of the ss,
Heinrich himmler,

435
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,081
is coming to dinner
tomorrow night.

436
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,884
Isn't that marvelous?
I just received this telegram
from Berlin.

437
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,952
One can only hope
he has better manners

438
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:35,354
than that oaf, goering.

439
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:39,124
It is a pity that his wife

440
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:41,193
is not able to join him,
but still...

441
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:43,295
Oh, we have
a million things to do!

442
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:46,064
He came here a few years back,
fat goering.

443
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:49,635
You never knew
if he was a boy or a girl.

444
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:52,871
And he came down to lunch
in plus fours.

445
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:54,406
Plus fours!

446
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,609
My old regiment would have set
the dogs on him.

447
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,514
My husband is always joking.

448
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,951
You must have a great deal
to do today, captain,

449
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,554
so we mustn't keep you
a moment longer.

450
00:45:14,394 --> 00:45:16,161
Better start counting
the silver.

451
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:17,362
Wilhelm!

452
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:18,730
I regret to inform you

453
00:45:18,998 --> 00:45:21,200
the gestapo will search
the house

454
00:45:21,202 --> 00:45:23,035
before the reichsfuhrer's visit.

455
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:25,671
And may I say, between us,

456
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:30,676
it would be better if the kaiser
didn't air certain opinions

457
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:33,045
in front of the gestapo.

458
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:36,048
Inspector Dietrich
has no sense of humor.

459
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,753
Oh, colonel?

460
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:46,525
Do you keep guns in the house?

461
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,328
Of course. His highness shoots.

462
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,631
- And who cleans them?
- The guns? The footmen.

463
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:55,033
Hmm. Not the maids?

464
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:57,402
No, of course not the maids.
Why?

465
00:45:57,404 --> 00:45:58,737
Thank you.

466
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:03,108
At ease.

467
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,476
Ready?

468
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:11,016
- Captain.
- Your highness.

469
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:14,453
You must pay no attention
to my husband's jokes.

470
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:17,489
You know, there is nobody
more loyal to the fuhrer.

471
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:19,057
Please.

472
00:46:20,526 --> 00:46:24,529
Now, this visit tomorrow
is of the utmost significance.

473
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,466
It is, of course, well-known,
among those who know,

474
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:29,534
that himmler is
Hitler's right-hand man.

475
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,304
One hears that goering
isn't quite so trusted

476
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:34,239
- although,
it is due to my efforts

477
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:36,341
in that direction,
i shall say no more -

478
00:46:36,709 --> 00:46:39,344
that the government continues
to pay our allowance,

479
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:42,347
which Wilhelm doesn't seem
to understand,

480
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:44,616
could be taken away
at any moment.

481
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:46,084
But, before the last war,

482
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:47,986
he was the richest man
in Germany,

483
00:46:47,988 --> 00:46:51,156
so I'm afraid he has
very little idea of money.

484
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:56,094
The purpose of this visit

485
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:59,665
can only be to propose
in some form

486
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,767
the restoration of the monarchy.

487
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:06,738
Oh, the fuhrer has done
very well so far, of course.

488
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,574
But it is obvious that,
in this time of crisis,

489
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,643
Germany needs its king.

490
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,646
A man of wisdom and experience,

491
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:16,782
who can ensure
the allegiance of the church,

492
00:47:16,784 --> 00:47:19,584
the aristocracy,
and the armed forces.

493
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:22,354
I myself have been using

494
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:24,423
what little influence
i have in Berlin.

495
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,491
Oh, I shall say no more.

496
00:47:26,493 --> 00:47:30,162
But I am delighted that
my efforts have borne fruit.

497
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,732
It was for Germany that I acted,
of course.

498
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:36,735
Not for the pleasure
of seeing my sisters

499
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:38,637
bowing and scraping
in front of me.

500
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:39,471
Hmm.

501
00:47:39,473 --> 00:47:41,073
Do you know,
i am not sure

502
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:42,641
I shall even receive them
in court.

503
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:45,510
They treated me very shabbily
when I was young.

504
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:49,715
Captain,

505
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,685
as head of the kaiser's
personal bodyguard,

506
00:47:53,687 --> 00:47:56,254
herr himmler will surely want
your impressions.

507
00:47:57,557 --> 00:47:59,591
May I hope
you will give a positive account

508
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:02,694
of our humble and loyal
household?

509
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:04,730
- Of course, your highness.
- Thank you.

510
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:07,666
- I knew I could rely on you.
- If you'll excuse me.

511
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,241
<i>- Yes.
- Everyone knows.</i>

512
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:19,211
- Hmm?
- Kaiser's wife got a telegram.

513
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:21,246
I'll find out who sent it.

514
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:23,482
May I suggest my men start
at the top, work down?

515
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,117
You come up from the bottom.

516
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,619
Yes, that's just
what I was going to suggest.

517
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:31,823
It's a madhouse.

518
00:48:32,091 --> 00:48:33,592
It's a damned madhouse!

519
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:36,928
Who do they think they are?
Who do they think I am?

520
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:41,333
You should never
have permitted it!

521
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,801
Send me the damned girl!

522
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:53,211
Take a room each.

523
00:48:56,682 --> 00:48:59,117
Be respectful
of personal property,

524
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,385
but thorough.

525
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:02,587
I'll start at the far end.

526
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,710
You know, my uncle friedrich
once told me

527
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:30,415
that a one-armed man
should never be king in prussia.

528
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:35,454
I'll show you, I thought,
you miserable swine.

529
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:42,360
The old bastard died just
before I came to the throne.

530
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:45,697
I always thought

531
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:47,232
he did it on purpose.

532
00:49:51,704 --> 00:49:53,405
By the way, are you courting?

533
00:49:53,906 --> 00:49:54,973
Courting?

534
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:58,443
No. Well, not exactly,
your highness.

535
00:49:58,445 --> 00:49:59,978
I mean, there is someone.

536
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,614
Oh, of course there is.

537
00:50:03,616 --> 00:50:05,550
Do you love him?

538
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:07,686
No, I... I hardly know him.

539
00:50:11,357 --> 00:50:14,793
You know, my... the first girl
i ever loved, her name was Ella.

540
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:17,929
We had the same grandmother,
queen Victoria of england,

541
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,965
on her mother's side
and on mine.

542
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:22,467
But Ella...

543
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:27,706
Oh, she was gorgeous.

544
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:32,210
Of course, she knew it.

545
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:35,647
I went down on my knees
one summer evening

546
00:50:35,649 --> 00:50:38,250
and begged her to be my wife.

547
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:41,353
Instead, she married a romanov.

548
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:44,689
Butchered by bolsheviks
in a mine shaft.

549
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:48,760
That'll teach her, I thought.

550
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:54,766
So,

551
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:56,935
the moral of this story is...

552
00:50:58,704 --> 00:51:00,605
Be careful what you wish for.

553
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:05,744
And, as they say, seize the day.

554
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:11,349
Yes, definitely do that.

555
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:23,762
Finished?

556
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,664
For now.

557
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,366
- You look happy.
- Of course.

558
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:29,935
Here am I,

559
00:51:29,937 --> 00:51:32,938
a butcher's son from Munich,

560
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,074
tearing the kaiser's palace
upside down.

561
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:40,912
That is what national socialism
has done for Germany.

562
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,093
Staff files from Von ilsemann.

563
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:01,866
- What do you think of him?
- He's harmless.

564
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,469
- I don't like him.
- You don't like anyone.

565
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:09,007
We'll be back...

566
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:10,108
Tomorrow.

567
00:52:37,603 --> 00:52:39,504
Get it refueled.

568
00:52:54,854 --> 00:52:56,888
Himmler's coming
to the house tomorrow.

569
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,458
Himmler? The head of the ss?

570
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,962
He'll arrive in the afternoon,
and he'll stay for dinner.

571
00:53:03,964 --> 00:53:07,065
- I can kill him.
- No, that's not our mission.

572
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:10,502
Well, tell London.
They might change it.

573
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:11,970
No, it would be suicide!

574
00:53:15,608 --> 00:53:18,743
The ss murdered my father
and my husband.

575
00:53:18,745 --> 00:53:20,578
You're not here
for your family.

576
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,514
Tell London.
Tell them I'm ready.

577
00:53:22,516 --> 00:53:24,149
Tell them I'll do it.

578
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:27,552
Oh, my god.

579
00:53:28,654 --> 00:53:29,688
Oh, mieke.

580
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:37,862
I'll come to the house.

581
00:53:38,764 --> 00:53:41,833
And I'll give you the answer
tomorrow.

582
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,525
Let's go!

583
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:44,756
Sorry.

584
00:55:45,758 --> 00:55:47,792
I can go, if you want.

585
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:52,330
No.

586
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:04,008
Stay.

587
00:56:19,058 --> 00:56:20,825
Shh.

588
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,408
What is it this time?

589
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:41,813
<i> Poland.</i>

590
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:47,352
<i> A village
 of women and children.</i>

591
00:56:50,689 --> 00:56:53,358
<i> They'd been machine-gunned
 by the ss.</i>

592
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,964
<i> It was a beautiful day.</i>

593
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,403
And I thought...

594
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:08,706
God made this.

595
00:57:09,642 --> 00:57:12,176
God made all of it.

596
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:32,330
<i> There was a girl.</i>

597
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:34,165
<i> She was still alive.</i>

598
00:57:35,668 --> 00:57:38,002
<i> I tried to help her,
 but she died.</i>

599
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:46,010
I beat the officer senseless
in front of his unit.

600
00:57:47,146 --> 00:57:52,216
It's men like that they shame
the ss. They shame us all.

601
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:55,920
But they are not the exception,
they are the rule.

602
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:58,923
I don't believe that.

603
00:58:01,827 --> 00:58:03,328
I have to go.

604
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,205
- Will you marry me?
- What?

605
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:17,775
Marry me, mieke. Now. Today.

606
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:22,046
- Are you serious?
- Completely.

607
00:58:22,048 --> 00:58:23,514
But I'm a jewess.

608
00:58:24,116 --> 00:58:25,783
- I'll protect you.
- No!

609
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:28,152
Nobody can.

610
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:32,123
I will do my duty.

611
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,424
Everyone must.

612
00:58:52,444 --> 00:58:54,946
You never stop.
You're always there.

613
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:57,081
Ah.

614
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:11,896
Why is he coming, sigurd? Why?

615
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:15,466
Not to see my uniforms.

616
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:23,007
Is it possible?

617
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,211
After all this time?

618
00:59:32,251 --> 00:59:35,920
I dare not hope. I cannot.

619
00:59:36,455 --> 00:59:39,957
Certainly it would make
the empress exceedingly happy.

620
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:41,125
A small price to pay.

621
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:47,265
Sigurd, I have to be
at this morning's briefings.

622
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:49,534
I must be up to date
for our visitors.

623
00:59:49,536 --> 00:59:51,269
- Your highness.
- What?

624
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,142
I am sorry to involve you
in this sordid affair.

625
00:59:58,144 --> 00:59:59,811
This disgrace also involves

626
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:01,446
the head
of your personal bodyguard,

627
01:00:01,448 --> 01:00:03,147
whom you'll wish
to dismiss yourself.

628
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:05,516
What is the nature
of this scandal?

629
01:00:05,784 --> 01:00:08,386
This girl has been caught
in flagrant

630
01:00:08,388 --> 01:00:10,121
in this officer's bedroom.

631
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:13,224
Frau linnenkamp swears
it is not the first time.

632
01:00:13,226 --> 01:00:15,526
Your highness,
i am entirely to blame.

633
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,795
This comes to light
on the very day

634
01:00:17,797 --> 01:00:19,163
herr himmler is to visit!

635
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:21,199
God forbid
that he should hear of it.

636
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,934
You are dismissed.

637
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:24,836
Go and pack
your effects immediately.

638
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:26,871
Now, just a moment.

639
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:30,875
Nobody's going anywhere.

640
01:00:31,577 --> 01:00:36,214
I'll speak to the captain
and the girl.

641
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,585
In private.

642
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:42,220
I'm not sure you understand.

643
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:45,089
They have been caught
fornicating under our roof.

644
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:47,458
This girl is no better
than a common slut.

645
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,128
This officer has disgraced
his uniform.

646
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,395
Your uniform.

647
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,065
I may not rule in Germany,

648
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,634
but, by Christ,
i rule in my own house!

649
01:01:31,904 --> 01:01:35,239
This is him, I hope?

650
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:39,143
- Of course, your highness.
- Well!

651
01:01:39,945 --> 01:01:41,379
I am ashamed to say

652
01:01:41,381 --> 01:01:44,482
that before and after
my first marriage

653
01:01:44,484 --> 01:01:48,886
I myself fathered at least
two illegitimate children.

654
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:51,255
One with an Austrian countess,

655
01:01:51,257 --> 01:01:53,391
another
with a French prostitute,

656
01:01:53,393 --> 01:01:57,662
who was known in court circles
as madame l'amour.

657
01:01:57,664 --> 01:01:59,230
Both, incidentally,

658
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:01,032
blackmailed me
for huge sums of money,

659
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:03,234
the countess and the prostitute.

660
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:06,237
I expected better
of the prostitute.

661
01:02:07,272 --> 01:02:11,442
Now, I have many vices,

662
01:02:13,111 --> 01:02:15,646
hypocrisy is not one of them.

663
01:02:17,115 --> 01:02:21,152
So you will resume your duties,

664
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,220
but this time,

665
01:02:24,556 --> 01:02:27,692
you will be more discreet.

666
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:34,165
Thank you, your highness.

667
01:02:50,282 --> 01:02:52,416
His highness will see you now.

668
01:03:00,192 --> 01:03:02,226
Telephone message for you,
captain.

669
01:03:11,203 --> 01:03:12,303
You sent for me?

670
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:14,105
I've got something
to show you.

671
01:03:15,607 --> 01:03:18,609
It was the fucking pastor!

672
01:03:18,611 --> 01:03:20,611
We found the radio set
and everything.

673
01:03:20,613 --> 01:03:22,213
Dirksen knocked him out
last night,

674
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,981
or we would have started sooner.

675
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:26,517
Still, we should have
everything we need by tonight.

676
01:03:39,331 --> 01:03:41,098
Good work, inspector.

677
01:04:13,532 --> 01:04:16,367
I'm sorry I could not count
on you this morning, sigurd.

678
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:19,603
And your attitude since the news
of herr himmler's visit

679
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,272
is far from what I'd hoped.

680
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:24,241
I long for the restoration

681
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:26,210
of the monarchy
as much as you do.

682
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:29,246
And yet I fear this meeting

683
01:04:29,248 --> 01:04:31,215
carries with it
a very grave risk.

684
01:04:32,184 --> 01:04:35,386
- What do you mean, sigurd?
- The kaiser's temper is short.

685
01:04:35,787 --> 01:04:37,755
Should himmler provoke him
to rage,

686
01:04:37,757 --> 01:04:39,223
as goering nearly did,

687
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:40,791
his highness could lose
everything.

688
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:42,760
Not only the annual allowance

689
01:04:42,762 --> 01:04:46,564
they so generously Grant him,
but his life.

690
01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:48,099
The night of the long knives

691
01:04:48,101 --> 01:04:50,067
taught us
who and what they are.

692
01:04:50,069 --> 01:04:52,636
The fuhrer simply dealt
with a few Jews and communists.

693
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,239
The former chancellor
and his wife

694
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:58,142
gunned down in their own home.

695
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,276
Nobody is safe,

696
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:01,178
not even you.

697
01:05:04,649 --> 01:05:06,751
Then you must make sure
he is not provoked,

698
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:09,353
mustn't you, colonel?

699
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,157
Your highness.

700
01:05:58,503 --> 01:05:59,837
Captain?

701
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:08,779
He's here. He's here.

702
01:06:08,781 --> 01:06:10,247
Hmm-hmm.

703
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:32,837
Attention!

704
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:06,937
Herr reichsfuhrer,
i am sigurd Von ilsemann.

705
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:10,774
- Welcome to huis doorn.
- Heil Hitler.

706
01:07:12,244 --> 01:07:15,613
May I present captain Brandt
of the eighth infantry regiment?

707
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:18,983
- He commands the army here.
- Captain.

708
01:07:36,301 --> 01:07:39,503
May I present prince
friedrich Wilhelm Victor...

709
01:07:39,505 --> 01:07:40,371
Heil Hitler.

710
01:07:44,509 --> 01:07:48,679
Herr reichsfuhrer,
welcome to our humble home.

711
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:52,483
We are delighted you could spare
the time from your duties

712
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,719
and we are sorry your dear wife
is unable to be with you

713
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:57,588
on this occasion.

714
01:07:58,523 --> 01:08:00,991
You will, we hope, allow us,

715
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:04,662
as representatives
of the hohenzollern dynasty

716
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,363
and the royal house of prussia,

717
01:08:06,365 --> 01:08:08,465
to congratulate you
and the fuhrer

718
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:10,634
on the latest
of your astounding series

719
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:12,036
of great victories.

720
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,539
The national socialist
Democratic workers' party

721
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:18,909
thanks you for your kind words
and your loyal support.

722
01:08:23,048 --> 01:08:24,915
May I show you to your rooms?

723
01:08:26,017 --> 01:08:27,084
Thank you.

724
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:29,620
It's been a tiring journey.

725
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:39,296
May I request, before dinner,

726
01:08:39,298 --> 01:08:41,632
the pleasure
of a private audience?

727
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:45,536
That is to say,
a meeting on matters of state.

728
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,837
I shall arrange it.

729
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:02,853
- I need to see you.
- Not now.

730
01:09:02,855 --> 01:09:04,021
Yes, now!

731
01:09:04,923 --> 01:09:08,559
No, we were told to be discreet.

732
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,095
The pastor's been arrested
by the gestapo.

733
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:13,097
They're interrogating him now.

734
01:09:13,099 --> 01:09:15,799
Soon he'll tell them
everything he knows.

735
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,873
- Why tell me?
- Why sleep with me?

736
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,541
- Why ask me?
- Following orders?

737
01:09:24,543 --> 01:09:26,744
No, it was a mistake, a madness.

738
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:27,745
You used me!

739
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,548
- I used myself.
- If you wanted to kill him,

740
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,684
you could have done that
any time.

741
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:37,187
- I'll scream the house down!
- You will when Dietrich starts.

742
01:09:40,925 --> 01:09:42,626
How did you know?

743
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,928
I saw you with him
at the church.

744
01:09:46,064 --> 01:09:48,599
And you're a Jew
who knows German army medals

745
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,901
and keeps gun oil hidden
in her room.

746
01:09:51,736 --> 01:09:55,906
Then, captain,
you must do your duty.

747
01:09:59,077 --> 01:10:01,812
Just leave. Leave now.

748
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:05,149
Please.

749
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:07,918
I can't.

750
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,521
Do you expect me
to betray my oath,

751
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:12,056
my country, for you?

752
01:10:12,058 --> 01:10:14,858
I expected nothing from you,
captain.

753
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:20,998
You must do your duty.
And I will do mine.

754
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:15,919
Forgive me, herr reichsfuhrer.

755
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:25,829
What can I do for you?

756
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,735
This is for you,
herr reichsfuhrer.

757
01:11:31,737 --> 01:11:33,771
I'm sure a man in your position

758
01:11:33,773 --> 01:11:35,973
must have
so many unforeseen expenses,

759
01:11:35,975 --> 01:11:38,475
in your positions...

760
01:11:38,477 --> 01:11:40,844
It can be so difficult
to make ends meet.

761
01:11:40,846 --> 01:11:43,313
Certainly,
i know in my own household...

762
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:46,984
Servants are so expensive,
especially in wartime.

763
01:11:46,986 --> 01:11:49,753
So difficult to keep.

764
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:02,232
Thank you.

765
01:12:14,846 --> 01:12:15,979
Oh!

766
01:13:04,062 --> 01:13:05,562
Here you are!

767
01:13:05,564 --> 01:13:07,798
I was worried.
It's almost time for dinner.

768
01:13:11,336 --> 01:13:12,936
Wilhelm?

769
01:13:18,676 --> 01:13:23,380
It seems we are to go back
to Berlin.

770
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:26,216
If we choose.

771
01:13:29,587 --> 01:13:31,188
Can that be true?

772
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,358
You are to be king again?

773
01:13:44,035 --> 01:13:46,703
I'm afraid I'm going to need
a new wardrobe.

774
01:13:52,377 --> 01:13:55,913
For now I think we should
keep this to ourselves.

775
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:05,322
Oh, my dear frau linnenkamp.

776
01:14:05,324 --> 01:14:07,991
First thing tomorrow,
i shall say no more,

777
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:10,427
we must start packing the house.

778
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:16,700
Your highness.

779
01:14:17,769 --> 01:14:21,405
May I be the first
to offer my congratulations.

780
01:14:22,006 --> 01:14:23,273
Oh.

781
01:14:25,143 --> 01:14:27,744
I know we both had reservations
about these people

782
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:31,248
and all the people in power,
but...

783
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:36,753
that both they and the German
people can only benefit

784
01:14:36,755 --> 01:14:38,088
from a firm

785
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,490
and Christian presence
on the throne.

786
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:43,460
A restraining influence.

787
01:14:45,863 --> 01:14:49,166
Perhaps god has not forgotten me
after all.

788
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,711
Make yourself at home.

789
01:15:00,713 --> 01:15:03,380
Some of us
weren't invited to dinner.

790
01:15:05,817 --> 01:15:07,417
So much for national socialism.

791
01:15:10,989 --> 01:15:13,323
Has the pastor talked yet?

792
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:16,893
I just called them.
It won't be long.

793
01:15:18,363 --> 01:15:19,896
Heil Hitler.

794
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:26,103
At ease, gentlemen.

795
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:30,073
Is that schnapps?

796
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:41,018
This will go no further.

797
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,856
I have just told
the former kaiser

798
01:15:45,858 --> 01:15:47,124
that the fuhrer has,

799
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:49,226
under strict conditions,

800
01:15:49,228 --> 01:15:51,361
and for the good
of the fatherland,

801
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:53,964
agreed to bring him back
from exile

802
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,832
to take up his throne in Berlin.

803
01:16:02,273 --> 01:16:06,143
I have to tell you now
that this is a deception.

804
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:10,180
Its aim is to flush out
any remaining monarchists,

805
01:16:10,182 --> 01:16:12,015
sympathizers, in the reich.

806
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:17,454
You two will work together
to intercept any communications

807
01:16:17,456 --> 01:16:19,289
in and out of the house.

808
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:24,094
you will find out
where they come from
and where they are going

809
01:16:24,096 --> 01:16:26,930
and report directly to my office
in Berlin.

810
01:16:28,099 --> 01:16:28,965
Heil Hitler.

811
01:16:33,504 --> 01:16:35,005
Any questions?

812
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,607
Good.

813
01:16:57,995 --> 01:16:59,296
Captain.

814
01:16:59,564 --> 01:17:01,198
Thank you.

815
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,300
He's holding out. For now.

816
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:19,116
- Captain.
- Your highness.

817
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:24,488
I'm starving.

818
01:17:25,022 --> 01:17:27,390
We'll take a break
until he comes round again.

819
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:31,595
<i> The Americans
 will stay out this time.</i>

820
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,097
They are decadent,

821
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:36,566
no fonder of the Jews
and communists than we are.

822
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,169
There I disagree with you.

823
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:42,172
We face
an international conspiracy

824
01:17:42,174 --> 01:17:44,074
funded by Jewish capital

825
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,143
which has its home in America.

826
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:49,579
It will have to be defeated
sooner or later.

827
01:17:49,847 --> 01:17:51,348
I'm glad to hear you say that.

828
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:54,084
You had 30 years to do something
about the Jews,

829
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:58,355
and yet you just let them
get on with it.

830
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,024
We had other priorities.

831
01:18:01,026 --> 01:18:03,160
But you had Jewish friends,
didn't you?

832
01:18:03,162 --> 01:18:04,294
I'm sure I read that.

833
01:18:04,296 --> 01:18:08,865
In the last war, the German Jews
fought and died for our country

834
01:18:08,867 --> 01:18:11,034
- in their thousands.
- What's your point?

835
01:18:11,036 --> 01:18:13,570
It's fair to say that few people
really understood

836
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:15,405
the Jewish threat
until the '20s.

837
01:18:15,407 --> 01:18:17,941
For that we are very grateful
to the fuhrer.

838
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,076
The problem
is the same everywhere,

839
01:18:20,078 --> 01:18:21,578
but only now, in Germany,

840
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:25,148
is there sufficient clarity
to admit the scale of the task

841
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,083
and to examine
the potential solutions

842
01:18:27,085 --> 01:18:30,420
in a thorough
and an imaginative manner.

843
01:18:30,422 --> 01:18:32,255
And yet, where we lead

844
01:18:32,257 --> 01:18:34,090
I'm sure
that others will follow.

845
01:18:34,525 --> 01:18:36,459
Germany needs more room
for its people,

846
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:37,994
especially in the east,

847
01:18:37,996 --> 01:18:39,529
and for that
there will have to be

848
01:18:39,531 --> 01:18:41,565
a re-ordering
of other populations.

849
01:18:41,567 --> 01:18:43,533
Where relocation is impractical,

850
01:18:43,535 --> 01:18:45,368
a more sensible solution
must be found.

851
01:18:45,903 --> 01:18:47,938
The elderly, the mentally ill,

852
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,106
are a drain
on the reich's resources.

853
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:52,642
Not to mention the children,
of course.

854
01:18:53,945 --> 01:18:56,046
In wartime, it is
hardly feasible to feed them

855
01:18:56,048 --> 01:18:58,281
until they can provide
the return on capital.

856
01:18:59,951 --> 01:19:03,119
And we are very much
at the experimental stage.

857
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:05,288
I attended
one demonstration recently

858
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:07,190
at the laboratory in potsdam

859
01:19:07,192 --> 01:19:10,160
where ten disabled children
were each given

860
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,262
a red balloon to play with

861
01:19:12,264 --> 01:19:14,030
and then injected in the heart

862
01:19:14,032 --> 01:19:16,066
with a solution
of concentrated phenol.

863
01:19:18,035 --> 01:19:21,104
- I beg your pardon?
- Phenol.

864
01:19:21,106 --> 01:19:23,273
You probably know
it as carbolic acid.

865
01:19:23,275 --> 01:19:24,608
It's easily soluble.

866
01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:27,644
They appear to have passed away
in their sleep,

867
01:19:27,646 --> 01:19:29,446
but the doctor
and his assistant,

868
01:19:29,448 --> 01:19:31,181
who are both very skilled,

869
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:34,317
could only manage ten
in a minute.

870
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:36,253
So I fear it's hardly practical

871
01:19:36,255 --> 01:19:38,455
on the scale
we may eventually need.

872
01:19:55,506 --> 01:19:58,475
Will you take some Brandy
and a cigar, herr himmler?

873
01:20:02,546 --> 01:20:05,615
Yes, yes, and I will show you

874
01:20:05,617 --> 01:20:09,986
my collection of pg wodehouse.

875
01:20:09,988 --> 01:20:11,054
First editions.

876
01:20:13,324 --> 01:20:17,227
I'm afraid I must go.
I have an early start tomorrow.

877
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:32,542
We have an understanding,
i think?

878
01:20:34,211 --> 01:20:35,779
Indeed, we do.

879
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:57,300
Brandt, they are the rule.
You are the exception.

880
01:21:05,109 --> 01:21:07,344
Tell me if the pastor
gives you anything.

881
01:21:07,346 --> 01:21:10,380
Ah, good to see you finally
taking an interest, Brandt.

882
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,331
You were wonderful.

883
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:31,234
I was very proud of you.

884
01:22:16,313 --> 01:22:19,549
You are a bloody fool, sigurd.
You almost ruined everything.

885
01:22:28,559 --> 01:22:29,859
Colonel.

886
01:22:33,831 --> 01:22:35,799
I've been wondering something.

887
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:42,872
Can an officer have
a loyalty to anything

888
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:45,341
greater than his country?

889
01:22:47,812 --> 01:22:51,548
First,
he must answer the question,

890
01:22:52,783 --> 01:22:54,217
"what is my country?"

891
01:22:56,587 --> 01:22:58,455
"And does it even still exist?"

892
01:22:59,457 --> 01:23:00,490
Hmm.

893
01:23:04,328 --> 01:23:06,896
The offer his highness received
tonight from himmler...

894
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,533
It's a trap.

895
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:15,738
They want to know who secretly
supports the restoration.

896
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:21,711
I trust you will inform
his highness accordingly.

897
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:26,916
If you'll excuse me.

898
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:37,327
Captain?

899
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:43,733
Thank you.

900
01:24:03,988 --> 01:24:05,955
Is something wrong?

901
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,359
- I have to go now. Forever.
- Oh...

902
01:24:10,294 --> 01:24:11,361
But first I...

903
01:24:11,363 --> 01:24:12,695
I have a message for you.

904
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,067
From Winston Churchill.

905
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,911
Of course you do.

906
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,748
You're the secret agent.

907
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:38,054
Marvelous.

908
01:24:44,528 --> 01:24:45,762
Help!

909
01:24:47,498 --> 01:24:48,731
Help!

910
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,900
Help!

911
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:55,805
Help!

912
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:59,509
Help!

913
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:03,079
It's the kaiser, he's collapsed!
No, get him to hospital now!

914
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:14,991
What happened? Is he dead?

915
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,927
We spoke and then I left.

916
01:25:17,929 --> 01:25:20,029
He picked up his axe
and then fell.

917
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:21,598
You should have gone
hours ago.

918
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,498
I'll go now.

919
01:25:26,437 --> 01:25:27,604
Brandt.

920
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:34,777
I'll find her.

921
01:25:37,314 --> 01:25:38,548
Gestapo.

922
01:25:38,816 --> 01:25:39,749
They know.

923
01:25:48,425 --> 01:25:51,461
They are coming for you now.
You'll never make it.

924
01:25:52,763 --> 01:25:54,597
Mieke, trust me.

925
01:26:05,376 --> 01:26:06,909
It's Brandt. Listen,

926
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:09,479
one of the female servants
is an enemy agent.

927
01:26:09,481 --> 01:26:12,548
Get all the men out. Seal off
the exits and the perimeter.

928
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:14,717
And nobody,
nobody gets in or out

929
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,719
without my permission. Clear?

930
01:26:30,567 --> 01:26:34,103
I'm perfectly well.
Just a little dizzy, that's...

931
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,104
I'm fine now.

932
01:26:36,407 --> 01:26:37,807
I'm all right.

933
01:26:37,809 --> 01:26:39,175
Please, don't fuss.

934
01:26:39,443 --> 01:26:43,546
I have told you so many times
not to exercise so after dinner.

935
01:26:43,548 --> 01:26:45,148
I must remember that. Huh?

936
01:26:48,452 --> 01:26:50,620
You... you won't believe...

937
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:56,459
I... I just received a message
from britain's prime minister.

938
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,896
- The boy Churchill.
- What? What message?

939
01:26:59,898 --> 01:27:01,097
What?

940
01:27:01,099 --> 01:27:04,033
He was offering me exile
in england,

941
01:27:04,035 --> 01:27:06,135
and then, when the war ends,

942
01:27:06,137 --> 01:27:09,939
the throne
of a defeated Germany.

943
01:27:10,774 --> 01:27:13,543
Imagine that!
Two offers in one night.

944
01:27:13,545 --> 01:27:16,079
Not bad, huh? After 20 years.

945
01:27:16,081 --> 01:27:19,248
- Oh!
- Wilhelm, please, please rest.

946
01:27:20,517 --> 01:27:21,851
Rest.

947
01:27:21,853 --> 01:27:26,122
Of course, I was very polite.
I said, "no, thank you."

948
01:27:26,124 --> 01:27:29,525
Of course. Please rest. Rest.

949
01:27:29,527 --> 01:27:31,194
Sigurd will be here in a moment.

950
01:27:31,196 --> 01:27:32,929
- Hermine.
- Hmm?

951
01:27:34,598 --> 01:27:36,199
There's something
i must tell you.

952
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:40,737
I shall not return to Berlin.

953
01:27:41,905 --> 01:27:45,708
I shall stay here with you,

954
01:27:47,678 --> 01:27:48,811
and I will never leave.

955
01:27:51,014 --> 01:27:52,749
Was it tonight?

956
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:55,184
That dreadful man?

957
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,654
I should never have
brought him here.

958
01:27:58,656 --> 01:27:59,956
Oh, I am such a fool.

959
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:00,990
No, no, no!

960
01:28:00,992 --> 01:28:03,659
Thank god, I'm grateful to you.

961
01:28:03,661 --> 01:28:05,828
But they are not all
like himmler.

962
01:28:06,463 --> 01:28:09,866
You will talk to the fuhrer,
and the man must be dismissed.

963
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:12,201
- Something must be done.
- Nothing can be.

964
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:17,073
No, they are not as we are,
as anyone is.

965
01:28:17,075 --> 01:28:19,242
We had to know that,
and now we do.

966
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:24,280
Oh! Look at me.

967
01:28:25,015 --> 01:28:27,049
My love.

968
01:28:28,519 --> 01:28:32,121
It's god's will. All of it.

969
01:28:32,923 --> 01:28:35,191
No. How can that be?

970
01:28:37,828 --> 01:28:41,130
And I'm content. I must be.

971
01:28:45,602 --> 01:28:46,636
Truly?

972
01:28:46,638 --> 01:28:47,837
Truly.

973
01:28:52,843 --> 01:28:54,310
Then so am I.

974
01:29:19,536 --> 01:29:20,903
It's that new servant girl.

975
01:29:31,748 --> 01:29:35,585
- He has chest pains.
- Dr. krahl is coming.

976
01:29:35,587 --> 01:29:37,653
- Don't fuss, sigurd.
- Quick, help!

977
01:29:40,157 --> 01:29:41,257
Careful.

978
01:29:41,259 --> 01:29:43,326
- Don't...
- To the house.

979
01:29:43,328 --> 01:29:44,694
The doctor is coming.

980
01:29:44,696 --> 01:29:46,596
Don't fuss, sigurd.
Don't fuss.

981
01:29:46,598 --> 01:29:49,799
- Careful.
- Yes. Yes. Just put me to bed,

982
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,334
that's all.

983
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:05,014
- Captain, open the door.
- He needs the hospital.

984
01:30:05,016 --> 01:30:06,148
Open the door!

985
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,850
Brandt,
the doctor is coming here.

986
01:30:07,852 --> 01:30:09,719
- Follow me.
- Brandt!

987
01:30:11,255 --> 01:30:14,991
But wait! I need to go with him!

988
01:30:41,285 --> 01:30:43,753
Mieke. Mieke!

989
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:53,829
The gestapo's coming for her.

990
01:30:54,264 --> 01:30:55,798
Well, get her in. Quick!

991
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,975
Why did you wait so long?

992
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:09,745
Did you think I was going
to turn you over to the gestapo?

993
01:31:09,747 --> 01:31:12,481
Well, of course, that's exactly
what I should have done.

994
01:31:20,857 --> 01:31:21,958
Halt!

995
01:31:24,027 --> 01:31:26,228
Open the gate, damn you!

996
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,064
We're looking
for an enemy agent.

997
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:30,866
So are we!
Open the fucking gate!

998
01:31:30,868 --> 01:31:33,102
Oh, Christ.
They're here already.

999
01:31:35,038 --> 01:31:36,472
Mieke, give me your gun, now.

1000
01:31:39,676 --> 01:31:41,477
Mieke!

1001
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:50,086
- Mueller, get that gate open.
- Sir.

1002
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:55,891
Move that car now!

1003
01:31:55,893 --> 01:31:57,059
Where are you going?

1004
01:31:57,061 --> 01:31:59,228
Hospital.
The kaiser's had a heart attack.

1005
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:02,198
- Our priority is the spy.
- Mine is his life.

1006
01:32:03,266 --> 01:32:04,934
They've sealed the perimeter.

1007
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,902
Take my men
and search the house.

1008
01:32:06,904 --> 01:32:08,904
I'll be back in an hour.

1009
01:32:09,973 --> 01:32:11,774
Get them up to the house!

1010
01:32:12,309 --> 01:32:15,011
Oh, come along.
Move that fucking car!

1011
01:32:15,013 --> 01:32:16,479
Get moving!

1012
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:28,891
- I'm checking the Van.
- It's the kaiser.

1013
01:32:28,893 --> 01:32:30,426
Get out of the way.

1014
01:32:30,428 --> 01:32:32,928
Ah,
we'll just take a little look.

1015
01:32:41,872 --> 01:32:42,938
No!

1016
01:33:10,934 --> 01:33:12,835
Oh, mieke.

1017
01:33:31,054 --> 01:33:32,922
You saved my life.

1018
01:33:39,029 --> 01:33:41,530
I'm glad we had the chance
to say goodbye.

1019
01:33:44,134 --> 01:33:45,601
I shall miss you.

1020
01:33:58,381 --> 01:34:00,349
Such beautiful hands.

1021
01:34:10,894 --> 01:34:12,361
Your highness.

1022
01:34:13,029 --> 01:34:14,997
Your highness?

1023
01:34:16,366 --> 01:34:18,067
Your highness.

1024
01:34:21,304 --> 01:34:23,439
Brandt! Brandt!

1025
01:34:32,849 --> 01:34:34,950
He's just asleep.

1026
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:57,139
Have you got somewhere to go?

1027
01:34:57,141 --> 01:34:59,208
An address.
Will you come with me?

1028
01:35:01,178 --> 01:35:03,412
I betrayed my country,
but I won't abandon it.

1029
01:35:03,414 --> 01:35:05,314
Please, you'll be shot!

1030
01:35:05,316 --> 01:35:07,483
I left two gestapo officers
to guard the gate

1031
01:35:07,485 --> 01:35:10,286
and took the kaiser to hospital.

1032
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:13,722
The enemy agent killed them
and escaped.

1033
01:35:19,095 --> 01:35:20,462
Don't be sad.

1034
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,167
I found something else
to fight for.

1035
01:35:32,242 --> 01:35:33,676
Me too.

1036
01:35:57,601 --> 01:35:59,435
I...

1037
01:36:03,206 --> 01:36:04,673
I know.

1038
01:36:16,052 --> 01:36:17,219
But will you marry me?

1039
01:36:24,227 --> 01:36:26,362
Come and find me after the war.

1040
01:36:29,032 --> 01:36:30,065
Is that a yes?

1041
01:36:32,235 --> 01:36:34,136
Of course!

1042
01:37:02,299 --> 01:37:03,732
Has she gone?

1043
01:37:15,612 --> 01:37:17,279
Thank you.

1044
01:38:13,203 --> 01:38:14,636
From the red cross.

1045
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:29,278
Your highness,

1046
01:39:29,446 --> 01:39:32,314
captain Brandt sent
a message from Berlin.

1047
01:39:35,485 --> 01:39:36,652
He has good news.

1048
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:39,822
Thank you, sigurd.

1049
01:39:43,159 --> 01:39:44,760
Of course he has.

1050
01:39:54,704 --> 01:39:55,771
There you are.

1051
01:39:56,439 --> 01:39:58,307
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

1052
01:39:58,309 --> 01:39:59,942
The prime minister
will see you now.

1053
01:40:01,878 --> 01:40:03,579
Thank you.
