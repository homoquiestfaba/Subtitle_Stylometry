1
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:19,516
Fantasy is at the center

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,490
of what
a serial killer really is.

3
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:26,287
You and I might have a bad
thought about a person.

4
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:30,134
A serial killer will take that
same kernel of an immoral

5
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:33,671
or illegal impulse
and dwell on it.

6
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,137
That kernel becomes a seed,

7
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:39,306
and from that seed
grows fantasy.

8
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,677
"Normal people
have healthy fantasies."

9
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,005
Meaning that they can
readily differentiate

10
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:46,212
between the real
and the unreal.

11
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:50,054
A serial killer will dwell on
that fantasy until he can

12
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,151
no longer resist the urge
to see it through.

13
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:57,634
And once he does act
on that initial impulse,

14
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,225
fantasy becomes reality.

15
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:09,196
*

16
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,374
Is it hard for you
to get up in the morning?

17
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,610
Has your life lost
a sense of purpose?

18
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,605
Do you feel like giving
up is the only option?

19
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,808

Now it's your turn.

26
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,226
Once suicidally depressed,
Mike turned his life around

27
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,656
when he decided to
become a serial killer.

28

killer, Mike's achieved

a level of success
and fulfillment

30
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,365

Operators are standing by.

00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:40,554
*

69
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,391
Hello?

70
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,888
[bell rings]

71
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,255
Hi, uh...can I help
you find something?

72
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,934
You guys are 0 for 3
on my girlfriend's list.

73
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,402
Um, yeah, sometimes our
videos are just a little bit

74
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,972
hard to find here 'cause
our classification system

75
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,441
is a little bit weird.

76
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,340
Along Came Polly,
The Breakup, Hitch.

77
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,854
Where would you look
for those movies?

78
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:13,876
Comedy.

79
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,881
[bell rings]

80
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:15,882
Genius.

81
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,724
I, I can type them into
the computer, and then,

82
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,519
'cause like sometimes
people misfile the boxes,

83
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,361
and then they
get kind of lost.

84
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:27,603
Yes, honey...
I'm still at the store.

85
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:31,225
Yeah, well, I'm moving
as fast as I can.

86
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,771
No.

87
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,667
Well, well sometimes it
takes a fucking village

88
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,109
to find a video.
What can I say?

89
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,505
Bitch.

90
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,037
What I'm doing is
I'm typing in your titles,

91
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,141
and then if they're in the back
I'll be able to bring them...

92
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,853
Whatever, just work your magic.

93
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,394
My computer's frozen.

94
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:54,987
No shit.

95
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,323
I'm gonna restart it.
It'll take, like, 30 seconds.

96
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:58,455
[phone rings]

97
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,859
God damn it, Jenny.
What?

98
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:01,931
Yeah.

99
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,729
No.

100
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,270
I told you they
don't have that.

101
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,366
The fucking 'tard
they got working here

102
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,599
can't do shit.

103
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,844
Yeah.

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Fine.

105
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,508
It'll take, like, five seconds.

106
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,510
I'm just gonna look
for something else.

107
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,261
Hey.

108
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,586
Oh, hey.

109
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,025
You're lookin' for a--
are you lookin' for

110
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,626
another slasher film?

111
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,198
No, actually I was
wondering if you had,

112
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,996
"Along Came Polly"?

113
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:38,928
I, I don't--

114
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,832
I don't think we have
it in the system.

115
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,104
The computer's
all jammed, but--

116
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,042
Dude, I'm fucking with you.

117
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,937
I overheard that little
shit asking for it.

118
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,639
What a fucking dick.

119
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,481
I used to hate guys like that
when I worked in retail.

120
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,577
Yeah, right.

121
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:53,208
How about I get
the movies you want,

122
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,883
and I'll go to sleep?

123
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,815
What would
you do to him...

124
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,891
if you could do anything
you wanted to?

125
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,599
Anything and not get caught?

126
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,133
Anything?

127
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,969
I can see those
gears turning.

128
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,407
If you could do
anything you wanted...

129
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,724
Think about it.

130
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,485
I can't even say.

131
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,817
Yeah, you can.

132
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,473
(customer on phone)
Every time we do this.

133
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,736
No, we're not
getting licorice.

134
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,513
Fuckin' black licorice.

135
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,435
I hate that shit anyway.

136
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,106
Nobody's gonna
hear you except me.

137
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,478
And I'm your ally.

138
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:04,477
If I could do anything
in the world to that guy...

139
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,616
I'd, uh...

140
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:15,131
I'd go to a hardware
store and, uh...

141
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,165
I'd get a sledgehammer.

142
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,938
Really?

143
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:29,505
And then smash his head
with the sledgehammer.

144
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,678
Really?
That's creative.

145
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:37,181
It's a little messy,
but it's creative.

146
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,492
I'm just jokin', you know?

147
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:41,288
Jokin' around.

148
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,958
I'd, um, I'd just, like,

149
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,687
get a gun and shoot him
in the neck.

150
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,864
Right in the neck.

151
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,143
Is that real?

152
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,707
Yeah, it's fuckin' real.

153
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:04,039
You can't kill someone
with a fake gun.

154
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,954
Unless you bash them
in the head with it.

155
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,887
You mean...
you've iced a guy?

156
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,639
[whispers]
I've always wanted
to kill someone.

157
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,143
And you can.

158
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,709
What do you mean?

159
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:42,422
If you want to learn,
I can teach you to kill

160
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,685
as many people as you want.

161
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:49,819
I don't know.

162
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,193
No, I think you do know.

163
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:57,973
I come in here all the time,
and every time I see you...

164
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,970
I see a guy that's not
happy with his life.

165
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,340
- You can tell that?
- Uh huh.

166
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:11,084
And I see that there's
a version inside of you

167
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:15,878
that's just waitin'...
to break out.

168
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,389
You know exactly what I'm
talking about, don't you?

169
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,560
(customer)
What the fuck, honey?

170
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,025
No, I'm not
doing this with you.

171
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:37,641
See, life comes down to a few
short moments when you have

172
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,368
to ask yourself...

173
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,483
am I living up
to my potential?

174
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:50,646
Am I in it...
to win it?

175
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,162
Shit for selection.

176
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,304
What's it gonna be?

177
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,165
Are you in it to win it?

178
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,780
I am in it to win it.

179
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,354
You got a lot to
learn before you can

180
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,745
put your hands on a weapon.

181
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,520
So what do you say?

182
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,058
You wanna go
get this asshole?

183
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,455
Yeah.

184
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,258
[bell rings]

185
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:36,433
Let's take the back...
before he gets away.

186
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,538
Hey, dip shit.

187
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,779
Hey, you know what's
fuckin' hilarious?

188
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,675
Is that you chose to act
like a fuckin' asshole

189
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:50,937
on your last day on earth.

190
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:51,914
[gunshot]

191
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,219
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You all right?

192
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,989
You still with me?

193
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:07,556
Guys like this, they take
their lives for granted.

194
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,100
And the thing is,

195
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,998
is that we're all
just so fuckin' fragile.

196
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:19,008
I'm a reminder to these people
that they need to appreciate

197
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,506
their life each and every day.

198
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:28,247
So you're kind of,
you're kind of doing,

199
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,278
doing people a favor.

200
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,124
You're goddamn right I am.

201
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,022
Looks like we got a live one.

202
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,794
[gunshot]

203
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,702
What do you do
with the body?

204
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,768
Depends.

205
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,199
Is shithead here
a regular customer?

206
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,366
Yeah?

207
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,944
I got a couple acres out in
the desert with a shack on it.

208
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:57,744
Your secret hideout?

209
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,805
Yeah, kind of.

210
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,124
Take him out there,
chop him up,

211
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,815
throw some dirt on him -
be on the safe side.

212
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,818
Grab the shell casings,
I'm gonna throw

213
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,493
fuck-face in the trunk.

214
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,265
Welcome to your new life.

215
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,995
You follow my lead,
you'll be selling

216
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,470
the blood-soaked clothes
of your victims on eBay.

217
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,508
Listen, I got to run,
call the city,

218
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,677
have this car towed.

219
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,535
Don't touch anything.

220
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,283
Just go back inside.

221
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,276
Should, should I get
your phone number?

222
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,753
No need.

223
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,221
I know where to find you.

224
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,020
I want to make you
a superstar, pal.

225
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,964
So Mike's...

226
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,233
he's taken me on
as his apprentice.

227
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:58,174
I'm kind of nervous
'cause I'm not, like,

228
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:02,511
I'm not now nor have
I ever been a star student.

229
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:06,409
But, you know, they say,
they say you can accomplish,

230
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,783
like, anything if you put
your mind to it.

231
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,892
And.. I've never
really found anything

232
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:16,385
that I really wanted
to put my mind to.

233
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:21,059
Serial killing -
I think I could really,

234
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,231
really sink my teeth into that.

235
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,201
Apply myself.

236
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,268
[car horn honks]

237
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,808
- Hello.
- What took you so long?

238
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:43,353
There was a mad rush
at the video store.

239
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,020
Well, your ice cream's
all melted.

240
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:46,689
It's all right.

241
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,886
It's still good.

242
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,029
Did you cut
yourself shaving?

243
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,155
No, I don't think so.

244
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,300
That's weird.

245
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,732
Well, you caught me red-handed.

246
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,374
I had a strawberry
sundae at lunch.

247
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,884
Mr. Health Conscious
had a sundae for lunch?

248
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,748
Um, well, yeah, I mean,

249
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,075
I've just been
down a little bit,

250
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,981
and I thought maybe some
ice cream might cheer me up.

251
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,654
Are you feeling down?

252
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,521
A little.

253
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,920
Did something happen today?

254
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,363
No, it's just,
work's stressful.

255
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,529
You want to get
it off your chest?

256
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,329
No, it's no big deal.

257
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,802
Just petty stuff.

258
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,870
You listen to me
go on and on

259
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,638
about the politics
of the shelter.

260
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,007
I mean, I'm happy to listen
if you wanna talk about it.

261
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,142
Thank you.

262
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,724
I'm a pretty lucky guy
to have a girl like you.

263
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,721
And I'm a lucky girl.

264
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,459
Can you, um, hold that?

265
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,028
Mm hmm.

266
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,656
Try not to spill it.

267
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,764
I love Mike.
He's a great guy.

268
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:07,732
He's smart, he's caring,
he's emotionally intelligent.

269
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,174
And he's cute.

270
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,310
We've been together about
a year, and I think that's

271
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,636
really when people start
to show their true colors.

272
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:21,983
So the honeymoon is over,
but I'm really happy with him.

273
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,617
Emily Post found her fame
in writing a little book

274
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,463
entitled "Etiquette."

275
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,059
And it remains the authoritative
text on manners today.

276
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,374
Good manners
are very important.

277
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,966
They imply respect for
those in your presence,

278
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,240
and for the world in general.

279
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,138
There is a code of social
ethics and behavior out there,

280
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,252
and serial killing
is no different.

281
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,924
Hey, have you ever...

282
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,894
I've always been
curious, Bart.

283
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,056
But I won't do it.

284
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,125
Temptation surrounds
us in everything we do.

285
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,055
Immediate gratification
cannot be answered

286
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,360
to forsake principals.

287
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,261
Need to be strong
and make choices

288
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,773
that reflect our beliefs.

289
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,495
We gotta stick to our guns.

290
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,601
You said it.

291
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,739
We simply can't do
everything in life

292
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,607
that we'd like to, Bart.

293
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,035
I don't care how
annoying they are,

294
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,684
or how curious you might be,
children are off limits.

295
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,120
Stay away from the mentally
and physically handicapped.

296
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,287
That's cheating.

297
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,315
I've always loved animals
and never would do anything

298
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,461
to hurt our furry
little friends.

299
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:41,426
Sociopaths kill animals,
real serial killers kill people.

300
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,599
Never rob your victims.

301
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,467
You go down that road
it's tough to get off.

302
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,267
It starts off with a 20,
ends up with a C-note,

303
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,210
and then pretty soon
you're just a petty thief

304
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,135
who happens to kill on the side.

305
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,041
Don't rape.

306
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,082
Don't ever rape.

307
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:01,007
Rapists are the
scum of the earth.

308
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,254
Love women, respect women.

309
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,090
Find a way to earn their love.

310
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,416
There are over six billion
people in this world,

311
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,261
and it's no secret that
a lot of them deserve to die.

312
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,458
Just think - if I was in
Vienna right around

313
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,830
the turn of the century I might
have done away with Hitler.

314
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,869
You never know what kind of
service you're gonna do

315
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,125
the world by doing somebody in.

316
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,704
Kill people that
are better off dead.

317
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:27,443
I try to do at least one
selfless thing per day.

318
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,340
If you find yourself
thinking the serial killing

319
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,482
is selfish and you're doing it
just to make yourself happy,

320
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,679
take a trip to an elderly
home and find somebody

321
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,051
who wants to die but can't.

322
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,350
You don't have to
Kevorkify your life,

323
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,222
but you can give back.

324
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,461
Any little gesture
of kindness counts.

325
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,192
Look at this guy.

326
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,526
If you do not shit
on the count of three,

327
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,901
Daddy will take you
to the vet tomorrow

328
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:53,999
and he will have
you put to sleep,

329
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,870
you ungrateful
little cunt.

330
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,842
Did he just call
his dog a cunt?

331
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:04,182
One, two, three.

332
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,108
Okay.

333
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,424
But if you shit inside
like you did last night,

334
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,175
Daddy will smack your
ugly little face.

335
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,953
That kind of behavior
simply won't do, Bart.

336
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,262
What are you gonna do?

337
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,927
What time is it?

338
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,125
Uh, 6:30.

339
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:24,498
We're gonna
come back tomorrow.

340
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,937
Back in a sec.

341
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,240
Okay.

342
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:42,421
*

343
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,318
People don't like being alone.

344
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,487
But when you mix
the manipulative powers

345
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,786
of a sociopath with someone
with dependency disorders,

346
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,729
that's a very easy mix.

347
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:29,425
And a very highly
dysfunctional union.

348
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,369
Examples of this run the
relationship spectrum

349
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:38,866
from parent-child to
romantic attachments.

350
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,481
It never ceases to amaze me
what people will tolerate

351
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,905
in order to avoid being alone.

352
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,612
Misery loves company.

353
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,922
Hi.

354
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:51,747
Yeah, we're here.

355
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,021
Okay, see you in a sec.

356
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,690
Hang on a sec, baby.

357
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,833
You having fun, Bart?

358
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,855
Mm-hmm.

359
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,859
Good.

360
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,004
I can't tell
with you sometimes.

361
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,955
I'm havin' a ton of fun.

362
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,907
Come on, come on.

363
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,935
Come on.

364
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,981
Hey, there she is.

365
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,006
Hi.

366
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,483
- Hey, Bart.
- Hi.

367
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:24,022
We just saw this
little girl in the street,

368
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,686
she looked kind of lost.
So...

369
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,256
Aren't you just
a little cutie?

370
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,186
You guys think you can
do something with her?

371
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,460
Absolutely.

372
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,860
So sweet of you to bring
her all the way out here.

373
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:36,602
Yeah, no problem.

374
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,866
Where did she get the leash?

375
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,595
Oh, she was just draggin' it
behind her on the street.

376
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,936
Anyway, I got to
get Bart home.

377
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,467
See you there.

378
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,381
- Bye.
- Bye.

379
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,193
Man, what a woman.

380
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,488
Yeah.

381
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,727
Yeah?

382
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,996
Yeah, what?

383
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,555
Yeah, nothin'.

384
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,903
Yeah nothin', my ass.

385
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,198
What's on your mind?

386
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:16,039
Nothing, I, I swear.

387
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,335
Bart, I'm fuckin' with you.

388
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,410
I feel the most safe
when I'm with Mike.

389
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,650
Um, 'cause it's like,
it's like kind of having,

390
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,277
like, a pit bull that's
your best friend.

391
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,753
It can talk to you and stuff.

392
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,651
Because I just know no one's
gonna, like, mess with me.

393
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,264
I know that no, like,
gang bangers are gonna

394
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,555
try to mess with me.

395
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:40,157
And I know, like, other
people aren't gonna try

396
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,529
to mess with me or anything.

397
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:44,498
'Cause he's there, and he's
like, he knows how to--

398
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,667
He'll mess with them.

399
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,795
And mess with him
in a way that will just,

400
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,940
like, mess them up.

401
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,835
And it's cool 'cause
I feel safe and I know that...

402
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:56,579
I know that he would
never mess with me...

403
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,976
or hurt me or anything.

404
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,320
Once you've decided to give
serial killing a whirl,

405
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,323
the world becomes your oyster.

406
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,055
Observe your arsenal,
then pick your weapon.

407
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,404
Blunt objects.

408
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,469
Garrote.

409
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:27,672
Guns.

410
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,611
Poisons.

411
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,180
Drownings.

412
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,945
Assisted suicides.

413
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,029
Hit and runs.

414
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,171
Explosives.

415
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,814
[Tribal call]
Tribal weapons.

416
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:05,777
Garden tools.

417
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,248
The point I'm trying to get
across here is that there are an

418
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,190
infinite number of ways to
carry out your serial killings.

419
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,816
I've highlighted a variety
of methods, but what I want

420
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:19,263
to suggest is that you
start with something easy.

421
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,528
Something you've been using
since you came out of the womb.

422
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,059
Your hands.

423
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,070
[struggling sounds]

424
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,693
[crowd cheering]

425
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,129
Significant others will grow
increasingly suspicious,

426
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,101
but don't let your fears
get the best of you.

427
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,800
They probably just
think it's an affair.

428
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,613
If you want to be a good
little serial killer,

429
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:08,735
you must constantly keep the
people in your life at bay.

430
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,241
Do nice things for them.

431
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,882
Buy them chocolates, flowers,
take them for a nice dinner.

432
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,050
Make them feel secure in
the relationship, and they'll

433
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,849
never get to the bottom
of what's really going on.

434
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,856
Hey, Tom and Gena broke up.

435
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,131
Really?

436
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,699
Well, that's unfortunate.

437
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:33,668
I thought those guys
made a good couple.

438
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,266
She's better off.

439
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,337
He was cheating
on her for, like,

440
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,095
four months
with his assistant.

441
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,614
Really?

442
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,613
Can't imagine Tom doing
something like that.

443
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,609
What an asshole.

444
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,240
Oh, he was a creep.

445
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,554
Last summer at Rachel's luau
I swear I caught him looking

446
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:50,447
up my skirt when I was
laying on the hammock.

447
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,619
Really?

448
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,148
You should have
said something.

449
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,453
And cause a huge thing?

450
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,194
Why?
What good would it do?

451
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,688
You never know.

452
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,036
Seriously...

453
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,465
Let me know when
stuff like that happens, okay?

454
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,710
Why?

455
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,765
Would you have
defended my honor?

456
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,944
Indeed I would have, m'lady.

457
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,879
Go chop.

458
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,220
So are they selling their
house in Los Feliz?

459
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,917
Well, it's her place.
She kicked him out.

460
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,590
Really?
Where's he going?

461
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,859
Oh, he's at that crappy motel

462
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,887
down the street
from their house.

463
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,228
[chopping more aggressively]

464
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,707
(Abigail)
Christine's having a party
on Saturday night.

465
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,053
You want to go?

466
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:55,947
Oh, yeah?

467
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,178
Um, I would love to,
but I have plans

468
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,454
with young Bart on Saturday.

469
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,322
You're always with him.
What do you guys do together?

470
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,792
Just hang out.

471
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:12,495
Can I help you with this?

472
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:15,068
You don't really
have the eye for it.

473
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,537
I think you better
leave it to me.

474
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,666
You're a cruel woman.

475
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,167
All right, I'll get
back to cooking.

476
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,314
Make it good.

477
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,079
(Dr. Goldberg)
One of the most
terrifying characteristics

478
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,351
of a serial killer
is the multiple faces

479
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,790
that they can wear.

480
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:36,155
Since serial killers lack a
conscience, feelings such as

481
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,755
guilt, nervousness,
rarely enter into their minds.

482
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,029
And they become
very good liars.

483
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,170
One of the most striking
examples of this was when one

484
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:50,035
of Jeffrey Dahmer's captives
escaped from his apartment.

485
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,166
He was naked,
he had visible wounds,

486
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,841
and he actually
ran into the police.

487
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:57,841
Dahmer watched his victim
talking to the police,

488
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,914
he calmly approached them,
he explained that

489
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,452
they were lovers and that
they'd had a quarrel.

490
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,219
He was so calm
and so articulate...

491
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,858
the police actually let him
leave with his victim.

492
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:12,692
You got your Dahmers,
Zodiac Killers, Son of Sams,

493
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,892
Boston Stranglers,
Jack the Rippers.

494
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,704
But my point is--
Oh, that Aileen Wournos

495
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,126
is one hell of
a serial killer, too.

496
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,430
But they all had
a style, you know?

497
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,072
They found a way to own it.

498
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,838
Ownership of your
work is vital, Bart.

499
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,206
And that's the kind of killer
you need to strive to be.

500
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:30,675
Go big, find yourself
and express your voice.

501
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:33,607
You found your voice yet?

502
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,582
What does that mean?

503
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,691
Your style, signature,
your calling card.

504
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:41,386
I don't know.

505
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,357
Well, you'll know when you do.

506
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,055
Yeah, you're probably right.

507
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,228
You got to make every
killing count, Bart,

508
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,027
'cause you never know which
one's gonna be your last.

509
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,970
The thing you always got to
keep in the back of your head

510
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:57,065
is that life as we know it
could disappear at any minute.

511
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,238
Until age 30, the majority of
people can legitimately say

512
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,811
they've spent most of
their life in school.

513
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:07,511
Ages five to 11,
elementary school.

514
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,883
Ages 12 to 14,
junior high school.

515
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,452
Ages 15 to 18, high school.

516
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,551
Ages 19 to 23, college.

517
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:19,363
And ages 23 to 27, graduate
or professional school.

518
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,332
That's a lot of
classroom time.

519
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,171
And it's laughable when you
think about it because

520
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,666
whatever job you land in
immediately retrains you.

521
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,339
Experience is
the best teacher.

522
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,879
This helpful old adage got me
to thinking of ways to better

523
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,976
convey real-life examples
of what I want you

524
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,178
to get out of all of this.

525
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,720
The only way for you to
start anything is just to

526
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,376
get out there and do it.

527
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:47,722
You're a blank canvas.

528
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,060
And you need to go out
there and get painted.

529
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,900

00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,339
Do you want turkey or ham?

531
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,066
Turkey.

532
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,541
Thanks.
What do I owe you?

533
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,768
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- Cheers, I got the next one.

534
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:09,475
All right, thanks.

535
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,112
It's nice out today, huh?

536
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,381
Beautiful.

537
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,978
How is your day going?

538
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,154
Eh.

539
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,024
Do you hate your job?

540
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:31,355
I don't really look
at this as my job.

541
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:35,433
You know, this is just somethin'
I do that pays the bills.

542
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,404
Puts food on the table.

543
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,308
When you were little, what did
you think you were gonna

544
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,277
grow up to be?

545
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,875
I wanted to be
an astronaut, actually.

546
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,816
What happened?

547
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,946
It's very difficult to
become an astronaut, Bart.

548
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,322
There's a lot of math.

549
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,725
Plus, when I was
a kid I had no idea

550
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,486
that serial killing
was even an option.

551
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,334
It's just not something
they cover in Career Day.

552
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,931
Yeah.

553
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:11,703
Besides...
All work and no play...

554
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,013
Makes Jack a dull boy.

555
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,513
What are you doin' tonight?

556
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,377
Just hangin' out.

557
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,622
Why don't you come over
to the house around nine.

558
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,017
Okay.

559
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,860
If you think
it'll be all right.

560
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:34,786
I mean...
would that be all right?

561
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,933
Why wouldn't it be?

562
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,969
I kind of get the
feeling like Abigail

563
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,699
doesn't really
like me all that much.

564
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,514
Bart, she thinks you're great.

565
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,006
Stop being so insecure.

566
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,180
She's not getting suspicious?

567
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,575
Of what?
Of what we're doing?

568
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:01,254
No...
No, not at all.

569
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,293
Okay.

570
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,226
Why would you ask that?

571
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,426
I'm just, I'm just like
trying to, I don't...

572
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:13,571
I don't really think it,

573
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,495
I'm just tryin' to,
I'm tryin' to think it, like,

574
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,941
two steps ahead, like a, like
everything like a chess game.

575
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,608
So I was just-- I'm probably
just being paranoid.

576
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,481
Don't worry about it.
She's fine.

577
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:28,749
I hate to cut this short,
but I got to get back.

578
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,747
I've got a lot of
calls to make, so.

579
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,349
Yeah.

580
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,719
We'll see you at nine.

581
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,360
Nine o'clock, at your house.

582
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,215
Okay, buddy.

583
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:38,563
Thanks again for the sandwich.

584
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,157
Thanks for all the knowledge.

585
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,730
I don't know how you
know when you're ready.

586
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,429
I think it's sort of...

587
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:47,872
I think it's probably,
like, how Mike says.

588
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,936
I think you just
feel it in your gut.

589
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:53,036
And then you go with it.

590
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,311
Baker is such
a fucking faggot.

591
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,649
I mean, could you
believe this fucking guy?

592
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,075
What a dildo!

593
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,847
Always complaining
about Baker, Zach.

594
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,479
Dickhead Baker, faggot Baker.

595
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:06,424
Your point?

596
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,648
Who gives a shit if
the guy's a prick.

597
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:11,164
Me, you fucking dildo.

598
00:33:11,257 --> 00:33:12,317
Well, you hate
the guy so much,

599
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,594
why don't you do
somethin' about it?

600
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:15,633
Like what?

601
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,562
Well, you could slash
his fuckin' throat.

602
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:21,826
Like what, Mike?

603
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,043
You can start by
slashing his tires.

604
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,013
He drives a black import,
parks on the first floor

605
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:30,608
right by the elevator.

606
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,350
Thanks, man.

607
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,777
I'll do that shit right now.
You want to roll with?

608
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,423
Rain check.
Got a lunch date.

609
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,393
Go get him, tiger.

610
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:48,556
Slap it in with the palm.

611
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,860
Release.

612
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,331
Angle, slap, release.

613
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,499
Give it a try.

614
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,114
Good.
Release.

615
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,006
Do it with your thumb -
the same thumb.

616
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:04,408
Yeah, 'cause you
got to reload quick.

617
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,540
Good.

618
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,114
Oh, that's so cool.

619
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:13,489
Mike, does Abigail
know about this?

620
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,245
About what? The gun?

621
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:17,323
No, about, like, everything.

622
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,763
No.

623
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,788
Do you think she'd understand?

624
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,363
I don't know.

625
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,273
But I'd like to
think she would.

626
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,936
I know for a fact she'd tell
you I'd become a better person

627
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,995
since I started killing though.

628
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,635
You need to press down
with your thumb

629
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:36,281
before you load the bullet.

630
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,735
It makes it a lot easier.

631
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:38,583
Good.

632
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:39,547
Oh, yeah, yeah.

633
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:41,175
Cool.

634
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,621
What happens if she finds out?

635
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:47,216
She can't find out, Bart.
It's not an option.

636
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,192
I'm a trailblazer here, Bart.

637
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,731
Trailblazers are
typically persecuted

638
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,785
before they're embraced
by the mainstream.

639
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,826
Shit, look at Gandhi.

640
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,331
Yeah, he starved himself?

641
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,740
Then they shot him.

642
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,415
You don't think I'm smart
enough to keep this from her?

643
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:18,116
Is that it?

644
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,077
That's not what I'm sayin'.

645
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:22,285
I'm just sayin',
like, what if?

646
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:28,933
You can't be
a doubting Thomas

647
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,327
if you want to be
a serial killer.

648
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,259
I'm not a doubting Thomas.

649
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:35,232
[click, click]

650
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,968
Don't let negative thoughts
into your head.

651
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,539
[Abigail]
Guys?

652
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:43,984
Hey.

653
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,975
You guys want
anything to drink?

654
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,578
Oh, I'm good.

655
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Bart?

656
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,151
I'm good.

657
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,548
Well, just shout if you do.

658
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,764
Thanks, baby.

659
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:57,855
I'm gonna watch TV.

660
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,256
Thank you.

661
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,460
[whispering]
I'm not a doubting Thomas.

662
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,262
I know you're not
a doubting Thomas.

663
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:12,635
The truth is, I don't know
what she'd do if she found out.

664
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,888
Do you want to be a winner?
Do you want to be successful?

665
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,888
Of course you do;
Who wouldn't?

666
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,530
Well, here's the
key to my success:

667
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,625
Perseverance and discipline.

668
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,657
Good old P&D!
Perseverance and discipline

669
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:41,334
are the two qualities every
successful serial killer

670
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,873
must apply to his work
routine every single day.

671
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,969
And when the going gets tough,
that's when you need to

672
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:50,442
pull the trigger on good old
perseverance and discipline.

673
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,409
Ten million people
in this town,

674
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:58,854
you think it would be easier
to find someone to kill.

675
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,550
Should we call it a day?

676
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,923
Call it a day?
What are you?

677
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,492
A fuckin' quitter, Bart?

678
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:08,591
I'm not a quitter.
I was just thinking, you know.

679
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,864
Not thinkin' like
a serial killer, you're not.

680
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,002
Serial killers keep on
keepin' on, you got that?

681
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,998
I understand.

682
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,400
I believe in you, Bart.

683
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,402
You got what it takes, but you
got to want it bad enough

684
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:19,744
to go out there and get it.

685
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,408
No, I do want it.
I'll just keep on--

686
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:25,307
You say that,
but I don't see it.

687
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:29,381
Judge me not by what
I say, by what I do.

688
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,121
I was just sayin'--.

689
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,076
Just fuckin' shut up.

690
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,653
All right.

691
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:45,933
No, no, no, no.

692
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,471
You stay in the car.

693
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:48,866
- Why?
- You know why, Bart.

694
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,697
I want you to think about your
attempt to quit earlier.

695
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:52,773
I'm sorry, I--

696
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,211
Sorry is a word.

697
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,576
No, I mean it, I mean it.

698
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:59,745
Show me you mean it
through action.

699
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:01,675
How?

700
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:18,955
Why don't you find
us a good victim.

701
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:20,965
Okay.

702
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,543
Take your time, Bart.

703
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,935
Remember, it's got
to come from here.

704
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,667
Your gut.
Don't force it.

705
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:39,924
You tell me.

706
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:57,938
Him?

707
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,808
Is he a good victim?

708
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,007
Um...

709
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:06,008
Um...
Yes or no.

710
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,881
Yes, yeah.
He's a good victim.

711
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,120
Why?

712
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,793
Well, he just littered.

713
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,945
Got a thing
for litterbugs, do you?

714
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:22,029
It's pretty obvious...
he's not working.

715
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:26,159
He's like a drain
on taxpayers.

716
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:29,234
So you got a big
tax liability, do you?

717
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,104
No.

718
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,172
No, neither do I.

719
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,841
Well, they're lazy and they're
disgusting and they...

720
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,681
they smell bad and
they're always, like,

721
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:38,906
you'll be sittin' there at
a restaurant tryin' to eat

722
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,580
and they'll come up to you,
and they'll be...

723
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,580
And then if you're...
in your car

724
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:43,881
it's the worst,
'cause you're...

725
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,782
you're at a stoplight and
they're starin' at you,

726
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,324
like makin' you feel guilty,
makin' you feel bad

727
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:48,619
for not giving them money.

728
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,690
But they don't even work;
they don't do anything.

729
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:50,818
They hang out
at the beach all day

730
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:51,592
while you're doing
anything at all,

731
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,860
but not doing that.

732
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:58,902
It's fucking disgusting.

733
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,898
That man right there Bart's
not a victim for us...

734
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,572
He's a victim of society.

735
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,584
We need to show the
less fortunate compassion.

736
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:13,211
I'm sorry, I--

737
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,651
No, no. Not sorry.

738
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,517
Remember?

739
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:18,775
Action.
Not words.

740
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,961
Fifty cents?
Holy shit!

741
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,167
That's what I'm talkin' about.

742
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,152
It's been 11 hours, Bart.

743
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,522
Really?

744
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,762
Here's a little pearl for you...
Whenever it gets hard,

745
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,728
that's when you know
you're on the right path.

746
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:05,227
Whatever it takes
to get it done.

747
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,000
Whatever it takes.

748
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:15,141
Serial killers
know no boundaries.

749
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,610
They talk about principles,
they talk about strong beliefs -

750
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,880
ethics, if you will.

751
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,548
There is one simple truth
about serial killers:

752
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:25,148
They will do whatever it takes
to feel the satisfaction

753
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,820
of acting out their fantasies.

754
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,858
And they will eliminate
anything that gets in their way.

755
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,125
You know what I fuckin' hate?

756
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,202
Hmm?

757
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,870
Tailgaters.

758
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:46,269
Look at this fucking asshole.

759
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,571
He's really ridin' your ass.

760
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:50,813
Could he be any fuckin'
closer to my car?

761
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:56,715
You're in my fucking ass!

762
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:59,075
The guy's pretty big.

763
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,594
He's all, like,
on steroids or something.

764
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:01,886
I know. Watch...

765
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:04,217
Little tap on the brakes.
There you go.

766
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,222
There you go.

767
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:06,563
Oh, is that
slowing you down?

768
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:10,498
Is that fuckin'
slowin' you down?

769
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:12,296
Oh, the high beams.

770
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,457
Fuck you!

771
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,225
Hold the fucking wheel,
hold the wheel.

772
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:19,002
Fuck you!

773
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:22,765
[horn honking]

774
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,980
You know what's
fucking awesome?

775
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,248
This asshole has no idea what
he's gonna get himself into.

776
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:30,817
You never know about people.
You just never know

777
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,216
who's gonna have a gun
in their glove compartment.

778
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,689
Do you...have a gun
in your glove compartment?

779
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,316
No.

780
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:41,692
Bart, what kind of serial
killer would I be

781
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,833
if I didn't have gun
in my glove compartment?

782
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:46,599
Oh, this is good.
This is really fucking good.

783
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,628
Thank you, baby Jesus!

784
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,801
All right, let's--

785
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,473
Right over here, bitch!
Right the fuck over here!

786
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,372
I think he just
called you a faggot.

787
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:58,884
He's mouthing the
word faggot at you.

788
00:42:58,977 --> 00:42:59,237
Here we go.

789
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,151
Let's do this.

790
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,762
[gunshots]

791
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:22,866
Did you fucking see that?

792
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,242
[tires squeal]

793
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,089
That was a great
day today, Bart.

794
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,761
Oh, yeah.

795
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,325
All right,
we'll see you tomorrow.

796
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,729
All right, bye.

797
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,736
You gotta lighten up, Bart.

798
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,296
You gotta learn to trust me.

799
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:00,444
Oh, I do.

800
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:03,138
It doesn't seem like
you do sometimes.

801
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,641
But I do.

802
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,783
Okay, okay.

803
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,716
See?

804
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,188
I trust you.

805
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,290
Oh, I know.

806
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,517
I mean, I have to, right?

807
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:20,132
You can get me
into a lot of trouble.

808
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:21,255
I wouldn't do that.

809
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,389
No, but you could though.

810
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,463
I wouldn't though.

811
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:27,271
I know you wouldn't,
but you could.

812
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:28,825
Just sayin'.

813
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,773
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

814
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,312
I probably could get
you in some trouble.

815
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,937
Yeah.

816
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:42,848
I'd get to you...
before they got to me.

817
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:44,848
You know that, don't you?

818
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,020
You don't even
have to say that.

819
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:51,218
I don't even know
why you're sayin' that.

820
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,222
I'm fuckin' with you.

821
00:44:54,826 --> 00:45:00,726
Bart, I would not do
anything to hurt you, ever.

822
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,443
You're my protÃ©gÃ©.
You're like my offspring.

823
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:10,206
Are you pleased with what
you're learning so far?

824
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,108
Absolutely.

825
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,780
Good.

826
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:16,279
This is a very
unique opportunity.

827
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,981
Oh, I know, I know.

828
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,690
All right.

829
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:23,317
You drive safe, okay?

830
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,290
Didn't flinch, didn't flinch.

831
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,131
I'm very excited about
what I'm learning.

832
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,331
It's been, like, sort
of tough at first,

833
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,343
but now I'm really gettin' to,
like, the learning part.

834
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:39,165
And it's so much fun.

835
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:44,940
And Mike's, like,
a really good teacher.

836
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,153
I'm learning
a lot from him.

837
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:53,048
I'm going to go ahead and
assume that we've all wanted

838
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:58,791
to pull the trigger on behavior
that's illegal or immoral.

839
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,890
Haven't you ever fantasized
about pushing someone

840
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:04,332
into oncoming traffic,
or in front of a train?

841
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,429
Or off a building?

842
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,730
You know you have.

843
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:09,732
And it's only when we start
to act in accordance

844
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:16,235
with our core desires that we
are truly free to be ourselves.

845
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:20,551
We have to be in touch
with our inner emotions.

846
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:22,145
And obey them.

847
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,451
[giggling]

848
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:26,924
Oh, that's funny.

849
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:30,188
You don't have to pretend
to like it, sweetie.

850
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,958
I'm just not into
television humor.

851
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:38,131
Where are you going?

852
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,299
I'm just gonna
grab my jacket.

853
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:43,198
I thought we were
hanging out tonight?

854
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,301
Bart's been kind of down,
so I'm gonna

855
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:48,443
just take him out for a couple
of beers to cheer him up.

856
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:51,037
Oh.

857
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,592
Hey.

858
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,563
What are you doing?

859
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:44,801
Nothin'.

860
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46,696
Where are you going tonight?

861
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,027
Um, I don't know yet.

862
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:49,633
I don't know where we'll go.

863
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:50,844
I gotta go though.

864
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,196
Love you.

865
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:55,935
Do you love me?

866
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,235
No.

867
00:47:58,343 --> 00:47:59,043
No?

868
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:00,814
Fell out of love with me?

869
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:04,552
That's kind of mean,
don't you think?

870
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,249
[both giggling]

871
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:07,824
[doorbell]

872
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,956
Hang on a second!

873
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:16,632
You're the woman of my
dreams - you know that?

874
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,266
I know.

875
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:36,109
I'm glad Mike
has a social life.

876
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:38,954
I know he needs it.

877
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,790
But lately he goes out
almost every night.

878
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:44,286
Most of the time
it doesn't bother me.

879
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:51,304
But sometimes
it really bothers me.

880
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:11,447
Look at how fucking
cool this thing is.

881
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:14,549
I love that.
FÃ©eel how light that is.

882
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:15,422
It is light.

883
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,350
I know.

884
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,024
Wow.

885
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:18,922
Guess how much it was.

886
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:20,334
Like a thousand dollars?

887
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:21,425
Eighty!

888
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:22,426
Wow.

889
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:23,127
Is that bad for it
when you do that?

890
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:24,328
No.

891
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,199
That's fine as long as you
use your shirt or something.

892
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,997
Just don't use a paper towel.

893
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,244
- Eighty bucks.
- That's good.

894
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:32,866
You amortize that
over five years,

895
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,610
that's pennies a killing.

896
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,305
It pays for itself.

897
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:45,515
Looks cool too.

898
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,324
How's that?

899
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:51,393
Hold on, let me...

900
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,659
That's cool.

901
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,087
Good.

902
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:59,157
Just put that down
the back of the jacket for me.

903
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:16,181
Yeah...

904
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,578
I was getting ready too.

905
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:25,489
Stay put.

906
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,530
I'm gonna give
the lesson of the day.

907
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,685
All right.

908
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,261
Good luck.

909
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:53,345
[muffled screams]

910
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,531
[gagging]

911
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:11,601
Hey, Mike.

912
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,302
Aren't you worried when they
scream that someone will,

913
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,274
like, call the cops
or the police,

914
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:17,643
or come out and see
you or something?

915
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,205
Yeah.

916
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:24,223
But you gotta realize, Bart,
that most people aren't gonna

917
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:25,315
call the police
on the assumption

918
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,546
that somebody else
is going to.

919
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:31,118
Besides...the cops
are fuckin' slow -

920
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:32,422
especially in big
markets like Los Angeles.

921
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:35,233
When was the last time
you called the police?

922
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,196
Like a year ago.

923
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,225
Why'd you call them?

924
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,170
There was this,
uh, there was a mugging

925
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,366
outside my building.

926
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,797
How long did it take
for them to get there?

927
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:47,412
An hour.

928
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:49,805
And while the cops
were busy responding,

929
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:51,407
how many other people you
think could have been

930
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,579
assaulted during that time?

931
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,248
A lot.

932
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:57,576
So being good at
serial killing is about

933
00:51:57,682 --> 00:52:01,152
successful risk management,
and risk mitigation.

934
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:07,433
Good idea.

935
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:12,804
The identities of serial
killers are often obscure

936
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:16,467
because they have no
connection with their victim.

937
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:19,267
So they're propelled
into this double life.

938
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,040
A life in which they openly
interact with society,

939
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,379
and then a secretive life.

940
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,505
And even though they
have a double life,

941
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:30,381
they are drawn more and more
into that secretive life.

942
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,681
It's like a drug addict.

943
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,352
He takes more and more
of a given substance until

944
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:37,762
eventually he takes
too much and he overdoses.

945
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:41,225
The overdose here
happens when these two...

946
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:44,696
these two lives intersect.

947
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,339
From time immemorial the
majority of serial killers

948
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:53,996
have presented a major
problems for detectives

949
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,844
for one reason alone.

950
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,510
Their victims are complete
and total strangers.

951
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,650
If there is no immediate
connection between you

952
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:03,946
and your subject,
there's a very good chance

953
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:05,648
you can get away with murder.

954
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,490
The best victim is the one
you've never met before.

955
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:12,317
You start killing
people you know,

956
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:14,733
you're headed down
a dark road.

957
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,740
What's goin' on, man?

958
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,235
You all right?

959
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,638
Abigail found the safe.

960
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,940
Oh, shit.
Did she call the cops?

961
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:32,942
No.

962
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,283
Where is she?

963
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,000
She fuckin'
found everything, Bart.

964
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:53,955
I tried to explain...
I tried to explain it to her

965
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,074
but she wouldn't listen.

966
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,095
She kept trying
to call the police.

967
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,470
I couldn't let her do that.

968
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:03,736
Did anybody see you come in?

969
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,611
No.

970
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:13,247
Well, she screamed so somebody
must have called the cops.

971
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,291
We gotta get her out of here.

972
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,490
If somebody called the cops
we have to get out of here

973
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,658
because they'd be
here any minute.

974
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,486
We have to get her
out of here, okay?

975
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,132
And you need to help me
clean up that kitchen.

976
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:25,458
I don't think I can do that.

977
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:28,473
I can't do this, Bart.
I can't do this.

978
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:31,196
You have to help me do this.

979
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,542
You have to help me.

980
00:54:37,342 --> 00:54:38,412
Okay?

981
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:40,546
Yeah.

982
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:49,386
*

983
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:33,716
I wrapped her up.

984
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,400
We need to get her into the
car and get out of here now.

985
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:42,425
You okay?

986
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:47,712
We'll get you cleaned up and
get you into these clothes.

987
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,746
Shouldn't we be
doing this at night?

988
00:56:57,848 --> 00:56:58,378
No time.

989
00:56:58,483 --> 00:57:00,023
I'm losin' her.

990
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:05,124
You got it?

991
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:06,422
Yeah.

992
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:08,464
[car approaches]

993
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,029
What the fuck?

994
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:10,897
(man)
Mike?

995
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:11,855
Hey!

996
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:13,632
No, we're just--
a friend of mine's

997
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:15,101
havin' a bachelor party.

998
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:16,766
[gunshots]

999
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:19,703
Come on. We gotta move.

1000
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:26,779
(man #2)
Hey... Aw, shit!

1001
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:28,177
[gunshots]

1002
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:30,579
Don't leave me, Mike!

1003
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,622
[gunshot]

1004
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:39,555
Mike.

1005
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,206
Hey, Jake?

1006
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:00,910
Jake, it's Mike.

1007
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,411
There's a guy
with a gun out here.

1008
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:03,713
Please let me in.

1009
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:05,678
Come on, man.

1010
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:12,517
[gunshots]

1011
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,825
We can't fit four
bodies in this trunk.

1012
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,035
Exactly how fucked
are we right now?

1013
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:32,781
Pretty fucked, Bart.

1014
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,248
How fucked?

1015
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:38,354
Pretty fucked.

1016
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,078
But I mean, like,
like big-time fucked?

1017
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:39,953
Like super fucked?

1018
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,650
Could you just stop
for a second?

1019
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:43,693
Electric-chair fucked?

1020
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:45,988
Like how fucked?
Death fucked?

1021
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:55,528
Are you all right?

1022
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:06,708
You know how I met Abigail?

1023
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:10,045
At a dinner party.

1024
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:13,348
I was drunk as hell
on a mixture

1025
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,320
of champagne and tequila -

1026
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,620
which I don't recommend.

1027
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:24,126
But, uh, I was instantly
enamored with her.

1028
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:29,830
It's the easiest conversation
I've ever had in my life.

1029
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:35,511
I ended up kissing her
for the first time

1030
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:39,036
on the corner of
Santa Monica and Melrose.

1031
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,282
I was tryin' to get her
to come home with me.

1032
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:45,881
I fucking tried...

1033
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:48,223
But she wouldn't go for it.

1034
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,058
We ended up walking around
the neighborhood for a bit,

1035
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:54,085
and the Jacaranda trees
were just full bloom -

1036
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:56,261
the whole fuckin'
street was purple.

1037
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,732
I ended up falling
in love with her that night.

1038
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,810
Have you ever
been in love, Bart?

1039
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,369
Yeah, I think so.

1040
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:12,584
There, um...

1041
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:13,807
At my store
there was this girl

1042
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:16,651
that used to
come in all the time.

1043
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,417
And, um, she'd, like,

1044
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:19,975
she wasn't, like, really,

1045
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:21,754
like, 'stop you
in your tracks' pretty.

1046
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,522
But she had, she had, like,
a lot of freckles, and I,

1047
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,020
I like really like girls
with freckles.

1048
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,793
And I didn't really
talk to her, but we'd always,

1049
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:30,392
like, smile, and she'd always
rent that movie "Powder",

1050
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:31,864
the one with the albino kid.

1051
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:32,902
And she'd always rent it.

1052
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:34,027
Like, on Fridays.
I have no idea

1053
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,131
why she'd always
rent that movie.

1054
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,873
But it made me always
think about her and I was

1055
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,908
always, like, asking myself -
what I would say to her?

1056
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:42,735
Did you ever talk to her?

1057
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,640
It was more...it was
kind of like beyond that.

1058
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:46,983
I mean, I didn't talk to her.

1059
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:51,317
I don't think that's love,
but I mean, it's a start.

1060
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,285
You'll know when you
fall in love, man.

1061
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:00,732
It's like finding
your voice.

1062
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:01,285
I'm gonna wish that for you.

1063
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:03,426
Thank you.

1064
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:13,065
I want to start off by saying
the last thing you want

1065
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,810
to get mixed up in
is getting rid of bodies.

1066
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:18,506
It's dangerous,
time consuming,

1067
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:22,808
and if your stomach's weak
it can really be nauseating.

1068
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:39,999
Always remember -

1069
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:53,077
if there's no body...
there's no murder.

1070
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:55,347
Fingerprints will get
you just like teeth will.

1071
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,175
I've heard of slicing them
off with razor blades,

1072
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:59,121
or disfiguring them
with hot metal,

1073
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,846
but sulfuric acid
really works.

1074
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:04,091
And you can get it at any
chemical supply store.

1075
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:08,391
This will keep you clean,

1076
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:11,732
and this will make it
easier to wrap things up.

1077
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,599
Now once you've done
everything I've mentioned,

1078
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,367
it's time to get
rid of the evidence.

1079
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:34,119
Remember what
I said, Bart...

1080
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:36,048
When you've dug as
deep as you can dig,

1081
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:37,793
dig deeper.

1082
01:02:37,888 --> 01:02:39,818
And when you can't dig
any more, dig deeper.

1083
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:42,764
Then when there's
no more to dig...

1084
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,100
Keep diggin'.

1085
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:58,183
How long have
I been diggin' for?

1086
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,980
About nine hours.

1087
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:11,157
Remember what I said about
perseverance and discipline...

1088
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:15,925
I killed the woman I loved,
three witnesses...

1089
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:17,626
followed by an 11-hour
drive to the desert

1090
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,127
and nine hours of digging.

1091
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,970
You think maybe there's,
like, some kind of lesson

1092
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:25,097
to be learned from all of this?

1093
01:03:30,507 --> 01:03:31,837
That's a good question.

1094
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:35,183
Want to switch off
for a little while?

1095
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:36,309
Yeah.

1096
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,976
Thanks.

1097
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:58,104
I feel really bad for Mike.

1098
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:00,872
Um, he's, he's a romantic...

1099
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,171
and Abigail, I know,
was his, his muse,

1100
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:07,813
and it's just -
he's really devastated.

1101
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,608
It would be really cool if
there was somethin' I could do

1102
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:12,023
to, like, bring her back.

1103
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,723
What's our next move?

1104
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:20,962
Going home,
gettin' cleaned up.

1105
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:22,528
We can't go back
to your apartment.

1106
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:24,656
We're not going
to my apartment.

1107
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:27,331
We're going to yours, Bart.

1108
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,698
Mine?

1109
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,499
Yep.

1110
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:41,384
That's okay, Bart, I got it.

1111
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:42,608
I got it.

1112
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:46,118
You're my guest.

1113
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:50,053
Thank you.

1114
01:04:50,154 --> 01:04:52,664
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1115
01:04:53,857 --> 01:04:55,127
Thanks for your help
out there today.

1116
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,455
That was hard for me.

1117
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,590
I can imagine.

1118
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,069
You know, Abigail, she, uh--

1119
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:03,625
You know, I, I think,
I...bet there's

1120
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,973
someone else
out there for you.

1121
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,337
You think so?

1122
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:11,939
That's what I keep
telling myself.

1123
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:17,349
Here, this will keep you warm.

1124
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:19,277
Sleep well.

1125
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,491
This is a big
waste of time.

1126
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,960
Yep.

1127
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:29,728
That guy killed everybody
in the apartment.

1128
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:31,396
Why would he come back?

1129
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,460
This is crazy, Mike.

1130
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:41,214
Remember, Bart -
no bodies, no murder.

1131
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,465
Why are we
sneaking around then?

1132
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,643
Just in case.

1133
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:50,345
We got to see if
they're on to us.

1134
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,091
Fuck.

1135
01:05:58,422 --> 01:05:59,262
Shit.

1136
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:01,830
Shit, shit, shit.

1137
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:03,662
You see that?

1138
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,730
That means
we're a little fucked.

1139
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,730
There's got to be a way,
there's got to be

1140
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:08,871
a way out of this, man.

1141
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,925
There's, there's a way,
you got to--

1142
01:06:11,035 --> 01:06:12,765
You're the one that
should know the ways,

1143
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:13,869
find the way out
of this and we'll fucking

1144
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:14,570
take the way out of it.

1145
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,011
Bart, Bart, Bart.

1146
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:18,836
There are a couple ways
out of this - jail or death.

1147
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:20,442
[Mike laughing]

1148
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:22,054
That's fucking funny?

1149
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:22,846
No, there are
certain ways out--

1150
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,076
All right, all right.

1151
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,321
Fuck you, jail and death.
I can't go to jail.

1152
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,746
If I'm going to jail
I'm going to get raped.

1153
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:29,091
Just shut up.

1154
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:30,346
Those are the worst--

1155
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:32,024
I mean, you're such
a fucking idiot.

1156
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:32,822
Like, I'm too young
to go to jail.

1157
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,162
Would you just shut up?!

1158
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:35,488
Have you not listened to
anything that I've told you?

1159
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:39,232
I've listened to everything
you said and I'm fucked!

1160
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,999
You take a note for a while.

1161
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:42,898
Perseverance and discipline!

1162
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:46,897
Don't look to me
for external validation.

1163
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,843
You think living this
life is fucking easy?

1164
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:50,869
No.

1165
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:52,344
Nothing in this
world that brings

1166
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:55,012
any kind of gratification
is going to be easy.

1167
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:56,712
We all go through
periods of doubt, Bart,

1168
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:59,483
but you can't go fuckin' crazy.

1169
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:00,783
All right.

1170
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:04,152
You got to stay calm.

1171
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:05,364
You got to stay
on the path

1172
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:06,785
and you got to stay
true to the cause.

1173
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:07,620
All right.

1174
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:08,734
I got faith in you, Bart.

1175
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:11,625
I've got a fucking hell
of a lot of faith in you.

1176
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:13,158
Really?

1177
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:16,203
Hell, yes!
Motherfucking hell, yes.

1178
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,830
You didn't know that?

1179
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:19,174
I knew that.

1180
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,269
We all go through
periods of doubt, man.

1181
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,282
But when the winds of
change blow their gale,

1182
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,975
that is when you have
to lean against their fury.

1183
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,449
All right, all right.

1184
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:32,418
Fuck.

1185
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:35,046
Remember -
perception's reality.

1186
01:07:35,152 --> 01:07:36,922
You remember nothing else,
you remember that -

1187
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,360
Perception is reality.

1188
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:39,255
We think we can
get out of this,

1189
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:41,556
we're gonna get out of this.

1190
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:43,989
I think we're gonna
get out of this.

1191
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:45,104
We're gonna be fine.

1192
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:47,825
Uncle Mike has got
you covered, okay?

1193
01:07:51,335 --> 01:07:53,365
Where are we gonna go?

1194
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:57,442
You ever hear of a little
place called Mexico?

1195
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,281
[Bart laughing]

1196
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:02,077
That's where
we're goin', Bart!

1197
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:07,718
But first we got to take a
little stop off at the shack.

1198
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:10,389
All right.

1199
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:27,569
Plan for the worst,
hope for the best.

1200
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,308
What's in the cabinet, Mike?

1201
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:33,906
Oh, sweet!

1202
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,750
Is that rope?
I love rope.

1203
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:39,046
Bart, Bart, breathe.

1204
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:40,319
Good.

1205
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:42,647
Never underestimate the
power of cold hard cash.

1206
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,292
If you need to get out
of the country quick,

1207
01:08:44,388 --> 01:08:45,818
you're gonna need it.

1208
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:47,362
Wow, we're rich.

1209
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,457
Sorry.

1210
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,358
Your money.

1211
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:53,355
Good documentation
is absolutely imperative.

1212
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,863
And you'd be surprised
what you can get

1213
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,204
a graphic design student to do
for a couple of hundred bucks.

1214
01:08:58,302 --> 01:08:59,502
Oh, yeah, passports.

1215
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:00,643
I don't have one.

1216
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,367
That's cool, though.
Probably borrow one of yours.

1217
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,269
Always keep
a packed suitcase.

1218
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:05,978
What's in there?

1219
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,005
Grenades?

1220
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,584
Nunchucks?
What do you got?

1221
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:10,709
Ah, sweet. Clothes.

1222
01:09:11,215 --> 01:09:12,315
Have you ever heard
the expression -

1223
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:14,716
'Only use in case
of emergencies'?

1224
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,191
What's that?

1225
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:19,618
That's everything.

1226
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:21,093
Just-in-case case, Bart.

1227
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:22,691
What's in the
just-in-case case?

1228
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:23,862
A surprise.

1229
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,790
Yeah!

1230
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:26,995
Creating a new look
is imperative

1231
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,196
to getting away
from the authorities.

1232
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:35,514
Hydrogen peroxide.

1233
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,970
Why?

1234
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:39,444
Hair.

1235
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:44,381
[voice on police radio]

1236
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:10,442
What do you think?

1237
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,480
Wow...
You look really dangerous -

1238
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:13,076
and cool.

1239
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:14,476
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1240
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:15,978
You look like you're,
like, a lead singer

1241
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:18,349
of a punk rock band
or something.

1242
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:19,448
You know, I guess the
cops aren't gonna be

1243
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,649
lookin' for Billy Idol.

1244
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:22,891
That's for sure.

1245
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:25,016
Hey, should we
do my hair next?

1246
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:26,891
I don't really have
enough peroxide.

1247
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:30,058
What's wrong?

1248
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,059
Nothin'.

1249
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:33,261
Don't worry about it.

1250
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,997
You're not gonna
need a new look.

1251
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:38,767
You're gonna
love Mexico, Bart.

1252
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:43,574
It's all cervezas
and senoritas.

1253
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,110
[taser gun]

1254
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,308
[gunshot]

1255
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:52,679
The first rule in facing
the authorities is -

1256
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:55,692
never ask yourself
if you can get away.

1257
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:57,345
What's the magic
mantra we need to

1258
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:59,524
keep saying to ourselves?

1259
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:04,988
Perception is reality.

1260
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,304
If we think we can
get away, we can.

1261
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,840
Holy shit.

1262
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,210
What the fuck?

1263
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:27,275
Are there any more cops?

1264
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:34,791
That fuckin' cop shot me in
the neck with a taser gun.

1265
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,431
You got him.

1266
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,773
I think you got him
right in the heart.

1267
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:47,039
Lucky shot.

1268
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,340
You all right?

1269
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:53,541
Yeah, I--
Go get the peroxide.

1270
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:54,643
Why?

1271
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:56,254
Because it
disinfects cuts, Bart.

1272
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:58,076
Give me the rag, too.

1273
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:07,722
[police sirens]

1274
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,530
Shit.

1275
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,530
How many?
Get down.

1276
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,903
Uh, just, just one of them.

1277
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:20,342
That's okay.

1278
01:12:20,437 --> 01:12:21,707
One's doable.

1279
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:22,905
One's okay.

1280
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,484
There's two now.

1281
01:12:27,411 --> 01:12:29,851
Two is still great odds.
We can get out of this.

1282
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:36,851
Have you been involved
in a lot of standoffs

1283
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:39,223
with the police before?

1284
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,462
First one, actually.

1285
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:41,957
Keep an eye on the corner
of that shack, boys.

1286
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:44,888
I don't want anything comin'
out of there and surprising us.

1287
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,904
That's all right, 'cause I got
a lot of self-confidence.

1288
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:56,470
Mike, there's a third car.

1289
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,506
Mike, can you
hear me in there?

1290
01:13:05,248 --> 01:13:06,118
Hey, see him?

1291
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,375
We know who you are -

1292
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:10,094
this is not gonna
end well for you!

1293
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:13,755
Is this how we're goin' out?

1294
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:16,388
(Officer)
Mike?

1295
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:18,393
Mike, we got you surrounded!

1296
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:22,774
Is this it, Bart?

1297
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:24,026
Is this how we're
gonna go out,

1298
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,743
my young, faithful apprentice?

1299
01:13:29,473 --> 01:13:31,543
We can still make
it out of this.

1300
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:34,941
Mike, you're backed
up into a corner.

1301
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:36,184
You got nowhere to go.

1302
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,979
When we get out of this,
I want to, like,

1303
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,652
get some of my own pupils.

1304
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,820
You know, and like
start a school.

1305
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:44,319
I want to make a difference;
I want to show people

1306
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,490
there is a purpose
or all this.

1307
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,490
I'm proud of you, man.

1308
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:51,432
You're really takin' the bull
by the horns on this one.

1309
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,128
Now go get me that case.

1310
01:14:00,504 --> 01:14:01,974
That's a big gun.

1311
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:04,209
It has a big task at hand.

1312
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:11,011
(Officer)
Do yourself a favor, Mike.
Come out now!

1313
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,884
I'm afraid I can't do that!

1314
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:17,690
[gunfire]

1315
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,801
I'm out! Cover me!

1316
01:15:28,324 --> 01:15:29,294
Sean?

1317
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:31,033
Sean!

1318
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:32,097
Fuck.

1319
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:45,136
What the fuck are
you doin' in here?

1320
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:46,081
Nothin'.

1321
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:48,946
This son of a bitch
just took out half our guys.

1322
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,445
These guys got families.
You just gonna sit there

1323
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,446
and let that happen?

1324
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,847
He's got a fucking
machine gun.

1325
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:54,649
I don't care if he's got
a fucking grenade launcher.

1326
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,051
I've been friends with these
guys since you were

1327
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:57,992
a baby shitting diapers.

1328
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:00,885
Did you fuckin'
call the cops, Bart?

1329
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:03,025
No.

1330
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:04,026
No?

1331
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:05,327
No.

1332
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,302
Then how the fuck did
they get out there?!

1333
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,027
I don't know.

1334
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:10,903
Are you fucking crazy?

1335
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,840
Don't you fucking lie to me.

1336
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:14,966
I wouldn't call the cops.
I swear.

1337
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,441
We're gonna give
him to the count of ten.

1338
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:18,409
If he doesn't come out,
we're goin' in.

1339
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:19,307
You got me?

1340
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,538
They'll cut us apart!

1341
01:16:20,644 --> 01:16:23,484
We stand our ground, all right?

1342
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,979
Now put your fuckin' balls on.

1343
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:33,661
Mike, I'm gonna give
you to the count of ten.

1344
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:37,787
If you don't come out,
we're comin' in.

1345
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:39,104
Can you hear me,
you son of a bitch?

1346
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:41,625
Shut the fuck up or I'm
puttin' one in your head.

1347
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:42,601
We're on the same team.

1348
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:43,629
...nine...

1349
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:44,933
You really
disappointed me, Bart.

1350
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:45,904
...eight...

1351
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:47,242
You really disappointed me.

1352
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:48,706
Seven.

1353
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:51,266
Six.

1354
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:54,081
(Bart)
Don't shoot,
don't shoot!

1355
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:56,247
(Mike)
I'm comin' out
with a hostage.

1356
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,223
You move, he dies.

1357
01:17:00,316 --> 01:17:01,376
I know you're my friend.

1358
01:17:01,484 --> 01:17:03,354
Shut the fuck up, Bart.

1359
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,962
Mike, release the hostage.

1360
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:09,727
Release the hostage, Mike.

1361
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:12,831
Release the fuckin' hostage!

1362
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:14,299
You need to fuckin' relax!

1363
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,631
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

1364
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:21,869
You need to listen
to me, Bart.

1365
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:25,806
You tell them you're my hostage.
Do you understand me?

1366
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,480
Yeah, yeah.

1367
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:31,408
You say that
and you say nothing else.

1368
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:33,184
Okay.

1369
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:35,653
You got to trust me.

1370
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,120
Okay.

1371
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,419
Close your eyes.

1372
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:43,394
Mike, thank you.

1373
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,832
Thank you for everything.

1374
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:47,959
It's been a real honor.

1375
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:54,172
Come on.

1376
01:17:58,141 --> 01:17:59,181
He's alive.

1377
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:00,435
Good, come on

1378
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:08,122
Go see if he's on
the other side of this shack.

1379
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:12,617
On the count of three,
you go left, I go right.

1380
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:14,222
We're gonna kill
this son of a bitch.

1381
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:15,833
We should stick together.

1382
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:19,355
We're gonna split up
on the count of three.

1383
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:23,132
One...

1384
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:25,432
two...three.

1385
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:39,081
Drop it.

1386
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,403
No...

1387
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:54,195
You drop it.

1388
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:56,927
Drop the fucking weapon
or you're a dead man!

1389
01:18:57,033 --> 01:19:00,473
You gonna shoot me?

1390
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,009
I will if I have to.

1391
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:05,365
How you gonna do that
if I shoot you first?

1392
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,144
Don't make me do this.

1393
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:10,413
I'm gonna give you to the
three to drop your gun, son.

1394
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:12,183
I'm warning you.

1395
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:15,991
One...two...

1396
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,985
Drop your fucking weapon!

1397
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,130
...three.
[gunshot]

1398
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:36,837
Textbooks tell us
that serial killers

1399
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,810
don't have the capacity
to care for others,

1400
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:41,238
to establish
functional relationships.

1401
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:44,314
That's the clinical definition
of a sociopath.

1402
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:49,723
And...that's very hard
for us to comprehend -

1403
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:52,019
that a serial killer
cannot differentiate

1404
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,621
between going into a liquor
store to buy a six pack,

1405
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:58,533
and going into a liquor store
to shoot the clerk in the face.

1406
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:14,343
How's it goin'?

1407
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:17,654
It's going all right.
How are you?

1408
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,116
I'm well.
Thanks for comin' down.

1409
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:20,745
What happened to your eye?

1410
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,820
Oh, some guys were
trying to rape me again.

1411
01:20:22,919 --> 01:20:24,389
They didn't succeed though.

1412
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,917
My asshole's still a virgin.

1413
01:20:30,894 --> 01:20:33,464
So...any thoughts
about the verdict?

1414
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,330
Thoughts about the verdict.

1415
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:39,404
Um...

1416
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,965
Well, I guess I knew
it was inevitable.

1417
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:51,081
I've always thought about
the terminus of my lifestyle.

1418
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,020
Glimpsing my own
mortality is the reason

1419
01:20:53,116 --> 01:20:56,946
I became a serial killer
in the first place.

1420
01:20:57,053 --> 01:21:00,563
So as far as
the verdict goes...

1421
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:03,956
Yeah, I expected it.

1422
01:21:05,929 --> 01:21:07,399
Things fall apart.

1423
01:21:09,933 --> 01:21:11,303
They do.

1424
01:21:22,845 --> 01:21:24,105
Mmm.

1425
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:27,482
Have a bite.

1426
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:29,093
Oh, no.

1427
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,089
It's your last meal.

1428
01:21:32,188 --> 01:21:34,158
Doesn't mean I can't share it.

1429
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:36,434
No, thanks.

1430
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:37,885
Suit yourself.

1431
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:46,641
What?

1432
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,083
It's always somethin'.

1433
01:21:56,179 --> 01:21:59,849
You can't ever just sit down,
can't ever just talk.

1434
01:21:59,949 --> 01:22:01,679
Can't have a fuckin' meal.

1435
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:10,655
It's okay.

1436
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:25,011
I never wanted
to hurt Abigail.

1437
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:28,706
But you did.

1438
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:42,159
I never wanted
to hurt Abigail.

1439
01:22:43,559 --> 01:22:45,529
And I believe you.

1440
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:48,956
I do.

1441
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:06,715
You know, I'm not
a spiritual person,

1442
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:11,985
but I like to think of...

1443
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:15,218
her bein' around
somewhere right now.

1444
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,600
Being lovely.

1445
01:23:21,897 --> 01:23:24,027
God, I loved her.

1446
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,633
You should have met her.

1447
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:32,677
I'd like to think
maybe she'd understand

1448
01:23:32,775 --> 01:23:34,605
why I did what I did.

1449
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:47,824
You know what pisses me off?

1450
01:23:47,923 --> 01:23:49,263
What?

1451
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,228
Every time I read an article
about myself it says

1452
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:53,297
I was a motiveless killer.

1453
01:23:53,396 --> 01:23:56,296
It makes me think they
didn't even get it.

1454
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:57,769
It?

1455
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,566
My message.

1456
01:23:59,668 --> 01:24:00,998
My purpose.

1457
01:24:01,104 --> 01:24:03,244
Which is?

1458
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:06,539
Oh, come on!
You don't know?

1459
01:24:06,642 --> 01:24:09,782
It's not my message
to articulate, Mike.

1460
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:15,623
I simply want to remind people

1461
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:20,158
that this is a beautiful
world that we live in,

1462
01:24:20,256 --> 01:24:25,026
and I want them to
wake up every day...

1463
01:24:25,128 --> 01:24:26,758
and appreciate it.

1464
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:32,944
It's a privilege
to be here, Doc.

1465
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:35,195
And I hope you appreciate it.

1466
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,070
It's a privilege.

1467
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:46,147

["Amazing Grace"
plays on an organ]

1469
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:24,445
[applause]

1470
01:27:03,786 --> 01:27:05,816
(Bart)
He's such an amazing person.

1471
01:27:06,789 --> 01:27:10,189
It's like, most people just
go through life complaining,

1472
01:27:10,293 --> 01:27:14,563
but Mike...
Mike saw through it all.

1473
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:17,333
And he, like, only focused on
what was good about the world.

1474
01:27:17,433 --> 01:27:20,103
And that, that is
such a special thing

1475
01:27:20,202 --> 01:27:21,542
to be able to do, and he did it.

1476
01:27:21,637 --> 01:27:25,907
And I don't, I can honestly
say I don't know anyone

1477
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:28,738
in this entire world who
has the, the joy of life,

1478
01:27:28,844 --> 01:27:30,784
you know, that Mike has.

1479
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:32,679
The joie de vivre.

1480
01:27:35,217 --> 01:27:37,817
All those people
out there saying,

1481
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,720
saying bad things about him.

1482
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:42,893
They don't even know what the
fuck they're talking about.

1483
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:49,200
Mike Wilson saved my life.

1484
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:52,398
And I, I just hope
that I can make

1485
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:56,541
a fraction of the difference
that Mike made, you know?

1486
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:18,564
