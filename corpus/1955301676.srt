If you're gonna show up,

You better start practicing.

Are you ready?
Cue the music.

117
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:34,499
Anyways, so, what up
with you and Donte?

118
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,269
Donte is Donte.
He's disgusting.

119
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,373
But you were just so in
love, like, a week ago.

120
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,309
Yeah.
That was a week ago.

121
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,611
Thoughts change
and people change.

122
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,513
I bought this top a week ago,

123
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,549
and I don't even
like it anymore.

124
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,519
But how have you been feeling?

125
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,088
I got sick in class earlier.

126
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,491
Really?
Yeah, I had to leave.

127
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,593
So... are you
gonna tell him?

128
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,698
I don't know.
Would you?

129
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,967
All he cares about is boxing.

130
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,069
I wouldn't trust guys like that.

131
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,237
What is that supposed to mean?

132
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,541
He's Donte.
He does what he wants.

133
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:20,178
Yeah, but what about
what I want?

134
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,146
Can I use the sink?

135
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,282
Not now.

136
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,451
Bitch.

141
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,744
It's gonna be simple as that.
Plain blue and black.

142
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,081
And then, say, you got your
"Queen City" on the back of that?

143
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,450
It's just gonna say...
It's just gonna say my name.

144
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,852
Mine might just be my initials on mine.
That's it?

145
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,721
It's gonna be like my trunks.

146
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,758
Simple. Feel me? People understand.
Like, they'll know.

147
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
He knows everything.

148
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,497
By the time... By the time we're
about to go out of town,

149
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,834
they should be shipping in, 'cause
them'll take five to eight.

150
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,340
Dang. I didn't even know you was coming.
It's okay.

151
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,342
I seen you up
there dancing, Tiny.

152
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:35,446
- You need to tell your friends to
come turn up with us. - Man, shut up.

153
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:41,519
Lionesses be like,
"I know how it go, man."

154

160
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,639
He better hold that down.

161
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,674
Probably don't even
know what he did.

162
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,210

163
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,912

Yeah.

177

178

Sure.

00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,338
Yeah, but you got the muscles.

183
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,373
Let's give her the flower one.

184
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,649
This good?

185
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,051
I guess.

186
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:05,389
I'm Beezy, by the way. And
that's Maia, Legs' sister.

187
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,029
Should be ready.

188
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,352
Hands go up!

189
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,787
ALL:
Mouths go shut.

190
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,423
We should be
practicing right now.

191
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,425
Y'all want to do
a set of stairs?

192
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,828
ALL: No.

193
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,897
Sorry, Coach. I just... I
need to get some water.

194
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:50,534
COACH: All right. Let's start
with the clap back stand.

195
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,071
GIRL: Let's go!

196
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,913
Everyone spread out.

197
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,482
Face forward.

198
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,719
We're gonna go over stand three.

199
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,655
COACH:
One more week, ladies.

200
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,057
One.

201
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,064
Keep going.

202
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,139
Do it again.
Five, six, seven. Go.

203
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,621
Do it again. Five, six, seven.
Go. Come on, ladies!

204
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,022
One.

205
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:58,002
Do it again.

206
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,504
Five, six, seven. Go.

207
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,906
One.

208
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:16,187
Do it again.
Five, six, seven. Go.

209
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,489
Step. Go harder.

210
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,535
(retching)
(laughing)

211
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,941
Is she okay?

212
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,944
Somebody call 911!

213
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,948
COACH:
Somebody get her water!

214
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,718
(gasping)

215
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,670
I heard from Maia. They're
keeping Legs overnight.

216
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,673
Do they know what happened?
She didn't say.

217
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,677
You got a ride?
Yeah. I got a ride.

218
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,634
(switches clicking)

219
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,043
(girls chattering)

220
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,753
Think she's gonna be back
for competition?

221
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,997
I used to. I'm sure Legs
has that on lockdown.

222
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,232
Don't you think we
should... I can do it.

223
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,368
Legs taught me her stand
routines the other day.

224
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,871
I can handle it, Diamond.
Don't mess!

225
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,774
GIRLS: Lionesses. Watch
me for the new steps.

226
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,211
The count's to eight.
Five, six, seven, eight.

227
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,755
GIRL: April? April!
GIRL #2: I like the blue.

228
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:11,996
Hips?
Thirty-five.

229
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,398
Bust?
Thirty-two.

230
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,967
- Pants?
- Double zero.

231
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,870
Waist?
Twenty-eight.

232
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:23,107
Latonia? Latonia.

233
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,077
Girl, you're straight as a nail.

234
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,113
Waist?
Twenty-three.

235
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,217
Pants?
Twelve.

236
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:36,086
You're so skinny.
Turn around.

237
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,128
Next!

238
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,264
125?
125?

239
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:51,402
I think you're like 132. You're
probably seven pounds over.

240
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:54,138
I was fighting 130.

241
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,284
I gotta lose five pounds
for this weekend.

242
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,853
Let me grab my stuff,
then we can go home.

243
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:16,427
Yeah. She in the hospital.
She was going crazy.

244
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,897
But me and her?
We're through.

245
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:31,041
How's your sister? Good. She just
came back from the hospital.

246
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,745
That was so scary. Karisma's freaking out!
April just texted me!

247
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,114
Come on! Come on!
Let's go see what it is!

248
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,349
(girl screaming)

249
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,225
(screaming continues)

250
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,793
GIRL: Call 911!

251
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,102
Call 911!

252
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,810
(gasping)

253
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,487
(gagging)

254
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,435
MAINE:
You girls crazy.

255
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:10,007
Yeah, but today Karisma had the
same thing happen. And the twins.

256
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,843
Karisma is the crazy one
out of all of them.

257
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,578
Don't start acting like her.

258
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,852
Ew. How can something
even smell that nasty?

259
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:24,354
At least the girls' stuff
never smelled that bad.

260
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,190
Look.

261
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,392
I busted Donte's nose.

262
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:31,295
What?
He's gonna kill you.

263
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,837
(giggling)

264
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,519
So, do you work here?

265
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,222
No. I'm just
helping my brother.

266
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:02,492
Oh. Did you know they didn't
come to school today?

267
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,195
Yeah.
That's pretty crazy.

268
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,898
You gonna stay on the team?

269
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,100
I don't know yet.

270
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:14,404
I think you should. I don't
think they can kick you off.

271
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:18,408
Even if we're really bad?
You're not the worst.

272
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,345
(chuckles)
(clicks tongue)

273
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:34,224
(laughing)
Bah!

274
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,130
(rhythmic clapping)

275
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,136
♪♪ (humming)

276
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:39,676
COACH: We've all been under
a lot of stress lately.

277
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:43,313
Legs and Karisma are both
home and doing much better.

278
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,282
Diamond has a card going around,

279
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:49,152
so make sure y'all sign it in the
locker room before you leave today.

280
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:52,389
I know we have a
competition coming up,

281
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,459
but I've decided it's better for
everyone to take the day off.

282
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,594
(groaning)
I know, I know!

283
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,429
So sorry, ladies.

284
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,565
Practice is canceled for today.

285
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:04,301
Uniforms are in, and we can
pass them out on Friday.

286
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:23,520
(footsteps approaching)

287
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:26,423
Hey, Toni,
don't you live over there?

288
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,393
Yeah. Why?

289
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,529
You gonna walk home?

290
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:35,799
My brother's finishing up the laundry.
I gotta wait for him.

291
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,836
Oh, yeah. I gotta wait
here for Lorraine.

292
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,572
Hey! Can you show me
how to do a pull-up?

293
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:44,708
Sure.

294
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,710
It's really easy.

295
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:48,879
Start with your arms like this.

296
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,651
Make sure you got a good grip.

297
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,521
Use your stomach.
I am!

298
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,489
No, tighter.

299
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,325
Ow.

300
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:06,563
Now, imagine there's a huge rope
pulling you up. Not you, but the rope.

301
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,932
What?

302
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:14,938
Starting your own boxing gym?
Just waiting for you.

303
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,175
If you helped me out, we could
have been out here earlier.

304
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:21,311
Can I wait with Beezy till she gets
picked up? Her ride's running late.

305
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,512
Pretty please?

306
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:27,250
All right. I don't want
you out here by yourself.

307
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,952
Huh.

308
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:31,354
If Mama call, let her know
I'll be cooking dinner.

309
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,689
Call before you leave.

310
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,265
(giggles)

311
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,401
Shh. Shh!
(giggles)

312
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,304
(giggling)
Shh!

313
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,907
(giggles)

314
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,296
(gasps)

315
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,267
It's perfect. (whispers)
Grab a second one.

316
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,706
(clicks tongue)

317
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,609
(giggles)

318
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:29,646
(giggling)

319
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,257
Stop.

320
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,959
(chanting) Pride takes the prey.
Let me hear you say.

321
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,929
Lionesses. Lionesses.
Don't mess. Lionesses.

322
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:49,366
In stride, one pride.
Lionesses. Lionesses.

323
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,901
Pride takes the prey.
Let me hear you say.

324
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,971
Lionesses. Lionesses.
Don't mess. Lionesses.

325
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:58,475
In stride. One pride.
Lionesses. Lionesses.

326
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,977
Take the prey.
Let me hear you say.

327
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:04,814
<i>Lionesses. Lionesses.
Don't mess. Lionesses.</i>

328
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,983
(giggles)

329
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,791
(laughs)

330
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,864
Shh! Do you hear that?

331
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,999
I think someone's in here.

332
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,370
(panting)

333
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,906
Toni! This isn't funny.

334
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:34,744
Toni.

335
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,620
Boo!
(screams)

336
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:47,957
(liquid dribbles)
Ew! Beezy!

337
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,893
Please don't tell.

338
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,367
You think Legs and them
are really okay?

339
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,570
(sniffs)

340
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,074
I don't know.

341
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:05,775
Think it's contagious?

342
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,546
Probably.

343
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,019
Maybe it's some kind of...
boyfriend disease?

344
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,458
(water trickles)

345
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:25,095
I'm fine though.

346
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,396
Yeah.

347
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,800
Me too.

348
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,036
(sighs)
I just want to compete.

349
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:37,974
Yeah. I'm sure
somebody'll figure it out.

350
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,846
(sighs)

351
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,017
You won't tell, right?
I won't.

352
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,021
(uniform clicks in dryer)

353
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:00,997
WOMAN (faint):
To our captains...

354
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:07,103
(indistinct)

355
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:13,643
We are doing everything we can. We think
it may actually be in the water system.

356
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,845
Well, we've been drinking the
water for, like, forever.

357
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:21,684
Well, we'll deal with this and do some
tests and hold a press conference.

358
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,753
What I really want
to know right now is...

359
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,590
Tell me what these episodes
are like for you.

360
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,460
Well, I had mine first and...

361
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:36,599
There's a possibility these episodes have
been caused by unsafe water in the building.

362
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,968
So don't drink
out of the water fountains.

363
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,504
We'll be having a sample
tested soon.

364
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:44,707
So for now, just use
the boxing gym.

365
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:47,677
There's a water cooler
in there that is safe.

366
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,449
Also, since your captains have been sick, we
had to drop out of this weekend's competition.

367
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:53,983
(all groan)

368
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,686
However, however,

369
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:59,989
you can try on your uniforms and
start practicing for the parade.

370
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,591
(scattered clapping)

371
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,693
It's okay? You can
take it from here?

372
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,728
Uniforms.

373
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,865
Five, six, seven, eight.

374
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:12,635
(chattering)

375
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:19,809
- GIRL: What's your name?
- (chattering)

376
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,950
Why won't you let me watch you dance?
Because.

377
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:30,620
Don't you have a boxing tournament?
It's in... two weeks.

378
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,756
Oh. Well,
I'll let you know.

379
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:37,160
(chattering)

380
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,598
Move.

381
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,566
(clicks tongue)
So you with them now?

382
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,838
(groans)
Yeah.

383
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,940
Five, six... Let's get
back to practice, ladies.

384
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:57,747
You was all, like, boom.
And boom. (chuckles)

385
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,582
Let's practice parade.

386
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,284
We can practice right here.
Okay.

387
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:06,155
Five, six... Five, six, seven.

388
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:11,761
Maia.
(chuckles)

389
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:16,866
Stay on beat. Five, six...
Five, six, seven, eight.

390
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,874
Toni, this is parade.
You have to smile.

391
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:29,546
(grunts) Five, six...
Five, six, seven.

392
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:39,622
(chattering on TV)

393
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:45,695
MAN: <i>You know, there's something
awfully screwy about this.</i>

394
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:49,165
<i>Or my name isn't Larimore!</i>

395
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,034
(continues, indistinct)

396
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:57,073
(ice clatters) ELMER FUDD:<i> Sorry
I had to plug you, Mr. Duck.</i>

397
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:01,578
<i>But I'm a sportsman. A great,
great sportsman.</i> (chuckles)

398
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,212
You're growing up fast,
lil' Legs.

399
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,056
Where'd you get those?
From a friend.

400
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:15,024
You gonna do this or what?

401
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:19,062
How long do I have to hold the ice on for?
Till it feels numb.

402
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:20,597
I think it's okay.
(flicks lighter)

403
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,632
Okay.

404
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,643
This was your idea.
(whimpers)

405
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:46,756
(grunts)

406
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,095
Toni, you're crazy. I can't
believe you didn't scream.

407
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:58,835
Here you go.

408
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,647
Do I put them in now?

409
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,750
(exhales)

410
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:18,955
(inhales)

411
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:27,430
I don't... think
I can do the other one.

412
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:29,365
I can do it.

413
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,007
Ready?
(inhales)

414
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:46,375
(door opens)
(exhales)

415
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,979
MAINE:
You ready? Come on.

416
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:57,453
How the girls doing?
Fine.

417
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:00,022
Fine?
That's it?

418
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:09,499
Aw, Mama gonna kill me. Where
you get some money from?

419
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:14,103
I did it myself.
Give 'em to me. Now.

420
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:16,305
They're mine.

421
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,241
You know what?

422
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:23,846
You're on your own when we go home.
You're on your own.

423
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,884
(sighs)

424
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,909
Are you sure you did it right?
Yes.

425
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,877
Boom.
Are you positive, Beezy?

426
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:57,079
I'm positive.
I bet you were cryin'.

427
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:00,383
No, she didn't even scream.
I did.

428
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:03,119
You screamed?
But it wasn't you.

429
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:04,854
Yeah, but it was scary.

430
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,126
(chattering)
(chuckles)

431
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:13,429
Oh, I got moves.
Let's go.

432
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,364
I want to see this.
I want to see this.

433
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,000
BEEZY: They're cute.
GIRL: Thank you.

434
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,535
Are they real?

435
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,208
Get back. What!

436
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,211
GIRLS: Ooh!

437
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:30,246
GIRL: Turn, turn.

438
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:33,149
YOUNG GIRL: You do it.
Dance, Ley Ley.

439
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:34,884
(cheering)

440
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:37,386
Hot Sauce. Come on, girl.
You can do better.

441
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:40,323
Shake! Put the peanut
butter on that butter.

442
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:54,237
REPORTER:
<i>seizure-like symptoms.</i>

443
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,539
<i>Some of the girls have even
been hospitalized.</i>

444
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,942
<i>But health officials have
yet to release a diagnosis.</i>

445
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:04,080
<i>West End residents fear the illness
may be caused by contaminated water.</i>

446
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:08,084
<i>City officials say they are working with the
county health department to investigate.</i>

447
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:12,288
<i>In the meantime, the community center is
only using bottled water for drinking.</i>

448
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,524
<i>That's an attempt to curb what
residents are calling "the fits."</i>

449
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,059
<i>We'll keep an eye on the story.</i>

450
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:20,630
Come on! Faster!

451
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:22,999
(chuckles)

452
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:25,568
Faster. Faster.

453
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,907
Faster. Faster.
Faster. Faster.

454
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:37,013
(girls talking, indistinct) Faster.
Faster. Faster. Faster.

455
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:43,319
KARISMA: Channel 12 keeps calling
to see if I'll do an interview.

456
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:47,223
DIAMOND: They didn't call me.
LEGS: It doesn't matter.

457
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,525
We're not gonna be interrogated
on live television. Psst!

458
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,494
DIAMOND: They don't believe us.

459
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,630
LEGS:
Let 'em think what they want.

460
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,300
Hey, K, are you still shaking?

461
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:59,302
Sometimes when I wake up.

462
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:02,004
DIAMOND: So what was it like?
GIRL: Yeah, how did it feel?

463
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,940
Come on!
Shh!

464
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:06,008
Actually, it's kind of
like competition.

465
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,477
When you're really nervous
right before the performance,

466
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,514
and you kinda
forget the choreography?

467
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:14,483
I mean, well,
your body knows it, but...

468
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:18,187
I don't know. It's like you
almost just stop thinking.

469
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:22,291
It's like time stops,
and you're just floating.

470
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:25,094
(continues, indistinct)

471
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:27,163
(screams)

472
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,301
(door closes)

473
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:35,405
Other hand.

474
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:40,977
We were all just in the locker
room, and Madison went crazy.

475
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,046
What do you mean, crazy?

476
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:46,749
She started shaking
all over the place.

477
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,052
Was the whole team there?
Pretty much.

478
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:52,221
You guys talkin' about Madison?

479
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:54,590
It was crazy.
She was like... (grunts)

480
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:57,727
And her eyes was like...

481
00:49:57,729 --> 00:50:00,229
And then her tongue was like...

482
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,698
She dropped to the floor,
was shakin' a lot.

483
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:07,136
Shaking. Shaking.
She twisted for a little time.

484
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:10,373
Twist. She got like that
and then like that.

485
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:11,774
And then, zombie.

486
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:14,744
She was, like, choking
and a zombie so she was like,

487
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,178
bleh-bleh, bleh-bleh.

488
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,682
Blah, blah-blah. (chokes) Choking.
(giggles)

489
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:24,053
And then she was doing it again.
Spinning around.

490
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:27,156
It was live.
Everyone's getting sick.

491
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:29,025
Pretty much all the older girls.

492
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,460
Maia, can you do mine?

493
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,396
Yeah.
Give me your hand.

494
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,273
He's filling up a container!

495
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,221
They look like astronauts!

496
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,102
(gasps)

497
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:20,643
(gasping)
I can't breathe.

498
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:26,682
LEGS: Is that Kira?
KARISMA: She's in the kitchen!

499
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:29,085
(gasping)

500
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,588
Shh. Shh.

501
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,658
Breathe in. Breathe out. Are
you just gonna stand there?

502
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,661
It'll be okay. Breathe in. Breathe out.
(gasping) Okay.

503
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,629
(stick rattles)

504
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,696
Hey.
Hey.

505
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:49,465
You okay?

506
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:52,368
Just thinking about everything.
Yeah.

507
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:54,937
Are you nervous?

508
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,572
About the parade?

509
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,474
You know it's gonna
happen to us.

510
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:01,210
Just thinking about what
my sister said, you know?

511
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:02,778
What do you mean?

512
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,548
I just... I just want
to know how it feels.

513
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,816
Aren't you scared?

514
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:11,387
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
It'll happen to us anyway.

515
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,357
It hasn't happened
to any of the boys.

516
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,526
Yeah, but we're not them.

517
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,928
LEGS: Maia!

518
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,465
Coming!
See ya.

519
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,965
(ball bouncing)

520
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:04,573
(vacuum whirring)

521
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:13,616
(whirring stops)

522
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:21,824
MAINE: You know I just got done vacuuming.
What's up with you these days?

523
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:26,662
(sighs)
(sighs)

524
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:33,335
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

525
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:40,276
COACH: All right! Lookin'
good, ladies. (sighs)

526
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:42,978
(chattering)

527

(all gasp)

530
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,052
Maia.

531
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:26,488
Maia. Maia.

532
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:29,058
Maia. Maia.

533
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:36,865
Do you think we should
go see if Maia's okay?

534
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,568
I don't care. What do you
mean, you don't care?

535
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,503
Maia wanted it to happen to her.

536
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,073
Huh?

537
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:47,609
I don't want it to happen to me.

538
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:50,379
- You've been drinking the water.
- You still think it's that?

539
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:52,881
What do you know about it?

540
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:55,384
What do you know about anything?

541
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,355
I'll tell Maia you said hi.

542
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:13,502
What are you trying to do?
Break your wrist?

543
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,472
What do you care?

544
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:20,542
Dang, dancing must've
really got you weak.

545
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,010
Girl...

546
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:24,713
Dang. Hold up.

547
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:29,885
Come on now, Tone. What's wrong?
(sighs)

548
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,021
I'm scared.

549
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,625
Scared?

550
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:39,595
Scared of what?
It's all in your mind.

551
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:44,066
Trust me.
They gonna get better.

552
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:29,611

553
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:35,083

555
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:29,271
COACH: Everyone! Please! Ladies!

556
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,711
WOMAN: Which is why I'll be talking
with your daughters today,

557
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:37,980
discussing what's happening
in their lives,

558
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:41,049
trying to see if there's any warning
signs that may have caused all this.

559
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,784
Any patterns.

560
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:45,954
Like I said, I'm still
doing my degree.

561
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,990
WOMAN (shouting):
Is it the water or not?

562
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:51,894
WOMAN #2: I did read the report
that came from the city.

563
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:55,898
There is nothing wrong with the water
in this building. It is safe to drink.

564
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,600
(chattering) YOUNG GIRL:
Have you gotten sick yet?

565
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,069
No.

566
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:05,674
(chattering)

567
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:07,276
BEEZY:
Where are your earrings?

568
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:10,679
They were infected.

569
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,985
(chattering)

570
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:22,057
Last time I came on my period...

571
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,694
Bianca?

572
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:28,997
Your turn. GIRL: I don't want
to talk to her about that.

573
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:01,229
(inaudible)

574
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,311
WOMAN (shouts):
Help! Help! Help!

575
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,347
Somebody help, please!

576
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:24,820
(grunting)

577
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,792
You think it'll happen again?

578
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:34,363
I don't know why everyone's making
such a big deal out of it. I'm fine.

579
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:37,766
It was crazy though. It was
like watching it from above,

580
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:39,901
like I had two sets of eyes.

581
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:41,370
Was yours like that, Maia?

582
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:44,373
No. Mine was,
like, serene.

583
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:46,408
What's that mean?
Peaceful.

584
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:50,078
It didn't look peaceful. It looked scary.
Did mine look scary?

585
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,813
I didn't see.

586
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:56,251
WOMAN: Bianca?
That's me.

587
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,720
Your foster mom gave me a call.
How you feelin'?

588
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,690
She's feeling better.

589
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:04,259
That's good. You think you
can get yourself to the car?

590
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:09,064
You're good.

591
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,800
Feeling better, Beez? What
do you know about it?

592
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:20,008
(car door opens, closes)

593

GIRL: Mine? It was... (imitates
popping) Like pop rocks.

598
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:15,831
Really? Mine was terrifying. Like I
never want to go through that again.

599
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,332
Mine must've
happened in my room.

600
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:20,102
My mom came in, my teddy
bears were everywhere.

601
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:21,803
(laughs) Wait. Did
y'all see Legs?

602
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:24,906
She was still twitching at the meeting.

This hand.

607

Step back.

608
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:35,877
