1
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:44,339
Did you remember
your notebooks today?

2
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,569
Nobody?

3
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,514
I remembered!

4
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,981
Okay, so today we'll be
talking about fertilization.

5
00:00:56,122 --> 00:01:02,652
Well, fertilization is the moment
in which the sperm,

6
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,856
and there are many of them--

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,664
Here are sperm that swim
towards the female egg.

8
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,396
Jessica, did you bring
your workbook?

9
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,336
Yes.

10
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,503
Good, at least you have that.

11
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,445
Once again, my class is interrupted!

12
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:28,145
Girls, please study this chapter
because you still don't know

13
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,755
what the female egg is.

14
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:34,019
And also don't forget that
next week we have an exam.

15
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:53,973
Jessica!

16
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,008
Are you coming
to my sweet fifteen tonight?

17
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,412
Of course!

18
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,714
My mom didn't have money,
for hair and makeup.

19
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:06,519
Don't worry, my mom
used to work at a salon.

20
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,990
I'll help you with all that.

21
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,925
What if she forgets the cake?

22
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,394
Don't worry about those things.

23
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,558
Can you imagine?
I'm so nervous, I'm sweating!

24
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,066
Don't be nervous.

25
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,933
Jessica, my father
is going to give the speech

26
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,870
and you know he loves speeches!

27
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,604
He'll go on forever
and embarrass me.

28
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:30,307
Your main concern
should be looking beautiful!

29
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,112
I'm so nervous!

30
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,051
-Did you invite all the cool guys?
-Of course!

31
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,247
Can I talk to you, Jessica?

32
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,188
Sure.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,123
Don't be mean!

34
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,603
What did you want to talk about?

35
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,710
Never mind.

36
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,540
Josue, you have to come
to my party tonight!

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,738
Can I see?

38
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,677
I have to go.
My dad will be mad if I'm late.

39
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,280
Could you come early?

40
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,290
Otherwise, no makeup, no party!

41
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,984
I'll be early, six o'clock.

42
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,595
Bye.

43
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,822
Watch out, you fucking cow!

44
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,727
This isn't a barnyard!

45
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,190
Get the fuck off the car!

46
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,327
Get off the hood, you little shit!

47
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,865
Just drive off!

48
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,198
I'm still waiting for my food.

49
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,698
Hi, dad.

50
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,630
You're late!

51
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,275
The bus was delayed.

52
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,604
Don't talk back!

53
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,679
Go help your mother so we can eat.

54
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,304
-Let me change first.
-You're fine. Hurry up!

55
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,285
Hi, dad.

56
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,620
You finally showed up?

57
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,119
Sorry, I got caught up at work.

58
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,666
So you're the only one that works?

59
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,833
Damn, this fucking salt.

60
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,236
Did you say hello to your mother?

61
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,705
She misses you.

62
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,076
It's been a while
since you stopped by.

63
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,342
Hello, mom.

64
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,054
Kiss you later, okay?

65
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,047
Since when do you care about mom?

66
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,591
What do you mean, "since when"?

67
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,786
You're the one who should care.

68
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,489
She's always asking for you!

69
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,362
You know you're her favorite.

70
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,338
I'm worried about your sister.

71
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,648
Where the hell is my food?

72
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,581
Hello, Jessica.

73
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,380
Hello, Marco.

74
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,821
Why are you always stressed?

75
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,163
So many problems!

76
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,563
I know things are difficult but....

77
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,794
I haven't gotten paid yet.

78
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,835
And on top of that, this food!

79
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,075
Stop pacing and sit down!

80
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,330
Hey, Jessica.

81
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,668
What?

82
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,177
I heard that people saw you
hanging out with Stella.

83
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,640
Did you see me?

84
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,212
You don't even live here.
How would you know?

85
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,981
What did you say?

86
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,125
-She's hanging out with Stella.
-Who is Stella?

87
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,255
-Mind your business--
-Shut the fuck up!

88
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,391
She's friends
with a co-worker of mine.

89
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,728
She's a slut.

90
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:02,833
I don't want you
hanging around with sluts!

91
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,705
I don't want you seeing boys yet.

92
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,338
Get back over there!

93
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,881
Why the fuck are you over here?

94
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,678
Easy, dad!

95
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,849
You'll get an ulcer.

96
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:20,390
You have no idea what I'll do
if you end up pregnant!

97
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,158
I'll kill you!

98
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,693
Easy, dad.

99
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,560
You're pretty!

100
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,966
You're not made for scum!

101
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,572
Are you listening to me?

102
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,798
Look at me!

103
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,711
You're better than that!

104
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:44,077
I don't want you mingling
with kids from our neighborhood!

105
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,444
You can do much better.

106
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,488
You have to study.
Be a professional!

107
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,614
Not like us!

108
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,354
Get over here!

109
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,899
And get that lipstick off your snout!

110
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,330
That's how they all start.

111
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,732
First lipstick,

112
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,931
then they're jumping on every guy!

113
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,974
Wait, Jessica.
This is for your own good!

114
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,273
I told you I'd be here.

115
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,142
But you're late!
Look at the time.

116
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:56,906
I'm here, aren't l?

117
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,983
These two also came late.

118
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,111
We've been here a long time.
You're just nervous.

119
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,622
This is how I'm going
to do your hair.

120
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,857
Do you like it?

121
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,755
-Yes?
-Yes, yes, yes!

122
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,830
I'll put some makeup on you too.

123
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,891
Later can you do my hair too?

124
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,401
Sure, if you help me with mine.

125
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,970
Hurry up!

126
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,597
The party's starting soon!

127
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,042
Ouch! Bitch, that hurt!

128
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:31,975
-lsabel, did you invite the seniors?
-Yes, the whole school is coming.

129
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,669
That's going to look so pretty.

130
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,670
Don't be nervous!

131
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,473
You'll be the prettiest one tonight.

132
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,745
Jessica, don't forget
you have to do my hair.

133
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,448
But I'm fixing your hair.

134
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,556
Well, you can brush my hair,
and she'll do the bun.

135
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,955
Isabel, you look so beautiful!

136
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,493
Really?

137
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,358
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise for the guest of honor.

138
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:28,064
Put your hands together
for our brand new debutante,

139
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,471
Isabel Lopez Villarroel!

140
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,173
Along with her proud father,
Mr. Pedro Lopez Burgos.

141
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,416
Now she joins her friends,

142
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,822
and classmates.

143
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:54,764
Today a dream comes true
for lsabel, her family and friends.

144
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,834
Thank you very much.

145
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:05,808
I want to thank my family

146
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:10,746
and the friends of my little lsabel

147
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:16,446
for coming here tonight
to celebrate her sweet fifteen.

148
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:22,487
I want to thank you all for coming
to my humble home.

149
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,290
And above all,

150
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:32,337
I want to thank my sister-in-law,
Asuntita, for donating the cake.

151
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,635
My brother Pepe Lucho,

152
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,744
for donating the rings,

153
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,678
and for lending me the tables
and chairs from his diner.

154
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,514
I can't let this opportunity pass
without thanking my dear wife

155
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,524
for her devotion
and the decorations.

156
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,357
And I'd like to ask you all
to applaud,

157
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:02,695
for today my daughter,

158
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,699
becomes a woman.

159
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,620
A dream comes true
for our brand new debutante.

160
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,589
Congratulations, lsabel!

161
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:34,427
On behalf of your friends and family

162
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,098
who love and appreciate you

163
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,729
we wish you a happy birthday.

164
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,614
And now I would like to invite

165
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,216
all of lsabel's friends

166
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:59,320
to join her on the dance floor.

167
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,335
Good evening, ladies.
Thank you for coming.

168
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,375
Let's go get them, guys.

169
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,172
Easy! Easy!

170
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,874
Get your fishing poles ready!

171
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,086
You guys are fucked,
I already found mine.

172
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,453
Okay, let's see.
We don't need you anyway.

173
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,796
No.

174
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,829
I won't do anything.
It's just to get to know each other.

175
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,344
Come sit next to me.

176
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,746
Come on.

177
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,113
Don't be afraid.

178
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,387
What's wrong, baby?

179
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,658
Don't be afraid of me.

180
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,104
Are you scared?

181
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,832
It's nothing, just relax.

182
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,643
What's wrong?

183
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,809
Don't you like me?

184
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,386
I like you a lot.

185
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:29,767
Don't be afraid, baby.
Nothing's going to happen.

186
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,405
We've been waiting for your cousin
for 20 minutes.

187
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,668
-Wait, he'll be here soon.
-We cut class for nothing!

188
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,541
-It's worth it. My cousin's cool.
-Oh, my cousin, my cousin!

189
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,749
-Don't be a jerk.
-Then stop kissing his ass!

190
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,977
You brag about him so much.

191
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,712
-Who does he look like?
-I know all your family.

192
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,049
Because if he looks like you....

193
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,949
Come on, all your friends
are crazy for me!

194
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,652
Don't pretend you don't know.

195
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,594
They've arrived.
Keep your eyes open.

196
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,994
You sure you'll recognize him?

197
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,260
It's been 12 years!

198
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,773
Excuse me, are any of you Fabian?

199
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,399
That's me.

200
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:58,078
-Finally! Good to see you.
-How have you been?

201
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,205
Hi, I'm Sebastian.

202
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,012
What's up, Sebastian?

203
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,450
Don't break him!

204
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,817
So, you're the famous
Colombian guy!

205
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,260
You're just like your cousin
described you.

206
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,295
This is Joaquin and Camila.

207
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,796
Look at him!

208
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,797
-So, where is my aunt?
-She's at home.

209
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,462
Let's go, guys!

210
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,870
Easy! I'll take care of it.

211
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,001
Easy, dude. Easy!

212
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,631
Okay, cousin. This is it.

213
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,131
You're here!

214
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,329
This is not Bogotá.

215
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,997
Colombian boy,
this is where life begins!

216
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,699
You'll drink, you'll meet women....

217
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,869
You're in the best city in the world.

218
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,947
You have no idea
what you're in for.

219
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,516
Here in Santa Cruz,
there's places to go and shit to do.

220
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,914
Whenever you want!

221
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,112
Forever!

222
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,280
What do you guys do here?

223
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,858
Everything.
We hang out every day.

224
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,153
Your name's Joaquin, right?

225
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,022
What's that over there?

226
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:23,196
Those are like ornaments
for dumb tourists.

227
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:27,236
No, cousin. The carriage
symbolizes the culture....

228
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,771
Shut the fuck up!

229
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,569
Santa Cruz is all about fun,
alcohol, and women!

230
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,540
You don't need to know
all that other shit!

231
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,976
You guys drink already?

232
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,275
Check this move out!

233
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,978
It's a traditional motion with us.

234
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,521
It's mechanical.
Your arm does it naturally.

235
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,421
So, you're up for a good time?

236
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,056
Yeah, but don't worry, guys.
I don't really go out much in Bogotá.

237
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,325
Why not?

238
00:23:55,467 --> 00:24:00,404
Because it's dangerous,
and my mom doesn't let me.

239
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,730
Oh, mommy wouldn't let him!

240
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,376
Here you have no mommy.
This is not Bogotá.

241
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,102
Here it's dangerous not to go out.

242
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,906
Cousin, you're here with me now.

243
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:13,313
We have wheels. It's drinking time.

244
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,377
How old are you?

245
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,714
Fifteen.

246
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,220
Dude, he's fifteen!

247
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,722
Yeah, with the body
of a 12-year-old.

248
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,623
How many chicks you have?

249
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,592
What's that?

250
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:29,632
Chicks, girls, pussy, bitches!

251
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,700
Oh, I have one girlfriend.

252
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,732
-Oh, he has one girlfriend.
-Just one?

253
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:43,239
If you keep talking like that here,
you'll get one beating!

254
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,576
I have an idea for us
to warm up our engines.

255
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,213
How about some brewskies?

256
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,049
Yeah, dude!

257
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:55,057
Stop by Don Lucho. He'll give us
a good deal. He knows us.

258
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,558
Listen to her, she's a regular!

259
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,526
Let's stop by the liquor store.

260
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,464
Get the fuck off, dude!

261
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,796
I just washed it!

262
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,493
Get the fuck off the car!

263
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,265
-You little shit!
-Just drive off!

264
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,404
Fuck you!

265
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,875
And they leave it even dirtier!

266
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,537
I just washed it!

267
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,876
He probably scratched the hood!

268
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,147
Look who's there, Dante!

269
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,718
He's our friend.

270
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:28,923
Jump in, faggot.

271
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,493
What's up?

272
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,161
The life of the party is here!

273
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,163
So you're the life
of the party, huh?

274
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,767
Yes, and you know it.

275
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:37,902
Give me a cigarette.

276
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,204
This is my cousin
from Colombia, smell!

277
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,868
Smell?

278
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,804
You farted, motherfucker!

279
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,471
No, I mean he smells like coffee!

280
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:56,383
-What were you doing by yourself?
-I was going home.

281
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,751
Why didn't you skip class with us?

282
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,789
You motherfuckers didn't tell me!

283
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,419
Don't worry,
we've got plans for tonight.

284
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,555
Can we go home soon?

285
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,463
No, dude,
we're going to Burger King.

286
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,306
We'll go around another time,
so people notice us.

287
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,499
You say hi to everyone
and pretend you know them.

288
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,506
You know what?

289
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,441
He's a foreigner,
so he'll get all the chicks.

290
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,274
I want a woman! I'm horny!

291
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,905
Bitches! Here I come!

292
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,074
I'm all yours!

293
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,894
Get the fuck off me, dude!

294
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,004
Stop goofing around!

295
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,107
-People are looking.
-Oh, he doesn't want to be seen!

296
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,368
Look! The life of the party
humps everybody!

297
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,137
Fucking faggot!

298
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,682
Why don't you guys
get a room already?

299
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,261
I don't understand why you keep
standing sideways.

300
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,993
Stop teasing him.

301
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,139
-Don't pay attention.
-He's an idiot!

302
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,541
-I'm going to kick your ass!
-They'll start fighting again.

303
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,045
-I'm sorry, grumpy!
-Let's introduce him to girls.

304
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,479
So what chick do you like?

305
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,852
Just tell us which one
you want to fuck.

306
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,722
Yeah, just choose!

307
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,694
What about the blonde down there?

308
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,863
Oh, man, the blonde!

309
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,762
We ask him to choose,
and he chooses the best one.

310
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,802
-Don't even look at her.
-You know what, bro?

311
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,996
You've got no chance
in hell with that one.

312
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,470
They're both too snotty!

313
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,577
Her boyfriend is an asshole!
Error.

314
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,338
-He's rich, and he'll kick your ass.
-He's popular and shit.

315
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,680
-So what? He's with us.
-And you're Mr. Macho Man?

316
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,984
Check her out, guys.

317
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:19,991
-She's dead.
-I love this fucking song.

318
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,971
-Where are you coming from?
-School and you?

319
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:31,201
We came from school,
can't you tell?

320
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,573
I'm with a couple of friends,
and this guy from Colombia.

321
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,773
You want to meet them?

322
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,147
Sorry, girl, you know Choco.
If he sees me, he'll kill me.

323
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,050
-Some other time.
-Okay, bye.

324
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:54,126
Bottom's up, bottom's down,
cheers to the fucking Colombian!

325
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,599
You have to finish it straight.

326
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:05,901
Come on, man!

327
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,409
Come on!

328
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,879
Oh, man, he's drunk already!

329
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,450
Okay, let's get more!

330
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,850
Hold on, I'm going to buy cigarettes.

331
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:20,583
So, listen, this is the best club
in Santa Cruz, MAD.

332
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:24,525
I call it the cemetery, because
I always bury my thing here.

333
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,365
And do they let you in?

334
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,969
Don't worry, our friend Chichito
will hook us up.

335
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,129
He's fucking loaded!

336
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:38,104
The good thing about MAD
is that older women come here,

337
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,177
and the older, the easier.

338
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,041
Speak of the devil!

339
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,547
This is Chichito. Motherfucker.

340
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,311
Look what he brought!

341
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,921
Fucking show off.

342
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,851
-Dude, what a car!
-And it's brand new.

343
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,360
His father bought it for him
three days ago.

344
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,527
The motherfucker doesn't know
what to do with his money.

345
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,394
-When I make a promise, I keep it.
-What's up, dude?

346
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:11,572
-All right, guys, no excuses.
-Let's drink like there's no tomorrow!

347
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,176
Okay, let's go to MAD.

348
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,368
What do you mean, "MAD"?

349
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,776
Why don't we go slumming instead?

350
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,373
You told us you were going
get us into MAD.

351
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,112
There's a sweet fifteen we can
crash. What's "slumming"?

352
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:27,452
It's like hooking up
with easy girls from the slums.

353
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,352
You make out?

354
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,655
Of course!

355
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,697
You promised me
we were going to go to MAD.

356
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,232
No, fuck that, let's go slumming.

357
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,265
You guys are fucking horny
all the time.

358
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,002
Fabian, you're not going
to leave me, right?

359
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,875
You have my cell number.

360
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,879
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

361
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:56,314
Don't worry. Dante, you're in charge.

362
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,651
Fabian, how am I getting home?

363
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,783
Fabian, please!

364
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,487
We're coming back, don't worry.

365
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,894
Fabian, listen!

366
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,590
Your cousin is a son of a bitch!

367
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:10,701
-Fabian, please!
-Cousin, don't you worry!

368
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,598
Fabian, you said we were
going to go to MAD!

369
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,238
We came together,
we leave together!

370
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,865
Don't be a hypocrite!
Please, Fabian!

371
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,745
Let's go in, fuck it!

372
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,213
But how am I going to get home?

373
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,944
Who cares?
We'll take a cab or something.

374
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,466
What's up with that face, dude?

375
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,569
Cheer the fuck up!

376
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,369
Man, Santa Cruz
is fucking awesome!

377
00:32:56,507 --> 00:33:02,673
Did you see how in two seconds l
had my snake surrounded by pussy?

378
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,445
Did you have a good time?

379
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,556
Yeah, but how are we
getting home?

380
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,424
I have no clue, bro!

381
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,963
If they don't show up soon, we'll
have to walk, because I'm broke.

382
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,498
Do you know
where my cousin lives?

383
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,828
Of course, dude! He's my buddy.

384
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,439
These motherfuckers are going
to fucking hear me now!

385
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:32,269
This is the last time
I go out with them.

386
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,208
You know your cousin
is a fucking hypocrite!

387
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,311
What's up, yo?

388
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,275
Asshole! He thinks he's all that
because he has a car.

389
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,218
What were you saying?

390
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:50,692
As I said, I don't go out much,
but this was groovy.

391
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,764
Groovy, groovy!

392
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,834
Look, there they are
by themselves. Losers!

393
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,869
Those fuckers are here.

394
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,974
What's up, faggots? Jump in.

395
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,437
Did you see these two losers,
by themselves?

396
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,241
I bet they didn't even get in.

397
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,512
We did get in, and I bet you
we had a better time than you!

398
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,350
You think we can't get in
without you?

399
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,389
We did get in and we had a blast.

400
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:25,758
Where's my cousin?
Where's Fabian?

401
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,626
You got to hear about your cousin.

402
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,494
I was fucking this girl

403
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:33,092
when I realized
Fabian is kissing some girl,

404
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:38,504
and he was like, "l love you, I want
to marry you, I'll protect you.

405
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:44,343
I'll take care of you
and your family."

406
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,653
He was so crazy about her
that I had to lend him my car.

407
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,256
And you know how hard it is for me
to give away my car.

408
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,722
He was begging me!

409
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:59,592
All right, so he stayed.
Can you guys take me home now?

410
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:05,430
We'll take you home eventually,
but not now. No fucking way!

411
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,298
The night is just starting!

412
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:12,239
When the sun comes out,
maybe we'll take you home.

413
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,638
I have a little surprise for you.

414
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,639
Check this out!

415
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,281
I bet you this was Joaquin's idea.

416
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:18,973
Of course!

417
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,210
Fucking A!

418
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,713
What are you going to do
with those eggs?

419
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:30,761
-You'll see. You're in for a treat.
-Put this shit back, this stinks.

420
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,126
You're going to love it.

421
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,257
This is the only place on the planet
where you can do this.

422
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,232
What are you going to do?

423
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,371
You'll see.

424
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,198
Sebastian,
you haven't seen fun yet.

425
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,812
-We'll show you.
-This is an orgasm, bro!

426
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,472
-It's nothing less.
-At least take one.

427
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:55,745
Trust me, you'll love it!

428
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,980
-What do I do?
-You just do as we do.

429
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:03,150
-Come on, guys.
-Let's control ourselves.

430
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,596
-I'm not throwing any.
-At least one.

431
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,228
Come on, dude! Don't be a faggot!
No, seriously.

432
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,699
Go fast, because these
motherfuckers have stones.

433
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,895
Just one, Sebastian.

434
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:15,936
Here we come.

435
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,133
Get ready. Throw one. Do it!

436
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,105
I'm not doing it!

437
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:25,109
-You fucking cocksuckers!
-Take these up your ass!

438
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,615
-Fucking faggots, you should learn!
-Cumsuckers!

439
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,016
-Motherfuckers! Assholes!
-Fucking dick lovers!

440
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:33,817
-ldiots! Assholes!
-Ass lickers! Fucking faggots!

441
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,252
Motherfucker!

442
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,163
Why did you throw it like that?
You should have thrown harder!

443
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:47,270
You wasted the eggs!
You ruined the fun!

444
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,495
No, but....

445
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:54,236
But what? We have to get rid
of those motherfuckers.

446
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,107
Goddamn people!

447
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,740
They shouldn't be allowed
to be there.

448
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,249
I want to go home.

449
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,552
Oh, he's scared!

450
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,553
I bet you haven't been
deflowered yet!

451
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,123
-What?
-You haven't been deflowered yet!

452
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,885
-What's that?
-Virgin!

453
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,426
He's even afraid of faggots!

454
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,689
-No, I'm not a virgin.
-What did you say?

455
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,128
I'm not a virgin.

456
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,699
Then what are you laughing at?

457
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,357
He's a virgin.

458
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,731
If you're not a virgin,
then let's go get some pussy!

459
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,068
Let's go. He's a virgin.

460
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:24,970
He's lying.

461
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,577
-Okay, I'll buy you a hooker.
-Fucking A!

462
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,975
Just him though.
You already got laid.

463
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,606
Whatever. I don't give a fuck.
My dick is dead now.

464
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:41,953
-Seriously, guys!
-Today you'll get broken in!

465
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,358
You're going to fuck and
try the taste of Bolivian pussy!

466
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:49,364
-Chichito, please don't go.
-Your jerking off days are over!

467
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,960
-You're an old man now.
-You can fuck and fuck and fuck.

468
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:58,472
-But I don't want to.
-Hurry up, dude!

469
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,372
Okay, all set.
I got you the best one.

470
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:06,506
-You paid her already?
-Yeah, it's all set.

471
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:12,419
-Just stick your little dick in!
-Hurry up! She's waiting.

472
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,114
Guys, don't do this to me.

473
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:19,491
-Don't be a faggot! She's waiting.
-Just fuck her!

474
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,324
Dante! Please....

475
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,830
Go in, or I'll fucking
throw a stone at you!

476
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,696
-You're going to become a man.
-Enjoy it!

477
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,804
What's your name?

478
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,708
Sebastian.

479
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,642
And you?

480
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,275
Clemencia.

481
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,419
-Okay, Choco. What do you think?
-Good, right?

482
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,320
Now you're ready to go
to the United States?

483
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:49,798
-I can't wait.
-I can imagine.

484
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,663
How long are you staying
over there?

485
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:55,293
I'm staying until summer.
I'll be back in June or July.

486
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:59,238
-What are you studying?
-Civil engineering.

487
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,812
I wish you all the best, my friend.

488
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,814
I don't forget old friends.
I'll bring you back a hot "gringa"!

489
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,853
Great! Thank you!
I wish you the best. Bye.

490
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,917
Hi, my love,
How are you?

491
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,991
Yeah, yeah,
I just got out of school,

492
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,892
Yeah, I'm on the street,

493
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:58,558
We're going to cruise around
and then we'll go to Burger King,

494
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,567
No, a little longer,

495
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,134
Fine. Okay.

496
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,139
Hey, don't forget to buy
the newspaper.

497
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,708
You came out really handsome!

498
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,938
Okay, honey. I love you. Bye.

499
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,748
-Hurry, we only have 1 0 minutes!
-Okay, we'll fly.

500
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,310
So, what are we doing tonight?

501
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,117
I have the fashion show tonight.

502
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,792
Choco's going to kill me.
I haven't told him about it yet.

503
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,786
Oh, fuck it!
I can't just not tell him!

504
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:31,264
-Chill out! He ain't your husband.
-He will be my husband.

505
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,426
Guess what? He proposed!

506
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,572
How cute!

507
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,640
So you're getting married now?

508
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,140
What an idiot!

509
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,244
You really believe that?

510
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:42,970
What do you mean by that?

511
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:46,480
Girl, it's been a year and a half.

512
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,914
Anyway, what are you
wearing tonight?

513
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,111
Look at her!
Isn't that Choco's cousin?

514
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,348
She's not. Don't be an ass!
Shit! You're mean!

515
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,018
Check out her outfit!
Oh, and those sandals!

516
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:02,223
Not even my maid would wear
those sandals! Please!

517
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,665
Oh, my God!
I feel sorry for her.

518
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,430
She's so clueless!

519
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,233
Look at the one sitting there.
Look at her!

520
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,208
You missed her.

521
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,311
Look at her watching us!

522
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:21,043
-Okay, girl, let's cruise the scene!
-Forget about Choco.

523
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,421
Shades up or down?

524
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,558
-You're going to look, right?
-Of course.

525
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,902
Are we still on for tonight?
Early as we planned?

526
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:50,240
Seven-thirty, eightish, right?

527
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,871
Do you remember

528
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,644
the RiGO BoSD fashion
show we talked about?

529
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,447
What about it?

530
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,189
It's tonight.

531
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,226
Tonight? So, you're not
going out with me?

532
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:14,563
No, I just have to be there.
I have to run the catwalk.

533
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,763
There's no way you can skip it?

534
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,732
I have to be there until midnight.

535
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,878
I can't believe you!

536
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,679
Don't get mad!

537
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:28,307
Just like that time
for my mom's birthday!

538
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,444
All that fashion shit
just to get noticed!

539
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,079
I'm sorry about your mom's.
That was a year ago!

540
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,521
Are you going to say,
"I'm sorry," again?

541
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,423
But, Choco, it's not my fault!

542
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,620
Is it mine?

543
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,128
It's not mine either!

544
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,825
You just told me
you were leaving tomorrow!

545
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:48,097
I forced you to do
all this shit, right?

546
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,332
You know how much I hate you
being involved in this shit!

547
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,675
The one thing you give
a shit about!

548
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,441
You don't give a fuck
about anyone else!

549
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,253
Until midnight?
You'll be modeling for four hours?

550
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:05,847
I'm the top model in the show!

551
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,923
-Are you the only one?
-Not the only one.

552
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:11,425
Back and forth for four hours?

553
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,621
Then tell me, what should I do?

554
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,356
Don't yell at me.

555
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,834
-I am not yelling at you!
-Lower your voice.

556
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,560
The same goes for you!

557
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,569
And on top of everything
you tell me to shut up!

558
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:24,969
On top of what?

559
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:28,369
Don't yell at me then.
I'm not yelling.

560
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,007
There is no way to talk to you.

561
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,452
And no....

562
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,153
Never mind!

563
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,017
You know what?

564
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,784
It's better if we both chill.

565
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,421
I'm leaving tomorrow, so....

566
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,085
I don't know if I should go
with you tonight.

567
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:51,224
Of course I want you to come.
I want to be with you all night.

568
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:55,235
Why do you always have to find
a way to piss me off?

569
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,405
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

570
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:45,181
With a big round of applause
from you all, let the show begin.

571
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,914
Ladies and gentlemen,

572
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:24,284
introducing, Love!

573
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:29,263
Top Model for RiGO BoSD,
women's collection.

574
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:57,756
RiGO BoSD, presents
their evening wear collection.

575
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:31,493
Hi! What have you been up to?

576
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:32,720
Look how much you've grown!

577
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,360
I can't believe it!
Where have you been all this time?

578
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,467
Look at her! She's loving it!

579
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,069
I haven't seen you for so long.

580
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,202
Just look how big you are!

581
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:47,565
I can't believe it.

582
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:52,613
Hey, you fuck! Don't you realize
this woman is mine?

583
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,809
What's wrong with you,
you shameless fuck?

584
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,613
Easy, man! Easy!

585
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,484
Want me to kick
the shit out of you?

586
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,616
-You fucking fag!
-What's your problem, man?

587
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,389
-Come here, you fucking pussy!
-I'll fucking kill you!

588
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,658
-Come here, then! I'm not afraid!
-Choco, calm down!

589
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,461
Who's that motherfucker?

590
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,068
How can you do this to me?
This is my party!

591
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,602
Bitch! Right in my face!

592
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,296
He almost fucking
French kissed you!

593
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,134
Get the fuck out of my sight,
you fucking whore!

594
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:20,334
-You're crazy!
-Get a grip, you asshole!

595
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,445
Get the fuck out of my face!

596
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,475
I don't want to see or hear you!

597
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,305
Get lost! Get Lost!

598
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,279
-Calm down, Choco!
-Don't fucking touch me! I'm leaving.

599
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,615
-No, it's not going to end like this!
-Calm down sir!

600
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,484
I'm leaving.

601
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:37,650
Come back! You're not going
to leave me here like this!

602
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,024
-Asshole!
-Let him go.

603
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,155
I told you a thousand times,
he's an idiot!

604
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,064
-Calm down, please!
-This is so embarrassing!

605
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,830
I know! Everybody's here.

606
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,102
Breathe! Take a deep breath.

607
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:59,982
So, relax, Claudia.
This is the perfect place for you.

608
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:04,144
-Good, because I've had it.
-I need a break.

609
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:08,849
-Check those guys out!
-Yeah, we need some time off.

610
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:14,726
We shouldn't have to put up
with our husbands all the time.

611
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:15,660
Look, Choco!

612
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,597
-Finally, he shows up!
-It's about time.

613
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,031
-How you guys doing?
-Good.

614
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,039
So, she finally let you go, huh?

615
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,642
-At the end of the night.
-You know, I do as I please!

616
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,874
Dude, you got to catch up!

617
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:38,283
Miss, another whiskey, please.

618
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,288
And you guys sitting here
as usual with no pussy around.

619
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,827
Yeah, right, let me show you!

620
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,897
Those three women
were over here earlier.

621
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,523
And that Brazilian woman
is the best one here.

622
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,665
Isn't that the Brazilian wife of...?

623
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,137
Yeah, she's married.
That's the only problem!

624
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,537
Don't worry. I'm not jealous.

625
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,701
Are you kidding me?
You can't pick her up.

626
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,212
I'll pick up any one you want.
You just point her out.

627
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,340
-You're full of shit!
-I bet you can't make out with her.

628
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,214
-What do you want to bet?
-A case of beer.

629
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,016
-Damn, you're cheap!
-Then what do you want to bet?

630
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:17,388
-A bottle of whiskey.
-Okay, a bottle of whiskey.

631
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,119
You can't chicken out.

632
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,594
You have to make out
with her here.

633
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:25,758
If you fuck her later,
that's your business.

634
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,029
You can feed your snake later.

635
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:30,962
-Okay, watch me!
-Let's see.

636
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:40,546
-He won't be able to do anything.
-She's married.

637
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:44,017
Look at her.
Somebody finally got lucky tonight.

638
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,053
Hi.

639
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,852
I'm Choco.
What's your name?

640
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,187
Marianna.

641
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,317
I'm Maya.

642
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:53,520
What are you up to?

643
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,597
Having a little fun.

644
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,599
-You have a very beautiful friend!
-We're taking her out for the night.

645
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:02,135
I noticed you have an accent.
Where are you from?

646
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,796
I'm Brazilian.

647
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,841
You speak Portuguese?
That's great!

648
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:11,108
She's quick. We come here
every week, and nothing.

649
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:16,584
Oh, Belen has beautiful beaches.
I'm studying here.

650
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,245
-How nice.
-Yeah, I speak, but with an accent.

651
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:25,953
-I can understand you perfectly.
-Maybe we can practice together.

652
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,422
Do you want to dance with me?

653
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,759
Yeah, but I don't know
about this music.

654
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,730
I can teach you if you want.

655
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,165
When you go to Brazil,
I'll teach you.

656
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,770
This time it's my turn.

657
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,839
Great! Thanks!

658
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:41,137
-You go in front.
-And you stay behind.

659
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,081
Fucking asshole!

660
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,095
Nice cock, buddy!

661
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,326
Bastard!

662
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,165
Fuck you, faggot!

663
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,158
Why am I carrying your shit?
I'm not your bitch.

664
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:11,351
That's what I brought you for.

665
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,223
Don't be a jerk, dude.

666
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,132
Leave the suitcases here.
They aren't open yet.

667
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,202
They'll open in minutes.

668
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,305
-What do you mean?
-We have to wait minutes.

669
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,668
Then why did you wake me up
so early?

670
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,243
The ticket says we have
to be here two hours early.

671
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,006
-You always do this shit.
-Two hours early....

672
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,615
-This is not my first time traveling!
-Calm down.

673
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,843
I'm nervous just like you.

674
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,953
Ma'am, you can use
my belt if you'd like.

675
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,681
I'm going to have to, because
this kid has no respect for me.

676
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,850
Look how he talks to me.
Even on our last day together.

677
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:47,520
Hide the alcohol!
Look who's coming.

678
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,290
-How are you?
-What a night, huh?

679
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,096
Did you feed the snake?

680
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,272
Guys, tell your jokes later.

681
00:57:56,406 --> 00:58:00,809
Now I need you to help me
advise this child.

682
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,104
Son, please, when you get there,

683
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,010
don't leave
your suitcases unattended.

684
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,949
They might get stolen.

685
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,111
Mom, I'm not a 10-year-old!

686
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,651
Don't forget to tell him about AlDS.

687
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,555
Yes! I've been telling
him all night.

688
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:21,255
Don't sleep around without
meeting their parents first.

689
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,161
The last thing I want to see
is you coming home with AlDS.

690
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,962
Mom, they're pulling your leg!

691
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,297
-ls that right?
-We'd never do that to you, ma'am!

692
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:33,431
You're the one who isn't serious.

693
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,475
And on top of everything
look who's here!

694
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,773
Oh, God, I predict lots of crying!

695
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,584
Too bad I didn't bring an umbrella!

696
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,147
And your aunts aren't here yet!

697
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,188
Don't even think
about calling them now!

698
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,621
I'm going to call them
and ask them to come.

699
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,421
-I don't want anybody to come!
-Don't talk to me like that!

700
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,029
What nerve!

701
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,393
Hey, Choco, don't you go
telling her about last night.

702
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,267
They must be coming, because
they're not picking up.

703
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:19,719
Okay, ready.
Oh, the surprise!

704
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:22,885
What did you do this time?

705
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,256
Don't tell me she got you
to do something!

706
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,454
Wait. I'll get it.

707
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:32,065
-What did you do?
-Nothing. We're innocent.

708
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,699
You know I hate these scenes!

709
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,310
Let the bash begin!

710
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,704
You can't see anything!

711
01:40:57,818 --> 01:40:59,376
Fucking A!

712
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:29,341
Welcome to the world of real men!

713
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:32,884
-Congratulations, dude!
-You're a real man now!

714
01:41:35,656 --> 01:41:37,851
What the fuck? What's up, man?

715
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:43,093
-Are you okay, bro?
-Just give me a second.

716
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:45,528
Are you all right?

717
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:51,704
-Come on, we'll take you home.
-Wait until he gets better.

718
01:41:51,839 --> 01:41:53,932
What happened there?

719
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,235
Let's go, Mr. Real Man.

720
01:41:57,211 --> 01:41:59,975
-Dude, don't make fun of him.
-I'm not making fun of him, asshole!

721
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:02,038
-Shut the fuck up, guys!
-Can't you see he's upset?

722
01:42:02,182 --> 01:42:08,644
-What the fuck is your problem?
-We all forced him to go fuck!

723
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:12,124
It's over, man!
