1
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:40,458
This is a story about
stick figures who live

2
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:46,727
in a world full of monsters
and explosions and raccoons

3
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,683
and a lot of other cool stuff too.

4
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,562
And it all takes place
on a little planet we

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,770
like to call Earth.

6
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,105
There it is.

7
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,700
Fart.
Who the fuck cares?

8
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,329
I can't wait for lunch.
My god.

9
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,059
Do you think there are going to
be boys at this school or what?

10
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,712
Ew!
Boys have cooties.

11
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,505
Audios, assholes.
I'm late for a rave.

12
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,798
Yee!

13
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,472
No!

14
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,887
Not the Explosion Factory!

15
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,863
Where'd you learn to walk...
cripple school?

16
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,449
Nice!

17
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,160
If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands.

18
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,571
Kiss my butt losers.
Hey, bitch.

19
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,540
You want a pixie stick?
My mom says those turn you into a whore.

20
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,085
Probably!
Hello, Blue!

21
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,662
Hey, Lord Tourettes.
Wow!

22
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,921
First day of class?
Yeah.

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,007
Splendid!
Mine as well!

24
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,385
Say, there's a young jerk
face looking for you.

25
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,046
Says he wants to beat your
back until you die.

26
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,302
Well, ta-ta.
Ha ha ha!

27
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,391
Wee.

28
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,688
Sup, bro.
You new here or what?

29
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,853
Yeah.
First day.

30
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,686
Must be 'cause otherwise you'd know
that this seesaw's for fifth graders.

31
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,612
Sorry.
I didn't know.

32
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,024
Yeah?

33
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,489
Price for playing on the fifth grade
playground is your milk money.

34
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,867
But I'm lactose intolerant.
Really?

35
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,910
Well let's see if you're
fist-tose intolerant.

36
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,802
What's the matter, blue kid?
My mom says I drink too much water.

37
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,381
That's how come I cry so much and pee.
Gross!

38
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,343
You know, I got held back five
years, but my muscles didn't.

39
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,353
Old MacDonald had a farm, now
you're going to die, nerd!

40
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,529
What is that?
Wow.

41
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,490
Look, it's an asteroid!

42
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,129
Sup?

43
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,093
My god!

44
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,925
Who is that?
It's a new kid!

45
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,214
Get him!

46
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,509
My god.
You're so sexy.

47
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,008
I know.
Dude, you saved my life!

48
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,557
I know.
What's your name?

49
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,057
I know.
I mean, I'm Red.

50
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,267
My name is Blue.

51
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,938
No matter what happens, I promise
I will always be your friend.

52
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,068
I know cuz I'm awesome!

53
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,047
Gelato.
Mama mia!

54
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,148
Come on, Blue, please.
I'm not going to tell you.

55
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,817
Please, please, please.
No way.

56
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,237
I got you the greatest birthday
present of all time.

57
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,746
I'm not going to spoil the surprise.
You're such a jerk.

58
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,166
My god!

59
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,081
Wow!

60
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,038
You a jerk and a wuss.
No.

61
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,124
All right you pussy.

62
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,673
I got to go to work.
See you later, Blue.

63
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,305
I'll call you tonight.
Okay, smoopsie poo-poo pie.

64
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,717
I can't wait to see what you
get me for my birthday.

65
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,392
Hey, toots!
Go to hell, Red.

66
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,432
Okay!
See you there!

67
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,727
Gelato.

68
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,855
Dude, this place is a dump.
You know where there is a dump?

69
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,440
Your bed.
Ha ha ha!

70
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,446
God dammit, dude.
Not again.

71
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,857
Use the toilet!

72
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,902
Gelatto.

73
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,779
Mr. Dingleberry.

74
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,457
You haven't paid rent in eight months.
My god.

75
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,290
You're right.
Here, let me get my checkbook.

76
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,374
Okay.
I'll just wait right here.

77
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,918
Gelato.
Again.

78
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,722
Expired, expired, rotten, poison.

79
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,724
Dude, you've been playing that
first level for three hours.

80
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,890
Can you really not make that jump?
I can make it.

81
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,517
I just hate that little guy.

82
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,979
Momma mia!
Move over.

83
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,402
I've got a degree in advanced joystick
theory and I ain't afraid to use it.

84
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,898
Yeah, I heard you practicing last night.
Olivia.

85
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,614
Mon.
You do it for me every time.

86
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,121
There, done with hand crocheted
towel of Olivia Mon.

87
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,451
Time to jack off.

88
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,413
Let me show you how this shit's done, son.
What the fuck?

89
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,792
Who took the lights?

90
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,462
I mean, we haven't paid the
electricity bill in seven months.

91
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,669
We pay for electricity?
You don't!

92
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,376
I do.
Wait!

93
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,903
All of our food's going to go bad!
All of our food is bad!

94
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:31,348
Can't let precious foods go to waste.
Dude, you know that's all expired?

95
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,024
I don't care!
God.

96
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,981
Not the milk!

97
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,613
I'll keep you safe in
my belly, cow juice.

98
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,610
I think I'm gonna vom.
Hey, listen.

99
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,155
I, I got a big problem.
I totally just lied to Pink.

100
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,441
Her birthday's next week and
I told her I got her the

101
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,417
greatest gift of all time, but
I didn't get her anything!

102
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,710
Give her this mayonnaise jar.
No.

103
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,621
Come on.

104
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,623
You know what girls like, right?
What should I get her?

105
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,175
Hey, you should go see the raccoon...
See who?

106
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,424
The rac...
What are you trying to say?

107
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,842
I can only say so many
words before I...

108
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,430
The raccoon!

109
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,147
He's got the coolest stuff.

110
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,694
Yesh!

111
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,494
I don't know if I should get my
girlfriend a gift in the pawn shop.

112
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,151
You should get her this cool hat!
Yeah, try it on.

113
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,789
So, you want a
gift for your girlfriend, hey?

114
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,243
Whoa.

115
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,869
How'd you know?
You talk very loud.

116
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,207
Fits perfect!

117
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:43,003
Did you touch that fucking bear trap?
No.

118
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,672
Idiot.
Um.

119
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,553
So me and my girlfriend have
been dating a long time and I

120
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,965
want to get her something
super romantic.

121
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,799
I've got the perfect gift for you.
But first, a story.

122
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,060
No!
People stories.

123
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:04,271
A long time ago in ancient
Japan my country was at war.

124
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,532
My small village was
all that was left.

125
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,740
Knowing I may die in battle,
I gave my wife a symbol of

126
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,157
undying love, a lotus flower.

127
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,169
Armed with the weapon of my
ancestors, the Great Sword of

128
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,957
Destiny, I'd have to
confront my fate.

129
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,048
But the mighty beast, Ocho
Muerto, emerged from the sea

130
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,464
and took my wife.

131
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,304
I was too late.

132
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:38,723
In my rage, I fought the
Tachigami Demon Army and slew

133
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,313
ten hundred thousand
hundred warriors.

134
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:48,107
Honorably, all that remain was
Armor Tachigami himself.

135
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,369
Though he shattered the bread
and scattered it to the wind,

136
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,748
as he lay dying he said
to me, fuck you.

137
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,533
He was a douche bag.

138
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,921
You may have won the battle,
raccoon, but the ghosts of my

139
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,835
warriors will haunt the Great
Sword of Destiny forever!

140
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,756
And with that he
died, but his curse remains

141
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:17,677
guarding the sword against any who may
seek to use it's great power again.

142
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:22,099
But the power of the bread was
too strong, even for me.

143
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:26,691
And in the fury of battle, I
found I destroyed not only the

144
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:31,404
Tachigami Demon Army,
but all of Japan!

145
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:38,077
Dishonored, my kinsmen banished me
from my home never again to return.

146
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,750
Sorry.
I was bored by my own story.

147
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,040
Wait!
So where's the sword?

148
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,967
There is only one left alive who knows.
Who?

149
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,252
Hold up.

150
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,421
Why the hell would I give Pink a sword?
This is retarded.

151
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,805
No!

152
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,769
Bring me the sword and in return, I shall
give you the greatest gift a girl...

153
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,520
No!
A woman...

154
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,726
No!

155
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,109
A goddess could hope
to ever receive.

156
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,977
Is it a dick?
Yes.

157
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,770
Really?
No.

158
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,818
You're very gullible.

159
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,154
Well, who even knows
where it still is?

160
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,196
You must find the man
who considers me his

161
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,617
greatest enemy, my son, Son Sun.

162
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,462
Nope.
You're weird.

163
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,798
I'm just going to go buy her some flowers.
Shit, I'll find that sword.

164
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,921
This sounds awesome.
What?

165
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,347
Really?
Yeah, man.

166
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:41,807
It's a 10,000-year-old sword hidden
in Japan guarded by demon ninjas.

167
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,688
That's the most awesome thing
I've ever heard of!

168
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,936
Dude, you're going to get yourself
killed going after that thing.

169
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:46,975
Maybe.

170
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,149
But at least I'm not a god damn Pussy!
I'm not a pussy!

171
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,111
You are a pussy
with a capital vagina!

172
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,868
I told you about the bread
because I thought you would

173
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,031
have the courage to do something
extraordinary.

174
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,073
Yeah, right.

175
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,289
All he does all day is sit in his
room playing with his joystick.

176
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,126
He'd totally get killed.

177
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,546
Have fun staying home, man!
I'll send you a post card.

178
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,386
This was a mistake.

179
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:19,550
Only a true hero could find the
great sword of destiny.

180
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,560
But I can see now, it is not you.

181
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,434
You're wrong.

182
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,144
Oh?
Yeah.

183
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,654
I'm going to find the shit
out of that sword.

184
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,361
It's going to be very dangerous.

185
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,699
Good, pussy's hate danger
and I'm not a pussy.

186
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,792
Give me that!
Aw, yeah!

187
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,666
Time to get our quest on!
Woo!

188
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,469
Okay.
Maybe I was wrong.

189
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,090
This is pretty scary.
Seriously?

190
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,724
Do you want to get Pink
a sick present or not?

191
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:02,971
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

192
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,723
Let's go.
Aw, yeah.

193
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:09,311
Follow my lead.
Crap.

194
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,480
There's guards.
What do we do?

195
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,652
Cartwheel.
Cartwheel?

196
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,156
Holy shit!
Did you see that?

197
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,609
No.
Me neither.

198
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,868
Shew.

199
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,912
Hey, you hiding behind those crates!
Cartwheel, dude!

200
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:30,166
Where'd he go?
Damn cartwheels every time.

201
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,545
Woo.

202
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,456
See, how would you have
any fun without me?

203
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,629
Reading is fun.
Your mom's fun.

204
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:41,839
Now let's find ourselves a boat.
How about this one?

205
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,137
It's perfect.

206
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,895
Dude, let's just get on that one.
No way!

207
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,857
Have you seen how awesome this thing is?
The guns have guns.

208
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,610
This one's got boobs and beer.
Red?

209
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,322
Boobs and beer!

210
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,704
I'm going to regret this.

211
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,114
Holt, bro.

212
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,076
This booze cruise is for college
house dudes and dudettes only!

213
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,460
Oh, holy shit!
You're that freshman 15 dude, dude.

214
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,462
Didn't you, like, nail 15 freshman
chicks in, like, one night?

215
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,089
Naked party!
Here we go!

216
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,467
Woo!
Oh, shit!

217
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,390
That's, like, four!
Fuck my life!

218
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,596
Oh, yeah.

219
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,561
That was back in my college years.
Can't believe this, only 15.

220
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,187
Yes, bro.
Yes!

221
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,729
That what I'm talking about!
Dude, welcome aboard bro dude bro.

222
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,019
Keg's on the poop deck, babes
on the port side.

223
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,564
Watch out for Neptune.
Party foul!

224
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,240
Aw.
Whoa!

225
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,404
Titties, here I come!
Oh, wow.

226
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,203
That was away easy.
Halt, bro!

227
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,037
This party train's sailing for Port Cool
so consider yourself the third wheel.

228
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:50,791
Wait.

229
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,310
But I thought we were cool?
You thought thinking was cool?

230
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,537
Dude?

231
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,049
What the hell?
Sorry, dude!

232
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,053
Should have banged more freshmen chicks!
How the fuck am I going to get to Japan?

233
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,932
Take your car, Stupid!
Hey!

234
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,352
We only have room for one more pallet!
Should we load the beer or the life vests?

235
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,976
Load the beer!
No regrets!

236
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,061
No regrets!

237
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:25,151
Let's get this party started.
Captain DJ, make that anchor drop.

238
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,412
And so Red and Blue
took a booze cruise across the

239
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,461
ocean blue, but they were attacked by
pirates and they were all beheaded!

240
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,126
Just kidding.

241
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,920
They all got sea scurvy and
died out of their butts.

242
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,130
No.
These are all lies.

243
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:51,018
Unfortunately, they made it to Japan.
But pirates sounded pretty cool, right?

244
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,270
All right.
Here's Japan.

245
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,973
Whoa!
All right!

246
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,707
Dude, this place is so racist.
Pay phone, bitches.

247
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,709
You ladies want to sumo wrestle?
I'm gonna die here.

248
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,048
See ya, dudes! No regrets!

249
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,876
No regrets, dudes!
Aw, so happy.

250
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,693
I am so angry!

251
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,658
I'm in danger of failing out
of Ninja Video Game Academy.

252
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,451
I'm in love with him.
Fuck you.

253
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,291
Why do the koi fish cr-cr-cry?

254
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,965
Why do the koi fish die, die, die?
This place is too cartoony for me.

255
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,548
Why do the koi fish cry, cry, cry?

256
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,386
Da, da, da, da, da,
da, da, da, dead.

257
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,216
Oh, sick!
Ramen.

258
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:16,646
This this some crunchy ass rice.
Red, that's a bowl of tiny cell phones.

259
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,517
I've had a lot of painful poops,
but this is gonna be a bad one.

260
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,396
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

261
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,318
You need the directions?
Oh yeah.

262
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,566
Wow.
That would be great.

263
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,744
Thanks!
Um.

264
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,422
We're trying to get to this restaurant.
Do you know it?

265
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,285
Ha.
He.

266
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,705
Are you okay?

267
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,585
What is wrong with her face?

268
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:49,962
Yeah.

269
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,723
You are extremely unhelpful.

270
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,110
Oh, my god.

271
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,961
All those animes
were documentaries.

272
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,946
That sushi restaurant better be close.
I'm hungry for some more cell phones.

273
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,959
Dude, I think we're here.

274
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,678
How are we going to know what
the racoon's kid even looks like?

275
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,847
Please, have a seat.
Guess he's not here.

276
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,890
Can I help you?

277
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:43,899
We... we've traveled a long
way to find this village.

278
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,861
Do you know the raccoon?
The raccoon?

279
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,193
I hate that guy.
His voice sounds so stupid, right, guys?

280
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,861
Ha, ha, ha.
Totally.

281
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,706
Eat your noodles.
I don't want to eat my noodles!

282
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,085
I am Son Sun,
son of Papa Sun, the one you

283
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:07,048
call the raccoon.
What?

284
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,677
This is my wife, Wife Sun,
and my son, Grand Son Sun.

285
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,760
Raccoon looks nothing
like his family.

286
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,391
A family he
abandoned when he dishonored

287
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,645
the mighty Japan with the
Greatest Sword of Destiny.

288
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:25,525
It was too powerful for him and
you will never find it!

289
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,103
Oh, this is some bullshit!

290
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,694
I want some god damn sushi!

291
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,656
I will cut the sushi
after I cut you!

292
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,750
Wasabi!
A spicy seaweed!

293
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,294
Miso!

294
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,299
Hot tea!
Fuck you!

295
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,508
Ooh!
Okay.

296
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,919
I will make you sushi.

297
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,392
Oh, thank Godzilla.

298
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,224
I think I like the
cell phones better.

299
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,891
So the raccoon, Papa Sun, said that
you'd know where to find the sword.

300
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,737
I swore an oath
that I would never reveal

301
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:12,108
the location of the weapon so it may
never fall into his hands again.

302
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,731
Oh, no.
It's not for the raccoon.

303
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,321
It's for me.
Well, that's fine.

304
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,684
It's just up at that mountain.

305
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,495
Nope.

306
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,374
Whoa!
Red Sun, you're so fat.

307
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,588
I had a whole bowl of cell
phones for lunch.

308
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,424
That explains it.

309
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,138
Oh, sick.

310
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,679
Damn, I bet they got hella
swords in there.

311
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,477
Hey.
Hey, why you no pay?

312
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,486
Mr. Makasan, you stop!
Very dangerous!

313
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,738
You go no further!
Sorry, man.

314
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,498
We're kind of getting our quest on.
Yeah.

315
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,645
Don't worry about it, pussy.

316
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,201
Getting my quest on, singing
the quest song.

317
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,781
Red!
Dude, wait!

318
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,201
All the girls are like... -
Who's that brave ass dude?

319
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,415
It's mother fucking
Red in the Temple of Doom,

320
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,421
boulders, air, roach,
snakes and spiders.

321
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,083
I'm not scared of anything,
not even fire.

322
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,262
A creepy ass castle and a mountain mask,
walking right inside and I'm kicking it's ass.

323
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,432
Aw, a splinter.

324
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,394
This place might be dangerous
after all.

325
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,101
Whoa.
There it is.

326
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,645
Man, that little panda was right.

327
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,623
My god.
That's a bad one.

328
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,704
Evasive maneuvers.

329
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,931
It's just the hilt of the sword!
The what of the sword?

330
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,764
It's just the handle!
That sucks.

331
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,143
You think?

332
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,305
We came all this way for
the god damn handle!

333
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,063
Man, this is a cool drawing.
It's got, like, all three condiments.

334
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,020
You mean continents?
Yeah.

335
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,565
There's squiggle, super
squiggle and America.

336
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,822
Which one are we are now?
We're on squiggle!

337
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,996
So there's two pieces left?
I guess so.

338
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,031
I don't fucking know.

339
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,675
Oh, hey, guys.
Sup?

340
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,512
We are the Tachigami Demon Army.

341
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:50,601
Our blades burn like fire and
our fire stings like ice and

342
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,438
our ice is really fucking cold.

343
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,025
We are cursed to protect the
Great Sword of Destiny from

344
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,657
anyone who seek to use
its might power.

345
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,692
We don't want to use it.

346
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,157
I-, I just wanted a birthday
present for my girlfriend.

347
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,323
Then we shall kill her too
because she will have the sword.

348
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,372
Wait dude.
Can't we talk about this?

349
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:18,798
The only thing we're going to talk
about is, how that you're about to be!

350
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,009
Crack this!
This party sucks!

351
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,754
Run for it!
Seize their swords!

352
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,891
From our point of view, they
are the villains, not us!

353
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,303
He's supposed to be rational
from our side of the story!

354
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,221
Dude, that's just cra!

355
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,685
Stop running your mouth and
start running your legs!

356
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,479
Why?
Are the cops coming?

357
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,142
Yes.

358
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,072
This is all your fault!

359
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,953
I don't know why I ever let
you talk me into this!

360
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,076
You shut up!
The cops are coming!

361
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,040
They're not cops!
They're demons!

362
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,663
Really?

363
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,787
Why do demons scare you less than cops?
Demons don't have guns.

364
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,187
I should have never gone
on this stupid quest.

365
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,464
I would have been better off
getting her that bear trap.

366
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,770
You mean that sweet hat?

367
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,263
Red, come on!

368
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,988
Be very careful with that dynamite.
It's going to the Explosion Factory.

369
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,339
Holy crap, we made it.
And we're floating away!

370
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:27,845
What you talkin' about?

371
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,844
I mean, the tides are carrying
us out to sea!

372
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,347
Aw, yea!
Bermuda Triangle, here we come!

373
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,602
Well, what are we going to do?
I don't know.

374
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,855
But hey, at least we got sushi.

375
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,976
See ya, Japan!
You stink crazy!

376
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,401
Row boat trip!
Woo!

377
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,160
Would you shut up?

378
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,087
I don't know if you've noticed or
not, but we're in some deep shit.

379
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,328
I think it's called a rowboat.
That isn't funny!

380
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,743
We're stuck in the middle of
the ocean with only the hilt

381
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,753
of this stupid sword and now we're going
to die out here and miss Pink's birthday!

382
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,082
I don't know why you're doing all
this crazy stuff for her any way.

383
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,962
Who cares?
She's just a girl!

384
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,215
Well, I love her, okay.
That's why!

385
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,678
What does that mean?

386
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,684
Wait, you really don't
know what love means?

387
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:16,935
Course you don't.

388
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,722
It's this feeling you get
when you see someone.

389
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:24,188
Deep down inside of you your heart starts
pumping and you just feel happy all over.

390
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,483
It's the strongest most wonderful
feeling you can have for someone.

391
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,489
So you mean a boner?
No!

392
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,618
Dude, I'm in love all day.
You are such an idiot!

393
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,216
I wouldn't do all this for a boner.

394
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,037
I'd just go online and look
up pictures of your mom.

395
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,698
Shut up!

396
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,106
I'm doing this because I think
she's in love with me too.

397
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,868
No way, man.
She likes me.

398
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,167
What?
Yeah, dude.

399
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,795
She's always giving me those dirty looks.
Because she hates you!

400
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,135
Red, not every girl in the world
thinks you're cool, hot shit.

401
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,717
Yeah they do.

402
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,765
Why do you think I beat up all those
bullies back in kindergarten?

403
00:27:54,923 --> 00:28:00,100
To save my life.
What?

404
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,605
No.

405
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,640
Dude, I was trying to
impress all those chicks.

406
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,433
What?

407
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,898
Yeah, worked pretty good too.

408
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,983
You've beaten me up,
embarrassed me, screwed my

409
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,569
ex-girlfriends, crapped in my
bed, stolen my shit, eaten my

410
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,279
food and taken my money for years!

411
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,723
I stayed friends with you this
whole time because for some

412
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,081
reason I actually thought
you were my friend too!

413
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,327
Wow, you must feel pretty stupid.
Fuck you!

414
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,050
You're such an asshole!

415
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,844
I can't believe you let me think
we were actually friends!

416
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:38,225
Well maybe I'd be friends with you if you
weren't such a god damn loser all the time!

417
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,885
I'm a loser?

418
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,939
I caught you masturbating to Animal Planet!
That was one time!

419
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:48,102
You're just racist
against elephants!

420
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,522
I can't believe I stuck by
your side for 20 god damn years!

421
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,274
I'm not your friend anymore!
Good!

422
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,026
I'm not yours!
Great.

423
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,244
Awesome!
Good.

424
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,528
I'm glad.

425
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,029
Hey, baby.
This one's for you.

426
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,777
Oh, my god.
Who is that?

427
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,871
Yea.

428
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,454
So, what are you
doing after recess?

429
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,416
Holy shit.
Red.

430
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,593
Red, are you dead?
Naw, man.

431
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,798
Just tannin' my back.
God damn it.

432
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:03,686
Where are we?
We're in paradise, mon!

433
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,058
No, we're not!
We're on a deserted island!

434
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,770
We should really sail to
dinner island first.

435
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,019
No, deserted island... my god.
Is there a burrito island?

436
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,981
That sounds way better.
Oh, my god.

437
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,324
Oh, my god.
I'm actually going to die.

438
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,243
I'm going to die next to an asshole and
I'll never see Pink's boobs again.

439
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,196
Yeah, and I'm getting real worried
this place doesn't have internet.

440
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,328
Oh, shit.
Maybe...

441
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,205
Oh, no.
Where's my phone?

442
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,914
Wait, dude!

443
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,269
Didn't you eat a bowl full of
tiny cell phones for lunch?

444
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,125
Oh. yeah!

445
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,714
Come on.

446
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,299
Nope.
Dude.

447
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,840
It's not coming out.

448
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,896
Here, let me try.
Not so hard, asshole.

449
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:52,518
How about this?
Stop it.

450
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,358
Let me just to dial it
with my butt muscles.

451
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,026
Yup, this is my nightmare.

452
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,955
It's ringing!
I can't believe I'm doing this.

453
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,540
If you fart, I'll kill you.
Careful, if I fart, I'll kill you.

454
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,999
Hello.

455
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,005
You've reached Global Rescue
Services, ready to rescue you

456
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,092
wherever you are, especially if
you're stuck on a deserted island.

457
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,217
Hello.

458
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,220
Can you hear me?
Well, hello yourself baby.

459
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,972
You can rescue me anytime.

460
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,928
What are you wearing?
What are you doing?

461
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,596
Oh, you know.
Just bored at work.

462
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,265
I get off at 7 if you want to
meet up at Burrito Island then.

463
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,690
Oh, my god!

464
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,607
I think I broke the phone.

465
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:40,323
Screw you!
That is it!

466
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,197
Where are you going?
Home.

467
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,658
You can finish this god damn
quest on your own.

468
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,243
I knew you were a pussy!

469
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,420
This was the stupidest idea.

470
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,917
Stupid lame ass Blue.
That sword is gonna be tight.

471
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:03,263
Gettin' my beach on, singing the beach song,
hoping that a crab doesn't nibble my balls.

472
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,649
This place is paradise.
The sun is so warm.

473
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,238
The water's so clear.

474
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,120
The sand, like diamonds
beneath my feet.

475
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,907
The air smells sweet, like...
smoke?

476
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,785
Red!

477
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,469
Red, what did you do?
What?

478
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,631
Oh, that.
You ruin everything!

479
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,686
It's not that bad.
We're going to be burned alive!

480
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,313
What is that?
King Kong!

481
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,940
Is-is that a plane?
Bees!

482
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,567
Holy shit!
It is a plane!

483
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,236
Sky demon!
Ha, ha, ha.

484
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,902
Cheerio old chaps.
Grab a hold!

485
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,885
Perfectly executed signal
fire old chaps.

486
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,466
Spotted it a fort night away.

487
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,382
Still, damn shame you
burned down Burrito Island.

488
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,552
That was Burrito Island?
No!

489
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,518
Maybe it was Boobie Island.
No!

490
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,228
Who are you?

491
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,110
You're flying with Captain
Major Lieutenant Crookygrin,

492
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,445
Private First Class Retired.

493
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,318
You're a pilot?
And an alcoholic.

494
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,284
1,000 flights, 1,000 crashes,
perfect record.

495
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,958
Woop.
Wa-Wa-whomp.

496
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,583
Trying to flip us over you old bitch.
Did I mention I'm blind?

497
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,755
Alcohol blindness.
Ha ha.

498
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,125
You and me both, brotha.
Woo.

499
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,383
Ha ha ha.

500
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,384
What are you doing flying
all the way out here?

501
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,171
On my way to Gay Paris.

502
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,683
I'm meeting an old friend from
the war, Colonel Dingleberry.

503
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,763
Mr. Dingleberry?

504
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,855
He was a private when I knew him.

505
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,562
Haven't seen him since D-Day,
or Dingle Day as he

506
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,065
liked to call it.

507
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,397
Ha ho.

508
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,688
We are on a top secret mission
to stop two blokes from

509
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,151
finding the Great Sword of Destiny.

510
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,907
What two blokes?

511
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,818
The dossier said their
names were, what

512
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,910
was it, Red and Blue.

513
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,701
Say, tell an old blind
man your names.

514
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,671
Tom.
And Tom.

515
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,505
Tom and Tom, not enough Toms in the
world I've always said, by jove.

516
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,843
Jeff.
For sure.

517
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:52,845
This mission's important to me lads,
so important that I've quite drinking.

518
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,355
In fact, I think my alcohol blindness
is being cured as we speak.

519
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,859
I-, I think I see a cloud
and an eagle... bastard.

520
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,445
My god, the sun.
Oh, shit.

521
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,654
He's gonna see us.
What do we do?

522
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:11,777
Run away, man.
Dude, we're screwed.

523
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,613
Maybe not.
You thinking what I'm thinking?

524
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,996
Never.

525
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,450
We just get this guy sloshed and
he'll be as blind as a pelican.

526
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,832
Pelicans aren't blind.
Come on.

527
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,913
Here, Crooky a toast, for good luck.
No.

528
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,798
No.
I mustn't have a drop.

529
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,550
The fate of the queen
depends on it.

530
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,886
Wouldn't be very proper to turn
down a shot of English gin, would it?

531
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:35,467
Bitch, proper's my middle name.
Woo-hoo!

532
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,978
Tally-ho!

533
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,064
See, I told you this was a bad idea!
Whoa.

534
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,816
Dude, you're a lightweight.
Balderdash!

535
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,940
I know that sound.
Gentlemen, we're under attack.

536
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,908
Holy Crap.
Are you serious?

537
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,324
Don't worry chaps.
There's a 50-cal on the top turns.

538
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:59,499
One of you old boys be a sport and fend
off those jerries for old pip, will you?

539
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,334
All right.
You shoot the machine gun.

540
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,463
I'll keep the old guy flying the plane blind.
That is the worst plan I've ever heard.

541
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:09,668
All right, fine.
But in case I die, I still hate you.

542
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,234
I hope they shoot you in the face!

543
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,768
Seize their souls!
Oh, shit!

544
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,433
Jet packed demon ninjas!

545
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,069
We've toasted to you, so now
we got to toast to me.

546
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,901
Well, it's only customary.
To Tom.

547
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,153
Who?
Okay.

548
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,488
I got this.

549
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,215
Nice evasive maneuvers.

550
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,971
You'll leave my mother out
of this, you twat.

551
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,932
To mothers.
Everybody's got a mother.

552
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,217
Your mom's got a mother.

553
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,822
Oh, my god.
I just puked.

554
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,283
Don't get cocky!
Crooky.

555
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,623
No!

556
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,553
Hey, Red.
What's your favorite animals?

557
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,674
I like the color green a lot, but also the
bathroom because that's where you can barf.

558
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,808
Hey!
Hey, I got the last one!

559
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,689
You guys see that?
Of course, you didn't.

560
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,439
You guys see that?

561
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,816
Pull up!
We're gonna crash!

562
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,899
Are you hungry?
You got to pull up right now!

563
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,107
We're going to crash!

564
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,592
Everyone okay?
I'm fine.

565
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,016
I... I'm dying.
Oh, shit!

566
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,222
Oh, god.

567
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,723
Here.
Take this.

568
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,142
What is it?

569
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,777
You two must finish my mission now.

570
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:37,281
Stop those bastards, Red and Blue, from
finding the Great Sword of Destiny.

571
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,037
It's hidden on top
La Toure Eiffel.

572
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,951
What?
What does that mean?

573
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,208
I'm counting on you my
dear Tom and Tom.

574
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,248
No, wait!
What is La Tour Eiffel?

575
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,664
Another flight, another crash...

576
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,960
perfect record.

577
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,549
Now, tally-ho.

578
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,760
May the eagles carry
you up to heaven.

579
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,142
That dude's gonna have
a hangover tomorrow.

580
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,809
Woo-wee.
Dude, wait!

581
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,854
Since it looks like we're stuck
together, we may as well work together.

582
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,298
I mean, I guess it was pretty
sharp shooting up there with

583
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,780
those ninjas, even though
you barfed like a loser.

584
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,482
Shut up.
Come on.

585
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:23,779
Let's go find that blade.
Check please.

586
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,447
Ooh la la.
Yeah.

587
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,534
I'm going to probe this waitress
for information.

588
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,544
Wait, you're going to do what?
Red, where are you going?

589
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,802
Pick up!
Pick up!

590
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,133
Hey, it's Blue.
Just text me.

591
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,393
No one listens to voice mails.
Hey, Blue.

592
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,475
It's Pink.

593
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,558
Just calling you for the hundredth time.
Wh-where have you been?

594
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,478
Mailbox full, you crazy.
Damn it.

595
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,653
I'm going to cut you, fool!
I'm going to cut you!

596
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,868
Sup, bitch.
Hey, Stacy.

597
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,662
You haven't seen Red
around have you?

598
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,081
Blue hasn't been answering his
phone for, like, two days.

599
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,209
Who's Red?
That guy you have sex with every day.

600
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,297
Which one?
The one with the hat.

601
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,344
Oh, Steven.
Sup, babe.

602
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,386
Ready for round trace?
Never mind.

603
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,304
Red, when did you get that hat?

604
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:38,653
Sorry we couldn't meet again,
old Crookygrin but I'm sure

605
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,856
I'll see you soon.
I'm super old.

606
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,154
Are you sure it was Rouge and Blue?
Oh, yup.

607
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,361
They went that away.
Fantastic.

608
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,870
We will find them no matter what.

609
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:53,873
Comb the area and your
mustaches, especially you, Jaque.

610
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,207
Oui.

611
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,589
Excellent work,
Colonel Dingleberry.

612
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:06,013
The sword is safe thanks to you.
You said I'd get a reward.

613
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,549
And you shall.

614
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,969
You'll be seeing your
friend, Crookygrin,

615
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,763
sooner than you think!

616
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,724
Oh, shit.
Should have seen that coming.

617
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,897
Yeah.

618
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,188
Let me show you how to French kiss.

619
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,824
Why don't you show me
your toure felle instead?

620
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,071
Ha ha ha ha.
What?

621
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,907
Red, what are you doing?
Beat it, man.

622
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,576
Kind of having a
private moment here.

623
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:38,668
Garson, there seems to be
an asshole in our soup.

624
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,708
Dude, Tachigami and those
ninjas could still be out there.

625
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,718
We've got to find La Tour Eiffel.
Don't worry about him.

626
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,596
Why don't you es car go get
us a bottle of wine?

627
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,649
Don't forget that bottle of wine!
Seriously?

628
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,940
We don't have time for this?
Have you seen this place?

629
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:11,325
There's wine and women everywhere!
We're in paradise monsieur!

630
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,741
Nope, this is Paris and we got to find
that stupid blade and get out of here.

631
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,328
Why are you always bossing
everybody around?

632
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,167
What are you, the king of Europe?

633
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,957
I just don't have time for
another interruption.

634
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:30,979
Rumors, rumors, in France
it's called frommage.

635
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,390
It isn't a mirage.
And it...

636
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,819
Bagette, bagette,
it looks just like a duck!

637
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,781
You bake it in the oven and it
smells just like a shit!

638
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:56,658
Because France's favorite meal
is duck baby cheese power fuck.

639
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:02,129
Whoa.
I swear, it's just like my son.

640
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,339
Dude, is that Lord Tourettes?
Well hello!

641
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:08,044
Butt fuckers!
Yeah, that's Lord Tourettes.

642
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,380
Dude, what are you doing in Paris?
Playing the accordion.

643
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:16,891
But why are you in Paris?
To play the accordion!

644
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:22,230
Garcon, I believe there's
an accordion in our soup.

645
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,486
Garcon, I believe there
is a man in our soup.

646
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:30,609
What are you two doing here?
We're here to play the accordion too!

647
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:31,992
Really?
No.

648
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,491
Wait, we're not?
No.

649
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,828
We're trying to find something
called La Tour Eiffel.

650
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,867
La Tour Eiffel?

651
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:45,916
You must mean, the Eiffel Tower!
That's what it is?

652
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:50,757
Reg, is retarded!
Spread out.

653
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,683
Find those assholes, Rouge and Blue.
And kill them.

654
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,469
Get down.

655
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,730
I'm always getting down,
down, down, down.

656
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,858
No one kills a mime in my town.
Stop it.

657
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,189
Now the French police are
trying to kill us too.

658
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,150
This quest sucks.
Whose dumb idea was this?

659
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,243
Yours, numb nuts.
Now shut up and hide.

660
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,204
Shit!
Waiter.

661
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,706
Do you work here?
We ordered crab legs.

662
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:24,044
Oh, why yes you did.
They're right here.

663
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:28,128
Waiter, have you seen these two men?
Our crab legs?

664
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,628
Yesh.

665
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:37,847
You food looks delicious.

666
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:41,104
Mama, the crap's legs
won't come off.

667
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:44,894
You must first crack the shell.
There you go.

668
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:45,979
Take a bite.

669
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:54,074
My, your food is cooked so fresh.
It is still crying.

670
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:58,245
May I try a bite?
Please, it is too much for us.

671
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:09,791
It is rather tender.
It's our, most famous dish.

672
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,008
Ha ha.
Men!

673
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,009
Men!

674
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,045
You must come over
and try this crab.

675
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,845
Monsieur, we have finished
our sweep.

676
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:24,264
Rouge and Blue are nowhere
to be found.

677
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,852
Very well.

678
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:29,818
We'll return tonight for dinner and
make sure you have plenty of crab.

679
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,236
Check the next restaurant.

680
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,780
Take me back to the ocean.
Come on, dude.

681
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,347
Be quiet and we can
get out of here.

682
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,706
Did that crab just fart?

683
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,794
Crabs do not have butt holes!

684
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,797
Don't let them eat me!
Open fire!

685
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,766
Hurry, you got to get out of here!
Get in!

686
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,769
I'm going to hot wire this. Shit!

687
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,475
Come on.
Come on.

688
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,894
I'm not going to jail again!
Ha ha ha ha!

689
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:09,183
Thank god!

690
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,602
Lord Tourettes, can you get
us to the Eiffel Tower?

691
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,321
You bet your sweet ass!
Now buckle the fuck up!

692
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,027
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

693
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,822
Alert all units.
Get me everything.

694
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,707
Freeze, Americans!

695
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:46,971
I'll be back!

696
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,936
Woo!

697
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,549
Get your umbrellas!

698
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,980
Take the wheel, bitch!

699
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,816
Ha.

700
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,395
Where are we going?
Follow me.

701
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,855
I'll will guide you to
the cock of Paris.

702
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,362
The what of what?
Chases are great.

703
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,372
Red!

704
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,503
Gotcha.

705
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,465
Holy crap.
I almost died.

706
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:51,516
You're welcome, mother fucker.
Grab on!

707
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:06,360
There it is, the Tour Eiffel.
Ha ha ha ha.

708
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:14,623
One fact, this tower was
erected in 1889.

709
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,911
Gross.

710
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,006
Oh, crap.
They got us surrounded!

711
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,469
Ha!
You are surrounded!

712
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,049
Get off of our cock!
You get off of my cock, dick!

713
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,011
How dare you!
Be careful, he curses well.

714
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,178
LT, can you hold them off
while we get the blade?

715
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:39,269
Leave it to me!
Come on.

716
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:40,898
Oh, my god.
I'm out of shape.

717
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,859
Dude, I'm like King Kong.

718
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,697
How about a little lullaby?

719
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,782
Go to sleep.

720
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:54,872
Let the tea with dreams
of fresh baguettes.

721
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:59,335
Drink some wine my sweetheart.

722
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,340
I've got fucking ass sharts!

723
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,507
I am becoming very la sleepy.

724
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,092
Eat talking shit at the house.

725
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,979
Lullaby will make you sleep.

726
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,640
I said Tourettes, you're
the fucking dick!

727
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,816
Now what?
Stick it in.

728
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,028
Stick it in.
You're such a creep.

729
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,835
Wow.

730
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:43,336
Two pieces down, one left to go.
I wonder what that last piece is.

731
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:48,133
I hope it's a dragon.
I really don't think it's a dragon.

732
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,297
Oh, splendid.
You found it.

733
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,432
Yeah, but we're still missing
that last piece.

734
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,976
Oh, wait... the letter.
Damn it.

735
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,972
It's in French.
I can read it.

736
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,142
It says, the last piece
of the sword is...

737
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,026
Shh.

738
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:03,981
Gem.

739
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:09,157
It's a gem and it's hidden in ax...
in a mountain behind your...

740
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,453
Home town.
Fantastic.

741
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,997
Really?
Yeah.

742
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:19,330
That's super convenient.
Good f... f... luck you two.

743
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:23,835
I hope you find your destiny.
Aw, man.

744
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,920
Thanks, Lord Tourettes.
See ya.

745
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,211
Audios, little green man.
Avior, mother fuckers!

746
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:36,886
Ho ho ho.
Run!

747
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:41,023
Don't let them get away.
They have defiled France's cock!

748
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:45,061
That sword will be mine!

749
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:56,747
And so, Red and Blue
escaped from the Tachigami

750
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,000
Demon Army and the French
police and took a long

751
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,460
convoluted map journey home to
find the last piece of the

752
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:09,677
Great Sword of Destiny so Blue could get
Pink a birthday present, or something.

753
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,720
I don't know.
This movie's crazy.

754
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:16,016
Am I in your mind?
Are you in mine?

755
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,102
I am never taking a plane,
boat, submarine, turtle,

756
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,986
dragon, motorcycle, rocket,
parachute, train, hand car again.

757
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,574
Yeah.
I mean, probably not.

758
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,289
America.
It's good to be back!

759
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:44,248
Okay.

760
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,880
According to LT, the gem of the
sword is hidden in a mountain.

761
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:52,294
Are there any mountains around here?
I never noticed that before.

762
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,134
'Sup, boys.

763
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:58,091
Stacy, I see two mountains right here.
Oh, crap.

764
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,435
Not now.
Dude, we don't have time for this.

765
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,187
Pssh, it can wait a little bit.

766
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,690
The gem hasn't gone anywhere
for like a billion years.

767
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,771
Pink's birthday party is
starting any minute.

768
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,902
I got to get there.
No gem, no sword.

769
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,689
No sword, no present.
No present, no Blue and Pink.

770
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,358
Relax!
I'll just have a drink or two.

771
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:18,700
You never just have a drink or two!
I promise, just a couple bottles.

772
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,368
We'll have that whatever it is in no time.
Red!

773
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,791
Seriously, what the hell?
We're so close!

774
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,795
Don't be such a stick in the butt, dude!
We made it home!

775
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,215
It's party time, man!
Hey, ladies!

776
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,635
I don't know why I ever trusted you!
You never follow through on anything!

777
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,801
This the most important thing that's
ever happened to me and you're bailing?

778
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,102
Dude, there's boobs in here.
What am I supposed to do?

779
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,224
Be my friend!
Sorry, bro.

780
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,735
This train's leaving for
Waste-Face USA, population,

781
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,737
des hoes, des nuts and
this bottle of Jack.

782
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,777
Get over here girl!
Put your face on my sack!

783
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,318
Woo!

784
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,406
Red!

785
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:12,876
Dude, this party sucks.
They've got free beer.

786
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:17,717
Happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday.

787
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,052
Where's Blue?

788
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,474
Jesus.

789
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,978
That racoon's reward better be worth it.
I don't need that jerk.

790
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:36,740
I can do this alone.
This is for you, Pink.

791
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:40,615
I'm coming, baby.
Time to get my quest on.

792
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,997
Begin at Big Montage!

793
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:50,810
Hey, What's going on?
Oh, my god!

794
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,099
What the hell?

795
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,451
Oh, my god!
The chip is out!

796
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:15,251
He thinks it's so cool!
Isn't this cool?

797
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,422
Boss, that feels crazy.

798
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,967
I suppose we should be
thankful, Blue Sun.

799
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:29,763
You led us straight to the
Great Sword of Destiny.

800
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:35,729
And now, I am going to avenge
every person who has died... ever!

801
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,236
Wait.

802
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,021
What about all those people
who died of old age?

803
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,407
Them too!

804
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,653
That's a stupid plan!
Now give me back that sword!

805
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,991
Hmp.

806
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,577
You're a stupid plan.

807
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,868
Throw the round head
into the volcano!

808
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,011
I curse life.
Red?

809
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,718
What are you doing here?

810
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,849
After I finished drinking all
those girls and screwing all

811
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:11,512
that beer, I decided I should
come back for my friend.

812
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,857
I must be dead.
Blue Sun, the red one tells the truth.

813
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:19,941
You have a very good friend indeed.
You were right, man.

814
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,819
For once, I got to finish what I started.
Plus, that sword is pretty tight.

815
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:28,324
That's what I've been saying the whole time!
So, you're back?

816
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,911
I'm back, dude.
You?

817
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,200
You're back?

818
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:37,747
It's is time to finish what
I started 10,000 years ago.

819
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:42,255
Are you still butt hurt about that
little geisha you called a wife?

820
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:46,797
The only one
who's about to be hurt is you.

821
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,011
Ha ha ha ha ha.

822
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,347
You really think you can
defeat all of us?

823
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,146
And did you know I can go all night, baby?

824
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,310
I'm nocturnal.

825
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,785
We're in for a huge fight, aren't we?
You know it!

826
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:09,865
Try to take some notes.

827
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,746
Yeah, right.

828
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,785
I didn't play all those video
games for nothing.

829
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:24,885
New challenger appears...
K.O. Flawless victory!

830
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,087
Finish him!
Oh, my god.

831
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,051
This is actually working!
Yeah, dude!

832
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,383
Keep doing it!
Hadouken!

833
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,140
Brutality.
Animality.

834
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,055
Bestiality!
Gross.

835
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,277
You can't kill me!

836
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,610
You're just a stupid raccoon!
You need better insults!

837
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,509
Father Son.
Holy shit!

838
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:14,785
If you ever want to fight evil,
you must keep your elbows straight.

839
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,727
Father, one day
I want to go to America.

840
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,860
That is not a country yet.

841
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,646
You are Lord of Tachigami?

842
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:29,616
Did you ever wonder why
we have the same last name?

843
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:30,651
Impossible!

844
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:07,154
Father Sun, why
did you become so evil?

845
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:11,237
I had to avenge all the people
who have died in the world.

846
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:16,704
But by killing people, aren't you
creating more people you need to avenge?

847
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,581
Yes.

848
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:23,792
This way, I can do this
sweet job forever!

849
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:27,384
You are evil.

850
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:31,253
And you kept your elbows straight.

851
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,797
Siya-nara, Father Sun.

852
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,402
Oh, shit.
Nature's ninja.

853
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:51,565
Raccoon, you okay?
I am so sad.

854
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,945
But you did it, man!
You freakin' cut your dad's head off.

855
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:02,535
It is true.
Tachigami is finally defeated.

856
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,453
Yeah, that hombre is muerte.

857
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,212
What is that?

858
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,012
Ocho Muerte.

859
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:35,776
Follow me!

860
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,131
Ooh fuck!

861
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,213
Holy shit!
That's Ocho Muerte?

862
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,095
That is a big ass sushi!

863
01:01:56,254 --> 01:02:00,762
Boys, your town is in grave danger.
Oh, my god!

864
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,723
Pink!
She's probably fine.

865
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,183
Okay.
We should probably get down there.

866
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,064
Let's go!
Quickly!

867
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,071
There is no time to lose!

868
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:23,198
Hey. Pink!
Have you ever met my sister?

869
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:26,372
Happy birthday.
Thanks.

870
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,295
I just wish Blue was here.
Whatever, bitch.

871
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,376
Boys are overrated.

872
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,636
What the fuck is that?
Wow!

873
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,557
This party's crazy.
Oh, my boobs!

874
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,196
Blue?
What's going on?

875
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,362
Sorry I'm late.
It's a long story.

876
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:06,204
Just like my dick!
Really, Red?

877
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:10,963
Ocho Muerte, go back from
whence you came.

878
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:17,677
You can't kill the
Tachigami that easily!

879
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:22,307
Father Sun,
you are Ocho Muerte, too?

880
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:28,768
When you defeated me, I threw
up your wife for eternity!

881
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:33,481
A Tachigami could
never marry a geisha!

882
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,489
But Father Sun, I loved her!

883
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,490
Then how about a reunion?

884
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:47,249
Boys, it's up to you now.

885
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,332
Oh, oh, no!
No!

886
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,217
No!
Papa Sun!

887
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,506
Blue, help!
Pink!

888
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,513
Dude, the sword!

889
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,606
Cartwheel, dude!

890
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,574
Blue!

891
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,798
Blue!

892
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,459
No!

893
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:50,011
D-du-dude!
It's slipping!

894
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:53,519
You can't pull me up with just one arm!
But I'll drop the sword!

895
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:57,957
Do it or you'll drop me!

896
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,239
Sorry, dude.
What?

897
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,320
No!

898
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,405
Red!

899
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:12,700
Did you just imagine dropping me?
Maybe.

900
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:15,245
Fuck it.
Red!

901
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,922
Stop imaging ways to kill
me and pull me up!

902
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,257
Nah.

903
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,893
I thought we were actually
friends this time.

904
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:36,687
We are.

905
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,808
Holy shit.
Are you okay?

906
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,396
No way.
You?

907
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,982
Nah.
Hey, man.

908
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:27,325
I'm sorry I've been such an asshole.
I've, never really had a friend before.

909
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,197
Really?
Yeah.

910
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,531
It's all good, man.
Just stop pooping in my bed, okay.

911
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,287
I never pooped in your bed.
I've been pooping in my sleep?

912
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:39,086
Naw, I'm just messing with you.
I poop in your bed, but I won't anymore.

913
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,502
Papa Sun?

914
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:48,467
Papa Sun!
Raccoon, that you?

915
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:51,928
Raccoon.

916
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,393
I'm alive.
Whoa.

917
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:02,106
We thought you were super dead.
Seriously.

918
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:06,109
Not yet.
Momma Sun?

919
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,407
Papa Sun.

920
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:18,080
I thought I lost you forever.
No, my love.

921
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:23,623
Only for 10,000 years.
I will never lose you again.

922
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:27,802
That's your wife?
Yes.

923
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:31,340
I could not face my son after
destroying Japan and I feared

924
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,429
the sword was lost forever.

925
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:37,721
Thanks to your bravery, it has
been reconstructed and I could

926
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,562
now finally save my wife.
Wait.

927
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,768
So this whole time we were actually
risking our necks for you?

928
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,687
We got tricked!

929
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:49,399
I did trick you into
finding the sword for me.

930
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:53,196
But what you found for yourself
was friendship.

931
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:54,536
That's true.
Lame!

932
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,451
Yeah.
Yeah.

933
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,704
Pink.
Blue!

934
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,710
Pink!

935
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,998
I was so worried about you.
I thought you were dead.

936
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,383
You know I'd never miss
your birthday party.

937
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:11,297
Young lovers,
this sacred lotus flower has

938
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:14,432
kept our love strong
for 10,000 years.

939
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:18,391
May it do the same for you.

940
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:21,557
Nintendo.

941
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:25,526
Blue, it's beautiful.
I told you I'd get you something special.

942
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:29,697
I love you.

943
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,908
I love you too.
I got a boner!

944
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,364
Good one.

945
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,574
Dude, aren't you glad
you went on this quest?

946
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,868
Yeah, man.
I told you I wasn't pussy.

947
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,078
Pssh.

948
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,784
I always knew we could pull it off.
Really?

949
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,205
Well yeah, cuz we're awesome!

950
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,214
Oh my fucking god!

951
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:50,217
That shit was totally amazing!

952
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,801
Your brain can not
even comprehend.

953
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,807
So much hand shooting excitement.

954
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,810
For the sake of your couch, I
hope you're wearing Depends.

955
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:03,143
We learned so many things together.

956
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:06,776
Japan is weird and French
people slime.

957
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:12,490
This film had 10 scenes of action and
everyone together said fuck 21 times.

958
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,736
Yeah!
Dick Figures!

959
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:20,703
You just watched a whole fucking
movie of Dick Figures!

960
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,333
Dick Figures!

961
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,712
Bow before them and renounce
your creepiest god.

962
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,293
Dick Figures!

963
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:32,050
Someone get a doctor because this
movie's fucking totally sick!

964
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,633
You asked them, they delivered!

965
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:38,633
If you don't like Dick Figures it's
not hard to figure out you're a dick.

966
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,020
I counted 10 fucking
explosions and jet-packed

967
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,227
demon ninjas that rocked your face.

968
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,609
Your life was a hot
pile of garbage.

969
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:51,191
Now you're so excited that you're
nutting all over the place!

970
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:54,198
One of those explosions
was an octopus.

971
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:57,577
Sorry for the spoiler,
but it's your fault.

972
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:01,872
That'll teach you to listen to the sound
track before you watch the movie.

973
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,913
I mean, for god's sake who does that?
You stupid piece of...

974
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,545
Dick Figures!
Dick Figures!

975
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,504
Saved the world, what do you
think about Dick Figures!

976
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:14,794
Dick Figures!
You just watched it.

977
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:19,428
You're lazy and fat.
Dick Figures!

978
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:24,053
You love them with all of your stupid
heart and also part of your junk.

979
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,063
You asked them, they delivered.

980
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,442
A movie so great it made
your junk explode.

981
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,399
Whoops.
Our bad.

982
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:36,408
Sorry about your junk.

983
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,366
Just kidding!
Fuck you!

984
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:42,451
Dick Figures.

985
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:51,806
That shit was crazy!
Yeah.
