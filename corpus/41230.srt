1
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,040
There comes a time
for every vampire...

2
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,240
... when the idea of eternity becomes
momentarily unbearable.

3
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,480
Living and feeding in the shadows
with only your own company...

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,480
...rots into a solitary,
hollow existence.

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,200
Immortality seems like a good idea...

6
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,360
...until you realize
you're going to spend it alone.

7
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,880
So I slept, hoping the sounds
of the passing eras would fade out...

8
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,240
...and a sort of death might happen.

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,880
But as I lay there, the world didn 't
sound like the place I had left...

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,480
...but something different.

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Better....

12
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,400
It became worthwhile to rise again
as new gods were born and worshiped.

13
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,680
Night and day, they were never alone.

14
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,520
I would become one of them.

15
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,800
Whether it was the meal or
the 1 00 years of rest, I'm not sure.

16
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,240
But suddenly
I was feeling better than ever.

17
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
My senses so high...

18
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,360
... they led me straight to the
instrument of my resurrection...

19
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,320
...playing in my old house.

20
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,040
Jesus.

21
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,760
Your voice....

22
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,560
Who the hell are you?.

23
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
The question provoked
an irresistible urge.

24
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,040
I am the vampire Lestat.

25
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
It just rolled out of my mouth.

26
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,920
With one sentence,
I betrayed everything about my kind.

27
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
Betrayed our code of secrecy.

28
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Vampire?.

29
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,840
-That's funny.
-lndeed.

30
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,480
Hilarious.

31
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
You' re all...

32
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,040
...so beautiful.

33
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,080
-Your hands are--
-Cold as death?.

34
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,200
-You're gonna kill us?.
-No.

35
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,160
All that you've ever dreamed of,
I'm going to make yours.

36
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,840
This is your lucky day.

37
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,320
It was a bold move, I admit.

38
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,760
But from that moment on they were
my friends, my children, my band.

39
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,360
Giving the world a new god.
Me.

40
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,320
Okay, can I have your attention?.
Okay, some questions. One at a time.

41
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,920
-Yeah, you.
-So why here in London?.

42
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,640
We go where we' re told to, like you.

43
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,920
-How would you sum up your music?.
-Sex, blood and rock and roll.

44
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,160
Okay, excuse me.

45
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,880
It's time.

46
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,680
May I present...

47
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,400
...the vampire Lestat.

48
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,280
Good evening.

49
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,280
Sorry I'm late. I was just trying
to catch my breakfast.

50
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,240
Okay, can we keep it short?.
One at a time.

51
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,640
Yeah, you.

52
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,600
I may be wrong, but what
I remember about vampires is...

53
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,720
...you generally keep
your identity secret.

54
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,280
Yes. But why hide it
in this day and age?

55
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,000
I've hidden in the shadows
for centuries.

56
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,840
It's time to share myself
with the world.

57
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,000
Could you prove it?. You know, give us
a demonstration of your powers.

58
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,280
If you like, I can give you a private
demonstration in your hotel tonight.

59
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,320
Your first and only concert's
in Death Valley, just days away.

60
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,840
-Why just the one?.
-I don't like repeating myself.

61
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,720
There are rumors about
the hidden meaning in your lyrics...

62
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,440
...that you' re giving away
vampire secrets. Is that true?.

63
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,880
Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few
old friends. Daring them to come out.

64
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,320
Won't these vampires be pissed off
that you're giving away secrets?.

65
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,160
I imagine they are, yes.

66
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,800
Do you have anything to say
to the other vampires?.

67
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,920
As a matter of fact, I do.

68
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

69
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,200
See you all in Death Valley.

70
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,960
I heard Lestat keeps all these girls
in his cellar. And it's nice.

71
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,720
They give you food
and cable and weed.

72
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh, please.

73
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,160
But you have to let him suck you
on your neck whenever he wants.

74
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
-Doesn't sound too bad.
-Done worse.

75
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,400
-I'll say.
-This way, girls.

76
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,920
So this is Lestat's house?.

77
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,320
It is this week. We move around a lot.

78
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,920
Why is that?.

79
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,720
What can I say?. The guy is just....

80
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,520
-Boss. I didn't see you there.
-No. You wouldn't, would you?.

81
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,240
These are the girls
that you asked for.

82
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,400
Yes.

83
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,520
Do you want me to take
the girls home later?.

84
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,760
No, thank you, Roger.

85
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,520
I'll make sure they're taken care of.

86
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
You want some?.

87
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,000
Want me?.

88
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,640
You hungry?.

89
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,080
You hungry for something else?.

90
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,760
Come on.

91
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,560
-Don't you want to have some fun?.
-Don't do that.

92
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,160
Are you ticklish?.

93
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm very ticklish.

94
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,360
Come out, come out...

95
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
...whoever you are.

96
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,400
Jesse.

97
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,200
Jesse.

98
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,920
A voice...

99
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,840
...calling to me...

100
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
...in my dreams.

101
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,760
The same dream I've had
since I was 6.

102
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,920
I have a family of my own.

103
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,760
Not a strange dream, really.

104
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,560
One every orphan has.

105
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
l' m sorry, but you must go.

106
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,840
Why can' t I stay with you?.
Please, Aunt Maharet.

107
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,360
I don' t want you to go. But you must.

108
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,480
Aunt, you' re bleeding.

109
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,880
You must be with your own.

110
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,520
-I knew things were not normal.
-This isn 't the life I wanted for you.

111
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,680
I only knew I was part of them,
and being cast out....

112
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,120
Was I bad?

113
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Had I done something wrong?

114
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,920
l' ll always be watching over you.

115
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,480
I want to stay with you forever.

116
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,080
You can't.

117
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm Serena Altschul, MTV News.

118
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,440
Vampire turned rocker Lestat
has returned with a new CD, Forsaken.

119
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,560
Although from New Orleans...

120
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,200
...he claims to be an 1 8th-century
French nobleman...

121
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,960
... who has been asleep
for over 1 00 years.

122
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,680
Here 's a look at the new video
from the debut album, "Redeemer. "

123
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,240
Like everyone, I assumed
Lestat was a joke.

124
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,360
A rock star with a gimmick. Then one
of his lyrics caught my attention.

125
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,800
"Take a walk down the aisle
at the end of the mile.

126
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,160
Give your life to my charms
in the Admiral's Arms."

127
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,800
That rang a bell.

128
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,520
I tracked down old leases in London.

129
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,720
It turns out in the late 1 600s
there was a pub in Mile End...

130
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
...called the Admiral's Arms.

131
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,000
It had a reputation for dealing
with black magic...

132
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,640
...and reports of people vanishing.

133
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,960
Here's where you could find
the Admiral's Arms in old London.

134
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,000
That part of London
is mostly warehouses...

135
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,160
...meat-packing plants and
a private club in the same location.

136
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,720
I think that it's a vampire coven.

137
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,600
And Lestat is leading us to it.

138
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,560
-Who took this picture?.
-I did.

139
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,360
You're still an apprentice.
You don't do field work.

140
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,080
The Talamasca has a code.

141
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,760
I know. "Observe the dark realm,
but be not of it."

142
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,800
Well, it's held good for 1 2 centuries.

143
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,760
We record and observe,
but never interfere.

144
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
I had to see it for myself.

145
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,840
Is David aware of this?.

146
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Jesse?.

147
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,800
Hello, David.

148
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,120
-I was explaining--
-Why don't you see me in my office?.

149
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,240
This is a real coven.
In the middle of London.

150
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,640
All the more reason
to have told me first.

151
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,800
Listen, Jesse...

152
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,600
...we know about Lestat.

153
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,680
What he's doing is unprecedented.

154
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,200
So why is he doing it?.

155
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,840
Aren't you curious?.
Don't you think we should find out?.

156
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,280
Let me show you something.

157
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
What do you see?.

158
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,240
Mid-1 500s. Florence.

159
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,800
This one?.

160
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,360
-This man is in both.
-Yes.

161
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,880
All the different paint samples...

162
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,360
...all authentic.

163
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,040
Each painted at the time
of their particular style.

164
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
His name is Marius.

165
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,000
I've been tracing him for years.

166
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,480
My little obsession.

167
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
The closest we've come
to the original vampire.

168
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,440
Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C.

169
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,080
So he's older than Lestat.

170
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,360
He made Lestat.

171
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,320
How do you know that?.

172
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,280
Because I have Lestat's journal.

173
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,960
I want to see it.

174
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,120
Promise me you'll never
go back to that place.

175
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,520
It was the winter of 1 788.

176
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,480
And I was brought to a Mediterranean
island by the man who made me.

177
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,320
If a man is what you'd call him.

178
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,080
Lestat, welcome.

179
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,440
Who are you?.

180
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,520
Do I know you?.

181
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,680
I am unknowable by nature,
but you may call me Marius.

182
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,480
l' m the lord of a great manor.
They'll send an army to look for me.

183
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,560
I doubt they'll find you,
Lord de Lioncourt.

184
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,680
You're a long way from home.

185
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,280
You're weak...

186
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
...near passing.

187
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,440
I can barely hear your heartbeat.

188
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,600
The future hastens.
An age beyond my antique reason.

189
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,640
You will help me understand
these times.

190
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's why I chose you.

191
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,840
Chose me for what?.

192
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,680
Drink...

193
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,720
...and live.

194
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,760
You've been brave enough
for one night, my son.

195
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
Drink...

196
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,840
...and learn.

197
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,600
Good, is it not?.

198
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,680
No more. No more, Lestat.

199
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,880
No more!

200
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,120
Don't be afraid.

201
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,280
It's only your body that dies.

202
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,400
More.

203
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,080
I impressed my maker
with my thirst for things.

204
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,800
He set out to educate me
in the unknown.

205
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,400
Taught me all about the world,
its hidden history...

206
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,920
...and about myself.

207
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,400
That' s enough, my son.

208
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,280
When you feed, hold back
from the moment of death.

209
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,840
Never take the last drop, or it will
draw you in and you will die.

210
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,280
Appreciate your prey.

211
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,320
Their blood that we take into us
carries with it life...

212
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,000
...their life, their knowledge,
their complexity.

213
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,320
My senses run amuck,
like a newborn child.

214
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,320
And as for my new powers, I was beside
myself with the pleasure of it all.

215
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,320
We've stayed long enough.

216
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,240
But we've spoken to no one.

217
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,440
A vampire's life
is a life of discretion.

218
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,160
Discretion?.

219
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,720
Why must we hide, Marius?.

220
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,080
We are the powerful,
we are the immortal.

221
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,640
We should walk fearless
in the open, no?.

222
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,080
That cannot be.

223
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,640
We're vulnerable during the day.

224
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,800
Mortals must never know about us,
for the sake of all our kind.

225
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,360
So I could never know her?.

226
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,800
Not unless you wanted to kill her.

227
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,560
So I can never be known?.

228
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,800
You must be dead to the world.

229
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,240
Come on, time to leave.

230
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,920
Sophia, run! Run!

231
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,520
Go! Go--

232
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
Lestat...

233
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,920
...stop her!

234
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,680
You must!

235
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,480
We must remain in the shadows.

236
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,280
You still have a few
lingering mortal emotions.

237
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,560
They'll serve you no good, my friend.

238
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,480
Forgive me.

239
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,040
The faces of my victims haunted me,
reminding me of my fate.

240
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,520
For nights and days I played...

241
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,200
...furious that I would never partake
of the simple joys of the world.

242
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,480
I was meant for more than this.

243
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,320
Marius?.

244
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,920
Would you like me to play for you?.

245
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,360
What have you done, Lestat?.

246
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,840
-More!
-I don't think so, my little lord.

247
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,000
-Let me go.
-No.

248
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,520
You've had the purest blood,
seen the oldest things.

249
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,960
-Far too much for one as young as you.
-Her blood is like liquid fire.

250
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,520
Who is she?.

251
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,760
She's your mother.

252
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
She's my mother.

253
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Akasha, the queen of all
who are damned.

254
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
And he's her king.

255
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this
earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.

256
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,080
They drank until Enkil
lost his will to drink.

257
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,000
Without her mate beside her, she also
lost hers. They became living statues.

258
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,560
She respects nothing except the taste
of blood, human and immortal alike.

259
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,400
No. Release me!

260
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,520
She made you quite powerful.

261
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,840
You'll not stop me!

262
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,800
Can I hear her blood in your voice?.

263
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,960
In all the years of my care,
not once have they moved.

264
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,720
Until tonight. And she chose me.

265
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,120
I chose you.

266
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,200
Where are you going?. ! Marius!

267
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,360
Many times since, I have called
to Marius. But there was no answer.

268
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,200
Just the endless procession
of days, months...

269
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,840
... years.

270
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,480
My teacher left me
to my darkest lesson.

271
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,720
That in the end, we are alone.

272
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,280
And there is nothing but the cold,
dark wasteland of eternity.

273
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,480
David thought the journal
would satisfy my curiosity.

274
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,200
But it only made me want
to know more.

275
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,960
I had to go back
to the Admiral's Arms.

276
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,480
I had no choice.

277
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,360
This is a fantastic place. I love it.

278
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,640
You sure I can' t get you a drink?.

279
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,840
Soon.

280
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,400
Hi.

281
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,600
-Hi.
-Come here often?.

282
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,720
All the time.

283
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,160
I don' t see any marks.

284
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,720
You haven' t seen the rest of my body.

285
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,200
Is that an invitation?.

286
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Sorry, I'm taken.

287
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,320
And...

288
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,960
...where is your host?.

289
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,680
He's here somewhere.

290
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,680
This host, what's his name?.

291
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,800
Marius.

292
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,280
Sorry, don't know the guy.

293
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,720
-Of course not. He's an ancient.
-There aren't any ancients left.

294
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,400
They all turned to dust.

295
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,840
So unless you've got him in a bottle
somewhere....

296
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,960
You're brave to joke.
I wish you could meet him.

297
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,600
-And why is that?.
-Because you might learn something.

298
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,840
Excuse me.

299
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,280
Going somewhere?.

300
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,960
Now this will only hurt a little bit.

301
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,000
In fact, you might even enjoy it.

302
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Don't do this.

303
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,400
Boo.

304
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,560
That was quite a performance.

305
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,800
You should be more careful.

306
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,080
-Thanks.
-For what?.

307
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,160
You saved me.

308
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,720
How presumptuous.

309
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,960
So you know Marius?.

310
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,720
I know a lot of things.

311
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,480
Not how to stay alive, apparently.

312
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,880
I guess we have that in common.

313
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,240
Although I'm a little ahead
of the race here.

314
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,840
Well, I can fix that.

315
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,600
Your song " Redeemer" is about
the girl with the violin. lsn't it?.

316
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,360
Yeah.

317
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,920
Is it?.

318
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
What else do you think you know?.

319
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,240
l....

320
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,800
You're shaking.

321
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,320
Cold.

322
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,800
Still cold?.

323
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,080
Go on. Tell me more about me.

324
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,840
You want....

325
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,920
What do I want?.

326
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,560
-You yearn.
-What do I yearn?.

327
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
For what do I yearn?.

328
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,640
To walk with the living.

329
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,480
Out of the cold,
dark wasteland of eternity.

330
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Well...

331
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,400
...that makes you
a very clever librarian.

332
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,000
Talamasca.

333
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,520
I knew I left that journal somewhere.

334
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,960
-Was it a good read?.
-lt touched me.

335
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,120
Did it, now?.

336
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,320
Don't worry, Jesse.

337
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,200
Your kind never satisfies my thirst.

338
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,320
Lestat, I know something
that's not in your journal.

339
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,760
What?.

340
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,600
You still have the violin, don't you?.

341
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
No, I understand.

342
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,840
After all, it's only human.

343
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,120
Clever librarian.

344
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,600
David, listen, I'm going
to Los Angeles for the concert.

345
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,240
I met him, David. I talked to Lestat.

346
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,600
What?. Jesse?.

347
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,200
Listen to me very carefully now.

348
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,640
You are no longer seeing
things clearly.

349
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,400
Lestat told the world that vampires
live among us. They're mad.

350
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,960
They'll be at the concert to kill him.
You've become obsessed with it.

351
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,640
-I'm worried about you.
-Don' t worry about me. l' ll be okay.

352
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,680
l' ll check in and....

353
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,240
l' m sorry. I have to go.

354
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,000
No, Jesse--

355
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,960
The city of Lost Angels already
fed on the blood of youth.

356
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,240
My presence here barely
stirred a ripple.

357
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,720
We had three days till the concert.

358
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,320
I could feel something was coming.

359
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,520
I just couldn 't figure out what.

360
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,480
Marius.

361
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,760
Lestat.

362
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,440
It is good to see you, Lestat.

363
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,000
And you.

364
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,680
Still wearing the old fashions, I see.

365
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,520
Old habits die hard.

366
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,640
How did you manage to slip
through the ' 50s in red velvet?.

367
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,720
I slept.

368
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,200
Don't think you missed much.

369
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,880
-Elvis.
-Elvis, yes.

370
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,960
You're bigger than he is now.

371
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,320
So....

372
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,200
After all this time...

373
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,600
...what's the occasion?.

374
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,040
You've just become very hard to avoid
these days, at least in conversation.

375
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,400
-What are you trying to prove, Lestat?.
-Oh, please.

376
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,640
It's a little too late to come over
all paternal now, Marius.

377
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,440
Two hundred years
and not a word from you.

378
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,600
You almost cost me everything.

379
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,000
Now you've done it again.

380
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,000
This isn't the time to settle
old scores.

381
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,480
Vampires don't settle old scores.

382
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,840
We harbor them.

383
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,680
How did you find me?.

384
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,520
I made you.

385
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,080
I've always known where you are.

386
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,280
Besides...

387
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,680
...l just had to look for the most
gauche house on the block.

388
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,000
Come. Let me show you what it means
to live in the light.

389
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,720
lmpressive.

390
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,120
Reminds me of old mad druids
running around chanting in the forest.

391
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
A return to the primitive.

392
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,880
Out there, my fans...

393
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,640
...they worship me.

394
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,960
Millions of arms reach out to embrace,
beg me to come into their lives.

395
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,080
It's what you always wanted.

396
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,800
With all my black little heart.

397
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,280
Did you think of anyone but yourself?.

398
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,800
I only have myself.
You taught me that.

399
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,800
It may be time to get ready
for some company.

400
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,360
-What's that supposed to mean?.
-Your music's woken an old friend.

401
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,840
Can't you hear it?.

402
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,760
Or is the applause all you
can hear now?.

403
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,360
Akasha.

404
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,680
Arisen.

405
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,000
She has taken the king's blood.

406
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,080
Absorbed his power.

407
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,640
Good. Let her come.

408
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,040
Cancel the concert.

409
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,600
Never.

410
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,960
You're no match for her, Lestat.
You're not a god.

411
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,320
We were once mortals too.

412
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,000
It is our heritage we protect.

413
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,880
Such reverence for mortals.

414
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,880
Then you should have left me as one.

415
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,240
Scent is fading.
He was here too long ago.

416
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,080
You like him, do you?.

417
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,120
He reminds me of someone.

418
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,800
All he's going to remind you of soon
is a pile of bones.

419
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,080
We're going to dismember him.
Bleed him dry.

420
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,360
Really?.

421
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,880
Is that what you're going to do?.

422
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,200
Old gods on new streets.

423
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,040
Not only had the concert sold out
among the living...

424
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,240
...it seemed all the undead
were coming too.

425
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,200
There would be angry vampires
out there...

426
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,360
...frightened of the light I was
directing on all our kind.

427
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:24,000
Do you have anything to say
to the other vampires ?

428
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,840
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

429
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,040
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

430
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,720
They wanted me dead.

431
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,520
Let them try.

432
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,280
Bring it on.

433
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,360
Better dead than alone.

434
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,840
Hey, honey. Want tickets for tomorrow?.

435
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,760
-Going to the show?.
-No.

436
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,520
-Come on, I got them for $200.
- $200?. ! I don' t think so.

437
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:10,360
-What if I say 1 50?.
-1 50?. You're gonna cut me a deal?.

438
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,560
So, listen, just two girls, okay?.
So how old are you again?.

439
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,560
-Check it out. Champagne?.
-Yeah.

440
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,920
Oh, my God, I can't believe
it's really you! I'm your biggest fan.

441
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,240
Boo.

442
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,400
Boo back.

443
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,800
Lestat, I came all the way
from Tarzana.

444
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,040
Really?.

445
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,560
-And you?.
-London.

446
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,240
A London Goth. I see.

447
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,840
It's funny, I would have pegged you
for a Talamascan.

448
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,600
Maybe in another life.

449
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,320
I'm an Episcopalian.

450
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,160
And I'm a frigging Buddhist.
Lestat....

451
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,480
Roger, would you take our little
Episcopalian back to church?.

452
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,080
Just the one tonight?. Sure.

453
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,400
-Sweetheart, come on.
-What?.

454
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,640
-Come on.
-What?. !

455
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,840
-It's a good thing.
-Can I still go backstage?.

456
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,000
Why are you following me?.

457
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,600
What do you want?.

458
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,680
So you come all this way
just to return this to me?.

459
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,720
Out of the goodness of your heart?.

460
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,840
I want you to show me what it's like.

461
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,240
What what is like, exactly?.

462
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,480
T o be like you.

463
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
I don't have time for this.

464
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,840
-All a vampire has is time.
-Not this one.

465
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,880
Right.

466
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,680
The covens are coming for you.

467
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,360
How are you going to spend your last
night, as you always have, alone?.

468
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,720
Why not?.

469
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,680
Why not share it with me?.

470
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,840
All right.

471
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,720
This may be painful for a mortal.

472
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,920
You're still attached to your skin.

473
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,600
I don't care.

474
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,800
Do you trust me?.

475
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,880
Yes.

476
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,920
Then close your eyes.

477
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,080
Marius was right.

478
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,280
But I never understood
until I met you.

479
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,800
What do you mean?.

480
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,200
You're beautiful to me
because you're human.

481
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,440
Your frailty...

482
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,560
...your short years...

483
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,480
...your heart...

484
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,400
...even as you think it's breaking.

485
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,320
All that...

486
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,160
...seems suddenly more precious
than anything I have ever known.

487
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm not as precious as you think.

488
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,440
Do it.

489
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,320
Please.

490
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,480
Let me be with you.

491
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,160
Let me know everything.

492
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,360
You want to know everything?.

493
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,920
Come, then.

494
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,920
I'll show you.

495
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,840
What is it?. What are we doing--?.

496
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,280
Is she all right?.

497
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,480
Get away! Get off me!

498
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,400
Now you see?.

499
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,280
Are you ready?.

500
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,120
Now do you want it, huh?.

501
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,160
No.

502
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,160
Of course you don't.

503
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,680
They're pretty worked-up.
How you feeling?.

504
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,520
Hey, girls, come on!

505
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,760
Okay, through here. Let him through!

506
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,520
Back off, fella!

507
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,120
Come on, children.

508
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,360
Okay, guys. Come on!

509
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,520
Let him through.

510
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,200
Jesse!

511
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,920
Jesse!

512
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,080
Hello, David.

513
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,320
I must show you my new
paintings sometime.

514
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,760
Find Jesse.

515
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,120
You want more?.

516
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,600
This one's for those
who've come for me.

517
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,240
Akasha.

518
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,560
Akasha?. !

519
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,640
Why so surprised, my love?.

520
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,360
You called, I have come.

521
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,440
My love?.

522
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,360
Never fear me, Lestat.

523
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,520
All your wishes have come true.

524
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,280
My wishes?.

525
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,840
For a companion to share eternity.

526
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,000
You're bold, like your music.

527
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,520
You live your life in the open,
like I did long ago...

528
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,360
...when I had a king.

529
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,960
Had a king?.

530
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,000
He's no more.

531
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,040
Now you are my consort.

532
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,080
That's why I kept you safe.

533
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,640
Alive.

534
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,040
You?.

535
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,400
You thought it was all you?.

536
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,320
The ego of a king as well.

537
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,960
Yes.

538
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,400
I know you, Lestat.

539
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,680
I know that you crave to have
the world at your feet.

540
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:43,440
And I have come to give it to you.

541
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,200
Where are we?.

542
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,880
We are home.

543
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:55,440
We live everywhere
and anywhere we choose.

544
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,400
The world is our garden.

545
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:22,240
All these years I'd hoped
this place was real.

546
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:29,440
For the first time in my life,
I feel like I'm home.

547
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,880
Strange that this journey
should lead me here.

548
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,200
This place that's haunted my dreams.

549
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,080
Aunt, you're bleeding.

550
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,400
You must be with your own.

551
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,320
I'll always be watching over you.

552
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,160
I want to stay with you forever.

553
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,680
Forever is a very long time.

554
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,480
Aunt Maharet.

555
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,520
You haven't aged,
you haven' t changed at all.

556
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,600
I was once a mortal too.

557
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,880
I bore a child before Akasha took me.
I took care of that child...

558
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,560
...and her children,
and her children's children.

559
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,280
This is our family.

560
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,880
My way of coping with eternity.

561
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,480
You are what keeps me connected
to the world of the living.

562
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:46,080
When your parents died, I brought
you here to take care of you.

563
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,040
Now is not the time.

564
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,000
You were seeking answers
and now you've found them.

565
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,960
The family is who you are.

566
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:34,240
Drinking my blood allows you
to live in the light.

567
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,160
And soon the sun will no longer
sting your eyes.

568
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,600
This is but a taste
of what we shall share, my love.

569
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,360
My king...

570
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,920
...behold our kingdom.

571
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,800
A kingdom of corpses?.

572
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,000
-Why?.
-Why not?.

573
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,360
This is why you have risen?.

574
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,720
They believed in nothing.

575
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,600
Now they are nothing.

576
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,960
But you and l,
we will change all that.

577
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,640
We will give the world something
to believe in again.

578
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,760
Now come, my love.

579
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,120
We have a score to settle.

580
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,280
Since my mortal death,
I have watched...

581
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,080
...l have guided and cared
for my human family...

582
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,360
...generations beyond memory.

583
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,880
This is why we must fight Akasha.

584
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,800
-For the sake of your great family.
-The world we know is about to end.

585
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,920
The only way to prevent this
is through Akasha's destruction.

586
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,560
But how?.

587
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,680
When she gives blood,
she's vulnerable.

588
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,560
Whoever takes the last of her blood
will not survive it.

589
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,360
What about Lestat?.

590
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:21,240
Lestat has joined with Akasha.
He's lost to us now. Forget him.

591
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,520
My children.

592
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,560
It warms my blood
to see you all gathered...

593
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,600
...plotting against me.

594
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,120
-Akasha.
-Maharet.

595
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,520
-You will address my king first.
-Lestat, what has she done to you?.

596
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,440
Lestat, step aside.

597
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,880
Never.

598
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,640
The world has changed
since you reigned.

599
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,880
Then we shall change it back.

600
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,280
Humans are animals...

601
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,800
...brute creatures.

602
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
-Their destruction can only make sense.
-We've found other ways to coexist.

603
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,400
In silence! In shadows and shame!
And for what?.

604
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,520
For respect of mortals?.

605
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,760
They are nothing to us.

606
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,680
They are merely food.

607
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,840
Akasha, please....

608
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,920
You think you can change my will?.

609
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,440
I've had enough of this discussion.

610
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,120
Join me or die.

611
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,160
I will not.

612
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,080
-I will not.
-I will not.

613
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,720
I will not.

614
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,960
Do you love me?.

615
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,400
-Yes.
-Then prove it.

616
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,800
Kill her.

617
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,800
-She's nothing to me.
-Just the same...

618
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,000
...I'd like for you to kill her.

619
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:20,520
-You will not touch her!
-You still think to challenge me?. !

620
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:27,520
-Now.
-No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.

621
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,200
It's what I want.

622
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,400
How sweet.

623
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,840
I'm ready.

624
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,480
See, my children?.

625
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,120
Remember your real family!

626
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,960
Or join hers.

627
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,640
Now...

628
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,240
...give me my crown.

629
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,960
Spoken like a true king.

630
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,560
Come.

631
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,560
You see how he obeys?.

632
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,280
You will...

633
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,720
...or you will all die.

634
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,000
That is enough, Lestat.

635
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,360
That is enough, Lestat! Stop!

636
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,080
You kill me...

637
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,160
...you kill yourselves.

638
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,120
Wait, Lestat.

639
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,200
You must stop.

640
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,920
She drank Akasha's last drop.

641
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:36,000
She took Akasha's death into herself.

642
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,840
She's not dead.

643
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,840
She sleeps.

644
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,480
Hello?.

645
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,640
Oh, my God!

646
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,840
Jesse?.

647
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,400
Hello, David.

648
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,600
David, this is Lestat.

649
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,040
-Hello.
-I have something for you.

650
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,440
I believe...

651
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,320
...that you wanted this back.

652
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,960
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.

653
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,640
-Can I ask--?.
-What's it like?.

654
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,400
Do you want to find out?.

655
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,800
Me?.

656
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,520
No, I'm too old to live forever.

657
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,600
Well, if you ever change your mind....

658
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,080
So this is goodbye.

659
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,280
Yes.

660
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,000
Hello, David.
