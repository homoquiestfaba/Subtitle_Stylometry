00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,088
 -Hey, how's it going?
 -(GASPS) Oh, my God. Did you just talk?

2
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:22,756
 -l did.
 -Are you one of those frogs

3
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,841
 that'll turn into a prince if I kiss you?

4
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:27,970
 Why don't you kiss me
 and see for yourself?

5
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,472
 You're still a frog.

6
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:32,432
 Yeah, you also have to
 reach one hand under me

7
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,893
 and lightly touch
 the underside of my penis.

8
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:37,312
 -What?
 -You have to reach one hand under...

9
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:40,441
 No, no, no. I know what you said,
 but I've just never heard that part.

10
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:44,068
 -Well, you have now.
 -So I just

11
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:46,029
 -lightly touch...
 -The underside of my penis, yeah.

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,158
 Oh. Okay.

13
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:54,120
 -Nothing's happening.
 -What do you mean?

14
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:57,249
 -You're not turning into a prince.
 -I'm not a prince.

15
00:00:57,374 --> 00:00:59,417
 -But you told me you were.
 -l did not.

16
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:00,876
 -Yes, you did.
 -l did not.

17
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:03,337
 You said I was,
 and I just didn't bother to correct you.

18
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:05,506
 So, what are you?

19
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:07,842
 (LAUGHING) I'm just a frog
 looking to get some wood, man,

20
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:10,971
 and mission accomplished.
 Thank you very much.

21
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:13,639
 -You're a sick pervert.
 -Yeah, well, I'm the one with the boner,

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,974
 -so jackpot for me. You lose.
 -You're a bastard.

23
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,227
 Well, take a hike then.

24
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:21,188
 -Hey, there.
 -(GASPS) A frog prince.

25
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,648
 I'm supposed to kiss you, right?

26
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,777
 No, actually, you're supposed
 to take a dump on my back.

27
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,497
 Oh, Tootsie, no. What are you doing?

28
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,583
 You think you're fooling them
 with that wig, but they're gonna find out.

29
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,418
 They're gonna find out, and then what?

30
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:46,547
 Then the shit hits the fan, doesn't it?
 You're not using your brain.

31
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:53,219
 Oh, Kermit, what are you doing?

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,348
 You can't get to Hollywood
 in that old Studebaker.

33
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:59,560
 Besides, you're a puppet. They're not
 going to listen to a puppet in Hollywood.

34
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:03,187
 Oh, don't stop
 and pick up those other puppets,

35
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:06,316
 there's no room for them in the car.
 You're not using your brain.

36
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:13,782
 Oh, Bender, what are you doing?
 Don't talk back to the principal.

37
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:17,201
 He's just gonna make you come back
 next Saturday.

38
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:20,329
 Just keep your mouth... You did it!
 You talked back to him.

39
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,458
 Now you're gonna get more detention...
 You did it again.

40
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,627
 You got another. What's wrong with you?
 That's another!

41
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:28,545
 Stop it! You got one more!

42
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:31,674
 You stupid bastard.
 You're not using your brain.

43
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:37,930
 Oh, Marty, what are you doing?
 Don't be hanging around that old man.

44
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:41,141
 His crazy inventions are just
 gonna get you into trouble...

45
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:44,270
 Don't get in the DeLorean.
 He just told you it's a time machine.

46
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:48,315
 Now you're gonna go back to the '50s
 and fuck up your parents' lives.

47
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:49,983
 And you'd know that,
 if you were using your brain,

48
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,112
 but you're not, are you?
 You're not using your brain.

49
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,350
 -Hello.
 -Hi.

50
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,477
 What's that you're reading?

51
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:29,438
 I'm just reading this L.A. Times piece
 on campaign reform.

52
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,647
 Oh.

53
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:33,192
 -Where are you flying to?
 -Africa.

54
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,611
 -You live there?
 -Yeah, I was just here for the holidays,

55
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:38,740
 -and now I'm heading back home.
 -Cool. What do you do there?

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,619
 Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I really
 would kind of just like to read this article.

57
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:45,829
 -No, sure. Yeah. No, that's...
 -I'm just not much of a talker.

58
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,958
 Yeah, no...
 I was just asking what you do for a living.

59
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:53,671
 I peel bananas with my feet,
 I pick bugs off my friends' backs,

60
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,550
 -and that's pretty much it.
 -l bet that's really interesting.

61
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:01,679
 -No, not really.
 -So, if you're ever in town again,

62
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:05,141
 would you, maybe, want to go get a
 drink with me or something? See a movie?

63
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,726
 Well, I don't really know
 when that would be.

64
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,478
 I don't get to the States that often.

65
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,271
 -Oh.
 -Yeah.

66
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:14,565
 Well, would you want
 to have sex with me now, then?

67
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:17,151
 Now you're talking.

68
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:20,280
 (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

69
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,415
 -That was awesome.
 -l know.

70
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,042
 -l mean, really.
 -You were so giving.

71
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:34,418
 -Oh, well.
 -So unselfish.

72
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,128
 -You make it easy.
 -I'm blushing.

73
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:38,088
 (CHUCKLES) Really? I don't see it.

74
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:41,175
 No, it's only on my balls.
 I blush with my balls.

75
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:42,843
 -Wow.
 -Yeah.

76
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,386
 -Weird.
 -Hey, listen.

77
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,930
 -There's something you should know.
 -What's that?

78
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:50,059
 I have this disease that kind of makes
 your immune system sort of go away.

79
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:54,020
 Oh.

80
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:56,398
 Yeah, it's probably nothing,
 but I just thought I should tell you.

81
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,816
 Okay.

82
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:00,652
 -Otherwise I am clean as a whistle.
 -Great.

83
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:02,404
 Hey, thanks for
 not making me wear a condom.

84
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,155
 -Yeah, no problem.
 -Wanna go again?

85
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:07,284
 Let's pound it, brother.

86
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,918
 Now, if you'll turn to page three in your
 packets, we'll go over fiscal projections.

87
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:19,880
 I'm pleased to announce a 32% increase
 in profit for the fourth quarter,

88
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:24,343
 as well as a 16% rise in yearly revenue
 at all subsidiaries.

89
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:28,472
 This is despite heightened competition
 and higher labor costs.

90
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:32,142
 Compound percent yield, of course,
 assumes reinvested interest.

91
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:35,312
 Now, value-oriented stocks appear to be
 attractive prospects once again,

92
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:39,273
 and quite able
 to generate a healthy cash flow

93
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:42,402
 and give investors
 a reassuring margin of safety.

94
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:45,029
 Although the market is
 far from where it was six years ago,

95
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,906
 we're looking anew
 at value stocks and mutual funds

96
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:51,035
 that hold value-oriented shares,
 which tend to have a low price-to-earnings

97
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:55,165
 or price-to-book ratios,
 or high yields from dividends.

98
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:58,542
 In fact, value stocks have performed
 better than growth stocks

99
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:01,628
 over the past several years
 among the larger corporations

100
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,757
 and the long-term compound appreciation
 is quite impressive.

101
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,927

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:09,511

103
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:12,640

107
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,864
 Come on, you.

108
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:32,993
 We are gathered here today
 to ask the blessing of the Lord, our God,

109
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:36,830
 for this union of Mark and Stephanie.

110
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,333
 Well, that's good enough for me.
 It's been great, Steph.

111
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,500
 Same here, good luck.

112
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,960
 -Best to the family.
 -Yours, too.

113
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,963
 -l mean, this is pretty clear, right?
 -Yes. That's God's shit.

114
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:49,092
 Right, yeah. Okay, thanks, everyone.

115
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:59,686
 All right, here's one. So, a horse walks
 into a bar and the bartender says,

116
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:01,895
 "Why the long face?"

117
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,313
 (BOTH LAUGHING)

118
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:06,442
 -That's hilarious.
 -Hey. Fuck you.

119
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:08,485
 -Whoa !
 -What the hell's your problem?

120
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,737
 You're my problem, dude.
 That joke is offensive.

121
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:12,489
 -Yeah?
 -Yeah. I'm sorry that not everyone

122
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,450
 conforms to your preconceived notions
 of attractiveness.

123
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:18,579
 -It's a joke, man.
 -Oh. Yeah? It's a joke? How about this?

124
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:21,039
 Why are there
 so few black baseball players?

125
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,041
 -Why?
 -Because they're always stealing bases.

126
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,584
 (LAUGHING)

127
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:27,462
 -Whoa ! Hey, now that is offensive.
 -Yeah, what the hell, man?

128
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,672
 -Hey, it's a joke, man.
 -Yeah, but it's racist.

129
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:32,675
 The horse with the long face
 just told a racist joke, huh?

130
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:34,385
 -That's different.
 -Yeah, how's it different?

131
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:37,514
 Hey, why do you have so many drinks
 and you haven't touched any of them?

132
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,768
 Hello, Einstein, hooves.
 No fucking thumbs, can't pick up a glass.

133
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:44,187
 -Well, then, why are you in a bar?
 -Eat shit, that's why. Dickhead.

134
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:46,731
 Look, look. I think we all
 got off on the wrong foot here.

 -Yeah, well, you got that right.
 -We're sorry, okay?

 who has advanced
 to the Glory Hole Round,

 which means
 we're gonna stick a live animal's penis

 through that hole over there.

144
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:17,803
 And if you can guess
 what type of animal it belongs to,

 you're gonna win $100,000. Are you ready?

146
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,517
 I'm ready to name that animal penis, Bob.

147

 -Wow.
 -That sure is an animal penis.

150
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:35,321
 -l can smell it from here.
 -Are you ready to identify it?

 -Talk it out.

 Well, it looks like some kind of
 large jungle cat, but I'm not really sure.

 You still have a lifeline.
 Would you like to use it?

 is brown and purple,

328
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,763
 Hey, dragon. You can have her.

329
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,818
 Michael, this isn't going to be easy,
 but you're a grown man now

330
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,945
 and your mother and I feel
 you deserve to know the truth.

331
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,074
 -l don't understand, Dad.
 -Michael, you're not our biological son.

332
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:21,784
 (GASPS)

333
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,244
 -What?
 -You were adopted.

334
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,663
 Oh, my... Oh, my God.

335
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,750
 Your mother and I felt
 it was wrong to conceive a new child

336
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,960
 with so many unwanted children
 in the world already.

337
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:35,047
 Baby, we're sorry
 we didn't tell you sooner. We just...

338
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,176
 We wanted to wait until you were mature
 and able to handle the knowledge.

339
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:41,637
 Oh, my gosh. My head is spinning.

340
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,264
 To be honest, we were always afraid
 you'd figure it out for yourself,

341
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:45,807
 based on little obvious things.

342
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,936
 I mean, we all have such dark hair,
 and your hair is blond.

343
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:52,272
 The rest of the family has brown eyes
 and yours are blue.

344
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:55,401
 And as your fair complexion... I mean,
 none of us have freckles like you do.

345
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:58,444
 That's right. And you're a good deal taller
 than either your mother or l,

346
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:01,574
 and your nipples don't stick out 5 feet
 in front of you like the rest of the family.

347
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:04,952
 But we always loved you
 as if you were our very own,

348
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:08,205
 -and we still do, Michael.
 -Actually, that's another thing, your name.

349
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:12,209
 -What about my name?
 -Your real name isn't Michael Sticknipples.

350
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:14,877
 -It's not?
 -No.

351
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:17,755
 Your birth name is Albert Shitsneeze.

352
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:20,800
 -This is so much to process.
 -l know. I know it is, dear.

353
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:23,929
 -We understand if you're upset with us.
 -No, I'm not. I mean,

354
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:27,766
 I don't know. Maybe a little.
 I just... I don't really understand.

355
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,684
 (SNEEZES)

356
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:33,813
 I don't understand why you felt
 like I wouldn't be able to handle this.

357
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:37,150
 I mean, I love you guys. You raised me.

358
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,860
 As far as I'm concerned,
 you're my parents.

359
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,989
 Albert, we love you, too.

360
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:46,451
 -Do I have a middle name?
 -Yes, you're Albert Horsefeet Shitsneeze.

361
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:50,329
 (Neighing)

362
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:59,129
 Hey, you know, being out on this ocean

363
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,173
 reminds me
 of when we were filming U-571.

364
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,967
 You familiar with that picture?
 It's a submarine picture.

365
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:06,094
 I spent a lot of time in the water for that.

366
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:09,223
 You know, I also made a movie called
 Fool's Gold, me and Kate Hudson.

367
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:12,767
 We had a contest to see
 who could get more tanned.

368
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:15,603
 I won, of course,
 but still it was a great contest.

369
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:18,314
 You know, the last time I was on water
 in a ship scenario,

370
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:21,443
 I was making a little picture
 by a man named Steven Spielberg,

371
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:24,028
 up and coming director.
 You might have heard of him.

372
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,031
 It's a film called Amistad,
 a historical picture.

373
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:30,160
 Flexed my acting chops, as it were.
 Not quite the way I did in We Are Marshall.

374
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:32,244
 Did you see that face I made? It was like...

375
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:33,370
 (GRUNTING)

376
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:36,373
 (LAUGHING) I was making faces
 like a real guy. There was a guy,

377
00:21:36,374 --> 00:21:39,502
 he really looked like that, so I thought
 l'd impersonate him in the face.

378
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,547
 I'm just such a good actor.

379
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:46,300
 That's what you need to do, friend,
 to keep yourself alive.

380
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:48,760
 You can take the meat of my body.
 l'll be Christ-like on you.

381
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,890
 You can taste my body
 and drink my blood.

382
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:54,099
 You know, the best thing
 about having one leg

383
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,228
 is probably all the cinematic opportunities
 for me. I'm more of a character actor.

384
00:21:58,354 --> 00:22:00,230
 Everybody always heralds me
 as a beautiful man.

385
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:03,359
 They say, "Oh, Matt, your body.
 Oh, Matt, your glorious face,

386
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,862
 "your physique, your flowing hair,
 your gigantic penis,

387
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:09,739
 "your fantastic ass..." You know.

388
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,616
 I want people to look at me
 more as a character.

389
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:14,369
 Sort of like Jared Leto
 doing that Mark David Chapman role.

390
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,413
 He put on all that weight for it.
 That was impressive. Pretty boy.

391
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:20,333
 (GROANS) That is probably
 a near fatal wound.

392
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,502
 That's the kind of thing that
 a person would bleed out from.

393
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:24,337
 You know, in the obit,
 it would probably say,

394
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:27,466
 "Handsome movie star,
 hunk Matthew McConaughey

395
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,634
 "died of a fatal stab wound

396
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:32,763
 "that barely was able to pierce
 his metal-like abdominal muscles."

397
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:36,975
 Nice thing is, I imagine,
 at my funeral they will talk about me.

398
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:41,021
 In reverence at my memorial service,
 they'll go over all my great works

399
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:44,274
 starting at Dazed and Confused
 and running right up to Sahara.

400
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:49,821
 All the wonderful things I've done
 in my life. It would be a good time.

401
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:52,489
 I wish I could be there,
 'cause that's a story l'd like to hear,

402
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,241
 the story of Matthew...

 Hey, ladies, you like night club?

405
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,218
 We go to night club, buy champagne,
 drink from bottle.

 -Just get in sports car.
 -Yeah, get in sports car.

 -No thanks, guys.
 -Okay, okay. What you like then?

 walk them in the park,

 Just get in sports car.

 -Yeah, get in sports car.
 -Seriously, we're not interested.

 -Look, we're not getting in your sports car.

 -Now leave us alone.
 -Ahmed, look.

 Okay.

 and we play radio loud.

 -Just get in sports car.
 -Yeah, get in sports car.

 from now on.

 take a dump on my lawn
 last week, asshole.

 a glass house shouldn't throw stones.

 -Yeah.

 with a machine gun turret on the roof?

 he who lives in a glass house

 with a fucking machine gun turret
 on the roof

439
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,196

 all the goddamn stones he wants.

 Hey, let me ask you something.

444
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:08,872
 Why shouldn't he who lives
 in a glass house throw stones?

445
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:12,001
 Well, because people can throw stones
 back at him and then destroy his house.

446
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:14,920
 Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

447
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:17,839
 I can see why he who lives in a glass house
 should be cautious.

448
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,383
 You know, except if he who lives
 in a glass house

 Your kid's a fucking super Jew, okay?

488
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,780
 All right, now who wants the foreskin?

489
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:53,909
 Hey, Quentin. I thought I heard somebody
 giving away some foreskin.

490
00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:57,163
 May I take it?

491
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:06,504
 Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa !

492
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:08,214
 Uh-uh. Bro, can't let you in.

493
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:09,590
 What? Why not?

494
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:12,426
 This is Les Deux.
 This is a very exclusive club.

495

 -Look, we'll buy drinks.
 -No. Sorry, bro.

496
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,683
 -Hey, what the hell?
 -Yeah, what the hell was that?

497
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:22,394
 -Why'd they get to go in?
 -Because they're chicks.

498
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:24,855
 -You got any chicks with you?
 -Our wives are at home.

499
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:27,483
 Yeah, this is sort of a boys' night out.

500
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:30,194
 -Well, go party somewhere else, dude.
 -What?

501
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:32,363
 I said go party somewhere else.

502
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:35,115
 Hey, what the fuck is your problem, dude?

503
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:38,244
 You. You're my problem. There's no way
 I'm letting you in here, asshole.

504
00:28:38,495 --> 00:28:40,662
 This club is for hot, young,
 hip party people.

505
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:42,497
 -We're hip.
 -No, you're not.

506
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:45,042
 Look at you. You're the most
 out-of-date looking douchebags

507
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:46,626

508

 What are those,
 fucking animal skins you're wearing?

509
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:51,339
 Well, look at what you're wearing,
 dickhead.

510
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,468
 Nice wool hat. And sunglasses at night.

511
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:57,930
 -Yeah, that's not too fucking affected.
 -Get out of here.

512
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,768
 -Hello, dum-dums.
 -Oh, come on!

 helping us, Mr. Wizard.

514
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:16,240
 Not at all, my dear child, not at all.
 Now what is it you would like, Scarecrow?

515
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:20,536
 -l'd like a brain.
 -Well, I think we can arrange that.

516
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:24,957
 -Here it is.
 -Jesus! What? ls that a human brain?

517
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:28,627
 Sure is. This was removed from
 a hospital patient who died of liver cancer.

518
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:32,129
 He was a donor,
 so we really lucked out here.

519
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,881
 Now, if you'll just make your way
 to the operating room,

520
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:37,010
 our team of surgeons will go ahead
 and begin the procedure.

521
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:39,470
 Now, what can I do for you, Tin Man?

522
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:42,431
 -l'd like a heart.
 -All right.

523
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,599
 (Exclaims)

524
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,226
 -Oh, my God!
 -Yeah, look at that, eh?

525
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:47,978
 -That's a human heart!
 -No, it's not.

526
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:49,813
 This came out of a gibbous monkey.

527
00:29:49,814 --> 00:29:52,691
 It was housed in an artificial habitat
 at the zoo and turns out

528
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:55,736
 some kid climbed into the pen,
 the monkey ripped off both his arms

529
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:57,946
 and started eating them,
 so they had to shoot it.

530
00:29:57,947 --> 00:29:59,489
 Managed to save the heart, though.

531
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,117
 Should be relatively compatible,
 very low risk of rejection,

532
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:04,869
 so if you're ready,
 the surgeons will get started.

533
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,788
 All right, Lion, what is it you'd like?

534
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:09,917
 -l'd like some courage.
 -Okay.

535
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:11,918
 (Exclaims)

536
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,336
 Yeah, it's a beauty, isn't it?

537
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:16,465
 Wholly undamaged,
 surgically extracted human spine.

538
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:18,883
 You'll be courageous as hell
 with this thing inside you.

539
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,718
 All set?

540
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:23,847
 Well, what about me, Mr. Wizard?
 Can you get me back to Kansas?

541
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:27,267
 No, that's gonna be a tall order. But what
 I can do is make Oz more like Kansas.

542
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:31,228
 I've abolished all scientific research
 of any kind,

543
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,231
 instituted mandatory Bible study
 and church service attendance

544
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,361
 seven days a week, forbidden the teaching
 of evolution in public schools,

545
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,904

 for you to beat this gay guy.

546
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:43,033
 Hi, there. Well, go on, get to it.
 I'm not gonna beat myself.

547
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:46,494
 Or maybe I am. Welcome to Oz, bitch!

548
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:56,421
 Dad, today at school, my teacher said
 we evolved from other animals.

549
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,756
 -That's not true, is it?
 -Of course not, Steven.

550
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,551
 We were created by Monkey God
 in his monkey image.

551
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:04,636
 But how do we know for sure
 God's a monkey?

552
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:06,721
 Well, do you think God throws
 his own poop

553
00:31:06,722 --> 00:31:09,474
 -and enjoys jumping up and down in place?
 -Yeah.

554
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:12,435
 And do you think when he's eating
 bananas, he periodically stops chewing

555
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:14,604
 and looks around with an angry expression
 to make sure

556
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,648
 -no one's plotting to steal them?
 -Yeah.

557
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:19,777
 And do you think his ass is slightly
 less hairy than the rest of his body?

558
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,153
 -Yeah.
 -Then there's your answer, champ.

559
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:24,989
 Okay, but how do we know
 God really loves us?

560
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,575
 Because his son died for our sins.

561
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:29,911
 Monkey Jesus could've ripped off
 the Romans' arms

562
00:31:29,912 --> 00:31:33,040
 and masturbated all over their bodies,
 but he chose love instead.

563
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:36,834
 And I think that makes him
 pretty darn special.

564
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:39,545
 Cool. Thanks, Dad.

565
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:42,674
 -How's our son doing?
 -He's gonna be okay, Paula.

566
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:45,969
 He's gonna be okay.

567
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,727
 That's it!
 I can't live like this anymore, Jim.

568
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:57,062
 You keep putting up walls between us.

569

 I mean, why, Jim? Why do you do that?

570
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,860
 Okay, still have nothing to say?

 an actual physical apple in your hand.

603
00:34:57,614 --> 00:35:00,742
 Health officials have reported a new
 outbreak of Mad Cow Disease

604
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:03,327
 which has surfaced within
 the past four days,

605
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:06,456
 prompting a massive recall on all
 beef products for the entire area.

606
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,584
 Mad Cow Disease occurs as a result
 of cattle farmers

607
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:13,420
 using beef products to round out
 their cows' food.

608
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:16,550
 Consumption by cattle of beef products
 causes an imbalance in body chemistry

609
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:21,012
 which causes them to, in effect, go insane.

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,146
 -She's always got the thing
 -She's always got the thing

650
00:37:39,147 --> 00:37:41,106
 -To turn it upside down
 -To turn it upside down

651
00:37:41,107 --> 00:37:42,441
 -'Cause my gal's pussy
 -'Cause my gal's pussy

652
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:44,318
 -Is the smallest in town
 -Is the smallest in town

653
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:47,447
 She's got a face without a trace of gloom
 I guarantee it

654
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:50,867
 Her muff is sweet and so petite
 You have to squint your eyes to see it

655
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:54,202
 -I'm such a happy fellow
 -I'm such a happy fellow

656
00:37:54,203 --> 00:37:56,121
 -When she comes around
 -When she comes around

00:37:56,122 --> 00:37:57,455

00:37:57,457 --> 00:37:59,416

00:38:04,255 --> 00:38:07,383

00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:15,349
 -Smallbush

664
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:23,357
 Hey, beaver,
 what the hell are you doing to my river?

665
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:25,107
 l'll die with that thing there.

666
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:28,236
 Yeah. And l'll die without
 a sweet-ass bachelor pad on the water.

667
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:29,528
 Deal with it, broham.

668
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:31,739
 Hey, beaver, did you eat this tree?

669
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,908
 There was a knot right here
 with my nest in it.

670
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:36,118
 Yeah. I used that wood
 for my steam room.

671
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,913
 Now I get to rub my nuts
 all over your house, biatch.

672
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:41,207
 Hey, did you borrow my DVD
 of The Departed?

673
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,917
 -'Cause it's all scratched now.
 -Hey, I did you a favor, man.

674
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:46,170
 Want to see a good movie?
 Try Rush Hour 3.

675
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:48,547
 Chris Tucker fucking cracks my shit up.

676
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:51,216
 -God! Can you believe this guy? What a...
 -A vagina.

677
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:54,345
 Yeah, a vagina.
 From now on, beaver means vagina.

678
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:56,346
 -Yeah.
 -Yeah.

679
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:59,224
 And that is the origin of the term.

680
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:02,353
 Join me next week when l'll tell you
 how the bear became synonymous

681
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:06,023
 with the chubby homosexual.

682
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:14,572
 It's nice to meet you, Abby.
 What brings you here?

683
00:39:14,573 --> 00:39:17,701
 This is kind of hard to talk about.
 I've never even said it out loud before,

684
00:39:19,036 --> 00:39:21,246
 -but I'm bulimic.
 -l see.

685
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:24,375
 l'll just binge like crazy,
 just stuffing my face.

686
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,795
 A steak burrito, a stack of pancakes,
 a loaf of French bread with mayonnaise,

687
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:33,509
 garbage bag full of popcorn,
 a ham sandwich with marshmallow fluff,

688
00:39:34,092 --> 00:39:35,676
 -and crushed-up Doritos.
 -Mmm-hmm.

689
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:38,805
 And then after I'm done, I just feel terrible
 and disgusting and ugly, so l...

690
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:43,267
 -You purge?
 -What?

691
00:39:43,268 --> 00:39:46,396
 -What's "

692
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:49,148
 No, I cry. Why would I throw up?

693
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:52,277
 Well, that's what bulimia is.
 You binge and then you purge.

694
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:54,903
 Yeah, I don't throw up. That's really gross.

695
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:58,033
 Okay, well,
 then l'd have to say you're not bulimic.

696
00:39:58,324 --> 00:40:01,453
 Really? God, that is such a relief.

697
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,870
 -So, I'm just...
 -Fat.

698
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:07,000
 Fat? Okay. Great.

699
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,338
 (LAUGHING) God! I was so worried.
 You are a really good psychiatrist.

700
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:17,635
 Wow! I mean, I don't know
 if this is appropriate, but would you

701
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:19,803
 maybe like to go out sometime? Or...

702
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:22,931
 No, thanks. I don't date fat chicks. Sorry.

703
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:26,060
 -That's okay.
 -Good.

704
00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:35,027
 You poor crippled man.
 How did this unfortunate fate befall you?

705
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:39,323
 I was injured while building a house
 for my family.

706
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:42,491
 You pitiable fellow.
 If only there was some help for you.

707
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:43,951
 (GASPS)

708
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:47,080
 The messiah will help you. O Lord Jesus,
 will you heal this man's wound?

709
00:40:49,624 --> 00:40:52,753
 Oh, man, l'll tell you what, somebody
 ought to heal this acid reflux, man.

710
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:56,380
 This shit is fucking up my day.

711
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:59,509
 O Lord, won't you please
 perform a miracle for this man?

712
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:01,468
 You know what would be a miracle?

713
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:04,597
 If I could go back in time three hours
 and say to myself,

714
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,767
 "

715
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:09,726
 I guess that's not gonna happen, huh?

716
00:41:09,727 --> 00:41:12,563
 He will surely die without you, O Lord.

717
00:41:12,564 --> 00:41:15,692
 Yeah, before that, I gotta ask, does
 anybody have any Pepcid or anything,

718
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:19,237
 so I can settle this fucking cauldron
 of shit in my stomach?

719
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:22,155
 I swear to God,
 l'd give everything I have right now

720
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:25,284
 just for a goddamned powerhouse round
 of diarrhea.

721
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:28,579
 ls there no hope for this poor man?
 Won't you give him your healing touch?

722
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:31,790
 l'll give him something better, advice.

723
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:34,459
 Don't mix Pete's Wicked Ale
 with A1 Sauce,

724
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,588
 unless you want a fucking gastrointestinal
 showstopper playing out in your gut.

725
00:41:39,173 --> 00:41:42,301
 Shit, man. I envy you
 for not having to deal with this right now.

726
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:45,971
 He's dead! If only we could've saved him.

727
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,849
 l'll tell you this, he's better off that way.
 'Cause if he was alive,

728
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,894
 there'd be a chance that he could someday
 walk into Jared's Rib House,

729
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,022
 order the onion fries and hot wings,
 wash them down with a few beers,

730
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:59,151
 and then watch the fucking
 Buttcracker Suite put on in the toilet.

731
00:41:59,568 --> 00:42:02,696
 Christ! I am never eating again.

732
00:42:08,868 --> 00:42:10,119
 Mmm-mmm.

733
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,248
 Thank you, Count Dracula.
 That was delicious.

734
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:15,082
 I'm glad you enjoyed it, Magic.

735
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:18,211
 Because from now on,
 you'll have little appetite for mortal food.

736
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:20,462
 (SCREAMS)

737
00:42:20,463 --> 00:42:22,422
 (EVIL LAUGHTER)

738
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:25,258
 You don't follow the news very much,
 do you?

739
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:28,388
 No, not really. Why?

740
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:37,396
 (SNEEZES)

741
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,363
 -All right, here are the beads.
 -Thank you.

742
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,741
 And if you'll just sign this document
 giving us all of Manhattan...

743
00:42:49,742 --> 00:42:50,992
 (Sniffing)

744
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:53,578
 Wait a minute.
 Have these been in your ass?

745
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,164
 What? No. They're just ordinary beads.

746
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:59,293
 -You know, like you asked for.
 -Hey, smell these.

747
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:01,502
 Oh, yeah, these have definitely
 been in the butt.

748
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,505
 Sorry, deal's off.
 You're gonna have to find something else.

749
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:07,634
 Wow, okay.
 Still don't know what you're talking about,

750
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:12,264
 but will you take a gerbil?

751
00:43:18,645 --> 00:43:20,354
 So, let me get this straight.

752
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:23,483
 Your defense is that you shot the sheriff,
 but you did not shoot the deputy.

753
00:43:25,276 --> 00:43:27,945
 -Yeah.
 -But you did shoot the sheriff?

754
00:43:27,946 --> 00:43:30,322
 -Yeah.
 -And you're admitting that?

755
00:43:30,323 --> 00:43:31,448
 Yeah.

756
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:32,908
 We don't need to get him on the deputy.

757
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:35,744
 If we prove he killed the sheriff,
 that's a life sentence right there.

758
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:38,246
 Yeah. I'm not sure
 why he's defending himself on murder

759
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:40,415
 by confessing
 to a completely different murder.

760
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:43,544
 I have this weird hunch he might be high.

761
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,596
 JESUS: Oh, shit, look at that one.

762
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:57,724
 They must've spent like 5,000 bucks
 on all those decorations.

763
00:43:57,725 --> 00:43:59,225
 -Hey, Vishnu.
 -What?

764
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:01,310
 Where are all the decorations
 for your birthday?

765
00:44:01,312 --> 00:44:02,645
 (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

766
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:04,355
 -Very funny.
 -No, no, seriously. Where are they?

767
00:44:04,356 --> 00:44:07,484
 'Cause I see like every house in America
 has decorations up for my birthday,

768
00:44:07,526 --> 00:44:10,654
 but nothing for yours.
 Maybe they have some in India.

769
00:44:11,029 --> 00:44:14,157
 Nope, nothing there. Just some guy
 wiping his ass with his hand.

770
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:15,616
 (Sighs)

771
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:18,745
 Nah, but seriously, dude, happy birthday.

772
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:28,213
 -l am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
 -What the fuck?

773
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,258
 No, wrong house! Wrong house!

774
00:44:34,636 --> 00:44:37,596
 -What is this? This is great.
 -It's ghost.

775
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:39,931
 -l killed it myself.
 -It's really juicy.

776
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:42,309
 Yeah. l'll give you some ghost jerky
 to take home.

777
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,852
 MAN 1 : Terrific.
 MAN 2: Looking forward to that.

778
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:46,981
 -Ted, this has been great.
 -You're welcome.

779
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:56,699
 No way, Vince. We cannot do that.
 There's no way we can do that.

780
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:01,411
 Actually, Vince,
 it turns out we can do that.

781
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:04,540
 Cool.

782
00:45:10,671 --> 00:45:13,799
 -Hey, it's Tara Reid.
 -Wow, Tara, you're so beautiful.

783
00:45:14,883 --> 00:45:17,134
 And I really love the way
 your stomach looks.

784
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:20,264
 Hey, thanks, guys.

785
00:45:25,977 --> 00:45:28,687
 -Let's try some role playing.
 -Okay.

786
00:45:28,688 --> 00:45:31,816
 l'll be Judd Hirsch.

787
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,736
 I'm glad we saw National Treasure 2.

788
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:38,865
 I know. It answered every single question
 I had after seeing National Treasure 1.

789
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:45,954
 Can you help me? l'd like to buy an iPod.

790
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:49,083
 You know what's way better than an iPod?
 A Zune.

791
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:55,590
 You know, Joe Pantoliano is also quite
 gifted at playing non-Italians.

792
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:03,638
 College sucks!
 I never should have had that abortion.

793
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,599
 I mean, just think. Right now
 you could be home with a baby.

794
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,728
 I mean, how much cooler would that be?

795
00:46:12,189 --> 00:46:15,317
 You know what's really interesting?
 You talking about your zodiac sign.

796
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,531
 -Hey, can I help you?
 -Yeah.

797
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:23,908
 I'm looking to buy some new,
 interesting music.

798
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:27,037
 You know,
 you should check out Hilary Duff.

799
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,957
 No, dude. The reason everyone
 respects you so much

800
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:35,087
 is because you have a pet snake.

801
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:40,716
 Want to know why I joined
 the College Republicans?

802
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:42,843
 -The pussy.
 -l hear you, bro.

803
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:45,972
 I'm getting seven kinds of laid.

804
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:52,769
 Wow! That really busted
 all my preconceptions

805
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,855
 of West Virginians as inbred morons.

806
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:57,816
 I know.
 We met such diverse, intelligent people.

807
00:46:57,817 --> 00:47:00,945
 And very few of them breathed exclusively
 through their mouths.

808
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,207
 -How's my favorite nephew?
 -Real good. Just getting a beer.

809
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:16,961
 Mitch, can I just say
 how much I adore Janine?

810
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:20,756
 Yeah, she's great. Actually,
 we just had our one-year anniversary.

811
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:23,968
 Ooh! How nice!
 Did you do anything fun to celebrate?

812
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,011
 No. We kept it pretty low-key.

813
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:29,889
 -l took her over to Spinelli's.
 -Ooh! How lovely.

814
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,099
 Yeah. Then we pretty much
 just went home.

815
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,018
 And I think I told you how Janine and l

816
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,228
 saved a piece of our wedding cake
 in the freezer.

817
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,358
 -Oh! I like that. That's a cute idea.
 -Yeah.

818
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:42,568
 You know, it's kind of cheesy,
 but, you know, it's fun.

819
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:45,321
 And we put our own little twist on it.
 I took the piece of cake,

820
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:48,240
 and then just shoved the fucker way up
 into her pussy.

821
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:51,369
 I mean, like way up there. I'm talking like,
 if I was wearing a watch, it's gone.

822
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:54,830
 And then I just start fucking her,
 you know?

823
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,124
 Just like super fucking her, like that.

824
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,253
 Just pounded the fucking cake
 the fuck up in her, you know?

825
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,296
 -Oh, my.
 -Yeah. And then...

826
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:04,423
 And you're gonna love this.
 I take my dick out,

827
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,092
 and I make her lick the cake off my dick.
 All of it.

828
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,221
 And then I gave her a little homemade
 fucking icing, if you know what I mean.

829
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,642
 Say, Aunt Helen, why do you always wear
 that stupid scarf on your head?

830
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,603
 -l have cancer.
 -Still?

831
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,732
 Boy, that's got to be
 a fucking shitty deal, huh?

832
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,907
 You know,
 I just don't think this is that funny.

833
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,035
 I was just gonna say, neither do l.
 It's just not funny.

834
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,412
 I'm just kind of sitting here, stone-faced,
 watching things

835
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,206
 that I know I'm supposed to be laughing at.

836
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:41,335
 I agree. I don't think De Niro is that good,
 I don't think Teri Polo is that good.

837
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,212
 I'm finding myself really put off
 by Ben Stiller.

838
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,214
 Really put off, he's doing nothing for me.

839
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,343
 The whole thing feels
 very mainstream innocuous, you know?

840
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,178
 There's nothing unexpected
 about the jokes.

841
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,847
 -It's very predictable.
 -Very. I just... I don't care for it.

842
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,974
 -Neither do l.
 -l don't think we should watch the rest.

843
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,727
 I don't either. I don't really care
 what happens to these characters.

844
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,646
 -Let's shut it off.
 -l agree.

845
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:05,775
 That's much better.

846
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,660
 Hi, I'm Jeff Goldblum.
 Guess what I'm selling?

847
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:19,663
 Wrong again. Jeff Goldblum Wafers.

848
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:22,792
 The only cracker that talks
 when you put it in your mouth.

849
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:26,170
 Now, each cracker looks like
 a tiny Jeff Goldblum,

850
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:29,507
 and it makes scintillating conversation.

851
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:33,469
 ls that Brie? Oh, I love Brie.
 I once dated a girl named Brie.

852
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:36,596
 She was... She was very lithe.

853
00:49:36,597 --> 00:49:39,725
 (LAUGHING) You're...
 You're eating me. That tickles.

854
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:43,437
 Your mouth smells like black licorice.
 You know, the twisty kind?

855
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:47,316
 Now before you swallow,
 did you see No Country for Old Men?

856
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:50,861
 It was stunningly bleak, darkly intimate,
 and most of all, human.

857
00:49:52,613 --> 00:49:55,741
 Now, you see, you won't hear a Triscuit
 make that kind of conversation.

858
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:58,367
 Although they are crisp,
 l'll have to give them that.

859
00:49:58,368 --> 00:50:01,496
 They're very crispy. Where was l?
 Oh, yes, buy Jeff Goldblum Wafers.

860
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:06,292
 Or don't, but I would prefer it if you did.

861
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:09,421
 Although, let' face it,
 one can't always get what one desires.

862
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:13,466
 Still, that's no reason not to try. Yes, yes.

863
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:44,245
 (BLEATING)

864
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:46,414
 All right, everybody. It's shearing time.

865
00:50:46,415 --> 00:50:48,916
 First, I'm first. Shear me.
 I'm ready to be sheared.

866
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:51,502
 -Look, I don't wanna do this...
 -No, no, no, it's cool, man. It's cool.

867
00:50:51,503 --> 00:50:53,129
 -It's all good.
 -You're not gonna do that thing...

868
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,089
 No, I'm not gonna do that thing.
 It's fine. It's fine.

869
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:58,218
 -All right.
 -Cool.

870
00:51:00,345 --> 00:51:03,431
 Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

871
00:51:03,432 --> 00:51:06,560
 Yeah, yeah, shear it. Fucking shear me.

872
00:51:07,227 --> 00:51:09,270
 Fucking shear that goddamned shit off me.
 Fuck yeah.

873
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:10,938
 I thought you said
 you weren't gonna be doing that shit.

874
00:51:10,939 --> 00:51:12,106
 I am, I am. I'm just doing a bit.

875
00:51:12,107 --> 00:51:15,192
 I'm just doing a bit. That's all.
 It's all good, all right?

876
00:51:15,193 --> 00:51:18,321
 Okay, just go. Do it. Do it.

877
00:51:19,531 --> 00:51:22,659
 Oh, yeah. Fuck.
 Fucking shear my ass, bitch.

878
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,788
 Yeah, make me naked.
 Make me a naked fucking skin sheep.

879
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:30,624
 Yeah, run that thing all over my ass.
 Fuck, yeah!

880
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,876
 -Okay, I'm not doing this.
 -What? Come on, dude.

881
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:34,294
 -What's your problem?
 -No, I'm not going to do it.

882
00:51:34,295 --> 00:51:36,630
 -You're freaking me out.
 -You can't stop. You're like halfway done.

883
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,506
 -l don't care.
 -You can't leave me halfway sheared.

884
00:51:38,508 --> 00:51:40,175
 -Shorn.
 -Halfway shorn, you can't do that.

885
00:51:40,176 --> 00:51:42,469
 Come on, dude. Don't be a douche.

886
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,598
 -Okay, fine. But I swear to God, if you...
 -It's... I won't... I promise. Relax.

887
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,268
 -It's all good now. It's all good. All right?
 -All right.

888
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,648
 Oh, fuck! Oh, my God. Fuck, yeah.
 Fucking shear me the fuck up.

889
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:59,610
 Oh, yeah, I'm so fucking hard right now.
 Shit.

890
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:02,655
 Got a big, fucking, cotton boner.

891
00:52:02,656 --> 00:52:05,784
 Fuck me with that thing.
 Fucking, fucking shear my asshole.

892
00:52:05,868 --> 00:52:08,996
 Shear around my fucking asshole.
 Shove that fucking thing up my ass,

893
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:12,164
 stick it up my ass immediately!
 Stick me up the ass with it!

894
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:14,208
 -Shear me up the ass! Do it!
 -I'm done.

895
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:15,543
 -What?
 -I'm done.

896
00:52:15,544 --> 00:52:17,711
 -What the fuck?
 -You're not right in the head. I'm done.

897
00:52:17,712 --> 00:52:20,841
 You jerk! I thought we were friends.

898
00:52:21,716 --> 00:52:24,844
 (VOICE BREAKING)
 I thought we were friends.

899
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:09,138
 Hi. I'm Wil Wheaton.
 I know. I can't believe it either.

900
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:12,599
 Never, ever, feed a dog chocolate while
 he wears a tin foil hat in the microwave.

901
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,688
 It's just not cool.
