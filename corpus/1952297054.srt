1
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,733
Well, well, well.

2
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,308
What do we have here? A whale?

3
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,258
Oh, boy.

4
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,605
Will you get your hands off me?

5
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,123
Okay, God. All right, fine.

6
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:02,263
- What do you say, Harry?
- Hey there, Joe. How you doing?

7
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,845
Frida?

8
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,221
- Hey, Mr. Miller.
- Brian. Brian!

9
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,226
Hey, look, it's Frida.
Just got out of his acting class.

10
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,562
God damn it,
get your ass out of the car, dipshit.

11
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,467
Jeez, Dad, anger management.

12
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,600
- Hey, Frida.
- Hey, Brian.

13
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,443
Well, hey there, stranger.
When did you get back?

14
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,384
- Like, a month ago.
- A month?

15
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,183
So the hotshot Princeton girl has no time
to say hey to us island folk, huh?

16
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:54,488
He's just teasing, sweetie.
Brian, did you see Frida, honey?

17
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,627
- She's like, four feet in front of me.
- Actually,

18
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,303
I'm taking a bit of a break
from Princeton, so...

19
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,465
- Dropping out, huh?
- So, you're gonna be around?

20
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,738
- You and... We should...
- It's just a hiatus. I don't know.

21
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,507
Dad kind of needs me
at the restaurant, and...

22
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,550
Great, yeah.

23
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,813
Well, lookit, Frida, honey,

24
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,848
I've been wanting to tell you how awful
that whole mess over in Iraq is.

25
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,026
I always vote...

26
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,688
We always vote Democrat
in every election and...

27
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,993
What the hell are you talking about,
we always vote Democrat?

28
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,261
- I don't vote for no pussies.
- Joe!

29
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,133
Look, Frida's glad we're bringing
democracy to her home country.

30
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,694
Am I right, Frida?

31
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,501
Actually, I'm not from Iraq.

32
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,573
- What's that?
- I'm from right here.

33
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,013
It's my dad who's from Iran.

34
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,244
- Iran.
- Iran.

35
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:59,914
Well, I think it's just a tragedy.
All that blood for a little bit of oil.

36
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,728
You know what?
It's always a pleasure seeing you guys,

37
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,435
but I gotta get going.

38
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,997
Well, take care now, Frida.

39
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,673
- Bye, Frida.
- Say goodbye, Brian.

40
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,275
That guy doesn't like his burger.
It's not done enough.

41
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,186
They're always complaining, these people.

42
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,384
Hi.

43
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,564
How's it hanging, Mr. Abbas?

44
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,965
I'm ready to wash me some dishes. Wow.

45
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,607
It looks really nice back here.
Did you do that?

46
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,609
What the fuck do you think about it?

47
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,584
You can just come to work
anytime you want to?

48
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:07,492
- Band practice ran a little late and...
- Band practice ran a little late?

49
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:13,463
I don't care
if the band practice ran a marathon.

50
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,835
You come here to work on time.

51
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,328
Yeah, I mean,

52
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,936
- you know I respect the grill, man.
- No.

53
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:31,147
You Americans just dance around
with happy, happy,

54
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,415
and your goddamn bacon cheeseburger.

55
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,818
Derek, you're fired!

56
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,655
Okay, wow.

57
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,531
Hi.

58
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,404
- Here you go. Well, thanks, Cheryl.
- Sure thing.

59
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,106
Say, listen, I have just one question for you.

60
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,204
What's that?

61
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,216
Are you ready
for the future of Port Gamble?

62
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,422
Cheryl, we have got some big plans
coming up for the next term.

63
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:15,317
Yeah, well, this is probably
as good a time as any to tell you

64
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,326
I'm running against you, Mayor Burton.

65
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,369
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

66
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,906
- How you doing today?
- Vote Burton.

67
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,277
Well... Miss Banks.

68
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,405
- See you on the campaign trail.
- Count on it.

69
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,381
Hey, Sam. Vote Burton.

70
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,597
God

71
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,030
is not a product.

72
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,935
He is not a television show.

73
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,307
He's not a can of processed meat.

74
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,511
God cannot be purchased cheaply
at the Wal-Mart.

75
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:21,525
We have to earn God through our deeds,

76
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:29,030
rising in his estimation, as we hope
to rise to paradise in the afterlife.

77
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,268
But the people in this country
are possessed

78
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,566
with a madness,

79
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,536
with betrayal,

80
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,412
with greed.

81
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,856
Aborted little babies.

82
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,029
Islamic terrorists.

83
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,763
Homosexuals getting married.

84
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:13,270
Friends, these sins
are but temporary delights in this world.

85
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,481
But they are a ticket straight to hell
in the next!

86
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,375
God

87
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,821
is watching.

88
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,952
And God will strike back soon.

89
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,893
Amen.

90
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,932
Amen!

91
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,944
That's it for today, brothers and sisters.
Remember, tonight's bingo night.

92
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,013
I made $50 last month.

93
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,423
This was not a good idea, Lance.

94
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,120
- Come on, Tom.
- Lance.

95
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,131
- I told you to ease up on all the queerisms.
- No, no, no, no, no, what? The queerisms?

96
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,828
I do what I want, when I want,
and I think you know that, Thomas.

97
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,532
Look, this is not Manhattan, all right?
Things are different out here.

98
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:52,566
Okay, fine, I understand your point.
But we've talked about this over and over.

99
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,937
We're gonna go have dinner
with your mama.

100
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,643
We'll come out over dessert, together,
and when it's done,

101
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,711
we'll head back on the boat,
go back east, and we will be free, Tom.

102
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,655
I mean, it's gonna be great. No more guilt.

103
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,221
Okay? No more dodging family holidays.

104
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,829
You know, no more deep, dark secrets
that we're keeping from everyone we know.

105
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,697
It's not a big deal.
I'm looking around, I like what I see.

106
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,600
- This is a cool town, come on.
- Cool?

107
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,036
- Cool? Cool?
- What?

108
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,301
- All right, I got your cool right here.
- What?

109
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,070
Gary Prince, my first love.

110
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,171
- He came out when he was 17.
- High school.

111
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,613
He was just beautiful.

112
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,515
He had this light in his eyes.

113
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,085
I always meant to let him know
how I felt about him,

114
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,885
but after he came out,
they shipped him off to a straight camp

115
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,428
somewhere in the Midwest.

116
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,260
They told him God would see him through.

117
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,160
What he was put through
at that Straight Acres, I'll never know.

118
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,739
But I swear he was like a zombie
when he came back.

119
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,801
Tom!

120
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,009
Thought that was Tom Hunt.

121
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,947
- Ms. Banks?
- Yeah. Look at you.

122
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:07,151
- What have you been up to?
- Well, you know, just doing Wall Street.

123
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,450
- How about you?
- Still teaching high school,

124
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,514
but not for much longer.

125
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,921
Right, sorry. Ms. Banks, this is my... Lance.

126
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:22,596
- Lance.
- I see. Very nice to meet you, Lance.

127
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,267
- Tom, this is so great. You're finally out.
- What?

128
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,070
You mean out of this town.
Yeah, I finally made it.

129
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,409
Well, Tom,

130
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,008
I'm very proud of you.
You can take that for what it's worth, okay?

131
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,451
- I should get back to my run.
- Thank you, Ms. Banks.

132
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,014
See you guys around, yeah?

133
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,069
- Reverend Haggis?
- Come in.

134
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,976
- Mayor Burton.
- Don't get up, Reverend Haggis.

135
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:19,986
Great sermon today, really great.
That second hour, faultless.

136
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,823
Thank you. I worked quite a bit
about that part about the abortion clinic.

137
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,956
Just the way that they're taking
the responsibility away from...

138
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,398
She's running against me.

139
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,271
- Banks is running against me.
- Banks?

140
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,164
She's a godless jezebel.

141
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,166
Well, Teddy, with all due respect,

142
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,577
- so is half the island.
- I know.

143
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,850
Truth be told, it's probably more than half.

144
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:49,318
Port Gamble has changed.
I mean, did you see that turnout today?

145
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:54,623
It's Sunday morning, for pity's sake.
It's God's prime time to shine.

146
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,995
Remember the 90s, Teddy?
Clinton was our go-to scapegoat.

147
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,193
We had the fishing industry.
Tourists by the hundreds.

148
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,602
We had two services on Sunday
and one on Wednesday.

149
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,633
I used to...
I used to say things of consequence.

150
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:17,475
I used to... I used to move people.
I don't know.

151
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,983
Hey, now, you still move them.

152
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:25,118
There may not be as many.
But believe me, they're all yours.

153
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,387
I just wish half of them
had as much devotion as you do.

154
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,088
Yeah, well,
I am your number one fan after all.

155
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,596
I know, Hal.

156
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,765
Things will pick up.

157
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,135
You wanna pray?

158
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:02,119
- You shouldn't pray in the front room, Dad.
- Don't start again, Frida.

159
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,073
- Dad, don't start.
- If you think you're going out

160
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,837
dressed like that,

161
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,069
you are insane.

162
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,738
Dad, I don't have time to change.
I'm going out.

163
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,351
With whom? With your pimp?

164
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,349
Dad, this is the way people dress
when they go on a date.

165
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,319
A date?

166
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,826
Is it Hamid?

167
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:41,490
Yeah, Dad, the one-brow wonder?
Yeah, that'd be a great date, wouldn't it?

168
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,158
You just don't like Hamid
because he's one of us.

169
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,644
It's truth, Frida.

170
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,478
- You're ashamed of who you are.
- You know what? You just hate Derek

171
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,678
- because he's not Iranian.
- Derek?

172
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,522
Derek Blaine?

173
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,858
The same guy that I fired today?

174
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,829
- You fired Derek today?
- You're surprised?

175
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,236
What happened to you, jelly-belly?

176
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,805
Quitting Princeton,
coming back to this bullshit place,

177
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,777
giving your time to nobodies?

178
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,871
Please, Dad,
you have no idea who I really am.

179
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,586
This, Frida, this is who you are.

180
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,490
You're part of the real culture,

181
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,084
real history.

182
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:48,194
You're Iranian. You're from the good family.

183
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:54,973
And one day,
you take our restaurant national.

184
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,437
But I don't want that. I've never wanted that.

185
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,570
I've seen what that place does to you.
All you do is work.

186
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,115
Who do you think this is all for?

187
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:09,915
I didn't make chicken-fried steak
for 20 years so you could be one of them.

188
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,583
What do you think your mother would say?

189
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,896
- I'm coming out, coming out, coming out.
- You are coming out.

190
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,033
- Can't believe it. Coming out.
- This is the day. I'm so excited for you.

191
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,635
It's gonna be so good.
It's gonna be a great dinner.

192
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,146
- This is crazy.
- Fuck.

193
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,380
Tom, sweetheart.

194
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,281
Honey.

195
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:48,252
I think now might be a good time
to stick to the plan

196
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,090
that we've discussed over and over again
because look where we are.

197
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,632
It's your house. Your mom's inside.

198
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,465
I don't understand
why you can't just figure it out.

199
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,526
- Because we're here.
- Okay, okay.

200
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,004
- And we came from the east coast.
- Okay, okay.

201
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,337
- What is the... No.
- She could happily live her whole life

202
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,206
- without ever knowing.
- Hey, but guess what? We're here right now.

203
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,145
This is who you are,
and she needs to know about it.

204
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,651
Wouldn't next year be a better year?
It's the Year of the Cock, I think.

205
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,610
Look at this.

206
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,946
Last year, you were "too busy."

207
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,685
And the year before that,
you dad had just died.

208
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,748
- And the year before that...
- Okay. Okay.

209
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,021
- I can't even keep track.
- All right, all right.

210
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,892
It's like, what is your deal?

211
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,125
You know what? Just come here.
Just walk with me. Come on.

212
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,897
This is... It's the time. This is the time.
Let's go. Come on.

213
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,562
- Wait.
- What?

214
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,472
What about your dad?
You never told me how your dad reacted.

215
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,705
It's not important. Let's go. Come on.
Come on.

216
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,780
- Frida!
- Derek, what the fuck?

217
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,486
- Hey, Freed. You ready?
- I don't know.

218
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,362
- Your dad?
- He means well.

219
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,695
It's just, he's just old-fashioned.

220
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,401
Yeah, old-fashioned my foot up his ass.

221
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,636
So that's it, huh? I'm ditched for the night
because of your dad?

222
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,077
Frida, when are you gonna realize

223
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:55,449
that you can't just let him control you
like that for your whole life?

224
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,512
It's like that song that I wrote,
Life Is a Rocky Road.

225
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,287
You know, where the guy
goes into the ice cream store

226
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,158
to buy himself some Rocky Road,

227
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,892
but then he realizes there's like
all these other flavors.

228
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,460
- You just got to find your flavor, girl.
- I have a flavor.

229
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,838
Just no one likes it.

230
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,681
- I like your flavor.
- You certainly do.

231
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,681
And I was just standing in line,
waiting for my latte,

232
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,982
when he just bent over
and he bit me on the arm.

233
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,990
Just like that.

234
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,789
And after I bought
three boxes of Girl Scout cookies

235
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,922
from that chubby little troll
of a granddaughter of his.

236
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:44,196
- God, that is awful.
- Mr. Chambers bit you. That is so weird.

237
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,564
Port Gamble is not what it used to be, dear.

238
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,835
I mean, it's just not safe
to go out on the streets anymore.

239
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,876
Well, really, Mom,
I'm just glad you're all right.

240
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,571
Well, thank you for your concern, dear.

241
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:04,952
So, Mrs. Hunt, I have been dying to know

242
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,584
what this handsome little devil was like
as a youngster.

243
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:15,691
Well, he was sort of an oddball.

244
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,930
- An oddball.
- Yeah.

245
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,335
Didn't have much luck with the ladies.

246
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,464
- Really?
- He really didn't.

247
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,739
And he was horrible at sports.

248
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:30,208
Guess you could say that, well,
he just didn't pan out.

249
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,877
- You know, I did pull six figures last year.
- Of course you did, dear.

250
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,214
Now don't get so defensive.

251
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,850
Now, his father on the other hand...

252
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,223
Now, there was a rock.
He was one of the last real men.

253
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,959
Yeah, until you got through with him.

254
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,731
Such a drama queen.

255
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,808
The medicines just don't seem
to be cutting it.

256
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,279
- Should we just call it a night?
- Mrs. Hunt,

257
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,223
are we still up for dessert, or...

258
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,354
Yes, yes, of course. Dessert, dessert.

259
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,989
I made your favorite.

260
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,191
- Ladyfingers?
- Ladyfingers.

261
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:26,069
Ladyfingers? You're such a fag, Tom.

262
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,751
Do you know where my lighter went?

263
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,347
What do you think, Freed?

264
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,492
- It's about me.
- See, I knew you'd get it.

265
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:05,266
- Does the song say I'm like a cheetah?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's my favorite line, too.

266
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,569
I mean, I know it's not like
Radiohead or anything, you know? But...

267
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,335
God!

268
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,214
- You dad?
- Yeah.

269
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,482
Dude, I heard you got fired today.

270
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,858
How stupid do you have to be to get fired
from washing dishes, D-Bone?

271
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,428
Well, you know, it's just your dad
is just such a total asshole.

272
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:38,197
Yeah, right, because it's not like
he's trying to run a business or anything.

273
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,931
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

274
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,006
- Are you standing up for your father?
- No.

275
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,267
Are you angry?

276
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,540
You are. You're pissed off.

277
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,649
God, you're just like your father
underneath all that, aren't you?

278
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,912
Gross!

279
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,978
Man, all you Iraqis are so pissed off
all the time.

280
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,254
You're, like, the third person today
to call me Iraqi. You know that?

281
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,592
Maybe it's because you have
such a perfect l-rack.

282
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:11,894
- Wow. That is so dumb of you to say.
- Or, you know, whatever, Middle Eastern.

283
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,668
Why do you people always take things
so Syria-sly?

284
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,133
I don't know, but I do know

285
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:23,371
that there is Norway
you are getting into these panties tonight.

286
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:31,484
I'm not... I'm not from Norway.
I'm American.

287
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,816
So am I, dumb shit.

288
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,325
Why does everybody think
I'm supposed to be this...

289
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:42,298
Hey, hey, whoa, Kuwait a minute, all right?
Now, you know I'm just joking, right?

290
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,770
You're right. I'm a dick.

291
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:56,975
You've been having a rough night,
and I'm being insensitive.

292
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:02,051
Look, man, I'm just Frida. That's it.

293
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:07,782
Why does everybody want me to be
whatever it is that they think I am, anyway?

294
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,961
I can't even have a normal conversation
with anybody.

295
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,928
I know, you're right.

296
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,368
I mean, you think that just 'cause I'm a real
American I don't run into this kind of shit?

297
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,330
I know what people think about me.

298
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,635
I know they think I'm just some total hack
who's never gonna write a good song.

299
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,940
So, I make jokes, you know. It's...

300
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,382
What do you call it?
It's a defense mechanism.

301
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,451
But I...

302
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,752
I love you, Frida. With a capital "L."

303
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,294
You're my lady.

304
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,695
That's my blood! Oh, God.

305
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,084
Oh, my God!

306
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,901
I can't do this.

307
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,105
Okay, Tom, you can do this.

308
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,372
- I can't.
- You can do this.

309
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,911
- I can't.
- You can, just say it.

310
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,705
"Mom, I'm gay."

311
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,949
- Mom?
- Yes, Thomas?

312
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,383
I'm...

313
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,819
- I'm thinking about...
- Stop, stop, okay?

314
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:28,025
That's fine. You have to start smaller.
So, just try,

315
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,860
"Mom, I have something to tell you."

316
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,870
Mom, I have something to tell you.

317
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,198
"I'm gay." Go.

318
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,638
I'm...

319
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:50,648
Life is filled with twists and turns.

320
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,450
I'm gay, Mom!

321
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,528
Mom?

322
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,607
Mom, I'm gay.

323
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,443
A homo, and a pretty good one, too.

324
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,520
- I suck dick, Mom.
- Sometimes.

325
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,490
Mom. Mom?

326
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,187
Mom?

327
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,604
Mom, I was born that way.

328
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,697
- It's nobody's fault.
- Mrs. Hunt, just calm down.

329
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,935
Look, if it's any consolation, he's the top.

330
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,874
- I receive.
- No, Mom, wait.

331
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:52,045
Mrs. Hunt, what are you doing?
Get off of him. What...

332
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:56,314
- Oh, my God. What the fuck is up her ass?
- I don't know. I'll get her meds.

333
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:00,517
Jesus, Mrs. Hunt. Her eyes!
Tom, get in here. Her eyes.

334
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:04,494
Mom, take these pills. Come on.

335
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,432
Mrs. Hunt, I'm not afraid to use this.

336
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,596
Mom, what are you doing?

337
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,572
Oh, God! Oh, God.

338
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,638
God!

339
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:48,496
That is how my dad reacted.

340
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,648
- Oh, God!
- Help!

341
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,629
Mommy ate Daddy.

342
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:19,766
I'm gonna take you home with me, okay?
My house is just across the street.

343
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,896
- What's your name, sweetie?
- Lisa.

344
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,641
Lisa, everything is going to be okay.
All right?

345
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:31,408
Nothing bad is going to happen to you.
I promise, okay?

346
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,476
Okay, let's go.

347
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,403
There's me on Santa's lap.

348
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,342
There's Dad in front of the old house.

349
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,878
Yeah? Dad? Remember? Carl?

350
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:24,790
Here.

351
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,839
No, no, okay.

352
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,705
No, she did not just eat her own eye.

353
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:40,080
Thomas, we are getting the fuck up
off this island.

354
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,547
Tom.

355
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,453
Get over here now.

356
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,963
News. News. Turn on the news.

357
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,538
- Nothing. Wait.
...no precedent in the history of our world.

358
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:16,978
Now tonight, in the normally quiet
island town of Port Gamble,

359
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,183
they are in the throes of a viral attack,

360
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,756
which purportedly turns its victims into,

361
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,958
well, what can be best described
as zombies.

362
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,903
Now these zombies have been described
as pale and slow moving,

363
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,433
with milky white eyes.

364
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:42,705
So, be on the lookout for these zombies.
They're all around you at this time...

365
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:16,909
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, let me in!

366
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,780
- Frida, hurry. Come over here. Hurry, hurry.
- Dad! Dad!

367
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,685
Hurry, hurry. Come over here. Come on.

368
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,813
Come on, get over here, hurry. Hurry, get in.

369
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,879
Frida.

370
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,954
God! No! No!

371
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,634
- Get away from the door, honey.
- Oh, God!

372
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,500
God damn you, zombie.

373
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,900
He bit me. Oh, my God.

374
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,969
Look at this, he bit me. Oh, God!

375
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,415
Zombie bastard!

376
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,753
God.

377
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,637
If you look at the evidence,
of which there's very little,

378
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,412
there is no conclusive proof that this was
a terrorist act...

379
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:29,442
Not conclusive? Son, you're about
a river short of a glass of water.

380
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,144
- The people...
- I, for one, believe

381
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,191
that our President has
spread our defense resources entirely...

382
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,749
Gentlemen, gentlemen, we'll not get
any words in here edgewise.

383
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,421
- One at a time, please. Let's not...
- That's ignorant.

384
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:45,464
People of Port Gamble, get your guns
and your bombs and start exercising

385
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,973
your God-given right to exercise
your God-given right.

386
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:55,803
Okay, I repeat, we need to get the fuck up
out of here.

387
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,744
I know, but what about Mom?

388
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,743
You can't encourage the citizens to go
around and blow up everything in sight...

389
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,345
- I hear a lot of noise in the background.
- Irresponsible...

390
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,479
Mom?

391
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,222
You are an absolute idiot.
Why did I agree to do this show?

392
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,753
We're not getting anywhere, here. I'm done.
Just shut that thing off.

393
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,357
Mom.

394
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,139
Shoot... Shoot her.

395
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:06,142
- Come on!
- I can't. Just run.

396
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,195
- Brian, did you board up the house?
- Everything but the back door.

397
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:25,964
- We'll leave the back door open for an exit.
- But what about Mom?

398
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:31,072
- I'll take care of you, Judy. Come on.
- Oddly enough, it doesn't hurt that bad.

399
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,644
Sort of numb and tingly.

400
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:58,360
Sweet Jesus, here we go. Crying Brian.
That's you in a pickle.

401
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,733
Look, we got plenty of water.

402
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,335
And we went to the superstore,
so we got Ramen and beans and shit.

403
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,005
I didn't have half of that growing up
and I turned out better for it.

404
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,787
Brian, you gotta learn self-reliance.

405
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,148
You think the government gives a shit
about you or me or your mother?

406
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,527
Look, I don't know about the next life,
but in this one,

407
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,960
a man has gotta learn
to take care of himself.

408
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,062
But... But what about Mom?

409
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:37,766
The United States is under attack.

410
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,339
Terrorists have managed to unleash
a virus.

411
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,276
The likes of which has
no precedent in the history of our world.

412
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:47,948
- Now tonight...
- Dad.

413
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:52,148
Brian, so help me God, I will plunder you
if you open your mouth again.

414
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,853
- But Mom!
- Your mom is made of tougher stuff

415
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,449
than you think.

416
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,390
It's just a bite from a zombie.

417
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,159
...as zombies.

418
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,655
What?

419
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,496
The White House has issued a statement
attributing the attack

420
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:10,040
to the infamous terrorist leader,
Mohammed Mustafa.

421
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:15,407
Citing the following videotape message,
which surfaced on Christmas Eve

422
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,338
of last year.

423
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:27,949
For years you Americans have terrorized
our people, insulted Allah and our culture.

424
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,121
You tried to destroy us...

425
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,287
Again with the Muslims.

426
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:37,664
Dad, she was bitten. Haven't you ever
seen a zombie movie before?

427
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,871
Brian, you know I'm a vampire man.

428
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,533
Now get your head in the game,
for Christ's sake.

429
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:00,518
Mr. Miller, I left my purse
in my dead boyfriend's car.

430
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,388
Could I just use your phone
to call my dad?

431
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,429
You tried to destroy us and yet we live.

432
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,895
You tried to devour us and yet
you will devour yourselves.

433
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,937
Dad she's going to turn into a zombie.

434
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,076
Dad, we have to tie her up
or she could attack us.

435
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,545
Tying her up ain't gonna do it.

436
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,515
This is the infamous terrorist leader,
Mohammed Mustafa,

437
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,382
- who swore...
- We gotta throw her out.

438
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,450
- She's threatening our family.
...who reportedly brought the zombies in...

439
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,186
What are you talking about?
Mom is our family.

440
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,790
I'm not talking about Mom.

441
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,721
...instructions on the things
that you'll need to do...

442
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,825
- Frida.
- Steps one, two and three

443
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,837
we will take you through. Stay with us.

444
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:51,170
- What?
- Jesus, Brian, look at the necklace.

445
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,402
Now look at the TV.

446
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,502
...places for you to call,
places for you to go.

447
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,907
- No, no, no, no.
- She's one of them.

448
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:00,141
- Mr. Miller, this is a pendant my mom...
- Brian, we gotta throw her out.

449
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,611
- Throw me out? Are you crazy?
- Some of us gotta give up certain rights

450
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,622
- to stay safe.
- No, Dad, no.

451
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,286
- Throwing her out there is murder.
- Mr. Miller, I was born and raised here.

452
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,762
Now, think about it? Princeton?

453
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,958
Who knows where she's really been.

454
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,497
And Ali, how is he able to make such
a success of the cafe when I couldn't,

455
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,471
and I busted my ass?

456
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,204
And speaking of the cafe, who are the only
people in town who refuse to eat there?

457
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:32,272
You, me, Mom,
and we're not infected. Coincidence?

458
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,851
- Mom is infected.
- I think not.

459
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,246
Oh, God! Oh, God!

460
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,801
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hey.

461
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,205
Hold on. Hold on.

462
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,293
Okay. I'm ready.

463
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,371
Dad, I'm telling you,
we should be tying up Mom.

464
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,211
Brian, okay? Okay, Brian?

465
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,479
Frida, I'm gonna ask you some questions.

466
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,952
- Jesus Christ, Dad, come on.
- Brian, so help me God.

467
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:53,288
God. No. Mr. Miller, this is fucking crazy.
You've known me for years.

468
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,093
This pendant belonged to my mom.

469
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,502
Frida, I want you to relax.

470
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,002
We will bring you no harm.

471
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,242
- Okay.
- What's the color of the US passport?

472
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,683
- What the fuck does that have to do...
- Frida, I will throw you to the zombies!

473
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,585
- Okay, blue. Blue.
- Okay.

474
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:23,352
Okay. Okay. See? See? Okay.

475
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,691
I would have said dark blue!

476
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,097
- Dad.
- No. Okay, dark blue.

477
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,154
- Too late.
- Dark blue.

478
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:36,597
Listen up, why does the US flag have...
Thirteen stripes?

479
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,708
Because they represent
the original 13 colonies.

480
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:42,768
Correct.

481
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,939
But most American high school graduates
wouldn't know that.

482
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,786
- Dad!
- So...

483
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,759
What do you know about making bombs?

484
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:05,159
Yeah, nice shot.
There's one by the car. Gun!

485
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:06,527
Yeah!

486
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,106
Yeah, how do you like that?

487
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,103
Come on.

488
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:20,077
Oh, God. Hey, it's a rescue chopper.
We're saved.

489
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,983
It's not a rescue chopper.
That's the Channel 8 News.

490
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,648
Come on, can't you see us? Stop!
Come on!

491
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,295
Hey, come on, give us a ride, man!

492
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:35,921
Fuck!

493
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,364
God, she was, like, eight.

494
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,138
Come on, yeah!

495
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,466
We've got to hole up somewhere.

496
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:50,138
- We can't keep this up.
- It's dying, it's dying.

497
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,578
- Let's go.
- Okay, this way.

498
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:59,014
Mr. Lucio, you gotta let us in.
Come on, there are zombies.

499
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:04,618
- No, no, no, don't shoot. Please, let us in.
- Don't, don't, just open the door.

500
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,559
- Please let us in.
- What are you doing?

501
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,097
- Open the door!
- What are you doing?

502
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,894
- Come on.
- Mr. Lucio.

503
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,329
What?

504
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,464
You homophobe.

505
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:27,074
Oh, say, can you see

506
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:30,814
by the dawn's early light

507
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:35,385
What so proudly we hailed

508
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:39,225
at the twilight's last gleaming...

509
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:43,255
No, no, no! It's a C for shit's sake.

510
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,534
Okay, Frida,
assuming I'm calling you by your real name.

511
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,437
I want you to eat this ham.

512
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,613
- Where did you get...
- You hesitated.

513
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,545
No, no, no. Okay, I'll eat it. I'll eat it. Just...

514
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,849
Shit. Did that count?

515
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,355
Why the fuck would terrorists choose
to attack Port Gamble?

516
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,321
Exactly, why would terrorists
attack Port Gamble?

517
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,989
- Right. Why?
- That's what I'm asking you.

518
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:18,228
- No, that's what I'm answering.
- No, no, I'm the one who should...

519
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,731
You should say... Get out of my head!

520
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,539
You're cunning as a cheetah, girl.

521
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,943
Yeah. Yeah, but I'm gonna get what I need.

522
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,481
- Watch her, I'll be right back.
- Dad. Holy shit,

523
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,246
if you're gonna torture her, I am not just
gonna sit there and let it happen.

524
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,652
Just showing her the torture device
ought to do it.

525
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:41,452
Do what?
She'll just admit to whatever you tell her to.

526
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,186
- Exactly.
- But if she has nothing to admit to...

527
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,026
You are not gonna deter me
from my God-given right as an American.

528
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,588
- Dad, you're from Canada.
- Not anymore.

529
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,931
Just try to think of it
from Frida's perspective.

530
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,836
Safety first, Brian. Work shed.

531
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,219
What did you do to my Frida?

532
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:36,168
Frida! Where are you, sweetheart?

533
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,583
Derek, Derek Blaine? Come.

534
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,980
Come to Daddy, you fucking piece of shit!

535
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,479
Casey!

536
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:53,223
No, Casey. No, Casey. No!

537
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,388
No!

538
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,869
Where is Frida, God damn it?

539
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,127
Can you speak English?

540
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:03,695
Casey.

541
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,502
You son of a bitch.

542
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,741
This is for you, Frida!

543
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,591
Get away from me, you zombies.

544
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:27,357
- Miss Banks, over here.
- Come on, over here.

545
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,796
- Come on.
- Come on.

546
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,526
Come on.

547
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:35,435
B12, B12, Vitamin B12,
ladies and gentlemen.

548
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,132
Anybody, Vitamin B12.

549
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,808
How many sheets, dearie.

550
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,215
You got to be kidding, lady.
There's zombies and shit outside.

551
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,618
- Guys, help me! Help me.
- Come on.

552
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,816
Did you not just hear me, man? Zombies.

553
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,861
You can't go out there, sir.
You don't understand.

554
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,829
I think I do. Good evening, gentlemen.

555
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,291
No, no, no.

556
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,265
Don't go out there. No, no.

557
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:18,104
Mrs. Rutherford,
and how does the evening find you?

558
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:22,481
I'll tell you, old girl, I hope I'm not being
too forward. If you...

559
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,178
That's my blood.

560
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,488
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Mr. Weatherbee needs our help.

561
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,495
You cannot go out there, Reverend.
You cannot.

562
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,428
Reverend, turn on the outside lights.

563
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,548
All right, everyone stay calm.

564
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,991
- Stay away from the windows.
- And dim the lights.

565
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,754
Bingo night has been canceled.

566
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:09,094
- We're gonna need some hammers.
- And boards.

567
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,195
Thank you, Mayor,
I think I know what this is.

568
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:17,098
- I've got to consult some tomes.
- Tomes?

569
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,569
Wikipedia. I'll be right back.

570
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:24,808
There's cookies on the back table
and lemon drink.

571
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,775
Oh, God. Brian, oh, God, come on.

572
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,449
You've known me since we were kids.

573
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,818
It doesn't make any sense.

574
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,723
Frida, just play along with him
or something.

575
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:40,092
- Play along? I'm supposed to sit here...
- He's just trying to scare you.

576
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,222
- He won't actually do anything.
- No fucking way, Brian.

577
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,632
- He's all talk.
- Just let me go. Please, just let me go.

578
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,933
- Just tell him what he wants to hear.
- What? That I am a terrorist?

579
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:52,839
That I got a fucking
ticking zombie bomb in my bra?

580
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,573
There is no right answer for him.

581
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:00,915
You're right.

582
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,747
So, why don't you just let me go?

583
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,247
Come on, set me free.

584
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,956
I want to be free, Brian.

585
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:18,296
I mean, we're neighbors, right?

586
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:25,135
And I've always felt, like, something

587
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,712
around you,
and I know that we haven't played fort

588
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:36,980
or hung out or anything like that,
but I've been watching you.

589
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,512
Seriously.

590
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,954
I even saw that play that you invited me to.

591
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,256
So...

592
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,527
So, do you think that...

593
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,902
I don't know, that you think
that maybe you and I...

594
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,943
Yeah. Yeah,
but not if your dad fucking tortures me.

595
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,637
Right? So, here, get me out.

596
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:07,114
Just let me go. Come on, come on.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

597
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,277
Come on, come on.

598
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,774
Don't you think it would be a good idea
if those demons would just

599
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,216
feed upon one another?

600
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,014
I know, I know, honey, but just hang tight.

601
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,351
I'll come for you in the morning, promise.

602
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,686
Well, just apply pressure to it.

603
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,354
Yeah, I know, Mom. Yes, Mom, I know.

604
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,791
Now look, they're totally blowing it
way out of proportion. It's not...

605
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:01,031
Yeah, just trust me, we're cool. It's fine.

606
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,808
"Did Tom come out?"
That is a fantastic question.

607
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,901
Let me think about that for a sec.

608
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:15,684
Kind of. He sort of did.
We kind of got interrupted by his mom.

609
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:19,087
Oh, God, you should have been there.
For this one part, he was, like,

610
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:24,316
"I suck dick, Mom." He was so... It was cute.
He was good. He was funny.

611
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,895
Okay. All right, love. Later, babe.

612
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,629
Hey, just while we're here,
will you try to act straight?

613
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,210
- Like what? Like how? What?
- Straight.

614
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,278
You know, straight.

615
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,075
'Cause that's straight, right?

616
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,709
- Well, straighter than you.
- Damn straight, you're straighter than me,

617
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,309
- but I still love you.
- No, no, no.

618
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,115
Brothers and sisters,

619
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:03,996
the Mayor and I would like to
take this opportunity

620
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:07,036
to welcome the newcomers to our church

621
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,870
and to Armageddon.

622
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,474
This is it. This is Judgment Day.

623
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,079
This is the day that I've been
telling you about all my life.

624
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:26,645
It's a time when Christ will separate
the righteous

625
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:30,056
from the sinners,

626
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:36,729
and the pure will inherit the earth.

627
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,325
Make no mistake, folks.

628
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:46,273
It is not a coincidence that Judgment Day
fell upon us when we were all here,

629
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,304
safe in His house of worship.

630
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:56,385
Because out there are the sinners.

631
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:04,356
The Unitarians, the gays, the pro-choicers

632
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:12,095
the doomed, the demons
that have resided in their souls

633
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:20,433
have emerged to possess their minds
and their bodies.

634
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,276
This is the night where
Christ will come down...

635
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,575
What about my brother?

636
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,283
Casey was a good man,

637
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,455
one of your most devoted followers,
and now he's

638
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,195
one of them.

639
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,327
And you're saying it's because he's evil?

640
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,366
It's probably an environmental illness
from all the toxins in Port Gamble.

641
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,274
I mean, think about it,
sweats, gray skin, runny noses?

642
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,181
Miss Banks. Cheryl.

643
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,321
Casey was a good man.

644
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,021
But his closet is not without
a skeleton or two.

645
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,426
- Isn't that true?
- You son of a bitch.

646
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,930
Couldn't it be possible that Casey's virus

647
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:19,557
was not the result
of some scientific mumbo jumbo?

648
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,934
But in fact, took hold
because Casey's life was filled

649
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:24,974
- with sin and misdeeds.
- Look, we do not have time for this.

650
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:28,042
We have to zombie-proof this entire area.

651
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,974
Larry, Tom, Lance,
board up all the windows.

652
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,316
These things could break
right through the glass.

653
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:42,983
Mrs. Happenstance, Clive,
take an inventory of our food supply.

654
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:46,085
How long can we stay alive in here? Go.

655
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:49,393
Miss Banks is absolutely right.

656
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,026
But she's forgotten one important step.

657
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,529
We have to zombie-proof our souls.

658
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:02,643
We have to free ourselves
of every last trace of sin.

659
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,906
I will absolve each of you

660
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,618
to make sure you do not become

661
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,615
one of them.

662
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:18,152
No, no, no. Have no fear, friends,

663
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:23,726
for we have history's greatest
zombie on our side,

664
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:27,066
Jesus Christ.

665
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:41,549
Mr. Miller, Joe, Joe, I'm not a terrorist.

666
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,745
I am not a terrorist.

667
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,683
I'm your neighbor. Joe?

668
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,155
Joe! Joe!

669
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:03,329
- Silence!
- No! No!

670
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,313
- Jesus Christ!
- Brian. For God's sake!

671
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:33,001
All right, Frida,
you got one more shot at this.

672
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,432
Now what the fuck is going on?

673
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,475
You're out of your fucking mind.
That's what's going on.

674
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,874
Come on, Frida. Let's hear it, baby.
Come on!

675
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,733
- God!
- Shit! My bad.

676
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,149
Okay.

677
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,452
Okay.

678
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,147
Oh, God! Oh, God!

679
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:24,841
Okay, everyone. If you could just
grab a seat, I'll give you all a status report.

680
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:43,360
As you know, we are under siege
by a gang of flesh-hungry cannibals.

681
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,260
- Hey, are you all right?
- Sure.

682
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,765
- But I think we're gonna miss the last ferry.
- Yeah.

683
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:53,700
- Speaking of fairy, how's my straight act?
- Yeah, good.

684
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,873
You've gone from a Richard Simmons
to a Tom Cruise.

685
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,839
We've got at least a makeshift weapon
for everyone,

686
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,909
including a couple of guns
that Larry saw fit to bring to church.

687
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:07,649
Hey, I come prepared, honey.
I'll donate what I have,

688
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:09,681
except for little Billy, here.

689
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:13,725
I absolutely condemn the use of guns,
so please, be careful.

690
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,761
You betcha.

691
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:20,835
There's only one other matter we need to
attend to, and that is Mayor Burton.

692
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,873
I think it's become pretty obvious
that Mayor Burton has the zombie sickness,

693
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:28,604
- and I, for one, think that we should...
- Wait a minute, Cheryl.

694
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:34,479
I can personally attest to the Mayor's purity
and strength of his everlasting soul.

695
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:38,247
Reverend Haggis,
I'm not attacking Mayor Burton's character

696
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:41,654
or validity of your theory.
I'm just saying, look at him.

697
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,054
He's got yellow eyes.

698
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:46,795
- I've got glaucoma.
- Gray skin.

699
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:51,664
- I've got eczema.
- I'm not suggesting anything drastic here.

700
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:56,034
I'm just saying that we should employ
a little quarantine until we know

701
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:59,268
- whether or not you...
- Just a minute. I built this town.

702
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:04,410
I've been mayor since this island
was a couple of cabins and a campground.

703
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:08,782
I'm scandal-free.

704
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,783
My closets have no skeletons.

705
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:15,756
- Again, I am not attacking your character...
- What have you accomplished?

706
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:21,995
A failed marriage. Your students' test
scores drop lower and lower every year.

707
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:26,697
- You could be a lesbian for all we know.
- Mayor Burton, listen to yourself!

708
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:29,932
You're tarnishing the reputation
of one of our best teachers

709
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:32,371
just so you can stay out of quarantine.

710
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,942
I mean, you're clearly a grunt away
from becoming one of them,

711
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,545
and you wanna sit there
and put the rest of us in danger.

712
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:39,908
Yeah, motherfucker!

713
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:43,075
How your retarded ass got to be mayor
is beyond me!

714
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:44,842
Bitch!

715
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,689
My God! Did you hear that echo?
That was great. I just called him bitch.

716
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:51,989
That was fucking awesome.
Shit, here he comes. Fuck him up, Tom.

717
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,860
Son, can I just ask you
to unzip your jacket?

718
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,029
Let's stick to the issue.

719
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:06,199
- Hal, no. No.
- Hiding something there, Tom?

720
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,278
I'm with him, huh?

721
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,178
I'm with him.

722
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,381
Folks, this here is a war.

723
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:28,186
On one side, you've got your pure.

724
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:31,427
On the other,
sinners soon to become zombies.

725
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,862
And we all gotta take sides.

726
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,873
What side are you on, Tom?

727
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,170
- Throw the faggots out!
- Throw the faggots out!

728
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:45,180
- Quiet.
- They don't belong here.

729
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,739
- Quiet down.
- Get the faggots out of here.

730
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,381
Now, shame on you.

731
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,124
- How dare you?
- Haggis.

732
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,024
No, Hal.

733
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,587
This is absolutely wrong.

734
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,127
They are children of God.

735
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,432
You're as bad as those monsters outside.

736
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,204
Shame. Shame on every one of you.

737
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:19,306
We just have to convert them.

738
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:50,204
Dad? Dad?

739
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:01,316
Dad?

740
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:43,990
Dad?

741
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:55,208
Dad?

742
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:14,688
Dad.

743
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,891
Jelly belly?

744
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,570
Frida!

745
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,712
I'm so sorry, Dad. I'm sorry I left.

746
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,308
- That's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

747
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,046
That's okay.

748
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:43,113
Dad, everyone's dead. Derek's dead.

749
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,692
You're right.

750
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:06,247
I ran every street to find you.

751
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,418
Now I can rest.

752
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,352
It's all over.

753
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,995
- Everything I worked for.
- No.

754
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,999
- It's all gone.
- It's okay.

755
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:29,362
Everything will still be standing
when this is over.

756
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:38,008
The pizza man tries to get even,

757
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,077
but I took care of him.

758
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,210
The boy is fired.

759
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,555
You know it.

760
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:47,008
No. No, boys, don't worry.

761
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,982
We don't even use
the electric coils anymore.

762
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:55,045
- Electric coils?
- No, it is totally humane. Really.

763
01:09:55,858 --> 01:10:01,626
We have some footage of
homosexual images, which you'll watch,

764
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,896
and we'll inject you with an IV drip...

765
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:06,867
- I'm right behind you.
...which will make you nauseous.

766
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:08,968
No.

767
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,906
Boys, I'm sorry, I'm not very good
at explaining the conversion machine,

768
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,773
but it works. I swear it works.

769
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:23,912
- And it's absolutely painless.
- Look, we'll just go, okay?

770
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:26,419
- We'll just...
- No. No. No, I can't let you go outside.

771
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,251
It's too dangerous out there.

772
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:34,194
Look, this is the same machine we used
on Gary Prince. You remember him, Tom?

773
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,231
He was a perfect angel
when we were done with the treatment.

774
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,527
Oh, God!

775
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:42,560
That's the spirit! Now if you'll just
follow me to the conversion room.

776
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,129
Room? You have a conversion room?

777
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:50,839
Well, it's my office, actually. But when
we're done, you'll be like one of us.

778
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,240
- You'll be free.
- Stop struggling, fruit lips.

779
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:57,046
- It's for your own good.
- Ted, I am not gonna let you

780
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,280
torture those boys.

781
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:12,531
Open this door! Let me in!

782
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,031
Damn you! Let me in!

783
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,240
Hal?

784
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,368
- Hal?
- Open this door!

785
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:27,438
- Hal.
- You bastards! Let me in!

786
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,982
Hal, you wanna help me with Cheryl?

787
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,164
Reverend Haggis, please, have mercy.

788
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:27,097
Just let us out of here.
We'll be fine on our own, I swear.

789
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:30,143
You're all going straight to hell!

790
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:33,373
- You cocksucking motherfuckers!
- You just need to calm down.

791
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,110
When we are done here,

792
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,586
you are gonna know a life that is free

793
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:42,886
of the hardships of persecution and sin.

794
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:47,153
I feed off of persecution and sin!

795
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,993
There is so much more.

796
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:55,260
I am so excited. I haven't used this thing
since the glory days.

797
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,932
This is in case you vomit.

798
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:02,632
Hit him.

799
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:11,619
I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.

800
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,572
This?

801
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,213
This is homoerotic?

802
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,648
You see, it's working already.

803
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,254
Open the door!

804
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:52,122
- Hal?
- Let me in!

805
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,394
You look under the weather, Hal.

806
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,539
Hal, hear that?

807
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:14,347
You don't look so good, Hal.
Would you like another cough drop?

808
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,494
All right, nobody move. Hands up!

809
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:07,060
I'll shoot him.

810
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:11,196
I swear on my mother's good name,
I'll paint these walls with his brains.

811
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,967
All right.
Number one, Clive, you untie Lance.

812
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:19,638
Then Haggis, number two,
open that door and let Miss Banks in.

813
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:25,615
All right. Everybody over in that corner.
Move. Move.

814
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,684
They're here to save us. It's over.
It's all over.

815
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,125
Come on, guys. Move.

816
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,698
No, Hal.

817
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,368
Hal.

818
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,770
- Forget it, Reverend. It's too late.
- No.

819
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,738
No, I can convert him, too.

820
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,907
The power of Christ can do anything.

821
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,835
I think we have some unfinished business
to attend to.

822
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,330
Bitch!

823
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,463
This time,
you're not gonna get away from me.

824
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,078
Frida!

825
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,182
Frida.

826
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,724
Frida, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Frida.

827
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,232
Frida. Frida!

828
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:04,007
Frida, I'm sorry. Please. Please, Frida.

829
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:09,040
- I forgive you.
- Frida, I'm sorry. I lost it, okay?

830
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:12,515
There's nothing wrong with you.

831
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:14,646
Frida!

832
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,256
No, get back, you fuckers.

833
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,892
Get back you dirty fuckers.

834
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,529
Hal, think about all we've done together.
We've worked together hard

835
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,299
to make this a better place.

836
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,671
Remember, Hal. Remember.

837
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,047
You wanna pray?

838
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,926
The power of Christ compels you to...

839
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:15,107
God, forgive me. I tried.

840
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:38,372
Oh, God. Get it off!

841
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,447
Here.

842
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:59,085
- No. No. No.
- Yeah, I know. Just take it.

843
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:18,871
No.

844
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:37,096
Miss Banks. Miss Banks!

845
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,234
Miss Banks!

846
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,410
Don't shoot. I'm gay.

847
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,588
And I'm Frida. Let's go.

848
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:49,159
Are you infected?

849
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,363
- No.
- No.

850
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:16,026
I'm standing here in the main square
of the now infamous Port Gamble,

851
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,700
where today at noon, a six-month
quarantine has come to its official end.

852
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:22,830
Now, although spirits are high
and we've learned much,

853
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:24,701
many questions remain.

854
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:28,703
Where is Mustafa and how was he able
to unleash the virus?

855
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:33,938
Is the virus curable, and most importantly,
could it ever re-emerge?

856
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,873
Even as the Port Gambleites celebrate,

857
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,352
many of their loved ones are being
carefully studied.

858
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,247
And it is hard to step out
from under the shadow

859
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:46,286
of the infected and the dead.

860
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:51,257
This is Dan Campbell, live at Port Gamble.

861
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,291
How was that?

862
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,531
I felt a couple of locks of hair move.
Was that just me or...

863
01:22:57,605 --> 01:22:59,232
And most importantly...

864
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:20,851
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

865
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,838
- Hey, homos.
- Hey, jihad. Where you been?

866
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:34,399
Where do you think? Seventh circle of hell.

867
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,411
But I'm happy for you guys. New York, huh?

868
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:38,907
And unless our apartment's been robbed,

869
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,971
we'll always have a couch
for you to sleep on, okay?

870
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,513
A couch, Tom?

871
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,149
I'm sorry, Frida. You can sleep on the bed.

872
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,484
You saved our fucking lives. Tom, rude.

873
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:50,122
Frida, honey, listen.

874
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:54,388
The customers.
They don't know what the hell this says.

875
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:57,160
Velma, that's ghormeh sabzi.

876
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,366
Well I know that, Frida, honey.

877
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:06,702
It's just really not the time to put
Iraqi food on...

878
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,675
All right. You know what, Velma? Just...

879
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:15,714
If the customers don't wanna eat it,
then they won't order it. Okay, Velma?

880
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:22,418
Listen, Frida.

881
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:25,182
You've been cooped up in this place
for quite a while.

882
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,058
Why don't you get out?
Get some sun, get some air.

883
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:30,620
Guys.

884
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:35,496
No, I'm... I'm busy. Thanks.

885
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:38,394
It's your call.

886
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:43,838
Just, Frida, don't, you know,
get stuck in here or whatever.

887
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:46,237
- I won't.
- Yeah, and come visit.

888
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,708
All right? East coast.
I wanna see you out there.

889
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,011
I will. I will.

890
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:52,944
- Thanks, guys.
- Bye.

891
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,955
- Bye.
- Call us.

892
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:05,197
Good afternoon, my fellow Port Gambleites.

893
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:09,898
Welcome to our first annual
Green Light Day.

894
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:14,105
Because we can't protect an island

895
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:17,344
or a country, for that matter,
on peace alone.

896
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:19,539
We need a stronger police force.

897
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:23,310
We need a homeland security presence
here, on the island.

898
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:27,219
Defense begins with you and me.

899
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:32,453
We must remain armed and vigilant
against any future threat.

900
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:37,387
We must be ready to report any and all
suspicious behavior.

901
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:43,161
Yes, we've suffered.
Yes, we've lost good people.

902
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:50,509
But let us honor their memory
by rising above the ashes of what was.

903
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:56,107
To forge a stronger Port Gamble,
united and alive.

904
01:25:57,352 --> 01:26:03,018
And so, I invite you to take this first step
with me, as one people,

905
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:07,587
into the safe, clear waters
of our collective future.
