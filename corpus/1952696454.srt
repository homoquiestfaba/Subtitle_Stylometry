1
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:05,170
lt's time to ride the slide
and taste the wind.

2
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:07,138
Humphrey, you are totally genius.

3
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:09,304
Come on. Let's do it.

4
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:11,400
Air wolf!

5
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:16,746
Guys. Guys.

6
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:21,984
We're not moving!

7
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:25,186
This caribou is mine.

8
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,952
Kate, l'm not a caribou. l'm your sister!

9
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,425
Gotcha.

10
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,627
Omegas don't play like this.

11
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:39,566
You can't escape the greatest Alpha ever.

12
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,429
Well, l just did.

13
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:47,573
We're going to die!

14
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,672
Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

15
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,948
What was l thinking?

16
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:01,659
That was great!

17
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:03,422
We are flying today, guys.

18
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:09,593
Humphrey?

19
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,761
Kate?

20
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:30,716
What are you doing up here?

21
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,621
l'm practice-hunting for our lunch.

22
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:35,087
Good, 'cause l'm about to lose mine.

23
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:36,622
You are?

24
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:38,391
l'll try to swallow it.

25
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:42,295
Kate!

26
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:43,858
lt's time to go.

27
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:45,836
l'm coming, Dad.

28
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:47,133
Where you going?

29
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:49,606
Alpha school. lt goes till spring.

30
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:51,307
Spring?

31
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:53,402
But that's a whole winter away.

32
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:58,115
l know you're Kate's friend, Humphrey.

33
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:01,620
But by next spring,
she will be a trained Alpha,

34
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:04,118
the future leader of the pack.

35
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,422
No doubt you'll be a clever Omega.

36
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:13,931
Learn to keep the peace.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,524
And Humphrey,

38
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,833
remind us all to have fun.

39
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:20,027
But.. . But.. .

40
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:22,131
Alphas and Omegas can't.. .

41
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:26,067
How do you say it?

42
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:35,451
That's our custom. The law of the pack.

43
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:39,518
Wolf pile!

44
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,595
Silly Omegas.

45
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:46,019
Hey.

46
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,726
Take a left! Thirty degrees!

47
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,389
Salty, give her some sail draft!

48
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,363
l think l taste the wind.

49
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:58,300
No, just a bug.

50
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:03,037
Hey, Mooch, get ready! Lower the boom!

51
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:08,046
-All right!
-Hang 10, boys!

52
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:12,482
Guys, we really need to work on the brakes!

53
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,143
-Brakes?
-Brakes?

54
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:20,617
Wolf pile!

55
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:25,390
Get your butt out of my face.

56
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,056
What did we hit?

57
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,897
Spring.

58
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:39,937
Look who's back from Alpha school.

59
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,040
Forget about it, Humphrey.
Kate's an Alpha now.

60
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:45,879
And you're an Omega.

61
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:48,920
We're friends, okay?

62
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:53,618
Exactly. Just friends. End of story.

63
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:56,594
You better set your sights over there.

64
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:01,793
Reba and Janice, the vegetarians.

65
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,128
Okay.

66
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:12,743
Looks like we're
eating caribou tonight, boys.

67
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:14,074
Hey. Hey.

68
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:18,078
Eastern Pack wolves.

69
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:26,216
Can-do, Hutch, we've got company.

70
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,793
Great. There goes dinner.

71
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,532
And there goes Kate.

72
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,585
-Holy.. .
-Caribou!

73
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,152
Scatter to the sides!

74
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:04,693
Look at those moves.

75
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,430
Settle the score, leader.

76
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,719
Are you all right?

77
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:42,063
-Yeah, l'm fine.
-Hey, what's your problem,

78
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:45,262
you stupid Eastern dog?
That was our hunt.

79
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:46,998
You can't just snake it out from under us.

80
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,539
Can-do, back off.

81
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:50,937
You better listen to the girl.

82
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:56,044
Hey, break it up.
Can-do, Hutch, break it up!

83
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:59,181
All right, Omegas, duty calls.

84
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:01,481
Stop it. Can-do, Hutch, stop!

85
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,545
-Hey!
-Candy!

86
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:09,958
-Kate.
-Humphrey?

87
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,963
l'm still going to tear this snaggletooth
fool apart.

88
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:16,200
Guys, lower the boom!

89
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,903
Humphrey, we don't have time for fun.

90
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:33,476
Guys, guys, come on.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.

91
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:36,487
You wolves are making us look bad.
Come on, the caribou are laughing at us.

92
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,982
Now, that's a moon
l don't want to howl to.

93
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:47,621
Western hunt group, get back to the den.

94
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:52,602
The two of you, go home.

95
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:54,597
Now!

96
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,834
Omegas, good job.

97
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,780
Great. My first hunt, and l blew it.

98
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:09,514
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.

99
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:12,853
Don't beat yourself up. That's crazy.
You were amazing.

100
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:15,826
l mean, if anyone's hungry, they can eat.. .

101
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:19,361
They can always eat.. .

102
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:21,421
What?

103
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:25,626
Here.

104
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:28,063
They can eat berries.

105
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:34,045
Berries are really nutritious.

106
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,071
Yeah. Tell that to a hungry pack.

107
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:19,616
The Eastern Wolves ruined Kate's hunt.

108
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,923
Luckily, the Omegas were there
to break up the fight.

109
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:33,304
-Lilly.
-What?

110
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:37,567
Very funny. Stop playing with your tail.

111
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:40,441
Kate, you're slouching. Thank you, honey.

112
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:42,571
Do you see how strong
and beautiful you are?

113
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:46,983
My.

114
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:50,283
Any food is a blessing, dear.

115
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:55,023
Winston? Come join us for dinner? Now!

116
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:00,527
Thank you, honey.

117
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,126
Scraps and bones is no kind of dinner.

118
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:06,127
Not for my pack.

119
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:11,170
l'm sorry, Dad.
lt's just those Eastern Wolves.

120
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:13,534
lt's not your fault, Kate.

121
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:18,242
When they crossed into our territory,
they broke pack law.

122
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:19,409
Winston.

123
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:28,216
Can-do was jumped
by a group of Eastern Wolves.

124
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:29,920
lt ain't nothing.

125
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,898
Quickly, bring him into the den.

126
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:39,399
Winston, honey, whoever did this,

127
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:42,804
let's rip his tail off
and shove it down his throat.

128
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:50,081
Sir, are we just going to let them
keep raiding our hunts and.. .

129
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:53,280
Put our Alphas on alert.

130
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:54,850
Already done, sir.

131
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,085
Good job.

132
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:08,498
Guys, honestly, caribou is overrated.

133
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:13,603
lnstead, now, keep an open mind,
l just want you to have an open mind here,

134
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:16,869
we bring you berries.

135
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,507
How about squirrels?

136
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:28,081
Bad joke.

137
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:29,677
Flying squirrels.

138
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:04,013
Winston!

139
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:06,914
Tony! You're looking good.

140
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:13,254
My back feels like wood.
l got this disk that keeps cracking.

141
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:15,897
Drives me crazy.

142
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:20,268
Yeah, Tony, you are one crazy wolf.

143
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:22,133
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

144
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:25,534
Like that little game of tag during our hunt.

145
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:28,002
Let's leave the playing to the Omegas.

146
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,041
You know
there's no caribou left in the east.

147
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:32,378
You got a problem.

148
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:37,218
Unite the packs, Winston.
lt was you who gave the big speech

149
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:42,488
that your daughter Kate and my son Garth
would marry and unite the packs.

150
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:48,893
Garth knows his responsibility. Does Kate?

151
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:54,997
Don't worry. She knows.

152
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:56,971
Good.

153
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:01,672
Then she can meet Garth tonight
at the moonlight howl.

154
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:08,680
l won't let my pack starve, Winston.

155
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:12,755
lf we have to, we'll fight for the valley.

156
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,720
That would be a big mistake.

157
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,457
Kate. lt's.. .

158
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:25,834
lt's okay, Dad. l understand. lt's.. .
lt's my responsibility.

159
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,839
Guys, we got to get ready
for the moonlight howl.

160
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,010
Guys, girls.

161
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,709
Girls?

162
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:02,402
You are cool.

163
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:04,702
So, let me go ahead.. .

164
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:09,610
Prepare the girls for your arrival
and you guys meet me there.

165
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:10,943
Game on.

166
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:13,116
Girls.

167
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:25,490
Kate, you look so beautiful.

168
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:28,829
Now, if Garth gets out of line,

169
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:31,495
take those beautiful teeth of yours,

170
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:35,971
go for the throat, and don't let go
until the body stops shaking.

171
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:45,640
lf my little girl doesn't want to do this,
if she's not ready.. .

172
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:49,050
Don't worry, Dad. l'm ready.

173
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,418
Come on, Lilly.

174
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:53,856
Okay. Okay.

175
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:52,474
Your fur.. . lt looks fantastic tonight.

176
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,451
Oh, my gosh. l had.. .

177
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:55,611
Omega alert.

178
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:00,486
l will handle this.

179
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,527
lt totally relaxes the knots.

180
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:03,652
Hey.

181
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,688
Hey.

182
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:10,498
That's all l've got.

183
00:17:14,506 --> 00:17:17,441
Wow. This is a new feeling.

184
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:19,374
l saw the whole thing, guys.

185
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:23,904
And, l cannot believe
they didn't just fall all over you.

186
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:27,782
When you yelled, ''Hey,''
l thought you cinched it right there.

187
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:31,180
So, you think you can do better?

188
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:32,655
Please.

189
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:35,784
The next girl that comes up the hill,
she's mine.

190
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,125
l've never seen her look that good.

191
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:47,568
Kate is hot.

192
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:05,414
l'll be right back.

193
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:07,583
Hey.

194
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:10,160
Where do you think you're going?

195
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:12,287
Humphrey, you know the rules.

196
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:15,197
You're not allowed to howl with her.
She's an Alpha.

197
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:16,632
We can eat together.

198
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:20,398
But we can't, you know, howl together.

199
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:23,100
Guys, l know. l.. . l was just.. .

200
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,104
Kidding.

201
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:32,346
Cheer up, buddy. You still got us.

202
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,817
Friends for life!

203
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:40,654
Ugly.

204
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:45,321
So, do you see Garth?

205
00:18:45,864 --> 00:18:46,853
Great.

206
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:50,798
l'm not even sure what he looks like.
But l'm sure.. .

207
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:55,700
We'll know him when we see him.

208
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:57,765
Hey, Kate.

209
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:00,839
What?

210
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:04,579
Garth.

211
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:07,776
Lilly, stand up.

212
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,049
Garth, hello. Good to see you.

213
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:15,988
-Humphrey?
-My butt! My butt.

214
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:17,085
lt really hurts.

215
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:19,425
You should really do something
about that cough.

216
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:22,092
Be careful, Kate.
There's something going around.

217
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,465
Tails and ears are falling off, literally.

218
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,265
Name's Humphrey.

219
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,600
Garth.

220
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:32,802
Wow. You are a.. .
You are a big one, aren't you?

221
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:35,142
Wow. You're practically a moose.

222
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:36,271
Where you hiding them antlers?

223
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:37,747
Who's the coyote?

224
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:41,447
Who's the coyote? l get it.
That's good, 'cause l'm, like.. .

225
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,147
No one important.

226
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:47,581
Lilly, why don't you take
little coyote Humphrey and run along?

227
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,956
Come on, Humphrey.

228
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:59,060
Let's go eat some of those bitter berries.

229
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:10,503
So, tell me about yourself.

230
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,884
What does Garth like to do?

231
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:18,480
Well, l'm really into fitness, you know?

232
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,054
Rabbit sprints, tree squats.

233
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:32,669
You know us Alphas got to keep fit
to lead the pack.

234
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:36,033
But, what really gets me going is.. .

235
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,324
Was it good for you?

236
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:06,136
Unbelievable.

237
00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:10,602
You know.. .

238
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:15,578
l just.. . Just.. . Hold on a sec
'cause l'm going to be right back.

239
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,778
l.. . l need some water. Some water. Okay?
So, l'll.. . Just.. . Hold on.

240
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:33,289
No worries.
l'll just keep my vocal chords warm.

241
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:34,793
Yeah.

242
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:38,229
''Oh, he's no one important.

243
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:40,897
''Just take little coyote Humphrey
and run along.' '

244
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:42,703
Coyote.

245
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:59,180
-Where's Barf?
-lt's Garth.

246
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:00,884
And we're just taking a little break.

247
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:02,252
A break?

248
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:03,919
What? ls that so strange?

249
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:06,623
No. No, no, no, no. Are you kidding?

250
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:10,429
l always like to take a break
10 minutes into a howl.

251
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,231
Well, l do.

252
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:16,764
Your howling partner, he's not a.. .
He's not a stud.

253
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:20,607
Not a stud but, like, it's like ''stud'' but.. .

254
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:23,171
A dud. A dud. That's it. lsn't he?

255
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,611
No.

256
00:22:27,352 --> 00:22:28,944
He is not a dud.

257
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:34,287
ln fact, Humphrey,
you'd be surprised to find that he is.. .

258
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:38,919
Strong!

259
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:44,128
Yes. Yes! Strong! And he's.. . He's.. .

260
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,696
-Proud!
-Yes! Yes.

261
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,235
Proud. And he's.. .
What's the word l'm looking for?

262
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:53,406
An Alpha's Alpha.

263
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:57,411
That is right! He is an Alpha's Alpha.

264
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:01,615
You make me so mad!

265
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:04,578
Hey, l was just kidding.

266
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,919
You're kind of cute.

267
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:17,195
Really? You think.. . So, wow. Okay. Cute.
Yeah. That's.. . Look.. .

268
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,202
Thank you, first of all,

269
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,173
but do you mean ''Cute'' in, like, a rugged,
kind of handsomely ''Cute''?

270
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:29,041
Again with the butt.
These mosquitoes are out of control.

271
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:33,514
l'll meet you on Mars,

272
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:38,382
right after l eat the Milky Way.

273
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,617
That sounds good.

274
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:47,930
Save some for me.

275
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:55,802
Bag them up, boys. We're going to ldaho.

276
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:57,239
You got it, chief.

277
00:23:57,308 --> 00:24:00,209
Okay. There we go. Watch out there.

278
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:13,249
Kate?

279
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:02,733
Where am l?

280
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:07,144
Humphrey?

281
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:08,736
ls that you?

282
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,542
Kate! Where are we?

283
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:12,882
l don't know.

284
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:14,179
Maybe we're dead.

285
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:18,221
Nope. Definitely not dead.

286
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:21,824
At least they left us some water.

287
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:23,190
You got water?

288
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:25,896
Nope. Definitely not water.

289
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:29,894
Kate, what are you doing?

290
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:32,929
Trying to get out.

291
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:37,132
Calm down.

292
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,608
Listen, maybe they're taking us
to where there's more food.

293
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:41,440
Or maybe we are the food.

294
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:46,315
Kate, you're right. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.

295
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,982
Yeah.

296
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,921
All right. Set them free.

297
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:04,067
Look at them go.

298
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:17,637
Wow.

299
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,544
This isn't Jasper.

300
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,887
Yeah, but it sure does.. . Rock!

301
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:29,084
Quick, get down!

302
00:26:30,828 --> 00:26:32,557
What are they doing?

303
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:36,492
What a smashingly brilliant story this is.

304
00:26:36,768 --> 00:26:41,205
The golfing goose from the low regions
of the Arctic Circle is leading the pack.

305
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:43,740
He's using the wrong club.

306
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:54,117
Could you do me a favor, Needles,
and shut the hole that makes the words?

307
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:59,122
Looks like they're playing
some sort of weird game.

308
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,351
Maybe they can tell us how to get home.

309
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,587
Yeah. And if they can't, we can eat them.

310
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:05,458
Yeah. Follow my lead.

311
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,174
Yeah, l'm right behind you.

312
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:38,984
Now you will see, this shot is mine.

313
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:48,033
Splendid! Wonderful hit, sir.

314
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:00,608
Just a minute!

315
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:17,126
lt's ugly, but a good runner.

316
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,370
Did you see that? Did you see that?

317
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:33,176
l guess the birdie ruined your Birdie.

318
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:35,652
You mark it ''Birdie''
because it would have gone in.

319
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,382
Technically, sir, it might have gone in.

320
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:41,118
That silly bird
stopped my shot from going in.

321
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:43,820
So, l will not take an extra stroke.

322
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:45,487
Mark it Birdie!

323
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:47,326
Well, it.. . lt was an obstacle.

324
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:53,670
And everyone has to play
with the obstacles.

325
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:56,603
You know, we wouldn't want to lie.

326
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:59,404
This is not a lie.
This is not a lie if you are French.

327
00:28:59,477 --> 00:29:04,346
Well, French-Canadian. There's a slash,
a hyphen, in between there.

328
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:07,008
-l say French.
-Canadian.

329
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:08,484
-French.
-Canadian.

330
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:09,781
-French!
-Canadian, sir.

331
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:12,846
May l just say, though,
that you are a wonderful golfer.

332
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:18,988
And you are a very good caddie.

333
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:21,725
Take off!

334
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,096
Paddy, what is wrong with you?

335
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:28,803
Hello.

336
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:31,535
You are two wolves.

337
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:34,169
l have not seen many wolves
in these parts.

338
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:36,873
But l am not afraid of wolves. No.

339
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:38,540
l like wolves.

340
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:43,281
Good. 'Cause we just want to ask you
a few questions.

341
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:46,414
Yes. Quick! Look behind you!

342
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:50,088
Grab him!

343
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:56,632
So, you want to face
the French Resistance?

344
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:58,328
That's French-Canadian!

345
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,727
My butt! My butt! My butt!

346
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:02,528
Omegas.

347
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:06,435
This is not a game anymore!

348
00:30:06,844 --> 00:30:08,277
Don't you wash your feet?

349
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:10,071
Look out for the trees!

350
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,214
Watch that.

351
00:30:13,284 --> 00:30:14,342
Nice one, sir.

352
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:16,511
Gotcha.

353
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:18,646
Oh, no.

354
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:23,421
That's got to hurt.

355
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:26,258
How do you like it now, wolf?

356
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:31,625
Hole in one, sir.

357
00:30:33,938 --> 00:30:36,907
You have bit off more than you can chew
this time, my friend.

358
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:38,339
Help!

359
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,535
My goodness. l.. . Look out for the.. .

360
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:44,508
No. No. No. No. No. No.

361
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:46,345
He's a goner for sure.

362
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:55,524
Wait, what are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

363
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:57,725
Hey, Frank.

364
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,101
Okay. You have a question?

365
00:31:13,177 --> 00:31:15,611
Yeah. Where are we?

366
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,204
ldaho?

367
00:31:17,582 --> 00:31:18,708
lda-who?

368
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:23,051
<i>Oui,</i> ldaho, land of mountains, rivers, lakes,

369
00:31:23,454 --> 00:31:26,048
and a few billion potatoes.

370
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:28,216
Sawtooth National Wilderness.

371
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,123
What are we doing in ldaho?

372
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:34,854
You were relocated to repopulate.

373
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:43,840
They want you big wolves
to make a lot of little wolves.

374
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:47,704
Sounds good to me.
Park shouldn't be without some wolves.

375
00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:50,474
l mean, only for the good of the park.

376
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:54,177
So you two are undomesticated partners?

377
00:31:54,252 --> 00:31:56,812
Paddy, please. Don't be rude.

378
00:31:56,888 --> 00:32:00,790
So, you two are boyfriend, girlfriend?

379
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:03,520
You are an item?

380
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:06,958
-Well.. .
-No.

381
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:09,431
You wolves, you are funny.

382
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,604
We have to get home now.

383
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:17,163
There's going to be trouble
if l don't get back to Jasper.

384
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:19,709
Right. All right. You're freaking out.

385
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:22,871
l'm not freaking out.
l just have to get home.

386
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:25,677
-ls this about Barf?
-lt's Garth.

387
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,311
And it's about responsibilities.
So, l don't expect you to understand.

388
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:31,883
Can you help me?

389
00:32:31,956 --> 00:32:33,423
l need to get home fast.

390
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:35,922
All right, Miss Fast.

391
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:38,619
Where is home sweet home?

392
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:41,424
Jasper Park, Canada.

393
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:46,198
Jasper park? Get out of here.
We love Jasper Park!

394
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,864
Yes, yes. We've toured it many times.

395
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,034
Paddy, please. We've toured it many times.

396
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:54,740
l dated a Pintail from Jasper once.

397
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:58,339
She never stopped quacking.
Drove me nuts.

398
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,316
Drove her right to me.

399
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:02,448
Bound to happen. Bound to happen.

400
00:33:03,087 --> 00:33:05,351
So, you can help me, then, get home.

401
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:10,417
We haven't played Jasper in quite a while.
l think it would be a smashing idea.

402
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:15,365
This is true. So, of course l will help.

403
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,401
l like you two. You make me laugh.

404
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:20,731
And you didn't eat me, so l owe you favor.

405
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:30,906
Where did she go?

406
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:32,779
Maybe l should ask you.

407
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,750
You know that's not my style.

408
00:33:34,986 --> 00:33:37,580
My wolf, Can-do, knows your style.

409
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:42,652
l just want to say one thing.

410
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:46,322
lf any of you wolves
have hurt my daughter,

411
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:52,802
l will personally rip out your eyes
and shove them down your throat

412
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,465
so you can see my claws
tear your carcass open!

413
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:00,966
Mom?

414
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:03,843
Not now, dear. Mommy's in a rage.

415
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:07,482
Well, since Kate stood up Garth,

416
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,746
l could show him around
until she gets back.

417
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,447
l wouldn't say ''Stood up.' '

418
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:14,115
Garth!

419
00:34:14,191 --> 00:34:15,249
Sounds good to me.

420
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:16,554
Well, come on, Garth.

421
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:27,063
lsn't that sweet? She gets it from me.

422
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:32,265
l'll give her till the full moon.

423
00:34:43,187 --> 00:34:45,212
<i>lt is beautiful out there.</i>

424
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,450
<i>Almost makes you want</i>
<i>to hit the potato patch.</i>

425
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:50,789
<i>lf you haven't already hit the outdoors,</i>
<i>get on out your door.</i>

426
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:52,294
<i>The weather today is...</i>

427
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:54,524
Your ride home.

428
00:34:54,598 --> 00:34:55,963
Quick! Get in!

429
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:03,299
What? Boxed up twice in one day.
What are the odds?

430
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:06,737
-Hide!
-Hide!

431
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,480
That right there
is Garn and Debbie Theocarcus.

432
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:16,179
Lucky for you, they travel every year
to Jasper right after Sawtooth.

433
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:20,747
The day's looking pretty,
and so is my woman.

434
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:27,527
This is the song we met to.

435
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:29,896
Come here, you. Let's dance.

436
00:35:31,368 --> 00:35:32,960
-Down here.
-Hurry.

437
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:39,834
Now, he was in a motorcycle gang,
and she was a librarian.

438
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,878
And opposites attract, if you will.

439
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:45,279
Exactly. ln this case,
it was a bookstore that also sold beer.

440
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:46,373
So, they met.

441
00:35:50,387 --> 00:35:51,854
Come on. We have to get in.

442
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:01,826
All right. Here we go.

443
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:10,437
You're just a dream.

444
00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:21,013
l'm like a little bunny. Aren't l, dear?

445
00:36:28,492 --> 00:36:30,084
l love you, Deb.

446
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:32,620
l love you, too.

447
00:36:40,104 --> 00:36:42,334
Get inside now. Get inside. Quick.

448
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:45,000
Well, back in a box.

449
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:51,680
Good luck, you two!

450
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:54,343
We will be watching out for you
from above!

451
00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:57,478
Well, l'll be watching out for you.
He will be breathing heavily.

452
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:20,469
<i>lf we have to, we'll fight for the valley.</i>

453
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,308
Humphrey?

454
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:07,786
So, why is this called
Rabbit Poo Mountain?

455
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,355
Because this is where rabbits like to poo.

456
00:38:13,797 --> 00:38:15,059
l was just kidding.

457
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,065
l get it. You're a funny Omega.

458
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:22,295
Okay. Make me laugh.

459
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:29,710
What am l?

460
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:34,511
You got me.

461
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:37,076
lt's a turtle that fell and can't get up.

462
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:38,651
That's pretty good.

463
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:40,883
Okay. What's this?

464
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:45,093
lt's turtle road kill.

465
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,527
What else can you do?

466
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,066
l just do turtles.

467
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:51,624
Okay, it's my turn.

468
00:38:51,702 --> 00:38:53,192
You want to see something
an Alpha can do?

469
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:56,566
Would my mother approve?

470
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,005
Of course.

471
00:38:58,075 --> 00:38:59,667
Well, okay then.

472
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:18,216
Keep searching.
We must find her before tomorrow night.

473
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,011
Winston?

474
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:43,286
Don't worry, Eve.

475
00:39:43,354 --> 00:39:46,187
She's the finest Alpha l've trained.

476
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:47,917
l'm not, Winston.

477
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:50,983
She's also the finest Alpha
l've ever trained.

478
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:10,445
We stopped.

479
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,059
-What's wrong with you?
-l have to go.

480
00:40:24,128 --> 00:40:26,619
You can't leave. Can't you hold it?

481
00:40:26,697 --> 00:40:27,686
No! l can't.

482
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:29,928
Well, did you try crossing your legs?

483
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,331
-Yes!
-Holding your breath?

484
00:40:31,402 --> 00:40:33,131
Yes! l almost passed out.

485
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:36,604
-Closing your eyes and.. .
-ln or out, l am going.

486
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:40,371
Would you hurry?

487
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:42,742
l can't go when l feel pressured.

488
00:40:42,813 --> 00:40:43,837
Go!

489
00:41:07,104 --> 00:41:09,368
What is he doing?

490
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:13,633
The packaging's wolf-proof.

491
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:28,423
Where is he?

492
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,618
Come on, Humphrey.

493
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:53,707
lt's a rabid wolf!

494
00:41:53,784 --> 00:41:55,217
Max, bring that gun!

495
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:00,688
This is it for you, wolf. Any last wishes?

496
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:15,868
Max, they're getting away!

497
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:17,236
Not if l can help it.

498
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,103
-No!
-We're trapped.

499
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:22,735
l got you both now.

500
00:42:22,813 --> 00:42:24,144
Shoot them!

501
00:42:29,253 --> 00:42:31,050
Nicely done, Max.

502
00:42:59,016 --> 00:43:01,883
Okay.
Thinking with my belly instead of my head,

503
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:05,319
not a good idea. l get it.
l say we build a comfy den.. .

504
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:07,755
-l'm going home.
-Great.

505
00:43:07,824 --> 00:43:10,224
You're going home, and it's raining.

506
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:12,488
l'm not stopping.

507
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,425
<i>Rain, rain, go away</i>

508
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:17,364
<i>Get out of here, rain</i>
<i>No one wants you around</i>

509
00:43:17,434 --> 00:43:18,662
What are you doing?

510
00:43:18,735 --> 00:43:21,203
lt's.. .
lt's a rain dance, to stop it from raining.

511
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,737
<i>'Cause you're wet</i>
<i>And you really are going to ruin our day</i>

512
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:27,299
Humphrey, rain dances make it rain.

513
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:35,374
Right! Well, l'll just do it backwards.

514
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:42,884
That actually worked.

515
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:52,427
Kate?

516
00:43:55,272 --> 00:43:56,830
That's not a good idea.

517
00:43:58,575 --> 00:44:00,167
Hold on, Kate!

518
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:28,593
No!

519
00:44:30,073 --> 00:44:31,631
Hold on, Kate! l'm coming!

520
00:44:35,212 --> 00:44:36,873
Let me think. Let me think.

521
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:44,548
Humphrey!

522
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:51,623
Don't worry, Kate. lt's all part of my plan.

523
00:44:51,695 --> 00:44:53,060
l can see that.

524
00:44:54,831 --> 00:44:56,958
Kate. Kate! Grab my tail.

525
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:58,399
Grab your what?

526
00:44:58,468 --> 00:45:01,301
Take those Alpha jaws and grab.. .

527
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:04,130
My tail. My tail.

528
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:09,610
Kate, wiggle. Wiggle around.

529
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:15,476
That tickles. My tail hurts!

530
00:45:18,488 --> 00:45:20,217
Who knew l was ticklish there?

531
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,053
l can't take any more.

532
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:33,429
No.

533
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:36,568
My gosh. Humphrey! Humphrey!

534
00:45:40,544 --> 00:45:43,479
Your tail. l'm so sorry.

535
00:45:43,547 --> 00:45:45,344
My tail's actually fine,

536
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,713
last time l checked.

537
00:45:55,158 --> 00:45:57,786
Come on. Let's get out of the rain.

538
00:45:57,861 --> 00:45:59,260
Okay.

539
00:46:02,566 --> 00:46:03,897
Thank you.

540
00:46:18,482 --> 00:46:21,212
Sir, we've searched the entire territory.

541
00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:23,917
Still no sign of Kate.

542
00:46:28,391 --> 00:46:29,449
Sir?

543
00:46:30,026 --> 00:46:32,893
We must defend our territory.

544
00:46:56,386 --> 00:46:57,648
Fore!

545
00:47:00,056 --> 00:47:03,321
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

546
00:47:03,393 --> 00:47:05,588
l say, we've caught them
at quite the bad time.

547
00:47:05,662 --> 00:47:07,721
No, l'd say we caught them at a good time.

548
00:47:07,798 --> 00:47:09,493
lndeed, sir. lndeed.

549
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:11,399
What are you doing here?

550
00:47:11,468 --> 00:47:14,562
No, the question
is what are you doing here?

551
00:47:14,638 --> 00:47:17,402
l give you a first class ticket home.. .

552
00:47:17,474 --> 00:47:19,032
lt's a straight shot right to the pin.

553
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:20,599
-And you blow it?
-Yep.

554
00:47:21,678 --> 00:47:23,145
Over a cupcake.

555
00:47:23,814 --> 00:47:25,873
Ridiculous dessert. ''A cupcake.' '

556
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:27,382
Actually, they're quite delicious.

557
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:30,542
There has to be another way
for us to get to Jasper.

558
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,612
Another way? Another way?

559
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,591
Always another way.
What am l, a travel agent?

560
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:38,788
Come on. What, are you kidding me?

561
00:47:38,862 --> 00:47:42,593
A great sportsman like yourself
always knows a few ways to win the game.

562
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:45,658
Well, there could be a train.

563
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:48,329
Actually, there is a train.
lt's the Canadian Express and.. .

564
00:47:48,405 --> 00:47:50,873
Paddy, please.
lt's called the Canadian Express.. .

565
00:47:50,941 --> 00:47:52,738
Yes, and it shoots right by Jasper Park.

566
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:54,936
Right by Jasper Park.

567
00:47:55,011 --> 00:47:56,706
-lf you can catch it.. .
-You'll be home in no time.

568
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,008
No time. Very fast.

569
00:47:58,081 --> 00:48:00,379
Great. So where do we board?

570
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,418
Where do you board?

571
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:03,850
Watch this.

572
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,122
On the other side of that mountain.

573
00:48:10,193 --> 00:48:11,626
Paddy, please.

574
00:48:11,695 --> 00:48:13,162
Come on!

575
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:17,132
Let it slip, but may l say,
that was a stupendous shot.

576
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,828
You may,
and it was pretty good, wasn't it?

577
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:21,598
lndeed, sir. lndeed.

578
00:48:39,456 --> 00:48:41,686
Dinner for two.

579
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:45,021
lt's a new move
l've been working on for stalking prey.

580
00:48:45,595 --> 00:48:46,892
You're good.

581
00:48:46,963 --> 00:48:49,898
Thanks. Now you try.

582
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,200
No. l.. .

583
00:48:52,502 --> 00:48:54,197
l'm not much of a hunter.

584
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,398
Come on. You'll do great.

585
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,501
Just do what l do.

586
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:00,600
Okay.

587
00:49:02,012 --> 00:49:03,036
Ready?

588
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,814
-One.
-One.

589
00:49:05,882 --> 00:49:07,679
-Two.
-Two.

590
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,150
Three!

591
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:16,687
Lilly!

592
00:49:22,532 --> 00:49:23,829
Lilly?

593
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,668
A turtle, right?

594
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:32,738
l told you, l don't hunt.

595
00:49:38,114 --> 00:49:40,173
Maybe this will help.

596
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,982
Wow.

597
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:46,784
''Wow'' what?

598
00:49:46,856 --> 00:49:48,187
Your eyes.

599
00:49:48,258 --> 00:49:49,691
They're beautiful.

600
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,091
Come on. Let's try again.

601
00:50:02,105 --> 00:50:03,936
-lt sure is pretty out there.
-Yeah.

602
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:08,073
-l'll race you to the top.
-You're on.

603
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:12,573
Give it up, Humphrey! You'll never beat me.

604
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:18,447
Humphrey?

605
00:50:23,093 --> 00:50:25,391
Omega one, Alpha zero!

606
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:29,829
Okay! Okay!

607
00:50:29,899 --> 00:50:32,993
Enough, enough! Stop! Stop!
l get it. l get it. l get it.

608
00:50:33,536 --> 00:50:35,561
How's that for a girl's throw?

609
00:50:35,638 --> 00:50:36,900
Very funny.

610
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:41,436
Well, look who's having fun.

611
00:50:43,113 --> 00:50:45,809
You know, l should go check on the train.

612
00:50:45,882 --> 00:50:47,611
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait.

613
00:50:48,918 --> 00:50:50,351
Hi, there.

614
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,513
What are you?

615
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:54,420
Well, l'm a wolf.

616
00:50:54,491 --> 00:50:58,222
l've never seen a wolf.
You are really strange.

617
00:50:58,661 --> 00:51:01,027
Am l now?

618
00:51:01,898 --> 00:51:03,331
You're totally weird.

619
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,803
l'm going to get you!

620
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:16,173
No. Look out! Look out!

621
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:22,544
Okay, you asked for it.

622
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:31,554
No, no, no. lt's okay. lt's okay.

623
00:51:32,328 --> 00:51:33,818
l'm really sorry.

624
00:51:39,202 --> 00:51:40,533
Oh, poo.

625
00:51:45,842 --> 00:51:47,002
Mad.. .

626
00:51:47,677 --> 00:51:48,666
Mad bear.

627
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:52,441
Kate! Get the snowballs ready!
Mad bear on the attack!

628
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,078
The Canadian Express!
Humphrey, the train is coming!

629
00:52:01,157 --> 00:52:02,556
Kate!

630
00:52:02,926 --> 00:52:04,291
Humphrey?

631
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:08,723
What's wrong with you?

632
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:10,555
That!

633
00:52:15,371 --> 00:52:17,202
Don't move. We can handle this.

634
00:52:17,273 --> 00:52:18,262
We can?

635
00:52:21,678 --> 00:52:23,009
Okay, we're in trouble.

636
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,607
Guys. You guys like jokes? Good.

637
00:52:27,684 --> 00:52:32,383
So, okay. So two bears are eating a clown,
and one of the bears says,

638
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:34,753
''Does this taste funny to you?''

639
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:42,625
A simple ''Boo'' would have sufficed.

640
00:52:43,933 --> 00:52:44,922
Man.

641
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,082
Watch this. One more. One more.

642
00:53:06,122 --> 00:53:07,646
Get up. Kate, get up.

643
00:53:12,228 --> 00:53:16,358
Where are those two?
Why must they make this so difficult?

644
00:53:16,432 --> 00:53:19,094
l believe the term is
''high maintenance couple,'' sir.

645
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:31,513
Stuck between the cliffs and the claws.
This isn't good.

646
00:53:39,689 --> 00:53:41,680
Good luck joking your way out of this one.

647
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:43,818
What's your name, sir?

648
00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:46,728
Growl. All right.

649
00:53:53,403 --> 00:53:54,597
Do you need a hug?

650
00:53:56,906 --> 00:53:58,874
Why don't we talk? Can we just talk?

651
00:54:02,745 --> 00:54:04,076
Good talk!

652
00:54:36,312 --> 00:54:37,540
Hey, need a ride?

653
00:54:38,982 --> 00:54:41,075
Jump! Trust me!

654
00:54:44,954 --> 00:54:46,615
l told you, you could trust me.

655
00:54:48,725 --> 00:54:50,158
Hang a left!

656
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:55,225
Go right!

657
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,409
Why are you looking at me like that?

658
00:55:15,118 --> 00:55:18,246
Unbelievable. They have missed the train.

659
00:55:24,727 --> 00:55:26,058
Or not.

660
00:55:49,118 --> 00:55:52,212
-l know. lt's not very good, is it?
-Well.. .

661
00:55:55,558 --> 00:55:58,186
That was so awesome.
You with the snowballs.

662
00:55:59,195 --> 00:56:03,791
And you with that little bear
in that snowball fight. lt was so cute.

663
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:08,130
But then you with the log!

664
00:56:08,204 --> 00:56:10,138
The look on your face was so good.

665
00:56:10,907 --> 00:56:11,965
And then we.. .

666
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,269
You know, we make a pretty good team.

667
00:56:17,347 --> 00:56:20,874
Kate and Humphrey, world adventurers!
What do you think?

668
00:56:21,584 --> 00:56:22,846
l think you're crazy.

669
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:24,284
You think l'm.. .

670
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:27,255
No, l'm telling you,
we're onto something here.

671
00:56:27,323 --> 00:56:28,813
Stick with me, pup. We'll go places.

672
00:56:30,626 --> 00:56:32,491
Well, l'll keep that in mind.

673
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:39,435
All right. Take a deep breath.

674
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:43,566
Howl from right here.

675
00:56:46,442 --> 00:56:47,875
And l'll join in.

676
00:57:03,626 --> 00:57:04,991
Humphrey,

677
00:57:05,828 --> 00:57:07,489
what are you doing?

678
00:57:07,563 --> 00:57:11,226
l'm sorry. The moon, the moment.
l just thought.. .

679
00:57:12,535 --> 00:57:16,096
Come on, Kate. Howl at the moon with me.

680
00:59:01,143 --> 00:59:02,701
See? That's so good.

681
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:10,844
No. You better go.

682
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,979
But no one has to know.

683
00:59:13,055 --> 00:59:15,888
Please. Go, now.

684
00:59:18,027 --> 00:59:19,016
No.

685
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:23,323
Dad.

686
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:28,499
Howling with an Omega, are we?

687
00:59:28,571 --> 00:59:30,539
-l was just.. .
-Get with the others.

688
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,300
What's going on?

689
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:34,138
We're going to take the valley,

690
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:36,640
and our caribou.

691
00:59:48,691 --> 00:59:50,625
-Dad!
-Lilly, what's wrong?

692
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:52,820
The Eastern Wolves. They're coming!

693
00:59:53,729 --> 00:59:54,957
Come on!

694
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,308
Just do it.
She howled at the moon with you.

695
01:00:13,015 --> 01:00:14,414
That was just the moment.

696
01:00:14,884 --> 01:00:17,250
<i>Bonjour,</i> my furry friend.

697
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:19,280
What?

698
01:00:23,826 --> 01:00:24,850
Are you guys crazy?

699
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:26,189
That's up for debate.

700
01:00:26,262 --> 01:00:30,164
And where is.. . <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

701
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:31,529
She's sleeping, so be quiet.

702
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:33,064
Yes. Quiet.

703
01:00:45,514 --> 01:00:46,879
What are you guys doing here?

704
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:50,350
Making sure that you don't forget
the run of the course.

705
01:00:50,419 --> 01:00:53,479
Jasper Park, it is a few miles up.

706
01:00:53,756 --> 01:00:55,621
Do not miss it.

707
01:00:55,691 --> 01:00:57,522
Jasper, few miles, got it.

708
01:00:57,593 --> 01:00:58,719
Good.

709
01:00:58,794 --> 01:01:03,493
l've got to say, your girlfriend
looks quite pretty when she sleeps.

710
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:06,200
She's not my girlfriend.

711
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:11,068
You should work on that.

712
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:41,462
lt's the full moon, Winston.

713
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:44,497
l can see that, Tony.

714
01:01:45,007 --> 01:01:47,373
l didn't want it to come to this.

715
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,836
But here we are.

716
01:01:48,911 --> 01:01:51,641
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

717
01:01:52,248 --> 01:01:55,445
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

718
01:01:55,518 --> 01:01:58,214
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

719
01:02:25,214 --> 01:02:26,306
Kate.

720
01:02:27,717 --> 01:02:29,617
Kate, wake up. Wake up.

721
01:02:30,486 --> 01:02:33,546
Humphrey? Where are we?

722
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,081
We're.. . We're in Jasper.

723
01:02:46,535 --> 01:02:47,695
We're home.

724
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,295
Yup. We're home.

725
01:02:51,774 --> 01:02:53,332
-There's something.. .
-There's something.. .

726
01:02:53,876 --> 01:02:55,468
Please, you first.

727
01:02:56,645 --> 01:02:58,636
Humphrey, l just wanted to tell you,

728
01:02:58,714 --> 01:03:01,706
these past couple of days,
they've been, kind of,

729
01:03:03,018 --> 01:03:04,076
fun.

730
01:03:05,321 --> 01:03:08,347
You've been, kind of, fun.

731
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:10,485
Really?

732
01:03:11,494 --> 01:03:12,859
Really.

733
01:03:12,928 --> 01:03:15,897
Well, that's.. . That's great.

734
01:03:15,965 --> 01:03:18,627
l told you, we make a pretty good team.

735
01:03:19,435 --> 01:03:20,925
We do.

736
01:03:23,706 --> 01:03:25,071
Okay.

737
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:29,268
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
You have to go to the bathroom again.

738
01:03:29,345 --> 01:03:31,074
Why, do you see a truck stop?

739
01:03:33,249 --> 01:03:36,514
l just wanted to tell you l.. . l.. .

740
01:03:39,221 --> 01:03:42,019
-l.. . l just wanted to tell you.. .
-No.

741
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:43,854
l.. . l love.. .

742
01:03:45,027 --> 01:03:46,358
Oh, geez.

743
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:56,698
All l asked was for you
to follow our customs, unite the packs.

744
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,975
But, no.
Your daughter had to up and run away.

745
01:04:01,043 --> 01:04:02,203
l didn't run away.

746
01:04:05,614 --> 01:04:06,774
Kate!

747
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:08,248
She's back!

748
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,390
-We were so worried.
-Where have you been?

749
01:04:20,796 --> 01:04:22,923
-ln ldaho.
-ldaho?

750
01:04:23,399 --> 01:04:25,230
What were you doing in ldaho?

751
01:04:25,634 --> 01:04:28,330
We were taken by humans to another park.

752
01:04:28,404 --> 01:04:30,929
We were supposed to repopulate.

753
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:37,579
No, no, no. Mom. We didn't repopulate.

754
01:04:37,646 --> 01:04:40,171
Humphrey actually helped me get home.

755
01:04:45,221 --> 01:04:46,882
What a nice boy.

756
01:04:47,423 --> 01:04:51,519
-l came back.. .
-You came back to marry Garth.

757
01:04:58,434 --> 01:04:59,423
Yes.

758
01:05:01,403 --> 01:05:03,166
And unite the packs!

759
01:05:15,985 --> 01:05:18,579
Good for the pack, good for the belly.

760
01:05:39,275 --> 01:05:42,506
Marry? You're getting married?

761
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:46,113
Yes. lsn't it great?

762
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:51,819
No more fighting during hunts.
No more scraps and bones at dinnertime.

763
01:05:52,354 --> 01:05:54,219
We're going to unite the packs.

764
01:06:04,066 --> 01:06:05,624
Welcome back, Humphrey.

765
01:06:05,701 --> 01:06:07,726
Good job bringing her home.

766
01:06:29,191 --> 01:06:32,490
Wow. lt's a big crowd.

767
01:06:33,362 --> 01:06:35,330
Yeah. Good times.

768
01:06:35,965 --> 01:06:38,934
So l heard
you and Garth spent some time together.

769
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:41,127
Lilly.

770
01:06:41,203 --> 01:06:42,227
Sorry.

771
01:06:42,304 --> 01:06:44,636
l'm sure he's perfect marrying material.

772
01:06:47,142 --> 01:06:53,604
Well, if you like that sort of thing,
big, brawny, and perfect.

773
01:06:56,018 --> 01:06:57,883
Lilly, you're wearing your fur back.

774
01:06:58,721 --> 01:07:01,155
Sorry. l know.

775
01:07:03,592 --> 01:07:05,617
But, l liked it.

776
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,857
Right on the pin.

777
01:07:10,566 --> 01:07:12,090
Marcel! Paddy!

778
01:07:12,568 --> 01:07:16,299
When it comes to hugs,
we are all French, Paddy?

779
01:07:16,405 --> 01:07:18,873
Well, l'm English, so we don't hug!

780
01:07:19,675 --> 01:07:22,143
But for a first, l'd say that was a good one.

781
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:24,270
l'm so happy to see you two.

782
01:07:24,346 --> 01:07:26,280
We flew in to see that you made it home.

783
01:07:26,348 --> 01:07:28,111
And what do we find?

784
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:32,518
-You're getting married!
-You're getting married!

785
01:07:34,423 --> 01:07:37,017
Yeah. l'm getting married.

786
01:07:37,092 --> 01:07:38,889
-Who told you?
-l did.

787
01:07:40,362 --> 01:07:41,829
Humphrey.

788
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:44,231
We should be going.

789
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:45,561
Yes, yes.

790
01:07:51,006 --> 01:07:53,474
Excuse me. A flea.

791
01:07:54,643 --> 01:07:57,077
And a little something for your big day.

792
01:07:58,180 --> 01:07:59,579
Thank you.

793
01:07:59,648 --> 01:08:01,081
Just wanted to say good-bye.

794
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:02,681
Good-bye?

795
01:08:02,751 --> 01:08:05,049
Yeah. l'm thinking
about doing a little traveling,

796
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,213
you know, seeing where the train takes me.

797
01:08:08,157 --> 01:08:09,784
And maybe l'll visit our friends the bears.

798
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,923
Our old buddies, see how they're doing.

799
01:08:13,629 --> 01:08:15,062
l'll tell them you said hi.

800
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,429
Wait. But you're leaving Jasper?

801
01:08:20,035 --> 01:08:23,630
Yeah. You know, it's a lone wolf thing.

802
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,403
l know Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega,

803
01:08:29,111 --> 01:08:31,909
not Humphrey, the lone wolf.

804
01:08:32,448 --> 01:08:34,848
So l'll be a fun-loving lone wolf.

805
01:08:40,889 --> 01:08:42,584
l don't doubt that.

806
01:08:45,394 --> 01:08:48,124
You know, Marcel,
l am a stickler for tradition,

807
01:08:48,197 --> 01:08:50,791
but this one, l just don't understand.

808
01:08:51,767 --> 01:08:54,930
These wolves are mysterious creatures.

809
01:09:10,853 --> 01:09:12,081
Tony.

810
01:09:12,888 --> 01:09:13,980
So.. .

811
01:09:16,558 --> 01:09:18,048
Are you ready?

812
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:19,919
Yes.

813
01:09:20,596 --> 01:09:21,688
Good.

814
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:25,366
Are you okay?

815
01:09:26,635 --> 01:09:27,932
You bet.

816
01:09:28,003 --> 01:09:29,868
No problems on this end.

817
01:09:29,938 --> 01:09:32,099
Ready to go, go, go.

818
01:09:35,978 --> 01:09:38,003
So, you want to start this thing or me?

819
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,342
We'll start together.

820
01:09:39,815 --> 01:09:41,715
Start together. Yeah.

821
01:09:41,783 --> 01:09:44,445
So, what's happening?

822
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,218
They're accepting each other's scent.

823
01:09:48,991 --> 01:09:51,357
And now, the nibble on the ears.

824
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:56,522
Do you think l can make it?

825
01:09:56,598 --> 01:10:01,001
Yes, sir, and just as you hit the tracks,
you should see an open train car.

826
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:06,336
Well, avoid truck stops, bears, and that
hideous dessert. What is it called?

827
01:10:06,408 --> 01:10:08,876
-Cupcakes, sir.
-Yes. Cupcakes.

828
01:10:08,944 --> 01:10:11,139
l will. Thanks, guys.

829
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,278
You know, you shouldn't be so judgmental
about cupcakes.

830
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:15,873
They really are quite delicious.

831
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:17,543
l wouldn't know.

832
01:10:19,154 --> 01:10:24,182
And finally, they will rub noses
to symbolize that they are

833
01:10:25,894 --> 01:10:26,883
mates!

834
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,338
Kate, what are you doing?

835
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:48,207
l.. .

836
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:53,053
l can't.

837
01:10:53,488 --> 01:10:54,819
You can't!

838
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:58,749
l mean, you can't?

839
01:10:59,328 --> 01:11:02,195
What is this, Winston?
Why can't she marry Garth?

840
01:11:02,264 --> 01:11:03,424
Quiet.

841
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,364
Kate, Kate. Why can't you marry Garth?

842
01:11:08,036 --> 01:11:09,765
Because l.. .

843
01:11:11,673 --> 01:11:15,165
l fell in love with an Omega.

844
01:11:15,611 --> 01:11:16,942
An Omega?

845
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:21,577
Humphrey? That sly dog!

846
01:11:35,697 --> 01:11:39,394
An Alpha in love with an Omega.
That's against pack law.

847
01:11:39,468 --> 01:11:40,730
Dad.

848
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,639
l also am in love with an Omega.

849
01:11:45,941 --> 01:11:47,033
What?

850
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:51,736
What have you done to my son, Winston?

851
01:11:51,813 --> 01:11:54,611
An Omega and an Alpha?
An Alpha and an Omega?

852
01:11:54,683 --> 01:11:56,844
Eve, help me out.

853
01:12:01,156 --> 01:12:05,092
This is madness. This isn't our custom.

854
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,994
This isn't our way. Take the valley!

855
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,240
l just love weddings!

856
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:39,821
Stampede! Stampede!

857
01:12:39,895 --> 01:12:42,728
Everyone, run! Run!

858
01:12:42,798 --> 01:12:44,993
To the sides of the valley!

859
01:12:53,975 --> 01:12:56,739
lt's that darn disk in my back.

860
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,577
Come on!

861
01:13:09,191 --> 01:13:11,182
No! They're trapped!

862
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:20,427
Humphrey!

863
01:13:20,502 --> 01:13:21,526
Kate!

864
01:13:21,603 --> 01:13:22,797
We have to help them!

865
01:13:24,639 --> 01:13:25,731
Look!

866
01:13:33,215 --> 01:13:34,807
Faster, Tony! Faster!

867
01:13:47,863 --> 01:13:49,125
Go left!

868
01:13:51,066 --> 01:13:52,590
Roll right!

869
01:13:55,036 --> 01:13:56,526
You're getting good at this.

870
01:13:56,605 --> 01:13:58,038
l had a good teacher.

871
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,135
They're too far ahead. We'll never make it.

872
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:04,508
Hold on.

873
01:14:12,621 --> 01:14:13,610
Look!

874
01:14:24,332 --> 01:14:25,993
World adventurers.

875
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:27,728
l told you we'd make a good team.

876
01:14:27,803 --> 01:14:29,998
Did you say that? l thought l said that.

877
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,102
Kate!

878
01:15:00,235 --> 01:15:01,930
Kate. Kate.

879
01:15:06,274 --> 01:15:07,673
Please, Kate.

880
01:15:09,778 --> 01:15:11,439
Please, you can't do this.

881
01:15:22,724 --> 01:15:24,089
l love you.

882
01:16:16,244 --> 01:16:17,336
Kate!

883
01:16:21,683 --> 01:16:22,945
Humphrey?

884
01:16:23,785 --> 01:16:24,877
l thought l'd lost you.

885
01:16:33,194 --> 01:16:34,684
ls everyone staring at us?

886
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:39,333
Well, no, not.. . Not every.. . Well, yeah.
Now they are.

887
01:16:40,435 --> 01:16:43,268
Darn. 'Cause l wanted to tell you something.

888
01:16:47,509 --> 01:16:48,601
What?

889
01:16:50,946 --> 01:16:52,072
Really?

890
01:16:54,015 --> 01:16:57,507
Okay.
Well, l wanted to tell you something, too.

891
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:09,491
Maybe this can work.

892
01:17:15,003 --> 01:17:16,493
All right.

893
01:17:16,571 --> 01:17:17,731
Garth!

894
01:17:28,717 --> 01:17:32,585
Tony, what do two old wolves do
after they retire?

895
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:38,091
Gentlemen, may l introduce you to golf?

896
01:17:41,963 --> 01:17:42,952
Fore!

897
01:17:55,644 --> 01:17:57,009
Yeah, yeah.
