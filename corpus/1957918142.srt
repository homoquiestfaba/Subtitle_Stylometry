1
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,177
Greed has consumed you, Abel.

2
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:11,596
Go. Seek penance.

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,183
Reveal your worth.

4
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,602
Victoria?

5
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,585
Now what?

6
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:35,544
Victoria?

7
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,680
What a miserable life you covet.

8
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,560
What's going on?

9
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,645
What is this place?

10
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,232
Your greed will see you trapped here.

11
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,652
Eternally bound by your own ignorance.

12
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:02,321
No, please.

13
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,407
You have to forgive me.

14
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,118
I want to be with you.

15
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,079
Then release yourself.

16
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,678
No, no, no, no!

17
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,333
Victoria?

18
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,462
You are now complete,

19
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,425
but you are not yet finished.

20
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,176
For your world is plagued by

21
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,179
corruption of your own design.

22
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,223
Sloth.

23
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,682
Pride.

24
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:37,184
Envy.

25
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,561
Lust.

26
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,396
Gluttony.

27
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,521
Wrath.

28
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:42,982
And greed.

29
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,151
What is this?

30
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,904
A chance to redeem mankind.

31
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,490
To dissuade extinction.

32
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,368
Death here is eternal,

33
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,581
and failure the end of your race.

34
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,248
Go.

35
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,419
Seek penance.

36
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,633
Reveal your worth.
