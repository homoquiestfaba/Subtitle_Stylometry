1
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:15,551
Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.

2
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,622
They're crap, squirrel.
They fall apart before you're out of the door.

3
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:21,181
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!

4
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:23,076
Please.

5
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:26,589
My sister, she's very, very sick.

6
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:29,661
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

7
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,635
- Do you know my mother?
- No.

8
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,189
She's very, very sick.

9
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:38,170
I'll give you two.

10
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,529
That's a bad idea, you know.

11
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,912
Like feeding pigeons.

12
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:52,319
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.

13
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:54,776
I work for a private collector
of rare antiquities.

14
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:57,949
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.

15
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:59,873
And I didn't answer.

16
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:03,233
There's been a discovery
in East Africa.

17
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,786
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

18
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:08,378
No, it's not possible.

19
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,905
The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity at that time...

20
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,246
but they never got that far south.

21
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,996
Nevertheless, there it sits.

22
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,847
The British have financed
a dig to uncover this church.

23
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:20,985
We believe a rare object waits inside.

24
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:24,122
We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

25
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:26,526
So you think I'm a thief?

26
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:33,148
Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

27
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:35,800
No. Simply a man
who's lost faith...

28
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,910
in everything except himself.

29
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:40,829
Ah.
You know nothing about me.

30
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:43,032
You're an Oxford-educated
archaeologist...

31
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:45,174
an expert in religious icons.

32
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,922
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?

33
00:05:56,701 --> 00:06:00,050
This is a leather impression of
the artifact we're looking for...

34
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:03,866
a representation
of a mythical demon.

35
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:24,367
It's Sumerian. What makes you
think it's in a church in Africa?

36
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:27,027
A Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

37
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:29,879
He's been persuaded to let you join it.

38
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:32,629
You're assuming that I will say yes.

39
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:35,152
You already have.

40
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:39,567
March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.

41
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,226
Left. Left, right, left.

42
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:45,644
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

43
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,541
Left.

44
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,836
Left, right, left.

45
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:53,620
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

46
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:05,263
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.

47
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:12,430
Beautiful, aren't they?

48
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,283
It's a hobby from school days.

49
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:17,585
Works wonders for the nerves.

50
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,888
You should try it sometime.

51
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,726
What can you tell me about the dig?

52
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:28,653
The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district...

53
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:30,511
called Derati.

54
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:34,059
It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men...

55
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:35,985
on maneuvers there.

56
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,312
When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

57
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,719
What have they learned so far?

58
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:48,136
That it's a church
where no church should be.

59
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,510
This is Father Francis.

60
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:53,097
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

61
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:56,038
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

62
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:59,211
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.

63
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,501
I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

64
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:08,302
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you
didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.

65
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:11,683
I was actually headed to Kenya
to begin missionary work...

66
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,668
when Rome learned of the discovery.

67
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,866
They've asked me to make sure the site's
religious aspect have the proper consideration.

68
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,138
Hmm.

69
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:23,075
How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

70
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,840
We haven't...

71
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:27,014
officially.

72
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:29,802
You're both my guests.

73
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:33,098
Tell me, have you any theories
on who might have built this church?

74
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:35,237
Well, not until I've seen it.

75
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,374
Surely the Vatican has
some record of its creation.

76
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:41,444
I'm afraid not.

77
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:43,850
We're as in the dark
about it as you are.

78
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:02,209
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.

79
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,478
The British hired me as an interpreter.

80
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:12,036
What happened here?

81
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:15,400
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.

82
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:19,075
- How many died?
- All of them.

83
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,692
I'm Lancaster Merrin.

84
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:20,828
Major Granville should have contacted you
about my joining the dig.

85
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:24,246
He did.

86
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:28,480
Is something bothering you, mate?

87
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:33,110
No.

88
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:36,567
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?

89
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,844
I shouldn't...

90
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:41,301
but my will is weak.

91
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:45,081
Then you might just survive this place.

92
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,177
I understand you've uncovered
the church dome...

93
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,516
but that progress has slowed down.

94
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,470
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?

95
00:10:57,118 --> 00:11:00,466
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster... Lancaster Merrin.

96
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:05,140
You still haven't made it
by my room, Doctor.

97
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:09,523
I've been having this, uh,
swelling in the evening.

98
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:12,498
Thought you might have
something I could put on it.

99
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,427
How about a muzzle?

100
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,420
So how are the interior
excavations coming along?

101
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:24,858
- They're not.
- No?

102
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:26,996
Has the structure collapsed?

103
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,106
No, the church is perfect...

104
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:31,764
but none of the men will enter,
those we have left anyway.

105
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,103
Why's that?

106
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,475
I shall be leaving
for the dig in five minutes.

107
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:48,338
Well... pleasant fellow.

108
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:50,710
What's wrong with his face?

109
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,875
Other than that it's
attached to his body?

110
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:57,107
Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind of localized infection.

111
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,950
Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

112
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:03,884
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.

113
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,959
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?

114
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,732
No. I'm a doctor.

115
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:13,676
But as a priest,
surely you must believe in such things.

116
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,692
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.

117
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,675
Now, that's funny.

118
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,466
I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

119
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,762
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.

120
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,504
Father Merrin.

121
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,460
This is Emekwi.

122
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,980
He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

123
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:38,735
Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

124
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:42,381
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.

125
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:45,385
- Hello, James, Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.

126
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,426
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.

127
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:51,182
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.

128
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,770
James. Joseph.

129
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,098
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.

130
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,538
There's your goddamn church.

131
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:56,742
Is this your first assignment, Father?

132
00:13:56,811 --> 00:14:00,008
Before this, I was studying
in the archives in the Holy Sea.

133
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:02,377
The Vatican.
Impressive.

134
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:05,312
But not really training
for missionary work, is it?

135
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,580
This is strange.

136
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:31,910
It's 1,500 years old.

137
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:34,180
It should be badly weathered.

138
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,142
It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

139
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:41,085
Chuma.

140
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,225
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.

141
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:50,847
Hyenas?

142
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,958
They've been here
ever since we started digging.

143
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,900
Even at daytime?

144
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:01,820
No! No! No!

145
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:06,685
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

146
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:09,724
The heat?

147
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,970
Joseph?

148
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:33,687
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

149
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:37,078
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.

150
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:40,252
I think you're about
ready for this now.

151
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,953
It's a tool for professional diggers.

152
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:47,195
Wow.

153
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,967
His seizure's stopped.

154
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:54,901
I wanted to keep him at the hospital
for observation...

155
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,845
but the Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

156
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:02,037
Well, that must make
your job very hard.

157
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,020
You have no idea.

158
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:08,310
Thank you.

159
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:11,164
So what is it you hope to find here?

160
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,769
The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.

161
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:20,923
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

162
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,477
Black bastards!
Bloody savages!

163
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,927
Can't wipe their own ass
without instruction.

164
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:30,844
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.

165
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,355
I, uh... I found this...

166
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,567
and, uh, I want you to have it.

167
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:39,505
It's a St. Joseph, for luck.

168
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,577
Please, for my behavior.

169
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:52,086
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?

170
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:55,253
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!

171
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,907
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.

172
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:03,152
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.

173
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:05,298
It's okay. Come.

174
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,757
These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

175
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:09,687
How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

176
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,442
A few days.

177
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:15,189
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.

178
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:17,589
Chuma'll take you in
through the roof.

179
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,326
Following us, Father?

180
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:33,165
Is it safe to walk around?

181
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:35,141
Let's see.

182
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:56,904
Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.

183
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:59,842
Cast out after the war in heaven.

184
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:02,219
Can't even trust angels, can you?

185
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:16,872
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.

186
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,675
It's odd.

187
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,421
Churches were built to exalt heaven...

188
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,166
but this, the weapons
are pointing downward.

189
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:37,672
Look behind you, Father.

190
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:55,426
Desecration of Christ.

191
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,220
Who would do something like this?

192
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:09,699
The crucifix
was broken off from here.

193
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:12,132
Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

194
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:14,020
I wouldn't know.

195
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:16,573
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.

196
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:20,289
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

197
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:23,935
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.

198
00:20:24,004 --> 00:20:26,687
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

199
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,895
He's gone mad.

200
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:38,139
No one's been inside Bession's tent
since he fell ill?

201
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:41,058
They are superstitious.

202
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:48,190
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.

203
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:48,759
- Chuma.
- Yes?

204
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:52,722
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.

205
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:59,856
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.

206
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:03,127
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?

207
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:05,682
The language spoken in Palestine
at the time of Christ.

208
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:08,917
And what does it say?

209
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:10,840
The fallen shall rise...

210
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:13,523
in a river of blood."

211
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,259
Do you have a moment?

212
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:53,075
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?

213
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:55,955
Or maybe something
more substantial?

214
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,159
Yes, that would be very nice.

215
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,810
You dabble in the occult?

216
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,734
I found them here when I arrived.

217
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:14,897
I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

218
00:23:17,107 --> 00:23:19,528
You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

219
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:26,987
There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

220
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:29,424
He had no medical symptoms...

221
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,962
nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

222
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,132
His breakdown was purely mental
and extremely severe.

223
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,917
That's why the Turkana fear
the church is cursed.

224
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:42,253
That and the disappearances.

225
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,037
In the past few weeks,
we've lost a dozen men.

226
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:47,438
Runaways?

227
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:49,391
Or is it those evil spirits?

228
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:51,365
Yeah.

229
00:24:00,783 --> 00:24:05,539
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.

230
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:08,680
My father was a strong man.

231
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,270
When the Nazis started
rounding up the Jews in our town...

232
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:14,244
he didn't hesitate.

233
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:16,357
He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

234
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:18,436
But someone turned us in...

235
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:21,323
and we were all sent to
the concentration camps.

236
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:23,047
I'm sorry.

237
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:26,695
People can't really
understand, can they?

238
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:29,284
If they weren't there...

239
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,624
if they didn't see.

240
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:33,601
No.

241
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,823
And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

242
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,843
I met him after the war,
and we came to Africa together, in love.

243
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:47,743
One night I realized
I... I had to tell him the truth...

244
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:50,207
about... the Nazis...

245
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:53,151
and what they did to me.

246
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:56,706
After that, he never touched me again.

247
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:59,940
So...

248
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:02,910
what turns a man of the cloth
into an archaeologist?

249
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,262
I don't know.
I suppose I...

250
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:11,492
I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

251
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,926
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.

252
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:16,064
No.

253
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:19,364
There's no point in that.

254
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:22,496
Sometimes I think
the best view of God is from hell.

255
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:32,699
I should get to bed.

256
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:39,266
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow
to see Bession.

257
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:43,679
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?

258
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:46,137
He runs the sanitarium.

259
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,895
Well, thank you...

260
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:51,614
for the medical care.

261
00:25:56,738 --> 00:25:59,040
Deliver us from evil...

262
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:01,921
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

263
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:04,158
Amen.

264
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,255
You, priest.
What is your name?

265
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:40,630
I'm Father Merrin.

266
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:59,090
God is not here today, priest.

267
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:25,899
Want some water?

268
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:35,217
Hey, what's wrong?

269
00:28:43,282 --> 00:28:45,191
It's late.

270
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,404
You should go back to bed.

271
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:58,287
Give it to me! It's mine!

272
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,971
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!

273
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,887
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Here, take it.

274
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,675
- Take it!
- Oh, just give it to me, you idiot!

275
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,678
Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.

276
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:10,410
Give it to me!
It's mine.

277
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,097
- Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
- Just give it to me!

278
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,555
All right. Okay, okay.

279
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,892
Go back to bed,
and I'll give you the stupid thing.

280
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:32,652
Joseph, look out!

281
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:34,855
Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!

282
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:37,575
Joseph, help me!

283
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:44,609
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.

284
00:30:01,322 --> 00:30:03,427
No! Help me!

285
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:27,271
Help! Help me!

286
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:29,309
Help me!

287
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:41,633
Help me!
Help me! Please!

288
00:30:52,837 --> 00:30:56,153
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They tore James apart.

289
00:30:56,228 --> 00:31:00,057
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.

290
00:31:00,132 --> 00:31:01,757
They were focused on his brother.

291
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:06,945
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.

292
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,342
Can you see?
Can you hear?

293
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:40,030
Come with me.

294
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:27,546
Monsieur Bession?

295
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:32,467
Mr. Bession.

296
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:34,611
You worked on a dig in Derati.

297
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,166
You drew a picture of an idol.

298
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:44,950
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?

299
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:47,668
Mr. Bession.

300
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:51,381
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?

301
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:54,351
I said how do you know my name?

302
00:33:03,384 --> 00:33:06,002
Are you hurt?

303
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,980
No.

304
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,652
I'm free.

305
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:23,982
God is not here today, priest.

306
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:07,368
I hope he finds peace.

307
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,735
I'm Father Gionetti.

308
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,255
I've been waiting for you.

309
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:15,946
How did he know my name?

310
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:18,918
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

311
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,476
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

312
00:34:22,544 --> 00:34:25,227
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

313
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:28,109
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

314
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:31,949
So, "touched."
What does that mean?

315
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:35,975
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

316
00:34:36,046 --> 00:34:38,729
was plagued by possession.

317
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:41,285
Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

318
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:43,267
committing unspeakable acts.

319
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:46,887
Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

320
00:34:46,957 --> 00:34:51,113
Simply horny... and inventive.

321
00:34:51,181 --> 00:34:55,817
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

322
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:59,528
Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

323
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:02,911
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

324
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:05,376
with evil.

325
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:09,280
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

326
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:11,940
And that evil remains in Derati.

327
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:15,044
You must be careful there.

328
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:18,943
Remember, he is the father of lies.

329
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:22,334
He will seek to poison your mind.

330
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,279
You will need this against him.

331
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:30,946
The Roman Rituals.

332
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:34,594
If you need somebody to perform
an exorcism, I'm not your man.

333
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:36,573
I'm not a priest anymore.

334
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:39,168
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.

335
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,336
Only your faith can save you.

336
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,480
Well, then I'm doomed.

337
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:42,966
Joseph?

338
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:04,661
What do you have there?

339
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:10,813
Can I see?

340
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:34,266
You threw it away.

341
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:39,001
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.

342
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:41,915
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn't.

343
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,826
- The clasp must have come loose...
- Liar!

344
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:50,393
Do I repulse you that much?

345
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,392
Maybe if you could cure
my fucking face...

346
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:56,630
I might look as good to you
as that archaeologist.

347
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:04,472
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.

348
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:06,959
What?

349
00:38:07,032 --> 00:38:09,716
He's coming for you.

350
00:38:21,623 --> 00:38:25,452
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.

351
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:27,315
Ohh.

352
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:29,269
Don't worry.

353
00:38:29,335 --> 00:38:31,309
You'll be fine.

354
00:38:48,885 --> 00:38:51,372
Where is everybody?

355
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:54,826
Sebituana's baby is coming,
so the village has gathered in welcome.

356
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,558
Oh.

357
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:26,444
Joseph. Hey.

358
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:38,245
Joseph.

359
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:49,451
You're back.

360
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,293
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.

361
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,220
These lesions...
they're not from the shock, are they?

362
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,076
No.
They're completely asymptomatic.

363
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:02,246
It just doesn't make sense.

364
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,967
- He should have recovered by now.
- So what is it?

365
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,403
In this part of the world...

366
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:09,923
it could be a dozen things...

367
00:40:09,996 --> 00:40:12,614
but his symptoms don't
really match any of them.

368
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:15,105
So all I can do
is just watch and wait.

369
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:21,472
I have to do some work up at the dig.

370
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,646
- Will you be all right?
- Hmm. Yes.

371
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,232
Come sit with me, Lancaster.

372
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:34,664
I promise I won't bite.

373
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:44,737
What is it?

374
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:48,005
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.

375
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:51,171
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.

376
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,803
- How?
- I don't know.

377
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,740
Some accident.

378
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:19,301
I just don't understand everything
that's happening here.

379
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:22,048
It seems like I can't
help anyone anymore.

380
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:26,143
Hey.

381
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:30,398
Easy.

382
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,281
Help me hold him.

383
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:21,286
Emekwi. I'm doing
everything I can for him.
