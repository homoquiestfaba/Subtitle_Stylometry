1
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,649
Hello, there.
I bet you're already saying to yourself:

2
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,018
"Oh, I've already seen this one.

3
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,007
Another holiday special narrated
by some new teen star...

4
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:33,288
...between takes of their oh-so-popular
new sitcom series."

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,994
Well, I'm here to tell you,
"Not this time," because I'm not a star.

6
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,263
Well, not yet at least.

7
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,873
And this ain't about how
so-and-so saved Christmas...

8
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,668
...for all the good boys and girls.

9
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,779
It's more about Santa Claus
settling some unfinished business...

10
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,074
...with a very old acquaintance...

11
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:53,582
...and some kids who
accidentally destroy Christmas.

12
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,483
That's right, nothing under the trees.

13
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,123
A catastrophe caused by a kid... Me.

14
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,520
- that was too smart for his own good.

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,391
A kid who messed up his hometown,
messed with Santa...

16
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:10,695
...messed with Christmas, and the
entire, complete known universe...

17
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,465
...or at least,
it almost worked out that way.

18
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,336
So grab yourself a
super-sized hot chocolate...

19
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,775
...sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride...

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,380
...because this is one
very special Christmas...

21
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,017
...you're never gonna forget.

22
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,200
So, Veronica, looks like another
green Christmas this year.

23
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,131
Sure does, Trevor. Your turn.

24
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,742
So, Veronica, hey.

25
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,176
I asked Santa for a
new chess set this year.

26
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,185
Okay.
Well, what did you ask him for?

27
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,021
Nothing, Trevor.

28
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,455
I don't believe in Santa Claus.

29
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,822
For real life? Come on.

30
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,498
Sorry, Trev. It's the skeptic in me.

31
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,366
I tend not to believe
in things I can't see.

32
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:37,267
Veronica, you don't have to
see him to believe he's real.

33
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,412
Let me get this straight.
You believe in an overweight guy...

34
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,606
...who rides around in a sleigh
pulled by "magic flying reindeer"?

35
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,546
Well, basically, yeah.

36
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,746
Trevor, Trevor, Trevor.
Think about it.

37
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,490
There are two billion
children in the world.

38
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,785
So, what's the problem?

39
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,485
Even if he's only giving
presents to a third of them...

40
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,723
...Santa's sleigh would have to
go 3,000 times the speed of sound.

41
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,922
Carry on.

42
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,865
Assuming each child gets
one medium-sized present...

43
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,301
...that weighs an average
half a kilogram.

44
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,998
The sleigh is carrying
400,000 metric tons...

45
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,143
...or the average weight
of an ocean liner.

46
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,903
Did you read this on the internet?

47
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:19,016
On land, conventional reindeer
can pull no more than 150 kilograms...

48
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,780
...even granting that flying reindeer
could pull 10 times the normal amount.

49
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,756
Well, I don't know how to
break this to you, Trevor...

50
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,289
...but it all sounds rather unlikely.

51
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,361
Interesting theory, Veronica.

52
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,966
Bravo, but Santa doesn't
ride the scientific wave.

53
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,227
He's magical.

54
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,029
Whatever.

55
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,134
By the way, checkmate.

56
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,573
A most dramatic game as usual,
Gabriel.

57
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,906
Yes, Errol.
My heart is still racing.

58
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,857
Trevor, I have one question.

59
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,625
Just curious, what was all that talk about
Santa Claus during the chess match?

60
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,826
Yeah, oh, what up with that, T?

61
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,902
You ruined a perfectly
good tournament.

62
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,573
I was trying to head fake her.

63
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,867
Get her off her game, you know,
distract her.

64
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,304
Distract her?

65
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,571
- Trevor, you lost the game.
- It only looks that way.

66
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,410
Excuse me. Hey, Ronnie!

67
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,019
You dropped something.

68
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,887
Allow me.

69
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,322
You know what your problem is?

70
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,827
You don't believe in magic.

71
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,020
It's in your other hand.

72
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,292
- True. But what if it wasn't?
- Trevor.

73
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,970
Can't we just agree
to disagree sometimes?

74
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,331
Okay, Veronica.

75
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,769
But I know Santa is real.
I know it in my heart.

76
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,671
It's probably just heartburn.

77
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,812
Very funny.

78
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,983
Cuddles, the rainbow
unicorn sparkle wand.

79
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,251
What are you looking at?

80
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,445
Oh, nothing.

81
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,990
You know, I was thinking. What if
I could prove to you Santa is real?

82
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,129
- Prove it? How?
- With physical evidence.

83
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,356
- Physical evidence of Santa Claus?
- Exactly.

84
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:19,368
All I have to do is, well, catch him.

85
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,563
You know, so you can
see him for yourself.

86
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,332
Well, that's great.

87
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,443
Too bad he doesn't exist.

88
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:31,944
<i>I believe in Santa Claus</i>

89
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,211
<i>Because he's true to me</i>

90
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,589
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>That reindeer and a sleigh</i>

91
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,629
<i>Can take a man on such a jolly spree</i>

92
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:53,200
<i>Stop right now</i>
<i>Let me show you how</i>

93
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,843
<i>He can do this all in one night</i>

94
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,809
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>It's impossible</i>

95
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,153
<i>The facts will never prove you right</i>

96
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,391
You know, Veronica,
thanks to the different time zones...

97
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,997
...if Santa travels east to west,
he buys himself approximately 31 hours...

98
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:24,431
...of Christmas Eve to work with,
not merely 12 as in your flawed critique.

99
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,400
Nice try, Trevor...

100
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,167
...but I'm afraid your numbers
are just like your name...

101
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:34,941
...mechanically correct,
but unsophisticated.

102
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:39,550
<i>These are all just silly words</i>

103
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,513
<i>I need to see some proof</i>

104
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,082
<i>Just close your eyes</i>

105
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,257
<i>And you will hear</i>

106
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,231
<i>The reindeer on the roof</i>

107
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:01,334
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>That this Santa Claus</i>

108
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:06,443
<i>Can do it all on Christmas Eve</i>

109
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:12,216
<i>Anything is possible</i>

110
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:17,221
<i>As long as we believe</i>

111
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:26,091
<i>The facts will never prove you right</i>

112
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,293
In fact, why am I even
having this discussion?

113
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,040
Errol, Gabriel,
you believe in Santa, right?

114
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,177
We avoid taking a
stance on such things.

115
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,415
In metaphysics,
one prefers to remain on the fence.

116
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,382
- But you'll help me catch him?
- Oh, baby, yeah.

117
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,145
Okay, guys, we've got work to do.

118
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,880
Our first order of business
is gathering data.

119
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,683
So where do we find the big guy?

120
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,505
Main generator's up.

121
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,206
Main generator's up.

122
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,011
Solar batteries and
borealis tranjector.

123
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,886
Solar batteries and
borealis tranjector.

124
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,618
Closing the doors.

125
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,361
Close hangar doors.

126
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,401
That's 10 seconds faster than last year,
sir.

127
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,973
<i>Stand down from drill.</i>

128
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,576
<i>Reindeer wranglers report to the barn.</i>

129
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,679
Good work, team.
You guys are the best.

130
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,179
Now, how about that coffee?

131
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,785
Your mocha-double-cappuccino-
yummalicious-delicious-yuletide decaf...

132
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,454
...shaken not stirred, sir?

133
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,853
<i>Two-one-three, report to main office.</i>

134
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,653
Soy milk? Who put soy milk in my...?

135
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,990
You know what the doctor says,
my little Santa Wanta.

136
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,893
Yes, dear.

137
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,769
<i>Elf 36, call your mother.</i>

138
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,904
- Hand it over.
- What are you getting at?

139
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,300
Come on.

140
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,566
And the other one.

141
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,710
<i>Beware of rabid reindeer.</i>

142
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,374
I've got my eye on you, Mr. Claus.

143
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,446
Back to work, everyone.
We're on a schedule here.

144
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:34,454
Okay, start loading the presents,
people. Stat.

145
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,589
- Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,299
- Ribbons and bows, come on.
- Ribbons and bows!

147
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,526
Wrapping paper!

148
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,637
More presents!

149
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,520
Merry Christmas.

150
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,656
- Is it 4:00 yet?
- Three more hours, Frank.

151
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,058
Oh, boy.

152
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,240
Merry Christmas.

153
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,275
Merry, merry, merry Christmas.

154
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,143
And precisely what are we doing here,
Trevor?

155
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,482
Veronica doesn't believe in magic.
We'll use science to catch him.

156
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,525
First we'll need some real
evidence from our specimen.

157
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,930
Why don't we just spirit
the gentleman away right now?

158
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,861
First we have to confirm his identity.

159
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,059
You know, make sure he's the
real McCoy. Did you guys bring it?

160
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,761
Check. The X-ray 9,000.

161
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,205
- It's never been tested outside the lab.
- I hope he's got lead in his underwear.

162
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,481
Come on up here, young fella.

163
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,945
Now, what would you like
for Christmas this year?

164
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:12,284
- Well, actually, just a few photos of you.
- Well, of course.

165
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,052
- Jill, take a picture.
- That won't be necessary.

166
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,197
I brought my own photographers.

167
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,397
Hey, look, a rainbow.

168
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,398
DNA, check.

169
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,593
Visual reference...

170
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,171
...check.
- Well...

171
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,040
...he has an enormous solid mass of
polyester padding in the thorax region.

172
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,444
And he's wearing a rudimentary beard
of some unknown fibrous origin.

173
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,050
Prepare yourself, Trevor.

174
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,990
That man in the town
square is not Santa Claus.

175
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,255
Well how do we find the real Santa?

176
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,861
Gentlemen, to the Internet.

177
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,368
Looking for Santa Claus, Kris Kringle.

178
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,696
Saint Nicholas.

179
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,337
- Father Christmas.
- Cinder Claus.

180
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,007
- Papa Noël.
- Père Noël.

181
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,877
- Veronica?
- Veronica?

182
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,069
Who calls him that?

183
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,145
Have you been there all along?

184
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,943
Come on, guys,
you're wasting your time.

185
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:17,088
It's Christmas Eve.
Let's go do something fun.

186
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,925
Okay, okay, for the sake of argument...

187
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,063
...what if I can see that
perhaps Santa maybe exists...

188
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,996
...in some kind of parallel,
alternate universe kind of thing?

189
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,362
You're saying he lives
on another planet?

190
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,667
No, I think she's saying
he has a time machine.

191
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,471
No, no, no. I was just kidding.

192
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,013
Look, I'm just trying to help
you see that you're acting crazy.

193
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,346
All right, Veronica, you're really
starting to rain on our parade.

194
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,820
But you sound ridiculous.

195
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,356
Do you guys even have a plan?

196
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,328
Okay, good question.

197
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,756
Which one of you two
has been keeping notes?

198
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,228
Well, we have a route, a velocity...

199
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,029
...and a fair guesstimate
of what time he'll be overhead.

200
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,197
- With a slight margin of error.
- About the size of Texas.

201
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,070
That's not a plan.

202
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,768
It's not even an idea.

203
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,176
It's just a bunch of words strung
together trying to sound scientific.

204
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,851
Maybe,
but I'm gonna catch Santa Claus...

205
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,953
...and that will be all the
scientific proof you need.

206
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,613
<i>Trevor, quick.</i>
<i>Come up to the observatory right away.</i>

207
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,336
You know it's Christmas Eve, right?

208
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:47,678
- New Year's Eve is still a week away.
- Oh, yes, dear, of course.

209
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,341
We're celebrating because we just
spotted a very rare and unusual comet.

210
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,680
It's called Lefreeze,
just a big ball of ice really.

211
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:01,223
And it drifts close to Earth's
orbit only once every 100 years.

212
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,019
Right around Christmas time.

213
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:07,790
Wow, congratulations, Dr. Taylor.
What are you doing to celebrate?

214
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,299
Well, it is Christmas, you know,
and we're having dinner with grandma...

215
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,835
...which reminds me,
are you coming, Trevor?

216
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,472
Yeah.

217
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,566
But we've kind of got that
holiday book report to do.

218
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,605
- A book report on Christmas Eve?
- Yeah.

219
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,078
It sort of came up at the last minute.

220
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,443
Right, Errol?

221
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,312
Sure, whatever you say, sir.

222
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,852
Okay, Trevor, you can join us later.

223
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,514
There's a casserole in the fridge
in case you kids get hungry.

224
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,157
All right,
we'll make this our control center.

225
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:41,163
- You're incorrigible, you know?
- That's what you like about me.

226
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,337
So that's Lefreeze, huh?

227
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,964
My back.

228
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,369
- How long have I been asleep?
- A hundred years, Mr. Lefreeze, sir.

229
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,372
Thanks for waiting.
Did I miss anything?

230
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,137
Boss, you live in a comet.

231
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,747
What's there to miss?

232
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,712
Okay, then.

233
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,545
What's on our agenda?

234
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,480
Well, we were thinking
of taking over a planet.

235
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,988
- You know, subjugating a solar system.
- Oh, no, no. I'm not in the mood.

236
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:45,027
- Not in the mood. What else you got?
- Well, it's Christmas time, sir.

237
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,130
Christmas time?

238
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,899
You know what that means.

239
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,467
- Time to put on snow tires?
- Time to wear long underwear.

240
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,871
You know, sometimes I can't believe
we came out of the same snow drift.

241
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,514
- It's time to catch Santy Claus.
- Bingo.

242
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,148
And this time,
we're gonna get him, too.

243
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,081
This might sound like a stupid question,
fellas.

244
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,448
Then don't ask it.

245
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,351
What do you got against Santa Claus?

246
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,152
Have I not explained
this to youse before?

247
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,794
Well, l... Maybe I wasn't in the room.

248
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,521
Oh, fantastic. You made him sing.

249
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,637
<i>Santa never paid me no mind</i>

250
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,242
<i>Santa never was jolly and kind</i>

251
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,370
<i>Santa never would give me his time</i>

252
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,779
<i>Now I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

253
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:44,649
<i>Santa never had nothing for me</i>

254
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,821
<i>Santa never could hear my plea</i>

255
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:53,020
<i>And, Santa, I demand your apology</i>

256
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:57,100
<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

257
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,291
One!

258
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,371
I do not like those big, red,
baggy pants, Santa.

259
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,939
- Two!
- What are you always doing hanging...

260
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,872
...around the mall?
- Three!

261
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,445
You know, if I snuck into someone's
house in the middle of the night...

262
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,809
- Four!
...they'd lock me up.

263
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:17,421
- And what's up with the cookies?
- Five, six, seven, eight!

264
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,423
<i>Santa, I've got a beef with you</i>

265
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,563
<i>Santa, I think you know it too</i>

266
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,564
<i>Santa, get ready to be Santa who</i>

267
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,932
<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

268
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,663
- One!
- Oh, Santa.

269
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,535
- Two!
- I'm gonna get you.

270
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,907
- Three!
- Oh, I'm coming for you.

271
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,636
- Four!
- Yes, sirree.

272
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,045
<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

273
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,982
<i>He's got a list</i>
<i>A list of his own</i>

274
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,180
<i>Because I've got a list</i>

275
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,915
<i>He's got a list</i>

276
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:58,620
<i>Oh, I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my</i>

277
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:04,291
<i>We've got to catch him</i>
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

278
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,164
<i>Own</i>

279
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,383
Bring up the reindeer!

280
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,893
Bringing up the reindeer!

281
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,361
Reindeer on deck!

282
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,659
Commence Christmas protocol.

283
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,098
Commencing Christmas protocol.

284
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,967
More presents.
Here's another load!

285
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,574
A dozen more pink ones. Stat!
Bring it up!

286
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,875
Back it up.

287
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,209
Too far. Keep them coming.

288
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,786
Easy does it. Easy, easy, easy.

289
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,390
Oh, right there. Nice one, Charlie.

290
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,863
All done.

291
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,861
That's the last one.
Everyone stand clear.

292
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:15,733
<i>Prepare to deck the halls.</i>
<i>Deck them, dude.</i>

293
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,971
Ready for your inspection, sir.

294
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,113
Toys?

295
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,512
- Check.
- Carriage for the reindeers?

296
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,950
Check. And, don't worry, Santa,
I've got your donuts on the list.

297
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,714
Our little secret.

298
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,058
Speaking of which, where is that list?

299
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,894
May I have a word, Santa, dear?

300
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,361
Anything for you, darling.

301
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,296
Do you remember what year it is?

302
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,696
My, my, my.

303
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,876
Has it been 100 years already?
Where does the time go?

304
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,169
And speaking of which...

305
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,774
...it's time to be going.

306
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,382
Lefreeze nearly caught you last time.
What if he tries again this year?

307
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,385
I know how to deal with him.

308
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,855
Maybe you should stay home this year.

309
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,928
We can send out gift certificates.

310
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,497
And I hear the South Pole's
very nice this time of year.

311
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,864
Hey, I'm Santa Claus.
What could go wrong?

312
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,404
Too obvious.

313
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,575
Too primitive.

314
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,008
Not bad.

315
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,372
It has potential.

316
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,016
- You've become obsessed with this.
- No, I haven't.

317
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:36,813
Oh, maybe we should try lining
the chimney with superglue.

318
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,685
Come on, Trev.
You don't have to do this for me.

319
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,088
Oh, this isn't just for you.
No, no, no.

320
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,892
I'm doing it for the whole world,
for all the Veronicas out there.

321
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,035
I, Trevor Taylor the second...

322
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,637
...will finally answer one
of life's greatest questions...

323
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,604
...solve one of its enduring mysteries.

324
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,745
I will prove for once and
all that Santa is real.

325
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,515
And then I'm gonna
throw a press conference.

326
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,849
Okay, maybe I'm a little bit obsessed.

327
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,717
- You're off the charts, Trevor.
- You guys are pathetic.

328
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,191
- You know she's right.
- We are pathetic.

329
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,892
Point of order, exactly
how do we plan on catching him?

330
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,134
Join me upstairs, gentlemen, and lady.

331
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,036
All will be revealed.

332
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,248
It's perfect.

333
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:43,683
It can't miss. I present to you
the space traction laser beam.

334
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,757
One zap will pull his
sleigh gently down to Earth.

335
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,689
The rest is history.

336
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,022
- Bravo.
- Yes.

337
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,790
As you can see,
I've got the sighting component here.

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,594
Now, if I could just get my hands on a...

339
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,365
How do I put this?

340
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,506
- High-powered laser?
- Well, why didn't you say so?

341
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,732
You can borrow our
parents' industrial model.

342
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,435
Yes, they keep it in the garage
still in the original packaging.

343
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,639
Why do your parents
have an industrial power laser?

344
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,784
It just happened to
be on sale at the time.

345
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,976
Half-price. They couldn't resist.

346
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,520
Well, there you have it then.
We're set to go.

347
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:22,784
- You know, Trevor, I was just thinking...
- Yes?

348
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,019
I really appreciate
what you're doing here...

349
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,858
...but you and I both know
you're not gonna catch him.

350
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,058
And I don't want to be responsible
for shattering your dream.

351
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,830
See, that is exactly why I have to do it,
Veronica.

352
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,907
If this is the only way I
can prove to you he exists...

353
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,204
<i>A blip in the sky</i>
<i>A jolly red guy</i>

354
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,474
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

355
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,085
<i>He's on his way</i>
<i>Got the super cool sleigh</i>

356
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,415
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

357
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,026
<i>Where did he go?</i>

358
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,492
<i>We've got to catch him because</i>

359
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,792
<i>We need some proof</i>
<i>He's up on the roof</i>

360
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,198
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

361
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,846
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

362
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,777
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

363
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,457
<i>We've got to catch him because</i>

364
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,993
<i>We need some proof</i>
<i>He's up on the roof</i>

365
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,631
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

366
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,633
<i>The schedule is tight</i>
<i>There's only one night</i>

367
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,501
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

368
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:47,473
<i>He's fixing to leave</i>
<i>On Christmas Eve</i>

369
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,512
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

370
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,344
<i>You know we've got to be quick</i>
<i>To catch Saint Nick</i>

371
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,545
<i>We've got to catch him because</i>

372
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,214
<i>We need some proof</i>
<i>He's up on the roof</i>

373
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:04,486
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

374
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,530
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

375
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,473
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

376
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,081
<i>We've got to catch him because</i>

377
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,277
<i>We need some proof</i>
<i>He's up on the roof</i>

378
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,457
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

379
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,451
<i>We need some proof</i>
<i>He's up on the roof</i>

380
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,756
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

381
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:49,831
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

382
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,478
Okay, so let's go through this again.

383
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,087
You aim with this.

384
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,450
You shoot with that.

385
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,821
And then, you use this other
thing to reel him back in.

386
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,865
- It's just like fishing, boss.
- Fishing for Santa Claus.

387
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,860
- But what do we use as bait?
- That's the beauty of it, boss.

388
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:24,007
- This thing don't need bait.
- Nice, I get it.

389
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,269
No. Actually, I don't.
Can we go through this again?

390
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,205
You guys was going kind of fast.

391
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,339
Begin Christmas countdown.

392
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:59,104
- Beginning Christmas countdown.
<i>- Begin Christmas countdown.</i>

393
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,974
December 24 time-zone itinerary
adjusted for International Date Line.

394
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,980
Sunset, umbra and moon shadow.

395
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,482
Setting continuum clock.

396
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,623
Synchronize now.

397
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,927
<i>Attention, attention. Clear hangar deck.</i>

398
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,065
Shotgun.

399
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,670
Real funny, kid.
You ride with the reindeer kibble.

400
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,811
Make me proud, Santa.

401
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,918
All right, everybody! To your stations!
Let's go!

402
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,682
<i>Open hangar doors.</i>

403
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,691
- Yogurt.
<i>- Pardon all electronics.</i>

404
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,901
<i>Prepare for borealis effect.</i>

405
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,763
<i>- Five.</i>
- All set back there, Barky?

406
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,372
<i>- Four.</i>
- Not really, sir.

407
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,805
Somebody left an old
present under the seat.

408
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,705
Look's like it's been here forever.

409
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,143
- Let me see that. I remember this one.
<i>- Two.</i>

410
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,408
<i>- One.</i>
- Okay, let's do this.

411
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,518
The Armor Smata 2,000.

412
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,922
The sturdiest containment
unit money can buy.

413
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:08,690
I'm setting it, appropriately enough,
for a 300-pound gorilla.

414
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,033
You're right,
should probably make it 350.

415
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,372
Almost forgot,
the most important ingredient...

416
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,441
...the cookies and milk for the bait.

417
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,011
The guy keeps a tight schedule.

418
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,579
He should be overhead
in approximately 14 seconds.

419
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,040
Team two, do you copy?

420
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,082
Team two, copy.

421
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,823
<i>How are you doing</i>
<i>with that tracking system?</i>

422
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,063
I just got a visual...

423
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,002
...and I have a lock.

424
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,138
There's something we forgot
to tell you about that laser.

425
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,397
Yeah?

426
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,472
It was originally built
for missile defense.

427
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:55,009
It may have a little more
kick than anticipated.

428
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:10,057
There he is. Right on time.

429
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,229
So predictable.

430
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,794
Merry Christmas, Santa Claus.

431
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,572
Get ready, Veronica,
because here comes your proof.

432
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,266
Fire.

433
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,481
We've been hit!

434
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,020
- Santa!
- What?

435
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,384
Where'd he go?

436
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,424
He's getting away!

437
00:32:55,773 --> 00:33:00,039
Mayday, mayday, this is Pole Force 1.
Big Red overboard.

438
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:04,045
Repeat, Big Red overboard.

439
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,264
Good job, trainee.

440
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,958
Put on the brakes, number 1.

441
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:32,538
We've got to land this baby
by the seat of our pantaloons.

442
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,074
- Your coldness, sir.
- What?

443
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,479
It looks like somebody
else shot him first.

444
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,622
- With a laser of industrial strength.
- A laser?

445
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,381
- Now, that's clever.
- Yeah, clever.

446
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,856
I do not believe this.

447
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,529
Who uses lasers these days?

448
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,889
Looks like he's crashing
into some small town.

449
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,590
And that means he's grounded.

450
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,396
- He can't fly away.
- He's off the sleigh.

451
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,472
Perfect. Well, what are we waiting for?

452
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,747
Team two to base.
Santa rooftop contact confirmed.

453
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,321
Oh, my.

454
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,517
- Santa 's on the roof.
- I can't believe it.

455
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,025
It's a raccoon.

456
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,062
I knew karate lessons would
prove to be a sound investment.

457
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,927
Let's get him.

458
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,606
And I had to eat those donuts.

459
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:51,084
Well, would you look at that?
There's cookies in that basement.

460
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,694
On your left.

461
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,154
Got you.

462
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,500
Did you get him?

463
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,702
I got you.

464
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,398
We'll reconnoiter and report
after applying first aid.

465
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,078
Stop moving. Hey.

466
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,940
Errol's got him.

467
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,474
- I've got you now, Santa.
- No, you don't, Gabriel.

468
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,016
It's me, your own brother.

469
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,656
Well, how am I supposed to know that
in the dark with a Santa on your head?

470
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:29,725
This is becoming extremely tiresome.
Please take it off at once.

471
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,789
Don't pull my head off.

472
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,154
Santa.

473
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:39,462
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
He's got to be around here somewhere.

474
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,970
I keep telling you.
It was just a raccoon on the roof.

475
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,575
Oh, Veronica, ye of little faith.

476
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,875
Excuse me.

477
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,584
Help, help, help.

478
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,649
It's stuck.

479
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,413
Hold on.

480
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,248
Errol, stop moving.

481
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,116
I got nothing.

482
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,788
Santa?

483
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,056
Where am I?

484
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,532
My head.

485
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:16,999
- I actually did it? I caught Santa Claus.
- Right. It sure looks that way.

486
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,733
Where am I? What's going on here?

487
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,777
Santa Stopper 3, do you copy?

488
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,816
Santa Stopper 2?

489
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,945
Oh, I gotta go get the guys.

490
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,423
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

491
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,593
Ronnie, whatever you do,
don't let him out.

492
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,092
At least not until after
the press conference.

493
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:43,529
Then we'll show the world that the
magic of Santa Claus really does exist.

494
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,599
Whatever.

495
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,778
I have to admit,
you're the best Santa I've seen yet.

496
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,075
Trevor's clearly gone to a lot of trouble.

497
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,945
Is this real?

498
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,246
Look, pal,
I don't know what he's paying you...

499
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,514
...but it will take more
convincing than this.

500
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,214
You may as well pack up now.

501
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,087
What are you talking about?

502
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,127
You and I both know Trevor
paid you to come here.

503
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,095
- How much?
- Trevor? Trevor Taylor?

504
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,030
Is he responsible for this?

505
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,467
Now I get it.

506
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,039
You can tell him,
"Nice try, but no cigar."

507
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,542
Tell him I do not,
and never will, believe in Santa.

508
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,111
End of story, done.

509
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:36,014
You used to believe in me,
Miss Veronica Jean Campbell.

510
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,818
- So he told you my name, huh?
- Veronica.

511
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,753
Could he have told me about
a certain Christmas present...

512
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,086
...that a certain girl always wanted...

513
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,695
...but was too embarrassed
to tell anyone about?

514
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,593
- What?
- Here it is, Veronica.

515
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,066
A Cuddles, the rainbow-haired, limited
edition magic light-up sparkle wand?

516
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,638
- Merry Christmas.
- How did you...?

517
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,002
But... Oh, my.

518
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,804
You are Santa Claus, aren't you?

519
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,672
You're real!

520
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,748
Santa Claus is real?
I had no idea.

521
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,852
- Be quiet, will you?
- Sorry, Mr. Claus, sir.

522
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,579
Mr. Claus is my father.
Call me Santa.

523
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,382
And now that we've got
that out of the way...

524
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,685
...could you please
get me out of here?

525
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:22,924
- I'm kind of on a tight schedule.
- Anything you say, Santa, sir.

526
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,565
Sorry I didn't believe in you.

527
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,366
- Forget about it. It goes with the job.
- Yes, sir.

528
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,439
You can pull that rope over there.

529
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:37,510
You know, about trapping you like this...

530
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,275
...I just want to say,
I had nothing to do with it.

531
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,850
And he looks just like in the movies.

532
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,010
Ronnie, don't!

533
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:51,289
- You said you wouldn't let him out.
- Yeah, when I thought he was a fake.

534
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,018
Hey.

535
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,061
Where'd he go?

536
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,132
- What did you do with him, Ronnie?
- Me?

537
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,833
- Nothing.
- He must have gone out the window.

538
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,901
Spread out. We got to find him.

539
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:10,570
- You stay here, in case he comes back.
- Oh, no. I'm going with you.

540
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,681
To Woody, the lumberjack.

541
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,358
Thank you Woodrow.

542
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,093
You did what you set out to do, Trev.
Now let him go.

543
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,392
No, no, I still need to call the press.

544
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,831
We need to tell people
the truth once and for all.

545
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,062
- He's not getting away.
- Are you crazy?

546
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,332
Santa's got deliveries to make,
a schedule to keep.

547
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,941
What happened to you?

548
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:45,480
Look, let's just say that maybe,
just maybe, you were right.

549
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,346
- Keep talking.
- What? Do I have to apologize?

550
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,316
Look, can't we just let him go?

551
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,457
Are you trying to help Santa get away?
Again?

552
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,390
Now that he's real,
that changes everything.

553
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,261
I think I heard something
inside the shed.

554
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,024
I'll check it out.

555
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,938
Santa?

556
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,835
Is that you?

557
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,235
Are you in here?

558
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,779
Trevor. What's going on?

559
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,881
Sorry, Ronnie,
but I'm doing this for your own good.

560
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,449
You're gonna interfere
with the rest of the mission.

561
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:25,144
- Open this door, Trevor.
- Soon as my mission is complete.

562
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,823
You have my word as a friend.

563
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,616
No, right now.

564
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:32,626
I can't trust you to follow orders,
and this is bigger than the both of us.

565
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,390
- Oh, I'm gonna get you for this.
- You.

566
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,998
You put me behind schedule.

567
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,727
Santa, I know you're upset.

568
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,872
I didn't mean for it to go down like this.

569
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,233
Get him.

570
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,637
- Look, I'm a busy guy.
- Let him go.

571
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,302
Please, Santa.

572
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,379
All I wanted was to show
everyone that you exist.

573
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,015
You know, for real life.

574
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,419
- It'll only take a few minutes.
- Do you know what you've done?

575
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,418
I have to clear Greenland
before the sun comes up.

576
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:06,085
Mr. Claus, all I'm asking for
is a teeny little press conference.

577
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,323
How about we settle for a photograph?

578
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,940
I don't feel so good.

579
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,510
- What is that?
- Trevor, my boy.

580
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,011
I think you've now become
the least of my problems.

581
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,777
Okay, you kids, stay close to me.
Things are about to get a little chilly.

582
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,786
This would've been a good
year for gift certificates.

583
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,620
Bedford Falls, Welton Mountain...

584
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:42,162
...Avenly, Meisterburger Village?

585
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:46,735
- We're miles off course.
- We're lucky to be alive, trainee.

586
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:50,168
We're off schedule,
stuck in the middle of nowhere...

587
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,898
...and we've lost our captain.

588
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,904
Saddle up, trainee, this has
just turned into a rescue mission.

589
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,292
Earth.

590
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,599
I haven't been here for a while.

591
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,601
It hasn't changed much.

592
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,065
Now, where is he?

593
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,332
He could be anywhere, boss.
Look at this place.

594
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,306
Is it warm down here, or is it just me?

595
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,672
It is a little balmy.

596
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,784
I think it's time to get a
little more comfortable. Boys.

597
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:40,580
Santa, I've had just about
enough of your nonsense.

598
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,919
Now, let me just count the ways.

599
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:48,258
Five, six, seven, eight!

600
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:52,094
<i>Santa, I've got a beef with you</i>

601
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,830
<i>Santa, I think you know it too</i>

602
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,898
<i>And, Santa, get ready to be Santa who</i>

603
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:04,470
<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

604
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,877
- One!
- Big red baggy pants.

605
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,574
- Two!
- Little elves that dance.

606
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,879
- Three!
- That silly, white beard.

607
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,487
- Four!
- Hey, you're pretty weird.

608
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,214
- Five!
- The mall.

609
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,893
- Six!
- You've got a lot of gall.

610
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,721
- Seven!
- And all those snacks.

611
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,726
- Eight!
- You better watch your back.

612
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,526
<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

613
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:28,400
<i>He's got a list</i>
<i>A list of his own</i>

614
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,530
<i>Because I've got a list</i>

615
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,473
<i>He's got a list</i>

616
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:37,807
<i>Oh, I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my</i>

617
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:43,214
<i>We've got to catch him</i>
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

618
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,115
<i>Own</i>

619
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,465
- You know that guy?
- He's an old acquaintance...

620
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,267
...by the name of Lefreeze.
- As in the Lefreeze comet...

621
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,071
...my parents told us about?
- He just froze half our town.

622
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,907
I've never seen so much ice.

623
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,017
- Hence the name.
- What does he have against you?

624
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,686
Besides that list, of course.

625
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,411
Oh, it's a long story...

626
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:21,819
...but he's not looking to exchange
Christmas cards, I can assure you.

627
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,393
- He doesn't look very friendly.
- He's all bark and no bite.

628
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,588
Is there another way
around the square?

629
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,461
Yeah, but, they're in the way.

630
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,600
Looks like my crew will have
to pick me up here, then.

631
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,741
Good thing I've got a
tracking device on the sleigh.

632
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,873
Can we get a picture of that too?

633
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:45,737
Darn.

634
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,383
Help! Let me out!

635
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,884
Somebody? Anybody?

636
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,685
Hey, wait a minute.

637
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:08,570
Magic, huh?
All right, it's worth a try.

638
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,866
Open sesame.

639
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,671
Hey, what do you know?

640
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,281
Maybe there is
something to this magic.

641
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,850
- Santa, up here!
- Catch the rope!

642
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,051
Well, that's my ride.
Thank goodness.

643
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,123
Wait a sec. What about my picture?

644
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,795
I'm very sorry,
but I've got a big night ahead of me.

645
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,725
Adiós and adieu.

646
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,422
Climb the rope. You can make it.

647
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,295
That's it, keep coming.

648
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,632
I had to eat those donuts.

649
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,570
- Keep climbing, Santa.
- Come on, Santa.

650
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,710
- Don't stop.
- Guys:

651
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,115
I can't believe it. There he is.

652
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,857
- Oh, yes, and bull's-eye.
- Yeah!

653
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,218
Nice shot, boss.

654
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:15,795
- Santa, are you okay?
- I like cocoa better than eggnog.

655
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,133
Maybe you should just rest a bit.

656
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:22,039
- Hey, boss, he went down over there.
- Yeah, let's go get him.

657
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,305
Wait a minute.
Something's not right here.

658
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,073
I don't know about those children.

659
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,184
Yeah, boss,
but they're just a bunch of kids.

660
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,354
Yeah, just little kids, like mini-crackers.

661
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,648
They shot him out of
the sky with a laser.

662
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,417
Who knows what they could do to us.

663
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,056
Let me handle this.

664
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,762
Nice job getting Santa Claus, children.

665
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,229
We'd like to commend you.

666
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,598
We've been trying for hundreds of years,
and you...

667
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,105
You pulled it off in one night.
Congratulations.

668
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,368
- Now hand him over.
- Go away!

669
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:58,912
He's ours!
We caught him fair and square.

670
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,550
All right, then, you leave me no choice...

671
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:04,687
...but to bombard you
with these balls of snow.

672
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,085
Did he just hit me with a snowball?

673
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:14,359
You call that a snowball?
Here's a snowball.

674
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,932
- Are you gonna help me or not here?
- Right away, sir.

675
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,433
Yeah, they're just a bunch of kids.

676
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,401
- Take that!
- Yeah, hey, try this on for size.

677
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,006
Hand him over.

678
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,077
I don't think you're getting the hint here.

679
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,777
I came here for Santa. He's mine.

680
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,583
- No, he's mine.
- Mine!

681
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:42,986
- Mine!
- Mine!

682
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,058
- I caught him first.
- I'm bigger than you.

683
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,957
- And uglier.
- Well, there's no need...

684
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,927
...to make this personal. Spread out.

685
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:53,034
See if you can find any more of them.
I got things under control here.

686
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,005
Look at all the snow.

687
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,539
Don't think we're gonna have
another green Christmas this year.

688
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,378
Gotcha!

689
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,711
What on Earth is going on here?

690
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,475
Wouldn't you like to know, sweetheart?

691
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,345
Hey! Hey, get away from me.

692
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,919
Back off, you overgrown snow cones.

693
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:16,718
- Hey, my mother was a snow cone.
- That's right, she was.

694
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,758
Now, you're coming with us.

695
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,694
Help!

696
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,770
- Hey, listen.
- What?

697
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,201
- It's quiet.
- Maybe they've given up.

698
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,240
Not likely. What's he up to?

699
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,104
Drop your snowballs.

700
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:39,339
I think we have something
you might be interested in.

701
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:46,680
- Let her go right now.
- I'll trade you, her for him.

702
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,216
This has gone far enough.
Now, let her go.

703
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,088
- Santa.
- Okay, Freeze.

704
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:56,255
- That's Lefreeze to you.
- Lefreeze, I'm sorry.

705
00:48:56,466 --> 00:49:01,267
No, you're not.
You've never been sorry, but you will be.

706
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,234
Come on.

707
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,203
This isn't really about me.

708
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,071
So how about we settle
this once and for all?

709
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,540
Yeah.

710
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,805
The time has come.

711
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,050
I know what you've wanted
from me all these years.

712
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,392
I stashed it here a while back.

713
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,721
Yeah, yeah, here it is, a little dusty.

714
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:31,100
Good thing I didn't let Barky
clean out the back seat.

715
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:37,568
This is for you, Lefreeze.
Merry Christmas.

716
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,844
Back it up, Red. You think you
can buy him off with a present?

717
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:45,173
You think a knickknack
is enough to make him go away?

718
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,542
You think...

719
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,012
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,051
What kind of self-respecting
ice monster do you think...?

721
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:52,619
Quiet, all of you.

722
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,691
Maybe Lefreeze always wanted
a gift from Santa Claus.

723
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:00,158
Maybe Lefreeze was
hurt he never got one.

724
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:04,793
Boss, are you telling me
that's what this is all about?

725
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,765
One undelivered Christmas present?

726
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,835
You're a villain. Start acting like one.

727
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,735
Yeah, what about that list?

728
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,604
Yeah, the list. And your
unquenchable thirst for revenge?

729
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:20,181
Okay, yeah, that list is all true,
but I mean, what is true anyway?

730
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,051
What I think is true,
scientifically speaking to you...

731
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:29,590
...I mean, may not be exactly true to me,
if you want to get all legal about it.

732
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,525
Look, the honest side of it is, there's
really only one item on that list, okay?

733
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,632
There, I said it.

734
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:42,166
Jeez, I don't know about you guys,
but I'm feeling kind of used.

735
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,703
Yeah, oh, brother.

736
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,899
The whole thing is completely
embarrassing to be honest.

737
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,578
Oh, come on.

738
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,273
- All right, open it.
- Whatever.

739
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,542
Yeah, take it.
I'm sick about the whole thing.

740
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:59,313
- Can't even look at you anymore.
- Do you want this present or not?

741
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,617
Golly, you shouldn't have.
Can I open it now?

742
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,761
Well, it is Christmas.

743
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,696
Yeah!

744
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,504
It's just what I always wanted.

745
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,611
I'm gonna call him Teddy.

746
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,008
Well, this story has
taken an absurd turn.

747
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,842
Oh, this is nothing.

748
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,516
I think I've got a little
something for you three as well.

749
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,258
- You can't buy us.
- Who do you think we are?

750
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,328
- What do you got?
- Let me see here.

751
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,158
I'm sure my reindeer won't miss these.

752
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,434
A real carrot.

753
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:52,397
- You know what? I can finally breathe.
- Gosh, Santa, a carrot.

754
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,100
I don't know what to say here.

755
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,870
Let me see if I can help you.

756
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,277
Thank you, Santa.
We're really sorry about all this.

757
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,180
- So no hard feelings, right?
- Of course not.

758
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,081
'Tis the season to be jolly.

759
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,222
I guess we've caused enough damage.

760
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,221
Maybe we should just get going.

761
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,327
Are you coming, Teddy?
Now, stay close to me.

762
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,521
- It's gonna be cold.
- Goodbye, Santa.

763
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,199
No hard feelings, huh, kids?

764
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,801
If there's, you know, anything we can do,
just let us know.

765
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,802
I think you've done enough.
Now, run along.

766
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,736
Gee, thanks, Santa.

767
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,809
I hope to see you next year.

768
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:37,043
He just needed a little attention, Barky.
Get those reindeer in gear.

769
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,051
Aye-aye, captain.

770
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:43,488
Hey, Santa, I'm sorry for knocking you
out of the sky and everything.

771
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,854
- I guess I got carried away.
- Forget about it.

772
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,896
The main thing is that you helped me
patch things up with Lefreeze.

773
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,035
And I'd rather be shot
down by you than by him.

774
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,295
Well, it was an honor to meet you, sir.

775
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,597
A privilege, indeed.

776
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,105
Sir, are you gonna put us on your
naughty list because of what happened?

777
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,279
We'll just see how you
guys do this coming year.

778
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,211
- And you, Veronica Jean Campbell.
- Yes, sir?

779
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:10,352
Science has its place,
but so does magic.

780
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:11,612
It's just the way it is.

781
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,483
- Thank you, Santa.
- So you don't need me to stick around...

782
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:18,491
...for a press conference, right?
- I think we're satisfied that you're real.

783
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,225
We're all set over here.
Ready when you are, sir.

784
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:25,060
- But how about that picture?
- Okay, just one.

785
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,864
- Say chess.
- Chess!

786
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,438
And now, we'd best be on our way.

787
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:35,008
We'll have to hurry if we're gonna
get everything delivered in time.

788
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,109
Oh, Santa, is there
anything we can do to help?

789
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,978
Well, actually, there is.
May I borrow your wand?

790
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:45,586
- Of course.
- This thing just might save me tonight.

791
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:46,813
Go, Santa, go.

792
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:50,550
Oh, by the way, I think Trevor likes you,
but what do I know?

793
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,886
I'm just Santa Claus.

794
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,029
This ought to speed things up.

795
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,798
Wow, that wand really
turns up the speed.

796
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,798
All right, gang, let's shake a hoof.

797
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,301
Thanks for everything, Santa.

798
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:07,772
Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!

799
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,301
We had better return
that laser tout de suite.

800
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,567
What's the rush?

801
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,210
We're already grounded for life.

802
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,573
I thought you really wanted that wand.

803
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,944
Yeah, I did,
but Christmas is about giving.

804
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,846
Yeah.

805
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,715
- Sorry I locked you up.
- It's okay.

806
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,220
It all worked out in the end.

807
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:05,588
So, Miss Logical Science Brain, are you
ready to admit that I was right all along?

808
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,592
I thought I did.

809
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,355
Let me hear it just one more time.

810
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:12,057
You still have to prove to me
this all really happened.

811
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:16,034
This could all be a dream,
in which case, it's been a good one.

812
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,207
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Just did.

813
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,638
Wait up!

814
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,507
Trevor.

815
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,777
Wake up, Mr. Sleepyhead.
It's Christmas morning.

816
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,751
We were expecting to see you
at Grandma's last night.

817
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,892
- What happened?
- Mom, Dad, you'll never believe it.

818
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,856
That comet you spotted, Lefreeze...

819
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,498
...there's this ice monster who lives on it,
see, and he hates Santa Claus.

820
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,690
Least he used to.
He came here to get him...

821
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,096
Sounds like one nifty dream, son.

822
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:51,399
I know what it sounds like,
but it actually happened.

823
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,938
Look, I'll prove it.

824
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,706
Oh, no, my camera. What happened?

825
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,681
Oh, the camera must've broke when
we were having that snowball fight.

826
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,013
Maybe it was just a dream.

827
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:09,749
Well, whatever it was, if you want proof
Santa exists, just look under the tree.

828
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:15,027
From Santa, son.

829
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,596
Oh, cool. A chess set, yeah.

830
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,636
Oh, it's just what I asked him for.

831
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,605
Well, not exactly what I asked him for.

832
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,370
This is way better.

833
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:44,058
<i>Santa has returned.</i>
<i>Santa has returned.</i>

834
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,125
<i>Santa, come on down.</i>

835
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,223
Honey, I'm home.

836
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,293
How was work, big boy?

837
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,597
- Oh, boy.
- So did you run into Lefreeze?

838
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,002
More like he ran into me.

839
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,542
Oh, you just need a good night's sleep,
dear.

840
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,042
I think I need x-rays.

841
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,475
It went that well, huh?

842
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:10,517
Let's just say last night gets an
entire chapter in my autobiography.

843
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,178
So where can a guy find
a sandwich around here?

844
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,760
No, thanks.

845
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,401
You're a good Santa.

846
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,672
So there you have it. Crazy, huh?

847
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,613
Told you this holiday special
would be a little different.

848
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:46,550
Sure, me and my friends
sang a couple songs...

849
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,382
...hung out with Santa Claus...

850
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:53,221
...saved Christmas
from a crazy giant ice monster.

851
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,931
That's all part of the genre.

852
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,362
No, the thing you've got
to give us credit for...

853
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:02,902
...is the simple fact that we shot
Santa out of the sky with a laser.

854
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,734
Correct me if I'm wrong...

855
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:09,002
...but I don't think anyone's ever
done that in a holiday special before.

856
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,474
Ask me why I did it.

857
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,375
Go on, ask.

858
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:15,915
No, it wasn't to make Veronica kiss me.

859
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,143
<i>Hey.</i>

860
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,981
Although that wasn't so bad.

861
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,680
This was about doing what
every kid has wanted to do...

862
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,325
...since the beginning of time.

863
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:28,896
I proved once and for all that Santa
is real, and I did it with science.

864
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,793
<i>Visual reference.</i>

865
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,336
I'm sure there are skeptics out there
who will say it was all just a dream.

866
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,702
I have only one thing to say to you,
skeptics:

867
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,902
Merry Christmas!

868
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,673
I mean, what else can
you say to a skeptic?

869
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,716
The bottom line is that if you
don't believe I caught Santa...

870
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,319
...my guess is you didn't buy
into this part either.

871
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:53,989
Do you want this present or not?

872
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,196
Yeah!

873
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:07,059
And if that's not your cup of tea,
then what can I say?

874
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,329
To each his own. It's the holidays.

875
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:12,440
Let's all be nice to one another, okay?

876
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:41,890
Okay, okay.

877
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:48,428
So I'm gonna just sort of look at his lines
so I can get a better feel to mine.

878
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,425
I'm sorry to hit that mic,
but that's the way it is.

879
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:58,639
So we're seeing the bags
and things are struggling...

880
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:01,810
...and I presume the chainsaw
comes out through the bag.

881
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:03,808
Right? Okay.

882
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,176
Okay, rolling?

883
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,049
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

884
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,382
That's the way it goes, right?
Okay, right. Wait a minute.

885
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,558
I was hiding in my bag
and got the chainsaw.

886
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:21,253
Right, I'm breaking out of the bag
with the chainsaw.

887
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,455
Okay. Right.

888
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:26,032
I'm coming on like
the <i>Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

889
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,497
Is that correct?

890
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:28,795
Okay.

891
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,064
Is that free? Is that available?

892
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,003
Okay, okay, right.

893
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:36,337
Yes, yeah, yeah. Right, got it.

894
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,013
Okay, good.

895
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,073
Okay.

896
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:43,919
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of hol...</i>

897
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,554
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

898
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,291
<i>Deck the halls with boughs...</i>

899
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,556
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

900
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,231
<i>Deck the halls with bou...</i>

901
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,993
<i>Deck the malls...</i>

902
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:05,003
<i>Teck the balls with...</i>
<i>With bolly holly</i>

903
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,669
<i>Deck the halls...</i>

904
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,244
I got it.

905
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,881
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

906
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,043
<i>Deck the boughs with halls...</i>

907
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,846
With what?

908
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,718
Boughs. Deck the halls with boughs of...

909
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:23,949
Of folly.

910
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,354
<i>Deck the boughs of...</i>

911
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:28,997
<i>With halls of...</i>
<i>With boughs of holly</i>

912
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:32,156
<i>Deck the boughs with hall...</i>
<i>With...</i>

913
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,765
<i>Deck the boughs with...</i>

914
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,937
Deck the halls with boughs of holly.

915
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,441
Right, okay. Yeah.

916
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,840
Yeah.

917
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,208
I think balls...

918
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,906
Halls of...

919
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,710
Boughs of...

920
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,014
Halls with boughs of holly,
I think is funnier.

921
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:59,517
And... which we can use.

922
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,562
Let me do some more... like I'm chasing.

923
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,600
Are you rolling?

924
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,278
As I'm chasing?

925
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:23,008
Should we...? You want the other one?

926
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,187
<i>Deck</i>
<i>Deck</i>

927
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:26,616
<i>Deck</i>

928
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:30,485
<i>The halls with boughs of holly</i>

929
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:38,894
Okay, you happy?

930
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,365
Well, that doesn't work now, does it?

931
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,771
Let me do... again.

932
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,339
About for 3:37.

933
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,443
Yeah, yeah.

934
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,579
I'm moving on?

935
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,248
Okay.

936
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,380
In that case, let's move on.

937
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:57,916
Yes?

938
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,448
Is somebody coming with my coffee?

939
01:06:01,449 --> 01:06:02,449
