00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:07,513
<i> Hey! Hey! </ I>
- Did you talking to me?

2
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:11,116
<i> Yes, I was talking to you, freak. </ i>
- You want some of this? Come on, motherfucker ...

3
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:15,923
In America, more than 60% of prisoners
from ethnic minority ...

4
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:23,629
... Three quarters of all people for drugs cases
in prison are people of color.

00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:08,986
<i> I am a sinner, a good life
trying to drive. </ i>

00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:16,480
THE REVENGE OF CAIN

00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:21,153
<i> I hear drums in my head. </ i>

8
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,281
<i> I live in a jungle
horn and drums. </ i>

00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,892
<i> The drums speak with me. </ i>

10
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,927
<i> The drums come, baby. </ i>

11
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:38,079
<i> Nothing can be done. </ i>

12
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:50,055
My son Ricky sells <i>
drugs to survive. </ i>

13
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:57,318
<i> He is a threat to society.
Not see his own mistakes. </ I>

00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,901
<i> James said in the Bible: </ i>

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,139
<i> "We know we have passed

00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:08,765

00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:13,373
<i> Who does not love staying at the death. "</ i>

00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:23,204
<i> Death, after this torture ...</ i>

20
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:59,740
It must be nice
to the bathroom just for you to have.

21
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:07,511
I said "it should be fine ..."
- I heard you. Why are you talking to me, asshole?

22
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:12,143
Sorry, I just tried to enter into a conversation,
I'm just here.

23
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:15,489
You say something like what you asked, understand?

24
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,085
So you know the bastard?

25
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:34,010
Yes, Red. I got it checked.
He has been detained along with my cousin.

26
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:36,018
Let your cousin strain.
How do you know him?

27
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:41,327
I know him from the neighborhood, Red.

28
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:45,401
Sleepy ...?
- Yes.

29
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:49,281
Try this deal not only by pressing
for you will be shortened.

30
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,627
No, man.
He can be trusted, Red, Red.

31
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:56,711
I tell you: it is reliable.

32
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,676
Sleepy, how are you?
-T. Bone. Look, matured.

33
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:04,852
You look good.
- You look good too. What is it?

34
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:09,069
T-bone, this is my true friend
I was talking about, Redfoot.

35
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,057
What is it?

36
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,363
What's wrong with that husband of yours?

37
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:16,439
There is nothing wrong with me, asshole
and ask me again.

38
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,887
This is negative, this is not good.
- Shut up and let me see the money.

39
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:25,723
Yes, let the money.

40
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:36,315
What did I do, Red?
It's all good.

41
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,347
Perfect.
- Perfect.

42
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:50,115
Next time, less tense.
Until then, Sleepy.

43
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,582
I'll see you again, T.

44
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,377
What did I do?
What did I tell you, Red?

45
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,137
Okay, okay.
- So I want to hear.

46
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,891
Police! Stand.
- Try not to move.

47
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,190
Do not do it, Sleepy.
Sit down.

48
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,673
Prisoner!

49
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:08,449
I hope you like it here.

50
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,335
Over there.

51
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:29,987
I do not know what you've done outside,
but you're in my house.

52
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:36,513
Your house? By the end of the week
I'm here to say.

53
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,634
I said you should keep your mouth.

54
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,259
Hey, Cain.

55
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,719
Derek said I should give you this.

56
00:06:55,754 --> 00:07:06,285
Redfoot.

57
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:38,727
The peace is over.
I've already covered.

58
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,296
I'm going to Redfoot.

59
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:07,870
I want to make sure that
what happened is past.

60
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:12,237
You know, that shit was just anything for.

61
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:18,043
Get out, Redfoot.

62
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,470
I said get out.

63
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,810
I don
bag how to solve ...

64
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,545
So, think about it, and let me know.

65
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:39,987
I've broken your leg so you do not
more drugs in my club can bring ...

66
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,584
so my case in the spotlight.

67
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:58,067
Tell the men to go home.

68
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:00,806
You have his legs broken?

69
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,040
More or less.

70
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:06,189
That was one of Redfoot's men.

71
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:09,655
To the club?
- Yes.

72
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,345
I gotta tell you something here, Red.

73
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,375
I just want you to bring that mess in my club.
You put my case in the spotlight.

74
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:30,859
Your club is in my part of town.

75
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,619
And your part of town
ends at my front door.

76
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:40,785
We need a kind of agreement.
- We have an agreement.

77
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:42,683
You know, your husband ...?
- Yes.

78
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:47,229
He's in the alley, he can see all
give details. Okay? Be careful, mate.

79
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,663
He's inside.

80
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:15,238
Bring your other girls too.

81
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:21,685
Call me when you're at the door.
Shit! I'll call you back.

82
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,347
Breathing, baby.

83
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,345
Stay there. Stay there!
- Dad!

84
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:15,583
<i> hold him back. </ i>
- Dad!

85
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:33,147
Welcome to the prison.

86
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:36,471
I am the director of this facility.

87
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:41,375
My friend Joe and I want to make sure
this is the last place where you will end up.

88
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:48,251
You are here because of robberies,
abuse, gang activity ...

89
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:52,221
Here, you are slaves of the system.
Your choice.

90
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:56,040
You can be free or you may be slaves.

91
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:59,633
This house, these walls
and the prison ...

92
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:04,669
give you a name, your slave name
and number.

93
00:12:05,062 --> 00:12:10,549
The director here, is your boss. He is the one that
tells you when you eat, sleep and shit.

94
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:13,965
I am the bastard, Fredrick Douglas ...

95
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,547
kick you to the underground,
to the freedom outside these walls ...

96
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:22,473
to projects,
as "One Unity" and "Pipeline".

97
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:28,393
Today make a choice.
Live free or die within these walls.

98
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:30,701
Life is choices ...

99
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,566
... Choose the right one.

100
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:43,138
He walks and talks ...
"You know."

101
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:47,878
What's up, Sleepy?
- Hey, Red.

102
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,623
So you're finally here too.
- Man, they had me in jail forever.

103
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:52,943
Was it so?

104
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:58,525
For as I've heard that you tried
transferred to be anywhere but here ...

105
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:00,838
... With me.

106
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:05,878
Every Thurs not dead, Ed. Why should I
not want to be my size?

107
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,561
I do not know
perhaps because I am sitting here because of you.

108
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,315
But it's just the way, right?

109
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:17,945
Red, you know I will compensate you sure, man.
- You're going to compensate me? How?

110
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,927
This is my third time, Sleepy.
- What?

111
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,814
You know I've got 203 years?

112
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:27,746
As if I live long.
The judge thought sure I was a tree, huh?

113
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:31,577
How long did you have?

114
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,979
23 months.

115
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,985
Why?!
- Red, I was not the one who tackled the money.

116
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:47,800
Sleepy?
- Yes.

117
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,725
If you are true, and I need out
these walls have done something ...

118
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,833
then you had better
make it happen.

119
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:58,653
Whatever you want, Red.

120
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,929
Sleepy?
- Yes.

121
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,341
I love you.
- I love you. We have the same ...

122
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:07,319
I know.
Okay.

123
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,409
I love you.
Red, do not go along ...

124
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,008
Red ...

125
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:46,244
Troy say that I need his help.

126
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:49,645
I'm going to Redfoot ass.

127
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:53,183
One against one.

128
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:57,133
Troy say that I did for this
A owe.

129
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:02,914
Tell Derek that I need cash.

130
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:08,411
Tell him that
for me is worthwhile.

131
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:10,501
And that's me guilty.

132
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,601
I will collect.

133
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:59,454
Many of my soldiers are in here.

134
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:02,541
It's like a family reunion.

135
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:04,578
Cain!

136
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:22,373
There's nothing you can do
I fear for hunting.

137
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:27,561
And I am afraid.

138
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:36,750
<i> I would have to give up four months
but given the current circumstances, two. </ i>

139
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:41,227
You lose all privileges: music,
recreation, nothing. You may not leave the cell.

140
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,398
Cain, the time you have left

141
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:47,067
you forced me to one third of your
remaining away life.

142
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:51,551
If weather does something,
I hope you think about it.

143
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:32,767
Hey, that girl there?
- She has just been on.

144
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:13,457
Hey, dude.
- How are you, boy?

145
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,549
Respect.

146
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,697
It's about Ricky.
Do you think I should talk to him?

147
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:23,439
I was thinking, he has everything
From East to 3rd Street.

148
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,535
And you have everything else.
Why do not you come together?

149
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:30,770
What?

150
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:33,913
So you're saying that the negro and I
to do business together?

151
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:36,693
Only, you lead the
two main areas.

152
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:41,381
And together you can take the
whole city to take over. Do you understand me?

153
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,773
Listen, I want that best control.

154
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:47,797
Hi, Mike?
- How are you?

155
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:50,340
You have everything arranged for his birthday our homie?

156
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,565
You know who I am. I have more women
he knows not what he should do.

157
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,626
Whose birthday?
- My size, Robert.

158
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:59,669
Oh, yes,
You all go back to childhood.

159
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,689
Make sure you but you're there.
- Definitely.

160
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:15,362
Where is Ricky?

161
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:18,389
Where is Ricky?
- In the back room.

162
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,367
Homie ...

163
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,695
What is it?
- You need to come and watch.

164
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:29,148
Get out.

165
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:35,191
I told the homie said,
JD that he did not need balls.

166
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,481
Here is my answer

167
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:40,045
That negro is a barbarian, homie.

168
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,365
It is time that he was on "vacation" is involved.

169
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,146
What do you have today, big man?

170
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,707
Cain, you okay there?

171
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:28,974
Willie?

172
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:33,993
Yes?
- Is anybody here with me?

173
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:40,987
I see none.

174
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:51,035
You know, you've always tried
me to read the Bible.

175
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:57,155
Yes.
- Today is the day.

176
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,227
It's a great day for you, Cain

177
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:18,537
Still play sax
in the recording room?

178
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:21,183
No ...

179
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:23,965
The director forbade.

180
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,106
He said he has no manpower had.

181
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:29,269
For additional activities.

182
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,212
I'll never leave here.

183
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:36,628
I have accepted.

184
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:42,019
It is very difficult without my music.

185
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:48,133
When I play it's like I'm not.
- Yes.

186
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:51,675
Damn, I miss that.

187
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:56,825
I gotta go.
See you next week.

188
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:15,072
I heard that you provide for Cain.

189
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:19,847
Yes.
- Now is your big chance to impress him.

190
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:33,295
You have a long time
been held in isolation, Cain.

191
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:39,742
Every time I let you out,
you get something stupid.

192
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:44,518
I know you usually defend yourself
as you are the 'big boss' are.

193
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:48,774
There are plenty of people who think
that if you down ...

194
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:52,573
that they be famous or infamous, or something.

195
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:57,131
Why you always keep going to the hole,
year after year.

196
00:24:57,749 --> 00:24:59,734
You know, we have
those children who come here.

197
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:03,510
Half of them want to know if this
Cain trapped.

198
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:07,214
They see you as a movie star.

199
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,450
You and I know that your life
is not so glamorous.

200
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:17,145
If I were to tell you a
chance to make ...

201
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:20,522
that this does not happen again with these guys from
come close? What if you could help?

202
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:25,143
What if you can pick up life
you've wasted ...

203
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:28,426
and used that to save them?

204
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:33,758
What if I tell you:
you have a chance to save your son.

205
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,436
You hesitate?

206
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,725
What's in it for me?

207
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:44,731
What do you mean?
- If I use these little boxes pus, what good is this?

208
00:25:45,404 --> 00:25:47,828
The ability to help
is already a reward in itself.

209
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:53,582
Okay, what do you want?

210
00:25:55,113 --> 00:25:58,946
I want you back Willie gives his saxophone
and to let him play.

211
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:03,025
You want me to give Willie his saxophone back
and to let him play?

212
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:07,461
I can not do.

213
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:11,670
This is a security risk. We do not
enough staff to allow such a thing.

214
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,444
Let him play in the hole section.
There is no safety,

215
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:16,933
because we are locked 23 hours a day.

216
00:26:18,046 --> 00:26:19,928
That is outrageous.

217
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,040
Well, take it or not.

218
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:27,818
Note to director ...
It's for the children.

219
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:34,342
Good. But if there is a blunder ...

220
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:36,611
then it's over.

221
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:38,887
Cool.

222
00:26:47,664 --> 00:26:51,792
<i> JD Parker, drug dealer,
armed assassin ...</ i>

223
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,123
<i> ... and like all of us fed
by power and greed. </ i>

224
00:26:56,298 --> 00:27:00,794
<i> But the difference with him is that nobody
more safe when he is on the street. </ i>

225
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,506
What is it?

226
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:26,396
Let's go drink something first with the homies,
and we go to one of your student bars.

227
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:30,946
Okay, JD, serious, man.
Come with me to Berkeley.

228
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:35,712
I have that very flat.
Remember that you have paid my tuition fees?

229
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:40,777
As I said, do not say it to the boys.
I do not want everyone to stop his hand.

230
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:43,222
You know, one of us must fit the neighborhood.

231
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:46,743
Come with me, the homies are waiting for us.

232
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:53,254
What's up, guys?

233
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:12,248
Is that one of the homies?

234
00:28:21,007 --> 00:28:25,621
Damn no! Come on!
- Happy birthday!

235
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:37,088
I build a party with my homies

236
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,710
Is that so? Now?

237
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,693
Okay, thanks.
We take a look.

238
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,936
My mate said they have a party at their club.
- Yes?

239
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:54,563
That bastard thinks he has done Mike,
can get away.

240
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,451
Screw this with him and his homies.

241
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,372
<i> 112, what is your emergency? </ i>

242
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:05,032
Only JD.

243
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:09,358
I do not want the whole gang killing
I want nothing to do.

244
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,325
Come on, why do you feel
really worried about the idiots?

245
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,162
You heard what I said.

246
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,170
Yes, yes.

247
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:36,141
I've told you so, just JD.
- I told you, Mike!

248
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:42,690
Drop your weapon.

249
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:48,000
Drop your weapon.
- Drop your weapon!

250
00:29:52,772 --> 00:29:55,413
Your hands and dare not move around.

251
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:16,232
I will direct the point.

252
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,456
Your son Ricky has just been tried.

253
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:30,064
Accessory to murder.
Seven and half years.

254
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:35,709
Sorry, Cain.

255
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:42,971
I'm sorry that this is happening right now, but ...
- No, I have my son talk.

256
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,450
We will guide you to the courtyard
there you can talk to him.

257
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:50,554
But you have to behave.

258
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,619
How you doing, son?

259
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:17,051
Do not call me son.
What is it?

260
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,639
This all works not with me. What is it?
- Look ...

261
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,661
We are on my site,
We do it by my rules.

262
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:31,627
Fuck me your rules.
- You're a gangster, huh? What are you doing here?

263
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:36,284
Listen, do you get the clothes.
Fuck rules.

264
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:40,873
Who wants to talk, homie.
- Like father like son.

265
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:44,588
Is that your explanation?
- I do not have time for that nonsense, man.

266
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:47,444
No.
All you have here is time.

267
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,716
What do you want from me, partner?

268
00:31:57,436 --> 00:32:00,021
Life is choices.

269
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,106
I hope you choose to forgive me.

270
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:32,542
The easy way or
hard, I do not bag.

271
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:36,199
Go fuck yourself with.

272
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:47,757
<i> not do it, Motherfuckers! </ i>

273
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,948
<i> Don'ts Jesus </ i>

274
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:56,532
I have already completed this project sucks.
See all those assholes here?

275
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:59,370
Let them get the discount,
understand what I mean?

276
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:19,258
You got gum?

277
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:23,567
My name is Cain.

278
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,331
Yes, I know, the Seas Tones ...

279
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:29,715
You there, why do you talk so loud?
I'm here, just talking asshole.

280
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,312
Coming from the Seas Tones.
Before?

281
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:35,511
I always heard the stories
of how crazy you are not there.

282
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:39,768
From my Uncle. You remember him
perhaps. His name was Big Al.

283
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:44,450
Yes, I remember Big Al ...

284
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:48,833
A stupid idiot.
- That's heavy balls, man. He's dead.

285
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,332
Yes, I know.

286
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:55,620
He was slain during a robbery
at a liquor store next to the police station.

287
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,248
As I said, an idiot.

288
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,983
Apparently you're just as stupid.

289
00:34:04,984 --> 00:34:09,954
The 'Unity One' and 'Pipeline'
are interested in you.

290
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,570
I ...
Sit still, you bastard!

291
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:16,488
I do not bag for you.

292
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:20,156
I am here to tell you
what is happening to you ...

293
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:24,421
if you end up in a cell,
with a nigger like me.

294
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:31,213
Returning to the dentist?
- Yes.

295
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:33,032
Say Aaa ...

296
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:37,391
Open your mouth further open.

297
00:34:41,055 --> 00:34:43,236
Keep in mind that position.

298
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:46,057
And you, nigger, put your hat off.

299
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,218
Oh, yes ...

300
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:51,525
Put your hair down.

301
00:34:53,363 --> 00:34:55,228
Hang it forward.

302
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:59,607
You have that beautiful hair ...

303
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,696
Oh, yeah, that's really beautiful.

304
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:10,330
Are you part Indian?
- Yes.

305
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:51,840
What? you have a problem with something, nigga.

306
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:54,482
I have a crush on you.
We go to your ass, rookie.

307
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:56,628
I bow but no one, nigga.
What ...?

308
00:35:57,812 --> 00:36:01,227
That's enough.
Stop it. You go back into the cell.

309
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:03,669
Go back in line.
- Your days are numbered.

310
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,354
Keep moving. Now!
Or I turn this thing around your head!

311
00:36:27,078 --> 00:36:30,956
Do not be afraid, Mama's boy.

312
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:33,018
Let alone the black.

313
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:40,180
Yes, I remember your first day here.
You were just like that little fucking bag.

314
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,852
Tall, handsome, black, nice and fresh.

315
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,155
I wanted you to take your ass,
but did not do it.

316
00:36:50,163 --> 00:36:52,437
Now you must reciprocate.

317
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,412
What are you doing?

318
00:36:57,034 --> 00:37:00,566
Back to work.
And hell out of here you two.

319
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,569
Thanks, Cain.

320
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:15,211
Do not thank me, nigga.
You only care for personal protection.

321
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:18,724
I just want to serve my time,
and get out of here

322
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:21,549
I have no interest to me
with someone in order.

323
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:25,411
It does not work, boy.

324
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,644
Like when I said Thank you, Caine.

325
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:42,726
Listen, I want you to clean up.
I'll be back.

326
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,186
All this stuff?
- Everything.

327
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:11,389
What is going on here?
You back, back inside. Hurry.

328
00:38:12,406 --> 00:38:15,484
Clear the mess. Forward.

329
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,399
Back to work.

330
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,792
<i> It looks stupid
You understand me? </ i>

331
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,583
<i> Listen nigga, that's why we're here. </ i>

332
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:34,672
Can you help me with?
It is about survival, Homie.

333
00:38:34,673 --> 00:38:36,508
On the side, nigga.

334
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:43,914
I need two of you together uilskuikens spades.

335
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,438
I can not let you do, brother.
Let's keep the peace.

336
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:54,037
If someone goes to my son
to balls, there will be no peace.

337
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:57,156
You're the boss
because I am not.

338
00:38:58,132 --> 00:39:00,370
But if I'm going to do it again ...

339
00:39:01,669 --> 00:39:06,508
I swear to God, it's bad ending
for those who they involve.

340
00:39:07,465 --> 00:39:09,133
Do you understand me?

341
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:22,910
I heard what you
have done for me, homie.

342
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:24,704
Listen, man.

343
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,125
You do not save me, nigga,
I'll take care of myself, okay?

344
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:33,483
You're my son. I make sure that you
nothing happens whether you like it or not.

345
00:39:33,484 --> 00:39:35,085
What, nigga?

346
00:39:35,692 --> 00:39:39,334
You're the reason my mother died.
What are you talking about?

347
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:46,405
Come on, talk.
Why a life anyway?

348
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:50,626
A kind of fake Bonnie and Clyde.

349
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:55,593
A novelty, nigga.
They died together.

350
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:59,210
And you still alive and remains dead.

351
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:01,188
And you have slain her.

352
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:04,820
I thought so

353
00:40:05,557 --> 00:40:07,263
You know me, dick.

354
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:10,801
I have nothing to say, nigga.

355
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:14,571
As for me,
My mother and father are dead.

356
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:39,028
Prisoners, stop that nonsense!
- We are good friends.

357
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,150
I told them to stop.
- Whatever you want, boss.

358
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,603
I must speak Cain.
- Where are you going, slut?

359
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:53,499
I must speak Cain.

360
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,128
I want to thank you
for me trying to do.

361
00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:00,909
Keep going, man.

362
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:40,253
How many times have I told you
you should do as I tell you?

363
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:43,804
Now I see that we have naughty sissy.

364
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:16,115
I've had visitors last night.
- Last night? From whom?

365
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,455
William ... Big Phil.

366
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:26,468
Southside? You have slain them years ago.
They're all dead.

367
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:29,303
I know.

368
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,771
But his still came by.

369
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,482
I've heard you again, Willie.

370
00:42:58,002 --> 00:42:59,023
Cain ...

371
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,998
... I am grateful.
You have brought me back into music.

372
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:07,390
Another song request?
- Surprise me.

373
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:10,982
Sure, Cain.

374
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:14,006
Sure, man.

375
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,347
I know why you're here.

376
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,264
And I know who you are.

377
00:43:28,616 --> 00:43:30,625
You are my sin.

378
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:34,121
A family that is complete.

379
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,600
My sin ....

380
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:45,381
... Has finally caught up with me.

381
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:47,195
Mr. Parker, on behalf of the state are
I am here to represent you.

382
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:56,671
I think you have to admit guilt.

383
00:45:02,095 --> 00:45:05,095
I'm sorry, Mr.. Parker, I can not understand.
- Thurs here!

384
00:45:05,096 --> 00:45:08,017
Thurs here!

385
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:43,358
Cain!

386
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,628
I have right now need help!

387
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,181
You have to take.

388
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:15,204
What?

389
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:18,944
You do not know yet?
- What do not I?

390
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:25,207
How long do you have?
- I've got 127 years to go.

391
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:29,408
I have good news and bad news.

392
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:32,908
The good news is
that your punishment is significantly reduced.

393
00:46:33,684 --> 00:46:35,987
The bad news is that you
a brain tumor.

394
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:38,746
What?

395
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:43,180
It's just one convicted.
He gets what he deserves.

396
00:46:52,124 --> 00:46:57,120
How do you feel, Mr. Skinner.
- How do you think I feel?

397
00:46:57,404 --> 00:46:59,987
I'm Dr. Zeltzer, your neurosurgeon.

398
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,548
What one day.

399
00:47:04,644 --> 00:47:08,180
I have successfully
biopsy samples taken.

400
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,916
But your tumor was
large to remove it.

401
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:16,738
He was as big as a tangerine.

402
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:20,678
What are you talking about?
Tell me honestly.

403
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,195
I am sorry to have to say, Mr. Skinner.
The prospects are not good.

404
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:30,308
You have about six months to live.

405
00:47:33,736 --> 00:47:35,862
I am really sorry.

406
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:53,084
All favors are, Chain.

407
00:47:54,234 --> 00:47:56,466
I still need one.

408
00:47:58,753 --> 00:48:01,489
I need to talk with my son.

409
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,904
Take it out.

410
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:25,122
Damn, man. You have to really start
to take your pills.

411
00:48:27,098 --> 00:48:29,450
I take no pills.

412
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:35,277
No, man.
Because the pills I feel like a plant.

413
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:44,035
I'd rather feel the pain.
Pain lets me feel alive.

414
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:47,323
I'd rather hurt.

415
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:50,028
Good.

416
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,567
What is this?

417
00:49:08,463 --> 00:49:11,970
I gotta talk to you, Ricky.
- I do not talk to you, nigga.

418
00:49:11,971 --> 00:49:16,399
Hey! Who do you think who you talk to?
- That's between me and my father.

419
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:19,297
If you keep your head,
you learn things a bit.

420
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:22,116
Of this nigga here?
- Are you smarter?

421
00:49:22,475 --> 00:49:24,774
Certainly not more stupid than this clown.

422
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:29,807
Yes, you're so smart, you've stumbled here.
- He's still here too.

423
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:32,694
Yes, and he was also an asshole.

424
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:35,534
But now he has at least
experience on his side.

425
00:49:35,535 --> 00:49:36,601
Amen.

426
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,184
Sit down.

427
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,283
Listen ...

428
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,850
I'm only half as large as
90% of the prisoners here

429
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:53,512
I guarantee you that I am the last
person I want to piss you off.

430
00:49:55,023 --> 00:49:56,942
Ricky, you must shut up.

431
00:49:57,726 --> 00:50:00,049
Can I just be alone with my son, please?

432
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,800
I'll wait in the hallway.

433
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,685
What do you say nigga?
You mean nothing to me.

434
00:50:13,686 --> 00:50:17,013
I know. I know I have nothing proposal.

435
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,965
And I know I mean nothing to you,
I know what you mean.

436
00:50:21,297 --> 00:50:26,298
Why do you always talk to me?
- Because there no longer will be. Therefore.

437
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:34,209
Are you being transferred?
- Yes, I am transferred.

438
00:50:35,112 --> 00:50:38,334
That's good, because then I
no more to do with you.

439
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:41,285
Where they send you the way to go?

440
00:50:42,804 --> 00:50:45,004
I have a brain tumor.

441
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,427
What?
- I have a brain tumor.

442
00:50:55,002 --> 00:50:56,263
Damn!

443
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,074
Why are you telling me this?

444
00:51:03,002 --> 00:51:07,600
You expect me to pity you do?
- No, not me, nigga.

445
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,567
No, I do not pity.

446
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:13,814
We are father and son.

447
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,375
During the last days
I have left on earth,

448
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:20,727
I thought that we normally
call could carry.

449
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:28,023
And I said all this nonsense
you die for me ..

450
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:29,533
That shit was true.

451
00:51:30,122 --> 00:51:33,108
No, that shit was true.
I was really dying for you.

452
00:51:34,204 --> 00:51:38,230
I was not for you.
I was dead to me.

453
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,102
I was dead for my family.
You're right.

454
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:45,365
That I earned.

455
00:51:45,661 --> 00:51:48,226
God works in mysterious ways.

456
00:51:48,943 --> 00:51:53,607
I had a lump in my family.
So God sent me "blessed" with cancer.

457
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:57,070
So God's ways, son.

458
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,430
You get back what you provided.

459
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:06,494
What are you doing?

460
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:18,043
Listen, brothers ...

461
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:23,015
God will forgive you everything ...

462
00:52:24,397 --> 00:52:30,617
you if you repent from your heart.
It must come from your heart.

463
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:35,788
The pain from your heart.
And the conversion must also come from your heart.

464
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:41,676
And he will not just forgive.

465
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:44,183
So our man, just.

466
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:50,000
You make a mistake on this planet,
, and connect you through life.

467
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:53,525
Do you understand me?
- Yes.

468
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:03,134
Son, I'm not saying I
do not know what love is ...

469
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:07,395
I do not know if I ever have loved someone.

470
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:09,512
But ...

471
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:14,185
... I feel something in my heart for you.

472
00:53:16,052 --> 00:53:21,371
I'm a sissy, I'm not saying I do yours.
I say something in my heart I feel for you.

473
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:23,426
Do you understand me?
- Sure, Dad.

474
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:33,674
Cain?

475
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,367
Here is the book you've asked me.

476
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:39,653
BRAIN TUMORS

477
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,272
Cain, everything okay there?

478
00:53:57,728 --> 00:54:00,348
Willie?
- Yes?

479
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:04,206
Can you play something quiet today?

480
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:07,310
Yeah, right.

481
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:10,205
Sure.

482
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:15,558
Smoke there is only one.
- Thanks.

483
00:54:16,766 --> 00:54:18,013
Have you been removed from the hole?

484
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:24,439
Yes, the director has given me one hour with you,

485
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,091
but I had some company with you.
- That's right.

486
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,898
Does it hurt?

487
00:54:36,058 --> 00:54:41,450
Yes, it takes a while before the pain goes away.

488
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:45,929
Did she tell you how long you have left?

489
00:54:50,002 --> 00:54:51,755
Long enough.

490
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:58,464
Son, I want you to promise me something.

491
00:55:00,306 --> 00:55:05,057
Is your sentence here.
And promise me you'll never come back.

492
00:55:06,248 --> 00:55:08,859
And you also ensure that others
not reach here.

493
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:12,012
Screw this with the elite.

494
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:17,445
Cain ...
- Yes.

495
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:21,770
I need a favor.
- For Harlow?

496
00:55:24,664 --> 00:55:26,322
I see that you can handle right now.

497
00:55:27,522 --> 00:55:31,414
The favor ... I'll collect.
- What favor?

498
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:34,602
I'm not talking to you, nigga.
- Watch what you say, pal.

499
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:40,384
So that's the deal?
- Yes, that's about it, what do you doing?

500
00:55:41,265 --> 00:55:44,289
My favor.
- Let us know.

501
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,487
I need help
to "stuff" to get inside.

502
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:51,379
What "stuff"?

503
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:53,576
Same as always.

504
00:55:54,328 --> 00:55:58,783
I'm 23 hours a day in solitary.
How do I get your stuff in here?

505
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:00,716
That's not my problem.

506
00:56:01,286 --> 00:56:04,535
When you asked me for help, I asked
not "How do I manage that?"

507
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:08,651
I just did it.
- I hear you, homie.

508
00:56:08,652 --> 00:56:12,333
You see, loyal soldiers.

509
00:56:13,368 --> 00:56:15,233
So they are gone.

510
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:29,758
<i> I understand, it continues,
but then we're done with that bastard. </ i>

511
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:34,586
With everything.
- Do it, nigga.

512
00:57:48,206 --> 00:57:51,406
Cain, you have to take medicines.

513
00:57:52,811 --> 00:57:55,991
You need a lot of pain.
- I take no medication.

514
00:57:55,992 --> 00:57:59,095
I know you do not want to take,
but you have to take them.

515
00:57:59,096 --> 00:58:00,685
Shut up.

516
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:05,075
Cain, the medications are not
only for pain relief.

517
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:08,867
Raise your hand against me.
Get out.

518
00:58:09,408 --> 00:58:14,376
I take no medication
Call monitor so I can get away.

519
00:58:14,377 --> 00:58:16,078
Security!

520
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,084
The blood of Jesus.

521
00:58:34,276 --> 00:58:36,059
The blood of Jesus.

522
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:38,867
The blood of Jesus.

523
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:44,014
The blood of Jesus.

524
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:50,389
The blood of Jesus.

525
00:58:51,918 --> 00:58:54,537
The blood of Jesus.
- How you doing, Dad?

526
00:58:55,289 --> 00:58:58,189
Tell me, son?
- What did the doctor say?

527
00:58:59,686 --> 00:59:01,499
It does not matter.

528
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:05,691
The Lord will never give
if you can bear.

529
00:59:06,531 --> 00:59:07,963
Remember that.

530
00:59:09,499 --> 00:59:13,375
The life I lead,
is the life I was given ...

531
00:59:13,853 --> 00:59:16,958
In the name of Jesus.
Amen.

532
00:59:18,693 --> 00:59:22,715
You know son, this is a blessing in disguise.

533
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:27,683
This is God's way to allow me
in contact with my son to come.

534
00:59:28,587 --> 00:59:30,963
A band to build.

535
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:39,577
I understand that.
- Pray with me?

536
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:43,370
Yes, we can pray together.

537
00:59:47,457 --> 00:59:49,031
Your hand ...

538
00:59:51,343 --> 00:59:52,821
Lord Jesus ...

539
00:59:53,779 --> 00:59:58,249
Thank you for your time
I gave up on this planet ...

540
00:59:59,055 --> 01:00:01,103
a bond with my son to build.

541
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:03,087
In Jez ...
- Dad!

542
01:00:03,855 --> 01:00:06,593
Dad!
Guard!

543
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,995
He's under a heavy anesthetic.
- How long do you think this will take?

544
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:23,759
It's hard to say,
if and when he wakes up.

545
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,283
He should at least put continue
to take his medication.

546
01:00:27,487 --> 01:00:29,075
Okay.

547
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:41,259
They told me you were the bastard in here.
- And you are?

548
01:00:41,923 --> 01:00:47,564
The bastard out.
- That means nothing to the asshole in here.

549
01:00:48,063 --> 01:00:51,537
What if me and my boys
outside triple your profit?

550
01:00:52,013 --> 01:00:56,057
As for myself I take away from some,
but a little ...

551
01:00:56,058 --> 01:00:58,752
Because I want that in here
try to be the bastard.

552
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:04,217
I thought you were looking for
a bastard who can arrange this for you.

553
01:01:07,005 --> 01:01:08,929
My asshole.

554
01:01:21,087 --> 01:01:24,569
The session today was good, man.
I think we have approached the children well.

555
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:29,321
A life of crime is real shit man.

556
01:01:30,523 --> 01:01:33,171
Going to end up in such a place like this,
Hellegatsplein this kind.

557
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:36,375
Joe ...

558
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:41,931
I need a favor.

559
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:44,969
Give this to my soldier, Derek.

560
01:02:04,194 --> 01:02:05,917
Cain is at your visit.

561
01:02:07,345 --> 01:02:08,874
Cain sits in solitary.

562
01:02:09,641 --> 01:02:12,597
He has asked the director
or you can join the pipeline project.

563
01:02:14,045 --> 01:02:18,433
So you can meet.

564
01:02:30,257 --> 01:02:31,893
Brother Cain ...

565
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:37,437
What's wrong?

566
01:02:38,027 --> 01:02:42,817
I want someone to ass.
But it does not have to do with you.

567
01:02:43,649 --> 01:02:46,773
Who are we?
And why?

568
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:53,433
JD Parker. I'll tell you no details
but nobody fucking with my son.

569
01:02:53,434 --> 01:02:57,419
I do business with JD.
- Not anymore.

570
01:02:57,929 --> 01:02:59,539
Is that so?

571
01:03:00,251 --> 01:03:02,507
So my word is nothing now?

572
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:07,855
Your word for me
what does not.

573
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:11,181
Therefore you had to come alone.

574
01:03:12,161 --> 01:03:14,945
I thought that a card would have to choose.

575
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,735
Do not be like I did not protect,
do you remember?

576
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:31,491
You run the drug trade because I allow.

577
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:33,563
But JD ...

578
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:36,395
is a dead guy.

579
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:39,041
And try not to turn ...

580
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:45,577
do not you dare to think that a nigga like me
permission to ask a nigga like you ...

581
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:47,297
to get something done.

582
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,293
It's time for some to do.
- For sure.

583
01:04:04,294 --> 01:04:08,325
Cain, the bastard of a son, Derek,
I want them all dead.

584
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:12,839
Damn, homie, Cain
something like a legend here.

585
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:17,187
You are about to become history.
take that motherfucker to graze. And hell out now.

586
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,151
Got it?

587
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:29,261
I warned you, nigga,
watch what I do with that sissy.

588
01:04:29,262 --> 01:04:33,117
Do you understand me?
Let me not to fool.

589
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:36,199
Spread the word.
- Yes.

590
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:42,021
Yes, I'll tell you about.
- Get out of here.

591
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:47,373
How did my deal for you?
- Better than expected.

592
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,033
I got 25% for you.
Sit down.

593
01:04:53,337 --> 01:04:57,567
You know what? Let 20% of it.
Consider it a favor.

594
01:04:58,179 --> 01:05:00,947
And give me the opportunity
to do business with you.

595
01:05:04,339 --> 01:05:07,783
This is the plan what we're doing.

596
01:05:11,399 --> 01:05:13,060
You may have Ricky.

597
01:05:14,307 --> 01:05:18,705
But Cain, that crazy dick will come after you.
Do not worry about.

598
01:05:21,261 --> 01:05:24,675
We need this in the right way.
Do you understand me?

599
01:05:25,015 --> 01:05:28,080
Cain has some followers here
and war is bad for business.

600
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:30,745
I control where and when.

601
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:35,557
You take Ricky to your account
I assume that a gorilla Cain on me.

602
01:05:35,592 --> 01:05:38,701
You and I are going together with money.

603
01:05:38,589 --> 01:05:40,321
That is agreed.

604
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:46,140
Cain, I need to know the truth.

605
01:05:48,438 --> 01:05:52,979
Everyone is silent on this,
but I know it's going to come.

606
01:05:54,307 --> 01:05:56,934
I hear drums in my head.

607
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:04,845
I live in the jungle when I hear the drums.

608
01:06:06,973 --> 01:06:11,165
The drums talk to me.
The storm is coming, baby.

609
01:06:11,918 --> 01:06:15,278
And there's nothing you can do about.
Nothing.

610
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:20,317
And I'm the one who has the most to lose.

611
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:26,297
We are talking about my son.
We are still talking about my son.

612
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:30,314
I know you like
the palm of my hand.

613
01:06:31,514 --> 01:06:35,826
And I know there is nothing
you would not do for your son.

614
01:06:35,827 --> 01:06:38,250
Includes self sacrifice.

615
01:06:41,307 --> 01:06:46,411
You can not do that.
- You might be put aside.

616
01:06:46,412 --> 01:06:48,069
This is a prison, Cain.

617
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:53,085
Some of the most dangerous criminals
walking around here. We can not do.

618
01:06:53,086 --> 01:06:54,905
That JD ...

619
01:06:56,601 --> 01:06:58,323
... Is a killer.

620
01:07:00,093 --> 01:07:03,343
I see it in his eyes.
You know what that means.

621
01:07:04,247 --> 01:07:07,961
I have to kill JD.
- No. No.

622
01:07:07,962 --> 01:07:11,931
Yes.
- That will not happen in this prison.

623
01:07:11,932 --> 01:07:15,995
This is exactly the kind of behavior
so you back straight the hole goes.

624
01:07:17,588 --> 01:07:21,597
Would you do what I should do?
Would you return?

625
01:07:22,717 --> 01:07:28,411
I try very patient with you again.
- Can I go?

626
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:16,268
... I know how you look at me
as those who sit in the tubs ...

627
01:08:16,669 --> 01:08:21,365
and when the morning brings me the news,
your unrequited love.

628
01:08:25,765 --> 01:08:29,812
About Who are they?
- His name is JD.

629
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:32,719
Is there another
way to solve this problem?

630
01:08:32,861 --> 01:08:35,549
Not when the lives of
my son is on the set.

631
01:08:36,393 --> 01:08:41,233
What about you to me?
- I thought we were headed a different direction.

632
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:47,089
We read the Bible, pray and
trying to save another's soul.

633
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:51,265
I do not want no bad reason.

634
01:08:51,266 --> 01:08:53,593
It's not that I'm scared or anything.

635
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:57,169
You're one of the hardest
I know gangsters.

636
01:08:58,558 --> 01:09:03,031
I know you're not afraid.
You've grown.

637
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:08,423
God has a route for you sometimes secretly approaching.

638
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:11,325
Follow me as a better leader.

639
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,591
I must do this.

640
01:09:31,221 --> 01:09:34,005
Do you have that thing for me?

641
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:36,929
I'll handle it.

642
01:10:04,653 --> 01:10:06,909
What now?
- You tell me.

643
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:11,954
How you've slain my friend?
- I have not slain.

644
01:10:12,103 --> 01:10:15,031
I tried to say that asshole.
- You should have done.

645
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,330
The only thing I think
is to take your address.

646
01:10:19,379 --> 01:10:25,115
Ricky, I'm so glad to see you.
I can think of nothing else.

647
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:29,458
Money, freedom, hookers ...

648
01:10:30,305 --> 01:10:34,709
... To nowhere, just to you.
- I have not slain your partner.

649
01:10:35,255 --> 01:10:39,600
What happened, happened. We had
Mike does not like you had not been murdered.

650
01:10:40,515 --> 01:10:44,515
Right now, I am not interested
what brought us here.

651
01:10:45,271 --> 01:10:49,849
The only thing I care about is that we are here.
there should you worry about it.

652
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:55,478
Look, nigga. I had to say that homie
you wait until we had spoken.

653
01:10:55,479 --> 01:11:01,997
But he suddenly began to shoot. I wanted you
partner is not dead. I just wanted to scare you.

654
01:11:01,998 --> 01:11:05,138
Let's see how fast you come here.

655
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:10,328
What you want, nigga,
but I tell you once thing.

656
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:15,972
Your tired ... your father ...
and your fucking kids ...

657
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:20,785
assist your coffin nigga,
and watching bloody dead body.

658
01:11:21,633 --> 01:11:24,281
That is the key you just
have turned the lock.

659
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:54,833
What are you doing here, Brenda,
- It's about my son.

660
01:11:56,459 --> 01:12:00,473
He is in prison, Cain.
He's here with you.

661
01:12:02,513 --> 01:12:04,068
I'm sorry to hear that.

662
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,023
I want you it is quite capable
while sitting here, Cain. Please.

663
01:12:10,064 --> 01:12:13,791
I'm just a sinner who
righteous living.

664
01:12:16,084 --> 01:12:21,119
Cain ...
You're a man with authority.

665
01:12:22,223 --> 01:12:25,952
You're dangerous, Cain.
You're a 'boss'

666
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:29,681
No one dares to come on your path.

667
01:12:30,441 --> 01:12:33,921
Tell me ...
you're still that person?

668
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,811
I see what I can do.

669
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:40,894
Remember me
I went to Arizona?

670
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:47,568
When I left I was pregnant.

671
01:12:48,688 --> 01:12:51,432
I carried our baby.
- What?

672
01:12:54,555 --> 01:12:59,190
He is your son, Cain.
- Our child?

673
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,688
It's your blood, Cain.

674
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:11,231
He is the only thing I have, Cain.

675
01:13:12,094 --> 01:13:15,062
I want you to fit him, Cain.
Please.

676
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:18,758
His name is JD.

677
01:13:19,798 --> 01:13:22,534
His name is JD Parker.

678
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,995
Cain ...

679
01:13:27,378 --> 01:13:29,433
Please.

680
01:14:09,129 --> 01:14:13,938
Your buddy Derek is dead.
Something is happening with your son.

681
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:18,409
