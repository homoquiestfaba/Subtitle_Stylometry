I'm told you're brilliant.

894
01:02:13,459 --> 01:02:15,190
Well,
Lieutenant Commander Layton

895
01:02:15,192 --> 01:02:17,490
has been known to exaggerate.

896
01:02:17,492 --> 01:02:19,357
I hope not.

897
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,156
He told me
he's absolutely certain

898
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:22,390
the Japs are gonna hit Midway

899
01:02:22,392 --> 01:02:23,559
and I need to know

900
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:26,624
whether or not
I can believe him.

901
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:28,090
Well, if you don't
believe him,

902
01:02:28,092 --> 01:02:29,192
we'll all be
speaking Japanese.

903
01:02:30,726 --> 01:02:32,726
Or, most likely,
we'll be dead.

904
01:02:37,225 --> 01:02:38,325
Show me how this works.

905
01:02:38,859 --> 01:02:40,490
You mean, like a tour?

906
01:02:40,492 --> 01:02:41,559
Exactly.

907
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,657
Like a tour.

908
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,123
ROCHEFORT:
So, this is where it starts.

909
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:47,156
We intercept roughly 60%

910
01:02:47,158 --> 01:02:48,724
of secure Japanese
radio traffic

911
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:50,357
and we've cracked
enough of their code

912
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:53,323
to be able to break about 40%
of those messages.

913
01:02:53,325 --> 01:02:55,557
So, we're able to read
about a quarter

914
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,423
of their secure
communications?

915
01:02:57,425 --> 01:02:59,657
Uh, no, not exactly.

916
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:01,490
Here's some of our, uh,

917
01:03:01,492 --> 01:03:03,192
cracked messages.

918
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:07,223
NIMITZ: It's gibberish to me.

919
01:03:07,225 --> 01:03:09,657
Yes, but if you read
enough of it...

920
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:11,690
Rochefort has a gift
for assembling the fragments.

921
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:13,757
He can recall a message
from two months ago,

922
01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:16,290
and plug it
into today's intercept.

923
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,192
Explain the disagreement
with Washington.

924
01:03:19,259 --> 01:03:20,223
Well,

925
01:03:20,225 --> 01:03:23,757
we all have access
to the same raw information,

926
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:27,125
but, uh, over here,
is where our paths diverge.

Translation and analysis.

928
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:30,557
Now, Washington agrees with us

929
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,557
that Japs are gonna attack
a major target codenamed AF.

930
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,390
But Washington believes
that AF

931
01:03:35,392 --> 01:03:36,824
is located
in the South Pacific,

932
01:03:36,826 --> 01:03:40,190
which is why they ordered you
to keep <i>Enterprise</i> down there.

933
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,757
Do you have any direct proof
that they're wrong?

934
01:03:42,759 --> 01:03:44,125
Direct proof? No, but...

Imagine that
you're throwing a wedding.

And maybe I've never seen
the invitation,

938
01:03:52,392 --> 01:03:53,524
but I hear from the caterers

939
01:03:53,526 --> 01:03:55,457
that they have an event
on a certain date.

Not a definitive answer.

Sir? After Pearl, you told me
to stick to my guns.

But...

953
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:28,824
I'll figure a way to get
the <i>Enterprise</i> back here.

954
01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:33,292
Meantime, you gentlemen
need to convince Washington

955
01:04:34,692 --> 01:04:37,724
that the Japs' real target
is Midway.

956
01:04:37,726 --> 01:04:38,624
How, sir?

957
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,624
Washington doesn't
exactly have a habit

958
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:41,792
of listening to us.

01:04:43,492 --> 01:04:45,025

964
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:12,156
He wants us to be spotted.

965
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,123
Because if the Japs see us,

966
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,690
we can break
our standing orders

967
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:17,792
with Washington
and return to Pearl.

Yeah. Okay.

Well, keep me informed.

974
01:05:39,225 --> 01:05:40,557
That was Washington.

975

of their upcoming attack

is out of fresh water.

Interesting, sir.

979
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:53,257
I heard that
Midway accidentally sent out

980
01:05:53,259 --> 01:05:54,824
an unencrypted transmission

981
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:57,290
that their water plant
was broken.

982
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:58,759

broken?

Not that I know of, sir.

Mr. Ford,

993
01:06:42,592 --> 01:06:44,690
that I've ever helped

994
01:06:44,692 --> 01:06:46,457
scout for a movie before.

995
01:06:46,459 --> 01:06:47,757

you planning to make

in the Navy said

that I might be able
to find some real action here.

We're headed back to Pearl
to resupply,

1011

because something big

1,000 feet up in the sky,
no ropes, nothing.
