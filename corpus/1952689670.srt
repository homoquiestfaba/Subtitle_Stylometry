00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,367
Man:

A REALLY WONDERFUL FLOW.

2
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:21,186
IT'S PERFECT
FOR ENTERTAINING

3
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,423
OR ENJOYING AN
INDOOR-OUTDOOR LIFESTYLE.

4
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,926
YOU SEE HOW EACH OF
THE ROOMS IS CONNECTED?
IT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT?

5
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:31,346
THE KITCHEN HAS ALL
THE MODERN APPLIANCES.

6
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:34,649
AND RIGHT THROUGH HERE,
THERE'S A SMALLER BEDROOM.

7
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,957
IT'S PERFECT FOR CHILDREN.

00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:49,631
IT'S PEACEFUL
OUT HERE, ISN'T IT?

9
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,866
Woman:
GARDEN LOOKS LIKE
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

10
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:55,420
ACTUALLY, YOU'D BE
SURPRISED HOW WELL
IT MAINTAINS ITSELF.

11
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:58,423
Man:
THE ROOF LOOKS KINDA OLD.

12
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:00,391
Realtor:
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE KITCHEN YET?

13
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:01,976
THE MARBLE'S WONDERFUL.

14
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,831
(chain clicks)

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,695
- THANKS VERY MUCH.
- OH. THANKS FOR
STOPPING BY.

16
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:23,197
- DID I GIVE YOU MY CARD?
- YES.  WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

17
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:26,468
- ALL RIGHT.
THANKS AGAIN.
- THANK YOU.

18
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,136
BYE NOW.

19
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,114
HELLO?

20
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,124
(panting)

21
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:41,493
- Woman: HELLO? CARL?
- HEY.  ALICE.

22
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,427
I'M DOWN HERE.

23
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,062
IS IT HOT OUT?

24
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,936
- HOW'D IT GO?
- UH, IT WENT OKAY.

25
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,774
- THAT BAD, HUH?
- IT'S A TOUGH MARKET.

26
00:02:56,775 --> 00:03:00,845
WE COULD WAIT A FEW MONTHS,
SEE IF THINGS TURN AROUND.

27
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:08,619
LOOK, I KNOW YOU
HAD DIFFERENT PLANS
FOR THE HOUSE.

28
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,607
IT'S OKAY.

29
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:15,693
- Alice: I'M SORRY.
- (chuckles)

30
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,698
YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS
HERE FOR YOU, ALICE,

31
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,717
IF YOU EVER--
IF YOU EVER WANNA TALK.

32
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:24,852
THANKS, CARL.

33
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:29,173
- BYE.
- BYE. YEAH.

34
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,603
(shower running)

35
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:18,339
Alice on film:
Honey, what do you think
of this room

36
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,141
for a new nursery?

37
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,663
Man on film:
I think we could fit
a pool table in here.

38
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:27,665
Alice on film:
Josh, you're a dork.

39
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,373
- (both chuckling)
- Alice: Oh God.

40
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:37,525
(remote clicks)

41
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:44,899
(glasses clinking)

42
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,319
- SO THE CAR WAS TOTALED.
- YOU MEAN MY CAR
WAS TOTALED.

43
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,954
WELL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LET OSCAR

44
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,422
DRIVE YOUR CAR
IN THE SNOW.

45
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,091
Man:
UH-UH. I WAS NOT DRIVING.

46
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,959
SO WHO WAS DRIVING?
WALTER?

47
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,395
- OSCAR.  OSCAR.
- (all laugh)

48
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:00,882
- OSCAR, WHEN'S HE BACK
FROM BERLIN?
- TWO WEEKS.

49
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,685
HEY, IS THERE
ANY MORE OF THIS WINE?

50
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,553
YEAH.

51
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,024
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

52
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,077
YOU TALKED
TO HIM RECENTLY?

53
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:16,280
NOT REALLY.
I MEAN, I TOLD HIM
I WAS SELLING THE HOUSE.

54
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:18,115
GOOD.

55
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:20,001
HE SAID I WAS
BEING IRRATIONAL.

56
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:24,622
ACTUALLY, WHAT HE SAID
WAS "OVERLY EMOTIONAL."
HIS FAVORITE.

57
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:27,441
WELL, THEN YOU CAN TELL HIM
HE CAN KEEP PAYING HIS
HALF OF THE MORTGAGE.

58
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:31,780
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY?
SCREW HIM. IS HE REALLY
THAT OUT OF TOUCH?

59
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,149
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING.

60
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,284
YOU KNOW?
A GOOD CLEAN BREAK.

61
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:38,219
THAT WHAT YOUR
THERAPIST SAID?

62
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,155
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T AFFORD HER ANYMORE.

63
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:54,969
GOD, YOU ARE SUCH
A LIGHTWEIGHT.

64
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,006
I KNOW IT'S, LIKE,
ONLY A COUPLE DATES,

65
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:00,308
BUT I REALLY THINK
HE MIGHT BE THE ONE.

66
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:05,146
- ALICE, ARE YOU EVEN AWAKE?
- YEAH, I'M AWAKE.

67
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,314
(laughs)
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

68
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:09,233
YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD
FEELING ABOUT HIM.

69
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,509
(crickets chirping)

70
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,878
JENNIE?

71
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,889
JENN, YOU UP HERE?

72
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:54,612
JENN.

73
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:03,270
JENN?

74
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:26,594
(door opens, creaks)

75
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,214
(water running)

76
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:09,821
JENNIE, WHERE ARE YOU?

77
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:29,257
JENNIE?

78
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:35,997
JENNIE, ARE YOU THERE?

79
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:37,965
THIS BETTER NOT
BE A JOKE.

80
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,087
(creaks)

81
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,341
JENN?

82
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,697
JENNIE, ARE YOU THERE?

83
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,271
JENNIE?

84
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,478
JENNIE?

85
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,515
(shrieking)

86
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,959
(thudding footsteps)

87
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,551
(murmurs)

88
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,597
(muffled panting)

89
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,706
(door opens, creaks)

90
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,343
(latches clicking)

91
00:09:58,046 --> 00:09:59,981
(muffled whimpering,
protesting)

92
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:04,352
(muffled)
NO NO NO!

93
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:56,670
VERY NICE.

94
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,146
I LOVE THE MARBLE.

95
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:32,123
I LOVE IT.
IT'S HOME.

96
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:37,728
(ringing)

97
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:41,798
HI, ALICE, IT'S ME.
I'M GONNA SWING BY
AND PICK UP MY GOLF CLUBS.

98
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,501
I THOUGHT
I COULD HAVE A LOOK
AT THE HOT TUB FOR YOU.

99
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:47,171
ARE YOU THERE?
I'M IN HOLLYWOOD

100
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:50,007
SO I'M GONNA BE BY
PRETTY SOON.

101
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:51,776
(beeps)

102
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:09,593
ALICE?

103
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,115
ANYONE HOME?

104
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,519
HI THERE.

105
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,504
HELLO.

106
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:40,724
I'M JOSH.
I'M ALICE'S EX.

107
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:43,610
I'M LILA.
I'M JUST VISITING.

108
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,899
DO YOU KNOW
IF ALICE IS HOME?

109
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,801
ALICE? NO.
NO, SHE'S NOT IN.

110
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:54,322
SHE ASKED ME TO CHECK
THE TIMER ON THE HOT TUB.

111
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,707
BY ALL MEANS.

112
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,280
- HOW'S THE TEMPERATURE?
- IT'S PERFECT.

113
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:04,982
GREAT.

114
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:14,075
SO, UM, HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA BE IN TOWN FOR?

115
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:16,543
JUST A FEW DAYS.

116
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:19,313
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE LONGER.

117
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:20,664
REALLY, IT ALL DEPENDS.

118
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,119
WOULD YOU BE A DARLING
AND FILL MY GLASS?

119
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,355
THE BOTTLE'S ON THE TABLE.

120
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:29,090
SURE.

121
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:43,738
- YOU WANT A GLASS?
- I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING.

122
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,708
WHY? YOU GOT TO
RUSH OFF SOMEWHERE?

123
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,462
NOT REALLY.
JUST GOT SOME ERRANDS.

124
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:54,565
I SEE.

125
00:13:56,801 --> 00:14:00,637
IF YOU SEE ALICE,
COULD YOU TELL HER
I STOPPED BY?

126
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:02,740
- OF COURSE.
- ALL RIGHT.

127
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:06,177
NICE TO MEET YOU.

128
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,430
JOSH, CAN I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

129
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,751
- I'M SORRY?
- I'M TRYING TO DECIDE

130
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,653
IF I SHOULD TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT ALICE.

131
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,656
BUT FIRST I NEED TO ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION.

132
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,976
OKAY.

133
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:28,165
WHAT ARE YOUR TRUE
FEELINGS FOR HER?

134
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,969
- MY TRUE FEELINGS?
- ARE YOU STILL IN
LOVE WITH HER?

135
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,139
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
I STILL CARE FOR ALICE.

136
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,308
- OKAY.
- BUT I--

137
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,510
I DON'T THINK I'M
IN LOVE WITH HER ANYMORE.

138
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,562
WHAT HAPPENED?

139
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:44,915
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT FADED, I GUESS.

140
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,435
THAT'S WHY WE'RE APART.

141
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:53,573
UM, SO WHAT WAS
THIS INFORMATION?

142
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,662
COME ON.  HAVE SOME WINE.
ONE GLASS WON'T KILL YOU.

143
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:03,350
GO ON THEN.

144
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:17,214
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO TELL ME?

145
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:19,383
YOU'RE ALL BUSINESS,
AREN'T YOU, JOSH?

146
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:23,220
NO. I JUST HAVE THE FEELING
THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY
MESSING WITH ME.

147
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:25,522
WHAT IF I AM?

148
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:31,078
- HAVE YOU MET ANYONE NEW?
- NO.

149
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,864
UM, NOT SERIOUS ANYWAY.

150
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,718
WHY? HAS ALICE?
IS THAT IT?

151
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,953
NO. MAYBE.

152
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,740
I CAN'T BE SURE.

153
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,660
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU WITH ANYONE?

154
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:49,163
THERE IS SOMEONE.

155
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:51,365
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT WORK?

156
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:54,334
WE HAVE AN
OPEN RELATIONSHIP.

157
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:56,670
REALLY?

158
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,206
- MM-HMM.
- AND YOU'RE
COOL WITH THAT?

159
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,624
I THINK SO.

160
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,659
(chuckles)

161
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,196
IT'S A LITTLE
FRIGHTENING AT FIRST

162
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,499
WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE
OTHER DESIRES, YOU KNOW?

163
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:12,503
HOW DO YOU ADMIT
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

164
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,605
TO THE PERSON
THAT MOST COMPLETES YOU?

165
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,958
BUT IF YOU CROSS
THE LINE TOGETHER

166
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,294
AND YOU'RE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER,

167
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:23,713
IT CAN BRING YOU CLOSER.

168
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:27,284
YOU TELL HIM EVERYTHING?

169
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:28,819
THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL.

170
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,206
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
DO YOU BELIEVE HE
TELLS YOU EVERYTHING?

171
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:33,924
OF COURSE.

172
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:43,550
(inaudible conversation)

173
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:50,140
...NOT GUILTY.

174
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,593
- DO YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT SOMETHING?
- NO.

175
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,595
NOR DO I.

176
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:59,016
YOU REALLY--
YOU ARE QUITE SOMETHING.

177
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:06,440
WHAT WAS THE--
WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TELL ME?

178
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,626
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU
ON ONE CONDITION--

179
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:12,696
YOU HAVE TO GET
IN THE WATER.

180
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,765
NO WAY.  NO.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

181
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:17,134
WHAT IF ALICE
GETS BACK AND SEES ME?
SHE'LL KILL ME.

182
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:19,069
SHE'S NOT GONNA
BE BACK ANYTIME SOON.

183
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:24,558
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU?
I'M HOUSESITTING.

184
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,360
SO?

185
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:32,432
LOOK.
NOW YOU'RE ALL WET.

186
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:35,302
NOW YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO COME IN.

187
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,901
(thudding footsteps)

188
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,870
(inhales weakly)

189
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:10,804
- MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T.
- THEN STOP.

190
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:32,509
(panting, moaning)

191
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:46,190

192
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,500
(whimpers faintly)

193
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,804
Lila: DAVID?

194
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,202
(saw buzzing faintly)

195
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,764
IT'S SO QUIET HERE.

196
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:03,600
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET
THE NEIGHBORS.

197
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:06,887
(fork clinks)

198
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,743
IT WAS FUN TODAY,
WASN'T IT?

199
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:20,800
AFTER DINNER, WILL YOU
SET UP THE VIDEO?

200
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,766
- (grunts softly)
- (chains jingle)

201
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:48,095
HMM.

202
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,577
SHE HAD GOOD TASTE.

203
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:24,665
YOU KNOW, IT'S ACTUALLY
BEEN A PRETTY LONG DAY.

204
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,157
DAVID.

205
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:38,812
YOU'RE HAPPY
I'M BACK, RIGHT?

206
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:49,339
GOOD NIGHT, DAVID.

207
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,957

211
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,164
Don't lock us in.

212
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:16,199
Obviously.

213
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,101
(kissing on film)

214
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:22,072
(mumbles)

215
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:28,678
It's pretty hard
to do.

216
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,347
(giggles)
You're very talented.

217
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:38,539
- Cheers to?
- To...

218
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,574

NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU.

232
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:37,206
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

233
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,746

00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:01,331
DRINK.

236
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,205
IF SHE FINDS OUT
YOU'RE ALIVE,
YOU'LL DIE.

237
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,559
OKAY.

238
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,761
I HAVE TO WORK.

239
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:27,874
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO READ?

240
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,895
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

257
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:36,102
THIS IS OUR SECRET.

259
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,811

SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:10,263
Lila:
I MET A FRIEND
FOR A DRINK, OKAY?

00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:29,899
I'M SORRY I YELLED.
I DON'T WANT TO YELL.

I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAS TO CHANGE, YOU KNOW.

269
00:29:40,394 --> 00:29:42,562
I KNOW.

270

- LAUNDRY.

271
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,845
- I CAN DO THAT.

272
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:01,464
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
I DON'T MIND--

00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:03,816
DAVID, PLEASE.
I'M TRYING.

274
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,976

THANK YOU.

279
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,427
YOU CUT THE CRUSTS OFF.

280
00:31:56,764 --> 00:32:00,650
MY MOM USED TO DO THAT.

281
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,170
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO.

282
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,592
IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

283
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:12,411
BUT IF THIS
IS GONNA WORK,

284
00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:15,448
WE NEED TO BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

285
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:17,433
OKAY?

286
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:19,285
I'M SORRY.

WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,609
YEAH, BUT IT'S MY FAULT.
I'LL STILL PAY YOU.

301
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,146

crying)

318

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

328
00:36:29,336 --> 00:36:32,822
EVERYTHING FITS.
SHE MUST'VE BEEN YOUR TYPE.

329
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,174
HOW DID SHE WEAR HER HAIR?

330
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,392
LIKE THIS?

331
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,228
I DON'T REMEMBER.

333
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:52,408
DID SHE HAVE A NICE ASS?

334
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:55,077

¶ ...off on a friend ¶

354
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,456
¶ Well, I thought
I heard you say... ¶

355
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:32,592
DON'T STOP.

356
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:37,763
¶ But I can't give up looks
until it's away ¶

357
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:42,885
(music swells,
echoing)

358
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,180
- DAVID?
- I DON'T--

359
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:58,233
DAVID?

360
00:38:58,234 --> 00:39:00,603
I DON'T--
I DON'T FEEL WELL.

361
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:10,630
(music stops)

362
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,415
(retching)

363
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:15,852
WHAT'S WRONG, DAVID?
ARE YOU OKAY?

364
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,054
NOTHING.
I'M FINE.

365
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,625
- ARE YOU CRYING?
- NO.

366
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,863
I DON'T FEEL WELL.

367
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,199
DAVID, TAKE MY HAND.
COME ON, YOU NEED
TO LAY DOWN.

368
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:33,102
COME ON.
COME ON.

369
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:34,737
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

370
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,294
DO YOU WANT A WET TOWEL
FOR YOUR HEAD?

371
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,095
I'M OKAY.

372
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:44,830
I'LL GET YOU ONE.

373
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:51,720
(faucet running)

374
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:54,306
(shuts off)

375
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:16,329
(kisses)

376
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:35,414
I MISS YOU.

377
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:42,588
WILL YOU COME UPSTAIRS?

378
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:04,777
I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY LOVE ME.

379
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,714
OF COURSE I DO.

380
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:11,683
IF YOU LOVED ME,
YOU'D MAKE ME STOP.

381
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:14,753
YOU'RE SO FUCKING WEAK.

382
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,227
I TRIED
TO MAKE YOU STOP.

383
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,995
YOU LEFT ME.

384
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:52,090
Reporter: And there was
another drive-by shooting
today downtown.

385
00:41:52,091 --> 00:41:54,226
It appears to be
gang-related.

386
00:41:54,227 --> 00:41:56,746
Reporter #2:
The victim was taken away
unconscious,

387
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,881
but is expected
to recover fully

388
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:01,250
and should be able
to help police with
information.

389
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:03,118
Well, the crime rate
in this country

390
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,987
for the first time
in 50--

391
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:08,307
Chef on TV:
And then I like
to put in three tablespoons,

392
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:12,211
one, two, three,
of olive oil.

393
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:14,647
This baby needs
a good pinch of salt.

394
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:20,169
First of all,
that's very very very good.

395
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,971
And what it wants
is the following:
a little more--

396
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,160
(David screaming)

397
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:31,123
(grunts weakly)

398
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:33,642
(cries out)

399
00:43:50,176 --> 00:43:51,660
(cries out)

400
00:43:58,134 --> 00:44:01,303
YOU'RE STIFF.
YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR BODY.

401
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,926
COME ON.

402
00:44:09,695 --> 00:44:12,197
(cries out)

403
00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:14,116
GO AHEAD.
GET UP ON THERE.

404
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:20,422
YOU CAN DO IT.

405
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:26,962
GOOD.
MOVE YOUR FEAT.

406
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:34,486
FASTER.
COME ON, MOVE YOUR FEET.

407
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:19,731
(shower pattering)

408
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:30,226
(handle squeaks,
water stops)

409
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,362
(shower door clacks)

410
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:06,211
I'M SORRY
THAT I BEAT YOU.

411
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:27,015
(grunts softly)

412
00:46:35,742 --> 00:46:38,143
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE THIS WAY.

413
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:41,563
YOU COULD GET AWAY
AND I COULD HELP YOU.

414
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,566
WE COULD HELP EACH OTHER.

415
00:46:46,702 --> 00:46:48,420
YOU'RE NOT LIKE HER.

416
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:52,208
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

417
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,976
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
REALLY?

418
00:46:58,915 --> 00:47:00,649
LET'S JUST GO RIGHT NOW.

419
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,103
OKAY?

420
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:15,147
LET'S JUST GO.

421
00:47:18,317 --> 00:47:19,768
(whispers)
LET'S GO.

422
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:21,069
(knocks on door)

423
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:26,992
ALICE?
HELLO?

424
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:32,731
AH.
I GUESS SHE'S NOT HOME.

425
00:47:32,732 --> 00:47:35,384
- YOU SURE IT'S OKAY.
- IT'S TOTALLY FINE.

426
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,371
PLEASE COME IN.

427
00:47:39,372 --> 00:47:42,541
SO THE HOUSE
HAS A WONDERFUL FLOW.

428
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:44,576
YOU SEE HOW ALL THE--

429
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:47,379
YOU SEE HOW ALL THE ROOMS
ARE CONNECTED?

430
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,847
WONDERFUL.

431
00:47:48,848 --> 00:47:52,384
ORIGINAL HARDWOOD FLOORS.
I LOVE THE STUDS.

432
00:47:52,385 --> 00:47:54,219
(both chuckle)

433
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,205
IT'S HER.
GET IN THIS CLOSET.

434
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:01,410
SO HERE IS THE KITCHEN.

435
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,612
I LOVE THE MARBLE.

436
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:05,113
IT'S NICE, RIGHT?

437
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:07,749
AND CHECK OUT THE GARDEN.

438
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,651
- PEACEFUL.
- IT'S VERY PEACEFUL.

439
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,222
WHERE ARE THE BEDROOMS?

440
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:17,492
UM, THERE'S
A SMALLER BEDROOM
RIGHT THROUGH HERE.

441
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:20,862
THERE'S TWO MORE
BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS,
INCLUDING THE MASTER.

442
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:25,500
- IT'S...
- PERFECT FOR CHILDREN.

443
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,269
RIGHT?

444
00:48:29,772 --> 00:48:32,774
SO SHE'S GOT IT SET UP
PRETTY NICELY WITH THE
FLAT SCREEN RIGHT THERE.

445
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:35,077
MMN.

446
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,080
AH, AND THE BATHROOM
HAS A FULL SHOWER.

447
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,581
I'LL TAKE IT.

448
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:43,251
(chuckles)
EXCUSE ME?

449
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:44,970
I WANT THIS HOUSE.

450
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:46,688
WOW, GREAT.

451
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:49,224
UM, THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT.

452
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:51,977
- I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION.
- OKAY.

453
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:54,529
IT'S A BIT OF A PERSONAL
QUESTION, ACTUALLY.

454
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:56,365
FIRE AWAY.

455
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,400
I WAS WONDERING.
DO YOU EVER GET TEMPTED?

456
00:49:00,286 --> 00:49:04,139
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

457
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,660
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

458
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:10,612
(chuckles)

459
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:16,067
OKAY.
YOU HAD ME THERE
FOR A SECOND.

460
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:18,487
(laughs)

461
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,825
SO ARE YOU INTERESTED?

462
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:25,527
ARE YOU?

463
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:30,666
(chuckles)

464
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,334
WOW, OKAY.

465
00:49:32,335 --> 00:49:35,236
UM, OKAY.

466
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:36,972
YOU DON'T
FIND ME ATTRACTIVE?

467
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,907
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

468
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:40,692
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED,
ARE YOU?

469
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:43,295
NO.
THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE--

470
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:45,747
- UM...
- HM?

471
00:49:45,748 --> 00:49:47,832
- SHE'LL NEVER KNOW.
- YEAH.

472
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:49,818
I PROMISE.

473
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:52,287
OKAY.

474
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:54,255
UM...

475
00:49:56,626 --> 00:50:00,329
- NO, I REALLY--
I REALLY CAN'T DO THIS.
- SHH.

476
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,231
- (soft thud)
- WAIT.

477
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:08,053
- I THINK THERE'S
SOMEONE HERE.
- DON'T BE SILLY.

478
00:50:08,054 --> 00:50:09,020
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
NO.

479
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:12,591
HELLO?
HELLO?

480
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,560
IS ANYONE--

481
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:17,746
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

482
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:25,387
WHAT THE FUCK, DAVID?!

483
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,957
SERIOUSLY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

484
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:32,444
- (Carl gurgling)
- I'M SORRY.

485
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,981
WILL YOU MOVE HIM
TO THE BATH?

486
00:50:35,982 --> 00:50:38,517
I DON'T WANT THE BLOOD
SOAKING THROUGH TO THE
CEILING DOWNSTAIRS.

487
00:50:41,887 --> 00:50:45,490
DAVID, DID YOU HEAR ME?

488
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:49,027
YES.

489
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,082
(Alice shivering)

490
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,874
(coughs wetly)

491
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,261
HE'S NOT DEAD.

492
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:23,828
I CUT HIS ARTERY.
HE WILL BE.

493
00:51:29,135 --> 00:51:31,085
- LILA.
- YES?

494
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:34,273
WHAT?

495
00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:37,576
NOTHING.

496
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:39,545
I'M GONNA USE
THE OTHER SHOWER.

497
00:51:48,153 --> 00:51:51,089
I THINK I'D LIKE TO THROW
A DINNER PARTY.

498
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,724
REALLY?

499
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:54,759
WHAT, YOU DON'T
THINK WE SHOULD?

500
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:00,282
I WAS JUST--
WE BARELY SPEND
ANY TIME HERE JUST US.

501
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,767
WE'LL HAVE TO BE
ON THE MOVE SOON ANYWAY.

502
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:05,153
- (phone rings)
- (answering machine beeps)

503
00:52:05,154 --> 00:52:07,722
Hey, it's Oscar.
I'm just checking up on you.

504
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,758
We got the message
from your doctor.

505
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,877
Hope you got your voice back
and you're feeling better.

506
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:16,198
Anyway, in case you were
wondering, the office is
so boring without you.

507
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,383
Call me, okay?
I want to know you're okay.

508
00:52:18,384 --> 00:52:20,352
Just call me.
Love you.  Bye.

509
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:24,489
WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT?

510
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,358
TOMORROW?

511
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:29,044
WHAT, YOU HAVE OTHER PLANS?

512
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,518
I WONDER
WHAT I SHOULD WEAR.

513
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:20,845
(latch clicks)

514
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,521
ALICE.

515
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:34,276
(whispers)
ALICE.

516
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:43,334
HERE'S A BLANKET.

517
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:47,221
Alice:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

518
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:50,275
IT'S OKAY.
SHE'S ASLEEP.

519
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:21,339
HERE.
THIS'LL KEEP YOU WARM.

520
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,986
I WANT TO STOP.

521
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:38,122
REALLY?

522
00:54:38,123 --> 00:54:39,824
YEAH.

523
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:43,394
THEN YOU'LL HAVE
TO LEAVE HER.

524
00:54:45,665 --> 00:54:47,365
I KNOW.

525
00:54:49,134 --> 00:54:51,469
IT'LL BE OKAY.

526
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:06,918
WILL YOU COME
WITH ME?

527
00:55:10,823 --> 00:55:12,491
YEAH.

528
00:55:12,492 --> 00:55:14,125
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

529
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,245
- (door opens, creaks)
- Lila: DAVID?

530
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:19,281
(both gasp)

531
00:55:23,886 --> 00:55:25,804
DAVID.

532
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:49,277
(door closes)

533
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,327
WHERE'D YOU GO?

534
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,929
I WAS IN THE GARAGE.

535
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,281
OH.

536
00:56:10,282 --> 00:56:12,451
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU
TALKING TO SOMEONE.

537
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,953
NO.

538
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,388
I HAD TO CHECK ON
SOMETHING.

539
00:56:18,991 --> 00:56:20,842
WHAT?

540
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:22,977
- ONE OF THE BODIES.
- OH.

541
00:56:27,883 --> 00:56:29,117
ARE THEY ROTTING?

542
00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:33,688
YEAH.
THEY'RE STARTING TO.

543
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,328
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

544
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:44,298
GOT LONELY UP THERE
ALL BY MYSELF.

545
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:48,870
I COULDN'T FIND YOU.

546
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:51,289
I'M SORRY.

547
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,546
GOOD NIGHT, DAVID.

548
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,714
GOOD NIGHT, LILA.

549
00:57:59,224 --> 00:58:03,011
(zipper zips)

550
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:37,128
DAVID?

551
00:58:37,129 --> 00:58:40,348
DAVID!

552
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:06,941
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT
WITHOUT ME.

553
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:22,340
THANK YOU.

554
00:59:42,828 --> 00:59:45,996
DAVID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

555
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:48,399
PREPARING DINNER.

556
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:52,137
YOU COULD HELP
IF YOU'D LIKE.

557
00:59:56,142 --> 00:59:59,444
DON'T DO THIS, OKAY?

558
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,181
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

559
01:00:09,154 --> 01:00:10,855
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO STOP.

560
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:18,462
YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK DOWNSTAIRS.

561
01:00:21,466 --> 01:00:24,119
WHY?

562
01:00:27,372 --> 01:00:28,840
I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M DIFFERENT.

563
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:31,992
BUT LILA'S PART OF ME.

564
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,680
(phone ringing)

565
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,621
Hey, Alice.
It's Oscar again.

566
01:00:43,622 --> 01:00:45,757
- I still haven't heard
from you. Are you okay?
- (scraping)

567
01:00:45,758 --> 01:00:47,676
I'm starting
to get really worried.

568
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,260
Call me.

569
01:00:49,261 --> 01:00:51,196
(scraping continues)

570
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:02,807
- DAVID, WHAT TIME IS IT?
- IT'S ALMOST 8:00.

571
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:06,277
ARE THERE
ANY MORE CANDLES?
I THINK WE NEED MORE CANDLES.

572
01:01:06,278 --> 01:01:08,429
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
DECANT THE RED WINE?

573
01:01:11,016 --> 01:01:13,050
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO?
- MAYBE.

574
01:01:13,051 --> 01:01:15,486
I WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT.

575
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:17,839
- IT IS PERFECT.
- SO?

576
01:01:24,362 --> 01:01:26,164
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- (giggles)

577
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:28,449
WHAT ABOUT THE SHOES?
TOO MUCH?

578
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,802
- THEY LOOK GOOD.
- THEY DO, DON'T THEY?

579
01:01:32,554 --> 01:01:35,055
HURRY UP AND CHANGE.
PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE
ARRIVING ANY MINUTE.

580
01:01:35,056 --> 01:01:36,858
I'M ALMOST DONE.

581
01:01:46,385 --> 01:01:49,304
- HI!
- HI!

582
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,639
LILA, THIS IS
MY FIANCÉ SETH.

583
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,926
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HI. HERE. WE BROUGHT
YOU SOME WINE.

584
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:57,561
OH, THANK YOU.
THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.

585
01:01:57,562 --> 01:02:00,632
DAVID'S JUST UPSTAIRS.
HE'LL BE DOWN IN A SECOND.

586
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,734
- I LOVE THIS HOUSE.
- OH, THANK YOU.

587
01:02:02,735 --> 01:02:04,802
WE'RE REALLY HAPPY HERE.

588
01:02:04,803 --> 01:02:06,354
PLEASE, COME ON IN.

589
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:09,057
(footsteps)

590
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,450
(mock laugh)

591
01:02:41,673 --> 01:02:43,941
THERE HE IS.

592
01:02:43,942 --> 01:02:46,461
DAVID, THIS IS
LAUREN AND SETH.

593
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,362
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

594
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:50,331
- HI.
- HI. WELCOME.

595
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:53,367
THANK YOU.
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR INVITING US.

596
01:02:53,368 --> 01:02:55,386
OF COURSE.
WE LOVE MEETING
NEW PEOPLE.

597
01:02:55,387 --> 01:02:58,873
DAVID, SETH AND LAUREN
JUST MOVED HERE
FROM SEATTLE.

598
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:00,007
NO.
UH, SAN FRANCISCO.

599
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:03,110
OH, RIGHT!
SAN FRANCISCO.
I'M SORRY.

600
01:03:03,111 --> 01:03:04,712
AND YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
IS THAT RIGHT?

601
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:08,482
THAT'S RIGHT.
I JUST STARTED MY
RESIDENCY AT CEDARS-SINAI.

602
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:10,017
SO HOW DID
YOU AND LILA MEET?

603
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:12,136
WE MET AT THE NAIL SALON,

604
01:03:12,137 --> 01:03:15,222
- CAN YOU BELIEVE?
- YEAH, I CAN.

605
01:03:15,223 --> 01:03:18,909
LILA WAS SO NICE.
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

606
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,429
- (doorbell rings)
- OH, I SHOULD GET THAT.

607
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:24,966
- DAVID, CAN YOU POUR THEM
SOME WINE, PLEASE?
- OF COURSE.

608
01:03:31,673 --> 01:03:34,842
- OH, HI!
- HEY, LILA.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

609
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:37,778
- AND YOU MUST BE BETHANY.
- YES. HI.

610
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:39,347
NICE TO MEET YOU.

611
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,815
COME ON IN.

612
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:45,552
Lauren:
DAVID, THIS FOOD
IS INCREDIBLE.

613
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:47,071
YOU HAVE TO SHARE
THE RECIPE.

614
01:03:47,072 --> 01:03:49,090
DAVID IS AN
AMAZING COOK, ISN'T HE?

615
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:51,893
- EXCELLENT.
- DAVE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
OPEN A RESTAURANT.

616
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:53,627
(giggles)

617
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:55,663
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T LAUGH.

618
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,364
I JUST CAN'T SEE
YOU DOING THAT.

619
01:03:57,365 --> 01:03:59,834
HE LIKES TO WORK
FROM HOME.

620
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:03,337
WHAT KIND OF WORK
DO YOU DO, DAVID?

621
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:05,540
HE'S A WRITER.

622
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,441
OH YEAH?
WHAT KIND OF STUFF
DO YOU WRITE?

623
01:04:07,442 --> 01:04:10,278
Lila:
OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE SO SHY.

624
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:13,281
- IT'S REALLY JUST A HOBBY.
- HE'S WRITING A
CHILDREN'S BOOK.

625
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:16,116
REALLY?
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

626
01:04:16,117 --> 01:04:19,053
- IT'S ABOUT TWO LITTLE CHILDREN
LIVING IN THE WOODS.
- LILA.

627
01:04:19,054 --> 01:04:21,539
ONE DAY A CREATURE COMES

628
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,909
AND TELLS THEM ABOUT
THIS MAGICAL PLACE JUST
OUTSIDE OF THE FOREST

629
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,511
THAT HAS EVERYTHING
THEY COULD EVER DESIRE.

630
01:04:27,512 --> 01:04:29,546
HE TELLS THEM THAT
HE'LL TAKE THEM THERE

631
01:04:29,547 --> 01:04:33,133
ON ONE CONDITION:
THAT THEY CAN NEVER
GO BACK TO THEIR HOME.

632
01:04:33,134 --> 01:04:37,405
SO THE CHILDREN FOLLOW
THE CREATURE ALL THE WAY
DEEP INTO THE WOODS,

633
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:40,141
BUT HE'S RUNNING
SO FAST THAT THEY
CAN'T KEEP UP.

634
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,809
HE LEAVES THEM
LOST AND ALL ALONE.

635
01:04:46,731 --> 01:04:48,716
I ASKED YOU
NOT TO TELL IT.

636
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:52,753
BUT IT'S SO GOOD.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ASHAMED.

637
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:03,380
DAVID.  DAVID?

638
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:08,603
DAVID.
IS THAT HOW IT ENDS, DAVID?

639
01:05:10,772 --> 01:05:12,506
IS IT?

640
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:17,178
THEY CAN'T EXACTLY
FALL IN LOVE BECAUSE
THEY'RE BROTHER AND SISTER.

641
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,063
THAT IS WHAT YOU WROTE, HM?

642
01:05:25,237 --> 01:05:27,238
TWINS?

643
01:05:33,412 --> 01:05:36,380
OH, NONE FOR ME, THANKS.
I'M DRIVING.

644
01:05:36,381 --> 01:05:38,949
MAYBE ONCE I GET TO KNOW
THE CITY A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

645
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,938
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE TO CHECK
ON MY FIANCÉE.

646
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,742
(women giggling)

647
01:05:48,743 --> 01:05:50,778
HONEY, IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE BIT LATE.

648
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:52,396
MAYBE WE SHOULD
HEAD HOME?

649
01:05:52,397 --> 01:05:53,914
OH, HONEY,
I'M HAVIN' FUN.

650
01:05:53,915 --> 01:05:55,950
(laughs)

651
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:57,785
SEE?  SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO LEAVE.

652
01:05:57,786 --> 01:06:00,370
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M A PARTY POOPER.

653
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:03,024
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M ON CALL TOMORROW.

654
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,159
UH, IT WAS
A LOVELY EVENING.

655
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,077
- (door opens)
- THANKS FOR HAVING US.

656
01:06:07,078 --> 01:06:09,113
GOOD NIGHT.

657
01:06:09,114 --> 01:06:11,232
(door closes)

658
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:14,202
Lila:
DAVID, COULD YOU POUR
SOME MORE WINE, PLEASE?

659
01:06:16,888 --> 01:06:18,905
THANK YOU, DAVID.

660
01:06:18,906 --> 01:06:21,125
NOW CAN YOU GO PUT ON
SOME MUSIC, PLEASE?

661
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:29,283
AH, THANK YOU.

662
01:06:37,175 --> 01:06:39,093
('80s music playing)

663
01:06:44,015 --> 01:06:47,285
WHAT WAS HER PROBLEM?
WASN'T EVERYTHING PERFECT?

664
01:06:47,286 --> 01:06:49,170
IT WAS.

665
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,972
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.

666
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:55,209
THANK YOU.

667
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,415
(giggles)

668
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:07,354
¶ Well, I thought
I heard you say ¶

669
01:07:07,355 --> 01:07:09,707
¶ And I know
I feel the rain... ¶

670
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:11,442
(glass clinks)

671
01:07:11,443 --> 01:07:13,744
¶ But I can't
give up looks ¶

672
01:07:13,745 --> 01:07:16,247
¶ Until it's away ¶

673
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:21,468
¶ Now I just
can't take ¶

674
01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:24,839
¶ The way to live
my life ¶

675
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:29,410
¶ Holding dear
my last breath in my lungs ¶

676
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:34,532
¶ I know
i'll see you again ¶

677
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:36,667
¶ See you again ¶

678
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:49,297
¶ Don't take my hand
'cause I take it away ¶

679
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:56,404
¶ And I take everything
just to take it away ¶

680
01:07:58,573 --> 01:08:03,210
¶ Well, you can't
give me problems ¶

681
01:08:03,211 --> 01:08:05,680
¶ You can't
give me signs ¶

682
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:10,100
¶ As easy as you give,
I can take it away ¶

683
01:08:13,054 --> 01:08:15,973
¶ Now I know
the things I say ¶

684
01:08:15,974 --> 01:08:19,609
¶ Don't hold up
in the rain ¶

685
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:24,281
¶ Every touch was a gift
straight from my heart... ¶

686
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:26,183
(music fades)

687
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,142
- (screaming)
- (slicing, thudding)

688
01:08:36,444 --> 01:08:38,462
- (screaming stops)
- (body thuds)

689
01:08:47,138 --> 01:08:48,706
(sighs)
ARE YOU ALMOST FINISHED?

690
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,374
ALMOST.

691
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,276
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE PERFECT.

692
01:08:52,277 --> 01:08:53,611
YES, IT DOES.

693
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:57,230
DAVID, WE HAVE
TO LEAVE TOMORROW.

694
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:01,569
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE
TO LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.

695
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,921
WHAT?

696
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:07,924
WE'VE BEEN CAREFUL.

697
01:09:07,925 --> 01:09:09,993
MAYBE WE CAN
STAY LONGER.

698
01:09:09,994 --> 01:09:11,979
(laughs)
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO THAT.

699
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:17,802
IF IT'S TOO RISKY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY.

700
01:09:19,871 --> 01:09:22,306
DAVID, WHERE IS THIS
COMING FROM?

701
01:09:22,307 --> 01:09:23,908
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

702
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:25,475
REALLY?

703
01:09:27,012 --> 01:09:29,496
JUST, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

704
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:36,087
YOU CAME
BACK TO ME TONIGHT.

705
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,938
I SAW IT.

706
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,142
YOU CAN COME UPSTAIRS
IF YOU WANT TO.

707
01:09:44,996 --> 01:09:46,914
WE CAN WATCH THE VIDEO.

708
01:09:56,324 --> 01:09:58,509
(water splashes)

709
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,228
(weeping)

710
01:10:53,982 --> 01:10:56,083
(sighs)

711
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,254
(shivering)

712
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,052
WHAT TIME IS IT?

713
01:11:37,174 --> 01:11:39,342
IT'S EARLY.

714
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,277
(sighs)
DAVID, WILL YOU
GO TO THE STORE?

715
01:11:57,278 --> 01:11:59,146
WE'RE OUT OF MILK.

716
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:03,784
DAVID.

717
01:12:03,785 --> 01:12:07,321
DID YOU HEAR ME?

718
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:10,374
WE RAN OUT OF MILK
AND I NEED SOME
FOR MY COFFEE.

719
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,676
OKAY.
I'LL GO TO THE STORE.

720
01:12:14,879 --> 01:12:16,913
I'M GONNA PACK.

721
01:12:16,914 --> 01:12:19,349
DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE
SANDWICHES FOR THE ROAD?

722
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,635
THAT'D BE NICE.

723
01:12:51,048 --> 01:12:53,768
- (scraping)
- (grunting)

724
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,273
(panting)

725
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:03,160
(knife clatters)

726
01:13:17,742 --> 01:13:19,643
(humming)

727
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:34,652
(Josh's voice
on film)

728
01:14:34,653 --> 01:14:36,954
Alice on film:
YOU'RE A DORK.

729
01:14:44,762 --> 01:14:46,830
(conversation
on film continues)

730
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:03,163
(flies buzzing)

731
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:49,576
HELLO?

732
01:15:50,762 --> 01:15:52,428
ALICE?

733
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,525
YOU BITCH!

734
01:16:05,526 --> 01:16:07,461
(Lila grunting)

735
01:16:27,181 --> 01:16:29,115

(loud thud)

738
01:17:13,945 --> 01:17:15,963
(breathing heavily)

739
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:22,269
(footsteps)

740
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,004
OH JESUS.

741
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:25,405
Oscar: ALICE?

742
01:17:25,406 --> 01:17:27,691
OH MY GOD.

743
01:17:27,692 --> 01:17:32,162
(stammering)
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

744
01:17:32,163 --> 01:17:34,631
- WHO'S COMING?
- HE'S COMING BACK.
JUST GET ME OUT.

745
01:17:34,632 --> 01:17:36,666
JUST GET ME OUT!

746
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:38,835
(stammering)
WHERE ARE THE KEYS?

747
01:17:38,836 --> 01:17:41,171
I DON'T KNOW.
GO IN THE GARAGE
AND GET SOME TOOLS.

748
01:17:41,172 --> 01:17:43,373
WAIT. THERE'S NO--
(stammering)

749
01:17:43,374 --> 01:17:45,742
GET THE TOOLBOX!
HE'S COMING!

750
01:17:45,743 --> 01:17:47,711
WHO'S COMING?!

751
01:17:51,216 --> 01:17:53,100
(rummaging loudly)

752
01:17:55,803 --> 01:17:57,770
JUST HOLD THE CHAIN.

753
01:18:03,144 --> 01:18:05,178
ALICE, I'M GONNA
CALL THE POLICE, OKAY?

754
01:18:05,179 --> 01:18:07,580
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS
AND CALL THE POLICE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

755
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:09,816
- COME BACK FOR ME.
- I WILL!  I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

756
01:18:10,918 --> 01:18:12,852
(rapid footsteps)

757
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:19,393
(gasping)

758
01:18:23,514 --> 01:18:24,981
(phone beeps)

759
01:18:24,982 --> 01:18:27,183
9-1-1.
What is your emergency?

760
01:18:31,256 --> 01:18:33,473
JUST NEED--
YOU NEED TO HURRY.
I CAN'T GET HER OUT!

761
01:18:33,474 --> 01:18:35,575
(Oscar cries out,
gurgles)

762
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,969
Sir, are you there?
Sir? The police are
on their way.

763
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:47,570
(rapid footsteps)

764
01:19:00,617 --> 01:19:01,952
ALICE!

765
01:19:01,953 --> 01:19:03,754
STAY BACK, DAVID,
OR I SWEAR I'LL KILL HER.

766
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:06,973
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'LL CUT HER GODDAMN THROAT!

767
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,231
THROW ME THE KEYS, DAVID.

768
01:19:18,102 --> 01:19:21,771
THROW ME
THE FUCKING KEYS, DAVID!

769
01:19:24,575 --> 01:19:26,676
I'M GONNA KILL HER, DAVID.

770
01:19:26,677 --> 01:19:28,478
I'M GONNA SLIT
HER FUCKIN' THROAT.

771
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:38,488
IF YOU KILL HER,
WE CAN GO.

772
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:47,647
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?
I SAID I'LL KILL HER.

773
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:56,206
IT'S OKAY.

774
01:20:00,344 --> 01:20:02,512
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
WE'LL BE TOGETHER.

775
01:20:07,018 --> 01:20:08,785
HERE.

776
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:17,160
JUST CUT.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

777
01:20:26,537 --> 01:20:29,706
GOODBYE, LILA.

778
01:20:29,707 --> 01:20:31,808
DAVID?

779
01:20:34,028 --> 01:20:36,129
- (Alice cries out)
- ALICE!

780
01:20:39,767 --> 01:20:42,352
- ALICE.
- (gasping)

781
01:21:11,632 --> 01:21:14,600
(gasping, wheezing)

782
01:21:32,503 --> 01:21:34,838
(coughing)

783
01:21:35,906 --> 01:21:37,941
WHAT'D YOU THINK, DAVID?

784
01:21:37,942 --> 01:21:40,693
THAT SHE REALLY LOVED YOU?

785
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:49,402
NO ONE'LL EVER
LOVE YOU EXCEPT ME.

786
01:21:56,961 --> 01:21:59,796
WE HAVE TO GO NOW,
DAVID.

787
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,084
COME ON.
WE NEED TO GO.

blaring)

01:23:11,669 --> 01:23:14,621
IT WAS BUILT IN 1952--
SO MID-CENTURY MODERN.

792
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,157
THESE WINDOWS
ARE ALL ORIGINAL

793
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:20,343
AND THEY REALLY DO ALLOW
THE HOUSE JUST TO BE
FILLED WITH LIGHT.

794
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:25,081
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

795
01:23:29,253 --> 01:23:31,538
I LOVE IT.
IT'S HOME.
