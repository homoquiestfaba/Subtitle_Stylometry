00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,661
a girls' time when
you're out of town.

355
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,859
And why wouldn't they,
you know?

356
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,526
You don't expect things like...

357
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,867
You know, she's spread eagle on
the floor, banging the mailman.

358
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,635
"Special delivery!"

359
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,040
Not on our bed!

360
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,702
(SOBS) You dirty bird!

361
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,508
In front of the dog!
Is he serious?

362
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,742
Oh, the dog's so upset!

363
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,784
I mean, you know,

364
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,650
you're at a security
convention in Albuquerque

365
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,350

your lungs at a Quality Inn!

367

You can't scratch your way
through the camera!

00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,827
Kinda reminds me,
I gotta mail out some bills

369
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,020
before the end of the month.

370
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,293
Uh, it's okay, man.
It's okay.

371
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,667
Bobby, you better not
be recording.

372
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,391
Uh, Bobby? Yeah, I
got the whole thing.

373
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,428
Don't do this shit in my house.

It's okay. Okay.
All right. I understand.

00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,669
(CRYING CONTINUES) Okay.

377
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,021
Why are you installing all
these security cameras anyway?

378
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,409
Uh, we may have a burglar.

379
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,542
Or a ghost.

380
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,778
A burglar.
Ghost.

381
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,979
Burglar.
Ghost!

382
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,614
Well, it just so happens I have
my own ghost hunter reality show.

383

what it's called?

384
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,521

It is trademarked, so don't
get any funny ideas.

389
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,864
I definitely won't.
All right. See ya.

390
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,060
Yeah! You know they're

KISHA:
Malcolm, what is that?

393
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,841
Well, I paid those
camera guys all this money

394
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,574
and they left a big-ass
blind spot inside the hallway.

395
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:54,446
So you decided to break my fan and
rig up this ridiculous camera?

396
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,879
Yep.

397
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,485

00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,615

I haven't seen
no parts of the vagina.

moved out the same day.

Not as angry as
it makes my penis.

Well, I am angry
for your penis.

something you can do

Oh, yeah.

What?

469
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,219
Well, you know how, like,

470
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,025
if you get tired
of driving your car,

471
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,565
you might
test-drive a new car?

472
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,622
Mm-hmm.

473
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,258
Maybe you would
even let somebody else

474
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,736
drive your car for a
little while, you know?

475
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,830
Get a whole new appreciation of
your vehicle when you do that.

00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,852
You would never do it?

483
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,822
I would absolutely never do it.

484
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,358
Me neither.
Me neither.

485
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,427
What kind of pervert does that?

486
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,621
That's what you
would have to be.

487
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,254
It takes a pervert
to swap girlfriends.

488
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,560
You never have done it,
and you never would, huh?

489
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,658
No, Steve.

490
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,465
Even if you got drunk enough
or something like that?

491
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,369
Like, you might have a few
too many drinks and say,

492
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,639
"Why not?
Let's give it a try,"

493
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,132
if there was a couple
that was into it.

494
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,574
No.
No. Yeah, me neither.

495
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,634
That's how I feel.

496
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,078
But even, like, maybe
if you got a little high,

497
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,945
maybe on a Saturday night
or something like that,

498
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,348
and you were like...

499
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,510
(STAMMERS) Even then.

500
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,111
Yeah. Like, even if
this couple was, like,

501
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,180
up for anything
and raring to go,

502
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:56,284
and she was hot to trot,
like, a hot, hot lady.

503
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,591
It wouldn't matter.
You wouldn't do it, right?

504
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,962
Nigger, no.

505
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,627
Same here.
We're in agreement.

506
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,364
It's crazy to swap
girlfriends like that.

507
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,463
I am with you 100%.

508
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,072
Steve, want a beer?

509
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,270
Thank you very much.

510
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,007
Hey, babe, did you
tell Steve we have a ghost?

511
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,138
We don't have a ghost.
A ghost?

512
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,774
Yeah.
Awesome.

513
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,942

cool to have a ghost.

We don't have a ghost.

517
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,547
You thought it
was cool in college.

518
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,284
We did a seance and everything!

519
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,224
A seance?
Oh, yeah. That's right.

520
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,317
You did a seance?

521
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,885
Yes.
Honey, it's college.

522
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,118

Yeah.

got drunk and made out.

Oh, it's all hazy.

526
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,731

it's like a big fog.

527
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,396
MALCOLM: We're gonna talk
about these college days.

528
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,495
Yeah, yeah.

529
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,701
A hazy, sexy fog,
it sounds like.

530
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,335
Wouldn't it be great if we all
spent the night? Together?

531
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,470
Well, that's an
interesting idea.

532
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,741
What do you think
of that, Malcolm?

533
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,543
A naked sleepover?
MALCOLM: No.

534
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,878
No?
It's weird.

535
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,350
Yeah, but it's definitely
gonna be weird.

536
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,887
But are you saying
weird good or weird bad?

537
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,149
Weird bad, Steve.

538
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,349
Okay.

539
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,549
All right, you guys.
It's been real.

540
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,527
Listen, I know a great
psychic if you need one.

541
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,620
Okay.

542
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,891
He told me I'd be surrounded

543
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,594
by big, black spirits
in my near future.

544
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,863
Vaginas crossed.

545
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,372
MALCOLM: Yeah, okay.
Right? Goodbye!

546
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,168
(LAUGHS) Well.

547
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,403
Listen, before we go, I just wanna
talk to you about something,

548
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,910
'cause Jenny's got
a birthday coming up.

549
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,002
Okay.

550
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,775
I wanna do something real
special for her, you know.

551
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,043
I was thinking maybe you could
invite a couple of guys over,

552
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,710
Like your cousin Ray-Ray,
maybe?

553
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,878
And some of
those big, black guys

554
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,444
that he hangs out with,
you know?

555
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,887
Jamal, and Hakim,
and Anforny, you know?

556
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,927
Just the six of us, right?
We'll have some fun.

557
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,019
We'll double stuff
the Oreo a little bit, huh?

558
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,796
Dirty up the white snow?

559
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,365
Black poles, white holes.

560
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,266
You know, maybe all pile on the
little white rabbit, right, you know?

561
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,599
Are you talking
about a mandingo party?

562
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,468
What? A what?

563
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,302
Excuse me!

564
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,572
I mean, I'm really, uh, not into that.
But if you're into that...

565
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,771
Um, I'm...

566
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,438
Well, we might be able
to work something out

567
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,537
if that's what you're into.

568
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,277
Hey, buddy, I mean...
Okay, bye, Steve.

569
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,508
Oh!

570
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,177
MALCOLM: Oh, wow.

571
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,411
That's beautiful.
Okay, Jenny.

572
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,512
All right. Goodbye.

573
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,988
Okay, honey, come on.
Come on, honey, come in.

574
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,820
You're lucky.

575
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,257
She is luckier.

576
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,989
Bye, guys. Bye!
All right.

577
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,964
(LAUGHS) Okay. All right.

578
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,991
KISHA: I think Jenny and
Steve are swingers.

579
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,592
MALCOLM:
You think? Wow.

580
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,262
This looks like
a ghetto Rite Aid.

581
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,567
Wrong Aid.

582
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,904
Oh, shit!
Did somebody shave a yeti?

583
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,840
KISHA: Very funny.
I shaved my legs.

584
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,572
With what, a weed whacker?

585
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,080
Wow. That's like
Apollo Creed's chest hairs.

586
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,172
That is crazy.

587
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,047
Oh! Hey!
Malcolm, come on!

588
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,485
Dude, turn that off.
Get out of here.

589
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,078
You got to close this.
Stop it!

590
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,680
I'm claustrophobic, okay?

591
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,315
Yeah? Well,
I'm ass-trophobic.

592
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,916
You know what, Malcolm?
What?

593
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,519
Love it or leave it, okay?
Here. Here.

594
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,324
(LOUD GROANING) Take it, okay?

595
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,898
It's oak-y.
(MALCOLM LAUGHING)

596
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,094
It's... It's full-bodied.

597
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:52,961
I believe it's open.

598
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,130
Oh, that's...
That's nasty!

599
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,673
Mmm. The aroma.

600
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,866
The nastiest thing ever.

601
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,102
No, Malcolm! Malcolm!

602
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,643
Hey! No!

603
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,372
Move your little nasty foot.
Stop it!

604
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,411
Ow! Ow! Malcolm!

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,655
Uh, Malcolm. Malcolm?
Hmm?

607
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,166
The camera isn't off.

608
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,328
Yeah, the camera's off.
What are you talkin' about?

609
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,530
The light is on.

610
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,697
That's the standby light.

611
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,671
That's the record light.

612
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,902
I don't want to be
like those stupid girls.

613
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,309
Kim Kardashian with a sex tape.

614
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,075
First of all, Kim Kardashian's
worth $150 million.

615
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,509
Think about it, Kisha. You could
have your own reality show.

616
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,213
You could have your own clothing
line, your own perfume.

617
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,880
"Stank," by Kisha.

618
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,150
No.

619
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,658
Your window of opportunity
is closing quickly.

620
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,921
Turn it off.

621
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,121
Oh, God, you are a hater.

622
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,561
I'm not.

623
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,398
Malcolm. You ain't slick.
That camera's still on.

624
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,530
What?
(MIMICS) "What?"

625
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,106
(GRUNTS) That's cheap.

(VIDEOTAPE FAST-FORWARDING)

(YELPS) Whoo! Whoo!

628
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,872
(GRUNTS) Don't touch it.

629
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,508
Don't touch it.
That was crazy.

630
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,711
Oh, I got a cramp.

631
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,220
I told you we should
have recorded that.

632
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,223
I don't think they
make 30-second tapes.

633
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,421
Oh, come on. That was at least
two minutes, 15, 16 seconds.

634
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,018
Whoo! That was great.

635
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,859
Malcolm, you know
we have to go again, right?

636
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,231
(GRUNTS) I need a halftime.
You gotta talk to the coach.

637
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,599
Get some new plays.

638
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,093
(SNORING)

639
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,908
Wake up.
Okay, okay.

640
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,999
Come on now.

641
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,202
Okay, okay.

Yeah.

644
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,142
Good morning, honey.

to turn the camera off!

I know. I'm shit.

649
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,420
But, baby, I was tearin'
it up last night. (WHOOPS)

650
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,698
Oh, please.
You were all right.

651
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,060
Baby, check this move.
Look at that.

652
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,653
Malcolm, I need you
to erase this tape.

653
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,566
I don't wanna end
up on the Internet.

656
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,602
Okay.

657
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,608
Did you see that?
Uh-huh.

658
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,997
See, I call that move
the Tornado.

659
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,406
No, stupid!

660
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,642
Look! The door, it moved.
You see?

661
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,046
MALCOLM: Oh, wow.

662
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,384
Well, there is a rational
explanation for all that.

663
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,649
See, what happens is,
with the Tornado, right,

664
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,452
the vortex in
which I move my hips,

665
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,084
especially with
a downward motion,

666
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,923
it creates that vortex.

667
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,293
I'm surprised the windows
didn't blow open.

00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,195

Sometimes it does that.

disaster theme for me and you.

the Mudslide tonight.

there, fast as I can. I just shake.

Malcolm, come here, please!

677
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,490
Quick! What happened?
What happened?

678
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,388
Okay, so the glass was on
the counter, and then it...

679
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,724
Something knocked it off!

680
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,196
How do you explain that?

681
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,728
Well, maybe you put it
on the edge of the counter,

682
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,825
and it just slipped off.

683
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,365
Last night,
it was the door, Malcolm.

684
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,669
And then, this morning,
the pot was on the floor.

685
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,002
Maybe it wasn't put
on the rack properly.

686
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,842
All right, I'll take credit for that.
Lord knows you don't cook.

Oh, I love you, but stop.
Be careful.

glass in your foot

all through the house

me now, Malcolm? Hmm?

Maybe it was your vortex.

really moving.

he'd work the clay and just...

822
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,733
(SPITS) And he just
fuckin' has it, and...

823
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,305
Demons, though, are bad.

824
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,532
Those are pure,
pure, pure evil.

825
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,841
And they will pop up
at the worst possible times.

826
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,938

827
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,650

829

All I'm saying is,
do not aggravate a demon.

830
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,794
Do not try to contact them,

831
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,195
and whatever you do,
do not film them.

832
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,763
That will only
make things worse.

833
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,995
See? Don't film demons.

834
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,866
Very bad.
Okay.

835

for coming out, man.

wanna get off your chest?

No, I'm good.

want to put on my chest?

the clay scene.

Wait, wait. Uh...

I knew it.

Oh! Ick!
No, I don't!

844
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,015
But did I mention that I made
a deal with the devil

845
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,060
for a pair of
really cool Louboutins?

846
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,891
You made a deal with the
devil for a pair of shoes?

847
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,932
Not shoes, Malcolm!
Louboutins, okay?

848
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,333
They've got red soles,
and they make my calves pop!

(GROWLS)

850
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,840
Well, I really
needed them, okay?

851

This demon is not leaving this
house until it gets what it wants.

854
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,347
What's that?

855
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,910
Kisha.

856
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,788
You're fine, Malcolm.

857
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,155
Like, you're free to
be whoever you want.

858
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,484
It's a five-man
wrestling league.

859
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,550
I'm good.

860
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,653
It's so fun.

861
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,851
I bet it is.
It's not for me.

862
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,229
And everyone's really good.
Really?

863
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,561
Yeah, no, but it's competitive.

864
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,295
It's something that...

865
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,534
Oh, my God.
I'm getting mind powers.

866
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,596
Okay. All right.
I'm getting mind powers.

is going to happen to you

868

that is going to change you.

869
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,742
Don't fight it.

870
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,258
Whatever it is,
don't fight it, okay?

871
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,310
Okay, I won't. I won't.
I can save you.

872
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,117
It's five guys.
We wrestle on Monday.

873
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,247
Okay.

874
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,087

01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,316
Kisha. Oh, boy. Kisha!

1558
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,850
Kisha? Baby?

1559
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:15,514
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
for the way I been acting.

1560
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,922
I just want to tell
you that I love you,

1561
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,518
and I don't want anything
to come between us.

1562
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:22,655
And what the hell is that
Twilight shit on your neck?

1563
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:25,561

Oh, my God! Oh, God!

1564
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,367
What the hell?
(PANTING)

1565
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,035
Oh, yeah.
She is definitely on the rag.

1566
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,462
MALCOLM: Oh, Father.
Thank God you could make it.

1567
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,838
Nigger, call me "Doug."

1568
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,937
I don't like being
called "Father." No way.

1569
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,609
Plus, I got a couple issues
with a few people out there

1570
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,549
claiming false child support.

1571
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,883
I mean, just 'cause the
little nigger got my eyes,

1572
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,855
my nose, my extremely rare
AB-negative blood type,

1573
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,755
don't mean I'm the damn daddy.

1574
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,555
Plus, I'm still in training.

1575
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,130
At the seminary?

1576
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:56,731
No, the penitentiary.

1577
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,357
What?
Shit, nigger,

1578
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,129
I've been
incarcerated 15 years.

1579
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,667
Oh. But you learn a lot out
there reading on the yard.

1580
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,400
You shank a nigger, come
in, read the scripture.

1581
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,738
Shank a motherfucker,
read the scripture.

1582
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,165
You gonna let
a nigger in or what?

1583
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,412
Uh, I'm sorry, Father.
Come in.

1584
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,674
Damn. Standing out here, nigger.
It's cold as hell.

1585
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:16,911
Ooh.

1586
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,345
Uh, bro, I'm gonna have
to level with you.

1587
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,323
This bitch don't look right.

1588
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:26,259
I mean, she look all
ashy and shit, and just...

1589
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,728
You know, like E.T.
with a weave.

1590
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,230
If I was you, I'd just be out.

1591
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,891
Let's just go.
Come on. Let's go.

1592
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,333
Uh, I... I can't leave her.
That's my girl.

1593
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:35,870
Are you kidding me?
Come on, man.

1594
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,337
There's so much
pussy in the world, man.

1595
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,998
You don't have to
be with just her.

1596
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,201
Come to the congregation.

1597
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,210
I've got a few in
the congregation,

1598
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,870
I'm trying to tell you.
Check this out.

1601
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,878
Now, I know she look old.

1602
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:51,044
I know she... But she a
freak, and she got skills.

there and just save her?

1604

Yo! Yo, dawg, you yelling
at me right now?

1605
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,453
I know you just
didn't scream on me, dawg.

1606
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,051
I'm here to
exorcise your bitch, man.

1607
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,359
So you wanna go in the room.
All the way in?

1608
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,030
Look at her hair.
Her hair's all crazy.

1609
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,570
You think I'm scared
right now, but I'm not.

1610
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:09,696
I didn't think you was scared.

1611
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,205
No, I'm just a little concerned

1612
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:13,435
that I don't have
the right stuff.

1613
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,271
Do you have,
like, a loaded gun?

1614
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:16,644

I'm here to
un-possess you.

She's on that <i>Bus A Bus.</i>

1634

Tic-tac-toe on your arm,
connect the cuts.

1640

That's what she was saying,
"Connect the cuts."

01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,948
I wanna show you something.

It's okay.
I'm gonna show you mine.

1645

Check this out. I did a little
something a while back.

1646
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:53,070
I did that in prison.
Yeah, you know,

1647
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,176
it hurt. But, you know,

1648

you gotta go through it.
You gotta earn it.

"No, you didn't!
You so hard, dawg!"

Sure. Of course.

Well, you know, if I can be
perfectly honest with you,

1660
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,004
it's your
technique that's sloppy.

This is going be
very unsettling.

"I saw my dead nana" scary,

of meth in the glove box

pulled up by the cops

1723
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:04,365
What is this supposed to do?

1724
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:10,400
Um... Nothing. I was just trying
to see how far you would go.

1725
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,529
What did I tell you?

1726
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,632
I think she looks fine.

1727
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:14,903
Clearly does not look fine.

1728
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,968
She looks fucked up.
I'm gonna need my Bible.

1729

You're gonna bless her?

1730
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,172
Well, yeah, I blessed this joint.
Mm-hmm.

1731
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,774
Right out of the First Chronicles.
(CHUCKLES)

1732
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:28,049
I haven't done many exorcisms, but
I don't think that's appropriate.

1733
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:32,456
I get it, I get it. I can fix
that, though, right now.

1734

Is there just one demon?

1740
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,033
'Cause I feel like we could
exorcise any demons in the area.

1741
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,168
What? I'll take on
a whole team of demons.

1742
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,576
What we should do is get
all the demons in one room

1743
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:51,670
and get rid of them
all at once.

1744
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,214
Do a collective
demon-gathering.

1745
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:54,741
We just walk up
to people's doors,

1746
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:55,875
"How you doing?
How you doing?"

1747
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,077
"Can we talk to you
about the Lord today?"

1748
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,881
"We heard y'all got demons up in there.
What's up?"

1749
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:00,114
Can I get in
the bed with your girl?

1750
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:03,056
I used to braid hair. I could
actually braid her hair right now.

1751
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,386
I'll be hitting her with some
Allen Iversons and stuff.

1752
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,155
I'll give her some Sprewells.
I'll take it back.

1753
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:11,032
Let's do a little exorcism.

1754
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,531
All right, "Blessed is he

1755

charity and goodwill,

shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness."

1757

"For he is truly
his brother's keeper

1758
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,115
and the finder
of lost children."

"And you will know
my name is the Lord

1760
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:36,319
when I lay my
vengeance upon you!"

1761
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,789
Did you just quote
Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction?

1762

Plus, on the plane movie.

When he was on the plane
and he killed the snakes.

1768

That's my favorite movie.

come out and holler at a brother.
