1
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:27,575
At ease.

2
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:31,744
Your name?

3
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,582
David Ackerman.

4
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:38,882
-How long have you been on the force?
-Two years, sir.

5
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:42,315
-Speak up, Ackerman.
-Sir, two years.

6
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,685
You applied for detective
in Burglary, Auto Theft division.

7
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:49,491
Most of the young hotshots were
lining up for Robbery or Homicide.

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,329
Sir, I figured there would be more
openings in Burglary, Auto Theft...

9
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:57,940
-...and I love chasing G-rides, sir.
-G-rides, Ackerman?

10
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,571
I'm sorry, sir.
Grand-theft auto.

11
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,778
Tell me something, Ackerman.

12
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,782
-Why do you want to be on the police force?
-Because I want to help people, sir.

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,578
That's a lie, isn't it?

14
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:18,851
-Do you have any siblings, officer?
-No.

15
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:20,893
That's another lie, isn't it?

16
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,429
<i>Jump, Joey, jump!</i>

17
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:25,758
<i>-You had a brother, didn't you?
-Jump, Joey, jump!</i>

18
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:29,632
l-- l was--
I was just a kid.

19
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:32,434
<i>-Jump!
-You murdered your own brother.</i>

20
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,038
It wasn't my fault.

21
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,303
Come on, jump.
Jump!

22
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,039
<i>Come on, Joey.
Jump it!</i>

23
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,143
<i>David!</i>

24
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,479
-You murdered your own brother.
-You murdered your brother.

25
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:48,055
You murdered your own brother.

26
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,288
David, are you okay?

27
00:01:56,266 --> 00:02:00,760
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

28
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:06,672
I'm a little tense
about the exam tomorrow.

29
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:10,146
Why are you doing this to yourself?

30
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,833
All right.
Welcome aboard.

31
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,881
Good job. Go on.
Get out of here.

32
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,053
Thanks.

33
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,410
-Let's get rolling, man.
-Why the hell not?

34
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,990
You got a light?

35
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:52,760
There must be 1 00 good reasons
why you shouldn't smoke those things.

36
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,631
But right now,
I can't think of one.

37
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,247
Damn.

38
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:11,278
Feast your eyes on that.

39
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,714
Yeah, a real classic.

40
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,321
They don't make them
like that anymore.

41
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:26,059
Man, you got tachometers for eyes.
I was talking about the babe.

42
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,328
So was I.

43
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:46,052
-Morales is two minutes late.
-We're out of here.

44
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:49,191
<i>You shouldn't be getting
your hands dirty, ángel blanco.</i>

45
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,362
What, and miss out
on all the fun?

46
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:15,978
<i>-You're late, maricón.
-Not by my watch.</i>

47
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:20,213
-Get yourself a better one, Loco.
-Go on. Get the hell out of here.

48
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:24,487
Come on. Let's go!
Let's wrap this thing up.

49
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:42,470
After all these months
of working on this deal...

50
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,943
-Let's get moving, man.
-Take it easy.

51
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,377
Another couple of minutes
ain't gonna to kill you.

52
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,059
Police officers!
Get your hands up! Up!

53
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,375
A little early for Christmas shopping,
ain't it?

54
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:20,573
-Who's up front in the cab?
-Santa Claus.

55
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:26,343
And "m the tooth fairy.
Try again.

56
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:30,492
No one, man.
There's nobody here but us.

57
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,361
Nobody here, Nick!

58
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:18,305
Surprise.

59
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,363
Oh, no.

60
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,136
Oh, no, man.

61
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:41,483
Motherfucker.

62
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,796
Son of a bitch.

63
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,129
Motherfucker.

64
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,207
Jesus Christ!
Who is this insane motherfucker?

65
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,364
Later, you fucker!

66
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,678
-ls he all right?
-Anybody else in there?

67
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,844
Anybody else in the car?

68
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:19,099
-You need any help?
-You got a light?

69
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,041
-Powell was a good man. Tough break.
-Yeah.

70
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,650
Good to see you
back on your feet.

71
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:42,452
Hey, Nick. Sorry to hear
about Powell, man.

72
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,956
-Ray.
-Nick, good to see you up and around.

73
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:55,729
I've looked at the files.
Both those guys on the trailer are in it.

74
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:59,772
That one fella, Ken Blackwell,
an ex-ClA pilot that's gone sour...

75
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,672
...has about 300 drug flights
across the border.

76
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,837
And Loco Martinez has eight counts
of grand-theft auto.

77
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:11,351
Shut up, Nick. You don't waste any time
on polite conversation, do you, Nick?

78
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:16,183
That's what I like about you.
Either way, it don't matter anymore.

79
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:20,328
-What don't matter?
-The Strom case.

80
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:23,590
Because you're being taken off it.
Homicide's taking over.

81
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,797
Homicide?

82
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:30,234
Ray, you know the only way to get to Strom
is to pin him to chop-shop operations.

83
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,169
But Homicide's just gonna--

84
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,342
Look, kid. This is a private
conversation here.

85
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:42,451
-Nick, this is David Ackerman.
-Hello, David. Pleasure meeting you.

86
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,988
-Nick, that was your new partner.
-You're kidding me.

87
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,520
Let him back in, Nick, now.

88
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,859
Don't mind Pulovski. He's an asshole,
but you'll get used to him after a while.

89
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:05,133
-Flattery will get you nowhere.
-Listen, Nick.

90
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:09,505
I went over Ackerman's test scores
and records. The kid's perfect.

91
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,977
Then how come his badge
is on upside down?

92
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:28,658
Kid, it looks like you forgot to dry off
behind your ears this morning.

93
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,629
Nick, be gentle.
Some of these virgins cry rivers.

94
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,430
You've met Cheech and Chong.

95
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:26,113
-What the hel"s going on?
-You'll find out as we go.

96
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,856
You mind letting me in
from the dark here?

97
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,228
The Jesse James look is out.
Why don't you holster that thing.

98
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:44,031
In fact, why don't you get a shoulder holster.
You don't want to go around halfcocked.

99
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:48,341
Another thing, kid.
You gotta change the way you dress.

100
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,469
You look like an old fuck.
After all, we're working undercover.

101
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:56,106
You gotta dress youthful and hip.
Wear what you usually wear.

102
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:58,719
This is what I usually wear.

103
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,081
Do you have a reservation?

104
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,357
I see. Right this way,
gentlemen.

105
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:11,155
-So that's what those things are for.
-l never go to lunch without it.

106
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:15,928
-l wonder why you're not covering me.
-My people are cool, man.

107
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:18,368
Don't I know you
from somewhere?

108
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,144
I'm sure you're mistaking me
for someone else.

109
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,176
Well, there's no mistaking this German beer.
It leaves a little aftertaste.

110
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:40,051
-What the hell is that all about?
-Just a man with a poor taste in beers.

111
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,527
<i>Hey, garçon, you got a light?</i>

112
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,303
I'm sorry, sir.
No smoking here.

113
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:56,005
Mr. Ackerman? lt's been so long.
I almost didn't recognize you.

114
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:58,578
-How are you, George?
-Fine. This is a surprise.

115
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:01,011
I will get you an ashtray.

116
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:05,815
What's the deal here?
You used to work here or something?

117
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,649
Not exactly.

118
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,457
You'll find out as we go.

119
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,856
Don't jerk me off, Strom.
I don't like it.

120
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:19,091
You got problems? Fine,
but my people want their money.

121
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:23,034
<i>l don't get it for them, then
I got fucking problems, capisce?</i>

122
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:29,144
I just lost a major payload,
but my principal shops are still running.

123
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,506
By next Friday,
you'll have your money.

124
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,590
Well, you're so popular around here,
why don't you order for both of us.

125
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:48,419
-Do you want the best?
-Why not?

126
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:51,589
Oysters Rockefeller
and prime rib.

127
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:58,304
And we'll have a bottle of that
fancy French champagne too.

128
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:02,138
No, forget it.

129
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:08,071
l don't know if you're who
I think you are, but if you are...

130
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,581
...l want you to have this.

131
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:25,160
-Excuse me, sir. What about your meal?
-They'll eat it.

132
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:43,884
-You ever worked East L.A. before, kid?
-"ve never been to East L.A.

133
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,221
Jesus, I wondered who
ate these damn things.

134
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,895
Listen.
At the hotel this morning...

135
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:07,667
We obviously weren't there for lunch.
Who was that guy?

136
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:12,973
Just a guy I ran into the other day.

137
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:18,977
-How'd you know he was going to be there?
-Because that's my job.

138
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:22,218
Well, that's great, you know.

139
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:25,519
I'm supposed to be your partner here.
What about my job?

140
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,995
What about it?

141
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,266
Want to know what a real criminal is,
Ackerman?

142
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:40,140
lt's the son of a bitch
who painted this car, that's who.

143
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,703
Yeah, that's what a real criminal is.

144
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,075
-Pulovski.
-Max.

145
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:48,511
What are you doing here?

146
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:52,517
Can you imagine defacing a work of art
like this with a color like that?

147
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,746
Guy ought to have
his ass removed.

148
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:58,359
l only been working here three weeks.
I don't need no trouble.

149
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,557
<i>Did you hear what that puto
said about my car?</i>

150
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,723
Put it back in your pants, Loco.

151
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:10,338
With the taste you beaners have,
he was being kind.

152
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,706
Son of a bitch!

153
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:18,209
I hear you been running
with a pretty fast crowd, Max.

154
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,282
I just dropped by to remind you
how short your legs really are.

155
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:25,045
Hey, I have not let you down.

156
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,680
I've been clean for over a year, so why
don't you stop looking over my shoulder.

157
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,801
Pretty fancy machinery around here, Max.
"m glad for you.

158
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:48,433
Anything less than kosher comes in,
you'll call, right?

159
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:53,244
-You know it, man.
-Good man.

160
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,799
David, where are you?

161
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,601
What are you talking about?
"m right here.

162
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:24,142
No, you're not.
You haven't been here in a long time.

163
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,742
I just got a lot of shit
on my mind these days.

164
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:38,658
Here you are
finishing law school...

165
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:44,390
...and "m a Burglary cop
in scenic downtown Los Angeles.

166
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,228
You know that doesn't matter to me.

167
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:53,367
Yeah, but I pick you up
after class...

168
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:58,104
...and I see you with all those
fucking together guys...

169
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,808
...with together lives,
and I just think sometimes...

170
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:05,509
...you're wasting your time
with me.

171
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:08,853
Don't make me feel like this.

172
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:12,960
I've always stood behind
every decision you've made.

173
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:16,361
I know that when there's
something wrong, you tell me.

174
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:20,792
But there's something going on
that you won't let me understand.

175
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:28,642
-l think something's gonna happen soon.
-What's gonna happen?

176
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,971
I don't know.

177
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:35,807
Something.

178
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:47,150
You know, "ve been chasing around
after you for days, sarge.

179
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:52,096
-What the hell are we doing here?
-This is where the fun starts.

180
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:08,978
Well...
Order yourself a drink, kid.

181
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,745
And watch your ass.
If you don't, somebody else will.

182
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,143
Excuse me.

183
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:40,313
Beer, please.

184
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:06,897
-Get that animal!
-Get him! Get him! Get him!

185
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,758
-What are you doing? You can't come here.
-Listen, Little Felix.

186
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:30,022
With your secondhand information,
I keep showing up late...

187
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:32,428
...and it's pissing me off,
you understand?

188
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,627
Now, you're going to give me the name
of that pigeon nesting up at Strom's...

189
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:41,435
...otherwise, you'll be in deep shit.
So much, you won't be able to see over it.

190
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:45,340
-You got that?
-l understand what you're saying, Pulovski...

191
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:48,812
...but if "m paid, I'll trade,
you know?

192
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:55,046
Thank you, Pulovski.

193
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:59,387
Thank you very much, man. I appreciate that.
You're all right in my book.

194
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:02,394
-You want some? I won't tell anybody.
-Knock it off.

195
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:20,105
That'll be 2 bucks.

196
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:24,478
Hey.

197
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,686
You tell your partner Loco was here.
You got that, boy?

198
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:32,884
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey!

199
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:55,345
This is a crackdown.

200
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:59,277
Get back. Get back.

201
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:05,521
Now, all you people driving without
auto insurance are hereby under arrest.

202
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:23,736
I didn't know you were
into group sex, kid.

203
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,215
You bastard!
Pulovski, you fucking bastard!

204
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,751
This shit is talcum powder, man!

205
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:36,721
You fucking double-crossing
gringo pig bastard!

206
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,153
Oh, man!

207
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:42,462
I'm crying.

208
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,204
What's wrong? Got a little gas, kid?
Too many of those candied doughnuts.

209
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:58,175
-They took my badge.
-Well, fill out a report and get another one.

210
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:11,952
All right, "m going in here.
See if you can back me up.

211
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,500
God!

212
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:03,799
Hey! What are you doing?

213
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:08,748
Hey, you son of a bitch!
What the--?

214
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:12,809
You son of a bitch!
What are you doing?

215
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,990
Put me down, man!
"m talking to you!

216
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:21,988
Put me down!

217
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,137
What the fuck are you doing?

218
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,867
I'm the cop that's footing your bills,
that's what.

219
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:38,035
So you and me are gonna make
a little arrangement.

220
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:41,948
No way, man.
I don't deal direct with pigs.

221
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:45,514
No!

222
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:52,524
Put me down, man.
Put me down!

223
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,763
Hey, no!

224
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:39,034
Shit!

225
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:28,951
-Jesus! My fucking beautiful Beemer.
-You listen real close, asshole.

226
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:31,921
I got enough to put you away
for a long vacation.

227
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:36,086
So like it or not, as of now
you're working for me, understand?

228
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,825
All right, all right. Anything you say.
Just put me down, all right?

229
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:48,867
All right.
Just put me down, right now!

230
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:06,221
Good. Good work, kid.
Now read them their rights.

231
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,540
Christ. What a dump.

232
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:25,709
You don't have to give it raves.
Here. Try that on for size.

233
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:30,215
-Cheers.
-You got suckered tonight, kid.

234
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:34,548
lt'll happen again, but eventually
you'll learn to be prepared.

235
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,885
You still race?

236
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:46,064
Only on the freeway.
You got a light?

237
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:50,970
-l don't smoke.
-l told you, you gotta be prepared.

238
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,609
-Fucking gas company.
-Looks like you won some races.

239
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,516
Mostly local stuff. Smalltime.

240
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:14,056
-Who's this, your wife?
-Ex.

241
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:21,734
-Don't tell me. She hated racing.
-She loved racing. She just hated me.

242
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,062
-You got someone, kid?
-Yeah, I do.

243
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,901
That's good.
Come on out back.

244
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:43,690
-Wow. '69 Norton?
-Yep.

245
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:45,257
Beautiful.

246
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,753
-'67 TR6 Triumph.
-You know your bikes, kid.

247
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:51,831
Very sweet.

248
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:57,203
I don't believe it.
You got a Deuce.

249
00:35:57,371 --> 00:36:00,534
Yeah, my pride and joy.
Pride and joy right here.

250
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:05,042
Let me show you my shop.
This is where I do all my tinkering around.

251
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:08,705
Oh, wow. A '48 FL.

252
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:13,244
Have a problem with this one.
Seems "m better at riding it...

253
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,549
...than I am at fixing it.
This son of a bitch don't run.

254
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,021
-Well, you got the key?
-Yeah.

255
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:28,596
-Thanks.
-Matches. How about that?

256
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:38,869
I told you so.

257
00:36:57,765 --> 00:37:01,929
How about that? Hey, you're pretty handy
to have around, kid.

258
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:05,698
Hell, I got a whole yard full of stuff
you can start in on next.

259
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,072
<i>I'm standing in front
of an East L.A. garage...</i>

260
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:17,843
<i>...which is the latest link in a chain
of six chop shops busted by the L.A.P.D...</i>

261
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:19,850
<i>...in the last three days.</i>

262
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:22,114
<i>This is Auto Theft Detective Nick Pulovski.</i>

263
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:26,920
<i>You seem to have gone out of your way
to ensure we were here for these raids.</i>

264
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:28,391
<i>Well, that's right, ma'am.</i>

265
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:32,692
<i>I realize that homicides and splashy robberies
get most of the headlines...</i>

266
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:35,893
<i>...but it's about time this crime
gets the attention it deserves.</i>

267
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,867
<i>It's impossible to make a real dent.</i>

268
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,975
<i>But it is possible to hurt individual assholes
who fuck it up for everyone.</i>

269
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:46,910
<i>Now, I happen to know of a prick that's
responsible for the whole fucking operation...</i>

270
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:50,949
<i>...and that son of bitch is hurting out there,
and I'm fucking liking it.</i>

271
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:52,949
<i>This is Connie Ling--</i>

272
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:01,755
We're going to be moving on again, Liesl.

273
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:11,093
But first I have to tie up a few loose ends.

274
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:25,243
Come on. It won't be so bad.

275
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:30,186
Sarah, if I die and go to hell,
it'll look just like my parents' house.

276
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:38,330
-Good evening, Lloyd.
-How you doing?

277
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:47,941
-Well, home sweet home.
-David.

278
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:49,098
Sarah.

279
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:53,178
-Mom. Nice to see you.
-Hello. Nice to see you too.

280
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:54,644
Happy birthday.

281
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:56,715
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

282
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:59,284
-You look gorgeous.
-So do you.

283
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:02,047
-Thank you.
-Are you having fun?

284
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:06,853
-What happened to your face?
-Just cop stuff, Mom.

285
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:09,596
-Just cop stuff?
-Yeah.

286
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,927
Okay-- Excuse me. Hello.

287
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,466
Happy birthday, Mom.

288
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:25,272
Good seeing you, David.

289
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,683
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

290
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,576
-Getting a little?
-Why?

291
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,015
Nick.

292
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:08,616
Hey, kid.

293
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:12,020
I didn't know we were on
a first-name basis, but how are you?

294
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:13,524
Not bad.

295
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:16,390
Are you here to arrest my mom
for substance abuse?

296
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:19,726
Very funny. Very funny.

297
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,767
I want to know what the hell
you're doing on the force.

298
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:24,632
You've got it made here.

299
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:28,400
Your uncle says you've almost got degrees
in engineering and economics.

300
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:33,445
-So I gotta hear this shit from you also?
-Hey, lighten up, kid. lt's just a party.

301
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:36,640
-Who invited you?
-l did, David.

302
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:42,421
My son doesn't talk
to us much, Mr. Pulovski.

303
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:47,089
If l hadn't seen you on the news,
I wouldn't have known who his partner was.

304
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:52,323
Let's take a walk.

305
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:58,701
You look like a man who likes
to get right to the point...

306
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,707
-...so I'll be very direct.
-Why the hell not? Got a light?

307
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:07,337
Always given David everything he wanted,
but lately he just won't take anything.

308
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:10,541
lt's as though he's cut me off completely.

309
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:15,253
David's just not cut out for this,
Mr. Pulovski. He's not cut out for it.

310
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:18,690
I thought we were gonna be direct.

311
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:22,288
Yeah, so did I.

312
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,397
I want to guarantee David's safety.

313
00:41:33,274 --> 00:41:35,265
Mr. Ackerman...

314
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:40,611
...if you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.

315
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:50,914
Hey, kid.

316
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,395
You tell your daddy next time
he needs a babysitter...

317
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:57,724
...tell him to check the yellow pages.

318
00:41:57,965 --> 00:41:59,830
lt's a lot cheaper.

319
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:13,203
Does he know he's not supposed
to smoke cigars in my house? David!

320
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:16,975
-Cigars are disgusting.
-l know. I know.

321
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:42,371
I guess we should get a cab, huh?

322
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:29,212
I see you're as adept at breaking into
houses as you are into cars, Morales.

323
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,849
You know me. I like to keep sharp.

324
00:44:35,222 --> 00:44:40,558
-You want to talk about something?
-lt's over, Morales. You're over.

325
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:44,654
What are you talking about?

326
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:49,892
I have no patience for any more shit.

327
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:57,969
That cop was learning too much too quickly.

328
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:03,549
You rely too much on a nonexistent
racial solidarity, Morales.

329
00:45:03,984 --> 00:45:06,214
Just a few ounces of the good stuff...

330
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:11,916
...and your friend Little Felix was singing to
me like a canary with his eyes plucked out.

331
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,425
No way.

332
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:19,757
I'm going to have to leave the country
if I ever want a breath of air.

333
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:24,698
Between the cops
and those fucking ltalians.

334
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:37,676
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

335
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:44,022
Come on, Strom.
How can you believe a guy like Felix?

336
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:55,928
Look, I gotta go.

337
00:46:06,547 --> 00:46:07,946
Come on.

338
00:46:08,582 --> 00:46:11,210
You took me for a ride.

339
00:46:11,385 --> 00:46:13,148
Now it's your turn.

340
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:17,417
Ciao.

341
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,813
The body is unidentified, Nick.

342
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:54,484
From the description, it sounds like the bird
you had nesting in the chop-shop operation.

343
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,827
That him, Nick?

344
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,907
Absolutely not. That ain't him.

345
00:47:21,955 --> 00:47:26,983
Your plastic's not gonna help you now,
you lousy little fuck.

346
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:32,028
We could get in a lot of hot water
for this.

347
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:35,691
Relax, kid. Take your mind off my work.

348
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:39,430
Think about that little squeeze you had
at your daddy's bash the other night.

349
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,631
Just shut up about her, all right?

350
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,102
Why don't we just get a court order.

351
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,477
They wouldn't give us one.
This ain't our case, remember?

352
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,845
Then why the hell are we here?

353
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:55,045
We both recognized Morales' body
at the junkyard.

354
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:57,850
-You fucking lied to Garcia.
-l didn't lie to him.

355
00:47:58,025 --> 00:48:02,257
-l just didn't tell him the truth.
-Oh, Christ. Don't patronize me.

356
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:06,626
Think l like dragging around after you all day?
I fucking hate it.

357
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,930
And I hate the way you drive,
and l hate your stinking whiskey breath.

358
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:14,870
Well, I hate your uptight, regulation-spouting,
Boy Scout horseshit.

359
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:18,072
And I hate the little fucking creases
in your pants.

360
00:48:18,245 --> 00:48:23,273
And I hate these fucking doughnuts.
These little ones with the pinky shit on top.

361
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,247
Nobody eats that shit.

362
00:48:25,419 --> 00:48:29,082
-Who the hell asked you anyways, huh?
-Shut up! I got him.

363
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:44,432
-Why do you want this guy so badly?
-He killed my partner.

364
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:47,267
I know about that,
but "m not buying it.

365
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:49,602
There's gotta be something else.

366
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:55,113
Listen, kid.

367
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,615
All my life, "ve been in a race,
whether it was on the circuit or the force.

368
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,252
I always seem to come up smalltime.

369
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:10,590
Except all of a sudden now, this guy Strom
falls right in my lap out of sheer luck.

370
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:16,669
Me and Powell, we make him as king of the
biggest chop-shop operation in the Southland.

371
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:18,930
I'm wearing him down. Do you hear me?

372
00:49:19,106 --> 00:49:22,371
He's running on reserve.
In fact, his engine's gonna blow...

373
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,510
...and I ain't gonna lose this one.

374
00:49:24,678 --> 00:49:29,581
You can either stand out of my way or
you can be my partner and back me up.

375
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,084
Goddamn this son of a bitch.

376
00:49:40,794 --> 00:49:42,989
Fuck this shit.

377
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:53,500
That's got it.

378
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:26,235
Wake up, kid.

379
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:28,874
We just hit the jackpot.

380
00:50:45,058 --> 00:50:48,494
Good to see you, Mr. Strom.
We really missed you.

381
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:51,424
Good luck on the tables tonight.

382
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:57,002
I stopped believing in luck a long time ago.

383
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,609
Mr. Strom.

384
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,124
<i>Now listen carefully, paesan.</i>

385
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:33,830
I am broke, desperate and very pissed.

386
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:39,494
I know you stupid wops
keep over $2 million in there.

387
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,740
You know the combination.

388
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,157
Everybody, come on out.

389
00:53:14,174 --> 00:53:19,009
All right. Up against the wall,
all of you. Come on.

390
00:53:21,514 --> 00:53:22,538
How did you know?

391
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:25,617
That's what happens when you live
with a bug up your ass.

392
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,083
You did good, Alphonse.
Now get out of here.

393
00:53:34,194 --> 00:53:36,719
Hold it right there.
That's far enough.

394
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:43,097
Shoot her.

395
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:48,565
Shoot her now.

396
00:53:51,378 --> 00:53:53,175
Freeze.

397
00:53:56,616 --> 00:53:58,641
Amateur.

398
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:05,151
Get the money.

399
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,559
-Ciao, pig.
-There's nothing in here.

400
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:16,228
What are we gonna do?

401
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:21,567
lmprovise.

402
00:54:51,104 --> 00:54:54,301
If you want him to die, shoot now.

403
00:54:56,476 --> 00:55:01,140
There's already one dead cop downstairs.
Don't make it two.

404
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:04,481
Hold your fire.
Don't shoot.

405
00:55:06,252 --> 00:55:09,016
We can't let you out of here.
You know that.

406
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:14,022
Of course. In five seconds,
"m pulling the trigger.

407
00:55:14,194 --> 00:55:15,889
Five.

408
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,962
Four.

409
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:19,996
Three.

410
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:22,498
-Two.
-Hold your fire.

411
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:25,103
Let them out of the building.

412
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,086
Now listen to me.

413
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:49,661
This pig has cheated me
out of $2 million in cash.

414
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:53,321
That's exactly what you will
have for me in 24 hours...

415
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,469
...if you ever want to see him alive again.

416
00:55:56,636 --> 00:55:59,503
Two million bucks?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

417
00:55:59,672 --> 00:56:02,197
That's not pertinent, is it?

418
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,343
I'm taking this car out of here.

419
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:07,105
I'm going to be flipping
through all your frequencies.

420
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:12,246
If I hear one static peep
about following us, the pig dies.

421
00:56:12,419 --> 00:56:16,583
Yeah, I hear you. How can we
be sure you won't kill him anyway?

422
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:18,553
You can't, can you?

423
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:36,030
Nick, goddamn it all to hell.

424
00:56:37,177 --> 00:56:38,872
-Freeze.
-Hold it.

425
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:40,845
Hold it!

426
00:56:57,697 --> 00:56:59,130
What do you mean, no money?

427
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:02,359
I mean the commissioner and the mayor...

428
00:57:02,535 --> 00:57:08,496
...decided not to set a precedent inviting
every maniac in this city to kidnap someone.

429
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:12,437
Whatever the hell we do, we're gonna
have to do it without $2 million.

430
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:17,174
-They'll kill him, goddamn it.
-Then they'll kill him.

431
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,585
He was gonna squeeze that trigger.
I saw it in his eyes.

432
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:25,986
They found the squad car ditched in
East L.A., captain. Bad guys are long gone.

433
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,221
You took it in the back, didn't you?

434
00:57:39,568 --> 00:57:42,503
They're not putting up the money.

435
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:44,502
Take a vacation.

436
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:46,836
Whatever happens...

437
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:51,336
...l don't want to see your face
for at least two weeks.

438
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:24,506
<i>Jump, Joey, jump.
Jump. Jump.</i>

439
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:30,946
Help me!

440
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:34,848
David, please. Help.

441
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:57,268
David.

442
00:58:58,581 --> 00:59:01,516
David? David?

443
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:04,412
What happened to you?

444
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,015
What's going on?

445
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:13,853
lt's time for me to stop being scared.

446
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:17,099
And for other people to start.

447
00:59:17,399 --> 00:59:19,094
I don't like this.

448
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:21,801
Well, nobody asked you to.

449
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,774
Just make sure you're there.

450
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,378
Take her down to the shop, Cruz.

451
00:59:49,732 --> 00:59:51,962
Well, cop...

452
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:57,265
...you wanted me so badly, now you get
to spend your last few hours of life with me.

453
00:59:57,606 --> 01:00:00,131
Well, that makes me feel warm all over.

454
01:00:00,676 --> 01:00:04,942
You know, "m curious about one thing.

455
01:00:05,114 --> 01:00:11,019
Why would a dumb Polack like you
think he could outsmart someone like me?

456
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:18,892
lt's just that the arrogant fucking Kraut
like you is in the firing line. That's--

457
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:21,253
Liesl.

458
01:00:22,264 --> 01:00:27,133
That's no way to treat $2 million
worth of merchandise.

459
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:32,971
Okay, Mr. Strom.
This place is completely rigged.

460
01:00:33,142 --> 01:00:35,770
Now, this little device
just works by sound.

461
01:00:35,945 --> 01:00:38,743
Punch in the sequence
anywhere from within 200 yards...

462
01:00:38,914 --> 01:00:42,111
...enter it, and ba-boom,
she's sky-high.

463
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:49,256
Well, it looks like I wasn't the one
who needed the longer legs, huh, Pulovski?

464
01:00:50,826 --> 01:00:54,990
I'm going to have to leave this place
real soon, thanks to you.

465
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:59,100
But when I go...

466
01:01:03,138 --> 01:01:05,663
...l go with a bang.

467
01:02:30,392 --> 01:02:32,917
I'm looking for Loco Martinez.

468
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:37,759
Why don't you run on home,
or you'll get hurt worse than before, faggot.

469
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:50,501
Shit!

470
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:21,260
Come on!

471
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:25,201
Who's next, huh?
You want a piece of me? Come on!

472
01:04:25,374 --> 01:04:27,808
Come on, motherfuckers!
Come on!

473
01:04:35,684 --> 01:04:38,744
Come on, motherfuckers!
Play fucking games?

474
01:04:39,221 --> 01:04:41,746
-Come on! Come on!
-No!

475
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:49,363
Come on!

476
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:51,863
You gonna fuck with me?

477
01:04:54,336 --> 01:04:57,066
Let's have a drink!
You fuckers thirsty, huh?

478
01:04:57,239 --> 01:04:58,331
Have a drink!

479
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:05,912
Come on! Come on, motherfuckers!
Come on!

480
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:11,542
Let's get hot.

481
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:24,426
You can't do this, man!
You're a cop! You're a fucking cop!

482
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,764
That's right. Tell me where I can find Loco
or I'll blow your brains out...

483
01:05:28,937 --> 01:05:32,395
-...and leave you here to burn.
-l don't know where Loco runs, man.

484
01:05:32,574 --> 01:05:35,702
-Bullshit!
-l swear on the Virgin, nobody knows!

485
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:39,975
-What about Little Felix?
-Third and Howard, man!

486
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:45,211
-He runs a cleaners at Third and Howard!
-Third and Howard, huh?

487
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:55,259
I never did pay you for that beer.

488
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,561
Come on!
This way! This way!

489
01:06:31,133 --> 01:06:35,695
I want the money
in a single black suitcase.

490
01:06:35,871 --> 01:06:39,807
I will call later to inform you
of the drop-off spot.

491
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:44,712
There will be a man there
to pick it up.

492
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,815
<i>-And then after, you will follow him to--
-Wait a minute.</i>

493
01:06:47,983 --> 01:06:50,213
Pulovski has to be at the drop off.

494
01:06:51,086 --> 01:06:55,489
So that your sharpshooters
can pick off my man and take the pig?

495
01:06:56,358 --> 01:06:58,588
<i>Who do you think you're talking to?</i>

496
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,354
No Pulovski, no drop off.

497
01:07:02,598 --> 01:07:05,829
Damn it! This guy is serious.

498
01:07:06,301 --> 01:07:11,637
You listen to me.
We got no time, no money and no leverage.

499
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:17,535
You don't get it, do you, Ray?
Pulovski's dead already.

500
01:07:20,482 --> 01:07:22,643
He just doesn't know it yet.

501
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,680
Yeah?

502
01:07:27,222 --> 01:07:32,854
I'm giving you one last chance.
You do as I say or the pig dies.

503
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:37,762
Okay, we'll do it, but I want to hear
Pulovski's voice, and l mean now.

504
01:07:39,301 --> 01:07:41,269
lt's for you.

505
01:07:42,337 --> 01:07:44,362
Try and be smart.

506
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:49,574
<i>-Nick! Nick, are you there?
-Yeah, "m here.</i>

507
01:07:49,745 --> 01:07:52,509
<i>You damn fool!
I told you to get off this case!</i>

508
01:07:52,681 --> 01:07:57,584
<i>But no, you had to be your stupid, stubborn,
son of a bitch self. Look where it got you!</i>
