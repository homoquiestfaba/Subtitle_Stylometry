1
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,353
Whether I'm right

2
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,690
Or whether I'm wrong

3
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:32,449
Whether I find a place in this world
Or never belong

4
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:41,291
I gotta be me, I've gotta be me

5
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,878
Greetings, fellow humans.

6
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,508
What you are about to see
is a historical record

7
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,843
of my life as a detective.

8
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,972
It has been rigorously fact-checked.

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,891
It is also highly confidential.

10
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:03,272
But I have agreed to document it
because my expertise is invaluable

11
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,691
to anyone who ever wanted
to be a detective.

12
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,110
Which is probably everyone.

13
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,323
That said, do not try any of what
you are about to see at home.

14
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,954
The high stakes world
of a professional detective is dangerous,

15
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,123
fast moving, and unpredictable.

16
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,670
Especially the part involving a truck,
a window, and a polar bear.

17
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,760
A world of success

18
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,223
It's waiting for me

19
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,020
If I heed the call

20
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,566
I won't settle down

21
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,235
Won't settle for less...

22
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,410
Mistakes were made.

23
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,456
But I should back up.

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,335
The story, not the truck.

25
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,879
This is where I live.

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,549
Well, not there, but, here.

27
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,970
North Portland,
in the shadow of this water tower.

28
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,890
My name is Failure, Timmy Failure.

29
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,392
My name used to be spelled like this.

30
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,189
But somebody changed it.
And now, it's spelled like this.

31
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,610
The name is misleading,
because I am anything but.

32
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,863
I am only concerned with one thing...

33
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,657
greatness.

34
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:42,829
I am the founder, president, and CEO
of my own detective agency.

35
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,082
It's the best detective agency in town.

36
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,958
Perhaps, the world.

37
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:52,005
This is my latest case.
Maybe the biggest of my storied career.

38
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,722
And that's my partner.
His name is Total.

39
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,101
He's a 1500-pound polar bear.

40
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,773
He's classified as a vulnerable species,
because his arctic home is melting.

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,818
So in 50 years,
it retreated more than it had

42
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,528
in the previous 200.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,114
So, he wandered for food.

44
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,033
First by sea...

45
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,272
and then by land.

46
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,126
Until he came to Portland.

47
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,091
Stumptown, the city
at the end of the trail.

48
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,427
- You're just leaving?
- I need to live my life.

49
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,874
Well, why can't you live it here
with us, like you promised?

50
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,743
You know, I'm sorry, all right?

51
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,683
You're sorry, all right.
A sorry loser!

52
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,061
A place where things get strange.

53
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,152
And he found our house...

54
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,240
and my cereal.

55
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,020
We buy good cereal.

56
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:19,342
Initially, he displayed a fair degree
of diligence and responsibility.

57
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,971
So, I amended the official license
of my agency.

58
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,724
And agreed to make him a full partner.

59
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,727
Which was a mistake.

60
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,941
The diligence and responsibility
were a ruse.

61
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,319
It's something polar bears do.

62
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,073
My mode of transportation
is the key to my success.

63
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,509
It's called the Failure Mobile.

64
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,347
It is an imposing machine
that allows me unlimited access

65
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,723
to the entire town.

66
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,684
And it commands the respect of others.

67
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,564
'Cause on the mean streets of Portland,
respect is critical.

68
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,360
It should also be noted that it belongs
to my mother,

69
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:20,111
who won it in a church raffle.

70
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:25,242
I won! I won; I never win crap.
Boom!

71
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,746
She calls it her stress reliever.

72
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,460
And so, she set forth some restrictions
on when and how I can use it.

73
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,420
Never, ever, ever!

74
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,506
I thought that was vague...

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,383
so I use it.

76
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,932
My relationship with local law enforcement
is problematic.

77
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:55,272
They admire my talent, but resent the fact
that I refuse to collaborate.

78
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,276
But I don't have to,
because business is booming.

79
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,572
Portland is a city
that is rife with crime,

80
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,156
corruption...

81
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,450
and Russians.

82
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,506
That's a demerit.

83
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,012
- Hello, Gunnar.
- Hey, Timmy. What do you want?

84
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,764
I understand someone stole your backpack.

85
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,225
Yeah, so?

86
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,686
You may be wondering how I know that.

87
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,939
I posted signs all over school.

88
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,776
I want you to know
that we are professional and discreet.

89
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,075
We can find your backpack.

90
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,745
Who's we?

91
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,878
We're wasting valuable time.

92
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,797
I normally keep
my backpack right there.

93
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,092
But, all I really care about
is my Swiss Army knife.

94
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,969
It was in the front pocket.

95
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,180
- So, you're Swiss?
- No.

96
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,765
But you fight with knives?

97
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,435
I got it for scouting. I'm trying to earn
my survival skills badge.

98
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,314
You got to survive in the woods,
for two days, with only a knife.

99
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,483
Survive what exactly?

100
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,777
Whatever comes.

101
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,072
Yes, yeah!

102
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,666
Good luck, Son.

103
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,921
Maybe go for the bird watching badge
instead.

104
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,803
I have to do my homework now, Timmy.

105
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,972
Is this for enemy surveillance?

106
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,349
It's for looking at stars.

107
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,061
Good cover. I think we're done here.

108
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,439
- You didn't do anything.
- Incorrect.

109
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,151
I surveyed the crime scene
and reached a comprehensive conclusion.

110
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,697
Backpack, gone.

111
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,032
I'll show myself out.

112
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,248
That's the closet.

113
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,417
Correct.

114
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,187
- Who are you?
- Timmy. Who are you?

115
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,939
Gabe.

116
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,985
- You live here?
- No, someone just put my name on the wall.

117
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,108
What's with the dumb scarf?

118
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,532
It's distinctive.

119
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,868
Yeah, it's also not normal.

120
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,787
Normal is for normal people.

121
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,207
Close the door, weirdo.

122
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,504
With you on the outside.

123
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,052
Get out, or I'm gonna pound you!

124
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,901
Timmy, you're nuts for going in there.
Gabe's in middle school.

125
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,444
He's got a screw loose.

126
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,112
I was looking for clues.

127
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,532
- Did you find any?
- Of course.

128
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,576
Gabe, very rude.

129
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,751
Backpack, gone.

130
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,170
Gabe, very rude.

131
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,341
What am I missing?

132
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,385
As darkness falls,

133
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,139
I continue to wrestle
with the complexities of the Gunnar case.

134
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,476
The good news is that my mother
has two jobs.

135
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,271
So, I am left alone
to work in peace and quiet.

136
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,442
The bad news is
my cramped office conditions.

137
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,446
Timmy, I'm home.

138
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,241
It's inhumane.

139
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,325
Timmy?

140
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,789
I have plans to renovate,
so I scheduled a teleconference.

141
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,791
- Mother.
- Yep?

142
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,502
It would be helpful if you would get rid
of all your clothes.

143
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,254
I need more office space.

144
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,089
I'm not getting rid of my clothes.

145
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:33,609
You need a bigger office,
you look for it somewhere else.

146
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,634
Eat your burger.

147
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,719
- Server.
- Yeah?

148
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,388
I need the real estate listings.

149
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,557
Oh, are you serious?

150
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,267
- He's not.
- I am.

151
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,018
No. That's... Thank you. No.

152
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,688
- Okay.
- Eat.

153
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,275
I'll probably move my office downtown.
More prestige.

154
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,277
Why limit yourself to downtown?

155
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,999
It's your world headquarters,
you've got to think bigger.

156
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,364
- Bigger?
- Yeah.

157
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,117
Like, I always wanted to live
in New York City.

158
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,287
The music scene, museums,
the Broadway shows,

159
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,416
you would love Broadway, buddy.
That's where you should have your office.

160
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,938
Failure!

161
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,991
I'll stay in Portland.

162
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,953
I tell you what,
if you finish all of your food,

163
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,277
we'll pick up the real estate listings
on our way home.

164
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,082
Commercial real estate?

165
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,668
Of course. More prestige.

166
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,759
Note to file, consider hiring Mother
for global planning position.

167
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,427
Thanks, buddy.

168
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,979
And so, I set my lofty sights
on a new world headquarters,

169
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,981
befitting my agency.

170
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,032
Psst!

171
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,869
Rents are higher than anticipated.

172
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,538
It's urgent we crack the Gunnar case.

173
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,134
Timmy, get up.

174
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,017
And once we crack the Gunnar case,
bingo bango.

175
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,602
We'll be making billions.

176
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,024
And with all that cash,
we'll be able to open our new office.

177
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,776
Downtown.

178
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,737
We'll return to Gunnar's after school.

179
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,864
Dust for fingerprints,

180
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,534
- take some hair samples.
- Love you buddy!

181
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,121
Hey, Timmy. Come on, you're gonna be late.

182
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,917
We'll reconvene at recess.

183
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,965
I don't like it either.

184
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,758
School policy.

185
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,041
School policy. They're anti-bear.

186
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,809
Hypocrites.

187
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,101
You're late, Failure.

188
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,193
- Again.
- Mr. Crocus. He's problematic.

189
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,405
Oh and, Failure, it's your turn
to take care of Hammy Ham.

190
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,450
Pick him up at Maxine's house tomorrow
after school.

191
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,327
I can't. Busy.

192
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,372
I don't mind taking care of Hammy Ham
for another week, or longer.

193
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,499
No. Failure...

194
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,878
you pick up that hamster
or you get detention.

195
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,426
- What are you in for?
- Murder.

196
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,930
- You?
- Not caring for the class hamster.

197
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,351
- I'll get the rodent.
- Good choice.

198
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,483
The people I sit with
are also problematic. Like her.

199
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,693
- Hi, Timmy.
- Molly Moskins.

200
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,655
She smiles too much
and smells like a tangerine.

201
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,743
Clear your desks,
we're going to have a quiz.

202
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,204
And him, Charles Tookus.

203
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,083
Prefers to be called Rollo,
he's a former employee of my agency.

204
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,419
- Is this a surprise quiz?
- Did you know about it?

205
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,338
- No.
- Then...

206
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,757
surprise!

207
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,052
I... I'm totally unprepared.

208
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,555
He has a nervous condition,
so, I had to let him go.

209
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,685
But she's the most problematic.
I call her The Nameless One.

210
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,898
Because I am never ever going
to talk about her. Ever.

211
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,235
Now, you can expect
four more of these quizzes

212
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,154
- before the end of the year.
- Is that even legal?

213
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,951
I used to think Scantron tests
were formulaic and demoralizing.

214
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,662
Now I see them
as a form of artistic expression.

215
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,914
Hmmm.

216
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,506
Ah!

217
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,051
One final thing, all remaining quizzes
will be graded

218
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,720
on the combined average of your quadrant.

219
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,389
What, why?

220
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,351
I'm attempting to foster collaboration,
Mr. Tookus.

221
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,480
Working together,
maybe the only chance you have

222
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,358
of surviving middle school next year.

223
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,069
- Oh, we're dead.
- Why?

224
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,406
Timmy doesn't study, he'll tank our grade.

225
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,659
Grades are the least of my concerns,
Rollo Tookus.

226
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,578
What are your concerns, Timmy?

227
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,084
I cannot collaborate
with The Nameless One.

228
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,838
Well, I don't know
what that means exactly,

229
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,215
but I'm sure
we can problem solve the situation.

230
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,594
Molly Moskins, do you have something
you'd like to share?

231
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,016
No, but Timmy does.
And I think he should be heard.

232
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,560
Oh, well,

233
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,772
if something is troubling you,
Mr. Failure, then by all means,

234
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,192
stand up and share. Stand up.

235
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,490
Well, speak up, Failure.

236
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,534
We're all waiting.

237
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,125
- You can do it, Timmy.
- Say something, Timmy.

238
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,254
As I expected. Now sit down, Failure.

239
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,132
But sitting with The Nameless One
was not an option.

240
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,092
Sit down...

241
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,512
or go to the Principal's office.

242
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,139
So, I was forced to improvise.

243
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,809
What are you doing now?

244
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,771
Sitting down, but over here.

245
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,483
All right. That's it. Get out.
Get out of my class.

246
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,112
Without the desk!

247
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:25,127
Recess is the only opportunity
I have to do global strategy planning

248
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,379
for the agency.

249
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,008
So, I sit in the one spot
that allows my business partner

250
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,176
to participate.

251
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,223
And where no one else can listen in
on our highly confidential meetings.

252
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,141
Like the other kids...

253
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,270
or The Nameless One.

254
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,149
Or the Russians.

255
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,830
- I wouldn't approach the fence.
- Why not?

256
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,790
For your own safety.

257
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,669
Whatever, weirdo.

258
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,465
Ignore him. Jealous.

259
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,928
You'll have to return to Gunnar's
without me after school.

260
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,389
I'm going to be delayed.

261
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,352
Now, by my estimation,

262
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,898
we've had 11 meetings so far this year,

263
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:32,987
and neither Timmy's grades
nor his behavior are improving.

264
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,907
And worse, he doesn't seem to care.

265
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,411
I know it may not seem like it sometimes,
but Timmy does care.

266
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,583
He just... he cares in a...
a different way.

267
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,754
Hmm, well, be that as it may,

268
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,506
if this keeps up,
we're gonna have to suspend him.

269
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,217
No. No, that... that won't be necessary.

270
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:59,013
- He... he'll do better. I promise.
- Ms. Failure, as you know,

271
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,308
this is Timmy's final year at Carverette.

272
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:07,313
He's supposed to move on to middle school
next year with the rest of his class.

273
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,609
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

274
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,738
One, two, three, four, five, six...

275
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:20,993
Needless to say, this will be
a significant change for your son.

276
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,081
Middle school is a much bigger place.

277
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,126
It can be quite intimidating.

278
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,381
The classes are larger.

279
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,264
The teacher student ratio is extreme.

280
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,646
And the amount of schoolwork
will increase substantially.

281
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,529
It will be an exceedingly heavy workload.

282
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,579
The point is, Ms. Failure,
that we've made the mistake

283
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,874
of coddling your son for far too long.

284
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,421
And when he gets to middle school,
that's over. Finished.

285
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,008
He's going to have to stop living
in his own world.

286
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,053
I understand, absolutely.

287
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,057
Timmy, tell Mr. Crocus that you're sorry.

288
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,101
For what exactly?

289
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,354
For disrupting the class.

290
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,357
I'm trying to focus on my quiz, Mother.

291
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,693
My quadrant is depending on me.

292
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,403
Timmy!

293
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,823
Mistakes were made.

294
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,582
I can't believe this.

295
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,836
If you get suspended, I am screwed.
I'm serious, Timmy.

296
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,631
I can't afford childcare,
and I can't afford to stay home with you.

297
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,675
We can barely pay our rent as it is.

298
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,803
You gotta help me out here, buddy, okay?
I'm serious.

299
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,016
Mother was upset,
but she didn't need to be.

300
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,809
The Solution was obvious.

301
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,063
Fifth grade would be the final year
of my formal education.

302
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,615
Okay, so what leads did you dig up
on the Gunnar case?

303
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,494
What do you mean?
You accomplished nothing?

304
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,790
We need to crack the Gunnar case
so we can move our offices downtown.

305
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,087
Timmy, stop. What are you doing?

306
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,424
Not my fault. Disgruntled employee.

307
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,010
Well, stop. I'm trying to pay some bills.

308
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:47,223
And you need to get ready for bed.
Come out from under there, please.

309
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,065
These bills are nothing.
When my agency expands...

310
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,693
I will be able to pay you
ten times your current salary.

311
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,698
You don't need to worry about my salary.

312
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,326
All you have to worry about is school.

313
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,664
- Promise me you're going to try harder.
- Affirmative.

314
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,585
You need to learn to say
you're sorry sometimes, like today. Okay?

315
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,879
Affirmative.

316
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,173
Affirmative. Affirmative.

317
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,760
- That's not normal.
- Good.

318
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,763
Normal is for normal people.

319
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,352
Stop that. It's unprofessional.

320
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,522
Do it again.

321
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,870
For a detective, time equals money.

322
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:56,125
So, it's profoundly annoying
when I'm forced to do such trivial things.

323
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,460
Like pick up the class hamster.

324
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,470
Keep an eye on things.

325
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,812
Hi, Timmy. Are you here for Hammy Ham?

326
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,814
Affirmative.

327
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,276
Can you keep a secret?

328
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,573
You sure he's dead?

329
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,284
He hasn't moved for three days.

330
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,662
Note to file, possible homicide.

331
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,709
- I'll need a shoe box.
- Why? What are you going to do?

332
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,419
Take the body to the lab...

333
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,421
open an investigation.

334
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,590
This will probably hit the papers.

335
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,509
It's not my fault. I... I love animals.

336
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,304
I'm on the planning committee
for Animal Awareness Month.

337
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,182
You should consider stepping down
till this blows over.

338
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,768
Which it probably won't.

339
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,362
Papa Bear, coming out with the body.

340
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,542
So unprofessional.

341
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,927
With suspected homicides,
it's important to get the corpse to morgue

342
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,430
as quickly as possible
for forensic analysis.

343
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,101
Which I would do right now...

344
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,478
if the Failure Mobile was here.

345
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,355
But it's not.

346
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,067
So, I calmly considered
the implications to my business...

347
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,320
and my domestic life.

348
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,197
Never, ever, ever.

349
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,658
- And my future.
- Mr. Failure...

350
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,036
scarf off.

351
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,667
And I make a brief note
in my detective log.

352
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,211
Timmy, dead.

353
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,507
We've talked about this.
You're never supposed to swim

354
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,260
when you're on duty. You're supposed
to keep an eye on things.

355
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,012
Hi, Timmy.

356
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,806
You are receiving multiple demerits
for this.

357
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:20,641
- He's fired up today.
- I know, it's so exciting.

358
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:23,441
Finding the Failure Mobile
is now our top priority.

359
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,444
Cancel all other cases.

360
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,641
Hi, Timmy.

361
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,158
- Hi, Mrs. Tookus.
- Is everything all right?

362
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,244
I need to see Rollo, urgent matters.

363
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,102
Oh, he's not here.
He's at his fencing class.

364
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,086
Picket, chain link...

365
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,464
lattice.

366
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,383
Do you have the address?

367
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
All right, guys. Halt.
Look at me for a second.

368
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,395
Just try to focus on bending your knees,
doing good actions.

369
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,327
Plus concentrate on footwork as we do it.

370
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,857
Peter, you're doing great.

371
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:09,318
Anton, a little more speed.
Be a little faster.

372
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,446
No, no, Sophia, more actions,
more dynamic stuff.

373
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,947
Rollo, can you focus please?

374
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:16,867
Rose, try to set your corner up,
good actions in and out.

375
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,622
Note to file,
Rollo training to be an assassin.

376
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,291
Possible betrayal, remain vigilant.

377
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,178
That's a demerit.

378
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,225
It's obviously a case
of industrial sabotage.

379
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,520
They must've known the Failure Mobile
is the key to my success.

380
00:26:44,884 --> 00:26:48,440
Fine. But I have to go home and study,
you have to study.

381
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,944
- We're being graded together now.
- You're too nervous, Rollo Tookus.

382
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,780
- That's why I fired you.
- You didn't fire me, I quit.

383
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:59,159
Incorrect. But the point is, I'm willing
to hire you back at a higher salary.

384
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,496
- Considering your new skill set.
- What new skill set?

385
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,916
- That of an assassin.
- I'm not training to be an assassin.

386
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,710
My dad thinks fencing will help me
get into Stanford.

387
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,672
Sport is a waste of your talents,
Rollo Tookus.

388
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,676
- I'll speak to your father.
- No way. You always get me into trouble.

389
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,178
- Absurd.
- What about Operation Sumo?

390
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,891
Where are you? Over.

391
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,811
- Outside, over.
- Outside?

392
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,398
- Why are you outside? Over.
- Can I help you?

393
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,608
Ambush, run! Over!

394
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,656
- We needed a disguise.
- I was grounded for a month.

395
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,449
What are you doing?

396
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,413
Open it. Then maybe you'll understand
the gravity of the situation.

397
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,754
- Is that Hammy Ham?
- Correct. He's been murdered.

398
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,132
Did Maxine Schellenberger do it?

399
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,718
We won't know until we do an autopsy.

400
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,721
But I've suspended all cases
until we find the Failure Mobile.

401
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,183
Hey, maybe the same person
that killed Hammy Ham

402
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,309
stole the Failure Mobile.

403
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,687
Good point.
That means it couldn't be Maxine

404
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,856
because she was with me
when it was stolen.

405
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,942
That means it was a professional hit.

406
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,821
- That means, the Russians!
- The Russians!

407
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:21,116
Okay, I'm in. I'll help you find
the Failure Mobile,

408
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,076
but you have to promise me
that you'll study.

409
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,578
- Deal?
- Deal.

410
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,497
- I'm going to see Flo.
- Why?

411
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:31,084
- Gather intel.
- That's not studying.

412
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,599
If you are disrupting the solitude
of this sacred place,

413
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,436
I will find you and silence you.
Thank you.

414
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,661
That's a demerit.

415
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,123
Oh, no.

416
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,962
I need your help on an urgent matter, Flo.

417
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,465
Of course you do.
It's always urgent with you, Timmy.

418
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,885
- What's in that box?
- You do not want to know.

419
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,136
All right.

420
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,392
Read this. I need any intel you have
on them.

421
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,727
The Russians?

422
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,120
You weren't supposed to say it out loud.

423
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:38,527
Okay. Russian travel, Russian cooking,
Russian authors?

424
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,861
Negative.

425
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,906
Then could you be a little more specific?

426
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,869
Russian operatives.

427
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,289
You said it out loud again.

428
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:54,626
Okay, so you want a Russian spy novel?

429
00:29:54,723 --> 00:29:58,255
No. I want intel on actual spies
living locally.

430
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,966
Okay, Timmy. Listen.

431
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:06,680
You spent all winter cooped up in here.
It's nice out. Just go and play.

432
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,641
- I'm not your babysitter.
- Hi, Timmy.

433
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,352
Hello.

434
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,556
- I finished with the flyers, Flo.
- Good work, Molly.

435
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,358
Want to join our rally, Timmy?
It's for Animal Awareness Month.

436
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,737
Are you aware that this school
has an anti-bear policy?

437
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,490
- Really?
- Yes, it's tearing the school apart.

438
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,036
I didn't know anything about it.
Tell me more.

439
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,873
I can't discuss it right now,
I'm collaborating with Flo.

440
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,958
Oh, we're done collaborating.

441
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,461
I don't know any Russians, Timmy.

442
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,296
- I do.
- You do?

443
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,173
- Yeah, I do.
- Hold on.

444
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,427
Molly Moskins, source.

445
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,262
Proceed.

446
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,266
Um, Boris, he worked at our church,
but he died.

447
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,185
Probably not Boris.

448
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,146
And Corrina Corrina's part Russian.

449
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,857
The Nameless One is part Russian?

450
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,819
Why do you call her The Nameless One?
Do you like her or something?

451
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,946
Don't be absurd, Flo.

452
00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:08,325
- Go on, Molly.
- Well, her grandmother's from Russia.

453
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:10,327
So, that makes her part Russian.

454
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:15,749
Finally, I could see The Nameless One
for who she really is.

455
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,584
A Russian operative.

456
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,963
- How reliable is this intel?
- Very.

457
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,217
She did a show and tell last year
with these Russian nesting dolls

458
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,385
that her baba gave her.

459
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,553
That's Russian for grandma.

460
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,515
I think we're done here.

461
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,434
- I'll circle back, Flo.
- No need.

462
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,730
Papa Bear, ready to move.

463
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,861
He's so fascinating.

464
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,076
Timmy! Have you seen my compact?

465
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,829
- The little mirror?
- Negative.

466
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,624
- Are you sure?
- Affirmative.

467
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,920
Shoot. Can you get the door?

468
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,172
Can't.

469
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,092
- Deep in the case.
- Timmy, please. My friend is here.

470
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,931
Why?

471
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,976
I invited him over for dinner.

472
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,854
- Did you run a background check?
- No. I know him.

473
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,782
Besides, he works
for the police department.

474
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,571
We met him, at the pharmacy. Remember?

475
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,573
The meter maid?

476
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,075
His name is Crispin and he's nice.

477
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,035
He's an underachiever.

478
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,787
Just go. Go on, please.

479
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,502
- But he gave us a ticket.
- He took it back.

480
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,883
- Which makes him a corrupt underachiever.
- Timmy, would you go now?

481
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,601
Absurd.

482
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,984
Hey, Timmy. What's up, man? I'm Crispin.
You remember me?

483
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,154
I remember everything.

484
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,115
That's cool. I don't, man.

485
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,868
I forget everything.
I have a horrible memory.

486
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,453
Especially with names.

487
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,207
Yeah. Bad with names. Good with people,
bad with names.

488
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,544
- Is your mom home?
- Potentially.

489
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,507
- What's that?
- I bought chocolates for your mom.

490
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,258
Oh, I got something for you too, dude.

491
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,846
It's a lucky rabbit's foot.
I got a collection of these.

492
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,184
- What have we got?
- Another one, doctor.

493
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,269
Back left foot, gone.

494
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,441
I can't accept that.
It's Animal Awareness Month.

495
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,569
Oh. Sorry, I didn't know that.

496
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,114
That's awesome, though.
So I should hold on to this or...

497
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,616
I'll keep it as evidence.

498
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,661
- Hi.
- Hey.

499
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,997
Timmy, did you ask Crispin
to come inside?

500
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,541
Negative.

501
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,211
Well, could you please? Now.

502
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,049
You may enter... our home.

503
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,301
Thanks, buddy. I appreciate that.

504
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,429
- These are for you.
- Oh, that's very sweet, thank you.

505
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,698
- Well... come in. Come in.
- All right.

506
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,017
- We're... we're eating out back.
- Great.

507
00:34:25,805 --> 00:34:27,405
He maims his rabbits.

508
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,695
This is good. You're an excellent cook.

509
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,573
Thank you,
I... I didn't make this though.

510
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,319
I... I was going to cook
and then I just ran out of time.

511
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,828
But still, really good.

512
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,499
- Mother.
- Not now, Timmy.

513
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,127
- I think we should end this meal.
- Stop.

514
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,588
He doesn't have proper clearance.

515
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,716
Whoa, clearance for what?

516
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,635
- No, nothing. He's just pretending.
- No, I'm not.

517
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,733
You sure it wasn't a meter maid joke?
I get those a lot.

518
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,559
No. No, it wasn't a meter maid joke.
Was it, Timmy?

519
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,811
It's okay. I get it.

520
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:06,926
You know, people really don't like
meter maids.

521
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,512
It's actually why I became one.

522
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,650
So that you wouldn't be liked?

523
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,320
No, so I could change
people's perceptions.

524
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,030
Turn negative into a positive.

525
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,324
For example, if I do give a ticket,

526
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,634
- which I hate to do...
- Right.

527
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,813
People get really upset.

528
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,078
I'll usually write a little note.
Like, "I'm sorry"

529
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:25,040
or "I know this is a real drag."
And if they engage...

530
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,043
I just try to listen. Hear them out.

531
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,794
Huh!

532
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,880
- Can I have my phone back now?
- No.

533
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,816
You know, Timmy, if you're interested,
I could show you around

534
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,634
- the precinct sometime.
- Negative.

535
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,386
I don't collaborate
with local law enforcement.

536
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,764
- Oh, how come?
- I have a partner.

537
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,390
Oh, that's cool, who's that?

538
00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:45,685
Meter nearing expiration
on the southwest corner

539
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,690
of Albina and Webster,
we have a Blue Dodge Neon

540
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,010
in a passenger loading only zone,
no passengers loading...

541
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:58,114
- I'll introduce you sometime.
- Great. Let's make that happen.

542
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,500
Do you know
why you're here, Timmy?

543
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:14,586
Negative.

544
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:19,177
Well, it seems like you've been having
a difficult time in class,

545
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,102
so the school thought
we should talk about it.

546
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,640
Mistakes were made.

547
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,020
Or we can talk about anything else
that's on your mind.

548
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,316
Nice office. What's the rent?

549
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,820
Comes with the job.
You looking for office space?

550
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,197
Affirmative, but downtown.

551
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,908
What do you need the office space for?

552
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,839
I think we're done here.

553
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,489
We have 20 more minutes actually.

554
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:53,920
Is this armor plated?

555
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,922
I think it's just metal.

556
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,884
Timmy, just so you know...

557
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,763
whatever you share with me in this room,
stays in this room.

558
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,599
- This is a safe space.
- So, no bugs?

559
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,477
- Bugs?
- Listening devices.

560
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,772
Oh. No. There are no bugs.

561
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,953
- Order of knishes.
- Thank you.

562
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:31,416
Doubtful. My work is very important.
A lot of people rely on me.

563
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,836
- Like who?
- My mom, my partner...

564
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,880
the city of Portland.

565
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,008
That's a lot of pressure.

566
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,594
How much more time now?

567
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:45,847
Eighteen minutes.

568
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,644
Yeah, definitely not armor.

569
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,362
I can't believe Corrina Corrina's
a Russian agent.

570
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,449
It's true.
Molly Moskins confirmed it.

571
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,745
- She's only so nice to everyone.
- It's her cover, I saw through it.

572
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,789
These houses are huge.

573
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,166
Crime pays.

574
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,835
I wonder what Corrina Corrina's house
looks like.

575
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,837
I have a pretty good idea.

576
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,805
Why do you think the Russians
want the Failure Mobile anyway?

577
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,390
They just want to sabotage the agency.

578
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:34,854
- So they can execute their master plan.
- Yeah. Russians always have a master plan.

579
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,398
There it is, 2495.

580
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,612
Just as I imagined. Pure evil.

581
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,037
Clear.

582
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,166
- We have to be very careful where we step.
- How come?

583
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,669
The property is probably loaded
with trip wires.

584
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,089
Down!

585
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:03,501
- They're armed.
- I think they're just squirt guns.

586
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,427
Correct, she's probably squirting
a corrosive acid.

587
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,929
No way, they're laughing.

588
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,431
Some acids burn your skin
and make you laugh.

589
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,851
Hi, Rollo. Hi, Timmy.

590
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,728
Hi, Corrina.

591
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,772
Hello.

592
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,816
What are you guys doing?

593
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,526
Just standing.

594
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,821
On this public sidewalk.

595
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,703
That's my dad. Bye, you guys.

596
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,542
Whoa! Look at that car.

597
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,544
It's so cool.

598
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,423
- It's probably stolen.
- No way, they're rich.

599
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,841
Her dad owns a bank.

600
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,718
- What?
- Yeah.

601
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,470
He talked to our class on Career Day.
Remember?

602
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,681
I purposely did not listen.

603
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,269
Well, he did. And he is very nice.

604
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,813
He gave us all free pens.

605
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,942
- Everybody really liked him.
- Let's go.

606
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,071
- What's wrong with you?
- We've been duped.

607
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,033
- The Failure Mobile isn't here.
- So, where is it?

608
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,411
If you wanted to keep something safe,
where would you keep it?

609
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,372
- Under my mattress.
- Wrong. A bank.

610
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,084
We can't break into a bank. We'll go
to prison for the rest of our lives.

611
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,630
Rollo Tookus, still has nervous condition.

612
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,469
There are many horrific places
where I wouldn't want to be.

613
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,638
Menaced by beavers...

614
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,310
barreling down Multnomah Falls.

615
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,777
Forced to attend
The World Naked Bike Ride...

616
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,200
and then see Mr. Crocus.

617
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,665
But this place tops the list.

618
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,333
Where's my Segway?

619
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,294
Answer me, Timmy.

620
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,006
Mistakes were made.

621
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,301
Timmy!

622
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,639
That was the one nice thing I had,
the one nice thing!

623
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,849
I told you never to use it!

624
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,895
I won that thing at church,
and I told you how much I liked it.

625
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,359
Facing a code red situation.
I improvised.

626
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,152
I lent it to Molly Moskins.

627
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,780
Uh, who's Molly Moskins?

628
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,032
A girl in my class.

629
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,536
She needed it for her stupid rally.

630
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,790
Timmy that was...
that was not yours to lend.

631
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,460
It's not my fault.
She smells like a tangerine.

632
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,213
Who does? Molly Moskins?

633
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,048
Affirmative.

634
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,677
Timmy, I told you never to touch
my Segway, right?

635
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:55,572
And... and... I'm glad
that you're getting involved in school,

636
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,306
but this kind of behavior has got to stop.

637
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:01,310
Okay, this is work. I have to take this.

638
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,522
I want my Segway back,
the moment that rally is done.

639
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,528
And I'm calling Molly Moskins's mother.

640
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,700
And don't go anywhere.

641
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,411
If she was calling
Molly Moskins's mother,

642
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,329
I had to get to Molly first...

643
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,835
and make a deal.

644
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,592
A seedy backroom deal.

645
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,386
Tea?

646
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,056
Can we stick to business?

647
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:40,182
Okay.

648
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,269
So, you want me to tell my mom
to tell your mom,

649
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,229
that we're using your Segway in the rally?

650
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,773
Correct.

651
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,733
Why did you choose me?

652
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,402
My agency chose you.

653
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,196
Talent agency?

654
00:42:54,352 --> 00:42:57,063
- Detective agency.
- Oh!

655
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,411
Did you hear about the purse snatchings?
I saw it on the news.

656
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,789
I deal with bigger cases...
Holy smokes!

657
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,750
That's my cat, Señor Burrito.

658
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,251
Is it trained?

659
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:12,048
Aw, she likes you. Probably because
you're odd and mysterious.

660
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,759
Get it off me, before I'm mauled.

661
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,595
Señor Burrito, vamonos, vamonos.

662
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,642
- Isn't this fun?
- It's business.

663
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,311
The future of my agency is at stake.

664
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,981
Okay, okay.
So, you want me to be your cover.

665
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,858
Affirmative.

666
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,112
Well, my answer is yes.

667
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,739
I will cover you anytime, Timmy.

668
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,661
Be professional, Molly.

669
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,831
Fine.

670
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,834
I'll be professional.

671
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,505
If you want my help, you have to sign up
for the Animal Awareness rally.

672
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,674
- Negative.
- And...

673
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,224
- you have to paint my nails.
- Absurd!

674
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,068
And when we're done,
I'm going to paint your nails.

675
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,312
I think you've had too much tea.

676
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:11,160
You want me to be your cover, don't you?

677
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,610
Well, right now your cover
isn't feeling very cover-y.

678
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,744
Blackmail comes in many shades.
Including hot pink.

679
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,089
- Did you study?
- Negative.

680
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,550
We had a deal.

681
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,433
- Would you help me with the bank?
- No way.

682
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,436
No bank, no deal.

683
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,729
Failure...

684
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,648
no talking.

685
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,277
I wasn't talking, I was mouthing.

686
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,488
No mouthing, either.

687
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,206
If my mom finds out
I went downtown,

688
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,625
- I'm dead.
- She won't.

689
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,920
You just say that because your mom
has no idea where you are.

690
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,421
She works all the time.

691
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,883
Negative. I say it because this mission
is highly classified.

692
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,802
This is a bad idea. I just know it.

693
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,430
Stop panicking. We have backup.

694
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:39,111
It's a vast complex.
Numerous points of ingress and egress.

695
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,323
It's huge. This is nuts.

696
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,242
Did you bring the marbles?

697
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,661
Yes.

698
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,214
What are these for anyway?

699
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,884
Contingency plan. Let's put on the masks.

700
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,513
These are just on loan, by the way.

701
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,631
- Now what?
- Follow me.

702
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,285
The Failure Mobile
is undoubtedly in the vault.

703
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,038
People are staring at us.

704
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,249
Jealous, ignore them.

705
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,424
- What are you doing?
- Gathering intel.

706
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,217
Good idea.

707
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:45,928
Can I help you boys?

708
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:51,142
Uh, we'd like to inspect
your vault. It's very important, Sir.

709
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,728
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

710
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,481
Okay. Then we'll just be
heading home. Right, Timmy?

711
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,359
- Negative.
- Would you mind removing your masks?

712
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,404
- Why?
- Bank policy. No masks.

713
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,574
We need to see everyone's face.

714
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,618
- We're being watched.
- Of course we are!

715
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:12,580
We're in a bank.
And we're wearing fencing masks.

716
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,042
That's when it hit me...

717
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,711
it was a trap.

718
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,965
We were surrounded.

719
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,177
But who tipped them off?

720
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,723
Of course, it was a family affair.

721
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,478
- Oh, no.
- You need to remove those masks, now.

722
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,938
Timmy, we need to remove
our masks.

723
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,775
- Never. Get ready.
- Get ready for what?

724
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,151
The diversion.

725
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,280
- Plastic?
- Yeah, it's safer.

726
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,744
It's an ambush, run!

727
00:47:52,133 --> 00:47:54,288
- Hey, stop!
- Why did you do that?

728
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,165
- Thank me later.
- I can't breathe.

729
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,417
- Keep your mask on.
- I'm suffocating!

730
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,588
Papa Bear! Papa Bear!
Papa Bear! Need backup.

731
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,965
Repeat, need backup.

732
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,263
Okay, Timmy. Classified information,
bugs, armor-plated desks.

733
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,369
I have to ask.

734
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,934
Are you a spy?

735
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,520
- Negative.
- Don't worry.

736
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,856
I had the place swept for bugs.
We can talk freely.

737
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,651
I'm a detective.

738
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,780
Ah! Yes, that makes sense.

739
00:48:29,495 --> 00:48:31,175
So, you're having trouble
with your agency.

740
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,494
- Affirmative.
- How so?

741
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,163
Someone is attempting to sabotage it.

742
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,749
- Do you know who?
- I can't discuss it with you.

743
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,585
Ongoing investigation.

744
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,296
But the success of my agency is at stake.

745
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,006
Oh, yeah?

746
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,384
What is your idea of success?

747
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,302
Greatness.

748
00:48:52,135 --> 00:48:54,110
Have you talked to your mom
about any of this?

749
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:56,851
Why not?

750
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,104
She's collaborating
with local law enforcement.

751
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,783
Mother, can I have a tissue?

752
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,625
He's low level, but very corrupt.

753
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,503
Also he maims rabbits.

754
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,505
Hmm.

755
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:30,468
Well, I know this is probably
not the best time to ask but...

756
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,512
is there any chance I could hire you?

757
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,347
What's the case?

758
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,320
I'd like you to do
a little undercover work for me,

759
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,894
in Mr. Crocus's class.

760
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,648
- You want intel.
- Yeah, I want intel.

761
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,192
How in depth?

762
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,319
Let's start with the homework
he's assigning you.

763
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:50,459
I want to see it,
make sure it's on the up and up.

764
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,907
- Completed homework?
- Yes, completed.

765
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,700
That will definitely cost more.

766
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,709
All right, people. Lock it down.
Lock it down!

767
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,296
Hey, we've got a rally to plan,
and awareness to raise.

768
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,299
Now, who are my domesticated animals?
Raise your hands.

769
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,136
Good. Who are my wild animals?

770
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,389
All right, is that everyone?

771
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,725
Yes, you.

772
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,604
I don't know what group this is exactly,
but I'd like to do a tribute

773
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,397
to Hammy Ham, our class hamster.

774
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,525
He's dead...

775
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,072
of natural causes.

776
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,951
I like it. Very thoughtful.
Molly, take a note.

777
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,285
Copy.

778
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,121
Timmy, what group are you in?

779
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,291
- I'm in no group.
- You have to be in a group.

780
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,961
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

781
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,046
Not if he's protesting.

782
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,881
What is he protesting?

783
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,384
Probably the anti-bear policy.

784
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,970
There's an anti-bear policy?

785
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,597
Absolutely, I've heard about it, too.

786
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,558
- From who?
- Timmy.

787
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:05,354
Okay. Timmy, can you tell us
about the anti-bear policy?

788
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:08,983
Timmy?

789
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:12,861
Listen, if you feel strongly
about something, you have to speak out.

790
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,488
Right? Why do you think I'm here?

791
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:18,117
Because I like you? No. Definitely not.

792
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,246
It's because I want to teach you guys
to make an impact on the world.

793
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:27,126
Because if you don't,
we are collectively screwed. You got it?

794
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,503
Timmy.

795
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,717
Come on.
Buddy, you gotta give me something.

796
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,053
Affirmative.

797
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,389
All right, I'll take it.

798
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,656
All right, people, let's get up.
Let's get to work! Got a lot to do.

799
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:45,477
Come on, get to your tables.

800
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,734
We've got two weeks
to get this rally together,

801
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,189
that's not a lot of time.

802
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,110
But that was a profound
understatement. Time was running out.

803
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:57,031
I had to liberate the Failure Mobile
from the bank, tonight.

804
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,744
And that meant sending my bear,
who was often unreliable.

805
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,872
I told him to avoid well-lit places.

806
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,124
He did not listen.

807
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,338
I advised him to steer clear
of any obvious entrance.

808
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,215
He did not listen.

809
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,678
And I urged him to avoid any distractions.

810
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,806
Once again, he did not listen.

811
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,270
But most importantly, I told him
to approach the Failure Mobile

812
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,814
with caution and the utmost delicacy.

813
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,779
But he was too fat.

814
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,883
Papa Bear. Papa Bear.
We need to revise plan.

815
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,053
- Bank ceiling will not support girth.
- Hey, Timmy.

816
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,014
How you doing, buddy?

817
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,226
What are you doing here?

818
00:53:07,757 --> 00:53:10,518
Well, I was working in the area,
I thought you might want a ride home.

819
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,191
A good detective
always keeps his enemies close.

820
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,569
- Sometimes, too close.
- How was school?

821
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,406
You have some fun?

822
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,325
Good times?

823
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:27,955
Hey, do you like bear claws?
Picked some up at the bakery today.

824
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:29,540
They're yummy.

825
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,959
- What now?
- His claws.

826
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,878
They've all been... clipped.

827
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,508
No chance.

828
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,929
Oh, do you bowl? You ever been bowling?

829
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,181
I could take you bowling,
give you some tips.

830
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,022
Hey, Timmy, you know, I know,
it's weird I'm dating your mom.

831
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,317
It's weird that you want to give me
tips on bowling.

832
00:53:58,986 --> 00:53:59,987
Fair enough.

833
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:03,176
I... I just want you to know though,
that I... really like her.

834
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:07,619
She's so smart, and cool,
and funny, and pretty.

835
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:11,457
I'm actually kinda surprised
she likes spending time with me.

836
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,792
Not that I am a bad guy at all.

837
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,211
I'm not, I just got
some stuff I'm working out.

838
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,131
Even been going to therapy,
which is going great.

839
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,551
I just feel like people think
because we issue tickets

840
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:27,473
that meter maids don't care.
But we do... care a lot.

841
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,850
About everything, I'm not robot.

842
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,582
- Hmm.
- Actually, I've been thinking

843
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,897
about robots a lot lately.
About how they could take over everything.

844
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,108
You know, Timmy.
When someone opens up like that...

845
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,791
to you, like, then you can say something.

846
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,906
- Like what?
- Oh, like,

847
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,394
you know, "Thank you for sharing,"
something like that.

848
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,995
- Thank you for sharing.
- Yeah, that's a normal thing to do.

849
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,707
- Normal's for normal people.
- What does that mean?

850
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:57,586
It means you're normal.
And my mother doesn't like normal people.

851
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,965
Okay. Okay.

852
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,767
So, first of all, just so you know,
I'm not that normal.

853
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,478
I'm a nice parking enforcement officer,
which is rare.

854
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:18,774
And, secondly, what you said,
that was kind of mean.

855
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,777
- I've never been mean to you.
- Yes, you have.

856
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,529
What? When?

857
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,532
- You just kidnapped me for starters.
- Oh!

858
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,742
You dis... No, I didn't kidnap you, buddy.

859
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,370
No this isn't... I'm just taking you home
from school.

860
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,860
You can get out any time you want.

861
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,623
I never forced you to...

862
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,583
Timmy, oh!

863
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:39,878
Timmy!

864
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,172
Oh, no. Come on, buddy!

865
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,302
Having thwarted
an attempted kidnapping,

866
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:51,557
I sequestered myself in my office,
to focus on the Jenkins case.

867
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,646
- Hey.
- Hello, Mother.

868
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,066
Doing your homework, that's great.

869
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,986
Case work. New client.

870
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,744
So, I heard what happened today
with Crispin.

871
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,205
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Negative.

872
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,127
Timmy, I know it's not easy for you
having someone new around,

873
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,378
but I really like Crispin.

874
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,840
He's... he's a sweet guy
and we have fun together.

875
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,552
Like yesterday, we just went for a drive.
It was nice.

876
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,855
I hope you're not doing anything foolish.

877
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,734
No. No, no, I'm not. I'm... I promise.

878
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:51,491
Timmy, I got to talk to you
about something else. It's important.

879
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,621
We gotta move, Timmy.

880
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,374
- Impossible.
- No, it's not.

881
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,753
They're raising our rent again,
and I just... I can't afford it.

882
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,671
What about my office?

883
00:57:05,394 --> 00:57:07,219
You... Well, you'll have to
make a new one.

884
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,717
I can't do that!

885
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,251
I have a very heavy case load,

886
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,824
- this is not a good time for me.
- But we don't have a choice.

887
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,057
And besides,
I found a nice apartment nearby,

888
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,600
and you can still walk to school.

889
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,880
What does school have to do
with any of this?

890
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:22,397
- I'm talking about my agency!
- Timmy, I know it's not easy...

891
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,901
I can't just move my business
at the drop of a hat.

892
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,033
Not to mention, I'll have to make
new business cards. These are useless.

893
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,823
- I'm not moving. It's out of the question!
- Timmy.

894
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,577
Note to file, do not hire Mother.
Unreliable.

895
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,294
No one but my bear understood
the pressure I was under.

896
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,923
Not my mother... not my peers.

897
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,970
They all failed to realize
the true value of my agency.

898
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:58,850
If they did, I would be spared
such profoundly annoying disruptions.

899
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,229
Like moving. And class trips.

900
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,775
- Failure.
- Hello, Mr. Crocus.

901
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:12,364
I want you to listen to me very carefully,
I don't want any trouble from you today.

902
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,242
One misstep, and you're suspended.

903
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:19,037
No judge, no jury. No hope.

904
00:58:19,635 --> 00:58:20,635
Capisce?

905
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:25,585
- What does "capisce" mean?
- It means, understand?

906
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,213
I capisce you.

907
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:34,219
Hey, there it is! Look, the dam.

908
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:37,723
The Bonneville Lock and Dam
is a national historic landmark.

909
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,768
Construction on it began in 1933.

910
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,939
These turbines
generate 1200 megawatts of power.

911
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:50,902
That is enough electricity
to power 900,000 homes...

912
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,155
or a city the size of Portland.

913
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,573
Cool.

914
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,242
Any questions?

915
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,412
- Yes?
- Do you have security at this site?

916
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:05,876
Security? Yeah. Your bus stopped
at our guard station on the way in.

917
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,670
- Is that it?
- Well...

918
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,965
I'm afraid I can't discuss that
too far in depth,

919
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,842
for, well, security reasons.

920
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,304
Why is she so concerned with security?

921
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,515
My dad says his two fists
are the only security we need.

922
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:22,893
My grandma bought a huge dog.

923
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,104
- It can maul an intruder.
- Oh.

924
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:28,440
Have you heard
about the purse snatchings?

925
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,918
I have, I saw it on the news.

926
00:59:31,993 --> 00:59:36,114
Mouths shut! Or I'm putting you all
on the bus back home.

927
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:39,785
- Is that really an option?
- Not for you, Failure.

928
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,370
You're gonna stay here till I retire.

929
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:48,126
Another interesting fact
about this dam is it was built

930
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,337
- during the Great Depression.
- Oh, no.

931
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,130
That was when
people needed jobs...

932
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,466
She's executing the master plan.

933
01:00:11,046 --> 01:00:12,776
Three, two, one.

934
01:00:13,391 --> 01:00:14,861
I'm in the dark here, guys.

935
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,365
Rollo, I need help.

936
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,909
No, I quit. Leave me alone.

937
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,287
The Russians want to destroy
our way of life.

938
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,583
- They're gonna plunge us into darkness.
- I'm not worried about our way of life.

939
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,752
I'm worried about saving my grade.

940
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,965
Do this, and I promise to study.

941
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,804
- Swear?
- Swear on my bear.

942
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,688
Let's go, let's go. Keep moving,
keep moving, keep moving.

943
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:53,942
- Let's go.
- Mr. Crocus, I just wanted to say

944
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,487
I find field trips like this
to be very helpful in my development.

945
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,534
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. I'm just being appreciative.

946
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:07,038
Well, if by appreciative you mean odd,
then I agree. Now, go. Go.

947
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,083
Hey, kid. Stop right there!

948
01:01:14,196 --> 01:01:15,226
Failure.

949
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:26,349
Corrina!

950
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,693
Corrina!

951
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,699
Where is that runt?

952
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,492
There he is.

953
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:53,585
Where is she?

954
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:00,759
Corrina!

955
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,556
- Where is Timmy?
- I don't know.

956
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,814
Failure?

957
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,449
Papa Bear, Papa Bear.
I've lost the target.

958
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,077
Request back up.

959
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,787
Do you copy?

960
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,790
Repeat. Do you copy?

961
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,669
That's a demerit.

962
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,765
That's a lot of doors.

963
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,774
I'm gonna kill him.

964
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,953
The target has entered
the restricted area. I'm going in.

965
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:12,789
Failure! Get over here, you little rat.

966
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,666
I'm warning you.

967
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,712
If you go through that door,
I guarantee you'll never make it

968
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,005
to sixth grade.

969
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,552
For the love of...

970
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,304
Whoa!

971
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,234
Corrina!

972
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:48,033
Echo!

973
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,999
Next time, I'm keeping him on a leash.

974
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:02,714
Huh!

975
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:08,303
- Failure, get back in here. Now.
- Can't. Stuck.

976
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,472
So, unstick it.

977
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:16,227
- Still stuck.
- Take it off and leave it there.

978
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:17,979
It's one of a kind.

979
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,286
This is the final straw, Failure.

980
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,581
No more threats, no more detention.

981
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:41,086
I gave 43 years to this profession

982
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,963
and I never quit on a single student.

983
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,842
But I'm quitting on you, did you hear me?

984
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:50,136
I am quitting on you, Failure.

985
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:51,971
This is Dan.

986
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:55,934
He's gonna open up the spillway
and release a whole lot of water.

987
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:57,644
Cover your ears.

988
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,605
It's about to get very loud.

989
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,360
Oh, no!

990
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,739
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

991
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,243
- Take off the scarf, take it off!
- Never!

992
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,620
We're going to die!

993
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:17,372
My scarf!

994
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,625
- You ripped it!
- Go. Go. Go!

995
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,425
- Locked.
- What?

996
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,802
No! No!

997
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:34,597
Here comes the water! Get down!

998
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:38,143
- Why?
- 'Cause we're gonna get washed away!

999
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:42,480
- What are you doing?
- Saving you.

1000
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,280
We were two professionals,
often at odds.

1001
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,866
Now bound by adversity.

1002
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,869
But we had made one miscalculation.

1003
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,455
Water. Us.

1004
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,879
I think it's over, Mr. Crocus.

1005
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,175
Mr. Crocus?

1006
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,304
Are you all right, Mr. Crocus?

1007
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,976
The aftermath of the operation
was complicated.

1008
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,521
First, they debriefed my mother
on the Russian plot.

1009
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:27,317
- Then she debriefed her boss.
- Come on, I need this job, man.

1010
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,533
But the operation
was so top secret...

1011
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,828
that my mother didn't want to debrief me.

1012
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,083
Until we got home.

1013
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:50,089
You're suspended for three days,
Timmy, three days.

1014
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,217
They wanted to expel you.

1015
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:56,638
If your counselor hadn't stepped in,
then we'd be looking for a new school.

1016
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,265
- Are you listening to me?
- Of course.

1017
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:01,417
But, shouldn't you be returning
to work, Mother?

1018
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,938
Yeah, I should. But I'm not.
And do you wanna know why?

1019
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,607
Because when I told my boss
that I had to stay home

1020
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,692
and take care of you
for the next three days,

1021
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,071
he told me not to bother
coming in at all. He fired me.

1022
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,865
I can pay you ten times what he's paying.

1023
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:19,035
No, you can't. This... this has to stop.

1024
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:22,830
- You're going to middle school next year.
- No, I'm not.

1025
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:27,377
I'm not going to middle school.
I am moving my agency downtown.

1026
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,273
We've talked about this.

1027
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,590
You don't have an agency, Timmy.
Not anymore.

1028
01:07:41,655 --> 01:07:42,850
What are you doing?

1029
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,614
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1030
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:48,106
I'm putting an end to all this pretending.
I'm shutting it all down.

1031
01:07:48,195 --> 01:07:49,195
- Stop!
- No!

1032
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,485
You have got to understand
that there are consequences.

1033
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:57,323
Hey! That's my official license.
I need that.

1034
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,659
- I have open cases.
- No, you don't. You're a kid.

1035
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,327
Kids don't have open cases.

1036
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,621
I can't operate my agency
without a license.

1037
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,624
Exactly! You're gonna stop
running your agency,

1038
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,918
you're gonna start acting
like a normal kid.

1039
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:12,005
And normal is for normal people,
you told me that.

1040
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,382
I was wrong! I was wrong, Timmy!

1041
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:18,803
You have got to fit in,
you've got to grow up.

1042
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:21,973
Do you understand?

1043
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:26,102
- Affirmative.
- I didn't hear you!

1044
01:08:29,764 --> 01:08:30,932
Yes.

1045
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,785
And just like that...

1046
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,537
I lost my agency.

1047
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,002
That meant no more clients.

1048
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,214
No more office.

1049
01:08:58,176 --> 01:08:59,344
No more house.

1050
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:09,520
A man without his agency
is like a turtle without his shell.

1051
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,115
Stripped of his place...

1052
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,582
and his purpose...

1053
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,414
destined for mediocrity.

1054
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,797
Thus, I had no choice
but to surrender to my fate.

1055
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,804
The mindless monotony
of the normal life.

1056
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,351
- Hey, Timmy.
- Welcome back, Timmy.

1057
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,148
- Where's your scarf?
- Hi, everyone.

1058
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,109
- Hi, Corrina.
- Hello.

1059
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,736
- Hi.
- Good morning, everyone.

1060
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,197
So sorry I'm late.
My alarm clock didn't go off.

1061
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,532
Can you believe it?

1062
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,117
Crocus is gone.

1063
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:07,954
- That’s his replacement.
- She said he's on vacation.

1064
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,290
But I think it's because of what happened
with you at the dam.

1065
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,960
My dad said Crocus snapped.

1066
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,923
Adding insult to injury,
the loss of Fredrick Crocus.

1067
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,552
A man I deeply admired.

1068
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,514
Timmy, I'm home.

1069
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,683
- Hey.
- Hi.

1070
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,894
- How was school?
- Good.

1071
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:34,856
Got any homework?

1072
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:36,733
I did it.

1073
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,443
Oh?
Good.

1074
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,668
I'll get dinner ready then.

1075
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,574
Okay.

1076
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,244
Timmy...

1077
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:50,830
everything’s gonna be all right.

1078
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,624
I even found a new job.

1079
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:55,710
Okay.

1080
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,379
The good news
about Mother's new job

1081
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:03,926
should've lifted my spirits.

1082
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,929
But as her employment fortunes rose...

1083
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,056
my continued to fall.

1084
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,185
With no clients and no agency,

1085
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,772
I had no choice
but to lay off my only employee.

1086
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:22,779
So Total and I agreed to part ways
as two professionals.

1087
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:55,978
But sometimes,
the professional can sure feel personal.

1088
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,406
And being normal can sure feel lonely.

1089
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:14,121
Not to mention puzzling.

1090
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,547
Hi, Timmy, wanna buy cookies
to support Animal Awareness?

1091
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:24,841
I don't have any money.

1092
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,010
Just take one. They're really good.

1093
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,642
You gonna eat that cookie
or just stare at it?

1094
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,978
I'm not hungry.

1095
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,698
I got your intel. It's very good.

1096
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:53,035
- But why'd you miss our meeting?
- I don't need to go anymore.

1097
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,954
I'm being normal now.

1098
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,081
Got it.

1099
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:58,958
So, what's the plan?

1100
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:01,752
Go to middle school.

1101
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,712
Act like them.

1102
01:13:05,895 --> 01:13:07,337
You can't be like them.

1103
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:08,945
Why not?

1104
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,178
Because you're different.

1105
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,558
That's right. Your life is big...

1106
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:20,646
and original, and weird, and you.

1107
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,525
I don't have a choice.

1108
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:26,986
I had to close the agency.

1109
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,239
That's a bad break.

1110
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:33,341
I suppose it had something to do
with the dam, getting suspended.

1111
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:38,039
- Mistakes were made.
- By you.

1112
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,961
You left that part out.
Agency or no agency,

1113
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,255
you make a mistake, you own it.

1114
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,050
Then you learn from it and adapt.

1115
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,928
- Adapt?
- Absolutely.

1116
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:55,431
You see, professionals take
whatever the world throws at them

1117
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,017
and they use it to become
a better version of themselves.

1118
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,519
Like I did when my car got stolen.

1119
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:02,688
That's right.

1120
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,982
From right in front of my house.
Sucked.

1121
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,985
You should've contacted my agency.

1122
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,029
I didn't know you then.

1123
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,489
The point is,

1124
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:14,450
after the car got stolen
I had no way to get to work.

1125
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,369
But I love my work.

1126
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,955
Like you. It's who I am.

1127
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,624
So I adapted.

1128
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,085
Started riding my bike to school.

1129
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,421
Wasn't gonna let a stolen car stop me.

1130
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,300
And I lost ten pounds
from bike riding so...

1131
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,177
it's all good.

1132
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,306
- You lost ten pounds?
- Yes, I lost ten pounds.

1133
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,061
So, I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your business, okay?

1134
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:45,523
But I do know, if you love what you do...

1135
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,525
you gotta fight for it.

1136
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,281
And if something isn't working,
you gotta adapt.

1137
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,238
You do that,

1138
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:56,242
then no one can take away your agency.
Not your mother, not Mr. Crocus.

1139
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:58,953
Not going to middle school.

1140
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,505
Enjoy your cookie.

1141
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:26,731
A wire?

1142
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:36,865
And that's when it hit me.

1143
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:39,958
Russians never quit.

1144
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,871
And neither could I.

1145
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,015
That meant I was going to need my partner.

1146
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,196
But retrieving Total was a daunting task.

1147
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,908
Which meant it was time to collaborate
with local law enforcement.

1148
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,077
Even if it was low level.

1149
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,411
Stay safe out there, Roy.

1150
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,796
- Hello.
- Hey, Timmy.

1151
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,716
You scared me. Everything all right?

1152
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,039
Would I be standing here if it was?

1153
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,472
No, guess not. Uh, is it about your mom?

1154
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,225
Negative. About the zoo.

1155
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,393
I need admission. It's urgent.

1156
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,438
Okay. Why?

1157
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,488
Hey, man, you can trust me. Really.

1158
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,406
I'm a solid dude.

1159
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,121
A Russian agent stole the Failure Mobile,

1160
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,833
so she could destroy my agency
and achieve her master plan.

1161
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:12,128
That forced me to part ways
with my business partner.

1162
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:13,921
I want him back.

1163
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,591
- And he's at the zoo?
- Correct.

1164
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,220
He's a polar bear.

1165
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:24,098
Are you serious?

1166
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:29,186
Okay. Well, first of all,
thank you for sharing.

1167
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,521
I really appreciate it.

1168
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,941
Second of all, that is awesome.

1169
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:37,862
Affirmative.

1170
01:17:39,177 --> 01:17:41,448
Here are your tickets.
Please enjoy the zoo.

1171
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,617
All right,
where is the polar bear enclosure?

1172
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,996
It is right here, but it's closed.

1173
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,582
- How come?
- Renovations.

1174
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:53,210
- Where are the polar bears?
- Utah. Hogle Zoo.

1175
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,754
- Utah.
- Absurd.

1176
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,299
- It's not absurd.
- It is, too.

1177
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:00,050
- You're absurd.
- Hey, hey.

1178
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,011
Just right there, buddy.

1179
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:04,136
He's just a kid,
and he's really upset all right?

1180
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:05,472
But he's a rude kid, so...

1181
01:18:05,756 --> 01:18:08,926
Well, he's just under the impression
that his partner is at this zoo.

1182
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:11,705
Let me get some clarity on that situation
and we'll figure this out, all right?

1183
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:12,938
Hang tight. Timmy...

1184
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,232
Timmy?

1185
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,068
Timmy!

1186
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,787
Papa Bear, Papa Bear.
Operation Extract is in full effect.

1187
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,700
Papa Bear, it's time to come home.

1188
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,955
Repeat, it's time to come home.

1189
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,124
Papa Bear?

1190
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,546
Total!

1191
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:25,844
Total!

1192
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:29,556
Total?

1193
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:51,287
Total!

1194
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,870
Last time I saw him,
we were at the ticket booth.

1195
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,077
He... he’s about this height,
he’s got brown hair,

1196
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,538
he’s wearing shorts,
a striped t-shirt and...

1197
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:35,789
Red scarf.

1198
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,625
- Timmy, are you okay?
- Affirmative.

1199
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,627
- Where did you go?
- To find my bear.

1200
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:44,006
- And?
- Liberated.

1201
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,343
Right on.

1202
01:20:55,464 --> 01:20:59,085
- Ah, it's your mom calling.
- Throw it away, it might be tapped.

1203
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,060
I'll call her back when we park.

1204
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:03,650
And, Timmy,
thanks for letting me help, man.

1205
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,820
Really. It means a lot that you
trusted me, I want you to know that.

1206
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:09,281
Thank you for sharing.

1207
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,450
- Ha!
- Stop!

1208
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:17,373
Hey!

1209
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,542
He took my purse! Hey!

1210
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:22,669
That was the purse snatcher.

1211
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,172
- I know.
- Shouldn't you stop him?

1212
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:28,759
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I guess I should, yeah, okay.

1213
01:21:34,954 --> 01:21:37,279
- He went down that alley!
- Okay, okay. I got it!

1214
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,649
- There he goes.
- Okay, okay. I got it.

1215
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,068
Wait here. Don't move.

1216
01:22:05,659 --> 01:22:07,589
- Freeze, man.
- Who are you?

1217
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,216
- Police.
- You're a cop?

1218
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,553
- Parking enforcement.
- You're a meter maid.

1219
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,972
Okay. Just hand over the purse, buddy.

1220
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:19,435
- Sure. Here you go.
- Thank you.

1221
01:22:20,975 --> 01:22:23,188
I really appreciate you doing
the right thing here, man.

1222
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:26,233
Thanks. But I am actually gonna
do the wrong thing.

1223
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,488
Uh-oh!

1224
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:33,740
Get off me!

1225
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,037
He needs backup.

1226
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:48,589
- What is your problem?
- No one likes a meter maid, dude.

1227
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:51,311
I know. I'm trying to change that
though by engaging in a...

1228
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:53,886
No one cares!

1229
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,180
Here we go. Hang on.

1230
01:23:06,165 --> 01:23:07,232
Here comes backup.

1231
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,617
Timmy!

1232
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,752
Prepare for impact!

1233
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:18,804
Mistakes were made.

1234
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:22,349
But not today.

1235
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,935
Today, I would act like a professional.

1236
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:26,812
A real professional.

1237
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,606
And let local law enforcement
do their job.

1238
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,069
You, in the truck.

1239
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,113
I can't get by.

1240
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:41,785
Move you and your big, fat dog
out of my way.

1241
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,248
So I did.

1242
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:48,584
And it hurt.

1243
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:01,388
Timmy! Hi! Hi, are you okay?
Tell me you're okay.

1244
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:04,182
- I'm okay.
- You're okay? Okay.

1245
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:06,935
- He's okay?
- He's okay and he's very lucky.

1246
01:25:07,424 --> 01:25:09,304
- I'll give you two a moment.
- Okay. Thank you.

1247
01:25:10,594 --> 01:25:13,874
I'm sorry it took me so long to get here.
I came here as soon as Crispin called me.

1248
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,361
- Where's Crispin?
- Talking to the police.

1249
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:20,032
- We apprehended the purse snatcher.
- You did? That's good.

1250
01:25:20,879 --> 01:25:22,959
Oh, God! I'm just...
I'm just happy that you're safe.

1251
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,494
I thought that something...

1252
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,999
I thought something bad
had happened to you.

1253
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,419
And they didn't... they didn't tell me
what happened.

1254
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:33,629
So, I... I didn't know...

1255
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:37,049
- Oh. God!
- I'm sorry.

1256
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:41,803
You... you are?

1257
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:45,682
Yes. I was just trying to get
my agency back.

1258
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:47,559
I need it.

1259
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,542
Especially if I have to go
to middle school.

1260
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:09,956
I want you to have your agency back.

1261
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,168
- But you said...
- I know what I said.

1262
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,091
I was upset, I made a mistake.

1263
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,301
You did?

1264
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:23,470
Yeah.

1265
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,933
Yeah. I make... I make lots of them.

1266
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,227
So do I.

1267
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:33,605
Well...

1268
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,297
we are both going to do better.

1269
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,319
- Together, okay?
- Affirmative.

1270
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,448
Excuse me.

1271
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:49,579
Note to file. Reconsider hiring Mom.

1272
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:03,510
- Hello.
- Geez. Hey!

1273
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:06,430
Timmy! How are you doing, buddy?

1274
01:27:07,203 --> 01:27:08,723
I'm here on professional matters.

1275
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:16,148
Rally for Animal Awareness Month.
Right on!

1276
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,526
- I'll try to come.
- I could use the backup.

1277
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:22,487
Hey, you know what?
I stumbled upon something

1278
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,531
you might be interested in. It's...

1279
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,743
It's Russia related.

1280
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,039
My mother will be at the rally,
for your information.

1281
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:34,166
Oh, yeah?

1282
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,376
- She still mad at me?
- Affirmative.

1283
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,088
- But the ice is breaking.
- Yeah. I really screwed up.

1284
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:43,365
- Mistakes were made.
- Yeah. Story of my life.

1285
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:44,726
Mine too.

1286
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,389
It was illegally parked.

1287
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:51,433
Impossible.

1288
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:54,311
- Did you tell my mother?
- No.

1289
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,271
I just saw it this morning
during inventory.

1290
01:27:57,002 --> 01:27:58,302
How do you want to play it?

1291
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,528
Note to file. Possible police collusion
with the Russians.

1292
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:12,329
The crimes were piling up.
Gunnar's backpack, A dead hamster,

1293
01:28:12,552 --> 01:28:13,772
and double-dealing cops.

1294
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:16,917
But was I surprised? Negative.

1295
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,835
After all, this was Portland.

1296
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:22,214
Stumptown. A place rife with crime...

1297
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,383
corruption, and Russians.

1298
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:40,899
Thank you to the Carverette Elementary
Student Teacher Band.

1299
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:43,485
And thank you all for being here today.

1300
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:47,739
Our young activists worked very hard
to put this all together.

1301
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:49,115
And I'm damn proud of them.

1302
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:50,867
And you should be, too.

1303
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,328
I'm serious.

1304
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:54,830
Clap.

1305
01:28:58,417 --> 01:28:59,418
Good.

1306
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:03,880
Now, welcome our student organizer,
Molly Moskins.

1307
01:29:07,124 --> 01:29:08,218
Yes, Molly!

1308
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:11,555
- Where's Timmy?
- I don't see him.

1309
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:14,057
- Thank you.
- Or my Segway, for that matter.

1310
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,142
- Oh, yeah.
- Welcome, everyone.

1311
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:17,394
- What?
- Nothing.

1312
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:21,523
We, the students
of Carverette Elementary School,

1313
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:26,695
urge you to join us in celebrating
the glory that is the animal world,

1314
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:29,948
in our commitment
to wildlife conservation.

1315
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:34,369
We dedicate this rally
to our late class hamster,

1316
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:36,246
the beloved Hammy Ham.

1317
01:29:36,567 --> 01:29:38,248
May his soul rest in peace.

1318
01:29:40,356 --> 01:29:45,046
And now, please welcome to the stage,
Timmy Failure.

1319
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:46,965
No.

1320
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,801
There's Timmy. And he has your Segway.

1321
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:54,631
He does.

1322
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,693
Greetings, fellow humans.

1323
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,032
Oh, boy.

1324
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:18,163
Please be advised that this school
has a "no polar bear" policy on campus.

1325
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,373
That is not just.

1326
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,083
I'm gonna kill him.

1327
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,878
You're the one who told him
to stand up and be heard.

1328
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,007
A polar bear may be different.
He may be lazy.

1329
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:33,345
He may eat garbage
and he may have a poor attitude.

1330
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:37,223
But, he is also a vulnerable species

1331
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,225
and worth protecting.

1332
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:46,858
For a polar bear is loyal, and noble,
and capable of greatness.

1333
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:53,365
In fact, all of the animals in this rally
are capable of greatness.

1334
01:30:58,078 --> 01:31:00,413
- Right on.
- Oh, he's so delicious.

1335
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:04,459
So, it may be time for us to move on
to middle school.

1336
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,213
It may be time for us to adapt
to a new way of life.

1337
01:31:08,852 --> 01:31:12,425
But it will never be time for us
to stop being us.

1338
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:20,016
You can tell that to our parents,
you can tell that to our teachers,

1339
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,162
and you can tell that to the Russians.

1340
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:25,647
Go, Timmy!

1341
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,819
God bless Carverette Elementary,
God bless Portland,

1342
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,488
and God bless Fredrick Crocus!

1343
01:32:00,847 --> 01:32:03,047
It was a moment
of unmitigated triumph.

1344
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,066
I only wish that Fredrick Crocus,

1345
01:32:10,722 --> 01:32:13,695
an educator unrivaled,
could have been here to witness it.

1346
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,999
But then I knew why he wasn't.

1347
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:33,006
Save me!

1348
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,585
She was plotting more evil...

1349
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:45,935
and we would be there to stop it.

1350
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:59,616
There's a man who leads a life of danger

1351
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:05,663
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger

1352
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:12,337
With every move he makes
Another chance he takes

1353
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:17,050
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

1354
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:24,265
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1355
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:30,021
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

1356
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:39,364
Beware of pretty faces that you find

1357
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:46,579
A pretty face can hide an evil mind

1358
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:52,836
Ah, be careful what you say
Or you'll give yourself away

1359
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:57,757
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow

1360
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:04,973
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1361
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:10,937
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

1362
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:45,847
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1363
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:51,561
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

1364
01:34:57,066 --> 01:35:01,112
Swingin' on the Riviera one day

1365
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:07,785
And then layin' in the Bombay alley
Next day

1366
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:14,542
Oh no, you let the wrong word slip
While kissing persuasive lips

1367
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:19,005
The odds are you won't live
To see tomorrow

1368
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:26,387
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1369
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:32,310
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

1370
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,656
Secret agent man
