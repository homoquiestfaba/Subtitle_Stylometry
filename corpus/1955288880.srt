1
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,640
Fiona.

2
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,275
Fiona.

3
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,813
Falling asleep?

4
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:48,647
No.

5
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,215
I think you are.

6
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,183
No.

7
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,518
-Are you sure?
-I am.

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,485
Are you sure?

9
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,054
I'm sure.

10
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:58,657
My stomach's gonna start
growling any second now.

11
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,159
I think you're falling asleep.

12
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,493
I'm not falling asleep.

13
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:03,695
Don't start.

14
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,064
What?
Start what?

15
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,231
--What?

16
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,266
What did I start?

17
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,467
-This.
-What did I star?

18
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,301
This.

19
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,438
Stop it.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,443
Stop.
Stop it!

21
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:18,710
What?

22
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:19,478
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,112
It's not fair.

24
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:21,380
What?

25
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,815
Because you're not--
you're not ticklish.

26
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:23,649
It's not fair.

27
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:24,650
Oh, sorry.

28
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:27,619
Mm.

29
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,621
Stop!

30
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,593
--Don't
make fun of me.

31
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,596
Don't go away, yo.

32
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,198
Ok?

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,399
K.

34
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,200
K?

35
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,551
One new message.

36
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,322
Fiona, it's Juan.

37
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,690
Where are you?

38
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,658
I just tried your cell phone.

39
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,628
Uh, I don't know what
you want me to do.

40
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,929
I'm gonna go ahead
and start the meeting.

41
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:51,863
Come late if you can.
Call me.

42
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,272
Hey.

43
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,573
This is Fiona.

44
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,941
Leave a message, and
I'll get back to you.

45
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:03,742
Thanks.

46
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,752
Sherwin, it's me.

47
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,587
I think you're right.

48
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,790
I should go see my mom
before it's too late.

49
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,026
I'll call you on my home.

50
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:21,827
Love you.

51
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,817
Fiona?

52
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,718
Hi.

53
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,855
Is this sherwin Owens?

54
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,356
Yeah, who's this?

55
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,925
You
live at 21 long Avenue?

56
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,627
Yeah, I do.

57
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,397
This is officer holson, the
Atlanta police department.

58
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,399
We sent an officer
by twice today

59
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,767
to get in contact with you.

60
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,771
Uh, what is this concerning?

61
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,773
I'm
sorry to tell you

62
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,742
this over the phone, Mr.
Owens, but your wife was

63
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,344
involved in a traffic accident.

64
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,713
And it was a fatal accident.

65
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,093
Mr. Owens, you're still here?

66
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,095
Would you like to
speak to someone, sir?

67
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:34,666
We can send an officer
by immediately.

68
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:40,072
--Can--
can you-- can you please--

69
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:45,777
can you please, um-- can
you help-- but can you--

70
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,134
hey, this is Fiona.

71
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:09,968
Leave a message.

72
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:35,787
Hi, uh, mr Owens?

73
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,055
Yeah.

74
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,692
Uh, John Scott from
Lincoln crematorium.

75
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,932
May I come in?

76
00:07:56,075 --> 00:08:00,111
I-- I know how difficult
it must be to come to us.

77
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,681
So I am happy to
bring her to you.

78
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,954
Thank you.

79
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,690
I'm very sorry for your loss.

80
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,892
Mr Owens?

81
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,994
I need you to sign.

82
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,162
Hello, sunshine.

83
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,904
Sherwin.

84
00:08:58,906 --> 00:08:59,871
Get up.

85
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,079
Sherwin.

86
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,148
Get up.

87
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,983
Sherwin, come on.

88
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:12,984
Get up.

89
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,294
What are you doing here?

90
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,101
Shouldn't you be at work?

91
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:30,902
Yeah.

92
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,077
Dammit.

93
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,754
P, seriously, can you--

94
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,755
yes.

95
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,057
There we go.

96
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,326
Oh. You need to stop
smoking and drinking.

97
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,293
It's disgusting.

98
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,962
And you stink.

99
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,697
Come eat.

100
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,999
I don't know what would
make you think I want to eat.

101
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,301
Because you haven't
in I don't know how long.

102
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,643
What are you gonna
do about the service?

103
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,378
Seriously, p, I know
you're trying to help,

104
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,913
but you-- you just need to--

105
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,848
I'm getting
15 calls a day.

106
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,283
Well, tell them to get a life.

107
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,719
There's no fucking way.

108
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,620
All right.

109
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,623
I will take care of it.

110
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:27,859
Just let it go.
Let it go.

111
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:28,693
Just let it ring.

112
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,229
You've
reached sherwin and Fiona.

113
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,097
Please leave a message.

114
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,200
It's lucina.

115
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,401
It's her mom.

116
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,103
I wanted to see

117
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,105
if you might like to come
up here to Maine for a bit.

118
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,007
I though it might
do us some good.

119
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,377
No need to call.

120
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,683
There is nothing
you could have done.

121
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,818
Course there is.

122
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,886
No.

123
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,921
You did not put her in that car.

124
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,823
I was supposed to
take care of her.

125
00:10:58,825 --> 00:10:59,991
And you did.

126
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,827
How can you say that?

127
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,762
And then missing her.

128
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:07,899
You have the food.

129
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,371
And there's no reason to
call Fiona's mom back.

130
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,708
I'll deal with her.

131
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,943
Call me if you need me.

132
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:19,911
I love you.

133
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,285
Everything is
harder than it is.

134
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,953
Should we go see her?

135
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,095
I don't know.

136
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,429
She tried to destroy us.

137
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,067
We're strong.

138
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,886
Come on.

139
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,326
Go see your uncle.

140
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,927
Go.

141
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,041
What are
you doing here?

142
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,410
Mom said you wanted to play.

143
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,211
Did she?

144
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:20,431
I've got a-- I've got a cold.

145
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,102
You swapped these.

146
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,136
No, I didn't.

147
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,872
So why-- where am I?

148
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:28,973
Click start.

149
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:29,974
I just clicked start.

150
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,343
No, you didn't.

151
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,813
You're crazy.

152
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:35,446
Whatever.

153
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,981
I still win.

154
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,882
Oh, you're right.

155
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,288
Oh.

156
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,455
Can you get out of the way?

157
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,323
Really, mom?

158
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,324
Give me a second.

159
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,358
Give me a second.

160
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,560
Cleaning up after you.

161
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:49,394
What happened?

162
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,863
Hey, that's-- can I?

163
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,097
No, you don't need this.

164
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:53,998
P.

165
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Yes?

166
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,503
Have some apples.

167
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,505
What, you start the
game and not tell me?

168
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,979
Mom said not to talk
about auntie Fiona.

169
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,284
That's ok.

170
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,359
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,332
Thanks, Jamal.

172
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,673
Sherwin?

173
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,608
Hi.

174
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,575
Hi.

175
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,144
I'm Ann, Lucinda's nurse.

176
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,345
Oh, nice to meet you.

177
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,547
Nice to meet you, too.

178
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,548
Come in, please.

179
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,516
Thank you.

180
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,593
Lucinda is expecting you.

181
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,295
Um, but she's resting now.

182
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,596
So she'll see you at dinner.

183
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,098
Ok.

184
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,699
I-- I'll show you to your room.

185
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,179
Yes, just up here.

186
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,285
There's a bathroom right
there to your left.

187
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,288
And there are clean
towels in there for you.

188
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,422
Ok.

189
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,458
I need to get
back to Lucinda.

190
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,693
If you need anything,
just let me know.

191
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:16,527
Thank you.

192
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,328
Ok.

193
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,229
Oh, hey.

194
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:58,930
Finding everything ok?

195
00:19:58,932 --> 00:19:59,897
Yeah.

196
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,934
Uh, is anything to drink?

197
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,502
Course.

198
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,503
Wine or whiskey?

199
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,637
Uh, whiskey would be great.

200
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,471
Whiskey?

201
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,973
Great.

202
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:09,941
Here you go.

203
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:10,741
Perfect.

204
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:14,579
You gonna have one?

205
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,748
Uh, no, thank you.

206
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,583
I'm so sorry.

207
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,557
Thank you.

208
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,460
As you know, she was just
here, and it was really

209
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,628
good to finally meet her.

210
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,966
Did you like her?

211
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,535
Very much.

212
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,803
Yeah, me, too.

213
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,940
No one should lose a child.

214
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,311
Or a wife.

215
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,012
Of course.

216
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,696
What is that on the,
um-- on the island

217
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,832
that I can see from upstairs?

218
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,700
Oh, that's the lighthouse.

219
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,270
It has a great story, too.

220
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:12,903
What, the lighthouse?

221
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:13,704
Mhm.

222
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,611
You gonna tell me the story?

223
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,885
Um, well, the lighthouse
is on an island,

224
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:31,756
and the caretaker was lonely,
so he married this young girl

225
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,358
and brought her over with him.

226
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,927
But when she had been there
for a while, she looked at him

227
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,865
and said, there's nothing to do.

228
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,301
So he brought her a piano.

229
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,604
But when the boat came
with the instrument,

230
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:49,640
it only had one sheet of music.

231
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,310
And she played and
played and played

232
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:57,748
that same song over and over
again until he went mad.

233
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,919
He chopped the piano with
an ax, chopped her head off,

234
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,853
and then killed himself.

235
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,658
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,094
Was that inappropriate?

237
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:10,895
Shit.

238
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,101
I don't know why I said that.

239
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,002
No, it's ok.

240
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,566
Hello, Mrs. Wright.

241
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,801
Hi.

242
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:24,869
Please, have a seat.

243
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,107
Thank you.

244
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:30,908
You're welcome.

245
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,153
Here we are.

246
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,495
This looks very nice.

247
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,632
I'm surprised you came.

248
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:55,466
Me, too.

249
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,136
Me, too.

250
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,644
How was your drive?

251
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,179
Oh, fine.

252
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,652
Actually, everything's
excruciating right now.

253
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:18,923
I'm barely myself.

254
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,769
She was just here,
and she was fine.

255
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,175
Fine?

256
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,544
Mm.

257
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:42,580
So what happened?

258
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,120
Um, well, from
what I was told, she

259
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,857
was in traffic changing lanes--

260
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,792
I know that.

261
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,128
I read what happened.

262
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:58,996
Oh, I see.

263
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,534
I don't believe it.

264
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:13,577
--We sang
karaoke the night before.

265
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,612
Was she drunk?

266
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,646
No.

267
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,547
It was the middle of the day.

268
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,681
She was a good driver.

269
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,885
Not that day.

270
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:23,754
What was different?

271
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,523
I don't know.

272
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,156
It was raining.

273
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:26,991
She was rushing.

274
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,159
Why?

275
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,729
It was an accident.

276
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:33,631
Excuse me.

277
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,536
Would you like to eat with us?

278
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,837
No, thank you.

279
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,105
I need to get to the
store before it closes.

280
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,841
Do you need anything?

281
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:44,975
No, thank you.

282
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,211
Well, you
look very tired.

283
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,748
Maybe she should get
you some sleeping pills.

284
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,749
No.

285
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:52,850
That's ok.

286
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:53,651
Ok.

287
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,226
Ann is very good.

288
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,794
She does more than she should.

289
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,966
Sometimes.

290
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:09,767
All the time.

291
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:28,586
I've done
all right up till now.

292
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:32,356
It's the light of day
that shows me how.

293
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:34,925
And when the night falls.

294
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:35,960
Be serious.

295
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:36,927
My loneliness calls.

296
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:42,232
Oh, i
wanna dance with somebody.

297
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,189
You were great.

298
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,023
You were great.

299
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,026
Baby.

300
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,132
Suzy, could I get another
gin and tonic, please?

301
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,067
What are you doing?

302
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,102
Seriously?

303
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,269
Why are you drinking so much?

304
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,638
I thought we were having fun.

305
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,872
We are having fun.

306
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,174
But I just don't understand.

307
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,242
What, fun?

308
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,710
Oh, come on, Fiona.

309
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:27,878
Just leave it.

310
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,912
Why are you
drinking so much when

311
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:29,680
we're trying to get pregnant?

312
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,651
If I'm drinking
right now, I guess

313
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:36,020
I'm not trying to get pregnant,
not thinking about it.

314
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,851
How is he today?

315
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,053
Tired.

316
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:11,789
He should have flown.

317
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,924
He's stubborn.

318
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,260
What makes you say that?

319
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:18,128
He seems kind.

320
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,930
He wants something.

321
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:22,966
Like what?

322
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,069
Didn't you invite him?

323
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,437
Yes.

324
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,039
Yes.

325
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,407
But I didn't think he'd come.

326
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,865
Shit.

327
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,371
I hadn't seen her in so long.

328
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,272
And i--

329
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,440
Fiona, stop.

330
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,442
Stop.

331
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,244
Can we just talk about us?

332
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:41,512
Sherwin, what's the point?

333
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:42,546
Because you're
confusing things,

334
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,482
and you're confusing me.

335
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:46,950
I can't.

336
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,218
I thought
we talked about this.

337
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,288
Didn't we have a plan?

338
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,025
It's-- it's-- it's--
better like this.

339
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:55,859
For who?

340
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,094
Please.

341
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:57,995
It's not
better for me, baby.

342
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,029
Sherwin.

343
00:29:59,031 --> 00:29:59,930
I wanna be a father.

344
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:00,531
Please.

345
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,590
What are you afraid of?

346
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,096
What are you afraid of?

347
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:39,536
I'm afraid of making
a child feel unwanted.

348
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,604
But you wouldn't.

349
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,605
You don't know that,

350
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:43,006
baby, I do.

351
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,909
She's the only mother
i know, sherwin.

352
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,279
You are being
so selfish right now.

353
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,034
Is he friendly?

354
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,235
Yeah.
She's good.

355
00:33:58,237 --> 00:33:59,136
She's all right.

356
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:02,172
She won't do anything.

357
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,106
Hi.

358
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,341
What's his name?

359
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,175
Tammy.

360
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,109
That's her name.

361
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:06,743
Hey.

362
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:07,677
Hey, Tammy.

363
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:11,648
She's a good dog.

364
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,482
Hi.

365
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,084
Sherwin.

366
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:16,520
Uncle George.

367
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,488
It's good of you to come.

368
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,656
I can't imagine it's easy.

369
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,402
It's a horrible thing.

370
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,641
You meant a lot to her.

371
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:48,652
She tell you we went fishing?

372
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,587
She hated fishing.

373
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,790
Well, she probably just
wanted to get out on the lake.

374
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,759
And to get away
from her mother.

375
00:34:55,761 --> 00:35:01,598
Well, they-- if you ask me,
they're both a little dramatic.

376
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,735
It's wild here.

377
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,337
You think?

378
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,171
Yeah.

379
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,806
Huh.

380
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:10,607
It's home.

381
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,679
Look what I just hung.

382
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,714
Nice.

383
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,618
That's gonna drive
Lucinda crazy.

384
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,887
I hope she can hear it.

385
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:27,424
From her bedroom
and think about me.

386
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,507
How is she today?

387
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:47,644
She's-- never great
in the morning.

388
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:52,616
Oh, um-- she would like
to have lunch with you.

389
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,585
Would you mind
eating in her room?

390
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,254
Is that what she wants?

391
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:57,854
I think so.

392
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,193
What?

393
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:04,928
That's weird.

394
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,795
Is it?

395
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,931
In her room?

396
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,866
Is egg salad ok?

397
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,168
Oh, I make a mean egg salad.

398
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,238
You sure?

399
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,540
What, that my egg salad's good?

400
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,375
No, i-- um.

401
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,643
Great.

402
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,345
Um, I'll let you know
when she's ready.

403
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,680
All right.

404
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,481
Thank you.

405
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,432
Come in.

406
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,509
Ann said you made lunch.

407
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:55,445
I don't remember
hearing that you cook.

408
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,413
They're just sandwiches.

409
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,318
Where were you?

410
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,354
Uh, I went for a
walk down to the lake.

411
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,355
Um, I should have changed.

412
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:05,956
I'm sorry.

413
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,860
It's
beautiful down there.

414
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:11,661
Yeah.

415
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,734
Um.

416
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,302
Do you-- do you mind if i--

417
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,670
no, no, no.

418
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:27,611
Yeah, it's very, uh--
it's very quiet down there.

419
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,279
How many people live here?

420
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,014
In the town?

421
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,515
Not many.

422
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:33,950
Yeah, I can tell.

423
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:37,254
You don't mind
being so isolated?

424
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,989
I don't think of it that way.

425
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:41,424
It's peaceful.

426
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,293
What do you do all day?

427
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:44,961
Right now I'm trying
to eat my lunch.

428
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,603
I always liked
swimming down there.

429
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,042
Fiona always
preferred the ocean.

430
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,444
I never understood it.

431
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,313
It's punishingly cold.

432
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,514
Yeah, she loved the water.

433
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:05,315
Yeah.

434
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,592
I haven't run an
obituary here yet.

435
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:18,728
I was wondering if
you'd like to write it.

436
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,297
My sister sent one from Atlanta.

437
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:20,930
Did you get it?

438
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,866
Probably.

439
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,968
There's been too much mail.

440
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,570
Well, you can modify that.

441
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,339
Do you want to
take it down to the paper?

442
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:29,939
No.

443
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,851
Um, I, uh, found this
just before I left.

444
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,557
Oh.

445
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,725
Darling.

446
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,328
She never talked
about cheerleading.

447
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,797
She was only a cheerleader
for a little while.

448
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:57,767
That's probably why she
didn't mention it to you.

449
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:02,439
And she became embarrassed, you
know, when she found feminism.

450
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,418
I, uh-- met George.

451
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,688
He's a
pain but attentive.

452
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,957
Thank god he shaved that beard.

453
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,892
He looked like a troll.

454
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:28,665
--Did you
tell him to shave it?

455
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:32,102
I let him know it
wasn't attractive.

456
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:35,071
He has a nice face.

457
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:37,040
Did he tell you the joke?

458
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,709
No, he didn't, uh-- he
didn't tell any jokes.

459
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,077
Do you wanna hear it?

460
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,879
Sure.

461
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,782
George is from here, you know.

462
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:46,916
Ok.

463
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:51,154
Well, there was this man.

464
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,590
We'll call him bill.

465
00:39:53,592 --> 00:40:01,398
And he moved here from another
state when he was an infant.

466
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,033
Let's say New Hampshire.

467
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,870
And he lived to be 93.

468
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:15,078
And when he died, his tombstone
read, "almost a mainer."

469
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,879
That's it.

470
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,150
Huh.

471
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:29,726
--It's
George's one joke.

472
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,829
It's funny.

473
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,497
I don't
know about that.

474
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,172
I hate pickles.

475
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:45,675
Of course, you'd have no way
of knowing that, would you?

476
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:46,876
Uh, no.

477
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:47,977
Can I get you something else?

478
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:55,552
Maybe cup of coffee in a bit.

479
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:56,519
Thank you.

480
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:07,831
Oh, I'd like dinner to be nice.

481
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,631
Sure.

482
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,047
We didn't need him.

483
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,015
Oh, it's exhausting.

484
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,021
Need anything?

485
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,023
I think I'd
like a cup of coffee.

486
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,856
Hey.

487
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,959
I was beginning to worry
you had gotten lost.

488
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:24,233
I, uh-- I noticed you almost
finished yours, so, um--

489
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,735
you didn't need to do that.

490
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:27,103
Thank you.

491
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,105
Want a drink?

492
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,974
Ok.

493
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,642
How do you take it?

494
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:33,376
Um, I don't know.

495
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:34,777
How do you take it?

496
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:39,048
Uh, usually straight.

497
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:39,849
Drink every day?

498
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:45,989
Cheers.

499
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:46,789
Cheers.

500
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,095
Ooh.

501
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:54,697
So, uh, what are we
making for dinner?

502
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:55,665
No, no, no.

503
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,734
You-- you've done enough.

504
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,168
What else am I doing?

505
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,038
Ok.

506
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,406
George brought over some fish.

507
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,380
I think he scaled them, but
they need to be cleaned.

508
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:12,215
Oh.

509
00:44:12,217 --> 00:44:13,950
Ok.

510
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:17,286
We just open them up, gut them.

511
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,287
Wait, am I doing this?

512
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:21,290
Yes, you are.

513
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,095
You'll be fine.

514
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:26,896
Outside.

515
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,387
Ann, can I get a plate, please?

516
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:52,221
Ok!

517
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:02,699
Thank you.

518
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,172
Oh, not bad for a city boy.

519
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:09,972
Ugh.

520
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:13,376
Ok.

521
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,377
Ugh.

522
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,178
So heavy.

523
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,092
Hey, sherwin.

524
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:32,328
Look at that.

525
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,329
Did you make it?

526
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:36,065
Oh, no, I'm not that nice.

527
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,434
A neighbor heard that
we have a special guest,

528
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:41,304
and she made it just for you.

529
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:42,305
Is it safe to eat?

530
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,521
What happened when
Fiona was here?

531
00:45:58,523 --> 00:45:59,355
Ooh, honey.

532
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,029
They fought a lot.

533
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,905
She meant well,
but it's complicated.

534
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:18,474
Lucinda had been
through chemo, and Fiona

535
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,376
wasn't here to see that.

536
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:24,313
It's hard to tell
how sick she is.

537
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:26,082
She's sick.

538
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:27,150
How sick?

539
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:30,486
She has a lot of pain.

540
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,355
She's tough.

541
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:38,895
But Fiona, she didn't--
excuse my language--

542
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:41,063
take any of Lucinda's shit.

543
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:43,399
She was really upset
when she came home.

544
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,134
Yeah.

545
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:50,406
Well, I imagine she knew
she'd never see her mom again.

546
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,808
How would she know that?

547
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,810
She knew.

548
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:54,410
You know.

549
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,917
I'm sure Lucinda knew, too.

550
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,988
She just thought
it would be her.

551
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:27,176
It was thoughtful of
you to get some wine.

552
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,846
It's the same bottle Fiona
bought when she was here.

553
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:31,981
She said it was the only
decent wine they had.

554
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:34,016
Well, that's true.

555
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,117
I guess you shared taste.

556
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,489
That's what happens.

557
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:43,159
So you seem to, uh, have
a good support system

558
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:46,395
here with Ann and George.

559
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:49,465
Paid help is hardly support.

560
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,368
And my brother-in-law just
wants to get into my bed.

561
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,207
Do you doubt it?

562
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,280
I-- no.

563
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:06,616
But, uh, at least
you're not alone.

564
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:08,451
I've been alone
since Fiona left.

565
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:21,330
I just don't know why she
always had to be so tight.

566
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,571
So in control.

567
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:29,639
Control of what?

568
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:30,640
Everything.

569
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:32,508
She always had to have her way.

570
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,910
She was a strong woman.

571
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:35,144
But it's not that.

572
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:39,181
It's her rigidity.

573
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,617
Maybe she acted that
way when she felt threatened.

574
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,453
Is my cancer threatening?

575
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:47,590
She even wanted to control that.

576
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:50,126
Can't remember the last
time I saw her relaxed.

577
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:51,961
Well, when was the last
time you were relaxed?

578
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:53,262
Well, I'm barely alive.

579
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,398
There must be something
relaxed about that.

580
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:02,972
Lucinda.

581
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,177
What?

582
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,979
Is there any way
i can help you?

583
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,362
This might make you smile.

584
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:29,165
I, uh-- I found this upstairs.

585
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:36,672
Um-- there is--
yeah, right here,

586
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,474
this-- this part right here.

587
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,012
My eyes
aren't too good.

588
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:44,146
Will you read it?

589
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,550
Oh, yeah, of course.

590
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:53,089
"Mommy made us lunch, and Shane
said, where's the bathroom?

591
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,357
Oh, never mind.

592
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,025
It was just gas."

593
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,635
When did
she write that?

594
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,571
Oh, she was probably five.

595
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:12,541
Mm.

596
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,481
She said she was
trying to get pregnant.

597
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,452
She told you that?

598
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:39,502
Parenthood brings out
the best in people.

599
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:41,804
And the worst.

600
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,146
She took
so much with her.

601
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,059
I'm sorry.

602
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:04,787
Lucinda?

603
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,595
Lucinda?

604
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,746
Lucin-- Lucinda!

605
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:33,315
Are you ok?

606
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,683
Lucinda!

607
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:37,686
Can you hear me?

608
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,922
Lucinda.

609
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:41,257
It's gonna be ok, ok?

610
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,258
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

611
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:42,892
All right?

612
00:52:42,894 --> 00:52:43,893
Oh!

613
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:45,361
Stay away from the hospital!

614
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:46,195
Stay!

615
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:47,329
Stay away!
-Ok, ok.

616
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,230
Stay!

617
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:49,832
Away from the hospital!

618
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:50,699
Ok.

619
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:51,534
Listen, are you hurt?

620
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:52,902
Are you hurt?

621
00:52:52,904 --> 00:52:54,904
Are you hurt?

622
00:52:54,906 --> 00:52:57,640
Let's get you on the bed.

623
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:59,875
Lucinda.

624
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:00,709
Oh, Ann!

625
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,577
What?

626
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:02,411
Ann!

627
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:03,245
She left.

628
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:03,913
Ann left.

629
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:04,880
Ann, god.

630
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:06,282
Oh, god, please!

631
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:08,284
Oh!

632
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,285
Oh, god!

633
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:09,952
Lucinda.

634
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:11,453
Oh!

635
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:12,288
Oh!

636
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,289
Ok.

637
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:14,290
Oh!

638
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:15,291
Ok.

639
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:18,294
Oh, god.

640
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:20,563
Ok, I'm-- no.

641
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:22,731
What are you--
what are you doing?

642
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,707
Please!

643
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,309
Don't leave me!

644
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,311
Please don't leave me!

645
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,680
Oh, please don't leave me!

646
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:39,682
Please don't leave me.

647
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:41,283
Oh, please.

648
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:43,686
Oh!

649
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:51,660
Ann hello?

650
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:54,263
Ann?

651
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:56,665
Ann, i-- I need your help.

652
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,267
Ok.

653
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:01,270
She's-- she's hysterical.

654
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:03,272
Um,
there's a bottle

655
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:06,642
of valium on top of the shelf
right next to or in a vase.

656
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:10,246
Give her one and
she'll calm down.

657
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:11,247
Did you find it?

658
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:12,248
Yeah.

659
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,515
Yeah, I've got it.

660
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:14,650
I'll be right over.

661
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:15,651
Try to get some sleep.

662
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:17,653
Ok.

663
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:20,022
Ann!

664
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:20,990
Come back!

665
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,468
Oh!

666
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,491
Traveling so fucking long.

667
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:16,758
We're gonna have
to cut the pant leg.

668
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,027
Ok.

669
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:21,497
What happened?

670
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,632
I was shot at.

671
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,767
Shit.

672
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:26,869
It's open season.

673
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:28,871
I am so sorry.

674
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:30,672
Careful, please.

675
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:31,874
All right.

676
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:34,877
It's just a bad scrape.

677
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,147
I see why she hated this place.

678
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,058
I'm exhausted.

679
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,263
How you feeling?

680
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,201
You'll be ok.

681
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,769
It'll look bad
for a couple days.

682
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,571
But you'll be fine.

683
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:06,141
Think you can hobble over and
have some tea with Lucinda?

684
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:09,244
What, now?

685
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:11,179
She's worried about you.

686
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,015
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

687
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:24,626
Yes?

688
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:30,065
Ann said you wanted to see me.

689
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,869
You should always be careful
when running in the country.

690
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:37,606
Well, I'm not gonna be
running again anytime soon.

691
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:38,240
Here.

692
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,141
Sit down.

693
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:40,042
No, no.

694
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,243
I'm gonna rest upstairs.

695
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,744
Please.
-No, honestly, I'm fine.

696
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:43,679
Just hand me
the pillow, please.

697
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:47,282
Give me the pillow.

698
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:51,820
There you go.

699
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,265
How does it feel?

700
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,833
It-- it really hurts.

701
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:05,767
It's throbbing.

702
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,009
Ann said I got
you up last night.

703
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:14,810
Yeah.

704
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,315
Are you ok?

705
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,651
I feel-- strange.

706
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,256
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

707
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:29,791
As long as you're ok.

708
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:36,231
What are you planning
to do with her ashes?

709
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,700
Lucinda, please.

710
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:42,704
Well, we don't want to
have a double funeral.

711
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:44,906
I will tell you when
i make up my mind.

712
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,908
We have a plot
next to her father.

713
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,344
Well, she didn't
want to be buried.

714
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:52,681
Oh, I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

715
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:54,850
She always wanted to
be next to her father.

716
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:56,685
I didn't bring her ashes.

717
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:59,021
Ok?

718
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:00,656
I'm gonna go rest upstairs.

719
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,190
The house smells like smoke.

720
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:11,827
I was smoking on the porch.

721
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:14,029
Not a good time to
pick up old habits.

722
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,366
Thanks for the advice.

723
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,514
Want some salad?

724
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:33,315
Please.

725
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:41,923
We could use real plates,
even if it's just sandwiches.

726
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,760
Ann didn't want to do dishes.

727
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:45,393
More?

728
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:46,795
Uh-uh.

729
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:49,965
Thank you.

730
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,399
Your leg seems better.

731
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:52,768
You're not limping around.

732
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:55,864
You should, uh, go
in the living room,

733
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:58,066
be more comfortable.

734
01:03:58,068 --> 01:04:01,970
I was just on my way.

735
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,505
Stop smoking in my house.

736
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:19,888
Thank you.

737
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:20,555
Thank you.

738
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,280
This sandwich wasn't half bad.

739
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,321
Sorry, what?

740
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:59,261
I just said the
sandwich was fine.

741
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:02,397
That's good.

742
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:06,635
You really should get
some sleeping pills.

743
01:05:06,637 --> 01:05:09,404
You look like you
haven't slept in ages.

744
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:12,107
Well, my wife just died.

745
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:14,276
My child died.

746
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:16,144
My child.

747
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:18,046
I know that.

748
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:19,180
Why do you act so pious?

749
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,117
It's pathetic.

750
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,923
It's a good thing you
never had children.

751
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:29,958
Oh, I'm sure you think that.

752
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,692
You would.

753
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:35,063
Don't presume to know me.

754
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:37,933
I can see why she
never came here.

755
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:38,633
Oh?

756
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:40,468
She just did.

757
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:41,636
Look how that turned out.

758
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:42,504
That wasn't my fault.

759
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:43,338
No?

760
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,472
No.

761
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:46,942
I saw how she came
back from here.

762
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:48,176
That was you.

763
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,446
How dare you.

764
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:52,314
Liar.

765
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:53,949
Excuse me?

766
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:57,118
I found her ashes.

767
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,719
So what?

768
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,124
Why did you come here?

769
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:10,398
Trying to see what
she was hiding from?

770
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,503
The truth is she just
wanted to be different.

771
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:18,206
She spent her whole life trying.

772
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:23,578
And you-- you were just another
way to make her feel special.

773
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,680
She always needed
to feel so special.

774
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:32,620
You could have been anyone.

775
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,369
Hi.

776
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,370
Sherwin?

777
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:03,371
Hey.

778
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:04,772
You forget about me?

779
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:05,807
No.

780
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,343
You forget to call your sister?

781
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:10,345
All right.

782
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:11,346
You ok?

783
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:12,747
Yeah, I'm fine.

784
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:14,349
I'm coming home.

785
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:15,717
Thank god.

786
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:17,318
I've been worried about you.

787
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,319
Yeah.

788
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,420
I'll call you when I'm back.

789
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:20,455
All right.

790
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:21,256
Drive safe.

791
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:24,352
Lucinda.

792
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,225
Lucinda.

793
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:31,826
Morning.

794
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:34,929
It's afternoon, I think.

795
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:36,231
You must be hungry.

796
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:39,567
I-- I brought you a Danish.

797
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:57,885
How did you get here?

798
01:10:57,887 --> 01:10:59,687
Ann drove me.

799
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:03,358
Took me all morning to
convince her to leave me,

800
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,559
she shouldn't have.

801
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:05,994
Oh, I get my way, too.

802
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:06,794
Sometimes.

803
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,868
I needed to see you
before you left.

804
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:19,641
Ok.

805
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,812
Can I take you home?

806
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:25,813
I'm pretty cold.

807
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,521
I brought a photo to show you.

808
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,398
That's Carl, my
husband, holding Fiona.

809
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,970
I was so young when I met him.

810
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,342
You would have liked him.

811
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:55,543
He was smart, too.

812
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,384
I put my life on
hold after Carl.

813
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:04,352
You don't have to do that.

814
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:12,660
Fiona hated me for
the life I chose.

815
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,395
She certainly wouldn't
want it for you.

816
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:18,833
I'm not sure it's that easy.

817
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,401
No.

818
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:22,337
No.

819
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:25,640
It's not.

820
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:26,974
I couldn't do it.

821
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,747
But you?

822
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:35,083
You try.

823
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:37,011
It should
have been me, not Fiona!

824
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,163
I don't regret coming.

825
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,201
No?

826
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:34,001
No.
