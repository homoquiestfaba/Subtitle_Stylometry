Baby, I've been texting my dad.

1220
01:18:05,186 --> 01:18:06,287
We talk.

1221
01:18:08,122 --> 01:18:10,191
Mainly because I needed
closure for myself.

1222
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,361
That's good.

1223
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:21,168
I asked him to meet me here.

1224
01:18:21,202 --> 01:18:23,938
Baby, I think
you two should talk.

1225
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:27,942
- Talk about what, baby?
- Your mom.

1226
01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:31,011
Baby, to heal,
you have to be able

1227
01:18:31,045 --> 01:18:32,647
to face those who scarred you.

1228
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:35,950
And even though he scarred me,

1229
01:18:35,983 --> 01:18:37,885
he has some unknown answers

1230
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:39,954
that he could
probably help you with.

1231
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:42,089
That man
can't help me with shit.

1232
01:18:45,192 --> 01:18:46,493
Baby, I forgave him.

1233
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:49,830
Can you just try it for me?

1234
01:18:51,165 --> 01:18:52,066
Please?

1235
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:56,370
Please.

1236
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:01,075
Hey, Daddy.

1237
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,482
I'm gonna
let you two talk, okay?

1238
01:19:08,516 --> 01:19:09,684
Baby, I'll be in the car.

1239
01:19:22,597 --> 01:19:23,497
I'm sorry, Jerome.

1240
01:19:25,332 --> 01:19:28,902
Us parents don't
always get it right.

1241
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:31,573
Some do.

1242
01:19:31,606 --> 01:19:32,507
Some don't.

1243
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:37,545
Shit. If I'm
going to be honest,

1244
01:19:38,345 --> 01:19:40,147
it has taken me some 30 years

1245
01:19:41,415 --> 01:19:43,217
and I'm still learning
how to be a father.

1246
01:19:47,354 --> 01:19:49,658
But one thing I do know
about your mother,

1247
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,426
she is a fighter.

1248
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:54,629
Come on, man. Stop
talking about my mother, man.

1249
01:19:57,264 --> 01:19:58,399
A fighter just like you.

1250
01:20:02,136 --> 01:20:05,139
I'm working on having a
better relationship with Rayven

1251
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:08,610
and hope that includes you too.

1252
01:20:11,078 --> 01:20:13,814
My baby girl, she loves you.

1253
01:20:15,949 --> 01:20:17,652
And love is hard to come by.

1254
01:20:20,454 --> 01:20:21,556
Take it from me.

1255
01:20:32,534 --> 01:20:33,735
What's this, man?

1256
01:20:34,868 --> 01:20:37,304
It's the address
where your mother is.

1257
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:41,475
Come on, man, you come over
here to talk about my mother, yo?

1258
01:20:42,242 --> 01:20:43,444
My mother's dead. All right?

1259
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,517
Your mother's not dead.

1260
01:20:51,385 --> 01:20:52,319
Go see her.

1261
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:28,055
RAYVEN: You got everything?

1262
01:21:28,088 --> 01:21:31,559
Yeah. What the hell
you got in these bags?

1263
01:21:31,593 --> 01:21:32,627
We're going to New York, right?

1264
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:36,564
Remind me to change my shoes

1265
01:21:36,598 --> 01:21:38,198
- before I get out the car.
- All right.

1266
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:43,337
Jerome, I love you.

1267
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,405
Girl, get in the car.

1268
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:46,974
- Jerome, I love you.
- I love you, too.

1269
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,861
Which house is it?

1270
01:22:06,895 --> 01:22:09,096
It's this one right here.

1271
01:22:09,129 --> 01:22:10,565
You sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

1272
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:12,667
I'm sure.

1273
01:22:13,233 --> 01:22:14,368
Okay.

1274
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:16,103
I'll be right here
when you get back.

1275
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:17,037
All right.

1276
01:22:42,996 --> 01:22:43,997
SHEILA: Who at my door?

1277
01:22:53,675 --> 01:22:55,309
Oh, my God.

1278
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:58,145
- Jerome, hey, baby.
- Don't touch me!

1279
01:22:59,012 --> 01:23:00,481
Well, you wanna come in?

1280
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:02,382
No, I don't wanna come inside.

1281
01:23:02,416 --> 01:23:05,620
Now, Jerome, you listen here.

1282
01:23:05,653 --> 01:23:07,087
You need to lower your voice.

1283
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,322
No, you listen to me.

1284
01:23:10,658 --> 01:23:12,527
How could you just
leave me like that?

1285
01:23:14,461 --> 01:23:16,798
All these years I'm out here
searching for somebody

1286
01:23:16,831 --> 01:23:18,800
who killed you,
and you're alive.

1287
01:23:21,034 --> 01:23:23,470
Did you even think
about searching for me?

1288
01:23:23,504 --> 01:23:24,539
I'm sorry.

1289
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:28,510
- I wasn't there.
- [INAUDIBLE]

1290
01:23:30,477 --> 01:23:31,746
But I thought of you, though.

1291
01:23:31,779 --> 01:23:35,048
You... [SCOFFS]
You thought of me?

1292
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:41,188
Why? Can you answer that? Why?

1293
01:23:42,356 --> 01:23:45,259
I wasn't well, Jerome.

1294
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:49,129
I couldn't take care of you. I
couldn't take care of myself.

1295
01:23:49,162 --> 01:23:52,466
I wasn't good for myself,
for you, and nobody else.

1296
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,969
You gotta understand.

1297
01:23:57,805 --> 01:23:58,640
I couldn't do it.

1298
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,577
You don't know what
I've been going through.

1299
01:24:03,811 --> 01:24:05,013
You don't know how I feel.

1300
01:24:07,715 --> 01:24:10,518
That is not a good enough
answer for me.

1301
01:24:15,255 --> 01:24:16,189
Thank you, though.

1302
01:24:18,927 --> 01:24:21,428
- Thank you for nothing.
- Jerome...

1303
01:24:23,031 --> 01:24:24,866
Jerome, now you
get back here right now.
