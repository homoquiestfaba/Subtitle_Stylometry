00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,320
<i> For the rain ... it raineth every day </ i></i>

<i> For Messaline, with this country,

23
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,120
What country, friends, is this?

24
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
This is Illyria, lady.

25
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And what should I do in Illyria?

26
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My brother ...

27
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
he is in Elysium.

28
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,960
Perchance he is not drown'd ?

29
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
My Lady Viola ... It is perchance
that  yourself were saved.

30
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,440
My poor brother!

31
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,000
Sebastian!

32
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,200
The war between their kingdom and ours
Too often has led to bloody arguments

33
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,200
We must not be discovered
in this place

34
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,400
Who governs here?
-The Duke. Orsino

35
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,840
Orsino?

36
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,640
I heard my father name him

37
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,200
he was a bachelor then.
- So he is now. Or was so very late.

38
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,960
It is said no woman
may approach his court

39
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,400
but from one month ago 'twas fresh in murmur
that he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

40
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,120
What's she?
-That's her! Olivia!

41
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,200
Daughter of a Count who
died some twelve months since

42
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,000
Her brother has lately also died.

43
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,040
And in her grief, it is said she has abjured
the sight and company of men.

44
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,840
O that I served that lady

45
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,480
That were hard to compass;
Because she will admit no kind of suit,

46
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,880
No, not the duke's.

47
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,600
I prithee...

48
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,520
...Be my aid. For such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent.

49
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,120
I'll serve this duke:
Thou shall present me as a boy to him:

50
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,560
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing

51
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,880
And speak to him in many sorts of music

52
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,560
That will allow me very worth his service.

53
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,600
Oh, I thank thee!

54
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,400
TWELFTH NIGHT

55
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,200
TWELFTH NIGHT or
WHAT YOU WILL.

56
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
If music be the food of love, play on;

57
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,000
Give me ... excess of it

58
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,400
... surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken, and so ...

59
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,520
... die.

60
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,680
That strain again!

61
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,080
it had a dying fall:

62
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,440
O, it came o'er my ear
like the sweet sound,

63
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,560
That breathes upon a bank of violets,

64
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,160
Stealing and giving odour!

65
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,080
Enough;

66
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,400
no more!

67
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,280
'Tis not so sweet now
as it was before.

68
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,400
How now! ... what news of Olivia?
-So please my lord, I might not be admitted;

69
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,200
But from her handmaid do return this answer:

70
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,560
<i>"The element itself, till seven years' heat,
Shall not behold her face at ample view;"</i>

71
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,320
<i>"But, like a cloistress..."</i>

72
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,400
<i>"... all this to season a brother's dead love, which she would
keep fresh and lasting in her sad remembrance."</i>

73
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,480
O, she that hath a heart
of that fine frame

74
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,000
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,

75
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,800
My Lord Orsino ...

76
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,400
Here comes the Count!

77
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,880
-Who saw Cesario, ho?
-On your attendance, my lord; here.

78
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,200
Cesario ...

79
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,440
Thou know'st no less but all;

80
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,840
I have unclasp'd
to thee the book even of my secret soul:

81
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,080
Therefore, good youth,
address thy gait unto her;

82
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,120
Stand at her doors, and tell them : there
thy fixed foot shall grow till thou have audience.

83
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,120
Sure, my noble lord, if she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
as it is spoke, she never will admit me.

84
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,400
Be clamorous
and leap all civil bounds!

85
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,260
Say I do speak with her, my lord,
what then?

86
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,800
Then unfold
the passion of my love,

87
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,360
It shall become thee well
to act my woes;

88
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,620
She will attend it better in thy youth
- I think not so, my Lord.

89
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:35,521
Dear lad, believe it;

90
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:39,022
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
That say thou art a man:

91
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
Diana's lip
Is not more smooth and rubious;

92
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,760
thy small pipe Is as the maiden's organ,
shrill and sound,

93
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,600
And all is semblative a woman's part.

94
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,800
I know thy constellation is right apt
For this affair.

95
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,840
Some three or four : attend him.

96
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,840
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in
earlier o' nights

97
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,400
That quaffing and drinking
will undo you

98
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,520
I heard my lady
talk of it yesterday

99
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,880
and of a foolish knight that you brought in
one night here to be her wooer.

100
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,800
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
- Ay, he.

101
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,800
- He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
- What's that to the purpose?

102
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year. and speaks
three or four languages word for word without book !

103
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,480
he's a fool and a he's great quareller.

104
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,480
and but that he hath the gift of a coward
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.

105
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,240
Sir Toby Belch!

106
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,880
Sir Andrew Agueface !

107
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,760
- How now, Sir Toby Belch!
- Sweet Sir Andrew!

108
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,720
God Bless you, fair shrew.

109
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,400
-And you too, sir.
- What's that?

110
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,040
- My niece's chambermaid.
- oh good Mistress Accost...

111
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,520
- I desire better acquaintance.
-My name is Mary.

112
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,280
Good Mistress Mary Accost,--

113
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,760
'accost' is front her, board her,

114
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,520
woo her, assail her.

115
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,000
Fare you well, gentlemen.

116
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,200
Is that the meaning of "accost"?

117
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,960
O knight when did I
see thee so put down?

118
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,600
What a plague means my niece,
to take the death of her brother thus?

119
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,720
I am sure care's
an enemy to life.

120
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,680
I ride home tomorrow, Sir Tobias.

121
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,000
"Pourquoi",  my dear boy?
-What is  "pourquoi" ?

122
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,800
Do or not do ?

123
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,280
I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues
that I have in fencing and dancing !

124
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,400
O, had I but followed the arts!

125
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,040
I am going home tomorrow.
your niece will not be seen.

126
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,960
or if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me:
the count himself here hard by woos her.

127
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,800
She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
her degree,  I have heard her swear't.

128
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,600
Tut, there's life in't,man.

129
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,520
I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
strangest mind in the world;

130
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,320
I delight in masques and revels
sometimes altogether.

131
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,360
- Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
- Faith, I can cut a caper.

132
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
And I think I have the back-trick simply
as strong as any man in Illyria.

133
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,400
Wherefore are these things hid?

134
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,200
wherefore have
these gifts a curtain before 'em?

135
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,800
why dost thou not go to church
in a galliard and come home...

136
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,240
...  in a coranto?

137
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,280
Is it a world to hide virtues in?

138
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,040
- My lady will hang thee for thy absence.
- Let her hang me: I fear no colours.

139
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,440
- I can tell thee where that saying was born.
- Where, good Mistress Mary?

140
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,800
In the war.

141
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,280
Well, God give them wisdom
that have it;

142
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,560
and those that are fools,
let them use their talents.

143
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,240
- You are resolute, then?
- I am resolved on two points ...

144
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,480
That if one break, the other will hold;
or, if both break, your breeches fall.

145
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,560
If Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.

146
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,600
Peace, you rogue,

147
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,280
no more o' that.

148
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
- God bless thee, lady!
- Take the fool away...

149
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,800
- Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
- I'll no more of you: besides, you grow dishonest.

150
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,960
bid the dishonest man mend himself;
if he mend, he is no longer dishonest

151
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,480
if he cannot, let the
botcher mend him !

152
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,920
Any thing that's mended
is but patched...

153
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,640
virtue that transgresses
is but patched with sin;

154
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,040
and sin that amends
is but patched with virtue.

155
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,600
As there is no true cuckold but
calamity, so beauty's a flower.

156
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
The lady bade take away the fool;
therefore, I say again, take her away.

157
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,440
Sir, I bade them take away you.

158
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,360
Misprision in the highest degree!
Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.

159
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,440
- Can you do it?
- Dexterously, good madonna.

160
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,840
Make your proof.

161
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,400
I must catechise you for it, madonna.

162
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,480
Good my mouse
of virtue, answer me.

163
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,280
Well, sir, for want
of other idleness,

164
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,200
Good madonna,
why mournest thou?

165
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Good fool, for my
brother's death.

166
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,200
- I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
- I know his soul is in heaven, fool.

167
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,040
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for
your brother's soul being in heaven.

168
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,440
Take away the fool, gentlemen.

169
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,080
What think you of this fool, Malvolio?
Doth he not mend?

170
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,600
Yes, and shall do till
the pangs of death shake him:

171
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,720
infirmity, that decays the wise,
doth ever make the better fool.

172
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,720
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity,
for the better increasing your folly!

173
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,800
How say you to that,
gentle Malvolio?

174
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,360
I marvel your ladyship takes delight
in such a barren rascal...

175
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,600
Look you now, he's out
of his guard already.

176
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,640
unless you laugh and minister occasion
to him, he is gagged.

177
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,600
Oh, you are sick of
self-love, Malvolio,

178
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,040
and taste with a
distempered appetite.

179
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,080
there is no slander in an allowed fool,
though he do nothing but rail...

180
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,120
nor no railing in a known discreet man,
though he do nothing but reprove.

181
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,640
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman
much  desires to speak with you.

182
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
- From the Count Orsino, is it?
- I know not, madam.

183
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,240
- Who of my people hold him in delay?
- Sir Toby.

184
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,840
- he speaks nothing but madman.
- Go you, Malvolio.

185
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,440
if it be a suit from the count, I am sick,
or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.

186
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,040
Now you see, sir,
how your fooling grows old...

187
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,360
... and people dislike it.

188
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,200
Thou hast spoke for us, madonna,
as if thy eldest son should be a fool

189
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,520
whose skull Jove cram with brains! for, here he comes,
one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.

190
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,920
By mine honour, half drunk.

191
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
What is he at the gate, cousin?

192
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,880
A gentleman.

193
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,160
What gentleman?
-T´is a gentleman ...

194
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,320
a plague o' these pickle-herring!

195
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,640
- How now, sot !
- Good Sir Tobias!  ...!

196
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,920
Cousin, cousin, how have you come
so early by this lethargy?

197
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Lechery! I defy lechery.

198
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,320
- There's one at the gate.
- Ay, marry, what is he?

199
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,040
Let him be the devil,
an he will, I care not

200
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,440
Give me faith, say I.

201
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,080
Well, it's all one.

202
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,800
-  What's a drunken man like ?
- Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man...

203
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,600
one draught above heat makes him a fool;
the second mads him;

204
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,760
and a third drowns him.

205
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,040
Go thou and seek the crowner,

206
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,920
he's drowned ...

207
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,560
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.
I told him you were sick; I told him you were asleep

208
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,120
- Tell him he shall not speak with me.
- Has been told so

209
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,400
and he says, he'll stand at your door like a
sheriff's post, but he'll speak with you.

210
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,840
- What kind o' man is he?
- Why, of mankind.

211
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,360
- What manner of man?
- Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.

212
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,680
- Of what personage and years is he?
- Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy

213
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,200
one would think his mother's milk
were scarce out of him.

214
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,240
Let him approach:
call in my gentlewoman.

215
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,480
Gentlewoman...

216
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,120
my lady calls.

217
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,520
We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.

218
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,120
Give me my veil.

219
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,280
Well ... The honourable lady of the house ...

220
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,040
...  which is she ?

221
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,120
Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
Your will?

222
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,160
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatched beauty, ...

223
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:24,640
pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her.
I would be loath to cast away my speech.  I have taken great pains to learn it.

224
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,640
Whence came you, sir?

225
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,640
that question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,

226
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,080
- Are you a comedian?
- No, my profound heart!

227
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,440
- Are you the lady of the house?
- I am.

228
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,800
- I will on with my speech in your praise
- Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.

229
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,040
- Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
- It is the more like to be feigned...

230
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,400
I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allowed
your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you.

231
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,760
If you be not mad, be gone;
if you have reason, be brief.

232
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,040
Will you hoist sail, sir?
Here lies your way.

233
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,320
No, good swabber;
I am to hull here a little longer.

234
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,760
- Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady ?
- Speak your office.

235
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,040
It alone concerns your ear.

236
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,160
I bring no overture of war,
my words are of peace as matter.

237
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,800
Yet you began rudely.
What are you? what would you?

238
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,960
The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
learned from my entertainment.

239
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,480
What I am, and what I would,
are as secret as maidenhead...

240
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,280
to your ears, divinity,
to any other's, profanation.

241
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,120
Give us the place alone...

242
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,640
we will hear this divinity.

243
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,920
Now Sir, what is your text?

244
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,200
- Most sweet lady,—
-A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.

245
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,360
-Where lies your text?
-In Orsino's bosom.

246
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,080
- In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
-in the first of his heart.

247
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,920
O, I have read it: it is heresy.

248
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,960
-Have you no more to say?
-Good madam, let me see your face.

249
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Have you any commission from your lord
to negotiate with my face?

250
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,880
You are now out of your text: but
we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.

251
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,440
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present:
is't not well done?

252
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,880
Excellently done,
if God did all.

253
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,640
'Tis in grain, sir;
'twill endure wind and weather.

254
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,560
'Tis beauty truly blent,

255
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,040
Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,

256
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,960
If you will lead these graces to the grave
And leave the world no copy.

257
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,040
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted.

258
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,440
I will giveout divers schedules of my beauty:
it shall be inventoried,

259
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,520
and every particle and utensil labelled to my will:
as, item, two lips, indifferent red;

260
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,920
item, two brown eyes, with lids to them;

261
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,480
item, one neck, one chin, and so forth.

262
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:35,800
I see you what you are, you are too proud;
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.

263
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,440
My lord and master loves you:

264
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,640
O, such love could be but recompensed,
though you were crown'd the nonpareil of beauty!

265
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,080
How does he love me?

266
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,200
With adorations

267
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,280
fertile tears,

268
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,200
With groans that thunder love,

269
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,920
with sighs of fire.

270
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,600
Your lord does know my mind;
I cannot love him:

271
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,760
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
Of great estate,

272
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,760
of fresh and stainless youth;
learn'd and valiant;

273
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,000
but yet I cannot love him;

274
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,480
If I did love you in my master's flame,
With such a suffering,

275
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,560
such a deadly life,
In your denial I would find no sense;

276
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,040
I would not understand it.

277
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,000
Why, what would you?

278
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,680
Make me a willow cabin
at your gate,

279
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,520
And call upon my soul
within the house

280
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,440
Write loyal cantons
of contemned love

281
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,000
And sing them loud
even in the dead of night;

282
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,240
Halloo your name
to the reverberate hills

283
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,120
And make
the babbling gossip of the air

284
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,800
Cry out ...

285
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,160
"Olivia"!

286
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,920
O, You should not rest
Between the elements of air and earth,

287
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,520
But you should pity me!

288
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,680
You might do much.

289
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,440
What is your parentage?

290
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,720
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
I am a gentleman.

291
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,360
Get you to your lord;

292
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,520
I cannot love him:

293
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,040
let him send no more;

294
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,120
Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
To tell me how he takes it.

295
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,920
Fare you well: I thank you for your pains:
spend this for me.

296
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,840
I am no fee'd post, lady;
keep your purse:

297
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,440
My master, not myself,
lacks recompense.

298
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,560
Farewell, fair cruelty.

299
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,640
'What is your parentage?'
'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:

300
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,560
I am a gentleman.'
I'll be sworn thou art;

301
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,160
Nay, not too fast.
Unless the master were the man.

302
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,400
How now!
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?

303
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,940
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
With an invisible and subtle stealth

304
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,120
To creep in at mine eyes.

305
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,800
Well, let it be.

306
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,160
What ho, Malvolio!

307
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,720
Here, madam, at your service.

308
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,040
Run after that same peevish messenger,
The county's man:

309
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,160
he left this ring behind him,
Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.

310
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,920
Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:

311
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,960
If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
I'll give him reasons for't:

312
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,960
- hie thee, Malvolio.
-Madam, I will.

313
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,600
I do I know not what, and fear to find
Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.

314
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,640
Fate, show thy force:
ourselves we do not owe;

315
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,880
What is decreed must be,
and be this so.

316
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,200
Were not you even now
with the Countess Olivia?

317
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,560
Even now, sir; on a moderate pace
I have since arrived but hither.

318
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,440
he returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.

319
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,960
She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
into a desperate assurance she will none of him:

320
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,160
-Well, receive it so !
- She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.

321
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,280
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
will is, it should be so returned:

322
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,640
if it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye;
if not, be it his that finds it.

323
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,200
I left no ring with her!

324
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,640
what means this lady?

325
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,920
Fortune forbid my outside
have not charm'd her!

326
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,200
She made good view of me;

327
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,740
indeed, so much, That sure methought
her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts

328
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,680
distractedly.

329
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,480
She loves me !

330
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,800
Sure ...

331
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,520
I am the man !

332
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,720
Will you stay no longer?

333
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,360
-Let me yet know of you... wither you are bound !
-No.

334
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,360
You must know of me then, Antonio.

335
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,360
My name is Sebastian.

336
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,920
My father was that Sebastian of Messaline,
whom I know you have heard of.

337
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,840
He left behind him myself
and a sister ... Viola.

338
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,520
both born in an hour:
would we had so ended!

339
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,640
but you, sir, altered that...

340
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,600
Before you took me from the breach
of the sea was my sister drowned.

341
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:54,419
alas the day !

342
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,600
A lady, sir, though it was said
she much resembled me -

343
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,880
was yet of many
accounted beautiful.

344
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,920
O good Antonio,
forgive me your trouble.

345
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,600
If you will not murder me for my love,
let me be your servant.

346
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,399
Desire it not !

347
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,560
Fare ye well at once !

348
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,440
I am bound to
the Count Orsino's court: farewell.

349
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,880
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!

350
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,280
I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
Else would I very shortly see thee there.

351
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,400
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,

352
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,360
Methought she purged the air of pestilence!

353
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,240
That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
And my desires,

354
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,240
like fell and cruel hounds,
E'er since pursue me.

355
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,840
Approach ! Sir Andrew !

356
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,960
Maria!

357
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,680
Maria!

358
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,200
Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!

359
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,200
Did you never see the picture
of 'we three'?

360
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,360
Welcome, ass !

361
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,880
Three happy boys we

362
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,920
Three happy boys we

363
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,200
Sir Tobias!

364
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,240
Tillyvally. Lady!

365
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,960
Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.

366
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,680
<i> ... and Malvolio's
a Peg-a-Ramsey! </ i></i>

367
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,960
Malvolio's nose is no whipstock,
and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.

368
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,560
Excellent !

369
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,080
Now a song !

370
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,360
Come on; there is sixpence for you:
let's have a song.

371
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,560
That old and antique song
we heard last night:

372
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,800
Methought it did relieve my passion much,

373
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,200
He is not here, so please your lordship
that should sing it.

374
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,360
-Who was it?
-Feste, my lord.

375
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,360
a fool that the lady
Olivia's father took much delight in.

376
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,080
- Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
-A love-song.

377
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,840
-A love-song !
- Ay, ay: I care not for good life.

378
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,280
<i>O mistress mine, where are you roaming?</i>

379
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
<i>O, stay and hear;</i>

380
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,160
<i>your true love's coming,</i>

381
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,200
How dost thou like this tune?

382
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,840
It gives a very echo to the seat
Where Love is throned.

383
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,880
Thou dost speak masterly.

384
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,320
<i>Every wise man's son doth know.</i>

385
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,240
Excellent good, i' faith !

386
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,760
Good! Good!

387
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,400
<i>What is love? 'tis not hereafter;</i>

388
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,040
<i>Present mirth hath present laughter;</i>

389
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,200
My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:

390
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,760
Hath it not, boy?

391
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,520
- A little, by your favour.
- What kind of woman is't?

392
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,280
Of your complexion.

393
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,600
She is not worth thee, then.

394
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,760
What years, i' faith? ?
-About your years, my lord.

395
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,520
Too old by heaven!

396
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,000
let still the woman take
An elder than herself: so wears she to him,

397
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,240
For, boy ...

398
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,760
however we do praise ourselves,

399
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,240
Our fancies are more
giddy and unfirm,

400
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,520
More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
Than women's are.

401
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,760
-I think it well, my lord.
-Then let thy love be younger than thyself,

402
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,880
For women are as roses,

403
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,040
whose fair flower,
being once display'd,

404
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,840
doth fall that very hour.

405
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,520
And so they are

406
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,440
alas, that they are so;

407
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,760
To die, even when they to perfection grow!

408
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,640
<i>What's to come is still unsure:</i>

409
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,320
<i>In delay there lies no plenty;</i>

410
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:02,600
<i>Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,</i>

411
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,760
<i>Youth's a stuff will not endure.</i>

412
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,880
<i>Youth's a stuff will not endure.</i>

413
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,240
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.

414
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,960
- A contagious breath.
- Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.

415
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,760
But ...

416
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,040
... shall we make the welkin dance indeed?

417
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,040
Shall we?!

418
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,520
<i>There lives a man in Babylon</i>

419
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,600
<i>'O, the twelfth day of December,'—</i>

420
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,960
<i>my true love said to me...</i>

421
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,240
My masters ... are you mad ?

422
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,880
Have yeno wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
tinkers at this time of night?

423
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,840
Do ye make an
alehouse of my lady's house?

424
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,680
Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
time in you?

425
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,320
We did keep time, sir, in our catches.

426
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,760
Sneck up!

427
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,280
Sir Toby ...

428
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,120
I must be round with you.:

429
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,600
My lady bade me tell you, that,
though she harbours you as her kinsman,

430
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,880
she's nothing allied to your disorders.
If you can separate yourself and your ...

431
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,520
... misdemeanors, you
are welcome to the house; if not, ...

432
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,880
... she is very willing to bid
you farewell.

433
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,760
<i>'Farewell, dear heart,</i>

434
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,480
<i>since I must needs be gone.'</i>

435
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,000
<i>'His eyes do show
his days are almost done.'</i>

436
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,560
<i>- 'But I will never die.'
- Sir Toby, there you lie.</i>

437
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,920
<i>- This is much credit to you !
 -  'Shall I bid him go?'</i>

438
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,520
<i>'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'</i>

439
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:41,160
<i>'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'</i>

440
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,760
Out o' tune, sir: ye lie.

441
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,000
Art any more than a
steward?

442
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,480
Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous...

443
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,000
...there shall be no more cakes and ale?

444
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,480
Yes, by Saint Anne,
and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.

445
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,400
Thou'rt i' the right.
Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs.

446
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,040
A stoup of wine, Maria!

447
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,200
Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour-

448
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,760
at any
thing more than contempt,

449
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,080
you would not give means
for this uncivil rule:.

450
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,360
she shall know of it...

451
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,160
... by this hand !

452
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,160
Go shake your ears.

453
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,960
-Bolts and shackles!
-be patient ... for tonight!

454
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:27,040
For Monsieur Malvolio ...
if I do not make him a common recreation...

455
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,600
... do not think I have wit enough to lie
straight in my bed: I know I can do it.

456
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,080
Possess us, possess us;
tell us something of him.

457
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:41,320
- Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
- O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!

458
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,720
The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
constantly, but a time-pleaser;

459
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:51,520
so crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him;

460
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,160
and on that vice in him will my revenge find
notable cause to work.

461
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,240
What wilt thou do?

462
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,480
I will drop in his way some obscure
epistles of love;

463
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,800
wherein he shall find
himself most feelingly personated.

464
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,680
I can write very
like my lady your niece

465
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,200
on a forgotten matter we
can hardly make distinction of our hands.

466
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,840
- Excellent! I smell a device.
-I have't in my nose too.

467
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,400
But for this night ...

468
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,000
To bed...

469
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,760
Dream on the event.

470
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,680
Farewell.

471
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,560
Good night, Penthesilea !

472
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,880
Before me, she's a good wench.

473
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,440
She's a beagle, true-bred,

474
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,680
and one that adores me...

475
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,880
what o' that?

476
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,320
I was adored once too.

477
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,960
Come, come, I'll go burn some sack;
'tis too late to go to bed now

478
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,440
Disguise...

479
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,600
I see, thou art a wickedness,

480
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,600
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.

481
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,560
How will this fadge?

482
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,720
As I am man,

483
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,040
My state is desperate for my master's love;

484
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,120
As I am woman,

485
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,760
—now alas the day!—
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!

486
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,560
Come hither, boy!

487
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,320
Come, boy. Come!

488
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,960
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else...

489
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,480
That live in her.

490
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:28,360
when liver, brain and heart,
are all supplied with one self king!

491
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,560
Sir, shall I to this lady?

492
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,680
Ay, that's the theme.
To her in haste...

493
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,960
Tell her my love can give no place,
bide no denay.

494
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,200
Malvolio is
coming down this walk !

495
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,680
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian. Wouldst thou not
be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter
come by some notable shame?

496
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,760
He brought me out o' favour with
my lady about a bear-baiting here.

497
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,840
Get ye all three into the box-tree!

498
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,560
"My Lady ..."

499
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,560
"My Lady. Countess ..."

500
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,240
for here comes the trout
that must be caught with tickling.

501
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,360
'Tis but fortune; all is fortune..

502
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,920
Maria once told me
she did affect me-

503
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,560
and I have heard herself come
thus near, that, .-

504
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,400
-should she fancy, ...

505
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,800
...  it should be one of my complexion

506
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:16,160
Besides, she uses me with a more ...
...exalted respect

507
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,040
'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!

508
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,560
-To be Count Malvolio!  ...
-Ah, rogue!

509
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,760
Having been three months married to her,

510
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,360
- ... sitting in my state...
-O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye! !

511
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,840
Calling my officers about me,
in my branched velvet gown ...

512
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,080
having come from a day-bed,
where I have left

513
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,320
Olivia sleeping, ...

514
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,280
and then, after a demure
travel of regard,

515
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,800
telling them I know my
place as I would they should do theirs,

516
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,360
-to ask for my kinsman: Toby !

517
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:21,280
I frown the while;
and perchance wind up my watch,  ...

518
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,120
... or play with my -

519
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,680
- some rich jewel.

520
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,400
Toby approaches; courtesies there to me,
I extend my hand to him ...

521
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,360
...thus saying, 'Cousin Toby,
You must amend your drunkenness !'

522
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,600
Out, scab!

523
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,960
What employment have we here?

524
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,520
By my life, this is my lady's hand!

525
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,760
"'To the unknown... beloved"

526
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,600
"... this, and my good wishes."

527
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,840
By your leave, wax.
Soft! ...

528
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,280
and the impressure her Lucrece,
with which she uses to seal.

529
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,360
'tis my lady.

530
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,720
To whom should this be?

531
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,440
<i>"Jove knows I love: But who? "</i>

532
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,120
<i>"Lips, do not move;
No man must know. "</i>

533
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,880
<i>"'No man must know "?</i>

534
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,840
if this should be thee, Malvolio? !

535
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,520
<i>"I may command where I adore;
But silence, like a Lucrece knife"</i>

536
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,720
<i>"With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
M, O, A, I, doth sway my life. "</i>

537
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,960
-M.O.A.I. ..
- Excellent wench, say I.

538
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,280
Let me see ... "M.O.A.I."

539
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,720
" I may command where I adore."

540
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:22,480
Why, she may command
me: I serve her; she is my lady.

541
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:28,040
and the end,-what should
that alphabetical position portend? "M.O.A.I"?

542
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:33,440
Moai ... Moa ... i. .. M!

543
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,240
M,- Malvolio; M,- why, that begins my name !

544
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,960
A should follow but O does.

545
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,200
and yet, to crush this a little,
it would bow to me

546
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,680
for every one of these letters
are in my name !

547
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,080
Soft! ...

548
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,600
here follows prose.

549
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,920
<i>"In my stars I am above thee;
but be not afraid of greatness."</i>

550
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,120
<i>"some are born great, some achieve greatness,
and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.."</i>

551
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,920
<i>"Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
thy tongue tang arguments of state. "</i>

552
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:27,760
<i>"put thyself into the trick of singularity:
she thus advises thee that sighs for thee. "</i>

553
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,680
<i>Remember who co- ...</i>

554
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,720
<i>"Remember who commended
thy yellow stockings,"</i>

555
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,400
<i>"and wished to see thee ever
cross-gartered."</i>

556
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,480
<i>" I say, remember. Go to, thou art
made, if thou desirest to be so."</i>

557
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,000
<i>"if not, let me see thee ... a steward still...."</i>

558
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:49,160
<i>"... the fellow of servants,...
and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell."</i>

559
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,520
<i>"She that would alter services with thee,
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY."</i>

560
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,800
Daylight and champaign
discovers not more.

561
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,400
I will be proud,
I will baffle Sir Toby...

562
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,160
I will wash off gross acquaintance,
I will be point-devise the very man.

563
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,920
I do not now fool myself,
to let imagination jade me...

564
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,080
for every reason excites to this:

565
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,320
...that my lady loves me.

566
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,000
Jove and my stars be praised!

567
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,760
Here is yet a postscript !

568
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,220
"Y'Thou canst not choose but know who I am.
If thou entertainest my love," -

569
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:35,120
"let it appear in thy smiling;
thy smiles become thee well."

570
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,760
"therefore in my
presence still smile"

571
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,520
"dear my sweet, I prithee."

572
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,280
Jove, I thank thee!

573
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,840
I will smile!

574
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,360
I will do everything
that thou wilt have me.!

575
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,640
Jove, I thank thee!

576
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,280
Jove, I am happy !

577
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:15,160
- I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands!
- I could marry this wench for this device !

578
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,840
-Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
-Or o' mine either?

579
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:29,240
- Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
- Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.

580
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,520
Then, mark his first approach
before my lady:

581
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,200
he will come to
her in yellow stockings,

582
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,080
and 'tis a colour she abhors !

583
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,360
Save thee, friend,
dost thou live by thy music ?

584
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,280
- No, sir, I live by the church.
-Art thou a churchman?

585
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,920
No such matter, sir: I do live by the church;
for I do live at my house,

586
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,880
and my house doth stand by
the church.

587
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,080
Hold, there's expenses for thee.

588
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:01,920
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair,
send thee a beard!

589
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,600
By my troth, I'll tell thee,
I am almost sick for one;

590
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,320
though I would not have it
grow on my chin.

591
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,080
Is thy
lady within?

592
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:21,320
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir,
to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.

593
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,120
I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.

594
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,240
The matter, I hope, is not great, sir,
begging but a beggar:

595
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,400
Cressida was a beggar.

596
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,920
My lady is within, sir.
I will construe to her whence you come;

597
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,000
- Save you, gentleman.
- And you, sir.

598
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,360
<i>-Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
- Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.</i>

599
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,640
I hope, sir, you are;
as I am yours.

600
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:24,520
my niece is desirous
you should enter, if your trade be to her.

601
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,000
your niece, sir; is the list of my voyage.
But we are prevented.

602
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,680
Most excellent accomplished lady,
the heavens rain odours on you!

603
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,440
'Rain odours' ? well.
That youth's a rare courtier:

604
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,080
My matter hath no voice, to your own
most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.

605
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,320
'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:'
I'll get 'em all three all ready.

606
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:04,280
Let the garden door be shut,
and leave me to my hearing.

607
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:19,480
- Give me your hand, sir.
- My duty, madam, and most humble service.

608
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:31,200
-What's your name?
- Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.

609
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:37,160
- You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
- And he is yours, and his must needs be yours.

610
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,600
For him, I think not on him...

611
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,280
for his thoughts, Would they were blanks,
rather than fill'd with me!

612
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:48,120
- I come to whet your gentle thoughts on his behalf.
- Give me leave, beseech you.

613
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,280
I did send ...

614
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,400
... After the last enchantment you did here...

615
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,620
A ring ... in chase of you

616
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:07,660
so did I abuse myself,
my servant and, I fear me, you

617
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:14,219
To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
which you knew none of yours...

618
01:08:16,379 --> 01:08:20,699
what might you think?
Have you not set mine honour at the stake ?

619
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:28,459
- So, let me hear you speak.
- I pity you.

620
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,219
That's a degree to love.

621
01:08:32,459 --> 01:08:35,799
No, not a grize.

622
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:38,939
For 'tis a vulgar proof,
That very oft we pity enemies.

623
01:08:54,419 --> 01:08:58,779
Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.

624
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:06,419
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.

625
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:13,859
Be not afraid, good youth,
I will not have you.

626
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:20,699
And yet, when wit
and youth is come to harvest...

627
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:24,539
Your wife is alike
to reap a proper man.

628
01:09:26,699 --> 01:09:29,379
There lies your way, due west.

629
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:35,019
Then westward-ho!

630
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:43,419
You'll nothing, madam,
to my lord by me?

631
01:09:48,459 --> 01:09:49,419
Stay !

632
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:55,859
I prithee, tell me
what thou thinkest of me.

633
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:58,859
That you do think you are
not what you are.

634
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:03,619
- If I think so, I think the same of you.
- Then think you right: I am not what I am.

635
01:10:03,718 --> 01:10:04,818
I would you was
as I would have you be!

636
01:10:04,919 --> 01:10:07,999
Would it be better, madam, than I am?
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.

637
01:10:08,139 --> 01:10:12,339
O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
In the contempt and anger of his lip!

638
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:17,619
Grace and good disposition
Attend your ladyship!

639
01:10:19,619 --> 01:10:22,019
Cesario, by the roses
of the spring,

640
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:25,379
By maidhood, honour,
truth and every thing,

641
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:28,019
I love thee so, that,

642
01:10:28,379 --> 01:10:32,199
...maugre all thy pride,
nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.

643
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:40,459
By innocence I swear, and by my youth
I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,

644
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:42,859
And that no woman has;

645
01:10:44,899 --> 01:10:48,579
nor never none shall mistress be of it,
save I alone.

646
01:10:53,899 --> 01:10:54,859
And so ...

647
01:10:57,059 --> 01:10:59,579
adieu, good madam...

648
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:03,579
never more will I my master's tears
to you deplore.

649
01:11:03,779 --> 01:11:09,139
Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

650
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:09,859
-  I could not stay behind you...
- My kind Antonio !

651
01:12:12,259 --> 01:12:15,699
And not all love to see you,
you sir are a stranger to these parts...

652
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:20,859
I can no other answer make
but thanks, And thanks.

653
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:25,759
and oft good turns
are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.

654
01:12:29,019 --> 01:12:32,099
I am not weary, and 'tis long to night.

655
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:37,059
I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
With the memorials -

656
01:12:37,259 --> 01:12:39,459
- and the things of fame
that do renown this city.

657
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:43,619
I do not without danger walk these streets...

658
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:49,299
Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst Orsino his galleys
I did some service...

659
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:54,159
of such note indeed, that were I
ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.

660
01:12:54,259 --> 01:12:56,219
Belike you slew
great number of his people. ?

661
01:12:57,419 --> 01:13:01,799
For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
I shall pay dear.

662
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:06,779
- Do not then walk too open.
- You shall find me at the Elephant.

663
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:10,659
Why I your purse ?

664
01:13:12,419 --> 01:13:16,259
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
You have desire to purchase

665
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:21,699
and your store,
I think, is not for idle markets, sir.

666
01:13:27,019 --> 01:13:28,859
- At the Elephant.
- I do remember.

667
01:13:34,019 --> 01:13:41,059
if ever thou shalt love, remember me;
For such as I am all true lovers are,

668
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:48,339
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else.

669
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:54,019
Save in the constant image
of the creature that is beloved.

670
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:23,859
O, fellow, come, play that piece
of song we had last night.

671
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:27,499
Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;

672
01:14:28,419 --> 01:14:33,419
The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
do use to chant it...

673
01:14:39,339 --> 01:14:43,619
<i>Come away,</i>

674
01:14:44,419 --> 01:14:49,499
<i>come away, death,</i>

675
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:55,659
<i>And in sad cypress</i>

676
01:14:56,099 --> 01:14:59,859
<i>let me be laid;</i>

677
01:15:01,299 --> 01:15:04,739
<i>Fly away breath</i>

678
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:10,659
<i>Fly away, fly away breath;</i>

679
01:15:12,419 --> 01:15:15,299
<i>I am slain</i>

680
01:15:16,019 --> 01:15:23,139
<i>by a fair cruel maid.</i>

681
01:15:27,499 --> 01:15:31,339
<i>Not a friend,</i>

682
01:15:32,459 --> 01:15:34,859
<i>not a friend greet</i>

683
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:42,019
<i>My poor corpse,</i>

684
01:15:43,299 --> 01:15:47,259
<i>where my bones shall be thrown:</i>

685
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:54,699
<i>A thousand thousand sighs to save,</i>

686
01:15:55,419 --> 01:15:59,059
<i>Lay me, O, where</i>

687
01:15:59,739 --> 01:16:03,939
<i>Sad true lover</i>

688
01:16:05,099 --> 01:16:10,059
<i>never find my grave,</i>

689
01:16:13,139 --> 01:16:16,459
<i>To weep there!</i>

690
01:16:28,499 --> 01:16:31,859
- There's for thy pains.
- No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.

691
01:16:32,499 --> 01:16:35,579
- I'll pay thy pleasure then.
- Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid,

692
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:37,299
one time or another.

693
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:48,379
Now, the melancholy god protect you;
for your mind is a very opal.

694
01:16:49,259 --> 01:16:50,379
Farewell.

695
01:16:52,259 --> 01:16:56,979
Once more, Cesario,
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty !

696
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,579
- But if she cannot love you, sir?
-  I cannot so be answer'd.

697
01:17:01,758 --> 01:17:02,658
Sooth, but you must.

698
01:17:02,759 --> 01:17:07,199
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, hath for your love
a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia...

699
01:17:07,339 --> 01:17:09,899
you cannot love her.
You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?

700
01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:14,859
There is no woman's sides can bide the beating
of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart;

701
01:17:15,099 --> 01:17:18,259
No woman's heart so big, to hold
so much; they lack retention !

702
01:17:18,619 --> 01:17:21,179
Alas, their love
may be call'd appetite,

703
01:17:21,419 --> 01:17:24,619
But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
And can digest as much.

704
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:30,179
make no compare between that love
a woman can bear me and that I owe Olivia.

705
01:17:30,419 --> 01:17:33,739
- Ay, but I know ...
- What dost thou know?

706
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:39,379
Too well what love women to men may owe:
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.

707
01:17:39,859 --> 01:17:44,339
My father had a daughter loved a man,
As it might be,

708
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:49,859
... perhaps, were I a woman,
I should your lordship.

709
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:53,179
And what's her history?

710
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:03,659
A blank, my lord.

711
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:10,219
She never told her love,

712
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:16,219
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,

713
01:18:17,499 --> 01:18:19,259
Feed on her damask cheek.

714
01:18:21,699 --> 01:18:24,499
she pined in thought,

715
01:18:27,019 --> 01:18:33,219
And with a green and yellow melancholy
She sat like patience on a monument,

716
01:18:36,459 --> 01:18:39,099
Smiling at grief.

717
01:18:42,699 --> 01:18:45,959
Was not this love indeed?

718
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:53,979
We men may say more,
swear more...

719
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:58,939
but indeed
Our shows are more than will...

720
01:18:59,799 --> 01:19:03,739
for still we prove
Much in our vows,

721
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:06,899
but little in our love.

722
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:15,099
But died thy sister
of her love, my boy?

723
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:18,779
I am all the daughters
of my father's house,

724
01:19:20,499 --> 01:19:22,219
And all the brothers too.

725
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:26,499
and yet I know not.

726
01:19:51,619 --> 01:19:53,539
I'll do my best
To woo your lady...

727
01:19:57,139 --> 01:19:58,999
yet, a barful strife!

728
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:03,899
Whoe'er I woo,
myself would be his wife.

729
01:21:33,459 --> 01:21:35,779
No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.

730
01:21:36,019 --> 01:21:38,179
Thy reason, dear venom,
give thy reason.

731
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:42,939
Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me!

732
01:21:43,139 --> 01:21:47,019
- I saw't i' the orchard. !
- Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.

733
01:21:47,299 --> 01:21:48,659
As plain as I see you now.

734
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:52,759
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.

735
01:21:52,798 --> 01:21:54,998
'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?

736
01:21:55,099 --> 01:22:01,739
She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour.

737
01:22:03,259 --> 01:22:06,139
You should then have accosted her;
and banged the youth into dumbness.

738
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:10,379
you are now sailed
into the north of my lady's opinion.

739
01:22:10,579 --> 01:22:15,539
unless you do redeem it by
some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.

740
01:22:16,499 --> 01:22:21,179
It must be with valour; for policy
I hate: I had as lief be a puritan as a politician. .

741
01:22:21,419 --> 01:22:25,779
Why, then, challenge me
the count's youth to fight with him

742
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:30,619
hurt him in eleven places:
my niece shall take note of it.

743
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:35,379
there is no love-broker in the world
can more prevail than report of valour.

744
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:41,879
- Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
- Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief!

745
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:45,539
it is no matter how witty,
so it be eloquent.

746
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:46,739
about it !

747
01:22:47,779 --> 01:22:49,339
Taunt him with the licence of ink !

748
01:22:49,939 --> 01:22:51,059
Where shall I find you?

749
01:22:51,419 --> 01:22:54,779
We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.

750
01:22:57,299 --> 01:22:59,299
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.

751
01:22:59,979 --> 01:23:03,859
I have been dear to him, lad,
some two thousand strong, or so.

752
01:23:07,019 --> 01:23:10,259
Yond gull Malvolio is
turned heathen.

753
01:23:11,379 --> 01:23:15,179
- He's in yellow stockings.
- And cross-gartered?

754
01:23:26,619 --> 01:23:28,459
How now ... Malvolio ...?

755
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:32,299
Sweet lady, ho, ho.

756
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:37,259
Smilest thou?
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.

757
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:44,179
Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering.

758
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:47,459
but what of that? if it please the eye of one...

759
01:23:48,859 --> 01:23:53,899
-  'Please one, and please all.'
- Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?

760
01:23:53,939 --> 01:23:57,219
Not black in my mind, ...
though yellow in my legs.

761
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:02,899
It did come to his hands,

762
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:08,139
and commands shall be executed

763
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:14,019
I think we do know
the sweet Roman hand.

764
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:22,419
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?

765
01:24:24,339 --> 01:24:25,259
To bed ?

766
01:24:27,499 --> 01:24:30,299
ay, sweet-heart.

767
01:24:32,339 --> 01:24:33,979
and I'll come to thee.

768
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:38,699
God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so
and kiss thy hand so oft?

769
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:42,379
How do you, Malvolio?

770
01:24:42,979 --> 01:24:45,379
Why appear you with this
ridiculous boldness before my lady?

771
01:24:45,979 --> 01:24:49,779
'Be not afraid of greatness:'
'twas well writ.

772
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:55,619
'Some achieve greatness, and some
have greatness thrust upon them.'

773
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:01,059
'Remember who commended
thy yellow stockings,'

774
01:25:01,299 --> 01:25:06,259
'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'
'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'

775
01:25:06,499 --> 01:25:08,019
Why, this is very
midsummer madness !

776
01:25:08,659 --> 01:25:11,899
Madam, the young gentleman
of the Count Orsino's is returned.

777
01:25:12,139 --> 01:25:15,539
I'll come to him.

778
01:25:15,658 --> 01:25:17,658
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to.

779
01:25:17,859 --> 01:25:21,439
Where's my cousin Toby?
Let some of my people have a special care of him

780
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:27,179
O, ho! do you come near me now?

781
01:25:29,019 --> 01:25:32,539
no worse man than
Sir Toby to look to me!

782
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:38,819
she sends him on purpose, that I may appear
stubborn to him; I have limed her !!!

783
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:45,619
but it is Jove's doing,
and Jove make me thankful!

784
01:25:47,299 --> 01:25:54,119
And when she went away now, 'Let this fellow be looked to:'
fellow! not Malvolio, nor after my degree, but fellow.

785
01:25:54,459 --> 01:25:56,619
Why, every thing
adheres together !

786
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:00,139
What can be said?

787
01:26:01,179 --> 01:26:02,619
Nothing that can be ...

788
01:26:03,299 --> 01:26:08,099
... can come between me and the full
prospect of my hopes.

789
01:26:09,979 --> 01:26:14,099
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little,
yet I'll speak to him.

790
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:17,299
Go off; I discard you.

791
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:20,239
Sir Toby, my lady prays you
to have a care of him.

792
01:26:21,519 --> 01:26:22,699
Ah, ha! does she so?

793
01:26:24,499 --> 01:26:29,219
- What, man! defy the devil !
- Do you know what you say?

794
01:26:29,499 --> 01:26:32,959
La you, an you speak ill of the devil,
how he takes it at heart!

795
01:26:33,059 --> 01:26:35,859
-Carry his water to the wise woman.
- it shall be done to-morrow morning.

796
01:26:37,339 --> 01:26:40,699
- My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
- How now, mistress!

797
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:47,179
-  let me enjoy my private.
- Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray !

798
01:26:47,459 --> 01:26:49,979
My prayers, minx!

799
01:26:50,499 --> 01:26:55,419
- No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
-you are idle shallow things...

800
01:26:56,459 --> 01:27:00,419
I am not of your element: you shall know
more hereafter.

801
01:27:21,699 --> 01:27:22,979
Is't possible?

802
01:27:28,339 --> 01:27:32,259
If this were played upon a stage now, I could
condemn it as an improbable fiction.

803
01:27:33,819 --> 01:27:36,699
Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound.

804
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:44,299
- Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
- My niece is already in the belief that he's mad

805
01:27:44,779 --> 01:27:49,019
we may carry it thus,
for our pleasure and his penance.

806
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:54,779
a scurvy fellow thou art !

807
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:59,219
More matter for a May morning.

808
01:28:03,059 --> 01:28:05,179
Here's the challenge, read it.

809
01:28:05,459 --> 01:28:10,219
- I warrant there's vinegar and pepper in't.
- Is't so saucy?

810
01:28:15,459 --> 01:28:19,259
<i>'Youth, whatsoever thou art,
thou art but a scurvy fellow.'</i>

811
01:28:19,499 --> 01:28:20,139
Good, and valiant.

812
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:26,179
<i>"Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
sight she uses thee kindly."</i>

813
01:28:26,419 --> 01:28:30,339
<i>"but that is not the matter
I challenge thee for"</i>

814
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:33,419
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense  ...

815
01:28:35,419 --> 01:28:40,859
<i>" I will waylay thee going home; where if it
be thy chance to kill me, ..."</i>

816
01:28:41,459 --> 01:28:42,419
Good!

817
01:28:42,939 --> 01:28:46,419
<i>"...Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain."</i>

818
01:28:47,659 --> 01:28:50,779
Still you keep o' the windy side
of the law: good.

819
01:28:52,019 --> 01:28:55,379
<i>"Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon
one of our souls!"</i>

820
01:28:56,259 --> 01:28:59,319
<i>"He may have mercy upon mine; but
my hope is better"</i>

821
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:01,859
<i>"and so look to thyself."</i>

822
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:04,299
<i>"Thy friend,  ..."</i>

823
01:29:12,099 --> 01:29:14,859
<i>"... as thou usest him,
and thy sworn enemy, ."</i>

824
01:29:14,919 --> 01:29:17,119
<i>ANDREW AGUECHEEK.</i>

825
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:21,979
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot !
I'll give't him.

826
01:29:23,419 --> 01:29:27,419
He is now in some commerce with my lady,
but will by and by depart.

827
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:32,619
Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
orchard like a bum-baily.

828
01:29:32,819 --> 01:29:39,019
so soon as ever thou seest him, draw;
and, as thou drawest swear horrible! Away!

829
01:29:39,859 --> 01:29:41,619
Nay, let me alone for swearing !

830
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:45,899
I will deliver his challenge by
word of mouth.

831
01:29:48,459 --> 01:29:51,779
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny ?

832
01:29:51,979 --> 01:29:55,219
Nothing but this;
your true love for my master.

833
01:29:55,459 --> 01:29:58,099
How with mine honour may I give him that
Which I have given to you?

834
01:29:58,499 --> 01:30:00,379
I will acquit you !

835
01:30:00,758 --> 01:30:02,158
Thou art a foolish fellow...

836
01:30:02,858 --> 01:30:05,758
Will you make me believe
that I am not sent for you?

837
01:30:07,459 --> 01:30:10,619
Go to, go to !...

838
01:30:10,819 --> 01:30:14,139
Well, come again to-morrow:
fare thee well !

839
01:30:15,219 --> 01:30:18,139
A fiend like thee
might bear my soul to hell !

840
01:30:22,179 --> 01:30:25,579
-Let me be clear of thee !
-Well... Hell not.

841
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:35,679
- Gentleman, God save thee.
- And you, sir.

842
01:30:35,919 --> 01:30:38,259
That defence thou hast,
betake thee to't.

843
01:30:38,459 --> 01:30:44,139
of what nature the wrongs are thou hast
done him, I know not; but thy intercepter

844
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:48,359
...bloody as the hunter,
attends thee at the orchard-end.

845
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:51,659
You mistake, sir; I am sure no man
hath any quarrel to me.

846
01:30:52,099 --> 01:30:54,099
You'll find it otherwise,
I assure you.

847
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:59,019
therefore, if you hold your life at any price,
betake you to your guard

848
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:03,579
for your opposite hath in him what
youth, strength...

849
01:31:03,939 --> 01:31:06,339
...skill and wrath can furnish man withal.

850
01:31:07,179 --> 01:31:11,739
- I beseech you, sir, what is he?
- he is a devil in private brawl.

851
01:31:12,379 --> 01:31:15,539
souls and bodies
hath he divorced three.

852
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:20,779
I will return again into the house and
desire some conduct of the lady.

853
01:31:21,499 --> 01:31:23,019
I am no fighter.

854
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:29,019
I beseech you  to know what my offence to him is:
it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.

855
01:31:29,939 --> 01:31:32,139
Signior Fabian, stay you by this
gentleman till my return.

856
01:31:34,339 --> 01:31:35,739
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?

857
01:31:36,939 --> 01:31:40,779
I know the knight is incensed against you,
even to a mortal arbitrement...

858
01:31:40,819 --> 01:31:44,419
Why, man, he's a very devil;
I have not seen such a firago.

859
01:31:44,979 --> 01:31:49,099
I had a pass with him, and he gives me
the stuck in with such a mortal motion ...

860
01:31:49,819 --> 01:31:54,939
... that it is inevitable; they say he has been
fencer to the Shah of Persia.

861
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:59,219
- Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
- Ay, but he will not now be pacified.

862
01:32:00,179 --> 01:32:03,539
- Fabian can scarce hold him yonder
- Plague on't!

863
01:32:03,859 --> 01:32:06,619
Let him let the matter slip,
and I'll give him my horse.

864
01:32:08,019 --> 01:32:09,739
I'll make the motion.

865
01:32:11,379 --> 01:32:14,899
stand here, make a good show on't.

866
01:32:16,099 --> 01:32:18,059
I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.

867
01:32:19,099 --> 01:32:23,139
- I will make your peace with him if I can.
-  I shall be much bound to you for't.

868
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:28,539
- I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
- He is as horribly conceited of him.

869
01:32:31,179 --> 01:32:35,539
There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
with you for's oath sake.

870
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:43,659
- Give ground, if you see him furious.
- Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy.

871
01:32:44,099 --> 01:32:47,879
the gentleman will, for his honour's sake,
have one bout with you.

872
01:33:08,099 --> 01:33:09,019
Come on ...

873
01:33:11,259 --> 01:33:11,779
To't !

874
01:34:30,019 --> 01:34:32,179
Put up your sword !

875
01:34:36,419 --> 01:34:38,579
If this young gentleman
Have done offence ...

876
01:34:40,539 --> 01:34:45,299
- I take the fault on me.
- You, sir! why, what are you?

877
01:34:45,539 --> 01:34:49,579
One, sir, that for his love
dares yet do more -

878
01:34:49,819 --> 01:34:51,619
Than you have heard him
brag to you he will.

879
01:34:53,659 --> 01:34:57,619
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.

880
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:08,739
hold! here come the officers.

881
01:35:09,859 --> 01:35:11,219
I'll be with you anon.

882
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:22,019
-Put your sword up.
-and, for that I promised you, I'll be as good as my word.

883
01:35:22,699 --> 01:35:24,839
he will bear you easily
and reins well.

884
01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:29,619
Antonio, I arrest thee
at the suit of Count Orsino.

885
01:35:29,859 --> 01:35:33,019
-You do mistake me, sir.
-No, sir, no jot.

886
01:35:33,459 --> 01:35:35,179
I know your favour well,

887
01:35:35,979 --> 01:35:38,819
Though now you have
no sea-cap on your head.

888
01:35:39,139 --> 01:35:41,619
Take him away: he knows I know him well.

889
01:35:43,019 --> 01:35:45,819
I must obey.
This comes with seeking you:

890
01:35:46,819 --> 01:35:50,379
What will you do, now my necessity
Makes me to ask you for my purse?

891
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:53,339
-  Come, sir, away.
- I must entreat of you some of that money.

892
01:35:54,139 --> 01:35:58,939
What money, sir? For the fair kindness
you have show'd me here I'll lend you something...

893
01:36:00,739 --> 01:36:02,779
Will you deny me now?

894
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:06,579
Come, sir.

895
01:36:06,739 --> 01:36:10,619
This youth that you see here
I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,

896
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:14,619
What's that to us? Go tell my lord Orsino,
We will haul him here.

897
01:36:15,299 --> 01:36:16,259
Lead me on.

898
01:36:22,539 --> 01:36:26,779
A very dishonest paltry boy,
and more a coward than a hare

899
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,679
leaving his friend here in necessity
and denying him...

900
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:33,619
A coward, a most devout coward,
religious in it.

901
01:36:33,659 --> 01:36:36,859
- 'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
-  Do; cuff him soundly ...

902
01:36:37,259 --> 01:36:40,419
- but never draw thy sword.
- An I do not !

903
01:36:42,819 --> 01:36:47,179
The have wronged me :
they have laid me into darkness !

904
01:36:50,499 --> 01:36:52,019
The world shall know it !

905
01:36:59,819 --> 01:37:03,699
No, I do not know you; nor
I am not sent to you by my lady!

906
01:37:03,939 --> 01:37:08,519
nor your name is not Master Cesario;
nor this is not my nose neither.

907
01:37:08,878 --> 01:37:10,278
Nothing that is so is so.

908
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:13,979
I prithee, foolish Greek, vent thy folly
somewhere else: Thou know'st not me.

909
01:37:14,659 --> 01:37:18,179
"Vent my folly" ! and tell me,
what I shall vent to my lady ?

910
01:37:18,219 --> 01:37:19,819
Shall I vent to her
that thou art coming?

911
01:37:21,699 --> 01:37:22,619
There's
money for thee.

912
01:37:26,099 --> 01:37:29,359
if you tarry longer, I shall give
worse payment.

913
01:37:29,619 --> 01:37:31,959
By my troth,
thou hast an open hand !

914
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:37,099
Now, sir, have I met you again?
there's for you !

915
01:37:44,459 --> 01:37:45,219
Why, there's for thee !

916
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,219
Are all
the people mad?

917
01:37:59,478 --> 01:38:01,078
Hold, sir, or I'll throw
your dagger o'er the house.

918
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:02,819
I would not be in some of
your coats for two pence.

919
01:38:04,179 --> 01:38:07,519
I'll have an action of battery against him,
though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for that !

920
01:38:07,559 --> 01:38:10,379
- Let go thy hand !
- I will not let you go, my young soldier !

921
01:38:10,518 --> 01:38:12,118
I will be free from thee !!!

922
01:38:17,019 --> 01:38:17,779
What wouldst thou now?

923
01:38:20,339 --> 01:38:21,259
What, what?

924
01:38:23,179 --> 01:38:26,339
Nay, then I must have an ounce or two
of this malapert blood from you.

925
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:33,899
Hold, Toby !!!

926
01:38:37,099 --> 01:38:40,019
On thy life I charge thee, hold !

927
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:43,379
-Madam!
-Will it be ever thus?

928
01:38:43,779 --> 01:38:49,459
Ungracious wretch, fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!

929
01:38:49,979 --> 01:38:51,699
Be not offended, dear Cesario.

930
01:38:53,819 --> 01:38:55,099
Rudesby, be gone!

931
01:38:56,019 --> 01:39:01,499
I prithee, gentle friend, go with me to my house,
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
This ruffian hath botch'd up...

932
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:05,539
that thou thereby mayst smile at this:
thou shalt not choose but go: Do not deny.

933
01:39:07,819 --> 01:39:10,859
What relish is in this?
how runs the stream?

934
01:39:12,539 --> 01:39:15,159
Or I am mad, or else this is a dream?

935
01:39:15,699 --> 01:39:18,019
Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;

936
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:22,019
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!

937
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:25,459
Nay, come, I prithee;
would thou'ldst be ruled by me!

938
01:39:26,339 --> 01:39:27,339
Madam...

939
01:39:29,539 --> 01:39:30,499
I will.

940
01:39:31,499 --> 01:39:34,939
O, say so, and so be!

941
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:46,619
Prove true, imagination...

942
01:39:48,979 --> 01:39:50,459
O, prove true.

943
01:39:55,719 --> 01:39:58,699
I would I were the first that ever
dissembled in such a gown.

944
01:40:07,499 --> 01:40:10,599
- Jove bless thee, master Parson.
- Bonos dies, Sir Toby.

945
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:15,499
As the old hermit of Prague, who never saw pen and ink,
very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc...

946
01:40:15,699 --> 01:40:18,859
'That that is is;' so I, being Master Parson, am Master
Parson; for, what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?

947
01:40:19,299 --> 01:40:21,379
To him, Sir Topas.

948
01:40:27,699 --> 01:40:30,299
What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!

949
01:40:31,019 --> 01:40:31,979
Who calls there?

950
01:40:33,779 --> 01:40:39,099
Master Topas, the curate,
who comes to visit Malvolio, the lunatic.

951
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:44,779
Good Master Topas, good Master Topas,
go to my lady...

952
01:40:44,979 --> 01:40:48,619
Out, hyperbolical fiend!
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?

953
01:40:48,859 --> 01:40:50,299
He  counterfeits well.

954
01:40:51,139 --> 01:40:54,379
Good Sir Topas,
do not think I am mad.

955
01:40:54,819 --> 01:40:58,299
they have laid me
here in hideous darkness.  ...

956
01:40:58,699 --> 01:41:02,359
- Sayest thou that house is dark?
- As Hell, Master Topas.

957
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:06,039
Why it hath bay windows
transparent as barricadoes

958
01:41:06,139 --> 01:41:09,439
and the clearstores toward
the south north are as lustrous as ebony.

959
01:41:09,739 --> 01:41:11,019
I am not mad.

960
01:41:30,499 --> 01:41:31,659
This is the air...

961
01:41:32,979 --> 01:41:34,659
that is the glorious sun

962
01:41:37,819 --> 01:41:44,379
This pearl she gave me,
I do feel't and see't;

963
01:41:45,939 --> 01:41:51,079
Yet doth this accident and
flood of fortune so far exceeds -

964
01:41:51,179 --> 01:41:56,379
- all instance, all discourse,
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes ...

965
01:41:56,939 --> 01:42:02,759
...and wrangle with my reason that persuades me
To any other trust but that I am mad...

966
01:42:03,059 --> 01:42:06,539
I am not ... mad !

967
01:42:09,419 --> 01:42:12,299
- Fare thee well.
- Master Topas !

968
01:42:13,579 --> 01:42:17,179
I would we were well rid of this
knavery.  ...

969
01:42:20,619 --> 01:42:24,179
I am now so far in offence
with my niece -

970
01:42:25,099 --> 01:42:27,099
that I cannot pursue with any safety.

971
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:46,299
Come by and by to my chamber.

972
01:42:59,939 --> 01:43:02,339
jolly Robin...

973
01:43:04,059 --> 01:43:06,779
Tell me how thy lady does.'

974
01:43:07,019 --> 01:43:07,939
Feste!

975
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:12,779
Feste!

976
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:14,659
Feste!

977
01:43:22,099 --> 01:43:27,579
Feste! Good Feste! help me to a candle,
and pen, ink and paper.

978
01:43:27,779 --> 01:43:32,179
Mr Malvolio! Alas, sir, how fell you
besides your five wits?

979
01:43:32,419 --> 01:43:35,219
Never was a man
so notoriously abused!

980
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:39,179
They have here propertied me; kept me
in darkness, sent ministers to me !

981
01:43:39,419 --> 01:43:43,019
I am as well in my wits
as any man in Illyria !

982
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:47,259
- Well-a-day that you were, sir
- By this hand, I am !

983
01:43:47,699 --> 01:43:53,379
Good Feste, some ink, paper and light;
and convey what I will set down to my lady.

984
01:43:53,979 --> 01:43:55,139
Or else the lady's mad ?

985
01:43:57,819 --> 01:44:02,159
yet, if 'twere so,
She could not sway her house ...

986
01:44:02,259 --> 01:44:06,379
command her followers, take and give back affairs
and their dispatch as I perceive she does

987
01:44:07,099 --> 01:44:10,519
There's something in't
that is ... deceiveable.

988
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:13,299
Blame not this haste of mine.

989
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:20,079
If you mean well, Now go with me
and with this holy man into the chantry by...

990
01:44:20,119 --> 01:44:22,779
there, before him, plight me
the full assurance of your faith...

991
01:44:23,019 --> 01:44:25,899
That my most jealous and
too doubtful soul may live at peace.

992
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:30,859
He shall conceal it whiles you are willing it
shall come to note.  What do you say?

993
01:44:34,139 --> 01:44:39,619
I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.

994
01:44:40,979 --> 01:44:44,259
But tell me true, are you
not mad indeed?

995
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:47,099
Or do you but counterfeit?

996
01:44:47,979 --> 01:44:50,139
Believe me, I am not;

997
01:44:51,299 --> 01:44:53,219
I tell thee true.

998
01:44:54,979 --> 01:44:59,099
Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman
till I see his brains.

999
01:45:00,299 --> 01:45:03,659
I will fetch you light and paper and ink.

1000
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:06,659
I'll requite it in the highest degree !

1001
01:45:06,939 --> 01:45:07,819
I am gone, sir,

1002
01:45:08,699 --> 01:45:12,939
And anon, sir,
I'll be with you again,

1003
01:45:14,899 --> 01:45:21,179
In a trice, like to the old Vice,
Your need to sustain...

1004
01:45:22,859 --> 01:45:28,699
Who, with dagger of lath,
In his rage and his wrath,

1005
01:45:29,019 --> 01:45:29,819
Cries, ah, ha!

1006
01:45:31,099 --> 01:45:34,019
to the devil...

1007
01:45:35,779 --> 01:45:39,339
Like a mad lad,
Pare thy nails, dad;

1008
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:45,579
Adieu, good man devil.

1009
01:45:59,259 --> 01:46:01,179
Now, as thou lovest me,
let me see his letter.

1010
01:46:04,619 --> 01:46:06,499
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?

1011
01:46:08,339 --> 01:46:11,059
Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.

1012
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:15,619
If you will let your lady know I am here and bring her
along with you, it may awake my bounty further.

1013
01:46:15,859 --> 01:46:18,459
Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty
till I come again.

1014
01:46:19,859 --> 01:46:21,779
This is the man, sir,
that did rescue me.

1015
01:46:27,779 --> 01:46:32,579
- That face of his I do remember well...
- this is that Antonio, that took the Phoenix .

1016
01:46:32,819 --> 01:46:35,139
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.

1017
01:46:35,339 --> 01:46:39,059
- He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side...
- Notable pirate!

1018
01:46:39,339 --> 01:46:43,659
Thou salt-water thief! What foolish boldness
brought thee to their mercies -

1019
01:46:43,859 --> 01:46:49,099
- whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
Hast made thine enemies?

1020
01:46:49,139 --> 01:46:51,779
Orsino, noble sir,

1021
01:46:52,459 --> 01:46:54,699
Antonio never yet
was thief or pirate,

1022
01:46:55,299 --> 01:46:56,419
Though I confess,

1023
01:46:57,259 --> 01:46:59,659
on base and ground enough,
Orsino's enemy.

1024
01:47:02,139 --> 01:47:04,499
A witchcraft drew me hither.

1025
01:47:05,059 --> 01:47:10,099
That most ingrateful boy
there by your side,

1026
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:14,979
His life I gave him !
For his sake ...

1027
01:47:16,099 --> 01:47:18,519
- ... faced the danger
of this adverse town !

1028
01:47:18,537 --> 01:47:19,337
How can this be?

1029
01:47:19,438 --> 01:47:20,338
When came he to this town?

1030
01:47:20,439 --> 01:47:24,539
Yester-day, my lord; and for three months before,
Both day and night did we keep company.

1031
01:47:26,539 --> 01:47:30,179
Here comes the countess:
now heaven walks on earth.

1032
01:47:32,459 --> 01:47:35,219
But for thee, fellow; fellow,
thy words are madness...

1033
01:47:35,459 --> 01:47:37,539
Three months this youth
hath tended upon me.

1034
01:47:40,259 --> 01:47:40,939
Bring him away.

1035
01:48:00,299 --> 01:48:03,059
What would my lord,
but that he may not have?

1036
01:48:03,539 --> 01:48:05,859
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.

1037
01:48:10,939 --> 01:48:13,499
- Gracious Olivia ...
- What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord -

1038
01:48:14,619 --> 01:48:16,579
My lord would speak;
my duty hushes me.

1039
01:48:21,179 --> 01:48:23,179
If it be aught
to the old tune, my lord

1040
01:48:23,419 --> 01:48:26,739
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
As howling after music.

1041
01:48:29,619 --> 01:48:32,059
- Still so cruel?
- Still so constant, lord.

1042
01:48:32,659 --> 01:48:36,399
What, to perverseness?
you uncivil lady,

1043
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:41,139
My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath
breathed out that e'er devotion tender'd!

1044
01:48:43,419 --> 01:48:48,179
- What shall I do?
- Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.

1045
01:48:48,459 --> 01:48:53,299
Why should I not, in savage jealousy like to the
Egyptian thief at point of death, kill what I love?

1046
01:48:53,499 --> 01:48:54,619
But Madam, hear me this:

1047
01:48:55,659 --> 01:48:58,179
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,

1048
01:48:58,819 --> 01:49:01,779
Live you the marble-breasted
tyrant still;

1049
01:49:02,739 --> 01:49:07,139
But this your minion, whom I know you love,
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,

1050
01:49:07,419 --> 01:49:09,699
Him will I tear out
of that cruel eye,

1051
01:49:09,899 --> 01:49:13,819
And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.

1052
01:49:14,019 --> 01:49:16,619
Come, boy, with me;
my thoughts are ripe in mischief:

1053
01:49:17,619 --> 01:49:19,579
-  Where goes Cesario?
- After him I love ...

1054
01:49:19,779 --> 01:49:23,779
More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.

1055
01:49:24,019 --> 01:49:29,419
- Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
- Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?

1056
01:49:29,619 --> 01:49:32,179
Hast thou forgot thyself?
is it so long?

1057
01:49:32,979 --> 01:49:34,859
- Call forth the holy father !
-  Come, away!

1058
01:49:35,699 --> 01:49:39,939
Whither, my lord?
Cesario, husband, stay !

1059
01:49:45,019 --> 01:49:49,019
- Husband!
- Ay, husband: can he that deny?

1060
01:49:49,299 --> 01:49:54,579
- Her husband, sirrah ?
- No, my lord, not I.

1061
01:49:54,819 --> 01:49:57,419
Fear not, Cesario;
take thy fortunes up !

1062
01:49:57,699 --> 01:49:58,939
O, welcome, father!

1063
01:50:00,099 --> 01:50:01,219
Father

1064
01:50:01,779 --> 01:50:06,339
I charge thee, by thy reverence, here to unfold,
though lately we intended to keep in darkness

1065
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:09,459
what thou dost know hath newly
pass'd between this youth and me.

1066
01:50:10,259 --> 01:50:12,699
A contract of
eternal bond of love...

1067
01:50:13,379 --> 01:50:16,179
Confirm'd by mutual
joinder of your hands...

1068
01:50:16,419 --> 01:50:19,219
Strengthen'd by
interchangement of your rings;

1069
01:50:19,419 --> 01:50:22,499
Seal'd in my function,
by my testimony.

1070
01:50:30,499 --> 01:50:33,419
O thou dissembling cub!

1071
01:50:35,459 --> 01:50:39,419
what wilt thou be when time
hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?

1072
01:50:42,419 --> 01:50:44,099
Farewell, and take her...

1073
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:50,179
but direct thy feet where thou and I
henceforth may never meet.

1074
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:53,179
- My lord, I do protest ...
- O, do not swear!

1075
01:50:53,459 --> 01:50:57,139
Hold little faith,
though thou hast too much fear.

1076
01:50:57,819 --> 01:51:01,059
For the love of God, a surgeon!
Send one presently to Sir Toby !

1077
01:51:01,899 --> 01:51:03,819
For the love of God, your help!

1078
01:51:05,219 --> 01:51:10,019
- What's the matter?
- He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too

1079
01:51:10,259 --> 01:51:12,659
I had rather than
forty pound I were at home !

1080
01:51:12,859 --> 01:51:14,419
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?

1081
01:51:14,619 --> 01:51:19,859
The count's gentleman, one Cesario:
he's the very devil incardinate.

1082
01:51:20,179 --> 01:51:23,739
- My gentleman, Cesario?
- 'Od's lifelings, here he is!

1083
01:51:24,019 --> 01:51:27,459
You broke my head for nothing; and that
that I did, I was set on to do't by Sir Toby.

1084
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:31,699
I never hurt you:
You drew your sword upon me without cause!

1085
01:51:31,939 --> 01:51:37,339
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have
hurt me: Here comes Sir Toby halting

1086
01:51:37,539 --> 01:51:40,899
If he had not been in drink, he would have
tickled you othergates than he did !

1087
01:51:45,819 --> 01:51:49,659
- How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
- That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end on't.

1088
01:51:49,859 --> 01:51:56,179
- Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
- O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone.

1089
01:51:56,659 --> 01:51:57,539
I hate a drunken rogue.

1090
01:51:57,618 --> 01:51:58,718
Away with him!

1091
01:51:59,219 --> 01:52:00,899
Who hath made this havoc with them?

1092
01:52:01,099 --> 01:52:03,499
I'll help you, Sir Toby,
because well be dressed together.

1093
01:52:03,699 --> 01:52:05,459
Will you help me ?

1094
01:52:07,019 --> 01:52:10,179
an ass-head ... and a coxcomb ?

1095
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:15,459
and a knave, a thin-faced knave!

1096
01:52:16,779 --> 01:52:17,779
A gull !

1097
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:34,099
Get him to bed,
and let his hurt be look'd to.

1098
01:52:48,699 --> 01:52:53,419
I am sorry, madam,
I have hurt your kinsman.

1099
01:52:53,659 --> 01:52:57,579
But, had it been the brother of my blood,
I must have done no less with wit and safety.

1100
01:53:00,499 --> 01:53:04,019
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
We made each other but so late ago.

1101
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:11,619
Antonio!

1102
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:18,339
O my dear Antonio! How have the hours rack'd
and tortured me, since I have lost thee!

1103
01:53:18,539 --> 01:53:23,899
- Sebastian ... are you?
-  Fear'st thou that, Antonio?

1104
01:53:25,339 --> 01:53:27,499
How have you made division of yourself?

1105
01:53:29,539 --> 01:53:31,179
Which is Sebastian?

1106
01:53:42,459 --> 01:53:44,139
Most wonderful!

1107
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:47,219
Do I stand there?

1108
01:53:50,139 --> 01:53:51,339
I never had a brother

1109
01:53:55,779 --> 01:54:00,939
but I had a sister, whom the blind waves
and surges have devour'd.

1110
01:54:03,659 --> 01:54:05,819
Of charity, what kin are you to me?

1111
01:54:08,219 --> 01:54:09,259
What countryman?

1112
01:54:10,619 --> 01:54:14,219
what name? what parentage?

1113
01:54:14,459 --> 01:54:19,659
Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;

1114
01:54:22,099 --> 01:54:24,419
Such a Sebastian was my brother too,

1115
01:54:27,339 --> 01:54:30,459
So went he suited to his watery tomb:

1116
01:54:31,619 --> 01:54:34,939
Were you a woman,
as the rest goes even...

1117
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:39,339
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,

1118
01:54:41,939 --> 01:54:42,859
and say :

1119
01:54:45,139 --> 01:54:48,899
'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'

1120
01:54:51,859 --> 01:54:54,899
My father had a mole upon his brow.

1121
01:54:55,139 --> 01:54:56,099
And so had mine.

1122
01:54:58,419 --> 01:55:02,459
And died that day
when Viola from her birth  ...

1123
01:55:02,659 --> 01:55:04,979
... That day that made my sister thirteen years.

1124
01:55:07,579 --> 01:55:10,699
If nothing lets to make us happy both

1125
01:55:11,899 --> 01:55:16,779
But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
Do not embrace me ...

1126
01:55:17,699 --> 01:55:22,139
till each circumstance
Of place, time, fortune, do cohere ...

1127
01:55:22,779 --> 01:55:24,619
... and jump I am ..

1128
01:55:30,779 --> 01:55:31,779
Viola ...

1129
01:55:42,939 --> 01:55:47,139
which to confirm,
I'll bring you to a captain

1130
01:55:47,659 --> 01:55:50,659
by whose gentle help
I was preserved...

1131
01:55:52,819 --> 01:55:55,179
to serve this noble count.

1132
01:55:59,459 --> 01:56:01,699
So comes it, lady,
you have been mistook

1133
01:56:08,699 --> 01:56:11,139
But nature to her bias drew in that.

1134
01:56:13,099 --> 01:56:15,259
You would have been
contracted to a maid;

1135
01:56:21,499 --> 01:56:23,779
Nor are you therein,
by my life, deceived,

1136
01:56:25,179 --> 01:56:28,659
You are betroth'd
both to a maid and man.

1137
01:56:40,939 --> 01:56:45,099
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,

1138
01:56:46,099 --> 01:56:49,579
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.

1139
01:56:56,699 --> 01:56:57,659
Boy,

1140
01:57:00,659 --> 01:57:04,979
Thou hast said to me a thousand times
thou never shouldst love woman like to me.

1141
01:57:05,379 --> 01:57:08,299
And all those sayings will I overswear;

1142
01:57:09,699 --> 01:57:11,019
Give me thy hand;

1143
01:57:12,939 --> 01:57:14,499
Your master quits you;

1144
01:57:15,699 --> 01:57:20,019
and for your service done him,
So much against the mettle of your sex,

1145
01:57:22,099 --> 01:57:23,579
Here is my hand

1146
01:57:25,859 --> 01:57:27,699
you shall from this time be

1147
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:31,499
Your master's mistress.

1148
01:57:40,979 --> 01:57:45,459
And let me see thee
in thy woman's weeds.

1149
01:57:58,459 --> 01:58:00,939
A sister! you are she.

1150
01:58:28,419 --> 01:58:29,539
From Malvolio?

1151
01:58:48,099 --> 01:58:50,699
What now? Malvolio?

1152
01:58:56,659 --> 01:59:01,099
Madam, you have done me wrong,
Notorious wrong.

1153
01:59:01,979 --> 01:59:03,139
Have I, Malvolio? no.

1154
01:59:05,139 --> 01:59:08,739
Lady, you have.
Pray you, peruse that letter.

1155
01:59:11,699 --> 01:59:16,859
You must not now deny it is your hand.
well, grant it then !

1156
01:59:17,499 --> 01:59:19,819
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,

1157
01:59:20,499 --> 01:59:24,379
Why you have given me
such clear lights of favour ?

1158
01:59:25,179 --> 01:59:29,139
bade me come smiling
and cross-garter'd to you,

1159
01:59:30,259 --> 01:59:35,379
And, acting this in an obedient hope,

1160
01:59:36,499 --> 01:59:40,699
Why have you suffer'd me
to be imprison'd, kept in a dark house,

1161
01:59:41,539 --> 01:59:47,499
visited by the priest,
And made the most notorious geck ...

1162
01:59:47,699 --> 01:59:51,099
and gull that e'er invention
play'd on? tell me...

1163
01:59:52,659 --> 01:59:53,619
... Why?

1164
01:59:56,099 --> 02:00:00,219
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,

1165
02:00:03,019 --> 02:00:06,499
Though, I confess,
much like the character

1166
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:12,179
But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.

1167
02:00:14,499 --> 02:00:17,139
And now I do bethink me, it was she
First told me thou wast mad;

1168
02:00:19,619 --> 02:00:22,819
This practise hath most shrewdly
pass'd upon thee;

1169
02:00:23,019 --> 02:00:26,499
Good madam, hear me speak,

1170
02:00:29,259 --> 02:00:34,539
Most freely I confess, Maria writ
The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;

1171
02:00:35,619 --> 02:00:39,499
In recompense whereof
he hath married her.

1172
02:00:42,659 --> 02:00:47,739
Alas, poor fool,
how have they baffled thee!

1173
02:00:51,139 --> 02:00:53,299
<i>" 'Why, some are born great,  ..."</i>

1174
02:00:54,459 --> 02:00:56,539
<i>"... Some achieve greatness. ..."</i>

1175
02:00:57,299 --> 02:01:00,819
<i>"... And some have greatness thrown upon them. "</i>

1176
02:01:03,539 --> 02:01:07,699
I was one, sir, in this interlude ...

1177
02:01:09,019 --> 02:01:11,379
...one Master Topas.

1178
02:01:14,099 --> 02:01:16,099
<i>'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'</i>

1179
02:01:17,939 --> 02:01:23,219
But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'

1180
02:01:33,339 --> 02:01:34,699
And thus the whirligig of time  ...

1181
02:01:37,979 --> 02:01:39,899
... brings in his revenges.

1182
02:01:55,019 --> 02:01:56,619
I'll be revenged ...

1183
02:02:03,539 --> 02:02:05,899
on the whole pack of you.

1184
02:02:26,179 --> 02:02:28,059
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.

1185
02:02:34,659 --> 02:02:39,939
<i>When that I was and a little tiny boy,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</i>

1186
02:02:41,299 --> 02:02:46,659
<i>A foolish thing was but a toy,
For the rain it raineth every day.</i>

1187
02:02:49,299 --> 02:02:55,059
<i>But when I came to man's estate,
With hey, ho, &c.</i>

1188
02:02:56,339 --> 02:02:58,939
<i>'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,</i>

1189
02:02:59,139 --> 02:03:02,339
<i>For the rain it raineth every day.</i>

1190
02:03:06,539 --> 02:03:09,619
He hath been most notoriously abused.

1191
02:03:10,339 --> 02:03:14,659
No, it is done and golden time convents.

1192
02:03:15,779 --> 02:03:19,659
A solemn combination shall be made
Of our dear souls.

1193
02:03:21,179 --> 02:03:26,939
<i>But when I came, alas! to wive,
With hey, ho, &c.</i>

1194
02:03:28,099 --> 02:03:33,539
<i>By swaggering could I never thrive,
For the rain, &c.</i>

1195
02:03:37,499 --> 02:03:40,299
<i>But when I came unto my beds,</i>

1196
02:03:40,499 --> 02:03:43,219
<i>With hey, ho, &c.</i>

1197
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:47,179
<i>With toss-pots still had drunken heads,</i>

1198
02:03:47,419 --> 02:03:50,459
<i>For the rain, &c.</i>

1199
02:04:58,859 --> 02:05:04,659
<i>A great while ago the world begun, 2620
With hey, ho, &c.</i>

1200
02:05:05,699 --> 02:05:11,859
<i>But that's all one, our play is done,
And we'll strive to please you every day.</i>

1201
02:05:16,499 --> 02:05:20,099
<i>And I'll strive to please you every day.</i>

1202
02:05:26,099 --> 02:05:27,099
<i>Every day.</i>

1203
02:05:31,179 --> 02:05:32,059
<i>Every day.</i>
