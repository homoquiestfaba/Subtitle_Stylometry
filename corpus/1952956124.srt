Good evening, America, I'm Jay Knight.

Our nation is slipping deeper and deeper

and we come to The Jay Knight Hour.

29
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:32,308
My guests tonight are James Taggart,
CEO of Taggart Transcontinental Railroad...

30
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,613
...Wesley Mouch,
a noted Washington lobbyist...

31
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,655

...and Ellis Wyatt,
the o and gas entrepreneur...

33
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,387
...who is responsible
for the current economic boom in Colorado.

34
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,024
My first question is to Mr. Taggart.

35
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,066
Sir, your company
is one of the few managing to survive...

36
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,067
...ln our current economic downturn.

37
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:55,072
Yet, there have been dozens of derailments
on your lines in the last year alone.

38
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,368
How do you explain that?

39
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,738
TAGGART: With any growth
there can be growing pains.

40
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,643
People shouldn't have to worry about how
they're gonna get where they need to go.

41
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,909
We must act
to benefit society as a who e.

42
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,383
WYATT: People aren't gonna
be going anywhere without oll.

43
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:12,355
That means the railroads like Mr. Taggart's
need to be flxing their railways here...

44
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,551
JOY: Can I get you something?
MAN: A cup of coffee.

45
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,593
KNIGHT:
He makes a very good point, Mr. Taggart.

46
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,391
Do you have any money?
I got plenty of money.

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,892
Taggart Transcontinental
is committed to sharing the burden...

48
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,265
JOY:
Hey, what happened to you?

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,741
Who's John Galt?
WYATT: We don't need more rail lines.

50
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,935
We just need the ones we have
to be rellable.

51
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,608
Well, prices are too high.
We have a nation in crsis.

52
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,720
Every business must lend a help ng hand,
Mr. Wyatt.

53
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:46,182
Gasol ne prices
are 37.50 a gallon.

54
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,295

creating a worldwide o shortage.

55
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,694
WYATT: We have plenty of oil
right here In the U.S.

56
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:53,890
Hello, Joy.

57
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,968
WYATT: But because of political
shenanigans and back room deals...

58
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,900
One slice of cherry pie. As usual.

59
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,597
MIDAS:
Punctual, as always. Thank you, dear.

60
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:05,871
And Taggart Transcontinental is providlng
Wyatt Oil excellent rall transportation...

61
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,310
...ln orderto get his oll to the people.

62
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,473
WYATT:
Your Rio Norte Line is so incompetent...

63
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,141
...that I've had to switch
to the Phoenlx/Durango.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,255
After years of excellent service from us.
WYATT: From yourfather.

65
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,256
Slnce you've taken the reins,
that company's gone downhill.

66
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:24,625
Oil prices have caused consumers
to be less reliant on trucks...

67
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,824
Stay dry now.
JOY: See you tomorrow, Mr. Mull gan.

68
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,095
MOUCH: They've gone to the railroads
for the benefits that they provide.

69
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,765
WYATT: People can't count on companies
llke Taggart Transcontinental to dellver.

70

MAN:
Midas Mul gan?

71
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,344
Who's asking?

72
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,009
Someone who knows what it's ike
to work for himself...

73
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,951
...and not let others feed off the profits
of h s energy.

74
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,852
That's funny.

75
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,016
Exact y what I've been thinking.

76
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,291
We're a ike, you and I.

77
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,493
Who are you?

78
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,501
(RINGING)

79
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,686
Eddie.

80
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,025
What? No. Uh...

81
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,361
Hold on. Hold on.

82
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,727
MAN 1 (ON TV): The Dow Jones stock
average dipped under 4000 points today.

83
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,900
This is the deepest one-day drop...

84
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,235
No, not yet. I'm trying another channel.

85
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,073
GRECO (ON TV): Simply one of the worst
railroad accidents in recent history.

86
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,977
A Taggart Transcontinental freight train
has crashed...

87
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,381
...and derailed
in Colorado's Rocky Mountain reglon.

88
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,316
Early reports put much of the blame...

89
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,423
...on the poor conditlon
of the 100-year-old railroad llne.

90
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:03,393
This rail disaster could delay eastbound
oil shipments by at least two weeks.

91
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,158
The accldent is yet another downturn
for Taggart Transcontlnental...

92
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,529
...the largest rallroad remainlng
in the U.S.

93
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,261
I'm on my way in.

94
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,965
TAGGART: I already know about the
derailment on the R o Norte Line, Eddie.

95
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,306
Cance lations.
People are giving up trying to use the line.

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,641
Their bus ness
is going to the Phoenix/Durango.

97
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,410
I have new steel rails coming from...
That order is 13 months old.

98
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,986
The Phoen x/Durango
has cut deep y into our bus ness.

99
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,248
They expect to have Wyatt
as their main account.

100
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,255
He needs us
just as much as we need h m.

101
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,623
Ellis Wyatt has put Taggart
Transcontinental on notice.

102
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,959
He'd rather back og w th any competitor
than ship anything...

103
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,430
Wyatt's a greedy bastard.

104
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,466
We've been serving
the Colorado Reg on...

105
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,436
...since my great-great grandfather ran
this company. What happened to loyalty?

106
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,167
Perhaps the problem is
we haven't updated that branch...

107
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,573
...since your father ran the company.

108
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,274
Are you accusing me
of not do ng my job?

109
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,010
Careful, Eddie,
it's one th ng I learned from my father...

110
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,185
...everyone's expendable.

111
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,292
Let me be very clear, James.

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,984
Colorado s our last hope.

113
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:46,690
If we don't do someth ng about it,
there's not gonna be a railroad.

114
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,334
I'm still the president,
regardless of my s ster...

115
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,094
DAGNY:
Morning.

116
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,807
Eddie, can you give us a minute?

117
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,341
I need to have a conversation
with my brother.

118
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,445
A meeting without your right-hand man?

119
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,812
Must be real important.

120
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,043
I've ordered the replacement rails
from Rearden Steel.

121
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,677
I have a contract with Orren Boyle.
You had a contract with Orren Boyle.

122
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,323
Canceled.
You've no authority.

123
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,619
As much authority as you had
to do a backdoor deal with Orren Boyle.

124
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,887
There are consequences
to this accident, Jim.

125
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:21,500
We have to service Ell s Wyatt.
He is this company's main priorty.

126
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,727
You just ove
to keep feeding the monopolies.

127
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,371
You keep pissing off
the heart of this operation...

128
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,134
...Wyatt s gonna stop providing the blood
we need to keep this company alive.

129
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,210
You understand that?
Why Rearden Steel?

130
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,370
There are companies
that need the money.

131
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:38,005
It's his new meta.
That metal's complete y untested.

132
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,915
The consensus of the best metallurgical
authorities are h ghly skept ca.

133
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,851
I'm not interested in their opinions.

134
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,419
Then who's do you go by?
My own.

135
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,227
And what on earth do you know
about Rearden Metal?

136
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,594
It is tougher, cheaper,
lighter than stee...

137
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,861
...and will outlast any metal in ex stence.

138
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,061
Says who?

139
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,173
I studied engineering in college, Jim.

140
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,536
When see things, I see them.
What'd you see?

141
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,111
Rearden's p ans, research he's done.
This is the greatest metal on the market.

142
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,113
Dagny, nobody's used Rearden Metal.
We will.

143
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,844
Why do we have to be the first?
Do you wanna save Colorado or not?

144
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,580
I'm not taking respons bility
for any of this.

145
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,384
You don't have to take responsibility, J m.
I will.

146
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,121
Just know that this is the consequence
of your policies.

147
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,621
Which policies?

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,860
Your 13-month experiment
with Orren Boyle, for one.

149
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,765
The Mexican catastrophe, for another.

150
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,428
The bottom ine is that...

151
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,598
...we are going to fix the Rio Norte Line
with Rearden Meta.

152
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,644
I'm going to Philadelphia tonight
to f nalize the dea with Hank Rearden.

153
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,806
You're lucky.
What?

154
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,382
Other people are human.

155
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,452
They're sensitive.

156
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,817
They can't just dedicate their whole lives
to metals and engines.

157
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,484
You've never had any feelings.

158
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,491
I don't think you've everfe t a thing.

159
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,487
No, Jim.

160
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,326
I guess I've never felt anything at all.

00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,685
And it's very n ce.

166
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,663
Gwen, it's beaut ful.

167
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,702
You have more messages, Mr. Rearden.

168
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,736
National Council of Metal Industries.

169
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,397
File it.

170
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,009
The State Science Institute.
File it.

171
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,041
(CHUCKLES)

172
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,553
Your ast appointment of the day is here.

173
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,718
Miss Taggart?

174
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,655
He'll see you now.

175
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,230
Mr. Rearden?

176
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,428
Miss Taggart.

177
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,339
If you're here for your rails...

178
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,067
...they won't be tempered
and cooled for a few days.

179
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,938
I'm just here to discuss our deal.

180
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,039
Please, sit.

181
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,446
So, what's the premium
to rush thesee rails?

182
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,550
Forty thousand dollars a ton.

183
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,626
That's the best price you can g ve me?
I could charge you double and you'd pay.

184
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,126
You could.

185
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,025
And I wou d.

186
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,123
But you won't.
Why won't I?

187
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,099
You need to have the Rio Norte rerailed
with your new metal.

188
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,761
It will be its first showcase.

189
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,635
And I'm gambling your new metal can do
what you say it can.

190
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,299
I'm staking my business on it.

191
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,411
I know what you mean.

192
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,771
Like I said, we need each other.

193
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:35,149
So if you can have the Rio Norte
complete y rera ed in nine months...

194
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,312
...I w give you $20,000 a ton.

195
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,821
Deal.

196
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,224
I'm curious.

197
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,659
Is t all right with you...

198
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,324
...that I'm squeezing every penny of profit
I can from your emergency?

199
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,494
I have to get the Rio Norte
complete y rera ed in nine months...

200
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,799
...or Taggart Transcontinental w I crash.

201
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,169
Doing their best
to make it harder for you.

202
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,641
Yes, but it's useless
to get angry wth people...

203
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,076
...ike my brother
and his friends in Washington.

204
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,479
I don't have time for it.
I have to undo what they've done.

205
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,415
And after?

206
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,317
After, they won't matter anyway.

207
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,981
I was just heading out myself.

208
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,854
Can I wa k you to your car?

209
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,684
DAGNY:
Do you need a ride?

210
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,696
No, thank you.
I walk home most nights.

211
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,993
It gives me a chance to think.

212
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,265
Well, I hope that doesn't catch on.

213
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,598
It would put me out of business.

214
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,535
If your new metal works,
have you thought of the implications?

215
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,442
Yeah. Their uses are almost endless.

216
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,878
Naval ships, armor plating,
even spacecraft.

217
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:44,012
Can you imagine a commercial jet
twice the size with half the weight?

218
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,385
Commercial airlines.

219
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,487
You real y do wanna put me
out of business, huh?

220
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,586
PHILLIP: Remember, there was 20 peop e...
LILLIAN: I love this.

221
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,094
I can't be ieve I did this.
And then...

222
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,255
Well, look who's finally home.

223
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,401
Henry,
Paul's been waiting here for hours.

224
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,934
Hello, Henry.
HENRY: Hey, Pau.

225
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,163
I know. I'm late.
Could have called.

226
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,867
Henry, do you mind hold ng
the 10th of December open for me?

227
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,705
That's three months away.

228
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,074
I don't know what I'm doing next week.

229
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,944
We started a major new pour today.
Oh, cheers.

230
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,450
It's our wedding anniversary, Henry.
December 10th?

231
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,748
Henry isn't nterested
in anything that doesn't tie in to his work.

232
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,618
I know that you are very busy...

233
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,386
...but I would very much ike
for ycu to be there.

234
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,121
Of course, Lillian. I'll be there.
Thank you, dear.

235
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,889
I want it to be spec al.

236
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,966
Everyone will be there.

237
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,693
REARDEN:
Have you had any dinner, Henry?

238
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,771
No, I was busy working,
but I'm not hungry anyway.

239
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,567
That's the trouble w th you.
You work too hard.

240
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,803
Mm.

241
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:17,412
Ooh. What is this?

242
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,781
I had it made
from the first pour of Rearden Metal.

243
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,820
You're giving me a ra road spike?

244
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,496
It's wonderful. T is.

245
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,826
It's original.

246
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,596
I'll be the toast of the town
wear ng a p ece of the same metal...

247
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:43,731
...used to bu d railroads and bridges
and sewer pipes and oi tanks and...

248
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,104
You are so self sh, Henry.

249
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,644
Oh. Phillip, it is not the gift,
it's the inteention.

250
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,510
The intention's pure selfishness,
it seeems to mee.

251
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,016
I mean, another man wou d have given
h s wfe a diamond bracelet...

252
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:57,179
...if he wanted to g ve her a gift
for her pleasure, not his.

253
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,948
No. The, uh, chain is approprate.

254
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,652
I think it's the chain
by which he holds us al in bondage.

255
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,796
Henry's poured his metal today
and I have the first trophy.

256
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,991
It's sweet.

257
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,863
It's pathetic, Lilly.

258
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,664
Thank you.

259
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,977
LILLIAN: I hope you didn't come here
for anyth ng.

260
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,545
Henry.
Ph ip.

261
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,374
What are you doing with yourself
these days?

262
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,644
I'm working
for Frends of Global Awareness.

263
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,883
I know them.

264
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,047
What do you want?
Money.

265
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,658
Doesn't everyone?

266
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,999
Call my office first thing in the morning.
I'll authorize a hundred grand for you.

267
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,068
You don't care
about he ping the underprvileged.

268
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,902
No, Phill p, I don't,
but it will make you happy.

269
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,067
It's not for me, Hank.

270
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,009
It's for the benefit of the less privileged.

271
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,582
Do you think I can have the money w red
to my account?

272
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,082
A wire? Why?

273
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,244
Well, the th ng is
it's a progress ve group.

274
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,753
They wouldn't appreciate your name
on a check.

275
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,991
You're k dd ng me.

276
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,926
No. T wou d embarrass us
to have you on the ist of our contributors.

277
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,693
LARKIN: You shouldn't have given Phlllip
that money.

278
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,830
By the way,
I don't care what the industry says, Henry.

279
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,201
Rearden Metal, it's terrfic.

280
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,673
I just hope
you don't run into any trouble.

281
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:25,868
What trouble?

282
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,411
Well, you're not very popu ar, Hank.

283
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,913
I haven't had any comp aints
from my customers.

284
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,574
Yeah? That's not what I mean.

285
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,220
You know what you should do?

286
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,119
You ought to get yourself a good
press agent to sell you to the public.

287
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,886
It's my metal I'm sell ng. Not me.
Thank you.

288
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,964
But you don't want the pub ic against you.
Public opinion, you know, can mean a lot.

289
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,466
As far as I can tell, it doesn't mean
a damn thing, one way or another.

290
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,131
The press is against you.

291
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,629
They have time to waste. I don't.

292
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,139
Well, they say you're intractable,
you're ruthless.

293
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,800
Your only goal is to make money.

294
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,909
My only goa is to make money.

295
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,072
Yeah, but you shouldn't say it.

296
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:09,249
Hank, I'm on your side.

297
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,582
How's your man in Washington?

298
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,556
Wesley Mouch?

299
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,959
Well, he's fine, I suppose.
Good.

300
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,895
It's important
that your man in Washington is fine.

301
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,571
What are you try ng to imply, Paul?

302
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,070
Is there something going on
that I shou d know about?

303
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,142
No. It's nothing.

304
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,678
It's just you don't know
who's loyal these days.

305
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,985
What is wrong with the word, Paul?

306
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,355
Why ask useless questions?

307
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,018
How deep is the ocean?

308
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,523
How high s the sky?

309
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,618
Who is John Galt?

310
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:00,772
Henry Rearden claims that his steel is
lighter than even the cheapest brands...

311
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,034
...but it's 10 times stronger.
This is physically mpossible, Jim.

312
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,043
You're nv ting disaster if you use t.
Dagny is, not me.

313
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,204
Well, something has to be done.

314
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,508
Agreed.

315
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:14,141
I be ieve you know Wesley Mouch,
Rearden's man in Washington.

316
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,151
You know what I like about you, Wesley?

317
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,882
You're a one-word man.
True.

318
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:22,391
BOYLE: All right, something has got
to be done about the iron ore shortage.

319
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,496
It threatens
the very existence of the stee industry.

320
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,566
I don't think it's fair
that one company has its own supply.

321
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,224
Rearden Steel.
BOYLE: Exact y.

322
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:35,067
It's not n the public interest
to let one man destroy an ent re industry.

323
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,904
If we're gonna bring Rearden down
we shou d do it from the inside.

324
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,412
MOUCH:
Under my guidance, of course.

325
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,744
The Nat onal Council of Metal Industries
has completed a report...

326
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,751
...that draws public opinion
against Rearden Metal.

327
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,754
Excuse me. I just wanna make sure
that Hank doesn't get hurt.

328
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,482
Paul, it's his own fault.

329
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,718
He's not exactly open to compet tion.

330
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,363
A monopo y. To be exact.

331
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,896
BOYLE:
We are work ng on a bill.

332
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,660
It's ca ed
The Equalization of Opportun ty.

333
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,099
It proposes to limit
the number of businesses...

334
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,570
...that any one person owns
to one business.

335
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,005
However,
we're gonna need your help, Jimmy.

336
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,510
We need you
to grease the palms of your politicians...

337
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,444
...in order to get legislation
we're spearheading passed.

338
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,948
What will Taggart Transcontinental
get in return?

339
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,781
I can see to it that the exclus ve grip...

340
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,015
...that Dan Conway's Phoenix/Durango
railroad has in Co orado...

341
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,625
...can come to a halt.

342
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,423
Paul, th s is not personal.

343
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,963
MOUCH: Everybody needs to share
the burdens we facee.

344
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,794
Espec ally Rearden.

345
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,630
(GROUP LAUGHING)

346
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,608
MOUCH: Isn't that Francisco D'Anconia?
BOYLE: That's him.

347
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:50,138
Francsco.
BOYLE: Throwing away his daddy's money.

348
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,086
Did you get in on that ore mine deal
in Meex co?

349
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,278
We all did.

350
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,913
He may be a slacker, but he makes
business investments that pay off.

351
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,720
Well, that's it for me, gentlemen.
I have to go too.

352
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,726
Um, Mr. Taggart. Orren.

353
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,128
Uh, Pau, uh,
maybe you'd like a lift in my I mo?

354
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,595
Of course. Thank you.

355
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,466
Please. This way.
Gentlemen.

356
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,163
TAGGART: Good night, Paul.
MOUCH: Orren.

357
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,933
Wesley.

358
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,313
Jim? What is it?

359
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,485
Well, if he's such a great bus nessman...

360
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,680
...then why hasn't a single train
filled with ore left Mexico yet?

361
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,015
Isn't that what we invested in?

362
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:37,356
BOYLE: D'Ancon a has invested b lions
developing their infrastructure.

363
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,693
But he also bought in himself.

364
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:41,992
He must know something.

365
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:45,194
TAGGART: What are you thinking?
BOYLE: I think t's the ore reserves.

366
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,362
I think they must be huge.

367
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,533
Well, the success of my Mexican expansion
depends on those m nes, Orren.

368
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,305
Uh, sure.

369
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,938
This t me next year,
Phoenix/Durango needs to be a memory.

370
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,780
Thank you, Mr. McNamara.
I ook forward to working with you as well.

371
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,219
McNAMARA: Frankly,
I appreciate working directly with you.

372
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,018
DAGNY: My pleasure. Goodbye.
McNAMARA: Goodbye.

373
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,285
Who was that?

374
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,191
I found an excellent contractor to takeover
the rebuilding of the Rio Norte Line.

375
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,388
That was quick.

376
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,161
You'd be surprised how quickly things
get done when you do some actual work...

377
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,668
...and don't re y on political favors.

378
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,245
Is this accurate? Just one passenger tra n
per day on the Mexican ine?

379
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,408
And one freight every other n ght?
Yes.

380
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,713
How are the Mex cans gonna
deve op the area...

381
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,152
...with a s ngle passenger train
once a day?

382
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,757
They're not, J m.

383
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,190
You should know I moved everything
of va ue out of Mexico a month ago.

384
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,024
There's nothing for looters
once the Mexicans nat onalize.

385
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,895
That Mexican line was helping those
destitute people get back in the game.

386
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,565
And it was great PR for this company.

387
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,933
I would have happily
put a rai road in Mexico...

388
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,769
...f there was
a reason to build up the region...

389
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,834
...but I d dn't see one.

390
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,709
You can't just take everyth ng away
from people who need our help.

391
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,342
Move.
Okay.

392
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,853
Miss Taggart?
Oh. Hello, Owen, please, have a seat.

393
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,582
OWEN:
Thank you.

394
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:16,953
Um...

395
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:22,290
I've have come to give you my resignation.
Effective immediate y.

396
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,133
Why?
For a personal reason.

397
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,101
Are you dissatisf ed here?
No.

398
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,207
Have you received a better offer?
No.

399
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,639
I'm sorry, I don't understand, are you II?
No.

400
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,937
Are you leaving the city?
No.

401
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,877
But you no longer wish to work
for Taggart Transcontinenta?

402
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,381
Miss Taggart, I assure you...

403
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,748
...um, no person, matter
or event connected to my job...

404
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,482
...has anything to do
with my decision to leave.

405
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,825
I actually ca ed you in here today
to offer you a promotion.

406
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,963
I wanted you to manage
the Rio Norte Line.

407
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:57,001
That's very kind of you, M ss Taggart...

408
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,263
...but, um, my dec sion has been made.

409
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,104
I' double what any other railroad
is offering.

410
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,004
I won't be working for any railroad.

411
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,340
But you will be working?
Yes, um...

412
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,079
Look, I came to tell you I'm leaving...

413
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:16,017
...because I promised you once that I would
and I wanna keep my word.

414
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,855
Write your own ticket, Owen.

415
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,929
Name your prce.

416
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,025
I want you to stay.

417
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:31,963
I'm sorry, Miss Taggart.

418
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,370
So there's nothing I can offer you?

419
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,035
Noth ng, nothing on Earth.

420
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,207
I'm sorry, Owen, I have to ask
and I'd I ke the truth.

421
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,541
Why are you leaving?

422
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,381
Who is John Galt?

423
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,359
(SIGHS)

424
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,698
All done then?

425
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:12,741
Where are you going?
I have some work to do.

426
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,176
Fix me a drink?
Of course.

(PHONE RINGING)

428
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,873
Miss Taggart?

429
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,537
Am I calling too ate?

430
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,075
Not at all. What's go ng on?

431
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,277
Nothing.

432
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,445
Well, um...

433
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,557
...something.

434
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,625
I don't know
why I thought of calling you.

435
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,955
HENRY (OVER PHONE):
It's flne, Dagny.

436
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,289
What happened?

437
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,562
One of my best employees quit today.

438
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,427
Owen Kellogg.

439
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,129
I was actually grooming him
for a management position...

440
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:19,107
...and he just up and left.

441
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,609
He cou dn't even tell me why.

442
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,303
He just sa d:

443
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,919
Why are so many
great men disappearing?

444
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,293
It's going to be okay, Dagny.

445
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,160
You know, when you say that,
I actually believe it.

446
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,298
HENRY:
Dagny, what we're doing...

447
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:44,168
...my metal, your railway...

448
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,334
It's us who move the world...

449
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,735
...and It's us who will pull It through.

450
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:49,931
I know.

451
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,275
Goodnight.

452
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,004
Goodnight.

453
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,419
Richard McNamara?

454
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,961
I'm McNamara.

455
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,191
Are you here
from Taggart Transcontinental?

456
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,459
No, I'm not.

457
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,337
What are you selling, pal?

458
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:24,340
Nothing, I'm simply offering a society
that cult vates individua ach evement.

459
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,375
I know where such a p ace exists.

460
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,046
BOYLE (OVER PHONE):
And then we do what?

461
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:43,388
We say its purpose is to prevent destruct ve
competition between ra Iroads.

462
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,790
We build public opinion...

463
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,557
...against encroachment
on existing train routes then...

464
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,566
And then the Nat onal Alliance of Ra Iroads
proposes a rule.

465
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:52,704
The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule.

466
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,338
Every member must subordinate...

467
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,373
...his own nterests
for the collective needs of the industry.

468
00:27:57,543 --> 00:28:01,741
But, in fact, we're squeezing
Dan Conway out of Colorado.

469
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,179
You are think ng
like a po itician, Jimmy.

470
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,995
WOMAN (ON TV): Mexican authorities
seized land throughout the country today.

471
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,062
Most affected
were the San Sebastian Mlnes...

472
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,665
...where international playboy
Francisco D'Anconia...

473
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,734
...and other investors,
including Taggart Transcontinental...

474
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,100
...and Associated Steel
have reportedly lost billions.

475
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,443
The San Sebast an Line has been seized
by the Mexican government.

476
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:39,209
It's been national zed
as Dagny predicted.

477
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:42,618
An emergency board meeting
has been ca ed.

478
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,856
TAGGART: I can assure you
that there is no need for panic.

479
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,291
And have fu I confidence
that our government...

480
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,125
...will negotiate
an equitable settlement with Mexico.

481
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,597
I foresaw the poss bility
of this type of event...

482
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:01,432
...and took every precaution to protect
the interests of Taggart Transcont nental.

483
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,474
Severa months ago, ordered Operations
to cut the schedulee...

484
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,635
...on the San Sebastian Line
down to a s ngle train a day...

485
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,078
...and to remove everyth ng of value
from Mexico.

486
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,808
Now, because of my actions...

487
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,818
...b I ions of company dollars
have been saved.

489
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,317
No, this is no trick.
I checked it al out, Jimmy.

490
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,828
D'Ancon a used h s own cash
and now he has lost t all in those mines.

491
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:30,491
He is too smart for that.
He must have something up his sleeve.

492
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,638
Well, let's hope so.
What do your friends n Washington think?

493
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,569
They don't know anything.
Well, he knows something.

494
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,438
And we need to find out what it is
and get in on t too.

495
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,910
Ruth Anne, why haven't you gotten me
a meeting with D'Anconia yet?

496
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,675
RUTH ANNE: I wasn't able to get a meeting.
Why not?

497
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:49,685
RUTH ANNE: Senor D'Anconia says
that you bore him, Mr. Taggart.

498
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,252
Yeah, okay, yeah.
There's someth ng e se, Dagny.

00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:59,659
There was a call just now
from the Rio Norte branch in Colorado.

500
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,856
Richard McNamara
never showed up for work.

501
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,092
Well, go f nd h m.

502
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,862
EDDIE:
Well, we've looked and we found a note.

503
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,306
DAGNY: What did it say?
It said, "'Who s John Ga t?"

504
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,876
What does that mean?
EDDIE: Was explained once.

505
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,036
"Don't ask quest ons
nobody can answer."

506
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,812
Can you get Hank Rearden for me?
EDDIE: He actually called earlier.

507
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,782
He's in town and he wants to know
if you're availab e.

508
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,388
And what did you say?

509
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,717
EDDIE:
He's meeting you at 4:30.

510
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,524
Thanks, Eddie.

511
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,505
We need to talk.
You guys carry on, I'll catch up.

512
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,002
You think I've ruined this company.

513
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,841
Do you and Orren Boyle have a plan for
making up for the Mexican line's losses?

514
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,984
Yes, I do.
The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule.

515
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,415
Wyatt will have
to use Taggart Transcontinental...

516
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,817
...because we will be the only railroad
in town.

517
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:02,688
The Phoenix/Durango is a good line, Jim.
Conway put h s lifeblood into its success.

518
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,853
You have to take radica steps to surv ve.
What does that mean?

519
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,931
Go see your o d boyfriend, Francisco...

520
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,762
...find out why he screwed us out
of b ions of dollars?

521
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,432
It will never happen.

522
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,233
You'll never open those old wounds.

523
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,908
DAGNY:
Get me Dan Conway.

524
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:26,777
I'm El s Wyatt.

525
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,947
How can I help you?
WYATT: I'll make this qu ck.

526
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:35,051
I came here today
because, well, I met your brother...

527
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:39,061
...and I was hoping someone
in this business still had a brain.

528
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,597
If you and your brother try
to undermine me...

529
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:45,726
...or go to the government like you did
to destroy my best friend, Dan Conway...

530
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,462
Maybe you should let me explain...

531
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,800
Maybe you should let me f nish speaking!

532
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,808
Okay.
EDDIE: Dagny?

533
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,468
Okay.

534
00:31:54,646 --> 00:32:00,414
Now that you have effectively closed down
the Phoenix/Durango railroad line...

535
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:07,081
...because of
this new Anti Dog-Eat-Dog bullshit...

536
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:11,827
...I have no choice but to get back
into business with you Taggarts aga n.

537
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,329
I had nothing to do
with the creation of that bill.

538
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:19,596
I will not lower my business standards
to your ousy level of incompetence.

539
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,262
Shall I explain what I intend to do n...
WYATT: No.

540
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,841
Now that I'm forced to use
your ra road...

541
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,173
...all I want from you
is dependable transportation.

542
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,445
You will get the transportation
you need, Mr. Wyatt.

543
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,781
I prom se you that.

544
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,180
We' see.

545
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,099
Is everything all right, Dagny?

546
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,029
I don't know.

547
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,830
Eddie?
Yes, Dagny?

548
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,970
Can you get me a dinner appointment
with Francisco D'Anconia?

549
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,478
What about Henry Rearden?

550
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,384
I guess I have two dinner dates then.

551
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:20,889
In the end, he's rght.

552
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:25,002
If Wyatt fails, Taggart Transcontinental
and everyone else around h m goes down.

553
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,162
I have 50 miles of my new rail
tempered and ready to roll.

554
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,071
With your new rail, I can triple my load
capacity but I need more diese engines.

555
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:35,077
I barely have enough parts
to keep the ones I have work ng now.

556
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,909
Hmm. Engine parts are hard to come by
these days.

557
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:41,177
I have engines I ordered two years ago
and still have not received.

558
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,049
There was a company that made
terrif c engines years ago...

559
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,213
...uh, in Wiscons n, I think.

560
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:50,919
It closed suddenly, but they might have
machine tools and parts that you can use.

561
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,586
I can look into it f you like.

Did you hear about R chard McNamara?
I did.

569
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:28,364

if this trend continues?

Your brother and his friends
in Washington, people like that.

572
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:35,897
That's depressing.

You knew those mines were worthless.

Why d d I invest?
Can you think of a motive?

You knew they were gonna se ze
those mines, d dn't you?

585
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,189
What you were after
were your American stockholders.

586

Not at all.

Your brother and h s friends know nothing
of the copper min ng industry.

596
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,994
They consider knowledge
to be superf uous.

597
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,903
So you did betray them intentionally?
That's for you to decide.

Matter of fact, I didn't try to sell the mine

You wouldn't have.
Exactly.

You're working for your sake, not the rs.

Yes, they do.
But they don't think you do.

No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.

And we both know why.

738
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,377
It's nothing.
It's just a useless hunk of metal.

Nice try.

on Hank Rearden in his magazine?

768
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,268
And why is there media
at a prvate dinner?

769

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,314
I don't need to defend my dec sion

...until the economy can stabilize.

785
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,990
The answer s no.

At a time of desperate stee shortages...

787
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,866
...we can't afford to allow the expans on

...for the rghts to Rearden Metal.

00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,463
Tel me if Rearden Metal is good or not
and I'll sell you the rights.

798
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:35,607

at a time of great economic uncertainty.

Is Rearden Metal good or not?

800

Answer the quest on, doctor.

801
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:50,583
The question of Rearden Metal
being good or not is rrelevant.

802
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:57,062
If Rearden Metal is not good,
it's a physical danger to the public.

803

If it is good...

804
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,598
...t's a social danger.

805
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,505
If you have any proof that
Rearden Metal poses a physical threat...

806

...show it to me.

807
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,447
Otherwise, we're done here.

808
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:31,193
Why is it so mportant for you to struggle
for years squeezing out meager gains...

809
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,700
...rather than accept a fortune
for Rearden Metal?

810
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,805
Because it's mine.

811
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,770
Do you understand that concept?

812
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:39,307
M ne.

813
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,536
Why are you taking
such a hard-line position?

814
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,771
I don't understand.

815
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:46,007
I don't think you'll ever understand,
doctor.

816
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:53,217
And Rearden Metal is good.

817
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,300
I can't risk mak ng more sw tches
for ycu...

818
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:15,911
...out of that unproven metal.

819
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,707
Too many people think it's unsafe.

820

821
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:22,177
I just don't want any trouble.
Herbert, look.

You've been work ng with Rearden Metal

Who is threatening you?

829
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:45,208
The State Science Inst tute

...even if the words it uses are false?

836
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:04,424
Miss Taggart, it is publ c opinion
that Rearden Metal is unsafe.

837
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:06,290
What about the truth?

838
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:10,929
That Rearden Metal is the best materal
ava lab e on the market today.

839
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,626
It's strong, it is safe. You know that.

840
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,136
Please, have a seat.

841
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:28,247
Please. Cons der my s de, Miss Taggart.

842
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,110
I work for the ast center of science
left on Earth.

843
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,620
We do rely on public funding.

844
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:34,815
Which do I sacrifice?

845
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:38,155
An excellent piece of sme ting
or the future of this institute?

846
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,762
Miss Taggart.

847
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,994
Please sit down.

848
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,275
I had threee brilliant students...

849
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:01,509
...that I shared with another
Ph osophy professor, Hugh Akston.

850
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,245
Doctor Stadler, I don't understand
what this has to do...

851
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,685
We eeven had a bet.

852
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,621
Who would win
over their hearts and minds first?

853
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,927
One of them became a depraved playboy.

854
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,691
His name was Francisco D'Anconia.
I know who he s.

855
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,767
The second, Ragnar Danneskjo d,
became a pirate...

856
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:20,801
...stealing to g ve to the rich.

857
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,700
And the third?

858
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,000
The third one simply vanished.

859
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,543
We were expecting
such a magnificent future for them.

860
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:37,513
I do wish you best of luck, Miss Taggart.

861
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,565
Sorry, I'm late.

862
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,898
Please, continue.

863
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,632
MAN (ON TV):
Today, the Rio Norte Line...

864
00:52:56,807 --> 00:53:00,743
...completed 211 miles of replaced track
using the new Rearden Steel.

865
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,904

new steel, mined with the latest standard...

866

00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,551
WYATT:
Hello, Dagny.

868
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,180
Mr. Wyatt. He o.

869
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,486
There was a big-rig p eup
a couple of weeks ago.

870
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:22,428
Landslide closed down the supp y line
for workers and the rail.

871
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,760
I thought we'd be down
for a couple of weeks.

872
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,403
We were back up and running
in 24 hours.

873
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:32,599
I figured someone
knew how to manage a crsis up here.

874
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,201
Nice job.

875
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,941
Can't afford to fall behind.

876
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:40,242
We have to geet those rai s in place
before the first snows come.

877
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,614
I underestimated you.

878
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,250
Hey, Dagny?

879
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,589
If you ever want a job...

880
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,622
I'll keep that in mind.

881
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,301
MAN 1: It comes from the reservoir.
Make sure it's clean.

882
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:07,567
HENRY: I was watching you
with the workers there.

883
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,578
You look as at home there
as you do in that office of yours.

884
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,773
I'm needed here.

885
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,277
This is important.

886
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:15,976
MAN 2:
Yeah, go ahead.

887
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:18,553
What you need is to replace that brdge.

888
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:19,746
DAGNY:
Not a chance.

889
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,414
I have to be ready in six months.
MAN 3: Plenty.

890
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:26,552
What f I told you I could have it made
in three months...

891
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,563
...and that it would last for ceenturies?

892
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:33,430
Let me check my budget.

893
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,663
I can make it happen.

894
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,466
Now, I'm staying in town ton ght.

895
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,973
I was wondering
if you'd like join me for dinner.

896
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,773
I can't.
I have to get back to New York.

897
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:45,306
But walk with me.

898
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,977
Do you think it can be stopped?

899
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:51,621
HENRY: This new line or us?
DAGNY: Both.

900
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:28,718
What's going on, Edd e?

901
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,887
Ben Nea y's quit.

902
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,190
Kel ogg, McNamara, now Nealy.

903
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,059
That's not all,
Dagny.

904
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,633
Taggart Transcontinental
stocks have plummeted...

905
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:42,533
...because the State Science Inst tute
has denounced Rearden Metal.

906
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,470
Your family's railroad is in rea trouble.

907
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,210
Eddie.

908
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:53,979
I think it's time to stand
on our own.

909
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:01,047
In order to save my family's business...

910
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:04,984
...l'm gonna have to abandon it.

911
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:17,407
SECRETARY:
Good morning, Miss Taggart.

912
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,051
Taggart Transcontinental is done.

913
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,120
What are you ta king about?
We're f nished.

914
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,213
We can't stop and we can't go on.

915
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,450
In weeks.
Our stock won't be trading anymore.

916
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:39,528
You're paranoid. Orren Boy e has assured
me there is pending...

917
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,061
Here's what we are gonna do.

918
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,029
And, J m, this is not a proposal.

919
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:45,793
Just listen and accept.

920
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,370
I'm gonna take a leave
from Taggart Transcontinental.

921
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,302
Start my own company.
You're leaving?

922
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:54,967
Shut up. You and the board are gonna
transfer the Rio Norte L ne over to me.

923
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,407
Our stock will go back up.

924
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,275
I w I act as my own contractor.

925
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:01,576
I wi I get my own financing
and finish the line on t me.

926
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:05,586
And where are you gonna get financing?
That is not for you to worry about.

927
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,485
Once we see how the rails perform...

928
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:10,786
...I will transfer the ine
back over to Taggart Transcontinental...

929
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,656
...and return to my job.

930
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,390
Okay. And what are you gonna call
this new I ne of yours, Dagny?

931
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:19,000
You're not dragging the family name
through this.

932
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,137
I won't allow it.

933
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,773
The John Galt Line.

934
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,178
Now we know
why you've gone off the rails.

935
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:36,478
That's the name.
It's your disaster.

936
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,654
And what's the plan if you fail?

937
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,016
I go down alone.

938
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,488
Taggart Transcontinental
remains in your contro.

939
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:45,518
Two last things.
What?

940
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:47,857
First, I'm taking Eddie W I ers.
Oh, no, no.

941
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,123
I need him here.
Tough.

942
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,028
You're gonna have to do your own work.

943
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,931
Second, keep your cron es in Washington
off my back.

944
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:56,868
Make sure I get a my permissions,
grants, authorizations...

945
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,306
...and any other political crap I need from
those sons of b tches, otherwise, no deal.

946
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:06,477
I'll see what I can do.
And one last warning, brother dear.

947
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:10,382
I have never done anything
to hurt a ving creature in my entire life.

948
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:14,381
But if you double-cross me in any way...

949
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,786
...I w destroy you.

950
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,330
DAGNY:
The money would mean nothing to you.

951
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,233
You've wasted that on sense ess parties.

952
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:31,670
You've wasted more
in the San Sebastian mines.

953
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,571
I'm afraid I can't. Money's tight.

954
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:36,042
I've got too many expenses.
Okay.

955
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,375
So, what do you want me to do, Frisco?
Do you want me to beg?

956
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,847
Because now 'm begging.
Ha.

957
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,043
You don't know how.

958
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,656
I thought that you of all people
would understand.

959
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,397
Then is it me that you want?

960
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:10,269
Don't ask me such a thing, Dagny.

961
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,682
If I ever meant anything to you...

962
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,784
...loan me the money that I need.

963
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:18,880
I can't.

964
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:27,559
What s this savior I ne gonna be ca led?

965
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,465
The John Galt Line.

966
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,462
What?
Because I am tired of hearing that name.

967
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:39,802
It means quitt ng, giving up.

968
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:43,605
And am not giving up.
I am not going to quit.

969
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,780
I'm going to win.

970

MAN:
I'm sorry, Miss Taggart.

971
00:59:57,494 --> 00:59:58,654
So, what do you think?

972
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:00,160
Just one ast thing.

Okay.

I have some good news.

981
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,185
Mr. Rearden, Miss Taggart is...

982
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,126
As president of the John Galt Line...

983
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,665
...I would like to commiss on
a Rearden Metal brdge for Wyatt Junction.

984
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,860
Excellent. I'll start roll ng the metal.

985
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,505
Aren't you curious as to how
I'm able to finance this?

986
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,300
Okay, I'll bite.

988

I'm not at 100 percent bonds sold yet,
but I am close.

989
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,181
Hmm.

990
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:00,523
There. I just made up the d fference.

991
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:04,819
I would never ask anyone to take a risk
I wasn't will ng to take.

992
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,553
You're a good man, Hank Rearden.

993
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,892
Can I show you something?

994
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:13,833
GWEN:
Mr. Rearden's office.

995
01:01:14,738 --> 01:01:17,798
No, he's in a meeting.
May I give you his vo cemail?

996
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,063
Thank you.

997
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,043
DAGNY: Looks ike an engine.
HENRY: Not like any engine I've ever seen.

998
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:28,582
Where did you f nd this?

999
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:31,812
Remember that motor company
I was telling you about in Wisconsin?

1000
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,320
I did a ittle digging around
and I found these.

1001
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:36,584
DAGNY:
Twent eth Century Motor Corporation.

1002
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,921
It's a prototype for a new engine.

1003
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:42,394
It never went nto production.
I'm not even sure the th ng works.

1004
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:44,090
Well, it's worth a look.

1005
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,197
Once the John Galt line is comp ete,
I'd like to look into th s further.

1006
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,601
Care to help?
GWEN: Let me see what I can do.

1007
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:51,832
Abso utely.

1008
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:55,566
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Rearden.
There's an urgent call on line two.

1009
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,105
HENRY:
Hank Rearden.

1010
01:01:59,783 --> 01:02:01,444
What?

1011
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,119
Find Mouch.

1012
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:05,610
What is it?

1013
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,781
The leg slature passed
the Equa ization of Opportunity Bill.

1014
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:10,790
So quickly? How is that even poss ble?

1015
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:12,792
I don't know.
You know what this means?

1016
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,794
Nobody can own
more than one company.

1017
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:16,125
We'll f x this.

1018
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:19,632
I'll sign away my other companies,
but they are not getting my metal.

1019
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,269
What about Wyatt's bridge?

1020
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:25,932
I gave my word.

1021
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,135
It will be done on time and on budget.

1022
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:36,809
This is just a technicality. Hank.
Okay.

1023
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:39,649
I'll always consider the ore mine as yours.
No.

1024
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,621
I either own the property or I don't.

1025
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,924
You can trust me.

1026
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,888
You know you'll always have
as much ore as you need.

1027
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,088
I don't know.

1028
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,258
I've never g ven you any reason
to mistrust me.

1029
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:53,897
The mine is yours.

1030
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,231
If you intend to keep your word,
then keep t.

1031
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:59,637
If you wanna give me f rst call
on the ore produced, f ne.

1032
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,107
If you intend to double-cross me...

1033
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,473
...so be it.

1034
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,178
It's not fair, Hank.

1035
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:10,979
It wasn't me who passed the aw.

1036
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,703
DAGNY:
That s correct.

1037
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,508
The first train on the John Galt Line
will run July 22nd.

1038
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,243
MAN: Great news. Thank you, Dagny.
My pleasure, thank you.

1039
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:20,378
Dagny, this is, uh, Mr. Brady, a delegate
from the Union of Locomotive Eng neers.

1040
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:21,888
You're busy. I'I be brief.

1041
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,526
We're not gonna allow you
to run that train.

1042
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,093
Get out of here.

1043
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,857
You do not come and tell me
what you wi I or will not allow me to do.

1044
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,092
What I meant to say
was a committee decided...

1045
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,760
...that allow ng men to run your train
on that untested metal...

1046
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:37,930
...would violate their human rights.

1047
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,666
Are you serious, Mr. Brady?

1048
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:42,437
You can't force men to go out
and get killed for profit.

1049
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:43,909
Put that in writing.

1050
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:48,380
That you want to stop your men
from working and earning a wage.

1051
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,280
Miss Taggart, you don't understand...

1052
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:52,717
DAGNY:
Oh, no, no, no. I understand perfectly.

1053
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,084
You want me to provide the jobs...

1054
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:58,887
...and you wanna make it mpossib e
for me to have any jobs to provide.

1055
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,223
You can do whatever you want
with your men.

1056
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,798
But that tra n will run
if I have to drive myself.

1057
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:06,299
Because, Mr. Brady,
if that bridge collapses...

1058
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,733
...there won't be any railroad eft
in existence.

1059
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,463
But if it does not co lapse...

1060
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,302
...no member of your union
will ever get a job...

1061
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:14,966
...on the John Ga t Line.

1062
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:17,636
Now are you going to forb d your men
to run that train?

1063
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,975
I neveer used the word forb d.

1064
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,417
I'm on y stating that you cannot force
anyone to take that run.

1065
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,420
I would never force a man
to do anything.

1066
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,491
I'll ask for volunteers.

1067
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,423
Then it will be my problem, not yours.

1068
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,062
I'll advise them to refuse.

1069
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,562

1070
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,930

urges? T's not being charitable or fair.

1170
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:46,165
What s it with people today?

1171
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,803
HENRY:
So after a short while, no surprise...

1172
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,965
...the smartest managers
and the better workers left the company.

1173
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:57,135
But hundreds of remaining staff
couldn't handle it alone.

1174
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:03,510
Service dropped...

1175
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:06,985
...quality in their once-great products
was gone, and that was that.

1176
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:10,489
The Twentieth Century Motor Company
went under.

1177
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,684
That's depressing.

1178
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:23,096
Looks ike they just wa ked away.

1179
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,103
Not much heere.

1180
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,814
It's too bad.

1181
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:36,615
I'd really ike to figure out
what happened here.

Dagny.

1183
01:18:04,747 --> 01:18:07,545
This is it.
This is where they made the engine.

1184
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,248
Do you th nk it's here?

1185
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,686
Why would they leave all this stuff here?

1186
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:18,850
Some of this is incred bly sophisticated.

1187
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,996
It's unbel evab e.

1188
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:39,370
Hank?

1189
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:47,953
Atmospherc vacuum.
What?

1190
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:50,956
This motor uses the Casimir effect.

1191
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,395
It's this small particle accelerator.

1192
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,293
It throws sma helium particles
into heavier particles.

1193
01:18:57,466 --> 01:19:01,630
And this must be
a secondary cooling system.

1194
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:05,137
Probab y designed to el minate excess heat
generated during the process.

1195
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:10,472
Exact y, and this creates a magnetic fie d
in place long enough...

1196
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:13,274
...for the collapsing vacuum pressure
to be captured.

1197
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:17,442
An engine that uses atmospheric vacuum
to create stat c electricity.

1198
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:21,113
Now, does it say anywhere
on this document who designed this thing?

1199
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,587
I don't see any names.

1200
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,318
We could get a list
of the bu ding employees.

1201
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,155
We'd go to the town hall of records.

1202
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:30,457
Find the ast owner of the factory.
We'd track it back from there.

1203
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,062
Dagny, this could change the world.

1204
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:43,271
That factory has had a ong line of owners
and the records are not complete.

I'm sorry.
Thank you.

1206
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,772
Okay.
So I guess this s our start ng point.

1207
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,009
I bought it n a bankruptcy sale.

1208
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:53,279
From a guy named Eugene Lawson.

1209
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,185
Do you got any idea
how we might contact Mr. Lawson?

1210
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,258
He's in Washington now.

1211
01:19:58,427 --> 01:20:02,864
At the Bureau of Economic Planning
and Nationa Resources, I think.

1212
01:20:03,032 --> 01:20:07,469

1213
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,036

1215
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:16,109
Well, Mr. Rearden, you must be
awfully proud of your man Mouch.

1216
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:19,645
He's doing big things in Colorado
to help the nat on.

1217
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,376
I no onger have interest in Mr. Mouch.

1218
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,286
Oh.

1219
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,046
I see.

1220
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:31,181
Well, that's, uh... That's too bad.

1221
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:37,127

1222
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:40,126
Excuse me?
Jed Starnes.

1223
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:43,169

1225

My father was an evil man.

1226
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:50,875
But surely, he must have mentioned
something about work?

1227
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:53,037
A motor perhaps?

1228
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,410
The chief engineer was W iam Hastings.

1229
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:58,844
He quit the day
after we introduced the plan.

1230
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,182
You'll find him in Brandon, Wyoming.

five years ago, Miss Taggart.

1232

Did he eveer mention a motor he created?

1233
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,597
It was h s young assistant.

1234
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:14,224
William always said
he was, oh. Ahead of his time.

1235
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,701
Called him a genius.

1236
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,836
Do you know where we might be able
to find that man today?

1237
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:22,499
Oh, I have no idea.

1238
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:27,945
He did keep in touch with a professor
that he had at the Patrick Henry Univers ty.

1239
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:30,711
Hugh Akston was his name.
I know that name.

1240

Do you know where he is?

1241
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:39,049
Well, Mr. Akston was rumored to have
opened a roads de diner near Cheyenne.

1242

I gotta get back to my mills.

1243

I'll meet you in Colorado.

Hey, Eddie, what's up?

1251
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:14,125
The Union of Locomot ve Engineers
is demanding...

1252
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:18,665
...that all trains on the John Galt Line
be reduced from 100 to 60 miles an hour.

1253
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:20,665
If we don't comply, as of right now...

1254
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:25,273
...Wyom ng, New Mex co, Arizona and Utah
are not allowing any trains into Colorado.

1255

They're your frends. You stop them.

1263
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:55,529
Dr. Akston, I was wondering
if you remember a young engineer...

1264
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:59,697
...who worked at the Twent eth Century
Motor Corporation about 10 years ago.

1265
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:02,810
He worked w th a man
named W I iam Hastings.

1266
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,840
Could you tell me where to find him?

1267
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,212
Does this car get good m eage?

1268
01:23:09,885 --> 01:23:12,183
Is he still alive?

1269
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,552
Is there anything that you can tell me?

1270
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:19,152

Excuse me. I have to be heading home.

1274
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,707

1275
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:36,140
I need the name of your student
who worked at Twentieth Century Motor...

1276
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,872
I know why you're here, Miss Taggart.
Do you?

1277
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,516
The secret you're try ng to solve,
it's greater...

1278
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:48,589
...and I mean much greater than an engine
that runs on atmospheric electricity.

1279
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:55,253
Good luck.

MAN:
Move it.

1333
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:24,238
Lady, stop. You can't go in there.

1334
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:29,036
Ellis.

1335
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:34,748

01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,667
It's a place where heroes live.

01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:02,002
And where those who want
to be heroes llve.

1344
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:03,667
The government we have there...

1345
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:06,336
...respects each of us as indivlduals
and as producers.

1346
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:10,007
Actually, beyond a few courthouses,
there's not much of a government at all.

1347
01:28:10,185 --> 01:28:11,447
Bottom llne, Mr. Wyatt...

...lf you're weary of a government
that refuses to limlt power over you...

1349
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,149
...and If you're ready to clalm
the moral right to your own life...

1350
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,418
...then we should leave.

1351
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:22,995
