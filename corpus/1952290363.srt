1
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,312
The Keeper.

2
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:24,475
For the record.

3
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:26,535
You say no warrant to have?

4
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,539
I said I have not
have decided.

5
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:37,926
How is it done?

6
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,608
The informant is in their.

7
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:43,640
Do not worry
she will introduce us.

8
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,342
They'll all be.

9
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:02,234
Obviously not what you do.

10
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,451
You can pot.

11
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:07,470
Well we talk as friends?

12
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,644
That sounds normal. What?

13
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,963
You call that normal?

14
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,331
Hands up and go against
the wall.

15
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,243
Against the fucking wall.

16
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:45,765
Everything is safe.

17
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,350
Do you see?

18
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:53,460
That must have been a few million.

19
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:57,952
Wait Roland.

20
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:59,957
K361. Shots fired.

21
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:02,342
It is 4. The code is 4.

22
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,667
I bring our thoughts together.

23
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:06,153
We need support.

24
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,572
This is 2 million.

25
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:09,621
Nobody is claiming this.

26
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:11,453
You're joking, right?

27
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,755
The informant must have slipped away.

28
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,234
She tells it to anyone yet.

29
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:17,346
Only we are here and
these streamers.

30
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:20,054
I still thought I could?

31
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,957
Quiet, Roland.
I fucking something up.

32
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,406
I thought, man.

33
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:41,559
Roland Jesus, it had
could have been much easier.

34
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:44,783
We had the money to deal
without anyone surrounded.

35
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,864
Well, do your knees, huh? Everyone
may fall to a heart attack.

36
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,185
I retire and
I move to Utah.

37
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:13,933
But not you, Ro.
You have just become a hero.

38
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:25,174
I come back for you later.

39
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,363
This is D63H, there is an agent injured I
have an ambulance immediately.

40
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,770
D63H, what location?

41
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:42,660
Normandy 107 South-West corner.

42
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,741
Understood!
The ambulance is on its way.

43
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:48,873
Jesus I think my partner dies.
What time the ambulance arrives?

44
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:50,545
I need him here now.

45
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:56,412
It is the day I do, huh?

46
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,674
Sure that you not
the hospital wants. Yeah I'm okay.

47
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:04,374
It is time to arrest them.

48
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,410
I can not believe he is dead.

49
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:09,436
What dick you?

50
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:12,158
He had a pulse, Trevor.
They bring him to the hospital.

51
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,196
What?

52
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:18,377
The doctors say that 't look bad
sees, but he is still alive.

53
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:20,715
I saw him breathe his last
breather

54
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,225
He died.

55
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:25,369
Miracles. Let
We pray that this is one.

56
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:29,423
I leave you bring to the office
and there you put a statement.

57
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,319
Then take a
few days Fri

58
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,091
What have we here?
Gunshot wound to the chest.

59
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:52,663
All is ready. The team has come.

60
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,848
Here we come.

61
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:01,385
His pupils do not respond,
sir.

62
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:02,553
Give him 10cc.

63
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:06,609
Put on 75. Vrijf the discs. Free.

64
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:15,133
10CC and we begin.
I need a pen here?

65
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:09,560
Oh, Jesus.

66
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:13,399
It is difficult for him
like that.

67
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,150
He stable for now.
There is brain activity.

68
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,401
But unfortunately we can not say:
when he comes out of the coma.

69
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,523
Is he your uncle?
We worked together.

70
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,991
Give me his status? We can
not with certainty.

71
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:34,420
We know if he was not within 48 hours
added. Then we ...

72
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,492
testing on him brain damage.

73
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,379
Let me know if something changes?
On the desk is my number.

74
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,945
Roland, I must admit.

75
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:22,386
You're a tough rascal.

76
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:28,662
Shit.

77
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:30,497
That is bad luck.

78
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:36,006
You're lucky if you
have come far.

79
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:38,174
Damn ...

80
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,440
you were still
so faithful.

81
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,177
I get you now forever, Roland.

82
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:59,426
Who wants to really live nou
as a kind of vegetable?

83
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:05,790
Get the clothes.

84
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,801
Asshole.

85
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:12,259
You always have the last word.

86
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,404
Hey, pick up. It is Regina.

87
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,826
I listen because I have to come later
to the therapist this afternoon.

88
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:40,426
What is that good.

89
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:42,967
We can
arrange another time.

90
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,426
I can only one thing at a time, huh?

91
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:06,530
I do not know why I
refurbishment this stuff again?

92
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,432
Roland your injuries
killed the most people.

93
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:13,731
The fact is that you can still walk
is in itself a miracle.

94
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:16,783
When it is time
we throw them away.

95
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:17,996
If it is fast.

96
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:21,556
You have your incredible things
do it.

97
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,434
You are an inspiration to everyone
S.W.A.T that the team wants to hear.

98
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,604
Well, you know what?

99
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,739
I just want
the exercises.

100
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,434
They do.

101
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,374
Are you ready for a walk?

102
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:44,937
The fresh air will do me good.

103
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,637
I like to hear that.

104
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,069
I am proud of you, Roland.

105
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,339
Like many others.

106
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:01,777
Texas is not one
bit far away?

107
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,301
Not really, it's a great
State, Ms.

108
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:05,842
I have trained some.

109
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,507
I have good friends.

110
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:12,877
What the Chief is his name?

111
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,421
Conner. Standard guest. Good friend.

112
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,257
How are you?

113
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:36,033
It goes well with me.
it is nice to hear.

114
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:39,398
This is my dad, Conner Wells.

115
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,622
I stop with that shit man.

116
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:02,577
Is it so hard, Dad?
They seem fine.

117
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,578
Mason? Hello, dear.

118
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:49,058
Come here sweetie.
I find it exciting.

119
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,357
No, everything is good.

120
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:58,285
Well done, Mason. Sit down?
- Thank you, sir.

121
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:03,498
Cheers.

122
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:33,271
I would like champagne like here?

123
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:41,639
Mason?

124
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,603
Hello darling.

125
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:46,332
You're drunk.

126
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:47,704
Yeah, and?

127
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:49,694
What ...?

128
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:50,741
Where are they ...

129
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,494
It is time to go.
We are only

130
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:54,892
What about you?

131
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:56,095
We have only slightly
to celebrate.

132
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:58,294
Why four you
not with me?

133
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:00,970
Why are you angry?

134
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:02,917
I'm sorry sweetie.

135
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,959
Come with me?

136
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,673
Come we get the car and go.

137
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,635
It is too busy with
this lift to go.

138
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,922
Watch the step.
But first I'll go after you.

139
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,333
Here comes the Durak.

140
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:56,164
Let your ass
of here.

141
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,054
Stay away from the car.

142
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,170
Honey? Oh, shit.

143
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,066
Let me here.
- No ...

144
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,687
have you not had enough?

145
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:27,491
Of course not.

146
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:34,552
Go your way guys.
You want a shot?

147
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,009
Okay, I want to go.

148
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,513
Go to the car.

149
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,548
Mason, go back in the car
it is too dangerous.

150
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,612
Neeeeee.

151
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,492
Mason?

152
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:14,251
Get out of here. Shut up.
- Neeeee.

153
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:18,765
Go, go, go.

154
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:24,902
Mason, Mason? No!

155
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:26,927
Stop the car?

156
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,278
Stop ...

157
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,122
I am not available
leave a message.

158
00:20:57,199 --> 00:21:00,301
Police Pensions Medical Missions

159
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:04,540
You know that they study
have run against, Trevor?

160
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,339
I thought so on
would be?

161
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,741
That you the next morning
could begin again.

162
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:15,543
That's what you get from:
20 years loyal service.

163
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,090
Are you:

164
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:19,304
A good deed does not remain unpunished?

165
00:21:19,314 --> 00:21:21,314
This is special for me thanks.

166
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,544
The medical board wants to improve your recovery.

167
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:26,038
They want to retire.

168
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,771
You know what I'm going to do?
- Oh, boys.

169
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:33,780
Hello?

170
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:35,063
Role ...

171
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,173
I am so glad to hear your voice.

172
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:39,046
You know you're talking to?

173
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:40,404
I know.

174
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,881
How does the city enjoyed?

175
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,871
Not bad for an old man.

176
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,549
They treat you well?

177
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:48,900
Not bad I'm out in the corps.

178
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,541
and I'm under surveillance,

179
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,550
everything else is good, I.

180
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,800
Thank the Lord for this.

181
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,549
I have a problem, Roland.

182
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,250
And I think you're the only
you who can help me?

183
00:21:58,365 --> 00:21:59,706
What can I do for you, brother?

184
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:01,242
They have tried something
by Nikita

185
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,552
Is she okay?

186
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:03,652
She is in order.

187
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,451
Well ... But ...

188
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,343
I think it would look better to you
to talk in private.

189
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:11,852
If you want to get tomorrow
after you?

190
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,562
That is fantastic.

191
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,854
I will arrange everything.
My people will be informed.

192
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
See you tomorrow.

193
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:19,014
A plane is ready for you.

194
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:20,016
Is good brother.

195
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:00,588
Hello sir.

196
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:03,181
How are you, Sir?

197
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:05,373
I'm Detective Simon. It

198
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:06,973
Welcome to the city. Thank you

199
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:09,054
We still have a point ...

200
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:12,598
all baggage check
private flights and ...

201
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,776
that is the drug problem
in this continent.

202
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,576
Your name came up.

203
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,135
I understood that you
ex cop.

204
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:22,248
The fact is that your Security Training
've had ...

205
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:24,557
here at the police force 10 years
ago.

206
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:26,278
The good old days.

207
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:29,468
I understood that you are
retired.

208
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:32,909
I see that you also firearms
have taken.

209
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:35,578
I was a cop for 25 years in L.A,

210
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,021
I'll be a friend.

211
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:40,380
A simple thing. I understand.

212
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,182
I have no support
called.

213
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:44,466
Joker.

214
00:24:44,802 --> 00:24:46,582
You know how we are agents.

215
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,597
We never go anywhere
without weapons.

216
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,900
Yes I see the matter.

217
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:54,582
I hope that no
problem is ...

218
00:24:54,614 --> 00:24:57,299
if you remember why
you're here.

219
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,583
I love watching you.
Yes, sir.

220
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,485
I always nice to find someone
behind my back.

221
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:06,531
That we have ever seen.

222
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:09,237
Have a good day. Thank you Sir.

223
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:19,095

224
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:22,897
Everything good?
I Chauffeur for Mr. Wells.

225
00:25:23,378 --> 00:25:24,820
Nice to meet you.

226
00:25:31,187 --> 00:25:32,701
Mr. Wells offers his apologies ..

227
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,190
that he was not available ...

228
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:35,892
to get to personally.

229
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:38,992
He left his complex to
waiting for you.

230
00:26:03,698 --> 00:26:06,235
If you have children, future wife,
ex-wife, ...

231
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,125
children you know of anything?

232
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,389
Yes who has a nou
radio to ...

233
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,199

Do you like it?

235
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:21,499
It's a Mexican National Anthem.

236
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:22,502
Very popular.

237
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:23,981
Great.

238
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:00,963
Hello darling miss us?

239
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,115
Why you do that?

240
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,054
I love girls who swallow.

241
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:08,607
But that does not spit.

242
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,979
Teach your boyfriend swallow.

243
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:17,617
Why not tell you where
your brother is his army?

244
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:23,125
Hey, is that my cousin?

245
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:26,923
I do not know where they are?
- You do not?

246
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:29,884
I accept you do not NO,
okay?

247
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:32,916
That's my cousin.

248
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,098
Elena?

249
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,167
No.

250
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,381
You do not protect
baby, okay?

251
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:41,813
I kill you ...

252
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:43,595
Hey, that's my cousin, man.

253
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:45,613
Stop, leave him alone?

254
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,709
Got a problem?
They owe me money.

255
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:50,616
What is your problem?

256
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,615
Here you have it, asshole.

257
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,817
Bastards, I cut you open.

258
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,659
Rule one ...

259
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,617
If someone pulls a knife to me,
kill him.

260
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,843
I also have a rule.

261
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,177
I do not kill children.

262
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:07,218
What should I follow?

263
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,763
No children murder.

264
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,178
Jo ... come?

265
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:16,347
You will die, bitches.

266
00:28:17,218 --> 00:28:19,318
You really want to murder me,
either?

267
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:22,620
You die.

268
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,623
Listen to me?

269
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,105
I told you already ..

270
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:31,022
I do not like children to
to murder.

271
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,622
Try me out.

272
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:35,602
Let's go.

273
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,925
You do not know who
you arguing?

274
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:43,013
This is not over, punk.

275
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:44,016
Huh?

276
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:46,117
You forget your knife, friend.

277
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:52,627
Thank you sir.

278
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,694
Henrica, wait?

279
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,238
Pay attention to your sister.

280
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:05,043
I had problems with
employees of Mr. Cross.

281
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,551
Everything okay with you?
- Yes.

282
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,468
That great man helped me.

283
00:29:59,104 --> 00:30:01,040
His office is right here.

284
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:06,927
Good Afternoon my friend.
- Hello.

285
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,640
How about that.

286
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:11,812
Roland, it's too long ago.

287
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,908
Please, are you okay?

288
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:18,942
My apologies for the security.
What security?

289
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:20,643
Let's talk.

290
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:22,604
This way.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:26,424
Sit Roland.

292
00:30:26,637 --> 00:30:27,644
Thank you

293
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:30,002
Make yourself comfortable.

294
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,244
It is good to see you, partner.

295
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,281
Likewise.

296
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:35,346
See that thing there?

297
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:36,646
You still running
in that piece of junk?

298
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:37,696
- Yes.

299
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:38,947
Why is that?

300
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:41,046
I brought him back
is long past time.

301
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:43,964
Well, I know how that feels.

302
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,647
Let me tell you, Roland.

303
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,647
A year in Texas ...

304
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:48,849
and you look at Texas.

305
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,248
That is very nice, thanks.

306
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,692
I'm glad you do
like.

307
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:56,190
My father came from Texas, I can
This remind me a bit.

308
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,949
Tell me:
what's going on?

309
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,430
Someone has tried,
Nikita to abduct.

310
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:02,651
Have you any idea who?

311
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:05,767
Not really.

312
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:07,651
Any idea why?

313
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,753
There is a change in our
Family Tree.

314
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:12,352
My father is already deceased.

315
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,112
His oil and land threatening me
lose.

316
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:17,852
Why do not you call the police?
- I mean ...

317
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:19,914
In this part of Texas ...

318
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:21,655
will be on your estimated value.

319
00:31:21,658 --> 00:31:24,036
A man here has everything
under control, I am sure.

320
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:26,250
Ok. What do you want me to do?

321
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:27,456
I want ...

322
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,656
you personally for Nikita
care.

323
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:37,586
I am not a babysitter but ...

324
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:39,948
I want her bodyguard are you?

325
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:41,756
Do you buddy?

326
00:31:41,827 --> 00:31:45,129
I feel you
something told me ...

327
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:46,659
which is very important.

328
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,331
Someone in my organization
perhaps an enemy?

329
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:54,660
That changes the dynamic case

330
00:31:55,075 --> 00:32:00,379
Roland, you're the only one who
I can trust.

331
00:32:00,382 --> 00:32:02,642
Okay, what can I do?

332
00:32:02,985 --> 00:32:04,186
Nikita, is out.

333
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,662
She is constantly locked
in here ...

334
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,363
and I can not
forever shut.

335
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:09,457
Listen?

336
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:11,460
You need security cameras
not work.

337
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:14,464
You have no direct security
for your windows.

338
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:16,557
I do not know much about your staff.

339
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,655
If you want me security
Enter line, ...

340
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:20,864
then you listen to ...

341
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:22,278
what I say.

342
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,500
Deal?

343
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:26,210
I will protect you for Nikita.

344
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:28,234
I make sure that
nothing happens.

345
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,264
Thank you.
I knew I could count on you.

346
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:32,390
Of course sir.
We will settle you.

347
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,480
Can you take me for?

348
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:52,997
Honey there is someone here for you.
- Who is that?

349
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:55,913
You remember, Roland yet?

350
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:58,993
Damn.

351
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:02,263
How are you?
Fine, it could not be better with me.

352
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:07,532
We find a place where he can stay,
Indeed, we are practically family.

353
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:10,975
He is an expert in several things.
- What do you think?

354
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:14,999
If I say yes then that means,
I left that house is?

355
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,895
Yes Ms that you can

356
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:23,096
Want a coffee for me?

357
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:26,159
Course, comes immediately.
- Do you want a massage?

358
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:30,678
Nikita, he is not your slave, treatment
him the respect he deserved.

359
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:36,079
I respect him, Dad.
It is just that Voorhees ...

360
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,361
did everything I asked.
- I understand.

361
00:33:38,864 --> 00:33:41,065
Voorhees was a bodyguard who
we are lost in an ambush.

362
00:33:41,568 --> 00:33:43,681
I get it. We were
always very close with him.

363
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:45,180
Mason.

364
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:46,583
Hello darling.

365
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:49,680
Our Dad has a new
beveiliger hired. Oh yeah?

366
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,914
Roland met Mason.

367
00:33:51,014 --> 00:33:53,225
He found his answer in boxing

368
00:33:53,227 --> 00:33:56,433
and correspondingly what he deserved
He paid off.

369
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:59,453
You know what this means?
What? I can step back.

370
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,652
Really? Yes. Come
I want to show you something.

371
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:05,024
It was nice to see you.

372
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:08,286
It is a lot of work.

373
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:12,085
Well, if I do go.
Is there much change.

374
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:13,179
Of course.

375
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:17,182
You have complex, Tommy
- And Victor is very loyal.

376
00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:19,596
They do everything you ask,
You're the boss.

377
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:21,756
Can we start?

378
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:26,747
Hey, listen to. You should really
not drive this car.

379
00:34:40,174 --> 00:34:42,161
The inventory has arrived.

380
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:44,652
Is it readable?

381
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:47,287
Looks good.

382
00:34:47,945 --> 00:34:48,955
Good.

383
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:50,848
Keep it up.
- Yes.

384
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:45,703
Hey, Nikita, I have something for you.

385
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:49,002
Yes you see it here?

386
00:35:49,836 --> 00:35:51,904
I Sat chains.

387
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:54,403
But not this one.
You know why?

388
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,554
It is a detection device.

389
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:58,705
It is rather ugly.
- Turn around?

390
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,209
You know what that means?

391
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,306
Wherever you go
I can find.

392
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:06,482
That tickles.

393
00:36:10,923 --> 00:36:12,008
What is it?

394
00:36:12,094 --> 00:36:15,108
You do not fall on women?
Yes, I love women.

395
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:16,223
What?

396
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:19,267
Come on, we are waiting.

397
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,098
Coming.
You're the boss his daughter.

398
00:36:22,301 --> 00:36:24,403
Come on put them urgently.

399
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,433
You look good.
Will he last?

400
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,511
Yes, he is coming.

401
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:08,509
Who is there?
Do you know him?

402
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:09,672
Jason Cross.

403
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:11,720
He is a very powerful man.

404
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:12,809
Very dangerous.

405
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:13,921
Very dangerous.

406
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:16,719
Should I be scared?

407
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:20,178
You might not?

408
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:35,280
Makes it fun. I shall return.
- Be careful with him.

409
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,476
Ok. Let me try!

410
00:37:55,302 --> 00:38:00,154
By that bastard over there and
you get in big trouble.

411
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:20,208
Mason?

412
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,584
I need you to talk.

413
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,325
Right now? Yes, right now.

414
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:34,734
I've never
just ask ...

415
00:38:34,808 --> 00:38:36,583
not to do what you want.

416
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:40,237
I want you to consider
for me.

417
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:43,204
Think of your boxing career.

418
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,236
That is fun for us all.

419
00:38:46,253 --> 00:38:49,139
If you understand where I
talking about?

420
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:57,235
Want to rumble with the chip?

421
00:38:57,394 --> 00:38:58,738
Take it easy.

422
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:02,507
I do not want to pe
any problems.

423
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:09,040
I joined the Boy Scouts expelled
for eating cookies.

424
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:10,741
That sounds so stupid.

425
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:18,270
What you doing?

426
00:39:18,562 --> 00:39:19,872
Come on.

427
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:23,472
You look like
'Jip and Janneke.

428
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:25,430
You dare to say much.

429
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:29,789
I am not.

430
00:39:32,366 --> 00:39:33,597
Would you stay?

431
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:38,627
Where to go not the car
and give us the space.

432
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,669
Or drive to the chemist
or something?

433
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,260
I would not do
if I were you!

434
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:18,463
Hey, Nikita.
Where are you going, man?

435
00:40:18,702 --> 00:40:20,690
What you, man?
They were friends of mine.

436
00:40:21,158 --> 00:40:22,681
Stay away.

437
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:25,655
That is no excuse
for their behavior.

438
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:30,013
Where you going, huh?
Are you going with him now?

439
00:40:30,256 --> 00:40:31,782
What would you do?

440
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:34,755
That sounds great.
Have fun together.

441
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:36,425
See the man.
- We go.

442
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,056
Come on.

443
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,558
No, Daddy, Mason is out of control.

444
00:40:42,627 --> 00:40:45,838
I bale of the time I
I lost to him.

445
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:48,692
Nikita?
Papa, he is in love with Esfane.

446
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,199
He is no different than other
men his age.

447
00:40:51,608 --> 00:40:53,919
Men who quickly veelte
get everything ...

448
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:55,799
are always easy.

449
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:58,860
I wished him Roland
had given a beating.

450
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:00,864
- What?

451
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:04,639
Was that a smile?

452
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:11,938
- What?

453
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:26,235
Yes that's right.

454
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,418
Where is the former agent?

455
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:35,037
It is always Detective.

456
00:41:36,095 --> 00:41:38,147
Jup, where he is, Victor?

457
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,767
He is to meet the city medicine.

458
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:42,278
Do you want to talk about ...

459
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:43,504
the fight in the bar?

460
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:44,516
Fight.

461
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
People from L.A.

462
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,939
What can I say?

463
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:51,171
Ballistic Nylon.

464
00:41:52,082 --> 00:41:53,592
Popular stuff.

465
00:41:54,517 --> 00:41:55,719
Smart boy.

466
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,930
He knows a lot.

467
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,777
Look out for him ..

468
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,371
If it is a problem.

469
00:42:02,372 --> 00:42:04,593
You and your boss paid the price.

470
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:07,173
I'll let you know.

471
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:09,182
Yes do that.

472
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,013
I thought you forgot me?

473
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:33,294
I have some questions about
the kidnapping?

474
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,277
Mr. Wells has many enemies.

475
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,579
Most come from former
business agreements.

476
00:42:39,582 --> 00:42:41,177
Where else has he
you for?

477
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:43,480
We are just friends.

478
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,580
I feel that I am a little
can help ...

479
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:48,980
with security problems
and the like.

480
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:50,779
We have been both agent.

481
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:51,982
He is not an agent anymore.

482
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,782
I no longer.

483
00:42:54,577 --> 00:42:56,782
Your friend is associated
with rough people.

484
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:58,081
So if Cross?

485
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:00,782
Previously she acted together ...

486
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:03,884
When Conner's father
ran the business.

487
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:05,784
Can I ask you something?

488
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,255
What do you know about Cross?

489
00:43:08,265 --> 00:43:09,584
He is organized.

490
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:11,626
And I think he's a
species is racist?

491
00:43:11,628 --> 00:43:15,160
He believes that white and Mexicans
can not coexist.

492
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:16,170
That is crazy.

493
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:17,834
We were chasing him for years.

494
00:43:17,954 --> 00:43:21,187
And no one was there to man
something about him.

495
00:43:21,595 --> 00:43:22,786
- Listen!

496
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:25,087
You want your friend to help.

497
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:27,176
And I want Cross.

498
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,988
I do not know whether we met
help?

499
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,947
That's what I say.

500
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:35,758
Both agents bring together
their own man.

501
00:43:35,764 --> 00:43:37,765
Then we have a super deal.

502
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:39,231
Agreed.

503
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:52,568
Hey, Nikita!

504
00:43:52,956 --> 00:43:54,093
Roland is back.

505
00:43:55,628 --> 00:43:56,838
Is everything okay?

506
00:43:57,518 --> 00:43:58,692
Feel your own safe now?

507
00:43:58,708 --> 00:43:59,933
I do.

508
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:10,786
I like him, Dad.

509
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:12,897
Yeah I like him.

510
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:15,297
He gives me a secure feeling.

511
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:18,687
I guess I never updated as
someone I've felt so safe?

512
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:19,898
Except for you, Dad.

513
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:24,322
But something about him cross.

514
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,260
He is lonely.

515
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,534
But he will not
show it.

516
00:44:29,535 --> 00:44:33,799
I really think he is okay,
otherwise I trusted him.

517
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,083
I know.

518
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:40,801
I think I'm going step.

519
00:44:40,942 --> 00:44:41,942
Good.

520
00:44:43,576 --> 00:44:45,801
I'm glad you're yourself again.

521
00:44:46,402 --> 00:44:47,885
After all this misery.

522
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:49,190
I am proud of you.

523
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:50,200
Thank you

524
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:51,803
I'm looking behind me as you.

525
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:53,803
That is good.

526
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:08,679
Hello.

527
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:11,808
I'm hungry.

528
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:13,008
There is no food.

529
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,229
Do you want half of this?

530
00:45:14,317 --> 00:45:15,518
Okay then.

531
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:31,519
And Tory?

532
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,511
Well you know what it is?

533
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:37,728
People who are bodyguards know ...

534
00:45:37,732 --> 00:45:40,032
that they are at risk and
sometimes they pay ...

535
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,242
the ultimate price.

536
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:42,812
And I suggest that he did.

537
00:45:42,814 --> 00:45:46,235
The only good reason for
innocence, seems to die?

538
00:45:46,237 --> 00:45:47,813
You gave him ...

539
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:50,070
the maximum credit.

540
00:45:52,262 --> 00:45:57,315
You know Manuello and Jorga
half brothers?

541
00:45:57,339 --> 00:45:58,439
No.

542
00:45:58,608 --> 00:45:59,814
He told me once, ...

543
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:01,416
but that he kept hidden ...

544
00:46:01,445 --> 00:46:03,817
because he lives here, and ...

545
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,179
He is afraid to be recognized.

546
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:08,817
They have never told anyone ...

547
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,417
about private matters because ...

548
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:11,817
they did not trust.

549
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:13,189
I find that pretty cool.

550
00:46:13,493 --> 00:46:15,518
I mean people like it ...

551
00:46:15,593 --> 00:46:17,705
the way they are.

552
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:20,192
Every time I close my eyes ...

553
00:46:20,303 --> 00:46:22,021
I see those men in ...

554
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,120
the garage shoot him ..

555
00:46:25,614 --> 00:46:27,321
It is a terrible thing
for one ...

556
00:46:27,322 --> 00:46:28,820
young girl like you because
experience.

557
00:46:28,968 --> 00:46:30,600
It has great impact.

558
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:31,611
- Yes.

559
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:35,701
The paparazzi caused
that Mason ...

560
00:46:35,704 --> 00:46:37,022
The car did stop.

561
00:46:37,043 --> 00:46:40,043
Look, there is one thing.

562
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:41,431
I am now.

563
00:46:42,673 --> 00:46:44,685
Things will change.

564
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:47,029
It is just a nightmare.

565
00:46:48,132 --> 00:46:49,632
It is not over yet, either?

566
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:51,324
It is not over.

567
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:55,152
But I care about is the rapid,
I promise.

568
00:46:57,809 --> 00:46:58,927
Look, I ...

569
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,691
I'm sorry: that I own
behave so stupid sometimes.

570
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,427
I want you to know that I ...

571
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:07,630
really appreciate what you

572
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:08,686
is doing for me.

573
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:09,909
You are welcome.

574
00:47:12,352 --> 00:47:14,352
Very Cool what you did with
Mason his friends.

575
00:47:14,352 --> 00:47:16,395
There are so few
can fight.

576
00:47:16,397 --> 00:47:17,518
Just amazing.

577
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,622
I have just one religion.

578
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,831
You know what your doing.

579
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:26,832
I was lucky.

580
00:47:30,234 --> 00:47:31,776
Do you always eat that?

581
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:32,879
No.

582
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,832
That I wanted to say.

583
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:51,234
Are you sure you do not want to drink?

584
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:53,636
Among the work not drink young.

585
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,137
Why not?
You're bodyguard?

586
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:57,438
And I'm only driver.

587
00:47:57,485 --> 00:47:59,837
We do not drink while working.
- Understand?

588
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:02,136
I drink well water.

589
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:03,440
Yes, that's good.

590
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:19,541
Do they often?

591
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:20,880
Every Friday.

592
00:48:21,293 --> 00:48:22,524
Are you serious?

593
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:23,697
Loose Saturdays.

594
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:25,102
Sometimes on Tuesday.

595
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:28,723
That is not good buddy.

596
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:34,107
Are you okay?

597
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:36,514
Is she okay?

598
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:42,147
Mason remained in the club
with his friends ...

599
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,268
and now he takes his
mobile no.

600
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:47,471
You know what?

601
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:50,593
He will call you soon.

602
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:56,802
There is something you have given me ...

603
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:58,348
when I was a little girl.

604
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,840
You're still small.

605
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:02,566
What was it?

606
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:06,750
It was an umbrella,
I think that yes.

607
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:08,854
He was very very nice.

608
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:10,999
He was hand made and ...

609
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,641
completely painted.

610
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:16,171
I can not believe you
still remembered.

611
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,752
You said in the North
owning land

612
00:49:19,802 --> 00:49:22,822
You always told
fat stories.

613
00:49:23,265 --> 00:49:25,253
That was really cool.

614
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,054
You said that you a while
have lived in Asia.

615
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:29,453
After your service.

616
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,400
Am I right? Yes, ma'am.

617
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:34,082
The good old days.

618
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:39,051
That was ... Chang Sahaia.

619
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:43,746
I still have that umbrella
in my room.

620
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:46,857
He is as pretty as ever.

621
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:49,854
I have great difficulty
the issue.

622
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:53,486
Maybe you me
then one day bring?

623
00:49:54,273 --> 00:49:55,846
With all the love.

624
00:49:56,672 --> 00:50:00,693
I mean like 'm bodyguard.

625
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:01,840
Is my best.

626
00:50:02,971 --> 00:50:04,193
I find that funny.

627
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,861
Can I bring you home now?

628
00:50:06,864 --> 00:50:07,864
- Yes.

629
00:50:07,865 --> 00:50:08,865
Come on.

630
00:51:08,574 --> 00:51:10,540
Is look what you plan.

631
00:52:04,876 --> 00:52:06,198
How are you?

632
00:52:06,936 --> 00:52:08,383
You're late fighter.

633
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,320
What is it?

634
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:15,376
Why should I come?

635
00:52:15,691 --> 00:52:16,702
- Hey!

636
00:52:16,748 --> 00:52:17,885
We need to talk.

637
00:52:18,262 --> 00:52:19,972
Where is Mr. Cross?

638
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:21,319
I am.

639
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,887
Okay, I understand.
I tell you or.

640
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,242
Tell Mr. Cross:

641
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:26,887
I thank him for his offer.

642
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:28,036
But no thanks.

643
00:52:28,037 --> 00:52:29,038
- What?

644
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,140
Hear that?

645
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:33,407
He thinks he is cool.

646
00:52:38,078 --> 00:52:39,589
Keep your hands off me.

647
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,233
Have you ever seen this?

648
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:44,836
Note.

649
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,920
- No.

650
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:48,890
Are you psychopaths?

651
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:53,402
Keep your hands ...
- Quiet.

652
00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:56,892
Okay, man. Listen.

653
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,602
You want the girl, right?

654
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:00,858
Nikita.

655
00:53:02,927 --> 00:53:04,644
I know what is on his land.

656
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:07,190
It just interests me
as much as you.

657
00:53:07,247 --> 00:53:09,695
If you do this between us and the pause,
we do business.

658
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:10,884
You want the girl.

659
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,309
Then you get them.

660
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:17,068
We wait for your call.

661
00:53:18,627 --> 00:53:20,594
Have a nice day, huh.

662
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:25,319
You are on my list man.

663
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:28,207
Hey, I have time for.

664
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:32,826
We all Controlling
who comes here, so your well.

665
00:54:36,892 --> 00:54:37,893
Standard procedure.

666
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:40,256
Come, now get out here.

667
00:55:25,546 --> 00:55:28,920
Roland will be angry
we have gone away.

668
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,948
What do you care
what he thinks?

669
00:55:31,384 --> 00:55:33,516
Are your best friends now?

670
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,912
Why not?

671
00:55:36,322 --> 00:55:38,241
He is a good score.

672
00:55:40,092 --> 00:55:41,933
Jesus Christ

673
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,290
Where are we going?

674
00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:09,929
Calm down.
This is faster, baby.

675
00:56:12,564 --> 00:56:13,663
Mason?

676
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:24,310
Get out of the car, now?

677
00:56:24,362 --> 00:56:26,431
I said, come from that car?

678
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:27,691
Mason do something?

679
00:56:27,783 --> 00:56:28,983
Do what they say.

680
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:41,143
Roland?

681
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:45,513
Help me?

682
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:11,579
Sit firmly.

683
00:57:49,014 --> 00:57:51,746
These guards chasing me
get it behind me away?

684
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,204
I head towards the North,
at Florett

685
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:28,879
Go back. No.

686
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:56,668
Roland?

687
00:58:59,462 --> 00:59:00,662
Help me.

688
00:59:02,399 --> 00:59:03,609
Get on that bike.

689
00:59:13,681 --> 00:59:15,782
Keep your hands where I can see them.

690
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:17,427
Come on now.

691
00:59:17,586 --> 00:59:18,809
Get on your knees.

692
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,364
Those guys wanted to murder me.

693
00:59:20,413 --> 00:59:21,763
And they have a friend kidnapped.

694
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,999
Get on your knees. Yes, sir.

695
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,270
Give me coverage?

696
00:59:28,714 --> 00:59:30,034
He is now in custody.

697
00:59:30,045 --> 00:59:31,367
Report it here.

698
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:36,484
Roland, are you okay?

699
00:59:36,557 --> 00:59:37,757
There are many people here ...

700
00:59:37,768 --> 00:59:39,155
I think that you ...

701
00:59:39,157 --> 00:59:40,357
am interviewing ...

702
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,866
tied to a stable chair.

703
00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:43,866
I do this out of professional
Recital

704
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:45,037
and that's all I
can do.

705
00:59:45,151 --> 00:59:46,167
I appreciate that.

706
00:59:46,245 --> 00:59:48,269
I suggest that you contact
record with your lawyer.

707
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,370
This is perhaps, Texas ...

708
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:50,770
but not the Wild West

709
00:59:50,827 --> 00:59:52,169
You can not just people
shoot on the street,

710
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,247
and then get away.

711
00:59:53,249 --> 00:59:54,249
Look.

712
00:59:54,252 --> 00:59:56,270
Even a citizen who witnesses
of an abduction ...

713
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:57,570
can see what is possible

714
00:59:57,572 --> 00:59:58,591
what to do about it.

715
00:59:58,593 --> 00:59:59,700
That's what I did.

716
00:59:59,707 --> 01:00:01,720
That the court decides.

717
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,990
And let me tell you this:

718
01:00:03,087 --> 01:00:04,471
Their death ...

719
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:05,483
and not you.

720
01:00:05,486 --> 01:00:06,772
That is exactly what I say.

721
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,074
There is no case.

722
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:09,848
It was self defense.

723
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:19,905
John if you think:
he is wrong ...

724
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,953
he will avoid.

725
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,173
I give you my word.

726
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:23,499
Exactly.

727
01:00:23,565 --> 01:00:24,774
Thanks Johnny

728
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:26,775
We have time for.

729
01:00:26,776 --> 01:00:28,177
They work for Cross.
I know.

730
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,430
I've seen them together.

731
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:35,452
Tory Harris.

732
01:00:36,144 --> 01:00:38,678
He is a lieutenant of Cross?

733
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:40,024
- Yes, and?

734
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,461
Something intervened.

735
01:00:44,923 --> 01:00:46,178
I'll be back.

736
01:00:48,226 --> 01:00:49,979
Please, stay here?

737
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:03,569
Now what agent was.
He has three people slain.

738
01:01:19,326 --> 01:01:21,536
Excuse me.
You're free to go.

739
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:33,487
Sodeju.

740
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,989
I talked to him
as you requested.

741
01:01:49,062 --> 01:01:52,174
He was happy to see him today
in the church could meet.

742
01:01:59,376 --> 01:02:01,476
What do you exactly
to find my daughter?

743
01:02:01,912 --> 01:02:04,357
We could not find her, to
We know where she is taken.

744
01:02:04,448 --> 01:02:06,416
You said that no ransom
was required.

745
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:08,994
Three of the kidnappers dead ...

746
01:02:09,088 --> 01:02:10,288
were employees of
Jason Cross.

747
01:02:11,323 --> 01:02:12,995
Forgive me that I am not blind.

748
01:02:13,026 --> 01:02:16,235
We know of your past business
with Mr. Cross.

749
01:02:16,397 --> 01:02:17,596
For your daughter in hell.

750
01:02:17,597 --> 01:02:19,961
I urgently request you not
for us to hide.

751
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:23,380
Thank you.

752
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:26,898
You know what you should know
Nikita finds it.

753
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:28,297
There is another thing.

754
01:02:29,043 --> 01:02:34,166
Roland Sallinger was released this afternoon
to help and I am sure ...

755
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:35,999
of a phone call from you.

756
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,860
Do you really think it wise?

757
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,990
The Chief was disappointed ...

758
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:43,299
but he knows that my word,
my deposit is

759
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,724
You should leave him alone he
has nothing to do.

760
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:49,001
That is not what Mason Silver
says.

761
01:02:49,956 --> 01:02:51,301
He is not trustworthy.

762
01:02:51,546 --> 01:02:53,880
If you have no idea who
has done or why ...

763
01:02:53,886 --> 01:02:56,200
are you so sure that
he is innocent?

764
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:57,782
Because I trust him.

765
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,003
Now please go away.

766
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:02,607
It is late and other things ...

767
01:03:02,706 --> 01:03:04,003
also need attention.

768
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:06,054
If the kidnappers contact
with you ...

769
01:03:06,057 --> 01:03:07,709
I want to know immediately.

770
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:20,208
Hello?

771
01:03:20,828 --> 01:03:23,008
Are you now so far
to talk?

772
01:03:23,686 --> 01:03:25,674
Where is my daughter?

773
01:03:25,946 --> 01:03:27,156
Safe.

774
01:03:29,232 --> 01:03:30,332
Thank you.

775
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:34,839
But its still up to you?

776
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:40,011
Look, it takes more time they can
not getting found.

777
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:41,939
24 hours Conner.

778
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:44,854
And not a minute longer.

779
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:48,876
It does not take long before
it also gets the news.

780
01:03:50,138 --> 01:03:52,572
Intelligence equals power.

781
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,576
Conner.

782
01:03:53,646 --> 01:03:56,003
I do want from the uranium.

783
01:03:56,116 --> 01:03:59,116
And if you dear Nikita
To look back,

784
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:02,790
give you my land ...

785
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:05,032
and 5 million in diamonds.

786
01:04:05,858 --> 01:04:07,280
How can I be sure that
she still alive?

787
01:04:07,494 --> 01:04:09,015
Cross you hear me?

788
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:14,107
Let's go.

789
01:04:16,337 --> 01:04:20,589
Have you been able to contact them?
Yes sir, Manu is all there.

790
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,252
She says.

791
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,281
I do not know where he is?

792
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,040
Just keep sitting patiently.

793
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:08,379
I'll be back, okay?

794
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:18,591
Victor says he wants the items
and 5 million within 24 hours.

795
01:05:23,526 --> 01:05:27,410
Have you the address of Mason?
Yes, I have an address.

796
01:05:28,044 --> 01:05:30,587
I thought you do
could use?

797
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,031
Your religion is a
low ebb.

798
01:05:34,065 --> 01:05:35,832
I did not know where else
I had to give you.

799
01:05:35,867 --> 01:05:37,629
I'm nervous, okay?

800
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:44,941
Good evening.

801
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,781
How are you?

802
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:49,035
Well. It's better now.
And you?

803
01:05:49,038 --> 01:05:50,248
Very good.

804
01:05:51,117 --> 01:05:52,934
How many brothers do you?

805
01:05:54,898 --> 01:05:55,998
But two.

806
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:57,179
But two.

807
01:05:58,561 --> 01:05:59,885
That hurts.

808
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,937
They are in order and are ready
if you need them.

809
01:06:02,939 --> 01:06:03,939
Are you sure?

810
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:05,041
I'm sure.

811
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:09,158
Are you sure? I know
sure. I owe you.

812
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,706
Thanks for yesterday.

813
01:06:12,004 --> 01:06:13,104
No, thank you.

814
01:06:46,067 --> 01:06:47,145
Yes I keep it.

815
01:06:47,147 --> 01:06:48,175
Now do not you move?

816
01:06:48,188 --> 01:06:49,215
This is good shit.

817
01:06:49,228 --> 01:06:50,651
Keep it up.

818
01:06:53,391 --> 01:06:55,046
Can you see it?

819
01:06:55,158 --> 01:06:56,934
Man go by with cards,

820
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:40,505
I had no choice.

821
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:44,255
They said I had to testify.
- I said I would not do.

822
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:49,257
I put my pride aside.
- I screwed up.

823
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:51,058
Let me ask you a question.

824
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:53,972
Were you proud of your cross and then ...

825
01:07:53,998 --> 01:07:56,027
you have arranged her abduction?

826
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,657
Look man, they said:
she would murder me.

827
01:08:00,303 --> 01:08:01,569
I know you do not believe me.

828
01:08:01,572 --> 01:08:03,559
But I love Nikita, and I
would never inflict anything.

829
01:08:03,656 --> 01:08:05,058
She said she
would do nothing.

830
01:08:05,142 --> 01:08:07,939
It was him or me, you understand?

831
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:11,359
If you love her,
protect your hair, you understand that?

832
01:08:11,414 --> 01:08:12,647
Well where is she?

833
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:16,061
I do not know?

834
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:18,756
See these two dead here?

835
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:22,080
You are also like this
about 5 min

836
01:08:24,397 --> 01:08:27,605
We had agreed
in the restaurant ...

837
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:29,763
on the other side of town.

838
01:08:29,824 --> 01:08:32,034
Let me ask you something.

839
01:08:36,064 --> 01:08:38,164
Go down here.

840
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:42,765
What is wrong here?

841
01:08:42,803 --> 01:08:44,924
She sits on his lap.

842
01:08:45,462 --> 01:08:47,068
You know what's wrong?

843
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:54,068
Nikita, running all kinds
danger at this moment ...

844
01:08:54,147 --> 01:08:56,357
and you are home to the festivities.

845
01:08:57,159 --> 01:09:00,121
Now I leave you the same risk
run as it does.

846
01:09:00,174 --> 01:09:03,060
Understood? We go.

847
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:44,831
Yes, hello?

848
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:48,496
Your time is running out now.

849
01:09:48,497 --> 01:09:51,079
I'm working on it.
- Good.

850
01:09:51,568 --> 01:09:53,688
Are we on schedule?
- Yes.

851
01:09:55,037 --> 01:09:56,702
I want Nikita talk?

852
01:09:57,142 --> 01:09:59,129
She is not now available.

853
01:09:59,144 --> 01:10:01,686
Do not worry you'll see her soon.

854
01:10:02,447 --> 01:10:05,467
Where? Tomorrow 20:00.

855
01:10:05,484 --> 01:10:07,907
I want some real estate deal.

856
01:10:12,559 --> 01:10:13,570
Ma'am?

857
01:10:14,945 --> 01:10:16,955
Will you hold him now?

858
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:18,653
No, I do not.

859
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:21,084
Cross is not stupid.

860
01:10:22,105 --> 01:10:23,771
I make that mistake.

861
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:26,235
There is no police presence.

862
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:28,046
What will you do?

863
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:30,465
Just chase.

864
01:10:53,441 --> 01:10:55,541
Thank you very much. Good evening.

865
01:11:02,789 --> 01:11:05,552
Was it so hard to do
what we asked?

866
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:12,405
We have a problem.

867
01:11:16,469 --> 01:11:18,402
You go that way Manuello.

868
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,737
Roland I'm touched.

869
01:11:45,269 --> 01:11:47,257
Get out.

870
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:43,110
I think we need to talk?

871
01:12:43,552 --> 01:12:45,106
Roland, how do you get in?

872
01:12:45,634 --> 01:12:48,812
Well I have the restraint
regulated.

873
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:50,103
I know that.

874
01:12:51,932 --> 01:12:54,012
I invented that
Mason has screwed you.

875
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:56,241
But I think you already know?

876
01:12:56,531 --> 01:12:58,074
I had my suspicion.

877
01:12:58,328 --> 01:13:00,338
My daughter trusted him
information to,

878
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,114
which he used against us.

879
01:13:02,227 --> 01:13:06,315
What information would that be?
- Where is he looking for?

880
01:13:06,325 --> 01:13:08,334
5 million in diamonds.

881
01:13:08,393 --> 01:13:10,415
Manuello thought I told you that?

882
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:11,462
You know?

883
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,612
I think there is much more
going on?

884
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:17,518
5 million is not much when you
compares with a similar robbery.

885
01:13:17,718 --> 01:13:18,818
Tell me what's going on?

886
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,948
I understand what you meant?

887
01:13:21,055 --> 01:13:23,067
I feel that we do not
on one line.

888
01:13:23,173 --> 01:13:25,157
We are friends.

889
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:29,179
Sorry.

890
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,420
Cross and I grew up together.

891
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:35,121
He chose to become criminals
I and a policeman.

892
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,821
You know my family
much as owner.

893
01:13:39,021 --> 01:13:40,673
One is located in Oldfield.

894
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,896
He is not interested in the ground.

895
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:46,238
Are interested in where he is,
this.

896
01:13:46,446 --> 01:13:48,502
We were looking to
for oil ...

897
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:51,124
but we found something else
precious.

898
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:52,712
Uranium.

899
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,124
To cut a long story
short.

900
01:13:56,552 --> 01:13:58,823
I found the largest uranium field ...

901
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,375
history in North America.

902
01:14:00,713 --> 01:14:02,725
And that's you doing
dearly.

903
01:14:02,728 --> 01:14:03,728
Bit.

904
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:05,572
We have much work
to do.

905
01:14:06,257 --> 01:14:07,680
That sounds logical.

906
01:14:07,788 --> 01:14:09,231
I knew that something was.

907
01:14:09,519 --> 01:14:14,504
If I sign tomorrow is very
my life's work in one blow away.

908
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:16,127
I do not shit about him.

909
01:14:16,144 --> 01:14:17,766
I just want Nikita back.

910
01:14:17,859 --> 01:14:19,069
But I have no choice.

911
01:14:19,374 --> 01:14:20,578
You have a choice.

912
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,588
And you sign any papers.

913
01:14:22,606 --> 01:14:24,128
Where is the transmission.

914
01:14:24,387 --> 01:14:25,608
Above the hills.

915
01:14:25,713 --> 01:14:26,944
He is on the building.

916
01:14:27,377 --> 01:14:28,430
I'm known there.

917
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,040
I had plants.

918
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:32,066
You get your daughter back.

919
01:14:32,228 --> 01:14:33,431
You have nothing sure
about.

920
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:35,339
I give you my word.

921
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,406
He talks with me.

922

Yes, I think so.

924
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,342
You know how many men there are?

925
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:45,641
Enough to make it interesting.

926
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,827
Thank you, Tory.

927
01:16:13,706 --> 01:16:18,151

01:16:31,608 --> 01:16:33,619
I've taken a big risk
for Mr. Cross,

932
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,644
I want to know when I
get paid?

933
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:38,053

01:17:00,035 --> 01:17:02,156
He was dead before morning.

942
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,158
Well, let's go?

I hope you die.

946
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:12,183
With emotions get you nowhere.

947
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:18,205
