1
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:58,140
Hi, Bill.

2
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:01,397
I knocked. You know,
there's no answer or I thought,

3
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,585
you know,
you drowned or something.

4
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:08,782
Sorry, I... I didn't drown.
I'm just having a bath.

5
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:12,722
Charlie, it's time.
Your mom, she...

6
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,490
- They called?
- Yeah.

7
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:26,671
It's Sambuca.

8
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,684
Put this in your pocket.

9
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:53,531
We switched to a manual apparatus
which enables us to ease her out.

10
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,168
Out where?

11
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,741
Mr. Green, I honestly think you're
doing the right thing here.

12
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,325
Can I have one of those?

13
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:20,260
They're for my back.

14
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:23,397
Can we say for now that my back
hurts too, Bill?

15
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,901
Two's the ticket if it hurts as
much as mine does.

16
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:05,441
This is what happens. Are you
ready?

17
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:04,336
Took a powder, Charlie?

18
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:13,012
I'm sorry, it's just that, that
I feel horrible now.

19
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:16,115
I blame myself, Charlie. I was
never very good at it.

20
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,383
At what?

21
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:18,852
Being a mom.

22
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:23,623
No, mom. That's not true. You
were good, you were great.

23
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,160
Weren't you?

24
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:31,699
I was always so wrapped up in my
own crap.

25
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,602
Meeting Greg, and leaving your
dad.

26
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:39,206
And meeting Bill and leaving Greg.
I could never get the sequences right.

27
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,075
You're a complicated lady.

28
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:42,276
I didn't mean to be.

29
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,579
Were. I know, I know.

30
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:50,418
And I sure didn't mean for you to
be running out on death scenes.

31
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,557
And just floating through your
entire existence, Charlie.

32
00:06:57,326 --> 00:07:00,495
I'm the one who's sorry, kiddo.

33
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:05,501
What do I do now? I still got a
whole life to go now, you know?

34
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:07,603
Did we not just say that was
never my thing?

35
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:10,973
Please, mom. I need you to be
specific now.

36
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:14,043
Just this once. Tell me what to
do

37
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,748
I got it.

38
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,951
Go to Bucharest.

39
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,353
Bucharest?

40
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:25,656
Yeah. Go to Bucharest.

41
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,124
Why, mom?

42
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:30,260
I don't know, it seems specific.

43
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,262
Just do it, Charlie.

44
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:35,399
Say you promise.

45
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:42,206
I promise.

46
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,108
Good.

47
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,945
I have to go now, Charlie.

48
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:56,654
Mom, wait a second, I got this I have
this horrible visual in my head of you.

49
00:07:56,656 --> 00:08:01,026
I need something nicer,
something fun...

50
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:05,364
Oh, Charlie... oh, you goof.

51
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,333
Come here.

52
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:25,950
Better?

53
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,225
- God.
- Okay, good.

54
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,104
Charles?

55
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:17,874
It's okay. Just give us a
minute.

56
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,576
We're not together anymore.
Go home.

57
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:26,380
Oh, no. Ted.
Oh, my God. Ted.

58
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,753
Yeah, you're not funny. Go home.

59
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:33,791
Ya, Ashley, everything cool?

60
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,392
It's fine, just give us a
minute.

61
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:37,127
What are you gonna do, Chuck
Norris?

62
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:40,697
Go fuck yourself. Asshole.

63
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,599
I'm moving to Bucharest.

64
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:45,302
Yeah? Are you sure you're not
thinking of Budapest?

65
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:47,171
It's supposed to be really nice
there.

66
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:50,341
My mother just died so...

67
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:51,780
- You okay?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:02,787
Just take care of yourself,
Charles.

69
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,453
Sir.

70
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,841
What do you mean with touching
me?

71
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:56,978
I didn't. You fell asleep on my
shoulder, sir. Sorry.

72
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,846
What is wrong with your face?

73
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:00,314
What's that?

74
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,550
Your eyes. Here.

75
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:03,152
You look bad.

76
00:11:07,857 --> 00:11:10,759
My mother just died.

77
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:14,496
I'm sorry for you.

78
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:18,767
My wife died many years time
ago.

79
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:21,271
I never loved another woman
since.

80
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:22,972
Well, I'm sorry for you also.

81
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:28,778
I make sex with many of them,
sure, but never with love.

82
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,246
I am Victor Ibanescu.

83
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:31,948
Charlie Countryman.
Nice to meet...

84
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,732
- Romanian.
- American.

85
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:34,884
Charlie...

86
00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:35,952
Yeah?

87
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:38,556
Why are you going to Bucharest?
Tell me.

88
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:41,692
I don't really know to be honest
with you.

89
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:43,794
You didn't want to go to
Budapest?

90
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,403
No, I was just kinda...

91
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:50,449
...yeah, Bucharest. Just spur of the
moment kind of thing, you know?

92
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:53,904
I understand this kind of thing.

93
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,313
I see, you don't want to speak
with me.

94
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:02,581
No, I just

95
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,482
No trouble for me. No.

96
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:07,786
I didn't know if you wanted to keep
speaking or if you wanted your own time.

97
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:11,022
I speak with you first and you're
not sure I want to speak with you?

98
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,658
Strange way of a mind to be
working, no?

99
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,495
Yeah, I'm sorry. That's sort of
why I'm going on this trip.

100
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:18,064
Work things out in my mind.

101
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,566
Yes, yes. Bafta acolo, Charlie.

102
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:22,068
Good luck in there!

103
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,970
Thank you.

104
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:25,938
Bafta acolo.

105
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,007
If you don't mind me asking, how do you
wind up in Chicago when you're from Romania?

106
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:34,306
- Me?
- Yeah.

107
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,050
I want to see the Cubbies at
Wrigley's Field.

108
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:41,054
I want to sing Take Me Out To
The Ballgame one time before I die

109
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:44,784
And one, and two, and three strikes
and you are an out for the old ballgame.

110
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,065
Why the Cubs, though? I mean,
there's other better teams.

111
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,369
The Cubs are pretty, It's a
shitty team.

112
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:58,006
Yes! The Cubbies will never win
the Worlds Championship Series.

113
00:12:58,008 --> 00:13:02,377
Of course not. Never, never,
never. No.

114
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:06,781
But Romania, my country, there's
many problems in history, too.

115
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:11,787
Invasions, occupations,
dictators.

116
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:15,924
It is problems which make us who
were are...

117
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:17,826
which give us character.

118
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:19,695
Same as the Cubbies!

119
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,630
Yes. Yes!

120
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:24,133
You make a lot of sense, Victor.

121
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:26,576
- My pleasure.
- Yeah, my pleasure.

122
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:27,881
Yeah.

123
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:33,143
May I show you something very,
very, very incredible?

124
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,345
Yeah, of course!

125
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:44,654
For my daughter.

126
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,890
Oh my god.

127
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:50,061
You think she will love it?

128
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,163
Yeah, well, who wouldn't?

129
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,900
Yeah? Who wouldn't! This is what
I thought. Who wouldn't?

130
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:56,967
Hello?

131
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,071
Please, champagne, for my friend
and me.

132
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:04,042
And perhaps you'll bring another
glass for yourself too, my darling?

133
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,911
Look, it's nice this hat.

134
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,412
It's very nice.

135
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,848
Yeah, that's really nice.

136
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:32,405
Buddy?

137
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,809
Victor?

138
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,754
Victor, Victor, Victor?

139
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:47,988
Oh, fuck!

140
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,390
Oh, boy!

141
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,060
Can I help you, sir?

142
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,048
- Is there a doctor here?
- Why, you unwell?

143
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:58,131
You should just take his pulse, I don't
know what I'm supposed to do here.

144
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:08,476
What do we do?

145
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:10,812
What do we do with a dead man on
the plane?

146
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:13,214
Just be quiet. You're going to
alarm the others, okay?

147
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,817
He's a dead man so I need to
move seats now.

148
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:17,586
I'll be back in a second, okay?

149
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:18,921
Excuse me!

150
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:22,057
Excuse me! Excuse me!

151
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,260
No, I can't- I can't sit -

152
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:25,728
I'm terribly sorry, sir

153
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,596
but you have no choice but to
continue on to Bucharest.

154
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:31,934
You can't even move seats, I'm afraid,
because it's totally fully booked.

155
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:33,669
This is a dead man.

156
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:36,506
Look, why don't you just enjoy your
complimentary beverage, okay?

157
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:39,209
Listen. Listen, I can't sit
here! Put me in a jump seat!

158
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:41,144
Put me in the bathroom! In the
lavatory!

159
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:42,245
We will keep them coming.

160
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:44,181
Just put me in the lavatory. And
I need

161
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:46,116
I suggest you calm down, sir.

162
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:49,986
My hands! Listen! I need a wet
nap! Can you get me...

163
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,567
Charlie.

164
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:06,838
Charlie?

165
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,072
Yes?

166
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:09,540
Come into here.

167
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,675
Okay.

168
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:11,909
Charlie...

169
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:13,178
Yes?

170
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,213
I saw your mother.

171
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:15,714
Yes?

172
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:21,286
I told her you are going to
Bucharest. She smiles for you.

173
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:23,021
I'm sorry you're dead, Victor.

174
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:27,192
Oh, nevermind! I see also my
wife.

175
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,329
She made some love to me.

176
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:33,666
And Charlie, I ask you a special
thing.

177
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:34,968
Yes?

178
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,671
It is my daughter. Perhaps
you'll give her my gift?

179
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:39,906
Yes.

180
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:44,277
And please, tell her she is...

181
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,681
"fetita mea cu picioare de catel. "

182
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:51,285
Say again?

183
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,801
I don't speak... What'd you say?

184
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:41,404
He wants to know if the funny
hat is belonging to you.

185
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:44,875
Belonging to me? Yes. My funny
hat.

186
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,677
No, this is my hat, my friend!

187
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:47,811
What'd you say to him?

188
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:49,880
I told him it's not your funny
hat, man.

189
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,048
Why?

190
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,549
Because it's not your funny hat.

191
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:55,652
So, you're an asshole? How do
you say asshole in Romanian?

192
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:57,387
To an American, I see you're an
asshole.

193
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:00,023
Sir, this hat belonged to a
friend of mine. He was...

194
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,701
Okay.

195
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:12,870
Charlie Countryman.

196
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:16,441
That's you. Hi. I'm Radu.

197
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,909
Radu? Or Mr. Radu?

198
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:22,281
No, I'm the one who's asking the
questions today, my friend.

199
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:25,718
Victor Ibanescu. You knew this
guy?

200
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,854
I met him on the plane. You
know, very, very brief.

201
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:34,693
Can you tell me why does a guy want a guy he
doesn't know to take a hat to his daughter?

202
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:38,230
Why can't the guy take the hat
to his daughter by himself?

203
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:42,435
I'm sorry. It's a lot for me to
process because I just got tazed.

204
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:45,138
Is this something you guys
normally do?

205
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,440
Charlie, questions me. Answers
you.

206
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,875
Yes. Okay.

207
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,310
Nice and slow.

208
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:55,115
Do you think Victor Ibanescu
knew he was going to die?

209
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:59,387
Or perhaps, he said it to you
after he was dead.

210
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,255
Maybe you talk to the dead
people?

211
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:04,392
Like that boy in the Bruce
Willis film?

212
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,361
I talk to dead people.

213
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:10,064
I think he sees the dead people.

214
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,298
What?

215
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,200
You do drugs, Charlie?

216
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,737
No! No.

217
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,988
Hi. I'm Charlie Countryman.

218
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:10,829
Eu sint Gabriela Ibanescu.

219
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:16,801
Can you tell me what happened
with my father?

220
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:19,404
He fell asleep, and...

221
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:26,177
that was it, he just
didn't wake up.

222
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:27,650
On me, actually.
He was...

223
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:33,956
If you still look here,
his drool is right here.

224
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:38,958
Your father wanted me to tell
you something.

225
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,329
I don't understand how could he
know we would meet?

226
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:47,099
Well, he said something about
you to me.

227
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:48,969
If you want to hear it.

228
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:50,337
Please.

229
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,210
He said that you were his f-f
fatate

230
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,379
Fuck.

231
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,882
Fetita catel picante

232
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:04,384
fetita mea cu picioare de catel

233
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:06,104
Yes.

234
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:08,189
He said that? Really?

235
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,057
What does that mean?

236
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:14,428
She has feet of a childish dog
woman.

237
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,297
Puppy feet girl.

238
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:27,476
Would you allow me?

239
00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:31,313
Anything. Yes.

240
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:50,900
Thank you.

241
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,409
You could have this shirt if you
want to. You could just take it.

242
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:04,048
I mean, I have other shirts in
my bag.

243
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,921
Here.

244
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:18,562
Thank you, Charlie.

245
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:20,932
You're welcome, Gabi.

246
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,136
It's nice to meet you.

247
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:13,086
Robert Redford!

248
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:15,089
What's that?

249
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:20,662
Robert Redford!

250
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:25,033
Me Robert Redford? No, you
Robert Redford, man!

251
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:27,535
No, no, no, no. Hubble Gardner!

252
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:28,937
Yeah?

253
00:23:32,575 --> 00:23:35,110
I don't speak...

254
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,724
Pull over.

255
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,062
Stop the car! Stop...

256
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:56,366
Gabi!

257
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,502
Charlie! From the airport.

258
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,605
No, keep it. It was a gift.

259
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,507
You okay?

260
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,746
I meant to follow the ambulance,
but

261
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:12,783
it was driving like some kind of
idiot and I lost him.

262
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:17,355
Look, there's a bunch of traffic.
I bet we can still catch it if we go now?

263
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:18,589
We?

264
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:19,790
We, yes, yes.

265
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,793
Listen, I know you don't know
me, okay?

266
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,097
I have a feeling about this. And
I don't get a lot of feelings.

267
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:30,502
Not clear ones anyway so when I do get
a feeling like this one, I try to trust it.

268
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:37,042
I'm super nervous right now 'cause
this is a wild experience for me.

269
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,723
- Scoot over. - What?
- Scoot over.

270
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,618
Hubble!

271
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,487
Your cab.

272
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:50,156
Sorry, my friend. How much?

273
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,460
Three? Three. Yes?

274
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:56,029
Yes.

275
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:05,239
There's second out, third,
fourth. Yeah?

276
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:42,812
You play cello?

277
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:45,548
What gives you this idea?

278
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,883
There's a cello in your trunk.

279
00:25:47,885 --> 00:25:52,521
Maybe you have some kind of
fantasy about helping a sad

280
00:25:52,523 --> 00:25:57,660
woman inn a far away land
happens to play the cello?

281
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:04,868
I am making a joke.

282
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,336
You're making a joke?

283
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:07,671
You did not understand?

284
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:10,240
No, I just didn't hear 'cause a
tram just went by right

285
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:12,776
when you were saying probably
saying the punch line!

286
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:14,911
You have punch lines here, yes?

287
00:26:14,913 --> 00:26:20,718
The joke is to imply that you
are making this up in your mind.

288
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,120
Right.

289
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:27,191
'Cause I am pretty I'm
vulnerable, I play the cello.

290
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:29,494
It's a boy's dream, no?

291
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:34,198
Well, you're pretty enough. But
I'm more of a tuba guy myself.

292
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,840
I play the cello in the orchestra
of the Bucharest Opera House.

293
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:43,442
Really?

294
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:48,447
My father was my teacher.

295
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:27,318
For my darling Gabi.

296
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:32,957
Love, Nigel.

297
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,036
Oh, come on!

298
00:28:49,743 --> 00:28:51,744
Thank you!

299
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:00,486
Thank you!

300
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:26,747
Excuse me! North Golescu?

301
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:29,884
Excuse me. Opera house?

302
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:32,486
You don't know? That way?

303
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:45,867
Hey!

304
00:29:49,105 --> 00:29:50,672
Excuse me!

305
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:58,381
Excuse me!

306
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:05,021
Excuse me, friend!

307
00:30:05,023 --> 00:30:08,424
Hi, I'm looking
for Gabriela Iban...

308
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:20,371
Sorry. Sorry!

309
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:23,907
Sorry!

310
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,977
Hi, Gabi's phone.

311
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,480
Charlie, it is me, Gabi.

312
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:31,181
Gabi. Hi! How are you?

313
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:32,983
Where are you?

314
00:30:32,985 --> 00:30:36,988
I came to the Opera. I didn't know
where else to go, so I just came here.

315
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,125
I have your car and your cello
and everything.

316
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:45,130
I will come there soon. I want
you to wait for me, okay?

317
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:48,900
Okay. Really like a nice place
to work. Like, incredible.

318
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:50,769
Think I'm about to audition.

319
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:56,175
Do you see a man who looks like
his face is in pain?

320
00:30:56,177 --> 00:30:58,878
Face is in pain? Yes.

321
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,146
He yelled at me.

322
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:02,014
Can you give him the phone?

323
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:03,634
- Give him the phone?
- Please.

324
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,409
- Okay.
- Tempo! Tempo!

325
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,788
Just a second.

326
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,491
Hi. Hi. Gabi.

327
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:12,526
Gabi?

328
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:13,894
Gabi.

329
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:15,662
Sorry.

330
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:17,531
Hello?

331
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:19,666
Stop, stop, stop!

332
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:27,908
Wait at the door.

333
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,811
Which door?
Because there's those...

334
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:33,014
Wait at the fucking door!

335
00:31:45,661 --> 00:31:48,764
I can carry this, if you want.

336
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:51,200
Do you want me to carry it?
Sorry.

337
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,203
Follow me.

338
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,771
Okay.

339
00:32:01,277 --> 00:32:02,644
Wait here.

340
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:10,679
Hello, gorgeous.

341
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:16,453
What are you doing here, Nigel?

342
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:19,155
Partaking of the arts.

343
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,057
Care of the soul.

344
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:25,373
Listen, I happened to hear about Old
Victor's spectacular and horrible passing.

345
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,897
Came back to pay my respects.

346
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,169
How could you have heard? It
only just happened.

347
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,005
Now you know me.

348
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:39,176
always an ear to the ground when it comes
to the disposition of my darling Gabi.

349
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,649
Who's this then?

350
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,153
Who are you?

351
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:52,824
I'm Nigel. Who the fuck are you?

352
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:55,260
Charlie.

353
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:59,031
Who the fuck is Charlie, Gabi?

354
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:04,036
Charlie is an American tuba
player.

355
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:07,773
Here to observe the company.

356
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:10,410
He's homosexual.

357
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:15,948
Is he now?

358
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,085
Must make you quite the star
cocksucker around here, Charlie?

359
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:22,855
Nigel, what do you want?
Charlie, you should leave.

360
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:26,726
Charlie, you should stay.
Definitely.

361
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:38,505
As you know, darling Victor and I had
some unfinished business between us.

362
00:35:38,507 --> 00:35:41,041
What are you talking about?

363
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:42,910
My father hated you.

364
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:45,747
How do you guys know each other?

365
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:49,918
Nigel was my husband.

366
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,524
I beg your pardon, Gabi. Did you
say was?

367
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:58,793
Honestly? Fucking was?

368
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:00,028
Gabi...

369
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,863
No, Charlie, not fucking was.
Fucking is.

370
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:06,102
Fucking meaning I currently fucking
am 'til death do us fucking part.

371
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:09,205
You!

372
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:13,242
If it isn't the shrieking cunt
himself. Hello, Bela.

373
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:17,813
You will go immediately or I
will call the police!

374
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:18,948
Go!

375
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:26,356
Gabi, darling, we do need to
have a catch-up rather soon.

376
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:29,493
Say, sometime in the next 24
hours?

377
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:32,763
Bela, nice meeting you again.

378
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:37,134
Charlie, I'll catch you later.

379
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,008
You should go.

380
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:50,181
Where's a good place for me to
go, you think?

381
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:52,483
Marco Polo Youth Hostel.

382
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:55,620
It is nearby. Any taxi driver
will know it.

383
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:59,091
Okay. And I just say Marco Polo,
like if I was in the States?

384
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:04,897
What the fuck.

385
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:14,573
This is it?

386
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:17,911
Thank you.

387
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,182
Marco Polo, yeah?

388
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:23,516
Yeah.

389
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:34,160
Marco Polo?

390
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,600
This way?

391
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:41,168
Polo.

392
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:44,905
Polo!

393
00:37:48,009 --> 00:37:49,910
Which way?

394
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:54,382
My friend, my friend, my friend.
Marco Polo, yeah?

395
00:37:58,087 --> 00:37:59,421
What?

396
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:26,449
This the Marco Polo Youth
Hostel? Sorry.

397
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:33,156
Yes, my friend! Come on in!

398
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:34,424
What's your name?

399
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:35,292
Charlie.

400
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:38,161
Charlie, everybody. Hi Charlie!

401
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:39,429
What can I give you?

402
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:40,664
Just a room.

403
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:44,434
No passports in my kingdom,
baby. No bags?

404
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:45,869
No.

405
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:50,508
I have the perfect room for you,
Mr. No Bags! Thirty-four.

406
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,410
Do you want some gum, Charlie?

407
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:53,645
Yeah, sure.

408
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:54,712
Okay. Take it.

409
00:38:54,714 --> 00:38:56,147
Thank you.

410
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:58,950
Top floor. Enjoy.

411
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,361
Where the fuck have you been,
man?

412
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,498
You were supposed to be here,
like, yesterday!

413
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,000
They said 34 downstairs?

414
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,335
Come in, come in!

415
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:17,069
Thank you.

416
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:18,370
I'm Luke. This is Carl.

417
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:21,774
That's your bed there. Just make
yourself at home.

418
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,642
My name's Charlie.

419
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:26,346
Charlie. Nice to meet you.

420
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:30,517
Don't worry about him too much,
Charlie. He's on a program.

421
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,618
Really?

422
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,287
Carl, tell Charlie about your
program.

423
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,156
Please, Luke, don't take the
piss.

424
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:38,658
Listen to that, he's just a
little bit shy at first.

425
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,161
But trust me, that onion is
worth peeling.

426
00:39:41,163 --> 00:39:43,431
He's a crazy motherfucker! He's
a party animal!

427
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:46,167
You're gonna love him, I
promise. Come in, come in!

428
00:39:46,169 --> 00:39:48,803
Do you want some crisps?
They'll make your bullocks tingle.

429
00:39:49,142 --> 00:39:50,447
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, take a seat.

430
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:53,374
So, you guys been here for a
while or...?

431
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:57,111
I've been here... let me
think...

432
00:39:57,113 --> 00:39:58,813
Week? Few weeks?

433
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,681
Couple of months? I don't know.

434
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:04,219
It's been a bit of a blur, I got
to be honest, Charlie.

435
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:07,389
Been here six days, Charlie.

436
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:09,257
Oh, you're not together?

437
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:11,326
You know, like traveling
together, I meant.

438
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:14,262
Relax, okay? Look, he's not my
type, with him being ginger.

439
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:16,801
- Not having a pussy. You get what
I mean? - Right, right, right.

440
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:18,989
- You just get in today?
- Yes. Today. - Yeah?

441
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:22,657
- Where you come from?
- Chicago. - Chicago?

442
00:40:23,158 --> 00:40:26,109
Hey, Chi-ca-go!
That's my kind of town.

443
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:28,367
- Is it?
- Yeah, well, I've never been.

444
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:34,050
You like ecstasy, Charlie?

445
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:42,092
In answer to your silent question,
Charlie, this is why I love this guy.

446
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:45,229
He's fucking crazy! He's a party
animal!

447
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:48,265
We should go and get a few beers
or something. You up for that?

448
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:49,633
Beer? Yeah.

449
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:52,102
Great. Well, first round's on
you. Come, let's go!

450
00:40:52,104 --> 00:40:53,771
Three beers for the three
queers.

451
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:55,339
Thank you, sir.

452
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:59,444
Did Carl tell you? He's auditioning
to become a porn star.

453
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:00,712
Porn star?

454
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:02,047
Actor. You know.

455
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:04,883
I have no aspirations to star. I
simply want to act.

456
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:06,051
That is funny.

457
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:08,820
Tell him what your nom de porn's
gonna be.

458
00:41:08,822 --> 00:41:10,455
Boris Pecker.

459
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:15,828
Can you fucking... There is no
other name?

460
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,296
Boris! Boris Pecker.

461
00:41:17,298 --> 00:41:19,165
It could be nowhere else!

462
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:20,833
It's just like

463
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:22,735
I feel fucking weird right now,
man.

464
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:23,636
Charlie Charlie.

465
00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:24,737
I feel fucked right now, man.

466
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:25,805
How's your beer, how's your
beer?

467
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:29,842
I just feel fucked right now. I
mean...

468
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:31,777
Can I tell you my story?

469
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,480
Yeah.

470
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:36,783
So, this guy Victor, he died on my
fucking plane right next to me.

471
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,118
Oh, yeah?

472
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,255
And he gives me a hat, and it's
a gift for his daughter.

473
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:45,358
Her name's Gabi. Gabriela.

474
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,159
Right.

475
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:47,861
And she plays the cello.

476
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:48,929
Cello!

477
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:50,263
Yeah.

478
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:53,501
When you hear her talk, your
fucking heart stops.

479
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:56,637
Fucking amazing. This beer's
weird as shit, but

480
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,906
Having a good time? 'Cause it
looks like you're

481
00:41:58,908 --> 00:42:01,175
having a motherfucking good
time.

482
00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:02,577
Amazing. I felt like I love her.

483
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,745
I do, I do, I do! I feel like I
love her.

484
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:07,882
I have to make you aware,
Charlie.

485
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:11,687
Luke put Carpathian ecstasy in
your beer

486
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:13,555
You did? Who did?

487
00:42:13,557 --> 00:42:14,823
Yeah, yeah!

488
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:16,692
I did. Come on, listen...

489
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:17,426
Well, fuck, man!

490
00:42:17,428 --> 00:42:19,194
No, no, no, no, no, no!

491
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:20,863
No, no, it's fine, though!

492
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:23,198
It's fine. Mine and Carl's are
laced too.

493
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,934
We all have fucking trolley's at
the moment.

494
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:29,539
We're all in a zone of
mutuality.

495
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:30,874
We're all together, rising sun.

496
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:32,709
There's a naked girl!

497
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:35,211
Listen, your experience is your
own, yeah?

498
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:38,381
But we vote on shared
hallucinations, okay?

499
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:41,950
Any hallucinations in the zone
of mutuality must be voted on.

500
00:42:42,515 --> 00:42:45,770
Who here among us would
like all the women to be

501
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:48,538
naked or semi-naked right now?

502
00:42:49,962 --> 00:42:51,862
All right.

503
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:53,731
There is. Oh my God.

504
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:54,999
Having a good time?

505
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:56,200
These women are naked.

506
00:42:56,202 --> 00:42:57,968
This is my gift to you. Merry
Christmas.

507
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,937
Oh my god, oh my god!

508
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,563
Hello, Charlie.

509
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:37,507
Are you in the zone of
individuality also?

510
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:40,010
Sure.

511
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:41,878
Sure. Why not?

512
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,246
Okay.

513
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:47,484
Listen, I'm glad we bumped into
each other like this.

514
00:44:47,486 --> 00:44:51,454
I want to apologize for my
behavior.

515
00:44:56,361 --> 00:45:01,499
Charlie. The fucking love,
Charlie. The fucking love.

516
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:07,038
Turns me somewhat insane, if I'm
being honest with you.

517
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,105
Can I tell you that?

518
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:10,308
Be honest with me.

519
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:16,548
Regardless, I do apologize.

520
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:21,453
But I didn't wash my hands.

521
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:24,756
What's a little piss among
friends?

522
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,061
Oh, Charlie.

523
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:34,701
Enjoy your new mates and your recreational
drugs and the rest of it while you can.

524
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:39,072
God knows it can all turn into
blood in a blink of an eye.

525
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:40,406
Yes.

526
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:24,786
Your bag was in my car, Charlie.

527
00:46:24,788 --> 00:46:27,923
I left it at the hostel for you,
okay?

528
00:46:27,925 --> 00:46:31,093
You're married? What's up with
that?

529
00:46:31,095 --> 00:46:35,464
Walking with me? It could get
you killed.

530
00:46:35,466 --> 00:46:37,233
Charlie!

531
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:41,437
I'll just walk across the street.
I'll walk right here in the street.

532
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:58,021
I'm gonna help you. It's good.

533
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,990
What are doing?

534
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:18,240
You want to share a cavalla?

535
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:22,644
Maybe on our second date.

536
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,151
You like it?

537
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:34,589
It's my mother's favorite song.

538
00:48:36,593 --> 00:48:40,263
This was my father's favorite
restaurant.

539
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:48,938
I used to play cello right here
when I was young.

540
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,944
My father hated that he put me
in the place where I met Nigel.

541
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:59,975
He once ran through here cursing and
throwing candles at the curtains.

542
00:49:03,354 --> 00:49:06,623
It didn't work. He was very
drunk.

543
00:49:13,632 --> 00:49:17,168
Good place to be drunk.

544
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:20,939
Good sober food. I mean, these
are great donuts.

545
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:22,941
The best.

546
00:49:25,344 --> 00:49:28,580
Gabi, can I say something?

547
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,217
I understand.

548
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,680
When you lose someone who's...

549
00:49:36,053 --> 00:49:38,934
your home, you know,
you're only home in the world.

550
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:45,431
And when that happens you think,
oh fuck I should have had a back-up home.

551
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:48,465
Another person, a place,
a thing, something...

552
00:49:50,242 --> 00:49:53,212
...to make me feel safe,
and I don't have that.

553
00:49:55,677 --> 00:49:57,344
And now I'm lost.

554
00:49:57,346 --> 00:49:59,212
I am not lost.

555
00:49:59,214 --> 00:50:00,947
It's a process.

556
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,252
I am angry.

557
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,699
That's why I'm scared for you.

558
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:21,836
You know, for that picture in
your head.

559
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:23,838
Close your eyes.

560
00:50:29,412 --> 00:50:32,381
Get rid of that one. That one's
gone.

561
00:50:32,383 --> 00:50:36,652
That's gone. Blank slate.

562
00:50:40,723 --> 00:50:43,860
Pick a good one, a really good
one. One that's so good

563
00:50:43,862 --> 00:50:47,830
it'll keep the bad one unstuck.

564
00:51:10,422 --> 00:51:12,923
See?

565
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:25,437
Thank you, Charlie.

566
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:41,353
What are you doing?

567
00:51:41,355 --> 00:51:44,890
I'm gonna show you all these that I know.
I know all these positions.

568
00:51:44,892 --> 00:51:46,425
It's ballet.

569
00:51:46,427 --> 00:51:50,229
This is the motherfucker right
here. This is the one I know.

570
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:52,098
I'm not going to laugh.

571
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,433
Fucking, balance!

572
00:51:54,435 --> 00:51:58,371
That's a fucker. That's a
motherfucker.

573
00:52:01,843 --> 00:52:04,344
Time for goodbye, Charlie.

574
00:52:04,346 --> 00:52:07,481
No! We should go walk some more.

575
00:52:07,483 --> 00:52:10,817
Let's do it again. Let's just do
the whole path again.

576
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:13,120
It's a full moon! We get bikes,
we go ride around.

577
00:52:13,122 --> 00:52:15,823
We can do anything. We'll get
pancakes.

578
00:52:15,825 --> 00:52:16,858
No, I am sorry.

579
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,326
Why?

580
00:52:18,328 --> 00:52:20,895
It's like they say, another
time, another place. Right?

581
00:52:20,897 --> 00:52:23,431
Who's they? You got friends that
tell you what to do?

582
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:25,166
Fuck them, fuck they, fuck all
that.

583
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:26,601
'Cause this is, this is
important.

584
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:28,236
This. This, all this. This is

585
00:52:28,238 --> 00:52:30,471
This is big to us.

586
00:52:30,473 --> 00:52:32,373
To us?

587
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:35,344
Us. Two letters, whole world.

588
00:52:35,346 --> 00:52:39,148
Whole world like an oyster that you can
put the future and the past into, right?

589
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,583
And the middle is this "us"
thing.

590
00:52:41,585 --> 00:52:44,486
Which is a pearl which is us.

591
00:52:46,256 --> 00:52:48,857
Goodbye, Charlie.

592
00:52:51,896 --> 00:52:54,397
Stay. Okay?

593
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,198
Yeah.

594
00:52:58,569 --> 00:53:00,046
Charlie, please!

595
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:04,306
Yeah. I can't do that. I don't
know how to do that. I'm sorry.

596
00:53:09,446 --> 00:53:12,749
If you find me tomorrow,
I will kiss you.

597
00:54:27,696 --> 00:54:32,435
Remember, Charlie it can all
turn to blood in a blink of an eye.

598
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:54,089
Did you see a man here? A man
standing here?

599
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,625
Okay. Okay.

600
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:03,033
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

601
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:34,732
What the fuck, man? Please!

602
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:36,601
You need help, man. You're all
bloody.

603
00:55:36,603 --> 00:55:38,503
Yeah, I got hit by a car, Luke.

604
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:39,938
You need to see this.

605
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,744
Carl! Come out! Charlie's back!
Show him what you've done!

606
00:55:42,144 --> 00:55:44,183
- Can't I just see it in the morning?
- No, you've got to see this now.

607
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,525
I'm not coming out!

608
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:47,475
Stop being a baby and just get
out here, will you?

609
00:55:47,657 --> 00:55:49,322
He's a bit embarrassed
so just be cool.

610
00:55:49,618 --> 00:55:51,284
- And don't make a big deal out of this.
- He doesn't want to come out.

611
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,877
Come on, come on, come on!
It's fine, it's fine! It's fine.

612
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,548
- Holy shit.
- Right?

613
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,262
Goes for his job interview,
comes back looking like that!

614
00:56:03,264 --> 00:56:04,430
I don't feel well, Charlie.

615
00:56:04,432 --> 00:56:06,566
One viagra, I told him to take.
Two tops.

616
00:56:06,568 --> 00:56:08,701
Tell Charlie how many viagra you
took.

617
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,569
Five.

618
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:10,770
Fuck off.

619
00:56:10,772 --> 00:56:11,838
Six.

620
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,273
Five or six!

621
00:56:13,275 --> 00:56:14,375
These are Romanian viagra.

622
00:56:14,377 --> 00:56:16,176
Carl, why don't you sit down,
man?

623
00:56:16,178 --> 00:56:18,479
Let's go to a titty bar. It's my
only hope.

624
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:20,381
No, relieve the pressure!

625
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:21,815
Take him to a hospital, Luke.

626
00:56:21,817 --> 00:56:23,784
I'm not going out with you to a
titty bar.

627
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:26,820
You've got to come with us. Carl
needs you. He's in crisis!

628
00:56:26,822 --> 00:56:28,155
I just got hit by a car, right?

629
00:56:28,157 --> 00:56:31,091
Take a couple of codeine. You'll
be fine, all right?

630
00:56:31,093 --> 00:56:32,894
They let you travel with this?

631
00:56:32,896 --> 00:56:36,164
If I can't travel freely with my drum
of drugs, then the terrorists have won.

632
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:37,499
Five minutes, Charlie.

633
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:39,768
There we go. There we go. Don't
let it touch me though.

634
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,471
There we go. Come on. Easy. Easy
out the door.

635
00:56:45,608 --> 00:56:47,108
You speak Romanian, Luke?

636
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,243
Romanian?

637
00:56:48,245 --> 00:56:50,312
Yeah, my grandparents are
Romanian.

638
00:56:50,314 --> 00:56:51,814
How do you say I love you?

639
00:56:51,816 --> 00:56:53,149
I like to send a single
wildflower.

640
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:56,233
No, no, no. You got to say that
from the heart, Charlie.

641
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,033
You can't fuck around
with that shit.

642
00:56:58,441 --> 00:57:00,164
- No, how do I say I love you in
Romanian? - Oh, it's easy! It's easy.

643
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:02,494
- Te iubesc?
- Yeah.

644
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,689
So if I'm saying it to a girl, I say "Te
iubesc, Gabi" or "Gabi, Te iubesc. " or...

645
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:09,827
- Te iubesc, Gabi. She'll love it.
- After that? - Yeah, yeah.

646
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:12,277
- I can make you happy.
- No, thank you.

647
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:19,276
It's impossible. It's like
Sophie's Choice!

648
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:21,244
You guys have got to help me.

649
00:57:21,246 --> 00:57:25,148
Come on, guys! We can have a good time
without objectifying these women, surely!

650
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:25,916
Luke, it's a titty bar!

651
00:57:25,918 --> 00:57:27,518
Look! She's perfect.

652
00:57:29,588 --> 00:57:31,122
Yeah.

653
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:39,135
Come on, let's get you a drink.
What do you want?

654
00:57:39,551 --> 00:57:41,108
- One beer.
- Beer.

655
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:44,086
- Hey, hello!
- Hi.

656
00:57:44,638 --> 00:57:46,638
Excuse me, madam.

657
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:49,441
I've got a medical situation.

658
00:57:49,443 --> 00:57:52,811
Please let me introduces ourselves.
I'm John, this is Kevin.

659
00:57:52,813 --> 00:57:55,647
We're here on business, you see.
We're looking at the club.

660
00:57:55,649 --> 00:57:58,250
We think we might buy it! How
are your talking skills?

661
00:57:58,252 --> 00:58:01,186
We definitely could do with a
couple of admin girls in the

662
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:03,723
the Romanian district of our
office.

663
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:05,725
No.

664
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:33,154
Look over there. See?

665
00:58:38,493 --> 00:58:39,761
What's wrong?

666
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:41,796
I came in my pants.

667
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,167
All right!

668
00:58:49,872 --> 00:58:52,374
Hi, I'm Darko.

669
00:58:52,376 --> 00:58:53,608
Darko? Really?

670
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:56,278
Really. There's a problem?

671
00:58:58,248 --> 00:59:00,983
We have this bill here. It seems
pretty extravagant.

672
00:59:00,985 --> 00:59:04,287
Me and my friends had a couple
of beers. He got a lap dance

673
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:07,557
and it says 9,900 lei.

674
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,258
- Which is...
- It's crazy.

675
00:59:10,828 --> 00:59:14,363
I see this is correct due to
your friend shooting his load.

676
00:59:14,365 --> 00:59:16,032
His load? Are you serious?

677
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:21,205
How do I look to you currently?
Serious or unserious?

678
00:59:23,408 --> 00:59:26,543
Yeah, serious.

679
00:59:26,545 --> 00:59:28,412
Excuse me, Dorko.

680
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:32,816
My name is Darko. Darko.

681
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:35,920
And maybe if I put this pen
right into your asshole

682
00:59:35,922 --> 00:59:40,325
then write my name inside, you
will remember?

683
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,827
Something is funny?

684
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,598
Yeah. What you just said with
the pen-in-the-asshole thing.

685
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,335
I mean you can't actually write
inside someone's asshole.

686
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,472
It wouldn't actually help me
remember.

687
00:59:53,474 --> 00:59:55,975
How can you read inside your own
asshole?

688
00:59:55,977 --> 00:59:57,443
You wouldn't be able to read it.

689
00:59:57,445 --> 01:00:00,980
A guy's who's head is cut off
and then stuck up inside.

690
01:00:00,982 --> 01:00:02,681
That's not possible, is it?

691
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:05,985
If you cut his head off, he's not
going to be able to read anything

692
01:00:05,987 --> 01:00:08,854
because he'll be dead and you're
not gonna do that, are you?

693
01:00:09,258 --> 01:00:10,816
- Come here.
- What? - Come here.

694
01:00:12,494 --> 01:00:15,629
Darko, we're all staying at a
youth hostel

695
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:18,765
and they've been there for some
time, they've made some friends.

696
01:00:18,767 --> 01:00:23,770
So they would obviously, they
would notice if we didn't show up.

697
01:00:23,772 --> 01:00:26,072
And so if we can just

698
01:00:26,074 --> 01:00:31,879
So if we were to come up with a
dollar figure...

699
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:35,650
Is this photo making you stop
talking a lot?

700
01:00:35,652 --> 01:00:37,618
Do you know the man who I am
with?

701
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:42,790
Because how you look now is people who
know this man look like when they see him.

702
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:45,092
Or is it the girl that you know?

703
01:00:45,094 --> 01:00:47,595
Beautiful Gabriela?

704
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,067
Listen, boy.

705
01:00:54,037 --> 01:00:55,971
Listen.

706
01:00:55,973 --> 01:00:59,708
In my mind, this man
is not in Bucharest

707
01:01:00,232 --> 01:01:04,415
but it would be good for me to know if
my mind is wrong and he is in Bucharest.

708
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:10,987
Would it help our situation with
you if I did know?

709
01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:14,857
Stay within yourself now and try
to breathe.

710
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:18,294
Okay.

711
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:24,067
Now tell me, what do you know
about this man?

712
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:27,638
I'm gonna have to call you with that
information after we leave here.

713
01:01:29,174 --> 01:01:34,178
I really like your guts.
I really do.

714
01:01:34,648 --> 01:01:35,980
Come here.

715
01:01:38,392 --> 01:01:39,709
Come here.

716
01:01:41,887 --> 01:01:45,023
I will look into this question
by myself.

717
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:49,194
However, if I don't hear from
you tonight, latest tomorrow

718
01:01:49,196 --> 01:01:55,133
your boyhood faces will be made into
pork rind to be eaten by my dogs.

719
01:01:56,902 --> 01:01:58,503
And try to realize, my friend...

720
01:01:58,505 --> 01:02:01,907
no matter where you go now...

721
01:02:01,909 --> 01:02:03,542
this is how close I'm gonna be
to you.

722
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,847
Here. Take it.

723
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:32,139
What the fuck was all that shit
back there, Charlie?

724
01:02:32,141 --> 01:02:35,909
Are you in some Three Days of
the Condor shit or something?

725
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:39,013
No. It's Three Days of Condor...
It's nothing.

726
01:02:39,015 --> 01:02:40,515
I'll see you guys later, yeah?

727
01:02:40,517 --> 01:02:44,652
Yeah, alright.

728
01:02:44,654 --> 01:02:46,521
What's his problem?

729
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:49,490
He's just found out that the
girl that he loves

730
01:02:49,492 --> 01:02:51,993
could possibly be a skank
stripper, mate.

731
01:02:51,995 --> 01:02:56,465
Genuine ho bag.

732
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:31,568
Hey!

733
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:36,207
You cannot sleep here, sir.

734
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:38,909
Hey!

735
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:39,677
Bela!

736
01:03:40,645 --> 01:03:45,816
Good morning. Listen, I'm
looking

737
01:03:45,818 --> 01:03:47,084
It's evening, idiot.

738
01:03:47,086 --> 01:03:49,320
Is it evening? It is evening,
it's evening.

739
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:52,157
You must leave Gabriela be. She
grieves for her father.

740
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,494
She has suffered enough at the
hands of rogues such as yourself.

741
01:03:57,597 --> 01:03:58,663
Rogues open doors, Bela?

742
01:03:58,665 --> 01:04:01,766
Bela, do rogues open doors?
Please.

743
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:03,034
Get in.

744
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:50,585
I said if you find me, I would
kiss you.

745
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,606
Are you drunk?

746
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,917
What is it?

747
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:28,124
Charlie, tell me.

748
01:05:31,162 --> 01:05:35,632
I met Darko at his club.

749
01:05:38,669 --> 01:05:42,440
Let's just talk about it another
time. I'm sorry I brought it up.

750
01:05:42,442 --> 01:05:45,643
Darko? Fucking Darko?

751
01:05:48,947 --> 01:05:51,682
Charlie, do you have any idea
what kind of a man he is?

752
01:05:51,684 --> 01:05:54,285
Yes, of course. Yeah, I have a
very clear idea.

753
01:05:56,688 --> 01:05:59,291
What happened? You tell me now.

754
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:06,331
There was an incident and my
friend had an erection, and so

755
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:10,268
And they took you to the office.

756
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:14,206
They took me to the office.

757
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:15,474
I played it cool.

758
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:16,708
You played it cool?

759
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,846
Fuck yeah.

760
01:06:19,848 --> 01:06:24,851
I'm sorry. I find that hard to
believe.

761
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:28,087
Well, I did.

762
01:06:29,223 --> 01:06:29,989
Gabi?

763
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,354
You, sir. You cannot be here!

764
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:35,859
Charlie? You seen Gabi of late?

765
01:07:37,962 --> 01:07:38,695
She's not here.

766
01:07:38,697 --> 01:07:39,896
She's not here, is she?

767
01:07:39,898 --> 01:07:41,331
No.

768
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:46,236
Listen, I meant to ask you this
before.

769
01:07:46,238 --> 01:07:51,843
Okay, how can I put this?

770
01:07:51,845 --> 01:07:55,246
Can you do that Dizzy Gillespie
thing with your cheeks?

771
01:07:55,248 --> 01:07:58,816
You know, where he goes all
puffy-fish like?

772
01:07:58,818 --> 01:08:01,786
Being the champion tubaist- cocksucker
you are reputed to be?

773
01:08:03,255 --> 01:08:04,789
He was a trumpet player.

774
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,463
Come on, Charlie. Go on.

775
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:14,032
What?

776
01:08:17,437 --> 01:08:20,606
If that's not the most woeful bit
of puffy-fishery I ever did see.

777
01:08:20,608 --> 01:08:24,042
You know, it occurs to me, Charlie,
that maybe you're not a tubaist.

778
01:08:24,044 --> 01:08:26,479
Maybe you're not even
an actual faggot.

779
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:29,349
Maybe the truth of it is that
you've got designs on my wife.

780
01:08:29,351 --> 01:08:30,850
What do you think, Gabi?

781
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:39,092
You were meant to ring me,
darling.

782
01:08:40,227 --> 01:08:42,128
You need to leave, Nigel.

783
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,596
Now.

784
01:08:43,598 --> 01:08:47,368
The ass of an angel the brain of
a man, the aim of Annie Oakley?

785
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:50,538
Ever the total package,
my Gabi is.

786
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,907
Let's say I give you 'til
tomorrow to seek me out

787
01:08:52,909 --> 01:08:54,575
but that's the best I can do.
Agreed?

788
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:05,620
Guess I'm off then, Charlie.

789
01:09:05,622 --> 01:09:08,156
But we'll get a funny face out
of you yet, right?

790
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,068
Bela knows something?

791
01:09:52,237 --> 01:09:53,937
Bela will always know something.

792
01:09:55,555 --> 01:09:57,812
He's telling me that...

793
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:03,003
- ... it was my father who
made Nigel leave. - How?

794
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:10,457
There is some kind of tape
of Nigel doing something

795
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:15,226
and my father used it to make
Nigel leave Bucharest.

796
01:10:16,363 --> 01:10:18,063
This is the unfinished business.

797
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,469
With my father gone, Nigel and
Darko want to find the tape.

798
01:10:23,471 --> 01:10:26,405
How does this happen? How do you
meet a man like this? How?

799
01:10:41,656 --> 01:10:46,960
When I was a little girl my life
was music.

800
01:10:49,363 --> 01:10:50,130
Only music.

801
01:10:55,003 --> 01:11:00,107
And my father tried to introduce me to other
things, but there was nothing else for me.

802
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:05,646
To me it made no difference
where I was

803
01:11:05,648 --> 01:11:08,683
as long as I was playing.

804
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,375
What I did not know...

805
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:19,182
...was that above the
caf there was a small flat.

806
01:11:20,663 --> 01:11:23,699
And in this flat was Nigel.

807
01:11:26,302 --> 01:11:30,139
And he listen to my playing as
he struggled with his injuries.

808
01:11:32,776 --> 01:11:34,410
Every day he would hear me.

809
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:40,183
And every day he would become
stronger.

810
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,188
One day, he approached me

811
01:11:48,226 --> 01:11:51,462
He said my playing saved his
life.

812
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:58,769
And he was the most beautiful
man I had ever seen

813
01:12:01,373 --> 01:12:03,540
with his scars and eyes.

814
01:12:06,379 --> 01:12:08,780
It's like some kind of wounded
animal.

815
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:15,220
And I had no idea who he was or
what he did.

816
01:12:18,624 --> 01:12:22,060
All I knew was that he said my
playing saved his life.

817
01:12:27,401 --> 01:12:29,869
I learned a lot from Nigel.

818
01:12:29,871 --> 01:12:32,471
You know, things I otherwise
would not have learned.

819
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:40,546
Over time, I learned what he
was.

820
01:12:44,218 --> 01:12:45,552
By then it was too late.

821
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,727
I loved him.

822
01:13:07,776 --> 01:13:08,743
What is this?

823
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:14,348
There was minimal violence and
sex?

824
01:13:17,786 --> 01:13:18,820
Too much love.

825
01:13:24,494 --> 01:13:26,462
Nigel was the wrong person for
me.

826
01:13:28,264 --> 01:13:31,467
And wrong is wrong.

827
01:13:32,635 --> 01:13:33,602
What about Darko?

828
01:13:38,509 --> 01:13:39,476
What about Darko?

829
01:13:40,544 --> 01:13:42,946
I saw a picture of you at his
club.

830
01:13:42,948 --> 01:13:47,851
You were in your work outfit or
some other fancy

831
01:13:53,557 --> 01:13:55,793
So you live here, yeah?

832
01:13:55,795 --> 01:13:57,862
I thought this was Victor's
house, right?

833
01:14:00,398 --> 01:14:02,533
My father wanted me home after
Nigel left.

834
01:14:03,802 --> 01:14:04,869
Thank you.

835
01:14:04,871 --> 01:14:06,237
I was happy to do it.

836
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:13,811
Welcome to Bucharest, Charlie.

837
01:14:24,036 --> 01:14:28,660
It's like a Romanian grain
alcohol, like a rice wine?

838
01:14:28,662 --> 01:14:30,195
Shut up and drink.

839
01:14:31,464 --> 01:14:34,867
You're nervous. That's why we're
drinking this shit.

840
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:37,436
Drink.

841
01:14:39,493 --> 01:14:40,868
I'm nervous.

842
01:14:43,544 --> 01:14:45,244
So you think I danced for Darko?

843
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:50,684
Or maybe I was a whore.

844
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:53,921
I'm sorry I brought it up. I really
don't care. It doesn't matter.

845
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:56,723
I was a bartender, Charlie.

846
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,028
My job was to give drinks to
people.

847
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,463
I'm sorry I brought it up.

848
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:06,600
Forget I said anything. I don't
care.

849
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:10,371
You think you love me?

850
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:11,706
Yes.

851
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,384
Do you think things like this
happen to people?

852
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:24,719
Some people, yes.

853
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,414
What people?

854
01:15:30,405 --> 01:15:31,857
Us.

855
01:15:33,683 --> 01:15:34,975
Us.

856
01:16:19,678 --> 01:16:22,280
I remember all the things you
said to me.

857
01:16:24,684 --> 01:16:26,051
Every word.

858
01:16:31,991 --> 01:16:33,058
My mother died.

859
01:16:35,561 --> 01:16:36,928
Before I left, she died.

860
01:16:45,572 --> 01:16:46,939
You did not tell me.

861
01:16:50,577 --> 01:16:52,412
You've had a lot on your plate.

862
01:16:58,987 --> 01:17:00,954
Finally we have
something in common.

863
01:17:38,223 --> 01:17:40,683
"Dear Charlie, do not leave
this house. Your prize

864
01:17:41,429 --> 01:17:43,674
will be the BEST donuts,
and also me. Love, Gabi. "

865
01:19:34,317 --> 01:19:36,051
What brings you here, Charlie?

866
01:19:36,053 --> 01:19:38,887
You look a little bit pink, Charlie-boy.
Is everything all right?

867
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:40,088
Nothing amiss, it it?

868
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:41,623
I thought you were coming back.

869
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:43,859
What? What? You thought what?

870
01:19:43,861 --> 01:19:46,262
That a runty cunt such as you
are ever stood a chance?

871
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:49,298
Come on, son. This is reality
when you don't fucking register.

872
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,100
I register fine, you greasy
fuck!

873
01:19:51,102 --> 01:19:52,869
What's this now?

874
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:56,005
Certainly found the hard man within
our self, Charlie, haven't we?

875
01:19:56,007 --> 01:19:57,240
Charlie, get out of here!

876
01:19:57,242 --> 01:19:58,407
Let's listen to her.

877
01:19:58,409 --> 01:20:00,176
The clock's ticking on my
benevolence.

878
01:20:00,178 --> 01:20:00,910
I saw the tape.

879
01:20:00,912 --> 01:20:02,178
What tape, Charlie?

880
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:05,616
You know what tape.

881
01:20:05,618 --> 01:20:08,752
Gabi, darling...

882
01:20:08,754 --> 01:20:11,788
you just finished telling me you
had no idea about any of this.

883
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:14,658
Beause I have no fucking idea
what Charlie is talking about.

884
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:15,626
Nigel!

885
01:20:17,061 --> 01:20:19,029
Nigel, let him go!

886
01:20:22,701 --> 01:20:24,369
Where is it, Charlie?

887
01:20:24,371 --> 01:20:25,803
Where's what?

888
01:20:25,805 --> 01:20:27,071
Nigel, open the door!

889
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:28,373
The tape!

890
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:31,242
Surely, this is not what you
left home to find?

891
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:35,813
Your head in a plastic bag,
choking on your own fucking blood!

892
01:20:35,815 --> 01:20:37,715
I'm in charge, not you, fucker!

893
01:20:37,717 --> 01:20:39,618
Nigel, stop!

894
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:42,855
Charlie's in charge! Charlie has
the tape.

895
01:20:42,857 --> 01:20:46,125
I got you, Charlie. The only
explanation for the behavior

896
01:20:46,127 --> 01:20:48,627
that you're exhibiting is
that... Are you in love?

897
01:20:48,629 --> 01:20:50,396
Are you in love, Charlie?

898
01:20:50,398 --> 01:20:52,064
That's between me and your wife.

899
01:20:52,066 --> 01:20:53,299
Nigel, please!

900
01:20:53,301 --> 01:20:56,001
Gabi, Charlie's in love.

901
01:20:56,003 --> 01:20:58,305
Any idea who with? But something
tells me his name

902
01:20:58,307 --> 01:21:01,007
is not Kevin or Phillip or
fucking Andre.

903
01:21:01,009 --> 01:21:02,776
It's a she, fucker.

904
01:21:02,778 --> 01:21:07,314
Okay. Let's put a pin in the fucking
love story for now, shall we?

905
01:21:07,316 --> 01:21:09,382
I'd like to get back to my
primary agenda item.

906
01:21:09,384 --> 01:21:10,650
Where's the tape?

907
01:21:10,652 --> 01:21:12,118
Her name's Gabi.

908
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,821
No! Stop! Nigel, I told you, he
means nothing to me, okay?!

909
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:22,029
That was mean! We don't believe
you!

910
01:21:23,799 --> 01:21:25,199
Nigel, he's not important!

911
01:21:30,038 --> 01:21:32,039
Last chance for petrol, boy.
What tape?

912
01:21:33,175 --> 01:21:35,777
I'm in charge. I'm in charge.

913
01:21:40,316 --> 01:21:41,783
Welcome to limbo, Charlie.

914
01:21:41,785 --> 01:21:45,320
Don't get too comfortable. It's
not your final destination.

915
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:47,923
I'll be along soon enough to
hasten you there.

916
01:21:55,966 --> 01:21:57,700
What the fuck? He's up there!

917
01:21:58,702 --> 01:22:00,203
Let me go. We didn't do
anything!

918
01:22:18,757 --> 01:22:20,457
Hey.

919
01:22:20,459 --> 01:22:23,761
It's time to go, you know, sir.
Gabi doesn't want to see you again.

920
01:22:23,763 --> 01:22:25,029
She didn't say that to you.

921
01:22:25,031 --> 01:22:27,731
I choose Budapest for you. A
very nice place.

922
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:29,401
Safe and pretty.

923
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:31,136
I'm not going to Budapest. No,
Bela!

924
01:22:31,138 --> 01:22:32,437
You are going there, okay?

925
01:22:32,439 --> 01:22:34,406
Bela! Hey!

926
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:37,742
Bela, Bela, Bela! Hey!

927
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,210
Here we go, baby.

928
01:22:39,212 --> 01:22:42,047
What do you mean, here we go,
baby. Where are we going?

929
01:22:42,049 --> 01:22:43,281
Bags and Budapest.

930
01:22:43,283 --> 01:22:45,473
- I'm not going to Budapest.
- Good boy, aren't we?

931
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,362
Sorry?

932
01:22:56,364 --> 01:22:57,697
Go get your bags!

933
01:23:01,968 --> 01:23:03,335
Get my stuff?

934
01:23:04,471 --> 01:23:06,373
Do you want me to come with
you?!

935
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,340
Go! Five minutes.

936
01:23:25,561 --> 01:23:26,427
What's wrong?

937
01:23:26,429 --> 01:23:28,463
Evil guys are in the house.

938
01:23:28,465 --> 01:23:29,931
They left this for you.

939
01:23:29,933 --> 01:23:31,165
Who?

940
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:33,067
Oh, fuck

941
01:23:33,069 --> 01:23:35,570
I think you should run away.

942
01:23:35,572 --> 01:23:39,407
Yeah, run, run, run! Run away!

943
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,446
Oh, fuck!

944
01:23:55,592 --> 01:23:56,358
Thank you.

945
01:24:33,865 --> 01:24:34,832
Back up!

946
01:26:51,511 --> 01:26:52,344
Gabi!

947
01:27:02,789 --> 01:27:04,123
Long time no see, right?

948
01:27:06,527 --> 01:27:09,696
I think it's a good idea if you tell
me now everything that you know.

949
01:27:13,033 --> 01:27:14,000
Have a peek.

950
01:27:19,707 --> 01:27:22,676
See there's no ropes and tape or
anything? You know why?

951
01:27:22,678 --> 01:27:25,779
Because I used the super crazy
glue on them.

952
01:27:25,781 --> 01:27:29,717
If they move, rip! Off goes the
skin.

953
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:31,552
Nice, right?

954
01:27:31,554 --> 01:27:35,155
What the fuck do you want to know?
The fucking tape? I don't have the tape!

955
01:27:35,157 --> 01:27:38,092
The tape was here, the tape is
gone! That's all I know.

956
01:27:39,427 --> 01:27:40,194
Hello?

957
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,270
- Gabriela.
- Give me the phone.

958
01:27:43,627 --> 01:27:45,700
You sit your ass down.

959
01:27:45,702 --> 01:27:48,203
I'm here with this Charlie guy.

960
01:27:48,205 --> 01:27:51,099
- Let me ask him. Are you all
right, Charlie? - I'm fine.

961
01:27:51,408 --> 01:27:53,141
He's okay for now.

962
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:55,377
But we need to speak about this
tape.

963
01:27:55,379 --> 01:27:57,579
I hope this is why you're
calling me.

964
01:27:57,581 --> 01:27:59,749
Sure. Sure.

965
01:28:02,686 --> 01:28:05,788
I like this plan.

966
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:06,655
Hug, hug. Bye, bye.

967
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:10,192
What's happening? Where is she?

968
01:28:10,194 --> 01:28:11,994
Charlie.

969
01:28:11,996 --> 01:28:15,398
I'd love to sit down and explain it all
like in a fucking James Bond movie

970
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,035
but I get bored so fast. And I
have things to do.

971
01:28:18,736 --> 01:28:20,303
You look so fucked up.

972
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:23,407
Does this hurt?

973
01:28:55,241 --> 01:28:57,994
Gabi, oh, fuck.

974
01:28:59,258 --> 01:29:00,553
The tape?

975
01:29:01,012 --> 01:29:03,660
The tape, I went to the apartment to get the
tape and the tape wasn't there. I'm sorry.

976
01:29:04,151 --> 01:29:05,851
Forget about the tape, Charlie.

977
01:29:05,853 --> 01:29:07,753
What?

978
01:29:07,755 --> 01:29:10,856
Forget about all of it.

979
01:29:10,858 --> 01:29:13,693
This is the last time you will
see me. Do you understand?

980
01:29:15,496 --> 01:29:18,631
No. No, I fucking don't
understand.

981
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:19,866
Gabi, it's us.

982
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:21,768
There is no us.

983
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:22,802
It's us, right?

984
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:24,270
No.

985
01:29:24,272 --> 01:29:27,346
None of this happened until you
came along talking about us.

986
01:29:27,663 --> 01:29:30,595
Your mommy dies and you think
you can go on a big adventure

987
01:29:30,956 --> 01:29:33,212
to feel something different than
what you're supposed to feel!

988
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:35,049
No! Gabi, Gabi.

989
01:29:35,051 --> 01:29:37,651
Gabi, I know you're confused.
I'm fucking confused also.

990
01:29:37,653 --> 01:29:40,554
Hey! I'm confused also. But it's
us.

991
01:29:40,556 --> 01:29:45,559
It's the pearl, right? The rest
is oyster.

992
01:29:45,561 --> 01:29:47,394
I belong with Nigel.

993
01:29:47,396 --> 01:29:50,932
You said it was wrong. You said
it was wrong!

994
01:29:50,934 --> 01:29:52,000
Wrong is wrong!

995
01:29:52,002 --> 01:29:53,135
I was out of my head over my
father.

996
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,956
No, you were right, us!
It was real!

997
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:02,899
You did not think I could go
from loving someone like Nigel...

998
01:30:04,175 --> 01:30:06,312
...to loving someone like you.

999
01:30:12,689 --> 01:30:14,991
Go away!

1000
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:16,292
Go away, little boy.

1001
01:30:55,034 --> 01:30:56,834
Are you sure Darko understood?

1002
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:02,841
We meet, we destroy the tape.

1003
01:31:05,045 --> 01:31:06,212
Life goes on.

1004
01:31:15,055 --> 01:31:16,655
Did you want some more advice?

1005
01:31:22,563 --> 01:31:23,663
No advice. I'm good.

1006
01:31:28,803 --> 01:31:29,970
You were a great mom.

1007
01:31:31,939 --> 01:31:32,706
Solid B-plus.

1008
01:31:33,808 --> 01:31:34,574
B - plus?

1009
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:38,613
You bring me all this friggin'
way for a B-plus?

1010
01:31:38,615 --> 01:31:43,451
I'm joking with you, Mom. You
were an A.

1011
01:31:43,453 --> 01:31:46,053
You are an A.

1012
01:31:46,055 --> 01:31:49,357
You know what's funny?

1013
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:53,294
When I told you to go to
Bucharest, I meant Budapest.

1014
01:31:54,363 --> 01:31:55,663
I got them all mixed up.

1015
01:31:57,033 --> 01:31:58,000
It's classic me, right?

1016
01:31:58,002 --> 01:31:59,368
It is you.

1017
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:05,274
I'm so proud of you, Charlie.

1018
01:32:07,543 --> 01:32:10,779
I can see you've come exactly as
far as you needed to go.

1019
01:32:16,954 --> 01:32:17,920
Not quite.

1020
01:32:20,691 --> 01:32:22,392
I hope you don't die, kiddo.

1021
01:32:25,062 --> 01:32:27,664
And if I do, I die for love.

1022
01:32:30,067 --> 01:32:31,668
Pretty fucking cool way to go.

1023
01:32:46,651 --> 01:32:47,418
Charlie!

1024
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:50,654
You said everything I said was
in your heart.

1025
01:32:50,656 --> 01:32:51,855
What?!

1026
01:32:51,857 --> 01:32:53,725
Everything, I know that means
something.

1027
01:33:00,132 --> 01:33:02,167
Do you have your gun? Where's
the gun?

1028
01:33:02,169 --> 01:33:04,169
I don't know! I don't have it
here handy!

1029
01:33:04,171 --> 01:33:05,403
Wish me luck.

1030
01:33:05,405 --> 01:33:08,006
Oh, no, no, no! Charlie!

1031
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:05,434
Gabi, Gabi!

1032
01:34:13,476 --> 01:34:15,010
Is it true what they say,
Charlie?

1033
01:34:16,212 --> 01:34:20,149
Better to have loved and lost
and all that?

1034
01:34:20,151 --> 01:34:21,517
Please...

1035
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:40,537
You think you love me?

1036
01:34:41,672 --> 01:34:42,440
Yes.

1037
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:15,774
Gabi, Gabi...

1038
01:35:18,311 --> 01:35:19,512
Well...

1039
01:36:22,946 --> 01:36:27,616
Shot poor Charlie for love did
you, Gorgeous?

1040
01:36:35,259 --> 01:36:36,226
Charlie!

1041
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,734
Christ!
