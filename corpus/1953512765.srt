<i>[girl narrating]</i>
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>in a deep, dark forest</i>

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,126
<i>lived the Great Witch</i>
<i>of the Woods.</i>

5
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:29,061
<i>She was a fearsome,</i>
<i>powerful creature</i>

6
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,763
<i>who ate nothing but</i>
<i>the wayward children</i>

7
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,565
<i>foolish enough to wander</i>
<i>into her forest.</i>

8
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,768
<i>To lure them close enough</i>
<i>so that she could eat them,</i>

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,302
<i>she constructed</i>
<i>a beautiful house</i>

10
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,472
<i>made out of gingerbread</i>
<i>and candy.</i>

11
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,548
To the Great Witch
of the Woods,

12
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,484
we bring you
a soul to protect.

13
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,849
<i>The terror of</i>
<i>the Great Witch of the Woods</i>

14
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,717
<i>could only be defeated</i>

15
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,253
<i>by descendants of a long</i>
<i>bloodline of witch slayers.</i>

16
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,455
<i>And one day, two slayers</i>
<i>would finally emerge</i>

17
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,124
<i>worthy of the challenge.</i>

18
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,825
<i>They would be twins.</i>

19
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,794
Bring me more children.

20
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,662
I'm still hungry.

21
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,689
[school bell ringing]

22
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,607
Break it up.

00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,747
[groaning]

24
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,765
Why?

25
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,069
This is your third fight
this semester.

26
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,704
Do you want to get
kicked out of school?

27
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,411
Mom said Dad's furious.

28
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,578
Adam's not our dad.

29
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,014
Not if you keep this up.

30
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,021
[sighs]
Come on. Let's go.

31
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,463
[engine starts]

32
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,497
Are you sure
I can't change your mind?

33
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,766
I can't let him go alone.

34
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,369
He needs me.

35
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,471
Lebkuchen-Haus Academy.

36
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:16,007
This is one of most prestigious
private schools in the country.

37
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,844
Presidents,
vice presidents, CEOs...

38
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,546
Your father had to
pull a lot of strings
to get you in this school.

39
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,484
You mean Adam had
to pull a lot of strings.

40
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,753
If it was so important to him,
he should've been here.

41
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:31,156
I'm serious, Jonah.
This is a real
opportunity for you.

42
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,625
Don't blow it.

43
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,127
You take care of yourself.

44
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,429
You, too, Allyson.

45
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,433
Ella, you keep an eye
on your brother, okay?

46
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,568
You know I will.

47
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,870
If he gives you
any trouble--

48
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,738
I will.

49
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,074
All right.
Call anytime.

50
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,412
[engine starts]

51
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,757
Here we are.

52
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,125
Splendid.

53
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,895
So you must be
Jonah and Ella.

54
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:20,665
I'm Mr. Sebastian,
the headmaster here at
Lebkuchen-Haus Academy.

55
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,634
It is very nice
to meet you both.

56
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,869
Thank you.

57
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,104
Can I help
you with your bags?

58
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,807
That's fine.
I've got it.

59
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,676
How about the grand tour?

60
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,553
Your father spoke
very highly of you two.

61
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,890
I look forward
to challenging you
here in many ways.

62
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,792
Our academic program here
was ranked the highest
in the nation.

63
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,930
Our graduates have gone on to
Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.

64
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:56,001
In fact, 25% of last year's
graduating class

65
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,136
went on to
an Ivy League school.

66
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,873
Our baseball team
was first in the nation
three years in a row.

67
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,174
We're very proud of that.

68
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,776
I don't play.

69
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,711
You don't play baseball?

70
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,014
Well, that's okay.

71
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,050
I'm sure we'll find something
that interests you here.

72
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,153
It was lucky to have a spot
open up when it did.

73
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:19,591
While the majority of our
students come from high-income
families like yourself,

74
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,893
we also pride ourselves
with our outreach program,

75
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,662
offering a complete scholarship

76
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,264
to those worthwhile
individuals who need it.

77
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:30,201
In fact, most of our recipients
are actually orphans.

78
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,870
Jonah?

79
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:38,276
I was right.
You have found something
to pique your interests.

80
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,111
[laughs]

81
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,213
Let me show you
to your dormitory.

82
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,168
You must be
the roommate of the month.

83
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,936
Sorry?

84
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,939
Seems like they're always
sending the new kids in here.

85
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,843
Apparently I don't
play well with others.

86
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:12,978
Charles.

87
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,179
Jonah.

88
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,047
Nice to meet you.

89
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,650
So what brings you to Salem?

90
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,285
Fighting.

91
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,388
Relax, dude.
I'm not gonna hit you.

92
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,023
What about you?

93
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,758
Scholarship.

94
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,660
Our "world-famous
outreach program"

95
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:32,797
benefitting
the best and brightest
of the less fortunate.

96
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,766
They should call it
"drippings for the poor."

97
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:38,069
Well, I don't think
it gets any easier

98
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,971
just 'cause you're rich.

99
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,040
You know who says stuff
like that?
Who?

100
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,708
Rich people.

101
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,010
[chuckles]

102
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,812
That would be my adoptive
mom and dad, not me.

103
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,783
In that case,
welcome to freedom.

104
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,955
Just remember one thing.

105
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,890
What's that?

106
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,325
Watch yourself.

107
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,862
Around here, you either
eat or you get eaten.

108
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,333
I think I can
take care of myself.

109
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,870
We'll see.

110
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,444
Here we have our newest member
to the Lebkuchen-Haus family.

111
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,945
What's your name?

112
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,447
Ella.

113
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:26,451
Ella! Apparently Ella comes
to us all the way from 90210.

114
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,687
That's Beverly Hills
to you luddites.

115
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,188
She has a brother named Jonah.

116
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,691
Her dad is the vice president
of a bank,

117
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,225
and her favorite food is pizza.

118
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,161
Actually, it's sushi.

119
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,730
Good luck finding that here.

120
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,464
Kristen.

121
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,199
Welcome.

122
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,168
How did you know all that?

123
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,203
I'm senior editor
of the school paper.

124
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,405
If I didn't know
how to use Google,
I'd be pretty sucky at it.

125
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,240
Let me give you the tour.

126
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,210
Bed, desk, closet.
Right side's mine.

127
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,345
Bathroom's down the hall,
but if you have to go
number two,

128
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,014
I recommend using
the one on the second floor

129
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,248
because this one
gets backed up.

130
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,085
I'll keep it in mind.
Thanks.

131
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,324
What you working on?
Just a kick-ass story

132
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,793
that's gonna blow the lid
off this school.

133
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,228
Sounds juicy.

134
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,730
It's not ready yet.

135
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,931
Oh, sorry.

136
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,767
What's that one?

137
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,935
Stuff.

138
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,337
Really?
That's my favorite book.

139
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,973
Look, I'm under a deadline,
so just make yourself at home

140
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,742
and we'll hang later. Cool?

141
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,844
Oh, yeah, sure.

142
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,862
What Golding is trying to say
is that it is human nature

143
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:47,866
to reject the morality
and responsibilities
of civilization.

144
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:52,036
We take part in the system
because we need to survive.

145
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,973
But remove us
from that situation,

146
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:59,144
remove the need to follow
a certain code or set of ethics,

147
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:03,248
and we will regress
to our basic human nature.

148
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,350
Savages.

149
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,989
Am I not
interesting you, Jonah?

150
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,325
I was listening.

151
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,395
Then would you be so kind as
to repeat what I just said?

152
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,934
Why, Ms. Thoman?
They're all paying attention.

153
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,035
I'm sure they heard.

154
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,909
Humor me.

155
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,844
The book says
we're all savages,

156
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,512
and we only participate
'cause we have to.

157
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,349
An appropriate statement,
indeed.

158
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,455
God, can you at least pretend
you're paying attention?

159
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,103
[school bell ringing]

160
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,208
Hey!

161
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,379
Hey! You got
a problem, dude?

162
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,114
You want to take
your hands off me, man?

163
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,616
Yeah? You telling me
what to do?

164
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,484
Why don't you just
mind your own business?

165
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,621
Why don't you go
mind your own?
Leave my sister alone, okay?

166
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,123
Oh, look at this guy
right here!

167
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,095
What, are you jealous?

168
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,131
Here we have
a textbook example

169
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,933
of two male members
of the species

170
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,202
engaged in a competition
to establish dominance

171
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,405
over the most eligible
female of the pack.

172
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,907
She's probably in heat.

173
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,043
You keep away from her.
Who?

174
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,412
I saw you looking at her.

175
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,349
Maybe she just wanted to see
what a real man looks like.

176
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,985
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
that's really funny,
isn't it?

177
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,888
Is that why
you're on the ground?

178
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,557
Who is that?

179
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,026
Landon?
Only the school's top jock.

180
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,195
Your brother must have done
something to piss him off.

181
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:07,272
We don't fight
amongst ourselves.

182
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,974
Oh, yeah?
Apologize.

183
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:10,975
Sorry.

184
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,044
Make me believe it.

185
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,313
All right, get the hell
out of here. Move!

186
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,962
[school bell ringing]

187
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,597
Your brother
better be careful.

188
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,199
Landon and Megan,
they practically
run this school.

189
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,302
Same crap,
different school.

190
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,537
It's the law of nature,
didn't you know?

191
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,715
One day. That's got
to be a new record.

192
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,750
He was nothing
I couldn't handle.

193
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:30,188
I thought we both agreed
it was going to be
different this time.

194
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,590
What was I supposed to do,
just walk away?

195
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,561
I just want you to be
careful. Dad said--

196
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:40,264
Yeah, I wouldn't want
to disappoint the parents,
would I?

197
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,567
He's the only real father
you've ever had.

198
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,570
You've gotta realize he
just wants the best for you.

199
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:48,673
By shipping me off and
making me someone else problem?

200
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,675
He's trying
to help you, Jonah.

201
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,243
I'm trying to help you.

202
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,245
Yeah, well,
no one asked you to.

203
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,450
I just want you
to be careful.

204
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:03,054
You know, for once I'd
actually like to be someplace
where I actually fit in.

205
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,795
Look at him.
He's a total jerk,

206
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,564
but everyone respects him,
everyone likes him.

207
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,734
Maybe I'd like to know
what that feels like for once.

208
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,303
Who cares
what anyone thinks...

209
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,372
as long as
we stick together.

210
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,074
That's easy for you to say.

211
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,109
No matter what school
we end up in,

212
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,513
you always end up
getting good grades,
making friends.

213
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,448
It's not that easy for me.

214
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,753
Jonah...

215
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,156
Screw this place.

216
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,106
Hey. I'm Megan.

217
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,674
Ella.

218
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,743
That's your brother, right?

219
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,378
Yeah.

220
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,580
He's little young,
but cute.

221
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,484
Look, we don't want
to cause any trouble.

222
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,653
Yeah. Sorry about
what happened.

223
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:13,224
My boyfriend can be
a little possessive.

224
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,292
Truce?

225
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,161
Yeah.

226
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,398
[scoffs]

227
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,500
This is so <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

228
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,802
Does Grandma know
you took it?

229
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,138
It's my parents'.

230
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,675
Hear that? Sounds like
someone's got some
mommy-daddy issues.

231
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,176
Stop it!

232
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,379
Guys, we're hurting
her feelings.

233
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,384
Why don't you and Raggedy Andy
go find another school?

234
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,786
Just give it back.

235
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,788
Now beat it.

236
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,229
What is this?

237
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,565
I'll see you after school.
All of you.

238
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,368
Everyone,
mind your own business.

239
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,445
Wait!

240
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,182
Are you hurt?

241
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:15,153
In my time, they would've
put a frog in your lunchbox
and called it a day.

242
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,389
It's fine.
I can handle it.

243
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm Ms. Keegan.
I'm the guidance counselor here
at Lebkuchen-Haus.

244
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,928
Ella.

245
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,731
I know it can be hard
adjusting to a new school,

246
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,467
so please, if you need anything
or you just want to chat,

247
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,402
you can call me anytime.

248
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,804
If you don't mind,
I'd like to be excused
to my room now.

249
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,641
Take all the time you need.
And don't worry.

250
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,310
I'll see to it the girls
get punished appropriately.

251
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,645
Thank you.

252
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,748
You know, we don't get
many twins here.

253
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,849
It's interesting.

254
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,835
<i>[voice whispers]</i>
<i>Gretel...</i>

255
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,868
That's some good reflexes
you got there, bro.

256
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,037
Coach could use
a guy like you.

257
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,705
I'm not interested.

258
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,642
Oh, really? You know,
we're first in the state.

259
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,344
Yeah. Three years in a row.

260
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,346
I'm not the team type.

261
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,386
You know this mysterious
loner thing you got going?

262
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,688
That shit
doesn't work here, man.

263
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,690
Why are you
even talking to me?

264
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,625
I like to win.

265
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:39,630
And I think our chances would be
better with you on the team.

266
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:46,937
Look, about before,
I'm sorry about that.

267
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:47,972
Okay?

268
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,808
No hard feelings?

269
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,514
At least come check it out.

270
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,516
Tomorrow morning
before school.

271
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:04,855
This is where you practice?

272
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,590
Think of it as a warm-up.

273
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,430
Hmm?

274
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,533
Not interested.

275
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,401
Oh, really?

276
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,403
Your loss, bud.

277
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,881
[knocking]

278
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,616
Come in.

279
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,920
Hey.
Hi.

280
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,054
Is Jonah around?

281
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,422
I haven't seen him.

282
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,358
I'm Ella, his sister.

283
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,793
Ella.

284
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,730
I read in the paper.
You like pizza, right?

285
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,432
Actually, it's sushi.

286
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,668
I heard about what happened
in the courtyard.

287
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,869
Word travels fast, huh?

288
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,504
Well, I heard
Megan and her friends

289
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:54,939
have to peel potatoes
all night.

290
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,410
I'm Charles.
I'm Jonah's roommate.

291
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,413
Are you leaving?

292
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,715
Things are getting
too crazy around here.

293
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,450
It's not safe.

294
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,919
What are you talking about?

295
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,654
All the dropouts.

296
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:13,491
How do you think
you and your brother
were able to get in?

297
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,826
I don't understand.

298
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,895
The last one, Barry,

299
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,531
they said they found him
wandering the courtyard
in the middle of the night.

300
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,666
He didn't even remember
his own name.

301
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,935
He just... snapped.

302
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,806
Like something
sucked his soul out
and left him like a shell.

303
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,141
Like a zombie.

304
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,976
Really?

305
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,811
Something funny's
going on.

306
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,013
I'm not gonna wait around
to be next.

307
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,583
Where did you get that?

308
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:43,020
Oh. It's my roommate's.
You know this book?

309
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,791
Look, if you know
what's good for you,

310
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,859
you'll get you and
your brother as far away
from here as possible.

311
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,461
You hear me?

312
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,054
[door closes]

313
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,857
Hello?

314
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,953
Hello?

315
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,235
[thud]

316
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,534
Hello?

317
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,780
Is anybody here?

318
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,037
Hello?

319
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,601
Who's there?

320
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,373
Hello?

321
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,186
You made it.

322
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,823
This isn't a warm-up, is it?

323
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,794
Uh, no, it's not.

324
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,897
Don't worry.
We don't bite.

325
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,066
What is this place?

326
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,869
This is The Circle.

327
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,838
The Circle? What's that?

328
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,874
Did you know this school
was originally founded
by witches?

329
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,175
Are you serious?

330
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,010
Each year,
the most promising students

331
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,846
are selected
to join The Circle

332
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,848
in order to fulfill
their potential.

333
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,983
Potential?

334
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,885
Greatness.

335
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,488
So it's like some kind
of secret society?

336
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,257
This school has had three
presidents attend here,

337
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,493
two governors,
four senators.

338
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,361
Our brothers and sisters
of The Circle

339
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,498
have gone on to
take their place among
the highest top echelons

340
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,068
of business, science,
medicine.

341
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,505
Because they realized
their potential.

342
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:38,408
What do you mean?
Like they used magic?

343
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,777
Isn't that cheating?

344
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,325
How'd you do that?

345
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,361
We can all do that.

346
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,063
That's what
The Circle's about.

347
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,900
Once your power's awakened,
you can do anything you want.

348
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,802
Anything?

349
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,271
Look, there are
no tricks here.

350
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,807
No optical illusions
or anything.

351
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:12,442
Everything you see
is real.

352
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,344
You can do this, too, Jonah.

353
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,081
It's okay.

354
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,885
We all stood
where you are now,

355
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,887
and we said
the same thing.

356
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,458
You can make anybody do that?

357
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,296
Not anybody.
You have to be special.

358
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,064
It's passed down.

359
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,334
My mother's side of the family
was originally from Europe.

360
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,869
I have her blood inside me.

361
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,871
This is crazy.
I'm an orphan.

362
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:42,906
I barely know my parents.

363
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,209
How do I know if I'm descended
from anything like this?

364
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:49,112
There's a mark on
the back of your head,
just above the hairline.

365
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,547
It's a circle.

366
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,316
How'd you know that?

367
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,318
Well, I have one, too.

368
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,220
A birthmark?

369
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,955
Think of it
as a birth rite.

370
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,157
Whether you realize it
or not,

371
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,626
you were meant
to come to this school
since the day you were born.

372
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:05,095
What about fate?

373
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,997
Who do you think
controls fate?

374
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,370
Look, you have
this power, too, Jonah.

375
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,372
Let us help you awaken it.

376
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,908
But remember,
what happens here,

377
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,911
what you see,
what you experience...

378
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,146
You don't tell a living soul.

379
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:29,253
That is the price.
We must always
work in secret.

380
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,523
So you haven't seen her
since last night.

381
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,992
She said she was gonna be
working on her paper all night.

382
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,293
Well, I realize
your concerns,

383
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,696
but you have to remember
this is a high school.

384
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:48,665
Kids have fun,
they take off,
do stupid things.

385
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,368
She didn't seem
like the type.

386
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,737
You'd be surprised
what I found going on here.

387
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:56,974
I've heard there's been
a lot of dropouts.
Is that true?

388
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,343
Lebkuchen-Haus is
one of the top schools
in the country.

389
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:03,347
Its academic program
is disciplined, strict,
second to none.

390
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,750
From time to time we get
students who simply can't
handle the pressure.

391
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,286
And they just all happen to be
part of the outreach program?

392
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,688
Well, actually,
the outreach program
was my idea.

393
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,491
I was tired of seeing
nothing but privileged
trust-fund babies

394
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,261
with their private tutors
and sense of entitlement.

395
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,497
I thought it'd be good
to bring in some new blood.

396
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,400
But unfortunately
the students in
the outreach program

397
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,135
were less likely to have
the kind of support system

398
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,604
that some of
the more affluent
students can afford.

399
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,107
They become overwhelmed.

400
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,376
We do what we can to help,
but it's inevitable

401
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:35,445
that some are simply eaten up
by the system, as it were.

402
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,681
Eaten up by the system?

403
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,717
But, Ella, your grades,
your test scores,

404
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,086
you're too smart
to be worrying about
the other students.

405
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,423
Let me worry about them.
It's my job, not yours.

406
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:50,527
In the meantime, I wouldn't be
surprised if Kristen was back
in the room right now.

407
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,430
Probably sleeping off
whatever it was she did
last night.

408
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,032
Probably.

409
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,334
Remember,
I'm always here for you.

410
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,261
Charles, I really need
to talk to you.

411
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,648
Let's see.

412
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,152
<i>Circles.</i>

413
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:23,653
<i>I see them everywhere.</i>

414
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:27,691
<i>I'm gonna follow them</i>
<i>and see where they lead.</i>

415
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:30,260
<i>They're taking students out</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

416
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,496
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>or what happens exactly,</i>

417
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,764
<i>but they're never the same.</i>

418
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,704
<i>Something's happening.</i>

419
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,384
<i>Whoever that is, I think</i>
<i>he's the one behind it.</i>

420
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,426
What the heck
is going on here?

421
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,798
[cell phone ringing]

422
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,470
Don't feel like
talking, huh?

423
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,972
Ella.

424
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,474
What were you doing
in the woods?

425
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,479
What are you
talking about?

426
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:00,317
I followed Mr. Sebastian there.
I saw you.

427
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,586
Wait. You're stalking
the headmaster?

428
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,354
Something strange is
going on at this school,

429
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,789
and my roommate thinks
he's behind it.

430
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,892
What do you mean,
something strange?

431
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:12,295
I don't know.
You tell me,

432
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,731
since you were there
with your new friends.

433
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,600
Is that what
this is about?

434
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:19,436
It's funny what a difference
a day makes.

435
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,371
Landon apologized
for what he did.

436
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:24,374
What about
me and his girlfriend?
She--

437
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,843
She embarrassed me
in front of the whole
entire school.

438
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,812
I'm sure she's sorry.

439
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:31,648
Oh, so you're speaking
for her now, huh?

440
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,951
What's your problem?
My problem is that you're making
friends with the wrong people.

441
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,653
Or maybe
you're just jealous.

442
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,688
You can't be serious.

443
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,758
Jealous that
I've made friends
and you haven't?

444
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,794
You know,
for once you're not
the center of attention,

445
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,564
or the good little girl
who has to rescue
her poor brother.

446
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,434
Look...

447
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,903
I'm just watching out for you.

448
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:56,006
I mean, if there was
something going on,

449
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:59,776
I just want you
to be careful.

450
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,445
No one asked you to come.

451
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,447
I was trying to help.

452
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:08,418
Doesn't appear
that I need it now, do I?

453
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,753
[scoffs]

454
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,893
If there was something
going on,

455
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,896
if you did know something,
you would tell me, wouldn't you?

456
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,932
Of course.

457
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,534
Why wouldn't I?

458
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,471
Okay, then.

459
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,042
See you around.

460
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,083
What were you
working on, Kristen?

461
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,632
What is going on here?

462
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,145
<i>[Greta reading]</i>
<i>"In the Old World,</i>

463
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:17,647
<i>witches and warlocks</i>
<i>lived together in harmony,</i>

464
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:22,519
<i>using their abilities for good</i>
<i>to help their non-magical</i>
<i>brothers and sisters.</i>

465
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,454
<i>However, when the New World</i>
<i>was discovered,</i>

466
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,556
<i>one of them, a young</i>
<i>and ambitious witch,</i>

467
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:29,692
<i>saw the opportunity to use her</i>
<i>powers to rule the new land.</i>

468
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,195
<i>She called herself the</i>
<i>Great Witch of the Woods.</i>

469
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:35,498
<i>Unwilling to sit back</i>
<i>and watch as centuries</i>
<i>of goodwill were undone,</i>

470
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,567
<i>a group of witches</i>
<i>broke off from the rest,</i>

471
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:40,103
<i>dedicating their lives</i>

<i>who would use</i>
<i>their powers for evil.</i>

473
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:45,008
<i>They became witch slayers.</i>

474
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,178
<i>Most of the Great Witch's</i>
<i>original followers</i>
<i>known as The Circle</i>

475
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,880
<i>were executed during</i>
<i>the Salem Witch Trials.</i>

476
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,916
<i>However, she soon found</i>
<i>new followers.</i>

477
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,884
<i>And now over 400 years old,</i>

478

<i>the only way for the Great</i>
<i>Witch of the Woods to survive</i>

<i>is feed on the souls</i>
<i>of the young.</i>

480
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,491
<i>The Circle's job</i>

481
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,092
Oh, my.

482
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,769
Wow.

483
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,142
"The Circle." Now,
that's something I haven't
heard about in a long time.

484
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,910
So you have heard about it.

485
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,880
Of course. I was a student here
once myself, you know.

486
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:27,617
Walk this campus long enough,
and you'll hear all kinds
of stories.

487
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:28,985
So is it true?

488
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,088
This school was founded
in 1829 by Benjamin Corey,

489
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,190
one of the descendants of
Giles and Martha Corey,

490
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,593
who were both executed
in Salem in 1692

491
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:38,828
as part of
the Salem Witch Trials.

492
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,897
There are some students
who believe that Benjamin

493
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:45,235
started a secret society
called The Circle.

494
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:50,573
A secret society which advanced
his ancestors' teachings
among the privileged few.

495
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:51,841
What do you think?

496
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,743
The school has never
officially acknowledged

497
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,713
the existence
of secret societies.

498
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:59,282
But you
as a former student...

499
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:02,285
Are you familiar
with the stories
of the Brothers Grimm?

500
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,721
Fairy tale?
Are they?

501
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,756
Is it possible
that their stories,

502
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:10,159
from "Hansel and Gretel"
to "Rumplestiltskin"

503
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,829
were actually written
with an entirely different
purpose in mind?

504
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,197
Such as?

505
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,099
There are some people
who think that the brothers

506
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,901
were involved in these
ancient rituals,

507
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:20,703
and that their stories
were actually warnings

508
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,206
passed down from
generation to generation.

509
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,841
To warn people
about the Circle.

510
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:27,076
Do you know what the words
"Lebkuchen-Haus" mean?

511
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:27,944
No.

512
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:29,879
Gingerbread house.

513
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,748
Where the Great Witch
would lure her prey.

514
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,717
Look, they're just stories.

515
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,153
But--
Do me a favor.

516
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:40,123
Don't get involved.
Stay out of it.

517
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,025
But if The Circle is real,

518
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:44,327
and the Great Witch
of the Woods is real,

519
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:46,696
then witch slayers
might be real.

520
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,731
No good can come from this.

521
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,234
But Kristen might
have found something
that cost her her life.

522
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,603
It's ancient history.

523
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,605
And if it isn't?

524
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:58,308
There might be witch slayers
at this school right now.

525
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,744
Look, if I promise
you to look into it,

526
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,746
will you agree
to leave it alone?

527
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,617
Yeah. Thank you.

528
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,252
You're welcome, Ella.

529
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,992
Uh--
Everything
all right, Ella?

530
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:19,862
Yeah. I'm just gonna
get going. Excuse me.

531
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,160
My parents were witch slayers?

532
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,308
Lebkuchen-Haus.

533
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:10,533
[line ringing]
Come on, pick up, pick up.

534
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,475
Hey, Jonah, it's Ella.

535
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:24,046
Please call me back
as soon as you get this.

536
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:25,448
Okay, bye.

537
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,521
All right,
let's get him.

538
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,415
Come on, Jonah, open up
if you're in there.

539
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,256
Jonah.

540
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,241
[door closes]

541
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:00,243
[footsteps]

542
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,551
This is what we do.

543
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:11,454
We help souls cross
into a better place.

544
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:14,190
What do you mean, cross?

545
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:16,092
The world's a dark
and nasty place.

546
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:21,931
It is our responsibility
to help those souls less
fortunate than ourselves

547
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:25,001
to find the light,
to find paradise.

548
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:27,570
Once you've helped,

549
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:30,640
the Great Witch
will reward you and
awaken your powers.

550
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:34,443
The other day you said after
your powers are awakened,
you can do anything.

551
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:37,079
You can,
and you will.

552
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,684
What's going on?

553
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,352
Just watch.

554
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,395
Charles.

555
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:53,930
Charles.

556
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:55,498
Jonah, what's going on?

557
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,400
Silence.

558
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,205
Megan?

559
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:05,508
It's her turn
to be awakened.

560
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,246
Don't let them do this.

561
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:13,049
Don't worry.
This is a good thing.

562
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,418
Please!

563
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,724
To the Great Witch
of the Woods,

564
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:24,093
we bring you
a soul to protect.

565
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,576
Come on, Jonah,
do something.

566
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,983
What'd you do to him?

567
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:48,985
Don't worry.
His body's still here,

568
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:50,586
but his soul's
in a better place.

569
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,688
What happens now?

570
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,391
She has awakened.

571
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,477
[bell tolling]

572
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:20,649
We need to talk.

573
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,640
Witch slayers?

574
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,076
Yes, and their ancestors
before them,

575
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:50,246
all going back
to the original Grimms,
Hansel and Gretel.

576
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:51,280
The fairy tale.

577
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:52,615
It's true.

578
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:55,584
Do you know what
"Lebkuchen-Haus" means?

579
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:58,754
Gingerbread.
Just like the book.

580
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:01,257
[scoffs]
I'm going back to bed.

581
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:02,625
In fact, they were twins.

582
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:04,693
The only twins before us.

583
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,596
I mean, that's gotta
mean something.

584
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:12,735
It means two separate eggs
fertilized by two separate
sperm. That's it.

585
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,471
Don't you get it?
Our parents--

586
00:51:15,473 --> 00:51:18,307
Our real parents
went to this school.

587
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:23,179
You want us to follow
in their footsteps
as witch slayers?

588
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:24,647
Look, this is their journal.

589
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,782
The last entry
from Greta said,

590
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:30,352
"I know she's close.
I can feel it.

591
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:31,854
Tonight we're gonna
stop her."

592
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:33,856
Stop who?

593
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,658
The Great Witch
of the Woods.

594
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,726
Okay, what happened?

595
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,328
Don't you get it?

596
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,530
They came here to stop her,
and now she's back.

597
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:43,332
You really believe that?

598
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:46,869
Well, maybe
that's why we're here,

599
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:48,838
to finish
what our parents started.

600
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,874
If that's really true,
I say let someone else
handle it.

601
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:54,376
There's no one else
on the list.

602
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:56,245
If there were other
witch slayers in this school,

603
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:58,180
they've kept
their identities a secret.

604
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,182
Of course they have.
[chuckles]

605
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:06,155
And I suppose that this
is some kind of magical
witch-slaying weapon?

606
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,592
I don't know.

607
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,696
Well, you're wrong.

608
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:15,564
The witches aren't here
to hurt people.

609
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:16,899
They're here to help.

610
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:19,201
Oh, is that
what they told you?

611
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,737
They're here to help souls
cross to the other side,

612
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,272
to a better place.

613
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,473
They've been freed.

614
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,708
Like Charles?

615
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,610
Yeah.

616
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:29,745
I was there.
I saw what happened last night.

617
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,480
He's in
a better place now.

618
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,415
They're feeding souls to
the Great Witch of the Woods.

619
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:34,783
Do you know
how crazy that sounds?

620
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:38,287
Do you know how crazy
any of this sounds?

621
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:41,423
They told me I was special,
that I have a gift.

622
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,359
You probably have it, too.

623
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,596
We are special.

624
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:50,232
We have powers.

625
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:52,501
Come to the next meeting
with me. Let me show you.

626
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,704
Join? We're supposed
to be stopping them.

627
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,773
Maybe you're wrong.

628
00:52:57,775 --> 00:53:00,376
Maybe our birth parents
wanted us to come here

629
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:03,579
to make the most
of our abilities.

630
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:09,618
For the first time
in my life, I fit in.

631
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,620
I'm popular.

632
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:14,290
I'm not about
to jeopardize that.

633
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:19,328
Look, something bad has
happened to your roommate,

634
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,597
and maybe one of us
is next.

635
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,334
I've heard enough.

636
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,614
"Originating from old
Germanic tradition,

637
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,816
the blade is formed
from a special metal

638
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,352
created through
the process of alchemy.

639
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:19,755
It is known to be effective in
the hunting of magical beings,

640
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,624
including witches."

641
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,940
What you have to remember
is that it was a sailor's
responsibility

642
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:40,542
to stay aboard the <i>Patna</i>
<i>until everyone was rescued.</i>

643
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:44,747
To abandon their post
was viewed as a crime.

644
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:48,017
So not only was Jim a coward,
he was a criminal

645
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:51,687
for abandoning the people
who counted on him the most.

646
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:56,392
Can anyone tell me how it was
that Jim found redemption?

647
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:02,898
Ella?

648
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,867
Yes, ma'am?

649
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:06,835
Well, since you're paying
such close attention,

650
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:10,773
perhaps you could tell the class
how Jim finds redemption
in the story?

651
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:14,576
Well, I, uh--

652
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:15,811
No, ma'am.

653
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:21,583
[school bell rings]

654
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:24,320
Read chapters 19 through 23
for next time.

655
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,862
What's going on, Ella?

656
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:37,499
I'm sorry. I just haven't
been able to sleep lately.

657
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,436
Well, I read your transcripts
from your last school.

658
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,638
Absolutely outstanding.

659
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,074
The last couple of days,
you have seemed distracted.

660
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:48,477
I know.
I'm just not focusing.

661
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,113
Well, you're
a brilliant student,

662
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:53,816
and I'd hate to see
someone like you lose focus.

663
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,885
It won't happen again.

664
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:58,487
I promise.

665
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:00,489
I hope not.

666
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,733
Don't worry about her.

667
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,543
Good job.

668
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,078
Thanks.

669
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,079
Excellent.

670
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,481
Thank you.

671
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,617
Pretty good.

672
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,654
Awesome, as always.

673
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,785
Hey, I don't mean
to intrude.

674
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:05,087
Are you okay?
You look exhausted.

675
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:08,524
Yeah. I was just wondering
if you've heard anything
on Kristen.

676
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:11,527
As a matter of fact,
her mother just called me
this morning.

677
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:13,529
She did?
Apparently Kristen
was stressed out

678
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:15,130
about some story
she was writing,

679
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,965
and she needed
some time off.

680
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,434
So why didn't she call?

681
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,002
You look so tired.

682
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,904
Why go don't you go back
to your room and get some rest?

683
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,439
I'd be happy to write
a permission slip

684
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:24,640
if you need
to skip a class.

685
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,175
That's fine. Thank you.

686
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:27,643
Anytime.

687
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,918
[heart beating]

688
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,532
No way!

689
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:56,939
Mind if I come in?

690
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:59,107
I'm actually doing
some homework.

691
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:00,676
Thanks.

692
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:02,511
[door closes]

693
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,015
You seem troubled.
What's wrong?

694
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:10,085
Nothing. Just getting
some homework done.

695
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,690
You've been practicing.

696
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:16,592
Maybe a little.

697
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,894
What was it? Tell me.

698
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,065
Just this.

699
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:26,034
I made it move.

700
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:29,972
Like... this?

701
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,041
That's incredible.

702
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,077
First thing I ever moved
was my cell phone.

703
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:38,914
It took me three hours
before I could get it
to move an inch.

704
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:41,016
I wanted to start small.

705
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,053
Don't worry.
Once you're awakened,

706
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:47,189
you'll be able to do
so much more.

707
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,897
Sure nothing's
bothering you?

708
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:58,634
No. Everything's been great.

709
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:01,270
Good. Glad to hear.

710
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:05,207
What was it like...
to be awakened?

711
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:07,676
It's like you've been
sleeping your whole life,

712
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:11,747
and suddenly instead
of just dreaming,

713
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:14,116
everything is bright
and vivid,

714
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:16,618
and you have control
over all of it.

715
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,923
And how'd you find out
that you were, uh, special?

716
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,993
When I was a freshman,

717
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:28,297
there was a girl on
the lacrosse team with me.

718
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:31,166
She saw how fast I was.

719
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:35,170
I was a top scorer,
and I'd only been on
the team a couple of weeks.

720
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:38,173
So one night, she invited me
to a Circle meeting.

721
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,976
But when you're like us,
part of you always knows.

722
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:44,680
Just like I'm sure
part of you always felt
that something was missing,

723
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:45,914
that something wasn't...

724
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:46,949
Quite right?

725
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:51,053
So you did feel it.

726
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,055
Yeah.

727
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,124
And now?

728
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,631
It feels, uh, different.

729
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,633
Better?

730
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:06,335
Like I belong.

731
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:08,370
That's because you do.

732
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,876
[bell tolling]

733
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,687
Hey, where's Jonah?

734
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:28,090
Reiko was asked
to keep him company.
Oh, yeah?

735
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:31,727
This is a secret meeting.
The Great Witch wishes to speak.

736
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:53,782
We are here, Great One.
Speak to us.

737
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:58,253
My children, foreseen
a great disturbance, I have.

738
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:02,724
The witch slayers have once
again returned to these woods.

739
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:05,327
The twins are scions
of the Grimms,

740
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,263
the brother and sister
of prophecy are they.

741
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:11,366
Jonah's no witch slayer.
I recruited him myself.

742
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:14,703
And yet, flow through
his veins their blood does.

743
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:18,306
Blinded are you
by his potential.

744
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:22,310
The question is,
which path will the heir choose?

745
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:25,280
Look, we offer him greatness.

746
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:27,149
He'd be an idiot
to deny the us.

747
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:29,051
And you are convinced of this?

748
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:30,185
Yeah.

749
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:33,221
Then your responsibility
he shall be.

750
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:35,957
If they do not join us...

751
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,334
...they must be sacrificed.

752
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:19,000
Hey, buddy. Heard you had
a good time last night.

753
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:23,004
Huh? Hey, don't be shy, man.
What happened?

754
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:25,807
Hmm? Yeah,
I knew it, buddy.

755
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,245
What about you?
What'd you do last night?

756
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,782
Nothing.
Just studying.

757
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:36,084
Wasn't sure you guys
you actually did that.

758
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,286
Well, we do have to graduate,
you know.

759
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:41,156
So, um, listen.

760
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:45,393
We've been talking,
and we think it's your turn.

761
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,863
My turn?

762
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:49,898
Yeah, you know,
to be awakened.

763
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,266
[hums fanfare]

764
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,001
Really?
Yeah.

765
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:55,237
Unless you don't think
you're ready.

766
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:59,007
No-- I mean, of course, yeah.

767
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:02,144
Yeah? See you tonight then?

768
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:04,479
Sure.

769
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:07,315
Good. Pssshh!

770
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,869
Well, well.

771
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,271
I don't want any trouble.

772
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:32,040
We need to talk.
Later. I'm late for class.

773
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:35,177
I think we'll talk now.
Inside!

774
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,250
Nice room.

775
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:44,920
It was so depressing
when Kristen lived here.

776
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:47,422
All work and no play.

777
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:49,858
Did you actually
read her writing?

778
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,359
Total buzz kill.

779
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,561
What did you do to her?

780
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:54,329
I didn't say you could talk.

781
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,132
Now, a little birdie told me

782
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:59,301
you think
you're a witch slayer.

783
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,136
You killed her, didn't you?

784
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:03,572
Do you really think
you're strong enough

785
01:04:03,574 --> 01:04:06,241
to take us on all alone?

786
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:08,043
Who says I'm alone?

787
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:11,413
Maybe this school is full of
witch slayers just waiting.

788
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:14,316
We've been watching.

789
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:16,384
You're the only one.

790
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,357
You're not going
to get away with this.

791
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,427
Yes, we are.

792
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:30,265
You think just because
your parents were witch slayers
you're so strong?

793
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:34,236
So powerful? Huh?

794
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:36,538
I'm gonna give you
a shot to prove it.

795
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:40,308
Go ahead. Slay me.

796
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,980
Is that the best you can do?

797
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:46,648
Let me tell you
what's gonna  happen.

798
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,284
First thing,
I'm gonna kill you.

799
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:50,886
Right here.

800
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,888
Then I'm gonna bring your body
to your brother

801
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:56,291
and make sure he sees what I did
before we kill him, too.

802
01:04:56,293 --> 01:05:00,662
Then we're gonna burn you both.

803
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,964
Just like they did
to your parents.

804
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:04,633
They were weak...

805
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:06,668
just like you.

806
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,537
[groans]

807
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,243
Now, that's the best
I can do.

808
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:45,941
Ella. Ella, wait.

809
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,679
I know what you're up to.
Stay back.

810
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:53,515
I don't think you do.

811
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:57,085
I think it's time
we had a little chat.

812
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:14,035
We've waited a long time
for your arrival.

813
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:16,604
Once there were dozens.

814
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:19,274
Now I'm the only one left.

815
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:22,243
If The Circle I knew
I was a witch slayer,

816
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,279
they would've
killed me years ago.

817
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:26,648
How long has the Great Witch
been out there?

818
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,450
Since before
the school was built.

819
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:31,653
Since before our ancestors
landed in Plymouth.

820
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,089
And she can
really be stopped?

821
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:36,691
Not alone.
According to the book,

822
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:41,296
only twin descendants
of the family Grimm
possesses the ability.

823
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:43,198
Well, that's not gonna happen.

824
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,499
Why is that?

825
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,668
My brother's one of them.

826
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:50,038
Don't worry.
He can fraternize with them.

827
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,241
He can attend their rituals,
but in his heart,

828
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:55,343
he will never
truly be one of them.

829
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,113
So they may try to hurt him.

830
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:01,716
Yeah, which is why
I need to train you,
so we can protect him.

831
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:06,654
So what, is there like
books or videos or maybe--

832
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,259
We don't have time for books.

833
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,329
<i>En garde.</i>

834
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,666
Ah, you truly are
your mother's daughter.

835
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:20,035
How about a warning next time?

836
01:07:20,037 --> 01:07:21,169
I did.

837
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,470
That was a crappy warning.

838
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,172
What, do you think
they're gonna warn you?

839
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,608
They're never gonna warn you!

840
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:30,445
I was just saying maybe
you can be a little nicer
about it, that's all.

841
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:34,749
Okay. Pretty please
with sugar on top.

842
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,418
En garde.

843
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,595
Okay.

844
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:50,231
Let's work on
your reflexes.

845
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:12,754
So, Mr. Sebastian
is a witch slayer.

846
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,756
Looks like it.

847
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,758
I never liked him.

848
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,760
You know what to do.

849
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,695
Yes, ma'am.

850
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,201
The important thing is
you must be ready
when the time comes.

851
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,337
How'd my parents die?

852
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,775
After graduation,

853
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:37,212
your mom was pregnant,
so they moved away,

854
01:08:37,214 --> 01:08:39,581
and that's when they had
you and your brother.

855
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,449
But word had gotten out that
the Witch was growing stronger.

856
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,219
After years of lying dormant,
she was building an army,

857
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:45,487
getting ready to strike.

858
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:46,821
So they came back.

859
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:49,624
So yes, they came back,
but they were betrayed.

860
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:53,128
An old classmate of theirs,
she lured them into the woods,

861
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,230
she said she wanted
to be a slayer,

862
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:59,167
that she needed to know
how to fight witches.

863
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:00,435
Who was it?

864
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:02,504
Her name was Cassandra Keegan.

865
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,907
Ms. Keegan,
the guidance counselor?

866
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:10,311
The powers of evil
does not play by the rules.

867
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:15,250
If you truly want
to be safe-- truly--

868
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:16,784
you can trust no one.

869
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:18,653
And my brother?

870
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:22,257
He said he could never
be one of them.

871
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:25,460
I never said
you could trust him.

872
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,464
Run! Run!

873
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:30,798
Going somewhere?

874
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,634
This is for Megan.

875
01:09:32,636 --> 01:09:34,435
[stab]

876
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,348
Bring forth the sacrifice.

877
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,720
Ella.

878
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,489
Jonah! Jonah, please.

879
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,857
Silence!

880
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,392
Hey, what's going on?

881
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,962
She needs our help
to cross over, Jonah.

882
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:34,996
Don't you want to help her?

883
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:37,899
Yeah, but--
Hey, Jonah.

884
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,868
What's the problem, man?

885
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:43,238
I thought you wanted
to be awakened.

886
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,607
Her soul is going
to a better place.

887
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:48,243
A happier place.

888
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:49,877
You need to do this.

889
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,546
Do it, Jonah.

890
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,315
Do it.

891
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,891
To the Great Witch
of the Woods,

892
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:05,593
we bring you a soul
to protect!

893
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,295
[thunderclap]

894
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:13,901
Kill her, Jonah!

895
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,505
I don't want to fight you.

896
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:20,008
You're one of us.
Now kill her!

897
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,981
Mr. Sebastian
has taught you well,

898
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:28,583
but it was not enough
to save him,

899
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:30,885
and it will not
be enough to save you.

900
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:35,790
Jonah, we're supposed
to be on the same side.

901
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,859
Don't listen to her!

902
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,703
The Circle
doesn't help anyone.

903
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:50,938
You're not helping anyone
cross over.

904
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,574
You're sacrificing them
to the Witch of the Woods.

905
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,376
You're lying!

906
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:57,645
Now finish her!

907
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:04,052
Jonah... please.

908
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:13,328
No. I can't do it.

909
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,565
Very well. Kill them both.

910
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:18,900
Are you ready?

911
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,471
You have no idea
what you've given up.

912
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,740
I think I'll
take that chance.

913
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:27,775
I can't hit a girl.
But I can.

914
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,919
I knew it was a mistake
bringing you into this.

915
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:39,387
You heard what she said.

916
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:40,988
The Circle
isn't about doing good.

917
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:43,558
You had so much potential,
and you threw it away.

918
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,395
Landon, we can use our potential
to do some real good.

919
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:50,832
Oh, I plan on it.

920
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:54,435
Pity.

921
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,041
Leave my brother alone.

922
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,411
Oh, you're in
way over your head.

923
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:04,579
No. You are.

924
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,651
That's impossible!
No one can do that.

925
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:12,754
A witch slayer can.

926
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,159
Jonah, you okay?

927
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,430
Yeah. She's getting away.
Come on.

928
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,537
I'm really sorry that
I didn't listen to you.

929
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:32,707
I don't know about you,
but I think it's time she pays
for what she did to the school.

930
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:33,975
And our parents.

931
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:38,112
Boo! The Great Witch
has been expecting you.

932
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,113
There she is.

933
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:40,882
I'm everywhere.

934
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:42,817
Don't you get it?
She's the Great Witch.

935
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,719
It's been her all along.

936
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:46,621
Clever boy.

937
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:49,424
A shame things didn't
work out between us.

938
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:52,193
You would've made
a formidable ally.

939
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:55,463
For centuries I've lived here,
preying on the weak.

940
01:13:55,465 --> 01:13:59,133
Finally I decided
why not expand my resources?

941
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:01,602
So you had Benjamin Corey
build the school.

942
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:04,138
And now my disciples
are everywhere.

943
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,575
One day the pitiful people
of this world

944
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:10,845
will wake up and realize
who's calling the shots.

945
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:15,750
All I ask in return is
a little nourishment.

946
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:20,688
Hmm... I can't decide
which of you to eat first.

947
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:25,526
I've always been partial
to boys, but Ella looks
particularly delicious.

948
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:29,597
Your parents were tasty, too.

949
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,703
I can't wait to sink
my teeth into you.

950
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:38,606
I've got something
to sink into you.

951
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,741
[screaming]

952
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:55,156
Our parents.

953
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,614
Hey, how'd we get here?

954
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:23,251
Hey, who are you guys?

955
01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:26,254
Think they'll ever remember?
I hope not.

956
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:40,101
All packed?

957
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:41,602
Almost done.

958
01:15:41,604 --> 01:15:43,938
You sure about this?

959
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:46,240
Well, like
the Great Witch said,

960
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:49,610
this school
gives a lot of rise
to some powerful witches.

961
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:51,178
Someone's gotta slay 'em.

962
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,681
There's a lot of pages
left to fill.

963
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:56,717
I wonder what Adam and Allyson
would say about this.

964
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,887
I know, but Mom and Dad
would've wanted it.

965
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,889
Ah.

966
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,257
Oh.

967
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,926
What's this?
I don't know.

968
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:07,762
Looks like someone
left you a note.

969
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,734
It's from Mr. Sebastian.

970
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,970
Says, "Ella, hopefully
everything has gone well..."

971
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:18,573
<i>[Mr. Sebastian]</i>
<i>"...and according to plan.</i>

972
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:22,643
<i>Inside this envelope,</i>
<i>you will find something</i>
<i>your parents left behind,</i>

973
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:26,147
<i>something I'm sure</i>
<i>they would've wanted</i>
<i>you and Jonah to have.</i>

974
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:29,784
<i>Hopefully we will meet again</i>
<i>in another life.</i>

975
01:16:29,786 --> 01:16:31,886
<i>Fondly, Mr. Sebastian."</i>

976
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,188
What is it?

977
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,659
It's our original
birth certificate.

978
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:39,894
No way!

979
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:42,830
Yeah.

980
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,868
Look! Our real names.

981
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,604
You know what?

982
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:51,606
What are you doing?

983
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:53,608
Signing our real names.

984
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:03,050
Well, Gretel?

985
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,852
Yes, Hansel?

986
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:07,054
