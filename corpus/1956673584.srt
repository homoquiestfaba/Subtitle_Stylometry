1
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,867
My name is Geralyn Lucas.

2
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,549
I came to New York with a plan.

3
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,679
I always had a plan.

4
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,601
I made lists...
Well, not wishlists.

5
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,560
Wishlists depend
on hope and luck

6
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,780
and for stars in the night sky.

7
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,131
I made a list of all
the things I wanted,

8
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,829
and then I worked
hard until I got them.

9
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,049
Get married, have a career,
raise children, give

10
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,138
back to society,
all while having

11
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,009
the guts to wear red lipstick.

12
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:12,420
I love red lipstick
because it's a choice.

13
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,248
Wearing it shows
confidence, demands

14
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:17,686
that the world pay attention,
and dares you to live up to it.

15
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:24,084
But I wasn't that daring yet.

16
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:29,915
A few years ago, my list
was almost complete.

17
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,222
I married Tyler Lucas,
a handsome doctor

18
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:34,224
who could easily
pass for Tom Cruise,

19
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:38,881
if Tom were taller, more
highlyeducated, and much less weird.

20
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,232
I was a story editor for
"2020," the top TV news magazine

21
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,191
show with Barbara Walters.

22
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,845
So, the husband and
jobthings were under control,

23
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,196
and children were on
the immediate horizon.

24
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,762
I swear to God,
in the dictionary,

25
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:53,287
under having it all
was a picture of me.

26
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,941
Well, me if I weresmarter, taller, and more

27
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:58,596
self-confident, and had a dog.

28
00:01:58,727 --> 00:01:59,510
Evening, Ms. Lucas.

29
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:01,773
Evening, Joe.

30
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:03,688
Taxi!

31
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:04,819
Taxi!

32
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:09,606
Taxi!

33
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,177
46th and 8th please.

34
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:15,308
Sure.

35
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,898
- I
- wasn'treally a red lipstick girl.

36
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:22,098
I was really more
of a gloss girl.

37
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,621
Gloss is safe.

38
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,632
I felt like the women
whowore red lipstick were

39
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:30,280
more deserving than me,
more powerful than me.

40
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:33,979
But they aren't facing thelife
and death decision I am.

41
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,479
I need to go to a
place that will give me

42
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:38,201
clarity and insight, a
place that represents

43
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,637
everything I have to lose.

44
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,386
You work here?

45
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,822
No.

46
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:53,695
Well, maybe... Well, I
could if I wanted to.

47
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:54,652
Why do you ask?

48
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,263
No reason.

49
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,393
Thank you.

50
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:06,447
Breasts, boobs, tits, jugs.

51
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,666
Men have fought
and died for them.

52
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:10,625
Yes, died for them,
just so that they

53
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,105
can bury their heads in them.

54
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,375
What men don't know
is that they're hard

55
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,159
wired to make
idiots of themselves

56
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,032
over them, because breasts area
symbol of a woman's fertility.

57
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,774
So they sneak peeks at them,
look at pictures of them,

58
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:33,125
talk about them, grab and
touchthem, and pay to see them.

59
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:44,485
This place was a potpourriof
breasts on parade...

60
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:48,184
Big ones, bigger ones,
and Baywatch fake ones,

61
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,404
a crash course
like a CliffsNotes

62
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:53,537
on why boobs matter so much.

63
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,104
Get you something to drink?

64
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,975
Isn't it weird how
women have the power

65
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:59,500
to hypnotize men into
this, like, trance

66
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,242
just by taking off their tops?

67
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,156
Yeah, it's weird.

68
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:05,157
I'll have a beer.

69
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,508
Just a beer, in the bottle.

70
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:08,813
No glass, please.

71
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,359
I'dcome here to decide whether

72
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:17,648
or not to have a mastectomy,
to have my breasts cut off.

73
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,694
This decision could
very well save my life,

74
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:23,132
so why was it so hard to make?

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,110
Tell me you're going tocut
off some of my thigh,

76
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,440
I can live with that.

77
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,290
But don't tell me I've
got to lose a breast.

78
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,451
But what did it mean, really?

79
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,975
I mean, losing my breastwouldn't
mean losing my husband

80
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:42,456
or my job or my friends.

81
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,226
Or maybe that's exactly
what it will mean,

82
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,938
and I'll lose everything.

83
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,071
Am I willing to lose
the power these women

84
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:52,248
have in order to save my life?

85
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,206
10 days ago, I had what
felt like other very

86
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,818
important decisions to make.

87
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:59,603
I'll have the decaf nonfat
extrahot mocha with whipped cream,

88
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,015
but only if it's
non-fat whipped cream.

89
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,234
It's not just steam
milk extra foamy.

90
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:03,258
Please.

91
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,003
Hey, Geralyn, honey.

92
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,353
You've got to getyourself a lottery ticket.

93
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:11,833
This could be your lucky day.

94
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,071
Yeah, I believe inworking for your success,

95
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,357
not scratching for it.

96
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,185
Ooh.

97
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,467
Hi, it's Geralyn Lucas again.

98
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,970
Sorry.

99
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,470
OK, so what you're tryingto
achieve through surgery

100
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:21,775
is to look like Barbie...
Like the actual doll

101
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,410
or like a metaphor of some kind?

102
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,151
I'm sorry, can you hold
on one second please?

103
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:27,651
I'm sure you already
know this, sir,

104
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,355
but there's a shelter
over on 45th and 1st.

105
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,245
Go get yourself a shower,
havea hot meal, or buy alcohol,

106
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:34,484
if that's what you
need right now.

107
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,074
No judgments.

108
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,729
OK, so you've already had thebutt
lift, the tummy tuck,

109
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,862
the cheek and the dental
implants, the nose job,

110
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,672
but you're still going
to get the boob job.

111
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,086
Sir.

112
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:52,961
So is there a Ken or a
GIJoe you're doing this for?

113
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:55,659
I feel like we've covered
thewhole fat free, carb free diet

114
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,357
myth, at least for the moment.

115
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,010
What about teenagers
and oral sex?

116
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:00,901
They don't think it's sexbecause
there's no intercourse.

117
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,754
I swear, I saw thatLifetime
movie just last week.

118
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,125
I need something
thatwill move people, something

119
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,716
more edgy, human
interest stories that

120
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,718
make people feel something.

121
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,329
Like Gail's story about
spermdonor kids who want to meet

122
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,765
their dads, that was good.

123
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:17,768
That's what I'm talking about.

124
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,249
People.

125
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,380
Anybody.

126
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:22,773
Somebody.

127
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:23,924
It was my boss, Meredith.

128
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,123
I call her the goddess.

129
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:27,648
A celebrity baby picture bounty?

130
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:28,866
Yeah?

131
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,303
Um, soft addictions?

132
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,914
Like?

133
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,805
Dark chocolate, nail biting,
video gaming, shopping,

134
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,526
internet chat
rooms, online poker.

135
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:37,721
I mean, these
aren't, like, check

136
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,311
into treatment addictions.

137
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,941
You don't have to go througha
12-step program for them,

138
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:43,011
so maybe it'll be somethinga
little bit different.

139
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,448
Yeah, definite potential.

140
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,712
There's this one woman in Texas

141
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,975
who had 36 plastic
surgeries in order

142
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,518
to look like a Barbie doll.

143
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:53,542
Wow.

144
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:58,374
Like Barbie, like the doll.

145
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,723
Addicted to plastic surgery.

146
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:01,072
That's the promo.

147
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:02,552
Good work, Gail.

148
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:03,834
So then Meredith, the queen

149
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,860
of everything I
want to be in life,

150
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,255
gives me this big thumbs upand says to
me, I like that.

151
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,266
And then Victor,
the bossof the whole division,

152
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:14,956
says, good work, Gail, again.

153
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,305
Who's Gail?

154
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,654
Me.

155
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,371
That's what Victor
thinks my name is.

156
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,938
It was the first timehe's
ever complimented me.

157
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:23,094
I didn't want to ruin
it by correcting him.

158
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,724
When he hates something
I do, then I'll

159
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,447
tell him my real name,
and we can all hate Gail.

160
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:28,883
You're looking good.

161
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,015
Do you have a date
after work today?

162
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:32,843
Come on.

163
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,342
If I had a date, don't you
thinkthat would be the first thing

164
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,455
out of my mouth?

165
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,718
Nothing new happened
to me this week.

166
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,168
I could make
something up for you,

167
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:40,677
but that would just be pathetic.

168
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:41,939
OK, let's order dessert.

169
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,463
My god, is something wrong?

170
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,160
No.

171
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,530
Can't we have chocolate
withoutone of us being in crisis?

172
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:50,295
Not during the day.

173
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:51,688
OK.

174
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,561
Um, next time I go to
Dr. Crone's office,

175
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,346
I'm going to tell her
it'stime to go off the pill.

176
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,477
No way.

177
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:02,438
This is so exciting.

178
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,179
And scary.

179
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:05,833
Are we old enough
to be the parents?

180
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:08,052
Because I'm not ready
to make that commitment.

181
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:10,402
Tyler and you are creating life,

182
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,405
and I can't even meet somebody.

183
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:14,929
I'm a loser.

184
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,234
I'm not pregnant yet.

185
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,453
Well, is it on the list?

186
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,865
If it's on the list,
it will happen.

187
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,761
A list is just a guideline.

188
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,371
I've seen the list, Ger.

189
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,870
I saw the first one
when we were eight.

190
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:24,894
I've seen many since.

191
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:25,722
Let me see.

192
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:26,853
Grow large breasts.

193
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:27,897
Get straight A's.

194
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,136
Be editor of the school paper.

195
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,380
Columbia School of Journalism.

196
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,511
Marry a cool doctor.

197
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:33,817
Get a cool job.

198
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,665
Blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah.

199
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,561
So clearly the largebreast
thing didn't work out.

200
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:39,997
Yeah!

201
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:41,869
Blondie, what you doing tonight?

202
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,740
Look at these guys
checking you out.

203
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,394
Yeah, you.

204
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,830
I'm sorry.

205
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,180
All men are disgusting,
drooling pigs!

206
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,487
Why can't I find one to love me?

207
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,101
Hey, the movie starts
at 8:00, and I told them we'd

208
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,298
meet them for a drink before.

209
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,105
OK, two minutes.

210
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:02,585
OK.

211
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:03,780
Wait, wait, wait, we got
two minutes real time,

212
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:04,587
two minutes Geralyn time?

213
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,547
OK, six.

214
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:08,896
You know what?

215
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,177
I'm the one that's
going to have to make

216
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:10,985
the excuse why we're late.- Go.

217
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,203
Go away.
- Fine.

218
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:13,334
Hurry.

219
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,182
I just found threelumps in my right breast.

220
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:35,096
What?

221
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,010
Let me see.

222
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,838
Right here.

223
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,666
Honey, I'm sure it's nothing.

224
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:40,796
Come on.

225
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,001
How do you know it's nothing?

226
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,419
Because I'm a card
carrying doctor.

227
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:44,932
I have a stethoscope
and everything.

228
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:46,150
All right?
Let's go.

229
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,239
You're an orthopedic surgeon.

230
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,608
It's not like I felt
a lump in my knee.

231
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,155
Honey, do you remember?

232
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:53,003
When I was a resident,
I dida six-month breast cancer

233
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,178
rotation, and one
thing you learn

234
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,073
is it's almost always nothing.

235
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:57,616
It's like the time when
you had a headache,

236
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,960
you thought you
had a brain tumor,

237
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,663
or... or when you thought
you had pneumonia.

238
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,253
I'm not a hypochondriac.

239
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,840
Or how about the time youthought
you had a broken foot?

240
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:06,214
That was a really
rough pedicure.

241
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,519
OK?

242
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,019
I mean, you're the
one who taught me

243
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,063
how to do a self breast
exam in the first place

244
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,219
on our second date.

245
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:12,873
I just wanted to see you naked.

246
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:13,874
Come on, stop worrying.

247
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,049
Just hurry up.

248
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,287
Honey, I'm sure it's nothing.

249
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:17,051
I mean, you know what?

250
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,008
Women are lumpy.

251
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:18,922
Great.

252
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,750
Listen.

253
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,510
If it's still there in a weekor
so after you get your period,

254
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:23,884
we'll have it checked out.

255
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,513
You know when I'm
going to get my period?

256
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,537
Yeah.

257
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,715
Well, it doesn't take a genius.

258
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,685
Usually eating a carton
of Rocky Road ice cream

259
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,023
and complaining about being fat.

260
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:34,154
Do not.

261
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:37,027
And it's not always Rocky Road.

262
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,158
What is it?

263
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,469
See, now we're going to be late.

264
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,995
I don't think a few minuteswill
make a big difference.

265
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,346
A few minutes in real timeor
a few minutes in Tyler time?

266
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:54,305
We've been married
for two years,

267
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:57,221
and I've wanted a babysince
I was a little girl.

268
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:59,528
And Tyler wants kids
just as much as I do.

269
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,226
Put your other arm up.

270
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,533
You've been on the
pill for a long time,

271
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,230
so it might take
you a few cycles

272
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,536
before you can get pregnant.

273
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,190
I know.

274
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,845
I did this story on this
onewoman who had been trying

275
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,760
to get pregnant for,
like, three years,

276
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,457
and then she finds
out that her husband

277
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,609
has been grinding a birthcontrol
pill into her coffee.

278
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:21,202
OK, I hadn't heard everything.

279
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,527
I'm going to write
you a prescription

280
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,944
for prenatal vitamins.

281
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:25,573
But be sure you take
themwith food because they

282
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:28,513
can make you nauseous.

283
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,125
Anything else?

284
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,604
Well, I...

285
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,655
I'm sure it's nothing,
but I did find three lumps

286
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,173
in my right breast last week.

287
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:37,934
But two of them went away
after my period, so...

288
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,350
I didn't feel it.

289
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,049
It's kind of, like,
undermy arm, like right here,

290
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,896
kind of like deep under my arm...
Here, show me.

291
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,000
In my armpit right there.

292
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:48,403
I mean, it's probably fine, but.

293
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,535
Yeah, I feel it now.

294
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,841
You?

295
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,625
Yeah.

296
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,865
Tyler says it's nothing,
andhe thinks I'm a hypochondriac.

297
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:56,977
Well, he's right...

298
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,587
Not about you being
a hypochondriac,

299
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,284
but about it probably
being nothing.

300
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:01,415
You're young.

301
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:02,939
You've got no family history.

302
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,159
Not that that's
always an indicator.

303
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,074
I don't like to mess
around with lumps,

304
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:10,555
so I'm going to send you
for a mammogram today.

305
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,403
I have a really importantstaff
meeting at 3:00.

306
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:13,820
Can it wait?

307
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,275
I mean, keep in mindthat
every single disease

308
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,842
I've ever thought I
have had I didn't have.

309
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:17,649
Don't worry.

310
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,347
It's just a precaution.

311
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,677
The mammogram will just giveus
some useful information.

312
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,511
OK, just lower the
right side of your gown.

313
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,930
OK, now I need you to lean
inand put your left hand here.

314
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,976
And then I'm going to put
yourbreast on the steel plate.

315
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,762
That is... yeah,
if thiswas for a penis, it would

316
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,415
be heated and play Sinatra.

317
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:46,417
So can you tell
something right away?

318
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,811
The films have to be
reviewedby a radiologist first.

319
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,857
We really can't say
anything until then.

320
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:53,642
You'll get a call
in a day or two.

321
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,773
How many minutes is that?

322
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:55,600
You're still young.

323
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,341
I'm sure you're fine.

324
00:12:57,472 --> 00:13:00,083
You're at least 10 years
youngerthan anyone we normally see.

325
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,174
OK, I need you to standstill
and hold your breath.

326
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,264
No, it's nothing.

327
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,135
Tyler says they just
haveto be careful because

328
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:08,918
of lawsuits and stuff.

329
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:09,876
I'm sure I'm fine.

330
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,312
Um, I gotta go.

331
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,942
I'm not supposed to be
on a cellphone in here.

332
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,097
No, he'll come.

333
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,490
I'm sure that's fine.

334
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,684
I'll call you as soon
as I know something.

335
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,579
OK.
Bye, mom.

336
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,363
Love you, too.

337
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:20,863
Do I need to sign anything or...

338
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,714
Can you wait a few minutes?

339
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,412
Yeah.
Why?

340
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,782
I thought we wouldn't
knowanything for a couple of days.

341
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:34,402
Did someone just suck all
ofthe oxygen out of the room?

342
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,908
The radiologist took
a look at your films

343
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,605
and wants you to
have an ultrasound.

344
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,520
Can you make a 3 o'clock
appointment today?

345
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,651
Should I be freaking out?

346
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:47,914
No.

347
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,872
It's just an ultrasound,
not a biopsy.

348
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,083
That's a good thing, right?

349
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:59,142
Um, can you page,
Dr. Tyler Lucas, please?

350
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,753
Yeah, tell him it's
the hypochondriac.

351
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,319
I'm Bob Bradley.

352
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,538
I work with Tyler.

353
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,801
He asked me to see
you right away.

354
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,692
Unfortunately,
theresults of your ultrasound

355
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,239
were inconclusive.

356
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,634
So a biopsy is really
theonly way to know for sure.

357
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,114
I understand you're
both nervous,

358
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:16,116
so I've arranged to
do this right away.

359
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,989
Please, have a seat.

360
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,644
What I'll do is I'll
make a small incision.

361
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,622
Pathology will have theresults
back to us later today,

362
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:25,753
and we can all stop worrying.

363
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:26,517
We?

364
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,171
You're worried, too?

365
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,583
Because I know that I'mworried,
but if you're worried,

366
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:30,758
maybe I should be a
little more worried.

367
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:31,958
I'm not worried.

368
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,916
Women have lumps and
cysts all the time.

369
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:34,874
Your age?

370
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,224
I'm sure it's not cancer.

371
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:38,616
Me, too.

372
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,009
Please.

373
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
Lie down.

374
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,887
So, you and Tyler are friends?

375
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:50,367
That's nice to havefriends
in the workplace.

376
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,109
It's, um... it makes the whole
thing more fun and less,

377
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,895
work ish.

378
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,244
I'm sorry.

379
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:58,934
Could someone please
tape my mouth shut?

380
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,163
Stop worrying.

381
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:04,531
You always think that
somethingterrible is going to happen,

382
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:05,555
and it never does.

383
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,083
Never, never, never, never.

384
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:12,912
Don't worry.

385
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,348
I'm not crazy.

386
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:17,090
I was just trying to be
optimistic in the face

387
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,874
of terrifying inescapable doom.

388
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,452
I'm afraid the news isn't good.

389
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:34,150
It's, it's cancer.

390
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,941
But we're going to doeverything
we can to beat this.

391
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,527
We have to wait for
the final pathology,

392
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:46,119
but I'm sure you're
acandidate for lumpectomy.

393
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,034
It's a small scar,
nothing to worry about,

394
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,732
and you'll be mostly unchanged.

395
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:54,344
Mostly unchanged?

396
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,780
Will I need chemo?

397
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:56,956
I mean, is all...

398
00:15:57,086 --> 00:16:00,133
All of my hair
going to fall out?

399
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:04,137
Is it wrong that that
was my first question?

400
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:10,273
And actually, my first
questionis, um, am I going to die?

401
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,456
It's all the coffee I drink.

402
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,850
Too much microwave,
allthose artificial sweeteners,

403
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,046
me taking the pill too long,
not taking the pill long enough.

404
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,549
It's not your fault.

405
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,856
Of course it's my fault.
All the red meat, hormones

406
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,640
in the milk, lead in the water.

407
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,165
I mean, all that secondhandsmoke
or firsthand cell phone.

408
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,688
Stop making yourself crazy.

409
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:35,385
I still eat those
maraschino cherries

410
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:37,716
even though I know they
havethat red dye that kills you.

411
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,911
What time's your ma
supposed to come?

412
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:40,869
Any minute.

413
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,175
Is your dad coming, too?

414
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:44,264
This is my family
we're talking about.

415
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,937
You sure you don'twant me to come with you?

416
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:47,591
Don't you have those two
surgeries this morning?

417
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,896
I'm not going to keep
two innocent people

418
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,120
from having their knees fixed.

419
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,232
Baby.

420
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:57,103
Hi, mom.

421
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,843
Aw.

422
00:16:58,974 --> 00:16:59,801
Hi, dad.

423
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,108
Hi, sweetheart.

424
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:03,239
Hey, Ger.

425
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,545
Hey, Adam.

426
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:05,696
You know the law
school's close, OK?

427
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,808
Hello, Tyler.

428
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:08,218
So I can totally
be here to help,

429
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,028
and if I have to drop
out for you, I will.

430
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:10,203
Drop out of law school?

431
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,856
No one's dropping
out of anything.

432
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:13,443
We're all here to
cover for each other.

433
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,922
We're all in this together.

434
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:15,730
Hey, Tyler.

435
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,427
Hey, Adam.

436
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:18,385
Hi.

437
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:19,255
It's the girls.

438
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,561
Hi, hi, hi.

439
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,345
I signed you up at
the market so you

440
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,497
call, tell them we're going
tobe here for whatever you need.

441
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,785
The point is, Ger,
you'renot in this fight alone.

442
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,874
We're going to be withyou
every step of the way.

443
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,138
OK, so, who's
going to go with you?

444
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,878
Going where?

445
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:35,291
I have an appointment withthis
oncologist this morning.

446
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,446
- Who?
- Dr. Murray.

447
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:37,621
Who is Dr. Murray?

448
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:38,492
Well, I did a rotation with her.

449
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:39,884
- Her?
- Yes, her.

450
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,451
She's very good.

451
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,125
She's, well,
women loveher because she's tough.

452
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,759
This is good?

453
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,544
She's a battle ax,
and youwant someone who's aggressive.

454
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,000
I see famous doctors

455
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,678
at famous clinics.

456
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:53,115
These are the Chanels,
theGuccis, the Pradas of cancer.

457
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,246
Hi.

458
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:02,864
I feel like I'm cheating
on my first doctor.

459
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:05,277
I mean, just because you're
asecond opinion and everything.

460
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,694
You're only 27?

461
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:07,651
Yeah.

462
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:10,741
This is unbelievable.

463
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:14,180
My god, you have
really bad luck.

464
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,530
My first doctor cried,
and my second doctor

465
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,792
told me I have bad luck.

466
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,228
I'm totally screwed.

467
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,710
We have a lot to talk about.

468
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,103
So I need a lumpectomy.

469
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,278
No.

470
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,715
You need a double mastectomy.

471
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,499
A double mastectomy?

472
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,911
Why hit something
with a feather when

473
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,285
you can hit it with a hammer?

474
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,896
Now, you have a lot to consider.

475
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:37,768
You can start chemo
beforesurgery and continue after,

476
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,379
or you can just start after.

477
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,207
We can spread it
out with lower doses

478
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,252
over a longer period
of time or get through

479
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:44,775
it faster with higher doses.

480
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:47,474
You might be a candidate
for a clinical trial

481
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:48,953
that I'm involved in.

482
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,607
You'd be receiving
much more powerful

483
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,567
drugs, drugs that aren'tyet
available to the public.

484
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:57,484
There is the risk of
heartfailure and early menopause,

485
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,094
but with that risk,
there's a higher

486
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:02,576
percent chance of a cure.

487
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,012
How much higher?

488
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,319
About a half a percent,
but it's your decision.

489
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:15,893
I think I want a
second, second opinion.

490
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:20,768
You're in luck.

491
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,987
My cancer patients tend
to have good outcomes.

492
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,555
I didn't realize how
manydoctors believe in luck.

493
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,992
Personally, I would recommenda
lumpectomy with radiation.

494
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,563
The last doctor I
went to see told me

495
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,146
that she thinks I shouldhave
a double mastectomy.

496
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,258
Can you believe that?

497
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,708
I mean, I have
cancer on one side,

498
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:34,801
and she thinks I should
take them both off.

499
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,392
Well, she may be right.

500
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,370
There are different
treatmentoptions available to you.

501
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:39,830
But it's really your decision.

502
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,243
There it is again...

503
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,703
My decision.

504
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,420
Like I have a clue,
likel'm deciding between a side

505
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,968
of coleslaw or potato salad.

506
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,318
There is a long-term studyout
of Italy that suggests

507
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:50,729
that women live
just as long with

508
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,756
a lumpectomy as a mastectomy.

509
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,386
I mean, you're such an
attractive young woman,

510
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,282
I'd hate to see you
lose your breast.

511
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,955
And I had to wonder,

512
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,024
did he hate to see me losemy
breast from a doctor's

513
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:01,678
or a man's point of view?

514
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,247
A lumpectomy would removethe entire
lump, as well as

515
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:07,902
the extra tissue around it,
justto make sure that the margins

516
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,034
are free of cancer cells.

517
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:12,776
Now you still needchemotherapy
and radiation,

518
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,692
but you'd be more, um...

519
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:16,650
Unchanged?

520
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,347
Yes, unchanged.

521
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:19,566
But it's...

522
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:20,436
It's your decision.

523
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,437
My decision, yes.

524
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:22,960
My decision, I know.

525
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:26,834
Um, what would you tellyour
mother or your sister

526
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:30,794
or your daughter to do?

527
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,840
Well, it's hard to say.

528
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,970
Well, can you try?

529
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,248
Sweetheart,
pick up yourhead and eat something.

530
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,589
You need your strength.

531
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,721
I don't want anyone to see me.

532
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,177
I don't think your
plan is working.

533
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,811
When she was a little girl, she

534
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,094
used to think that if she closedher
eyes, nobody could see her.

535
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,250
Didn't you, honey?

536
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,618
And what a beautiful
baby she was.

537
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,042
Remember, she walked
at nine months?

538
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:55,428
Do I remember?

539
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:56,429
- Of course I remember.
- You know what?

540
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,908
Maybe I should take her home.

541
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,910
I think she shouldstart a macrobiotic diet.

542
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,999
A woman I work with at
school changed her diet

543
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,000
and cured herself.

544
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,131
Of cancer?

545
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:05,175
High blood pressure.

546
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,961
But it works for
a lot of things.

547
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,504
There's another doctor
I want her to see.

548
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,790
Her?
I'm her.

549
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,532
Don't talk about her
like her's not here.

550
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:13,662
A seventh opinion?

551
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,752
No, she's a cancer therapist.

552
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:18,625
I've done some research,
and shecomes very highly recommended.

553
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,235
She's someone for
you to talk to,

554
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,039
you know, someone to helpyou
think things through.

555
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:25,109
Why would you think
I need to see a shrink?

556
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,894
Can I get you
guys anything else?

557
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,461
No, thank you.

558
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,680
Yes, I would like tosee
a dessert menu please.

559
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:32,291
I have cancer.

560
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,858
Um, the doctor gave
hersomething to calm her nerves.

561
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,991
I'm very calm.

562
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:40,124
Calm and cancerous.

563
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:41,648
OK.

564
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,650
Philadelphia's so far away.

565
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,454
Harvey and I would liketo
come and stay with you

566
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:46,498
and help you look after Geralyn.

567
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:47,349
I don't...

568
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,785
I don't know.

569
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,459
I don't... I don't think
that's a very good idea.

570
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:51,266
We can sleep on the floor.

571
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:52,180
It's not a problem.

572
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,660
It's not a problem.

573
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,096
You guys...

574
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,769
I don't think I can be
away from her right now.

575
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,795
Ger?

576
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:01,407
Ger.

577
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:02,756
So what's going on with you?

578
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:03,670
I'm good.

579
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Thank you.

580
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,499
How are you?

581
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:08,564
Maybe there's
somethings you want to talk about?

582
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:10,807
Like what?

583
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:14,376
Right, I'm here because
I'mstressed out about my cancer.

584
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:17,553
And I am, of course,
concerned about it,

585
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,338
but that's to be
expected, right?

586
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:22,906
I mean, I'm just normal,
the normal level of concern.

587
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,647
Well, maybe there's some things

588
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,930
that you need to say out
loudthat you can't say in front

589
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,172
of your family and friends.

590
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,871
No, my family and
friends are wonderful.

591
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:36,877
I say lots of things
to them out loud.

592
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:38,922
You must be very scared.

593
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,011
I used to be scared
of cockroaches,

594
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,753
of algebra, sharks.

595
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:47,583
Not having makeup on whenl
run into an old boyfriend

596
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,518
on the street,
who I don'treally even care about,

597
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:53,763
but he dumped me,
so... althoughl was going to dump him.

598
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:56,026
I'm scared that I'll
make the wrong decision.

599
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,517
I'm scared that I can make
theright decision and still die.

600
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:04,208
I'm scared that if I go tosleep at
night, I won't wake up.

601
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:11,302
And I'm scared that
my husband secretly

602
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:16,177
thinks that he picked wrongand
that I'm damaged goods.

603
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:23,750
And that deep down,
he wishesthat he could run away.

604
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,151
I saw you from three
blocks away?

605
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,936
Wow.

606
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,287
I almost crashed intothat
car trying to pick you up.

607
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,744
I thought you were just a
baddriver like most other caddies.

608
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,073
Me?
No, no, no.

609
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:45,685
I'm a really gooddriver...
good dancer, too.

610
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:46,686
You like to dance?

611
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:47,687
No.

612
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:48,817
Really?

613
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,344
Well, you look
like you can move.

614
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,781
You know what?

615
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:57,697
Dancing can free your
life of boring limits.

616
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:58,567
It can lift you up.

617
00:23:58,698 --> 00:23:59,481
Choo!

618
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:00,961
Fly away.

619
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:03,311
You look like you coulduse
some lifting up, ooh.

620
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,576
Bad day, lady?

621
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,100
I love this song.

622
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,469
Come on, sing with
me on this one?

623
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,016
You know the words?

624
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:18,108
Come on, sing.

625
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:24,114
Hey, lady, you OK?

626
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,072
I'm fine.

627
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:25,986
You sure?

628
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,683
Please, just drive.

629
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:29,356
Come on, there must be
something I can do?

630
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,991
Pull over, dance a little bit?

631
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:33,950
Actually, I won't be doingmuch
dancing because next week,

632
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:37,954
I'm having my right breastcut
off because I have cancer.

633
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:46,876
Tonight at 11:00,

634
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,662
"2020" loses one of theirown
when a crazy Cuban taxi

635
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:50,880
driver kills Gail.

636
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,887
Lady, lady, listen to me.

637
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:01,282
You and I were supposed
tomeet at this very moment.

638
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,327
It's what we Cubans call fate.

639
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,633
Fate comes from Cuba?

640
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,505
Yes.

641
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:10,247
I had testicular
cancer three years ago.

642
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,858
I was treated at
Sloan Kettering.

643
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:14,295
I had one ball removed.

644
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,123
I've been fine ever since.

645
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:18,560
And you would be, too.

646
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:19,518
I will.

647
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:20,693
Yes.

648
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:21,823
I am certain.

649
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,046
Thank you.

650
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:27,240
You know, I even dance
better with one ball.

651
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,264
Really?

652
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,092
It's true.

653
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,485
Yeah, everybody says so.

654
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:37,796
Can you take me home now?

655
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,259
Suddenly, an angel has appeared

656
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:48,721
to tell me that I can be whole.

657
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:51,550
I thought on the ride
homethat if a one-balled man

658
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,074
and an about to be
one-boobed woman

659
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,120
can end up connecting in
a seven minute cab ride

660
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,210
in a city of millions,
then somehow,

661
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:01,560
I will survive this ordeal.

662
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:17,663
Go home.

663
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:20,404
When I'm a wreck,
you can cover for me.

664
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:36,290
Yes, tell him it's Dr.Tyler
Lucas from Mount Sinai.

665
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,020
I'm calling about the
breast cancer study

666
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:40,207
he was doing with
women under 40.

667
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:41,730
Yes, I read his article.

668
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:44,428
It's just he doesn'tmention
anyone in their 20s.

669
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,691
None?

670
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,279
She snorted!

671
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,629
No, it's a genetic.
It is.

672
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,759
It's not.
It's...

673
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:12,847
My... my aunt.

674
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:14,043
It's how many glasses of wine.

675
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:16,678
That's what makes you snort.

676
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:17,809
Boy.

677
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,819
What... what are you doing here?

678
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,777
It's nice to see you, too.

679
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:30,170
No, I just...

680
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,887
I thought that you were
in surgery tonight.

681
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:33,913
No, I, couldn't.

682
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,524
I just... I didn't
want you to be alone.

683
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,197
I mean, you know, after
your brother went home,

684
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:41,050
and your parents went
to sleep, and your...

685
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:42,181
Your friends left.

686
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,385
Well, don't you worry, Tyler.

687
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:46,490
You don't have to
satisfy all of us.

688
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,144
Let's go for it.

689
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,407
I'm just going to
jump in the shower.

690
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:51,887
We'll be gone
before you get out.

691
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,018
Or not!

692
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,608
Will you guys still bemy
best friends when I die?

693
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,242
You're not going to die.

694
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:00,567
Well, if I do,
you can marry Tyler.

695
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:01,591
Thank you.

696
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:02,506
But you're not going to die.

697
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:03,637
Well...

698
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:08,599
Are you OK?

699
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,775
Just...

700
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,167
What?

701
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,256
Well, why don't you
want me to marry Tyler?

702
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,041
OK.

703
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:15,998
No, no, no, no, no.

704
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,652
She's drunk.

705
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,151
I am going to take her
homebefore she says something

706
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:20,481
even more ridiculously stupid.

707
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,019
Good.

708
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:39,282
You're awake.

709
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:40,283
What should I do?

710
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:41,502
Please tell me what to do.

711
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:42,895
I don't know.

712
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,133
I have all the same
information you have.

713
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:44,897
It's your body.

714
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:45,898
It's your decision.

715
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:47,160
Please don't tell me that.

716
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,311
I'm so sick and tired
of hearing that.

717
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:49,728
I'm not a doctor.

718
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,488
I'm not qualified to
makea decision like this.

719
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:52,837
I mean, I can't even
decidewhether or not to have a flu

720
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,123
shot.

721
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:55,864
All right.

722
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,537
Listen, every doctor I canpossibly
reach, I've spoken to.

723
00:28:57,561 --> 00:29:01,696
And some think that a
mastectomyis the safer way to go.

724
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:05,178
But then others think that
alumpectomy is the same thing.

725
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:09,356
And you don't run the
riskof losing your breast.

726
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:12,011
OK, I've decided.

727
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:18,582
Since it's my decision,
I want a lumpectomy.

728
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:20,233
You know how I love
to save everything.

729
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,412
I mean, I still have
my kindergarten report

730
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:24,153
card and all my baby teeth.

731
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:25,633
Yeah.

732
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,591
Come here.

733
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,506
And that's what we'll do.

734
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,944
All right?

735
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:34,860
What if after all
this I can't have kids?

736
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,992
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

737
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:38,840
I want the baby more
thananything in this world.

738
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:39,690
I know you do, too.

739
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,476
What if we can't?

740
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:43,956
We will.

741
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,740
Sleep now.

742
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:46,871
OK?

743
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,221
Great, you're awake.

744
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,398
I told you they were up.

745
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:53,008
Did you tell him
about the lumpectomy?

746
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:56,751
Um, we were just discussing it.

747
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:57,621
That's good.

748
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,101
Good.

749
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,272
We'll give them some time.

750
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:04,375
So you told them
before you told me?

751
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,716
No.
Um, sort of.

752
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:10,417
They were here, and
they're my parents.

753
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,941
And you told Wendy
and Donna, too.

754
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:16,423
Yes, I just needed
to hear it out loud.

755
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,033
How did it sound?

756
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:19,818
Good, I think.

757
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:20,688
No, good.

758
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,908
I'm... I don't know.

759
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,300
Tyler, I don't know.

760
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,607
Maybe I just need to
un-decide for a while.

761
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:28,478
Here.

762
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:29,653
Make a list.

763
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:30,805
- Of what?
- It's what you do.

764
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,395
I don't know.

765
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,417
I mean, you took three weeksto
research our dry cleaner.

766
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:35,877
You are a researcher.

767
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,052
Do the research.

768
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,023
Hi, this is Geralyn Lucas.

769
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:53,001
Um, I'm giving you a
copyof my pathology report.

770
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:57,072
I decided to take
control of my life.

771
00:30:58,682 --> 00:31:01,337
Sorry, I think I must
have the wrong number.

772
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:09,606
Hi, this is Geralyn
Lucascalling Barbara Stoddard.

773
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:12,131
She told you that I
was going to call.

774
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:16,091
What made you decide
tohave a double mastectomy?

775
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:17,222
Ooh.

776
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:23,858
Maggie, could you pull that
showwe did last year on that woman

777
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,361
with breast cancer
who went to Mexico

778
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:26,797
and got cured with herbs?

779
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,079
I thought it might be
good to do a follow-up

780
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,671
piece on where she is now.

781
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:31,801
What?

782
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,890
She died.

783
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:50,864
I'm 27.

784
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,311
I am so sorry, but I reallyneed
to talk to you right now.

785
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,010
There are not enoughstudies
about breast cancer

786
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,470
in women under the age of 30.

787
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,120
What we do know is
it's more aggressive

788
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,864
and it has a higher
rate of recurring.

789
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:36,017
I mean, I don't even qualify
forthat lumpectomy study in Italy

790
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,321
because none of
the women studied

791
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,000
were under the age
of 40, and my tumor

792
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:42,525
has an extensive
interductal component.

793
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:43,962
I want a mastectomy.

794
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:46,225
I know that it's the
most radical approach,

795
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:48,662
but it's the safest way to go.

796
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,621
And I'm telling you and
I'mgoing home to schedule it.

797
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:53,992
You're telling me before
youtell the pizza delivery guy?

798
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:57,410
You sound really confident.

799
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,760
I'm... I'm proud of you.

800
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,283
I'm proud of me, too.

801
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:09,813
Good morning, Joe.

802
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:12,816
I've decided to go
with a mastectomy.

803
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,267
Saying it out
loud helps her cope.

804
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:17,996
Call me.

805
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:19,214
OK, Joe.

806
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,825
Bye, now.

807
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:24,219
I'll have a soy chai latte.

808
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,284
I don't know if you're aware,
but I read this article

809
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,025
in Redbook that said
that in 18 soy studies,

810
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,398
they noticed 14%
different breast

811
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:31,879
cancer rates in
Caucasianwomen who ate tofu.

812
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,683
I mean, they also note
thatthe studies were flawed,

813
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,187
but maybe it can't hurt, right?

814
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,362
Hey, Geralyn.

815
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:37,885
You want to buy
a lottery ticket?

816
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,714
I got a feeling this
might be a lucky day.

817
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:42,672
Luck has nothing to do with it.

818
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:44,587
You make a decision,
and you stick to it.

819
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:49,070
I'm going with the mastectomy,
and I feel good about it.

820
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:50,071
Hey.

821
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:51,202
You have your health.

822
00:33:58,471 --> 00:33:59,211
Are you busy?

823
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,082
Can I talk to you?

824
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,432
My job is very
important to me, but I'm

825
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:04,844
going to need to take
a couple weeks off

826
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:05,868
for some personal time.

827
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,746
Look, I have worked
really hard here,

828
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,618
and I'm not just going
to crawl under a table

829
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:20,406
and curl up into a
ball and disappear.

830
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:21,536
So how does that sound?

831
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:22,781
Yeah, that sounds really good.

832
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:24,366
You know, it's your
personal business.

833
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:26,499
You don't have to
tell anyone anything.

834
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:27,804
Yeah, she can't fire you.

835
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:28,979
It's illegal, so.

836
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,131
You think she's
going to fire me?

837
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:30,677
- No!
- Well...

838
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:31,807
No!

839
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,680
Ger, don't even think like that.

840
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,942
Come on, honey.

841
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:35,812
Where's your libido,
your confidence?

842
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,640
Holding on by a thread.

843
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:40,513
I'm about to lose
mybreasts, my hair, my job,

844
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,558
and maybe my husband, so.

845
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:44,430
You know what you need?

846
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,650
You need some special attention.

847
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,043
Like a last hurrah?

848
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,611
New York style.

849
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,047
I'll give you my skirt.

850
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:55,093
This skirt is
way too short on me!

851
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:56,442
Where did you get this?

852
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,226
The cutie section
at Bloomingdale's.

853
00:34:58,357 --> 00:34:59,488
OK, OK.
It's 12 on the dot.

854
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,055
Let's go.- This is a terrible idea.

855
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,361
No, no!

856
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,860
It's a sure-thing
confidence booster.

857
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:04,667
Shoes, shoes!

858
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:05,668
You need these.

859
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:06,799
There's no way around it.

860
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:07,714
- You need these.
- Aah!

861
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:08,844
You look amazing.

862
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:14,938
Yeah!

863
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,940
Go, go, go, go.

864
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,466
It's hot.

865
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:21,945
It's hot.

866
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:22,946
Come on, let's go!

867
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:23,904
Come on.

868
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:24,905
Go, go, go.

869
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:26,035
Woo!

870
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,127
Woo!

871
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,005
Woo!

872
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,136
Woo!

873
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,139
You're beautiful, Geralyn!

874
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,864
- I
- haven'tlived my life hard enough.

875
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:54,717
I've never even gotten
a speeding ticket.

876
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:57,503
But I will not be reduced to
alab report or a bad cell type.

877
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:09,906
Hi, can I talk to
you for a second?

878
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:10,820
Sure.

879
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:12,213
Come in.

880
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:17,740
Um, my, job is
really important to me.

881
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:20,395
And I love learning from you,
and I love working for you.

882
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:22,373
And I absolutely hate the
ideaof even missing a day here,

883
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:25,661
but I need to take
some personal time.

884
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:26,792
OK.

885
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,885
OK.

886
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,103
Um, good.

887
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,234
Thank you.

888
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:42,702
I have cancer,
and I have adouble mastectomy on Friday.

889
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,339
I know I should have
told you sooner.

890
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,430
There's... there's no

891
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:59,086
etiquette book on what to
dowhen you get breast cancer.

892
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,217
Sit down.

893
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,572
I understand how you feel.

894
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:16,451
I know people say
that a lot, but,

895
00:37:16,582 --> 00:37:19,585
I really know how you feel.

896
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:26,418
Years ago, I had breast cancer.

897
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:29,072
And I had a mastectomy.

898
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:31,597
The goddess had cancer?

899
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:32,772
My god.

900
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:34,077
Did I say that out loud?

901
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:37,342
That's just what I
call you in my head.

902
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:47,308
You are in for the
fight of your life.

903
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,093
But Geralyn, you're strong.

904
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:51,660
I have been telling...

905
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,159
Telling complete strangers,
but I just don't want

906
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:54,881
to be the office cancer girl.

907
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,230
You didn't choose this.

908
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,493
It happened to you.

909
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:00,016
And you're going
to get rid of it.

910
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:04,543
Have you ever tried a mantra?

911
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,284
A what?

912
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:10,723
It's just something you sayto
yourself to give you focus.

913
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:15,641
I tell myself I'm like the sky.

914
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,207
Nothing can stick to me.

915
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,906
Air planes can fly through me.

916
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:22,125
Storms can roll past me.

917
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:25,172
But I'm still the sky.

918
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,827
It worked for me.

919
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:33,441
I just want to live and
be happy, have a baby,

920
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:35,356
grow really old.

921
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:38,011
And you will.

922
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:40,056
How do you know?

923
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:41,187
Because I'm the goddess.

924
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,063
I need proof.

925
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:48,543
None of us gets proof.

926
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:49,849
Proof is in the future.

927
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:54,854
And the future is not here yet.

928
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:56,856
Leap of faith.

929
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:59,815
That's all we can.

930
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:08,084
Time for a new list.

931
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:12,001
One, get real breasts removed,
and two, shop for new breasts.

932
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:13,544
This is one accessory
you don't skimp on.

933
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:14,937
This is when you throw
down the credit card

934
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,789
and say, give me the
Jimmy Choo boobs.

935
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:17,919
Hi, there.

936
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,496
They're not real.

937
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:29,671
Sorry?

938
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,107
You were looking at my breasts.

939
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:32,238
They're not real.

940
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,109
I...

941
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,633
No one can tell.

942
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,983
I can wear backless
dressesand spaghetti straps

943
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:40,813
for the first time in my life.

944
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,423
They look great.

945
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,599
I had my breasts andovaries
removed two years ago.

946
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,038
Keel is the best
boobreconstruction guy in the city.

947
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:50,605
How long have you had cancer?

948
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,564
I never had cancer.

949
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,175
But I tested positive
for the gene.

950
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:58,134
You had all of that
surgery just in case?

951
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:01,007
I felt like a walking time bomb.

952
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:04,663
My grandmother and my motherand
two of my aunts had it.

953
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:06,839
It seemed like it was
just a matter of time.

954
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:09,363
So I took control.

955
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:10,494
You want to see them?

956
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,544
Um, yes.

957
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:17,763
I show everyone.

958
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:23,333
Wow.

959
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:24,247
They look good.

960
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:25,161
They look great.

961
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:26,554
They feel natural, too.

962
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,122
You want to feel them?

963
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,337
Come on, come on, it's OK.

964
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:38,697
My husband loves
them as much as I do.

965
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:39,987
Hope he doesn't mind sharing.

966
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:46,966
Those are reconstructedbreasts
following a mastectomy.

967
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:49,838
It's a book of boob mug shots.

968
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:53,363
After Dr. Bradley removesthe
malignant breast tissue,

969
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:56,410
I insert a special implant
called an expander.

970
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,326
Like a place holder boob.

971
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,589
Yeah, exactly.

972
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,286
Where are the nipples?

973
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:06,159
We put those and the areolaon
after the reconstruction

974
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:07,073
is completed.

975
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:08,030
How?

976
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:10,163
With tattooing.

977
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:14,254
Most surgeons tattoo thenipple
skin in only one color.

978
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:17,300
But an areola is not
just one color, is it?

979
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:18,301
No.

980
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:20,086
No.

981
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:24,482
I make a Seurat nipple.

982
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,460
Thank
godl was forced to take an art

983
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,703
history class in college.

984
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:32,925
I make pointillisticnipples,
different shades

985
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,275
with dots of color.

986
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:36,405
I'm very good.

987
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:42,456
I never realized howdifferent
nipples could be.

988
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:43,457
Yeah, I know.

989
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:45,372
Mine aren't really brownish.

990
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,418
Actually, they're a
lot like hers, only

991
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,465
prettier and much less slutty.

992
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:54,947
I just want ones like
the ones I already have.

993
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:58,820
Of course you do.

994
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:00,082
Ger, can we see them?

995
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:11,050
God.

996
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,007
They are nice.

997
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:14,619
They're beautiful.

998
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:16,269
We're going to take
a picture of those.

999
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:18,710
No,
I'm nottaking a picture of my boobs.

1000
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,059
Yes!

1001
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:20,799
No, no, no, we all will.
- Absolutely not.

1002
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:22,452
Yeah!

1003
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,605
We all will so that we
canfinally look back to a time

1004
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:26,805
before we had saggy
old grandma boobs.

1005
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:28,720
I will never let that happen.

1006
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,461
Yes, well, that's what Kendrasaid
when she got pregnant, so.

1007
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,555
What?

1008
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,599
Nothing.

1009
00:42:39,644 --> 00:42:41,689
Are there any more cookies?

1010
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,039
What?

1011
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,825
Well, it's just...

1012
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:49,131
OK, Kendra called.

1013
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:51,873
She's having a baby shower.

1014
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,528
And she wanted to knowwhether
or not to invite you.

1015
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,878
And we just didn't thinkit
was a good time to bring

1016
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:59,751
up the whole thing 'cause...

1017
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:02,623
So you guys are just
going to leave me out

1018
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:03,948
of everything because I'm sick?

1019
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:07,715
No, no, no, honey.

1020
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:09,978
Guys, I want kids,
butif I have to wait, I will.

1021
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:12,459
I mean, it doesn't mean
thatl'm not happy for Kendra.

1022
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,504
Well, you're going to have kids.

1023
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:15,767
You have to.

1024
00:43:15,897 --> 00:43:17,297
Because if you
don't, our kids won't

1025
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,224
have your kids as
bestfriends, and they'll grow

1026
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:20,328
up and become drug addicts.

1027
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:23,426
OK, everybody, shirts off!

1028
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:25,341
We are all taking
pictures because we

1029
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:27,692
are strong women who
understand that we

1030
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,302
are not just sex objects, OK?

1031
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:32,261
We are intelligent,
beautiful, creative people!

1032
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:34,307
Who have drunk
just enough wine...

1033
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:35,569
No, we have not.

1034
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,352
To take pictures of our boobs.

1035
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:37,658
Yes, we have.

1036
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:38,659
We have not drunk enough wine.

1037
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:39,790
Yes, we have.
All right.

1038
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:40,966
Start undoing.
Start undoing.

1039
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:45,535
1, 2, 3!

1040
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:50,671
My god.

1041
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:51,953
It's OK because he's a doctor.

1042
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:52,717
True!

1043
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,588
So it's fine.

1044
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:55,937
Bob's a great surgeon.

1045
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:58,070
Yeah, he's a lousy golfer.

1046
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,395
That just means
he's a great surgeon

1047
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:01,639
because he's in surgery, right?

1048
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:02,814
You'll be fine.

1049
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:04,859
I know.

1050
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:08,210
You know, you made
the right decision.

1051
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:10,125
You promise to stay with me?

1052
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:12,737
Well, I have no choice.

1053
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:15,087
I'm completely in love with you.

1054
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:16,760
Yeah, that's why I asked
you to marry me, that

1055
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:18,873
and the whole other things.

1056
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:20,309
What other things?

1057
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,964
So we can have sex in
the middle of the day.

1058
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:24,775
We never have sex in
the middle of the day.

1059
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:26,620
I know, but we could.

1060
00:44:30,189 --> 00:44:31,277
Right before major surgery?

1061
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,278
Yeah.

1062
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:34,280
It's going to be great.

1063
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,570
And the time after surgeryis
going to be even greater.

1064
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,115
Guess who?

1065
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:44,245
Surprise!

1066
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:46,814
Ha ha ha.

1067
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:48,860
Surprise.

1068
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,645
We just want to
be with you tonight.

1069
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:53,125
Are you surprised, sweetheart?

1070
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:54,779
Come on, let's go upstairs.

1071
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:56,104
Good night, sweetheart.- Good night.

1072
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:57,528
- Love you, too.
- Mommy loves you.

1073
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:05,267
What's wrong?

1074
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:06,398
Nothing.

1075
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:12,927
I, called Dr. Crone today.

1076
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:15,103
Today, why?

1077
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:16,844
I read that you
could have an egg

1078
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:20,152
removed and frozen until
you'rewell enough to get pregnant.

1079
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:21,544
What did she say?

1080
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:23,174
That I'd have to take
hormones so it would

1081
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:25,766
cause the cancer to increase.

1082
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:27,812
So, we'll wait.

1083
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:38,736
If, um, I go into
early menopause,

1084
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:44,002
then we can still adopt, right?

1085
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:45,438
Well, I don't know.

1086
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:46,589
I mean, did you discuss
this with your parents

1087
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,702
and your friends today?

1088
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,051
No.

1089
00:45:50,182 --> 00:45:51,637
I haven't even talked
to them about it.

1090
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:55,535
I just wanted to
considerall of our options.

1091
00:45:55,665 --> 00:45:59,539
We're both a
little stressed out.

1092
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:00,801
Tomorrow's a big day.

1093
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:11,420
You know I'll be
right there with you.

1094
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:12,551
Get some sleep.

1095
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:21,343
I am the sky.

1096
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:23,084
Nothing can stick to me.

1097
00:46:23,215 --> 00:46:26,087
The sky is open and vast
and stays unchanged,

1098
00:46:26,218 --> 00:46:28,220
no matter what happens to it.

1099
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,613
I am the sky.

1100
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:32,485
Nothing can stick to me.

1101
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:36,532
The sky is open and vast
and stays unchanged,

1102
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:39,318
no matter what happens to it.

1103
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:42,234
I am
notjust a mastectomy right side.

1104
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:44,932
I am a woman in red lipstick.

1105
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:47,456
I'm seizing control
of my future.

1106
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:49,545
I am Geralyn Lucas,
wife, daughter,

1107
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:51,809
friend, and future mother.

1108
00:46:51,939 --> 00:46:54,681
I'm going into battle
for my life, a battle

1109
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,857
that I fully intend to win.

1110
00:46:56,988 --> 00:46:58,598
And this lipstick
is my war paint.

1111
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:09,087
Do you have my mantra?

1112
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:11,089
Got it.

1113
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,308
Make sure someone readsit
to me while I go under.

1114
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:14,439
I will.

1115
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:19,793
I'm really scared.

1116
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:23,362
I know you are, but
you're going to be fine.

1117
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:24,492
I promise.

1118
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:33,546
How are you doing?

1119
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:35,113
Good morning, Geralyn.

1120
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:36,243
You OK?

1121
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:38,289
Yes.

1122
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:51,607
She's in.

1123
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:53,044
And?

1124
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:54,567
And now we wait.

1125
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,853
I'm going to get some coffee.
Does anybody...

1126
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,897
Do you want one of
us to come with you?

1127
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:02,401
No, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

1128
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:05,012
Tyler, she's going
to be OK, right?

1129
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:06,143
I promise.

1130
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:07,493
You're as worried as we are.

1131
00:48:07,623 --> 00:48:08,407
You can't promise...

1132
00:48:08,537 --> 00:48:09,364
I'm telling you.

1133
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:10,495
I spoke to her surgeon.

1134
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:11,583
He's very confident.

1135
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:12,672
She's going to be fine.

1136
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:13,934
Thank god.

1137
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:15,065
I'll be back.

1138
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,271
I suddenly knew

1139
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:48,969
why exit signs were invented,
for dangerous situations

1140
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,972
like this one, like fires,
like fleeing a building so they

1141
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:54,888
can't cut off your breast.

1142
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,585
My life was on fire.

1143
00:48:56,716 --> 00:49:00,111
I hadn't lived hard enoughyet,
and I wanted out of there.

1144
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:16,605
OK, please.

1145
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:18,148
Can you relax your
arm for me, please?

1146
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:18,999
All right.

1147
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,915
There you go.

1148
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:24,831
I am the sky.

1149
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,312
Nothing can stick to me.

1150
00:49:27,442 --> 00:49:30,706
The sky is open and vast
and stays unchanged.

1151
00:49:30,837 --> 00:49:32,597
In thesterility of the operating

1152
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:34,667
room, I am strong.

1153
00:49:34,797 --> 00:49:38,584
In the blood and gauze,
I feel like dancing.

1154
00:49:38,714 --> 00:49:41,500
Under anesthesia, I
am hopeful and maybe

1155
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,591
a little sexy and
slightly in control,

1156
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:48,898
just knowing that my
lipstick might last.

1157
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,857
I am the sky.

1158
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,424
I am the sky.

1159
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:53,554
I am the sky.

1160
00:50:04,697 --> 00:50:07,917
Is this heaven?

1161
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:09,728
No, girl, you're right
here at Mount Sinai.

1162
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:13,401
What I really wantto
know is what kind of lipstick

1163
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:14,837
is that?

1164
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:18,058
It stayed on through
six hours of surgery.

1165
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:19,407
I need to get me some of that.

1166
00:50:19,538 --> 00:50:20,538
Come on over.

1167
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:26,980
Honey?

1168
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,111
Can you open your eyes?

1169
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:33,682
Am I OK?

1170
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:35,597
Perfect.

1171
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:37,295
Couldn't have gone better.

1172
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:40,994
Your father kissed nurse Kimwhen
he, heard the news.

1173
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,387
He's a good kisser, too.

1174
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:45,390
If he wasn't already
married, I don't know.

1175
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,739
I love you.

1176
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:47,869
I love you, too.

1177
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,573
Did you feed the dog?

1178
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:57,271
Honey, we don't have a dog.

1179
00:50:57,402 --> 00:51:00,840
I know, but I was thinkingthat
we should get one.

1180
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:01,970
It's a good idea.

1181
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:05,975
Are you awake?

1182
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:06,889
She's awake.

1183
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,848
They're all here.

1184
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:10,058
How are you feeling, honey?

1185
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:11,329
Does it hurt?

1186
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:13,026
Do you want me to put the TV on?

1187
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:15,357
- Do you need anything?
- Do you want something?

1188
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:20,424
Hey.

1189
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:21,948
Hi, Dr. Crone.

1190
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,168
I wanted to come
and check on you.

1191
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:27,171
Are you managing your pain OK?

1192
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:28,346
Yeah.

1193
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:30,217
I heard things went really well.

1194
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:32,176
You found that lump yourself.

1195
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,829
I might've missed it.

1196
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,961
I'm lucky.

1197
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,223
You're very lucky.

1198
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:39,400
You're young, you're strong.

1199
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:42,969
I still want to have a baby.

1200
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,540
Changes in your hormone levelsmight
be very dangerous for you

1201
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,580
at this time.

1202
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:55,199
After the chemo,
I probablywon't be able to anyway, right?

1203
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:58,158
Please, don't even try.

1204
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:10,344
Hey, morning.

1205
00:52:10,475 --> 00:52:12,781
Hi.

1206
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:14,783
Aw, breakfast in bed.

1207
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:17,177
How're you feeling?

1208
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:20,615
Um, happy to be home.

1209
00:52:20,746 --> 00:52:22,139
I'm happy to have you home.

1210
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:23,789
I'm just going to
change your dressing.

1211
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:29,146
Honey, have you looked?

1212
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:31,713
No.

1213
00:52:31,844 --> 00:52:34,194
Dr. Bradley wanted
me to, but I can't.

1214
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:39,199
I don't want you to
see me like this.

1215
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,516
Honey.

1216
00:52:51,646 --> 00:52:52,865
Open your eyes.

1217
00:52:52,995 --> 00:52:55,172
No.

1218
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:56,956
Open your eyes.

1219
00:52:57,086 --> 00:52:58,086
It's OK to look.

1220
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:09,360
My god.

1221
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:13,451
My god, a Frankensteinmonster boob.

1222
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:15,931
Run... run while you can.

1223
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:17,194
Run.

1224
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:20,414
I'm going to
change the dressings.

1225
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:21,807
And then...

1226
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:24,113
And then you can leave
and never look back.

1227
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:25,332
No one will blame you.

1228
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:32,426
No one, but I want
to keep the dog.

1229
00:53:32,557 --> 00:53:36,343
Then, can we make love?

1230
00:53:39,477 --> 00:53:40,913
With me?

1231
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:45,700
Well, yeah, you're mygirl,
and you're beautiful.

1232
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:47,572
And I need you to know that, so.

1233
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:54,796
Can you get me my lipstick?

1234
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,102
Yeah.

1235
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,233
Yeah.

1236
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:08,593
I don't want to hurt you.

1237
00:54:08,723 --> 00:54:09,723
You're not.

1238
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:17,862
You OK?

1239
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:23,389
I love you.

1240
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:26,871
I love you, too.

1241
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:40,364
My
Newchest was making its debut.

1242
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:42,670
Between the expander
booband some clever padding,

1243
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:46,935
I could pull off somepretty
impressive cleavage.

1244
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:48,110
Is this the chemo room?

1245
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:48,981
Mrs. Lucas.

1246
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,070
Yes.

1247
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,289
I'm Stella.

1248
00:54:52,419 --> 00:54:53,570
We've got everything
set up for you.

1249
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:56,989
Just make yourself comfortable.

1250
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,079
This is the CMF cocktailyour
doctor ordered for you.

1251
00:55:03,343 --> 00:55:04,343
Virgin?

1252
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:05,214
What?

1253
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:07,086
I mean first time.

1254
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:08,216
Yes.

1255
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:09,421
Well, it shouldn't be so bad.

1256
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,003
You have your sister
here with you.

1257
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:12,744
She's... she's my mother.

1258
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:14,223
I know.

1259
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:15,549
Just said that in case
she has some chocolate.

1260
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:19,011
Matter of fact, I do.

1261
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:20,141
I'll bring more.

1262
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:21,318
Thank you.

1263
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:22,971
Let me tell you
something, baby girl.

1264
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:24,930
The best thing
about having cancer,

1265
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,932
it's a get out of
jail free card.

1266
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:29,717
It's like, I can't pick
youup at the airport tonight.

1267
00:55:29,848 --> 00:55:31,458
I have cancer.

1268
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:33,417
I can't watch your cat.

1269
00:55:33,547 --> 00:55:35,027
I have cancer.

1270
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:36,028
Moneisha, please.

1271
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:37,638
Sorry, Ms. Thing.

1272
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:39,727
I have cancer.

1273
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:41,138
I'll start your trip now.

1274
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:50,695
Thank you.

1275
00:55:50,825 --> 00:55:53,350
You know, I was lying
down back there,

1276
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,221
and I was worrying about myself.

1277
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,136
And then I saw you.

1278
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:58,703
What are you, in your 20s?

1279
00:55:58,833 --> 00:55:59,704
Yes.

1280
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:01,880
Unbelievably tragic.

1281
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,361
You see, at my age,
youexpect something like this,

1282
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:11,368
but well, anyway,
thank youfor making me feel better.

1283
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:12,498
Goodbye, Mrs. Jackson.

1284
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:25,816
Taxi.

1285
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:30,648
Taxi.

1286
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:32,171
Darling, let me do it.

1287
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:33,301
Taxi!

1288
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:38,499
Darling, are you sure you're OK?

1289
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:40,658
I can take you home,
stay overnight, take

1290
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:41,852
the morning train to Philly.

1291
00:56:41,876 --> 00:56:42,616
I'm feeling fine.

1292
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:43,747
Really, I am.

1293
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:46,185
I love you.

1294
00:56:46,315 --> 00:56:47,447
You don't feel sick?

1295
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:49,188
I feel fine.

1296
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:51,973
They told me that somepeople
don't even get sick.

1297
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:07,118
Yuck.

1298
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:23,003
Hi.

1299
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:32,404
Surprise!

1300
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:39,325
Guys, thank you so much.

1301
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,892
Welcome back, Geralyn.

1302
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:41,893
You look great.

1303
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:44,069
I'm so glad you're back.

1304
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:46,071
Thank you so much.

1305
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:46,985
Now get out of here.

1306
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:47,899
No, I'm fine.

1307
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:49,640
Really, I'm...

1308
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,618
Even Superman took a breakwhen
he encountered kryptonite.

1309
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:53,513
You go home, you take it easy.

1310
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:55,360
We'll still think of you
as Supergirl, I promise.

1311
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:56,124
I need to be here.

1312
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:57,517
I feel normal.

1313
00:57:57,648 --> 00:58:01,086
Please don't make me go home.

1314
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:02,522
Eat some cake?

1315
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:04,655
This chocolate sure does cover

1316
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:05,945
up that metallic chemo taste.

1317
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:08,049
Everything that I've
been eating tastes

1318
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,182
like a rusty nail, Moneisha.

1319
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:12,140
Moneisha is not my real name.

1320
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:13,271
That's my porno name.

1321
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:18,973
My real name is Monica.

1322
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:19,887
You're in porn?

1323
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:21,541
No.

1324
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:23,935
But everybody should havea
porno name just in case.

1325
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:26,111
You see, I took the
name of my first pet,

1326
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,721
the street I grew up on.

1327
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:28,853
I put them together.

1328
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:29,984
Moneisha Alpine.

1329
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,859
What's yours?

1330
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:35,990
Bootsy Blanch.

1331
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:38,036
I like that.

1332
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,298
What's yours?

1333
00:58:39,428 --> 00:58:43,128
Pepper Oregon.

1334
00:58:43,258 --> 00:58:44,390
Italy Lacont.

1335
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:50,178
Fido Topeka.

1336
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:55,159
Tyler andl
discovered a whole new idea

1337
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:56,881
of what romance is.

1338
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:59,492
It's pulling back your
wife'sthinning hair while she pukes

1339
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:01,059
so hard she shivers to death.

1340
00:59:04,149 --> 00:59:05,149
I'm OK.

1341
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,550
Is she OK?

1342
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:21,470
Yeah, I tried giving herginger
and mango because I read

1343
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:24,735
that it helped some people.

1344
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,041
She's making her sicker.

1345
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:29,043
And I've talked
to every person I

1346
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:30,454
could possibly
get in touch with,

1347
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:33,439
and no one has any new answers.

1348
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,223
And I don't know
what's coming next.

1349
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:36,834
And I feel helpless.

1350
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,030
You're doing everything you can.

1351
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:44,232
No, see, I can't do
anything to help her.

1352
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:47,584
And I'm... I'm... what kindof
doctor does that make me?

1353
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:49,498
Forget what kind
of doctor you are.

1354
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:53,502
Think what kind of
husband you are.

1355
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:55,635
The two of you will
bestronger because of this.

1356
00:59:58,856 --> 00:59:59,856
Thank you.

1357
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:09,431
Tyler, I know it's been
hardhaving us around all the time.

1358
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:11,259
But we don't know
any other way to be.

1359
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:19,790
Hey.

1360
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,269
I'm so cold.

1361
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,619
I know.

1362
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:25,273
I mean, that's the drugs.

1363
01:00:25,404 --> 01:00:26,448
Please don't go in today.

1364
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:27,711
- I have to.
- No.

1365
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:29,103
No, you don't.
- I do have to.

1366
01:00:29,234 --> 01:00:30,017
No, listen.

1367
01:00:30,148 --> 01:00:31,584
Hey.

1368
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,891
Most people going
throughchemo, they stay home.

1369
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:35,980
They try to recover.

1370
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,329
What are you trying to prove?

1371
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:51,972
Hearing my black pumps

1372
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:55,303
click against the hospitalfloor
makes me feel hopeful.

1373
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:58,089
I need to reclaim
myself by being daring.

1374
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:01,701
The more my hair falls out,
the shorter my skirts will get.

1375
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:04,965
Living with risk
has made me risque.

1376
01:01:05,096 --> 01:01:08,752
I never thought a shampoocommercial
could make me cry.

1377
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,492
Last night, I was
drooling over the one

1378
01:01:10,623 --> 01:01:13,539
where that woman whips
herhair back in slow motion,

1379
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,455
and then they kind of
freezewhen she flips it back.

1380
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:18,979
Honey, that's just hair porn.

1381
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,068
Everything's going
to make you cry.

1382
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:23,723
And you're going to feel
very, very frightened.

1383
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:25,856
I'm terrified all the time.

1384
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:27,640
And Tyler says that I
should stop worrying

1385
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,424
like I've beaten this thing.

1386
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:32,906
My family, I
simply wore them out.

1387
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:37,519
And the doctors gave me
three months to live.

1388
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,217
That was over two years ago.

1389
01:01:39,347 --> 01:01:40,958
Today I feel good.

1390
01:01:41,088 --> 01:01:43,351
Today is all that matters.

1391
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:46,224
I'm going to be fly until I die.

1392
01:01:46,354 --> 01:01:48,835
I'm going to win
mybling-bling and everything.

1393
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:53,666
You're not afraid to die?

1394
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:55,077
Have you ever
been to Disneyland?

1395
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:55,973
Yeah.

1396
01:01:56,103 --> 01:01:57,975
My goodness.

1397
01:01:58,105 --> 01:02:01,195
I stood in that long line,
and I realized something

1398
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:04,242
scared me more than death...

1399
01:02:04,372 --> 01:02:06,070
Reincarnation.

1400
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,506
Really?

1401
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:09,290
There was absolutely
no one in that line

1402
01:02:09,421 --> 01:02:10,421
I wanted to come back as.

1403
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:15,296
I find peace in knowing
the truth about God.

1404
01:02:15,427 --> 01:02:17,734
She's a selfish son of a gun.

1405
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:20,780
Eventually, she
wants us all back.

1406
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:31,922
Can you hold the elevator?

1407
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,052
Hold it!

1408
01:02:36,274 --> 01:02:37,642
Please don't throw up.

1409
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:38,711
Please don't throw up.

1410
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:39,922
It's good to see you, Gail.

1411
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,065
Thank you so much
for the flowers.

1412
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,546
They were so beautiful.

1413
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:49,766
And you're so very welcome.

1414
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:51,613
Pleasedon't throw up on Victor.

1415
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:52,917
Please don't throw up on Victor.

1416
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:59,427
A major achievement...
Ididn't throw up on Victor.

1417
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:01,038
It's good to have
you back, Geralyn.

1418
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:03,431
Thank you.

1419
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:08,610
Idid, however, hit my shoes.

1420
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:20,448
Taxi.

1421
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:21,579
Please.

1422
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:31,808
Don't whistle.

1423
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:33,418
I don't think you're
that cute either.

1424
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:50,914
I will never ever make funof
men's comb overs again.

1425
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:53,046
You still look great.

1426
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:55,396
Liar.

1427
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:58,791
Every time the wind
blows, I panic.

1428
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,793
Today's chemo, are you coming?

1429
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,534
I'm in surgery
until 3:00, so I'll

1430
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:05,493
see if I can make it after.

1431
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:07,844
It feels like two ships
passing in the night.

1432
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:09,628
You know what?

1433
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:11,998
I'll be there this afternoon,
and then if you're up for it,

1434
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:12,849
we'll grab a bite.

1435
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:13,719
A date?

1436
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,808
Yeah, a date.

1437
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,941
I've already locatedthe
port in your expander

1438
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:20,421
and it's filling with
saline right now.

1439
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:22,206
I'll continue to
fill it with saline

1440
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:25,252
every two weeks to
stretchyour skin and muscle

1441
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:27,820
until we reach the right size.

1442
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,953
Later, we'll
replace the expander

1443
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,738
with a permanent implant.

1444
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,610
God is it supposed
to hurt this much?

1445
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:37,003
I know it's uncomfortable.

1446
01:04:39,745 --> 01:04:41,312
Uncomfortable.

1447
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:43,444
Can skin actually burst?

1448
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:46,447
Not typically, it
just feels like it.

1449
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:50,016
OK, if it's going to
hurt this much, then

1450
01:04:50,147 --> 01:04:50,930
I'd better stop traffic.

1451
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:54,064
Make them huge.

1452
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:56,893
What did you have in mind?

1453
01:04:57,023 --> 01:05:00,897
Give me Pamela Anderson breasts.

1454
01:05:01,027 --> 01:05:03,900
Well, we have to be carefulbecause
you're a small frame.

1455
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:07,033
What is she, a 34B?

1456
01:05:07,164 --> 01:05:10,384
Probably at birth.

1457
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:25,182
You'll remember
mewhen the west wind moves...

1458
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:28,489
Dr. Lucas, Geralyn andthe
gang left an hour ago.

1459
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:30,948
I must have the time wrong.

1460
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:37,324
You can tellthe
sun in his jealous sky

1461
01:05:37,455 --> 01:05:42,242
when we walked in
fields of gold.

1462
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:56,300
Hey, guys.

1463
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,257
Hi, Tyler.

1464
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:58,650
Hey, Tyler.

1465
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,280
- We're making pizza.
- We're making pizza.

1466
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:01,566
What kind do you want?
Hi.

1467
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:02,696
Hey.

1468
01:06:02,784 --> 01:06:03,655
Um, I'm feeling a little sleepy.

1469
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:05,744
I think I'm going to crash.

1470
01:06:05,874 --> 01:06:06,745
You OK?

1471
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:07,964
Yeah, why wouldn't I be OK?

1472
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:13,708
Tyler.

1473
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,014
Um, I...

1474
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:17,712
I came by your chemo
appointment today.

1475
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:19,192
You and the gang
had already left.

1476
01:06:19,323 --> 01:06:21,064
I rescheduled to earlier.

1477
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:22,194
I'm so sorry.

1478
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:24,154
I didn't think that you'd come.

1479
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:27,548
Well, honey, I told you
I was going to be there.

1480
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:28,959
Sweetie, you've
said that before.

1481
01:06:33,902 --> 01:06:35,513
Are you sure you
want to be alone?

1482
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:36,723
You should try it sometime.

1483
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:43,521
So she took her love for to gaze

1484
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:46,872
awhile among the
fields of barley.

1485
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:55,924
In his arms she fell
as her hair came

1486
01:06:56,055 --> 01:07:00,407
down among the fields of gold.

1487
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:07,327
Will you stay with me?

1488
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:15,458
Will you be my love
amongthe fields of barley?

1489
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:22,299
And you can tell the
sun in his jealous sky

1490
01:07:22,429 --> 01:07:23,996
when we walked in
fields of gold.

1491
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:35,964
You'll remember me when
the west wind moves

1492
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:37,270
among the fields of barley.

1493
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:46,671
You can tell the sun
in his jealous sky

1494
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:52,285
when we walked in
fields of gold.

1495
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:56,681
When we walked in
fields of gold.

1496
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:24,535
Hey Geralyn.

1497
01:08:24,665 --> 01:08:26,102
Hey.

1498
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:27,818
Um, listen,
I think I'mgoing to be late tonight.

1499
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:29,298
I'm going out to dinner
withsome of the other doctors

1500
01:08:29,322 --> 01:08:31,237
from work.

1501
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:32,368
OK.

1502
01:08:32,456 --> 01:08:33,456
You don't mind, do you?

1503
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:35,763
Um, no, I...

1504
01:08:35,894 --> 01:08:40,333
Maybe we could have
dinner on Friday night.

1505
01:08:40,464 --> 01:08:41,987
Friday.
Yeah, Friday.

1506
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,380
You know what?

1507
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,686
I think I have a late
surgery that night.

1508
01:08:45,817 --> 01:08:47,097
Tell you what,
let's play by ear.

1509
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,210
Sure.

1510
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:16,606
Thesaline injections were doing

1511
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,545
their job, but it's
funny the things

1512
01:09:18,676 --> 01:09:20,547
the doctor forgets to tell you.

1513
01:09:20,678 --> 01:09:22,419
Honey, you need some help?

1514
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:23,550
No, thank you.

1515
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:25,639
I'm... actually, yes.

1516
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:29,469
I'm lopsided.

1517
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,732
The whole
worldis lopsided sometimes.

1518
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:36,172
It's up to each one of usto
find our inner balance.

1519
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:37,912
Forget about inner balance.

1520
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:39,323
I need to find my
inner cleavage.

1521
01:09:55,016 --> 01:09:57,236
If I saw you on the street,
I'd buy you a fur coat.

1522
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:02,589
Can I help you?

1523
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,721
I hope so.

1524
01:10:03,851 --> 01:10:05,853
Do my hips look big in this hat?

1525
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:07,507
Not at all.

1526
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:08,769
Queens from Queens.

1527
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,032
Are you here for a cut?

1528
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:13,252
Um, no.

1529
01:10:13,383 --> 01:10:16,081
Actually, I started chemo.

1530
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:22,566
And I started releasing,
and um, I just need a wig.

1531
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:24,742
I have just what you need.

1532
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:26,570
Really?

1533
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,790
I promise you'll be gorgeous,
even more gorgeous than them.

1534
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:32,880
Because she won't
have to cover a beard.

1535
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:34,273
Come on.

1536
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:49,941
Bea Arthur or Estelle Getty?

1537
01:10:59,516 --> 01:11:00,604
I feel like a fraud.

1538
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:06,174
Then go for the real thing.

1539
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,350
Ta-da!

1540
01:11:11,179 --> 01:11:13,747
Sugar.

1541
01:11:13,878 --> 01:11:16,402
It's what's in here that counts.

1542
01:11:16,533 --> 01:11:18,883
Anyone who can't see
how beautiful you are

1543
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:20,013
ain't worth your time.

1544
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:24,908
Go figure.

1545
01:11:24,932 --> 01:11:27,631
The Queen of Hearts
was from Queens.

1546
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:30,677
And yet another angel that
Ineed to meet crosses my path.

1547
01:11:32,549 --> 01:11:36,596
I hand you
a robe and so it goes.

1548
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:38,555
The moment had passed.

1549
01:11:38,685 --> 01:11:43,473
You're Simone de Beauvoiras
you get out the car.

1550
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:50,958
The way you read me
no one can see me.

1551
01:11:51,089 --> 01:11:52,089
It's who you are.

1552
01:11:55,006 --> 01:11:58,662
These photographs keep me alive.

1553
01:12:04,145 --> 01:12:08,976
Babe, here's your song.

1554
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:21,633
Babe, it took too long to findin
your eyes my best surprise.

1555
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:34,306
You're Nina Simone when
you talk on the phone.

1556
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:42,227
You sing to me, and I'm
truly no longer alone.

1557
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:50,191
You're Mary Cassatt whenpeople
tell you you're not.

1558
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:58,635
Babe, here's your song.

1559
01:13:03,335 --> 01:13:11,335
Babe, it took too long to findin
your eyes my best surprise.

1560
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:21,024
Do youwear
your hat all the time?

1561
01:13:21,048 --> 01:13:22,572
Can't get a date?

1562
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:24,854
If you are ashamed of a
recedinghairline, thinning hair,

1563
01:13:24,878 --> 01:13:26,726
or baldness,
then the hairglove for men is for you.

1564
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,490
Hey, honey.

1565
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,100
How are you feeling?

1566
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:31,034
Thelatest
treatments for baldness.

1567
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:32,408
These poor men.

1568
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:33,844
What's wrong?

1569
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:36,542
There's so muchsuffering over hair loss.

1570
01:13:36,673 --> 01:13:39,458
There is definite discrimination
against the follically

1571
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:40,589
challenged.

1572
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:42,287
Honey, that's a little nuts.

1573
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,071
It's easy for you to say, you

1574
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:47,379
with your fancy head of hair.

1575
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:48,293
You made dinner?

1576
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,556
Yeah, it's Friday night.

1577
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:51,905
We had a date.

1578
01:13:52,036 --> 01:13:53,733
Honey, I said we
should play it by here.

1579
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:55,518
I had surgery until late.

1580
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:58,172
Besides, I figured you'd go
outwith your friends after chemo.

1581
01:13:58,303 --> 01:14:00,261
I, um...

1582
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:01,785
I misunderstood.

1583
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:04,657
How was chemo today?

1584
01:14:04,788 --> 01:14:05,832
The usual.

1585
01:14:05,963 --> 01:14:07,965
Got poisoned, came
home, threw up.

1586
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:09,095
Sorry I missed it.

1587
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,300
What's that supposed to mean?

1588
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:16,277
Everyone comes every
week, except you.

1589
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:17,235
Yeah, exactly.

1590
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:18,192
Everyone comes.

1591
01:14:18,323 --> 01:14:19,193
Why do you need me there?

1592
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:20,107
Because they're not you.

1593
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:21,369
I need you, too.

1594
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,154
It just doesn't
feel that way to me.

1595
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:26,549
So, you're mad at me becausel
have people who care about me?

1596
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:28,135
I mean, do you... do
you want to me to make

1597
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,856
me pick between them and you?

1598
01:14:29,987 --> 01:14:32,642
Or maybe you want
me to suffer alone?

1599
01:14:32,772 --> 01:14:34,034
I do.

1600
01:14:34,165 --> 01:14:36,863
It sure didn't seem
like that the other day.

1601
01:14:36,994 --> 01:14:38,474
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

1602
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:40,103
No, no, what...
What... what did you say?

1603
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:41,127
What did you say?

1604
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:45,021
I came by the hospitalto
see you the other day,

1605
01:14:45,045 --> 01:14:46,482
and you were talking
to some girl.

1606
01:14:46,612 --> 01:14:47,787
Girl, what?

1607
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:49,528
What girl?

1608
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:52,531
You seemed pretty involved,
so I didn't want to bother you.

1609
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:54,117
You came all the way
down to the hospital,

1610
01:14:54,141 --> 01:14:55,752
and you didn't come talk to me?

1611
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:58,842
You seemed kind of busy,
justlike you were busy tonight.

1612
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:00,332
I can't believe
you're saying that.

1613
01:15:03,063 --> 01:15:06,502
You know, I don't care somuch
that you're accusing me

1614
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:11,028
of, I think, being
unfaithful to you,

1615
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:16,076
but um, it's that youwaited
to ask me about it.

1616
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:17,967
Geralyn, you're not theonly
one who's suffering.

1617
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:21,038
The only difference is I don'tneed
a marching band to follow

1618
01:15:21,168 --> 01:15:22,208
me around everywhere I go.

1619
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:38,403
Tyler?

1620
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,578
Yeah.

1621
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,717
You OK?

1622
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:48,847
Fine.

1623
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,813
I'm OK, I'm OK.

1624
01:15:56,943 --> 01:15:57,814
Sweetie.

1625
01:15:57,944 --> 01:15:58,944
Good.

1626
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:04,037
You don't need me.

1627
01:16:04,168 --> 01:16:05,778
What?

1628
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:07,103
That's why I don't come
toyour treatments because I...

1629
01:16:07,127 --> 01:16:11,262
I... it's my fault.
I gave you cancer.

1630
01:16:11,392 --> 01:16:12,568
What?

1631
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:15,092
When I did my breast
cancer rotation,

1632
01:16:15,222 --> 01:16:16,702
I told you about
that girl who died,

1633
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,835
and then I put
that in your head.

1634
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:19,965
Tyler.

1635
01:16:23,274 --> 01:16:24,492
I'm a little sick.

1636
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:26,973
Use my knee pillow.

1637
01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:31,412
Damn it.

1638
01:16:31,543 --> 01:16:33,589
My god.

1639
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:34,719
Aw, sweetie.

1640
01:16:34,807 --> 01:16:35,547
It's fine.

1641
01:16:35,678 --> 01:16:36,678
It's fine.

1642
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:45,077
Thanks.

1643
01:16:47,994 --> 01:16:50,431
Now we both have scars.

1644
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:52,869
Except yours...
Yours is for bravery.

1645
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:56,786
Mine is being an idiot.

1646
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:59,223
I get it now.

1647
01:16:59,353 --> 01:17:01,399
I know how you feel.

1648
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:03,575
Like a moron?

1649
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:06,665
I wish they were
stitching up my head.

1650
01:17:06,796 --> 01:17:09,929
I wish that I was
the one who had cancer.

1651
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,023
Don't.

1652
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:18,503
What?

1653
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:23,116
I look like a cue ball.

1654
01:17:23,247 --> 01:17:31,247
All I see is my wife,
mycourageous, my beautiful wife.

1655
01:17:32,822 --> 01:17:35,651
And I am so proud
to be your husband.

1656
01:17:38,828 --> 01:17:39,828
Come on.

1657
01:17:44,137 --> 01:17:47,619
So, you gave me cancer
bytelling me about that girl

1658
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,099
that you treated?

1659
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:50,317
No, I...

1660
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:52,406
I just... I told
you all about it.

1661
01:17:52,537 --> 01:17:54,757
I know how
impressionable you are.

1662
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:59,413
I was wrecked by it,
and Iwas just laying it all on you.

1663
01:17:59,544 --> 01:18:03,026
You don't believe
in religion or faith,

1664
01:18:03,156 --> 01:18:05,004
and you make fun of me becausel
won't walk under a ladder

1665
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:06,333
and I read my horoscopes.

1666
01:18:06,464 --> 01:18:09,685
But this, you believe
that you unconsciously

1667
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:11,382
gave me cancer by conversation?

1668
01:18:14,994 --> 01:18:17,344
Telling me about that
woman you treated,

1669
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:22,262
making it so real for
me, and that's what made

1670
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:23,544
me think it could happen to me.

1671
01:18:23,568 --> 01:18:26,136
That's why I did self exams.

1672
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:30,444
You telling me about that
girlmight be what saved my life.

1673
01:18:33,883 --> 01:18:34,883
Let's go home.

1674
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:46,306
- I
- must'vebeen feeling the guilt gene

1675
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:48,569
because when a women's magazineasked
if I'd be willing to have

1676
01:18:48,593 --> 01:18:50,987
my breasts photographed inorder
to encourage others who'd

1677
01:18:51,117 --> 01:18:53,076
had mastectomies, I said yes.

1678
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:54,686
I'll tell her.

1679
01:18:54,817 --> 01:18:55,924
Butfirst, I had to get a nipple.

1680
01:18:55,948 --> 01:18:57,268
Honey, that was
Dr. Keel's office.

1681
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:58,492
You're late for
your appointment.

1682
01:18:58,516 --> 01:18:59,909
I don't want to go.

1683
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:01,519
Do you want me to go with you?

1684
01:19:01,649 --> 01:19:04,000
No.

1685
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,306
I'm having nipple ambivalence.

1686
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:07,437
Who am I doing this for?

1687
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:09,135
Am I doing it for you or for me?

1688
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:10,896
Because we're actually bothgoing
to know that it's fake,

1689
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,636
so am I doing it to be likean
average two nippled woman

1690
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,663
or so I can look normal
changingin a women's locker room?

1691
01:19:15,794 --> 01:19:17,380
Maybe it's so I can
prancearound a topless beach.

1692
01:19:17,404 --> 01:19:18,666
Well, you know...

1693
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:19,948
Tyler, but nipples
are so in right now.

1694
01:19:19,972 --> 01:19:21,297
They're like a must
have accessory.

1695
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:22,429
OK, look, women are
wearing these white,

1696
01:19:22,453 --> 01:19:23,613
sheer, little, thin shirts...

1697
01:19:23,715 --> 01:19:24,455
Honey, honey, honey.

1698
01:19:24,585 --> 01:19:25,456
No bra.

1699
01:19:25,586 --> 01:19:27,850
Honey, it's your breast.

1700
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,373
So no matter what
you do, I promise

1701
01:19:29,503 --> 01:19:31,549
to honor and cherish it.

1702
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,944
But let... let... let's justbe
clear about one thing.

1703
01:19:35,074 --> 01:19:37,598
Under no circumstances
are you ever

1704
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:41,167
going to be average or normal.

1705
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,234
I wasso sick of wearing my heart

1706
01:19:45,258 --> 01:19:47,478
on my sleeve that I
decidedto have it prominently

1707
01:19:47,608 --> 01:19:50,916
etched on my boob instead.

1708
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:52,135
Hey.

1709
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:53,136
Hey.

1710
01:19:53,266 --> 01:19:54,137
I saw you walking around.

1711
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,747
I thought you might be lost.

1712
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:57,314
Caught.

1713
01:19:57,444 --> 01:20:01,405
Um, I was actually wondering,
can you do a tattoo

1714
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,581
on a breast reconstruction?

1715
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:04,711
Sure.

1716
01:20:04,756 --> 01:20:06,410
We do it all the time, actually.

1717
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,823
There's 10 layers of skin soyou
actually get to the implant.

1718
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:11,067
We only have to
go three deep, so.

1719
01:20:11,197 --> 01:20:11,937
Really?

1720
01:20:12,068 --> 01:20:13,547
Yeah.

1721
01:20:13,678 --> 01:20:14,678
Cancer?

1722
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:16,072
Um, yes.

1723
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:17,421
Yeah.

1724
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:19,336
My grandmother had
cancer when she was 40,

1725
01:20:19,466 --> 01:20:21,773
and she lived till she was 85.

1726
01:20:21,904 --> 01:20:23,949
You kind of look like
you're actually good.

1727
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,080
Come on in.

1728
01:20:27,518 --> 01:20:28,518
Another angel.

1729
01:20:34,655 --> 01:20:37,528
So, um, I don't want
to get a nipple tattoo.

1730
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:38,442
Good.

1731
01:20:38,572 --> 01:20:39,572
They're so yesterday.

1732
01:20:41,445 --> 01:20:43,031
You're not going to get
a man's name, are you?

1733
01:20:43,055 --> 01:20:44,622
No, why?

1734
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:46,363
Because I have to
remind you that Johnny

1735
01:20:46,493 --> 01:20:48,974
Depp had to change his Winonaforever
tattoo to Wino forever.

1736
01:20:51,237 --> 01:20:52,064
OK.

1737
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:53,065
Have a seat.

1738
01:20:53,196 --> 01:20:54,284
No man's name.

1739
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:56,808
No man's name.

1740
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:00,725
Um, so I want a heartto
remind me of my courage

1741
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,989
and the courage of
everyone around me.

1742
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,124
And I just want it atthe
lower end of my scar.

1743
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:13,346
And, um, I want wings
at the top to remind

1744
01:21:13,477 --> 01:21:15,783
me of all the
angels who showed me

1745
01:21:15,914 --> 01:21:17,611
that I would get my life back.

1746
01:21:17,742 --> 01:21:19,048
Nice.

1747
01:21:19,178 --> 01:21:20,895
Would you like to show
me where you'd like it?

1748
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:21,919
Um.

1749
01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:26,751
That's OK.

1750
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,276
My husband is the only onewho
has ever seen me like this.

1751
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:36,934
It's right here.

1752
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:41,548
You're a very foxy lady.

1753
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,507
No, I'm not.

1754
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:46,292
You are.

1755
01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:47,703
Your husband's a very lucky man.

1756
01:21:50,383 --> 01:21:51,863
Why did I agree to do this?

1757
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:53,996
For all the women who
were scared like you.

1758
01:21:54,126 --> 01:21:55,606
Well, what if
they're not inspired

1759
01:21:55,736 --> 01:21:57,236
when they look at the
pictureand they're grossed out?

1760
01:21:57,260 --> 01:22:00,567
That'll never happen.

1761
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:02,067
I've never liked
even one single picture

1762
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:03,353
I've ever taken of myself.

1763
01:22:03,483 --> 01:22:05,203
And I've got a weird
smile and a round face,

1764
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:06,182
and I've got a snaggle tooth.

1765
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:07,400
And my eyes are not...

1766
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:08,314
What?

1767
01:22:08,445 --> 01:22:09,968
That's all true.

1768
01:22:10,099 --> 01:22:11,685
And it's good to hear
youcomplain about that stuff

1769
01:22:11,709 --> 01:22:13,058
again.

1770
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:14,277
But you are beautiful.

1771
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:19,890
Go.

1772
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:33,078
Hi, I'm Geralyn Lucas.

1773
01:22:33,209 --> 01:22:34,732
"Self Magazine"
sent me over here

1774
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:36,797
to have pictures taken
fortheir breast cancer article.

1775
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:38,146
Hair and makeup,
they're ready for you.

1776
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,259
Great.

1777
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:42,671
Maybethis
is why women pose topless.

1778
01:22:42,783 --> 01:22:44,326
- Can I grab a cookie?
- They're ready for you.

1779
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:45,134
Yes.

1780
01:22:45,264 --> 01:22:47,005
OK.

1781
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:48,528
Hi, I'm Geralyn.

1782
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:50,115
Um, I just washed my
hair, but I didn't

1783
01:22:50,139 --> 01:22:51,377
do anything to it
because they told me

1784
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:52,508
that you guys were going to...

1785
01:22:52,532 --> 01:22:54,360
Don't touch her hair.

1786
01:22:54,491 --> 01:22:56,536
I love it like that.

1787
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:57,667
Hi, I'm Geralyn.

1788
01:22:57,755 --> 01:22:58,538
Nice to meet you.

1789
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:00,366
Come along.

1790
01:23:00,497 --> 01:23:02,978
Stand on that mark.

1791
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:04,283
Right here?

1792
01:23:04,414 --> 01:23:05,415
Take your shirt off.

1793
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:06,633
What?

1794
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:08,374
Take your shirt off.

1795
01:23:08,505 --> 01:23:10,855
Usually, I make someone
buy me dinner for that.

1796
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:13,771
Um, I don't have
hair and makeup yet.

1797
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:14,901
Now.

1798
01:23:18,036 --> 01:23:22,475
Can I,
at least justhave some red lipstick?

1799
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:23,433
Please?

1800
01:23:23,563 --> 01:23:25,043
It gives me courage.

1801
01:23:25,174 --> 01:23:26,174
Sure.

1802
01:23:26,262 --> 01:23:27,262
Red lipstick!

1803
01:23:35,401 --> 01:23:38,491
- I
- shouldhave used Tyler's deodorant

1804
01:23:38,622 --> 01:23:40,972
because it's a clear
stickto avoid the deodorant

1805
01:23:41,103 --> 01:23:44,062
lines in my topless photo.

1806
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:46,238
Can they airbrush
out deodorant lines?

1807
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:49,241
Can they airbrush in a nipple?

1808
01:23:49,372 --> 01:23:51,287
I need something
to center me here.

1809
01:23:51,417 --> 01:23:53,593
I need to lick the
beeswaxand taste the courage.

1810
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,046
I'm sorry.

1811
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:13,415
I'm... I'm having
second thoughts.

1812
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:14,223
I...

1813
01:24:14,353 --> 01:24:16,181
I promise you.

1814
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:18,749
This is going to be
tasteful, and you're

1815
01:24:18,879 --> 01:24:20,055
going to look beautiful.

1816
01:24:23,623 --> 01:24:24,623
Yes.

1817
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:36,071
And your bra.

1818
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:37,333
Yes.

1819
01:24:37,463 --> 01:24:38,463
Turn.

1820
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:45,992
OK.

1821
01:24:50,868 --> 01:24:54,393
Now, drop your arms.

1822
01:24:54,524 --> 01:24:57,440
I was thinking maybethat I
could, um, like, drape

1823
01:24:57,570 --> 01:25:00,007
an arm fold my arms acrossmy
chest so that you saw it

1824
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:01,748
and turn it maybe
a little so you

1825
01:25:01,879 --> 01:25:05,578
could see the tattoo and, um,
a bit of the scar, but not...

1826
01:25:05,709 --> 01:25:06,971
No.

1827
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,662
Everyone will wonder
what you're hiding.

1828
01:25:12,716 --> 01:25:13,978
I'm not hiding.

1829
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:14,848
I just...

1830
01:25:14,979 --> 01:25:16,023
You're beautiful.

1831
01:25:39,438 --> 01:25:40,178
I'm so sorry.

1832
01:25:40,309 --> 01:25:42,311
Um, I can't do this.

1833
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:44,748
I... I... please don't
let them publish it.

1834
01:25:44,878 --> 01:25:47,359
Just, like, rip
it up or burn it.

1835
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,926
I will pay for your session.

1836
01:25:49,056 --> 01:25:51,320
It's just when I
agreed to the magazine,

1837
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:54,714
I thought I was going to
be able to cover more.

1838
01:25:54,845 --> 01:25:57,282
You look so strong.

1839
01:25:57,413 --> 01:25:58,413
Look at yourself.

1840
01:26:02,635 --> 01:26:04,855
- I
- don't recognize myself.

1841
01:26:04,985 --> 01:26:09,990
I see my eyes and a depththat
I've never seen before.

1842
01:26:10,121 --> 01:26:12,689
I see a journey.

1843
01:26:12,819 --> 01:26:15,387
I set out to inspire other
womenthat they could be beautiful,

1844
01:26:15,518 --> 01:26:17,607
and I ended up
convincing myself.

1845
01:26:20,349 --> 01:26:23,265
I was robbed of my innocence,
my life, my future,

1846
01:26:23,395 --> 01:26:25,571
of an actual piece of me.

1847
01:26:25,702 --> 01:26:27,573
I decided I would
steal it all back.

1848
01:26:35,538 --> 01:26:38,149
My scar looks like a skidmark
where I hit the brakes

1849
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,760
and came so close to death.

1850
01:26:40,891 --> 01:26:43,807
The photographer has
capturedsomething so honest and raw,

1851
01:26:43,937 --> 01:26:45,504
it is unfamiliar.

1852
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:48,159
Now, where there
was a huge defect,

1853
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:50,944
I was the most beautiful.

1854
01:26:51,075 --> 01:26:54,470
I finally found
my inner cleavage.

1855
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,778
Geralyn, you want to
try and win the lottery?

1856
01:26:58,909 --> 01:27:00,650
I already have.

1857
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,261
Noone is guaranteed a future.

1858
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:07,961
Moneisha taught me to hold
ontotoday and let go of tomorrow.

1859
01:27:08,092 --> 01:27:10,268
I lost Moneisha and
too many friends

1860
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:12,836
to worry about what will be.

1861
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,316
I no longer make lists.

1862
01:27:14,446 --> 01:27:17,580
I just put one foot
in front of the other,

1863
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:21,714
and I look for theangels who walk among us.

1864
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:27,719
One more.

1865
01:27:27,807 --> 01:27:28,678
It hurts.

1866
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:30,070
One more.
One big one.

1867
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:31,071
I can't.

1868
01:27:31,202 --> 01:27:32,072
One more.

1869
01:27:32,203 --> 01:27:33,509
One more.

1870
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:54,094
My little Sky.

1871
01:27:54,225 --> 01:27:55,550
Your daddy and
I have been waiting

1872
01:27:55,574 --> 01:27:57,228
such a long time for you.

1873
01:27:57,359 --> 01:27:58,814
- I
- want to live to watch

1874
01:27:58,838 --> 01:28:01,014
Sky wear red lipstick one day.

1875
01:28:01,145 --> 01:28:03,452
I want her to be
one of those women.

1876
01:28:03,582 --> 01:28:04,862
I'll tell her she
deserves to be.
