1
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,772
Now I lay me down to sleep.

2
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,008
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

3
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,677
Pop, I guess you're up there
in heaven...

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,515
so you know
I'm a little nervous.

5
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,612
Tomorrow's my first day
of college.

6
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,555
I really wish you were here.

7
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,524
And, Pop, about that party...

8
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,652
You were right to whup my ass.

9
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:07,755
This final exam is truly
an extraordinary piece of work.

10
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,819
This student has succinctly
summarized everything...

11
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,195
he's learned here
at this university...

12
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,392
Nothing!

13
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,097
You fucked up!

14
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,040
Christopher,
you've wasted your mind...

15
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:26,774
and a mind
is a terrible thing to waste.

16
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,577
Do you know what your punishment
is going to be?

17
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,808
The Deans...

18
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,513
of Discipline!

19
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,555
And we're gonna kick
your fuckin' ass.

20
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,988
Help!

21
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,497
No. Me, Play.

22
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,906
Are you having a nightmare?

23
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,842
You been keeping me up
all night.

24
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,310
What the hell's wrong?

25
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,406
It was for real.

26
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,409
I dreamed I was in college.

27
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,151
I messed up real bad.

28
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,748
See? A nightmare, man.
That's your sign.

29
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,257
You shouldn't go.

30
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,425
Listen.

31
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,021
Boy, I'm trying to make you
a responsible person.

32
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,691
Damn, I'm late.

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,331
You know something?

34
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,306
You'd forget your dick
if it wasn't screwed on.

35
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,571
I'm sorry.
I'm just running late.

36
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,776
You know, I'm really gonna
miss this place.

37
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,115
After Pops died, I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

38
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,850
You're the most disorganized
human being I know.

39
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,558
Your folks were great
for letting me stay here.

40
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,891
Yo, man, you don't gotta go.

41
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,362
The way we kicked it at
the community center last week...

42
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,299
We had the girls screaming.
The skins were in.

43
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,530
- You want to watch the car?
- It was hype, I guess.

44
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,697
I don't understand what's going
on with this college thing.

45
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,536
Who knows who could have been
at the center that night?

46
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,099
One of those talent scouts...
You know, for them producers?

47
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,371
We could get paid.

48
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,946
Not every successful person
went to college.

49
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,475
Play, you know I promised Pops.
Why you sweatin' me, man?

50
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,316
Oh, I gotta go get my picture.

51
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,017
I'll get your picture.
Just straighten up.

52
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,217
You're making me look bad.

53
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,753
I couldn't sleep last night.

54
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,095
Our first day of college.
Can you believe it?

55
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,294
I couldn't sleep last night,
either.

56
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,700
You sure you still want to go?

57
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,035
Kid, what are you talking about?
This is a whole new world.

58
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,267
New people, new experiences.

59
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,333
A roommate.
She's an upperclassman.

60
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,005
I can't wait to meet her.

61
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,638
Yeah, new rules.

62
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,807
No curfew.

63
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,841
You do plan to learn something,
don't you?

64
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,012
Yeah, I guess.

65
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,851
I'm gonna be late
for my grandma...

66
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,323
and you are gonna be late
for the church.

67
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,757
I'll see you on campus.

68
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,928
Oh, oh, before you go...

69
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,123
It's just a little something...

70
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,030
a little something
I wanted to give you.

71
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,730
Let those guys at college
know whose girl you are.

72
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,069
This is so nice. Thank you.

73
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,266
See you later.

74
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,819
Ain't you giving me something
to let people know I'm your man?

75
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,749
We're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

76
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,725
When I was in the house,
I was just thinking.

77
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,890
What, Play?

78
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,958
Is school really worth
breaking up a team like we got?

79
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,367
What are you talking about?

80
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,563
Could you keep your feet
on the mat?

81
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,764
Oh, sorry.

82
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,253
This is a great day
for First Corinthians Church.

83
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,088
- Amen.
- Amen.

84
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,390
A great day for this community.

85
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,855
But most important, a great day
for young Christopher.

86
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,194
We are very proud of you.

87
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,271
You have suffered the tragic
loss of your father...

88
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,369
but you have not lost your way.

89
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,541
We are proud because
you have taken the high road...

90
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,710
and not the low road...

91
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,151
unlike some
of our other youngsters...

92
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,086
who shall remain nameless.

93
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,383
Today...

94
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,018
we are sending one young man...

95
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,722
from this fortress of Jesus
to a citadel of higher learning.

96
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,928
So...

97
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,332
In honor of his father

98
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,302
Who was loved by this church

99
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,836
Christopher Robinson Jr.

100
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,240
Why don't you come on up?

101
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,786
I want to thank all of you...

102
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,195
for making it possible for me
to go to college.

103
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,356
That was my pop's dream.

104
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,968
I know if he were here,
he'd be very proud of me...

105
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,472
and very grateful to all of you
for putting your trust in me.

106
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,441
I won't let you down.

107
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,489
Sheila, they just rolled in.
Yeah, cool.

108
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,193
I think everything's gonna
just go smooth.

109
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,039
What are we doing at your job?

110
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,837
I thought you took the day off
to drive me to school.

111
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,605
A little surprise for my man.

112
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,407
What?

113
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,473
Not what, who,
and if I told your ass...

114
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,042
it wouldn't be a surprise,
so do me a favor...

115
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,145
and come on.

116
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,715
Wait a minute.
What about my stuff?

117
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,887
Kid, it'll be OK.
I don't see the junk man coming.

118
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,159
Oh, that's real funny, Play.

119
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,563
Just 'cause you got a ride
named ForPlay...

120
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,625
don't mean you gotta start
dissing my shit.

121
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,068
ForPlay... What kind of name
is that for a car, anyway?

122
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,264
Just come on.

123
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,097
Hold up. My scholarship check.

124
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,412
She's the one
that discovered The Boyz.

125
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,048
- For real?
- Word.

126
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,083
Her scout was in the house
at the community center.

127
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,958
She can get us in the studio...

128
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,520
even get us a phat record deal.

129
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,862
Don't blow this for me, man.
Come on.

130
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,868
Yeah, my eight o'clock.

131
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,166
- Good. Thank you.
- Didn't I give you inventory?

132
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,330
Get to work.

133
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,703
Kid 'N Play.

134
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,230
Sheila Landreaux.

135
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,708
Rick played me the tape
you sent.

136
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,178
Rick... That's her talent scout.

137
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,613
All the big names have scouts.
Remember that.

138
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,618
And, frankly,
I got very excited.

139
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,949
And I've heard a lot of stuff.

140
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,451
But that's yesterday's news.

141
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,287
Today's headline...

142
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,519
is "Kid 'N Play."

143
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,221
Gentlemen...

144
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,662
I'm willing to make
a commitment to you...

145
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,930
if you're willing
to make a commitment to me.

146
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,333
She's ready to commit.

147
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,304
Wait a minute.
What do you mean by "commit"?

148
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,467
I'm willing to commit...

149
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,238
in financing
and producing your demo...

150
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,744
and you...

151
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,407
will commit
at every waking moment...

152
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:46,043
in taking Kid 'N Play
to the top of the charts.

153
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,814
Look, I can't do this.

154
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:48,979
Wait a minute. What's going on?

155
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,114
Let me talk to him, please.

156
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,689
Kid, what do you mean you can't?

157
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,660
I can't do this and school.

158
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,526
You gonna kick this to the curb
for school?

159
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,396
With the money we could make,
you could buy your own school.

160
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,492
Look, you saw all those people
in the church.

161
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,935
And Pops... I can't let them down.

162
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,097
Excuse me.

163
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,901
Maybe I could talk to your dad.

164
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,467
- Maybe she could talk...
- Look, I don't think so.

165
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,341
Kid, listen.

166
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,539
Sheila, wait a minute.

167
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,740
Fuck!

168
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,377
Here we are.

169
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,147
Oh, yes. Join the Mardi Gras.

170
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,654
Come on.

171
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,516
What's up with the soldiers?

172
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,790
Come on, Kid, man,
this ain't your style.

173
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,263
Oh, yes, boogie fever.

174
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,629
That's a fraternity.

175
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,538
Well, maybe that I can get with.

176
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,200
What's up with her clothes, man?

177
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,937
Look how involved everybody is.

178
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,171
Look.

179
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,114
Look at all this school spirit.

180
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,584
What's up with the pigs?

181
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,891
Yo, watch the car.

182
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,161
Thanks for helping.

183
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,100
Yo, just watch the car.

184
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,661
You're just mad
about the record deal.

185
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,333
No, I'm mad about you
fucking up the finish.

186
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,239
You gonna get ill,
or you gonna help?

187
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,676
You wanted to be Joe College...

188
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,304
you be Joe College.

189
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,798
Yo, G, hold up.
I'll be with you in a minute.

190
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,835
Yo, what up, black?

191
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,364
What's going on, man?
Name's Jamal.

192
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:54,106
Why you buggin', man?
'Cause I'm white?

193
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,706
Yo, you want some bean pie?

194
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,886
Rick, we've run into
a serious problem here.

195
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,913
We have half of a fabulous team.

196
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,424
Unless, uh...

197
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,926
Unless that's all we need.

198
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,459
I can do the session.

199
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,058
I can do it.

200
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,399
But it was both of you
on the tape.

201
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,733
Whoa, wait a minute now.

202
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,831
I'm the one who came up
with the whole Kid 'N Play idea.

203
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,341
I wrote all the lyrics.

204
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,742
The only thing that guy ever did
was just put his name first.

205
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,270
I don't know about this.

206
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,842
Sheila, my take on this,
Play's on the money.

207
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,443
Sounds like
he's the driving creative force.

208
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,647
Then let's do it.

209
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,522
Look, look, look.

210
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,182
Let me see this.

211
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,626
Isn't it cute?

212
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:46,222
I know you don't think this
is what college is all about.

213
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,893
No. It was a gift from a friend.

214
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,663
Besides, what's wrong with it?

215
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,829
Nothing.

216
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,498
When I first got here,
I had a drawer...

217
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,667
full of little boy-toy
fru-frus just like that.

218
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,006
So, what happened?

219
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,806
I grew up.

220
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,836
I let my consciousness evolve.

221
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,645
And when I left all that
male materialism behind...

222
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,312
I began to see things in a more
politically correct light.

223
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,450
You do like boys, don't you?

224
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,855
I like men, girl.

225
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,018
Thousands of them.

226
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,755
No, I'm just kidding.
I like men...

227
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,730
but I don't need one
to define me.

228
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,891
And any woman who wants
to define herself...

229
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,798
by herself and for herself...

230
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,462
just has to free herself...

231
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,495
of all that tired, lame,
male bullshit.

232
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,835
Pick a color.

233
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,634
Any color.

234
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,912
Male bullshit.

235
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,718
Excuse me.

236
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,895
Bilal's in the house!

237
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,193
Hook me up!

238
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,466
Hi. My name is Play.

239
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,969
I'm the manager here.

240
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,197
I couldn't help but notice...

241
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,038
that you seem to be looking
for something, um...

242
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,273
Selena. I'm just browsing.

243
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,372
Well, if there's anything
in particular you need...

244
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,647
anything at all,
don't hesitate to come see me.

245
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,914
I won't.

246
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,849
That was real cute.
Now hook me up, man.

247
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,952
Bilal, I cannot keep giving you
your own personal discount.

248
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,293
Play, you ain't looking
at the big picture, man.

249
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,663
I need these records, 'cause
I'm working on some scratches...

250
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,463
for our demo session.

251
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,471
What do you mean
"our" demo session?

252
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,996
Let's check out
the psychology department.

253
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,969
Ooh, this one sounds good.

254
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,742
"Social Psychology
of Black Awareness.

255
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,305
"Psych 222."

256
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,480
God, it is so hard
to figure out what to do...

257
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,420
What are you doing?

258
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,515
I'm trying to get a closer look
at the catalog.

259
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,788
Yeah, right. You're not even
paying attention.

260
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,260
Am too.

261
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,819
Look. "Psych 100.

262
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,922
"Human Sexuality."

263
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,662
I hope that's not the only thing
you're interested in.

264
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,930
Of course not.

265
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,633
I'm interested in your mind
as well as your body.

266
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,436
Now, you need to put
a check by that, uh...

267
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,413
humping and hauling course.

268
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,608
That's Hubble and Hawking.

269
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,242
Whatever. Check that one.

270
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,549
Get off, get off, get off.

271
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,183
Stop playing.
We have to be serious now.

272
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:30,685
Damn, Play, don't you know shit
about the music business?

273
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,756
Look, when a MC cuts a record...

274
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,394
the DJ is the producer...

275
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,461
because the DJ...

276
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,099
is the one who made
your sorry ass what it is...

277
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,268
from the motherfucking giddyap.

278
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,868
Now hook me up, thank you.

279
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,641
Nice sales pitch.
Twenty dollars.

280
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,445
Twenty dollars? I thought
you was gonna hook me up.

281
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,610
Bilal, for fifteen cuts...

282
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,212
I should be charging your ass
a house note...

283
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,950
and would you get
from around my counter?

284
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,116
I'll bust that ass.

285
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,284
I don't think so.

286
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,452
Get these boxes out.

287
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,889
I'm Mrs. Deevers.
I'm here for the job.

288
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,333
How you doing, Mrs. Deevers?

289
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,395
The job requires
a lot of heavy lifting.

290
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,339
Oh, it's not for me.

291
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,534
It's for my boys.

292
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,701
Your boys?

293
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,075
Bring your ass in here!

294
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,579
Come on in here now!

295
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,739
Yo, look!

296
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,544
Right now, here.

297
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,210
That's that punk Play.

298
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,411
Where's Kid?

299
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,018
These three rap stars,
they got a rap group...

300
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,992
and if they could work
in your shop here...

301
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,689
maybe some big-time producer
would give them a break.

302
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,220
Oh, they got the tapes.

303
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,198
Do that rap thing
y'all do at home.

304
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,997
Yo, Mama,
we ain't auditioning for him.

305
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,162
Not this punk.

306
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,671
We ain't auditioning for him.

307
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,569
I said do the rap!

308
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,075
All right.

309
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,839
Kick the rap, man.

310
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,676
On and on, on,
and on, on, and on

311
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,113
Like hot butter on...
Say what?

312
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,411
Popcorn

313
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,441
Dibby dibby die, so-socialize

314
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,578
Clean out your ears,
open up your

315
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,882
Eyes

316
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,354
Now, well, maybe so

317
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,516
I don't think so

318
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,081
Well, funky ass

319
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,753
Mmm

320
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,193
What up with that?

321
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,628
That's kind of wack.

322
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,925
That didn't even rhyme.

323
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,762
Yo, man, y'all be...

324
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,392
Excuse me, Mrs. Deevers.

325
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,097
I'm sorry, but the job
has been filled.

326
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,503
Right, Bilal?

327
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,071
You got twenty dollars
I can borrow?

328
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,907
Bilal.

329
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,810
I would appreciate it.

330
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,372
Thank you. Sorry, guys.

331
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,978
The job's all filled,
but loved the rap.

332
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,614
Don't stand there
like a pile of dog shit!

333
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,351
Move it, move it!

334
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,756
Get on out!

335
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,324
Yo, I saved your ass.

336
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,733
I should charge you
the whole motherfucking store.

337
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,464
Thanks for buying these records.

338
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,204
Hey, yo, money, if the sister
won't cut you no play...

339
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,543
you got to assert yourself.

340
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,276
What do you know about sisters?

341
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,443
I know I like a fat booty.

342
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,578
And just 'cause the sister
be sweatin' you...

343
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,111
about getting positive on
the politically correct tip...

344
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,250
don't mean that she kickin'
the nasty to the curb.

345
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,227
- Jamal, do me a favor.
- What?

346
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,728
Talk white.

347
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,261
Will you be paying
your registration fees...

348
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,269
with cash, check,
or credit card?

349
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,429
What?

350
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,597
Cash, check, or credit card?

351
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,764
What?

352
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,036
Will you be paying with cash,
check, or credit card?

353
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,039
My check!

354
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:52,923
ForPlay.

355
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,996
What is this?

356
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,473
He signed it.
It's like cash.

357
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,737
Always losing shit.
If his dick wasn't screwed on...

358
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,266
he'd leave that shit, too.

359
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,644
Of course
I don't socialize with them.

360
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,080
Hey, wait.

361
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,013
Tell Father I played
four sets of tennis...

362
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,214
with Professor Vernault.

363
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,851
Give me that phone,
you selfish punk.

364
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,193
No, it's my phone.
You can't have it.

365
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,968
My father gave that to me.
I'll report you.

366
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,004
Selena, right?

367
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,879
Play, am I really
gonna sing backup on your demo?

368
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,248
You can have
any damn thing you want.

369
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,848
Excuse me.

370
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,058
Who is it?

371
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,583
Oh, Kid, chill out, man.

372
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,220
Don't worry about it.

373
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:02,063
Your scholarship money
is as good as in the bank.

374
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,728
It's in there. Bye.

375
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,844
Hey, yo, Sidney, Zora.

376
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,779
Hey, Kid. Hey, Jamal.

377
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,145
Hey, what's up?

378
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,548
Um, I'm over here.

379
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:24,147
Taking Afro-American Studies:
Consciousness of the Sixties.

380
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,020
Just imagine, you and I...

381
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,549
exploring the roots
of blackness together.

382
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,687
Kid, I'm not taking it.

383
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,256
I couldn't fit it
into my schedule this semester.

384
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,927
Kind of at the last minute...

385
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:41,531
I decided that I really,
really wanted to take...

386
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,507
Male Mythology:
A Feminist Perspective.

387
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,512
Right. Anyway...

388
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,606
I hope you enjoy
Consciousness of the Sixties.

389
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,674
Zora says
the professor's really great.

390
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,652
Very good. You'll like him.

391
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,711
Damn.

392
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,280
"Zora says the professor's
really great."

393
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,552
Zora says take this course.

394
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,025
Zora says
take three steps forward.

395
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,028
Zora says take three steps back.

396
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,622
Just because Zora says it,
doesn't mean she have to do it.

397
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,326
Hey, you got played, yo.

398
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,036
The perfect job for my boys.

399
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,299
Stop pushing me!

400
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,671
Get your butts
into that employment office.

401
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,007
Get in there! I don't care
what your sorry ass...

402
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,342
Malcolm X.

403
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,411
Everybody knows
what Malcolm was about, right?

404
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,712
Right.

405
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,647
He must have been important.

406
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,851
'Cause you can go into any
shopping mall in the country...

407
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,487
and buy a T-shirt
with his picture on it...

408
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,623
right next
to the Ninja Turtles T-shirts.

409
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,436
But what do we really know
about Malcolm?

410
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,495
We know he was a Muslim...

411
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,871
who made a pilgrimage
to Mecca...

412
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,873
and returned to America
a changed man...

413
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,811
with a changed philosophy.

414
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:03,817
Now, if you were printing
that philosophy on a T-shirt...

415
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,979
what would it say?

416
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,816
Mr. Robinson.

417
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,101
Malcolm X's philosophy?

418
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,371
On a T-shirt?

419
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,868
I'm happy you asked me
that question.

420
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,175
I'll be even happier
when you answer it.

421
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,254
OK, see, uh...

422
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,486
Malcolm X was pro-black...

423
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,015
very pro-black.

424
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,959
And in his pro-blackness...

425
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,124
he believed
that the white man...

426
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,565
in his pro-whiteness...

427
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,503
was not very pro-black.

428
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,937
Yo, man, stop bullshittin'.

429
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,335
Class...

430
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,438
I think Mr. Robinson
wants to know...

431
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,778
if you can say...

432
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,675
white-devils.

433
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,557
Why don't we hear
from one of these white-devils?

434
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,422
Maybe the one
sitting next to you...

435
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,622
and I know I'm scared of you,
Mr...

436
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,560
Johnson. Jamal Johnson.

437
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,463
Are you familiar
with what Malcolm X believed...

438
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,975
when he returned from Mecca?

439
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,576
Malcolm embraced
the brotherhood of all men.

440
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,208
Yo, word to the mother.

441
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,845
Congratulations, Mr. Johnson.

442
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,354
Unlike Mr. Robinson...

443
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,721
you obviously did
your preclass reading.

444
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,791
I won't see you
in summer school.

445
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,566
Sheila, what's wrong? Get away.

446
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,625
Baby, what's wrong?

447
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,495
He cleaned me out.

448
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,597
Who?

449
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,766
Who, baby?

450
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,605
Rick, that's who.

451
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,270
But what? What happened?

452
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,212
He took everything
he could get his hands on...

453
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,511
for gambling debts.

454
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,383
I don't know why
I ever trusted him.

455
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,545
But, listen, forget about him.

456
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,111
Are you going to be OK?

457
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,555
Baby, are you going to be OK?
Talk to me, woman.

458
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:23,220
Play, I'm so sorry.
I can't do the session.

459
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,489
I don't have the money...

460
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,430
and the worst part is,
MCA is waiting for the record.

461
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,627
Without it, we're nowhere, Play.

462
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,193
Dang. Look, if I get my hand
on the motherfucker...

463
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,363
I'll pop a cap in his ass.

464
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,531
Baby, talk to me.

465
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,733
What do you need?
Where does he live?

466
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,207
I'm your man. Talk to me.

467
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,403
Bilal, would you please
shut the fuck up?

468
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,974
Listen, if I had the cash,
I'd front the session myself.

469
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,382
Is there anywhere
you can get the money from?

470
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,252
All we need is to raise
the deposit for the studio...

471
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,915
and we can still
do the session...

472
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,948
and my accountant
is getting me liquid again.

473
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,482
But I'm completely busted.

474
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,791
If you hadn't put all your money
in that pussy mobile...

475
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,296
we wouldn't be in this shit.

476
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,958
Play, you don't understand.

477
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,762
This is our future at stake.

478
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:08,901
I have a check,
but it's made out to Kid.

479
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,306
He did sign it,
so I guess it's as good as cash.

480
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,776
- I'll take it.
- Wait.

481
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,938
That's perfect.
I won't even cash it.

482
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,572
Wait, wait.

483
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,014
Aw, damn.

484
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,573
Kid's check?

485
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,108
Yo, Play, that's fucked!

486
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,677
The boy needs a education.

487
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,283
Yo, Play, that's fucked.

488
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,792
Hey, man, you need to get
with the program.

489
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,625
Buy the books,
do the reading... End of problem.

490
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,823
You turkey.

491
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,355
Hey, take it easy!

492
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,958
Hey, guys, I smell something.

493
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,936
Do you smell something?

494
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,301
I smell pussy!

495
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,566
Yo, hold up.

496
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,301
This is black men using
their power of authority...

497
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,569
against another brother.

498
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,076
Yo, black, this ain't correct.

499
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,703
What's up with that?

500
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,680
Yo, who is this man,
your girlfriend?

501
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,477
Yo, what you want, man?

502
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,915
Wait a minute.

503
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,441
What are you guys doing here?

504
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,181
What are we doing here?

505
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,347
What up with that?

506
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,084
Motherfucker's in college,
and he can't read.

507
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,252
This means any time we want to,
we can fuck you right up.

508
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,091
Yo, and right now,
I definitely feel it.

509
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,120
Hey, Zilla, you feel it, man?

510
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,257
I feel it right now, man.

511
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,995
You really feel it?

512
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,468
What does he mean?

513
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,130
Tell these two motherfuckers
what time it is.

514
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,162
It's time to kick
their fucking ass!

515
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,071
Yeah! Come here!

516
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,336
Motherfucker.

517
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,307
A hundred
and twenty-three dollars?

518
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,476
For books?

519
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,714
Tell me about it.

520
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,117
I'm spending so much on books...

521
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,748
I won't be able to afford
a trip home until spring.

522
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,156
So, where's home... Japan?

523
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,524
No. Texas.

524
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,652
Where's yours, Africa?

525
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,393
Stupid, huh?

526
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,968
No big thing.

527
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,029
Bad check. Bad check.

528
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,705
It declined your check.

529
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,336
You're going to have to go
to the finance office...

530
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,472
to straighten it out.

531
00:26:56,514 --> 00:27:00,006
Don't worry.
It happens all the time.

532
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,631
Can I help you?

533
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,867
Time waits for no man!

534
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,643
They told me down the hall
I'd have to see Dean Kramer.

535
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,918
Don't let him sweat you,
my brother.

536
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,146
Maintain.

537
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,325
So...

538
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,555
Christopher...

539
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,829
before I get started,
I want you to know...

540
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,128
this isn't a racial thing.

541
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,498
What isn't a racial thing, sir?

542
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,505
The fact that your
tuition check bounced.

543
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,134
My tuition check bounced?

544
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,575
Now, this isn't a black thing.

545
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,841
It's a deadbeat thing.

546
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,111
I have to take your student I.D.

547
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,648
Deadbeat! Deadbeat! Deadbeat!
Deadbeat! Deadbeat!

548
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,457
Deadbeat!

549
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,594
If you don't pay your tuition
by the end of the week...

550
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,162
I'm going to have
to kick you out of here.

551
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,106
Stand up, please.

552
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:39,347
Good-bye, Christopher.
Have a nice day.

553
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,045
Don't forget...

554
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,146
Time waits for no man!

555
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,520
Peace.

556
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,991
Where is my money?

557
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,893
Kid, you got to promise me
you're not going to ill.

558
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,490
Come on, Kid.

559
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,023
I'm not going to ill.

560
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,899
Sheila has your money.

561
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,461
What?

562
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,972
I'll tell you what he said.

563
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,303
Sheila got your money, man.

564
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,708
Kid, you promised you wasn't
going to ill on me, man.

565
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,048
Look, see?
I told him not to do it.

566
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,746
I said, "Kid needs his money.

567
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,255
"The boy needs an education."
But no.

568
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,723
I said, yo, when you find out,
you going to whup that ass...

569
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,193
and that's what you gonna do...
Whup that ass.

570
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,059
Bilal, shut the fuck up.

571
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,825
Whatever.

572
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,594
Let me ask you this:

573
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,828
Why does Sheila have my money?

574
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,962
I'm glad you asked that, Kid.

575
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,131
Um, see, your money's safe.

576
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,108
Um, Rick...
You remember Rick, right?

577
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,508
Yeah, well, he was a snake.

578
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,739
He stuck her up for the money,
and she couldn't do my record.

579
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,748
- Your record?
- Yeah.

580
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,340
Kid, he dissed you, man.

581
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,975
Look, whup his ass!

582
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,283
Listen, the only ass that's
going to get whupped is yours!

583
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,447
I don't think so.

584
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,615
Oh, you...

585
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,057
Um, listen, you wanted
to be Joe College, right?

586
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,754
And I just needed the check...

587
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,356
as a deposit down
on the session so that, um...

588
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,164
by the time her accountant
liquidates all her assets...

589
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,227
That's right,
liquidates all her assets...

590
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,399
that we would get the money
back tomorrow at the session...

591
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,738
and it'll make sense to you
once you know the business.

592
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,141
Let me make it make sense!

593
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,203
Your money is gone, man!

594
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,544
He fucked you
and didn't even kiss you!

595
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,950
See? Studio, ride.

596
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,288
Ride, studio.

597
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,657
Yo, no!

598
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,219
Yo, I'm telling you, man,
ain't no studio in there.

599
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,924
No, yo, that shit is gutted out.

600
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,456
I'm telling you,
it's a fucking front, man.

601
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,561
Do Me Records.
What can I do for you?

602
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,540
Sounds like you could do a lot,
but anyway, my name is Play.

603
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,543
Uh, yo, and this is the...

604
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,636
his producer.

605
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,614
Um, Sheila Landreaux,
she's expecting me.

606
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,445
Sheila who?

607
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:53,711
See, I knew it.

608
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,616
Oh, this... Get off me.

609
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,621
- Shut up.
- What?

610
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,781
I'm sorry. Not you.

611
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,688
But listen, Sheila Landreaux...

612
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,694
and my name is Play,
and I'm here to cut a record.

613
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,559
Sorry. Never heard
of Landreaux or Play...

614
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,395
so there's no way Do Me
is doing shit for you today.

615
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,197
Yo, she fucked you, man...
Yo, with your money, Kid.

616
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,602
Didn't I tell you when I tried
to tell you that in there?

617
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,629
Yo, let's just go.
I was trying to tell him.

618
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,670
So, Play, when are we going
to record our record?

619
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,679
Your record?
I'm here to cut my record.

620
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,907
What the fuck
are y'all talking about?

621
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,778
Who the fuck
you talking to like that?

622
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,283
Yo, chill, chill.

623
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,184
Yo, man, fuck your record...
Our record.

624
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,188
Sheila Landreaux
gave you our money...

625
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,213
for our recording session
to make our record.

626
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,021
You know what I'm saying?

627
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,720
Y'all know Sheila?

628
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,989
Wait a minute.

629
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,520
She said he has your money
for your recording session?

630
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,032
You damn right.

631
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,931
Well, excuse me. Damn.

632
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:47,369
You know, it sounds
like she fucked all of youse.

633
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,895
What the...

634
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,101
Shit, they're taking her car!

635
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,905
Halt! Assume the position!

636
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,312
Looks like we nailed the
purloined Porsche perpetrators.

637
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,476
And they're all black.

638
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,008
What a surprise!

639
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,014
Hands up!

640
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,249
I want you victims of crime
to remember in the future...

641
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,728
not to give money
to any beautiful woman...

642
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,231
by the name
of Sheila Landreaux...

643
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,665
a.k.a. Shareese Taylor...

644
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,896
a.k.a. Sharnelle Butler...

645
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,929
a.k. a...
Well, I think you got the idea.

646
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,998
You...

647
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,568
you and you,
this is your lucky day.

648
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,170
Beat it! Get out of here.

649
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,407
You hurting me, man.

650
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,881
Oh, shit.

651
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,750
OK, you three guys
are going for a ride downtown.

652
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,913
What the fuck for?

653
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,081
What up with this?

654
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,248
Hands down!

655
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,848
Car theft, larceny...

656
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,359
mail fraud, embezzlement...

657
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,519
Damn!

658
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,529
I'm going to tell you like this.

659
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,791
I hope you ain't getting
no pussy...

660
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,924
'cause that shit
could be lethal, man.

661
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,892
Bilal, would you just
do me a favor and shut up?

662
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,631
Would you just shut the fuck up?

663
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,970
Yo, Play, the bitch has
a record longer than my dick.

664
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,635
Yo, can I ask you something?

665
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,041
Can I ask you something, please?

666
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,669
What?

667
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,580
You feel real stupid,
don't you, huh?

668
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,980
When are you gonna learn?

669
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,642
And look at this motherfucker.

670
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:09,983
Ass out...

671
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,921
No money, no education.

672
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,480
This shit got to stop. I'm...

673
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,887
How long?

674
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,293
Well, at least
I'm not the irresponsible one...

675
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,764
who left his check around
that I'd be tempted by it.

676
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,925
You know what I'm saying?

677
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,867
You...

678
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:28,831
Chill!

679
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,135
Yo, I was...

680
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,506
Yo, I was bullshit...
Yo, we boys.

681
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,033
We boys!

682
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,140
Shit.

683
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,910
Damn.

684
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,679
Yo, you know what I think?

685
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,515
Shut the fuck up, Bilal.

686
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,353
Yo, it ain't going
to be too many more...

687
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,291
of them shut-the-fuck-ups.
all right?

688
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,487
Because I'll whup
both of your asses.

689
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,554
You should talk
to the bank, man.

690
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,826
What are you talking about?

691
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,493
Your girl Sidney...

692
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,002
Her parents, they own minimalls.

693
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,028
I'm not asking Sidney for money.

694
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,539
Sidney, there's something
I got to talk to you about.

695
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,109
See... This is really difficult...

696
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,614
We been seeing each other
for over a year, and...

697
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,343
Well...

698
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,010
See, well...

699
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,212
You want to see other people?

700
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,319
Yo, I'm really fine about it.

701
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,483
But, wait, I didn't mean...

702
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,787
I'm fine about it.

703
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,260
I'm fine about it, too.

704
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,956
It's so funny.

705
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:29,023
We live closer to each other now
than we did at home...

706
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,299
and somehow,
we see less of each other.

707
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,100
Well, you know...

708
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,040
you have your classes,
and I have mine.

709
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,477
You're making new friends,
and I guess I am, too.

710
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,481
We're at college
to have new experiences, right?

711
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:45,982
Why should
we tie each other down?

712
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,584
I don't want to tie you down if
you don't want to be tied down.

713
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,145
Good...

714
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,788
'Cause I feel
the same way about you, too.

715
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,864
It's great that we feel
the same way about each other.

716
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,468
I guess I'll see you
around the campus...

717
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,034
buddy.

718
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,970
Yeah.
See you around campus, pal.

719
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,705
Sit down. I need to talk to you.

720
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,411
Listen, get your act together.

721
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,645
Keep your mind on them books
and off them gangs.

722
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,088
Hey, what up, man?

723
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,721
Damn, what's wrong with you?

724
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,459
Damn, man, you look like shit.

725
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,930
How could the best day
of my life...

726
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,062
and the worst day of my life
happen in the same week?

727
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,073
Yo, I ain't got the science
on that, black...

728
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,768
but what I do know is...

729
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:21,300
you better deal with Dean Kramer
and your financial situation...

730
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,939
before that situation
deals with you.

731
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,448
Better get off your behind.

732
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,247
Yo, I gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna check you later.

733
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,480
Peace.

734
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,318
Ah, brother Robinson.

735
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,486
I think I can help you out.

736
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,856
Come here.

737
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,422
Come on, brother.

738
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,070
Bottom line...

739
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,572
You don't have the snaps...

740
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,871
but you want Dean Kramer
to give you an extension...

741
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,036
till you figure out
what your next move is.

742
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,204
That's right.

743
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,873
Naw, see, that's fucked.

744
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,211
If you was a white boy...

745
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,409
he'd give you more extensions
than a bad weave...

746
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,179
but, a brother,
he ain't going to play that.

747
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,312
So, in other words, I'm over.

748
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,844
See, not necessarily.

749
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:09,183
See, my boy works
the main computer.

750
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,821
Now, cuz could lose
your paperwork for a while...

751
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,193
and buy you a little time.

752
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,357
For a price?

753
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,797
Hey, yo...

754
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,300
life's a bitch, homey...

755
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,997
and not always a fine bitch,
either.

756
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,164
Hello, Miles.

757
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,538
Well, hello yourself,
Professor Vernault.

758
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,703
Allow me to introduce you
to young Christopher Robinson...

759
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,337
a most promising freshman.

760
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,813
Professor Vernault...

761
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,316
is one of our most esteemed
scholars, Christopher.

762
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,818
Professor...

763
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,252
you know, I still find myself...

764
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,812
reflecting
upon our discussions...

765
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,824
of Chaucerian scatology.

766
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,758
Then you'll love
my upcoming lecture...

767
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,819
on the juxtaposition
of Thanatos and Eros...

768
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,023
in the works of Fielding.

769
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,396
Oh, wouldn't miss it, sir.

770
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,401
Well, I must be off, Miles.

771
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,870
Wow. That was deep.

772
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,005
Yo, you want
to whup the white man...

773
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,676
you got to know how to play
the white man's game.

774
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,708
- Hook me up.
- Wise decision.

775
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,984
Now, my boy usually charges
the football squad...

776
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,184
a couple hundred a head.

777
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,386
I don't have that kind of money.

778
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,395
Well, what you got, brother?

779
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,364
Come on, brother,
don't let this pass you by.

780
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,292
That's all the money
I have in the world.

781
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,460
I'll take it.

782
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,969
What is...

783
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,403
the single most
important question...

784
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,703
any of us can ask ourselves?

785
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,737
Who...

786
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,405
am I?

787
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,505
Late again.

788
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,177
My girl left me.

789
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,255
We've been taught that it's OK
to define ourselves...

790
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,985
in relationship
with others as...

791
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,151
What you doing, man?

792
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,785
...slave...

793
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,954
nanny...

794
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,759
athlete, or entertainer...

795
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,365
but never on our own terms
as individuals.

796
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:04,807
Ralph Ellison brilliantly
explored that theme...

797
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,174
in "The Invisible Man..."

798
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,735
which I can see...

799
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,771
that Mr. Robinson...

800
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:15,411
is most anxious
to discuss with us.

801
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,579
Come on, man, don't...

802
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,087
Mr. Robinson!

803
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,248
I am?

804
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,951
I am.

805
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,389
"The Invisible Man"...

806
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,523
A great book. A very great book.

807
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,897
Here we go again.

808
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,868
But I always wondered...

809
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,494
why did he call...

810
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,562
the invisible man...

811
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,130
the invisible man?

812
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:40,405
Everyone is on the edge
of their seats.

813
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,604
Why?

814
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,614
I think the author
was trying to say...

815
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,846
that black people...

816
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,583
are like that movie...

817
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,251
where the only way
you could see the guy...

818
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,919
is if he was...

819
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,428
wrapped in white bandages.

820
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,729
So Ellison...

821
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,329
was saying that...

822
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,141
in order for white society
to see us...

823
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,839
we must be wrapped in white?

824
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,107
Yeah.

825
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,848
I am.

826
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,080
Very insightful, Mr. Robinson.

827
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,248
You taught me something.

828
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,288
Could I see you after class?

829
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,486
You're through.

830
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,359
You wanted to see me, sir?

831
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,660
What I want to know is...

832
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,194
do you have the gift
that I think you have...

833
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,706
or am I just being charmed
by your line of bullshit?

834
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,548
Could I get back to you on that?

835
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,887
Yes, you can, in a week...

836
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,821
with a twenty-page paper...

837
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,222
in which you discuss
how Ellison, Wright, Baldwin...

838
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,852
and the other authors
I assigned to you to read...

839
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:08,331
handle the theme of growing up
as a black male in America...

840
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,394
In a week? Wait a minute.
That's not fair.

841
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:16,236
Life is not fair, Mr. Robinson.

842
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,740
There are students
on this campus who are here...

843
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,175
only because their parents
are rich alumni.

844
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,940
That isn't fair.

845
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,344
And those students
might look at you...

846
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,109
and think that the only reason
you're here...

847
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,744
is because you're black,
and you got a good jump shot...

848
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,550
or you're black, so you can run
with a football...

849
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,489
or you're just here
because you're black.

850
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,515
That isn't fair.

851
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,221
And it might not be fair
that you got to prove...

852
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,288
that you're here because
you've earned it, but you do...

853
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,199
and if you don't prove it to me,
Mr. Robinson...

854
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,230
I'll fail your ass.

855
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,608
Yo, you talk to Kid?

856
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:57,807
He hasn't even called me...

857
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,941
to find out how I'm feeling
after losing my record deal.

858
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,418
Play, it was wrong, man.

859
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,782
Fifteen dollars.

860
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,693
- We hook up later, right?
- All right, peace, man.

861
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,786
- Peace.
- Yo, peace out.

862
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:12,989
Later.

863
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,733
What's up with the extra ends?

864
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,427
Sometimes you got to pay
what you owe, right?

865
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,632
Later.

866
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,898
You're right.

867
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,314
A twenty-page paper to write.

868
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,014
All those authors.
It ain't gonna be easy.

869
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,816
You can't get in
without a student I.D.

870
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:41,984
What up with that?

871
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,517
Give it up, man.
Yo, here's some food.

872
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,629
Damn. What, you starving?

873
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:50,893
Thanks, Jamal.

874
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,835
No problem, man.

875
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,565
You know, without my I. D...

876
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:57,904
I can't get into the library
or the cafeteria.

877
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,706
Living by my wits isn't easy.
It's hard work.

878
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,474
Hard work? I haven't seen you
do any work yet.

879
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,775
You need to get off your butt...

880
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,716
and go down
to the faculty dining hall.

881
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,486
Word. Yo, free food,
the pay is correct...

882
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,753
but, yo, man, you better
make sure you come correct...

883
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,693
'cause to work for Mr. Lee...
You got to be all you can be.

884
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,060
Move it, move it, move it!

885
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,962
Loaded tray.

886
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,159
Do you know where Mr. Lee is?

887
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:30,666
Excuse me. Do you...

888
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,832
Out of the way, please.

889
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:35,671
Excuse me.

890
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,007
Move your ass.

891
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,682
Do you know where... Hey.

892
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,316
Look out. That's my foot.

893
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,419
Heads up.

894
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,400
All right,
so what's the holdup here?

895
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,733
You should've been out of here
fifteen minutes ago.

896
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,602
Do you know where Mr. Lee is?

897
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,301
Who wants to know?

898
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,338
You must be the new recruit.

899
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,775
You got to go to work, boy.

900
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,305
There's a pile of spuds
over there with your name on it.

901
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,251
Do a good job, boy,
and you'll be on your way...

902
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,915
to earning your kitchen
assistant first-class pin.

903
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,151
Yes, sir.

904
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,190
You forgot your cap.

905
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,824
Everybody got to wear the hat.

906
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,892
But it won't fit.
I'd look stupid.

907
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,699
Are you saying I look stupid?

908
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,205
No, no, sir.

909
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,366
Actually,
it looks kind of good on you.

910
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,875
Are you saying I look good...

911
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,809
with a damn plastic cap
on my head?

912
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,970
No, sir.

913
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,570
Then what are you saying, boy?

914
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,481
I have no idea.

915
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,711
Listen, son...

916
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,777
you want to stay
off my shit list...

917
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,448
put on the hat.

918
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,491
You look good.

919
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,395
If I lose this,
my dad will kill me.

920
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,963
Do you feel lucky?

921
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,533
I'm going for it, man.

922
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,602
Let's go, let's go, man.

923
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,706
Put your weight on it.

924
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,114
Gimme it, man!

925
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,586
Give me my money, man.

926
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,746
Give me... Thank you!

927
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,552
Fuck, man!
Thank you, man, thank you!

928
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,116
Freak, man, freak!
I'm a winner, man!

929
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,991
- Who's next?
- Me!

930
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,725
Scared money
don't make no money.

931
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:36,994
What's up, K-l-D?

932
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,468
Yo, Kid!

933
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,698
Jamal, watch the cash.

934
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,038
Kid, wait! Yo, man, whassup?

935
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,599
What are you trying to do to me?

936
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,372
Trying to raise you some dough.

937
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,506
By ripping off these people
I have to see every day?

938
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,846
OK, we'll kick Monte Carlo
night to the curb.

939
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,079
I'm forty-five minutes away,
and on my days off from work...

940
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,350
I can come up
and work on a new plan.

941
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,616
- Plan?
- Yeah.

942
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,624
Don't mention plan
in my presence.

943
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,592
I can't afford
any more of your plans.

944
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,770
You're gonna get your "A,"
mm-hmm.

945
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,779
You're gonna get your "A."

946
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,508
Girl, you're gonna get your "A,"
you hear me?

947
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,573
Oh! Oh, Play!

948
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,519
Uh, Kid.
Yo, man, I'm thinkin' hard.

949
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,476
"If you have
no confidence in self...

950
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,040
"you are twice-defeated
in the race of life.

951
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:04,645
"With confidence, you have won
even before you have started.

952
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,121
"Marcus Garvey."

953
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,915
Professor Sinclair?

954
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,358
What can I do for you,
Mr. Robinson?

955
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,792
My paper, sir.

956
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:53,234
Excuse the coffee stains.

957
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,433
I just wanted you to know
I worked really hard on it.

958
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,134
I quoted from your book...

959
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,609
which I must say
was really excellent.

960
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,548
I'll reserve judgment
on your paper, Mr. Robinson...

961
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,018
but...

962
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,783
as far as your
ass-kissing goes...

963
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,449
two thumbs up.

964
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,789
Why don't you roll the dice?

965
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,459
In your ass!

966
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,933
Chill, my brother.

967
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,494
I ain't your brother.

968
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:29,971
Ain't trying to cause no beef.

969
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,269
What are you doing?

970
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:34,800
Come on, why you go and do
something stupid like that?

971
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,143
Yo, milk,
do something about your boy.

972
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,943
That's it.

973
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,077
If your name isn't Kid or Jamal,
get out of my room!

974
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,281
Without even hearing my plan?

975
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,689
You managed to spare a little
time to come up with a plan?

976
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:51,455
Not any plan.
The plan of plans, you know?

977
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:54,020
Yo, think about it.
A house party.

978
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,224
A house party?

979
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,166
Yo, not just any house party.

980
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,862
The mother of house parties.

981
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,598
A pajama jammy jam.

982
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,532
Women in negligees...

983
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:06,132
Look at this. Mmm.

984
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,144
...get in free.

985
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,646
Brothers have got to pay.

986
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,148
All of the proceeds go...

987
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,150
to the Christopher Robinson
scholarship fund.

988
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,310
You, boy.

989
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,785
Don't worry about nothin'...

990
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,981
'cause I'm about
to take care of everything.

991
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,546
Yo, Kid.

992
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,888
I'm taking care of everything.

993
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,553
Let me get this straight.

994
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,255
You want a bunch
of college women...

995
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,423
to strip to their underwear,
come to my room...

996
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,160
so you can charge a bunch
of horny motherfuckers...

997
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,428
to be in there with them?

998
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,903
Ladies, six feet.

999
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,667
Wait a minute. Slow down, man.

1000
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,870
Not here.
In the faculty dining hall, man.

1001
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,434
All you gotta do is...

1002
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,968
get the key?

1003
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,342
Oh, no. Look, I'm not with it.

1004
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,816
Forget about it, all right?

1005
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,480
I'm not with it.

1006
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,184
Why's he flippin' on us?

1007
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,471
Kid, Kid, Kid.

1008
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,734
Boy, what you want?

1009
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:14,175
I borrowed this book
from Sidney.

1010
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,906
You can give it back to her.

1011
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,141
Now, you know
that's not Sidney's book.

1012
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,341
It's not?

1013
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,845
You're right. It's not.
My mistake.

1014
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,754
Yeah, that is your mistake.

1015
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,851
Coming around here with that
lame "Do me, baby" mentality...

1016
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,089
is another definite mistake.

1017
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,791
I'll tell you
what the mistake is.

1018
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:37,391
The mistake is you think
you know everything.

1019
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,699
You don't know me. You don't
know anything about me.

1020
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:44,002
Tell Sidney I asked about her,
and I hope she's doing OK.

1021
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,201
Please?

1022
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,207
What?

1023
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,307
Look, there's a rally
this afternoon.

1024
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,875
It's against the cutbacks
in the ethnic studies program.

1025
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:02,291
So if a man were looking for
Sidney, he might find her there.

1026
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,323
Knowledge is power!

1027
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,329
- What?
- Knowledge is power!

1028
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,734
Come on, sister.

1029
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,243
Now, if we allow
the administration...

1030
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:24,543
to cut back on ethnic studies...

1031
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,414
we will be letting them deny
the contributions...

1032
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,511
of all of our cultures
that made this country great.

1033
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,045
Knowledge is power!

1034
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,128
Come on, y'all.
Clap with me now.

1035
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,023
Listen here.

1036
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,592
Everybody wants to be a rebel

1037
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,432
Well, a rebel without a cause
can turn into a devil

1038
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,063
For a moment just take a pause

1039
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,334
So we can reach a lever

1040
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,170
To open up the doors,
eliminate the gap

1041
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,177
You're searching for
perfection in somebody else

1042
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,679
You sacrifice yourself
for his illegal wealth

1043
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,806
Living in the image
of a man what you are

1044
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,646
You're just another Jackie
who wants to be a star

1045
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:03,152
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm getting quite annoyed

1046
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,313
There was a brain
that had nothin', just a void

1047
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,516
Filled with
materialistic thoughts

1048
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,787
Of cars and dolls,
things you just bought

1049
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,953
Drugs people sold,
but I'm gonna rise like a tower

1050
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,293
Tellin' all the people
that it's time to devour

1051
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,595
you see, the future
that we live in is ours

1052
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,193
Because knowledge,
it is power

1053
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:20,999
Knowledge is power

1054
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,236
Check it out, intelligence
captivates my mind

1055
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,675
I'm gonna succeed with
my brain and not my behind

1056
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,770
'Cause I don't feel
that as a black woman

1057
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,805
I should give up the booty
if the boss thinks it's boomin'

1058
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,874
Or some people
who move up on others

1059
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,579
Like they own 'em
and they don't treat 'em equal

1060
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,282
Can't you see?
This is racist, racist, racist

1061
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,482
Where they chase us

1062
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,322
Away from knowing who we are
and where we came from

1063
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,453
I ain't stopping
until we gots this game on

1064
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:49,192
'Cause I know this is the hour
to make knowledge equal power

1065
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:50,893
Scream it, scream it

1066
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,094
Knowledge

1067
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:53,862
Is power

1068
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,204
Thank you.

1069
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,670
Right now I would like
to introduce our next speaker.

1070
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,873
Professor Sinclair.

1071
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,782
Thank you, Zora.

1072
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,915
As I stand here
and look at your...

1073
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:15,754
Zora, your performance
was moving.

1074
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,259
We need more people like you.

1075
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,727
I want you to call me.

1076
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,855
I think we can make you a star.

1077
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:24,958
You have the right to learn
about your heritage...

1078
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,992
and the heritage of others.

1079
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,938
Support ethnic studies.

1080
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,033
Knowledge is power!

1081
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,771
What's wrong, Sidney?

1082
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:38,975
Uh, nothing really.

1083
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,381
It's Kid, isn't it?

1084
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,249
I know he was at the rally.

1085
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,446
You know him?

1086
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,512
I met him at the dean's office.

1087
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,019
He was having some problems.

1088
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,259
Doesn't look too good.

1089
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,327
- Really?
- Yeah.

1090
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:54,853
That's too bad.

1091
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,994
He was going on
about his ex-girlfriend...

1092
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,763
and how they were breaking up...

1093
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,328
because she wasn't into
"givin' up the rhythm..."

1094
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,532
as he put it.

1095
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:08,366
But the more he said about her,
the more I knew...

1096
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,572
he didn't know what he had...

1097
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,741
and I had to meet her...

1098
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,148
because she sounded
like such a find.

1099
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,483
Damn, Miles!

1100
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,990
Give the child
some room to breathe.

1101
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,458
Zora...

1102
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,085
what a surprise.

1103
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,458
I should be going.

1104
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:29,658
Can I giv...

1105
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:32,694
Can l...

1106
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,098
Can I give you a call later?

1107
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,368
Yeah, please.

1108
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,581
All right.

1109
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:52,082
Oh, God. What do you think?

1110
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,987
He's so different from Kid.

1111
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,584
He's... he's mature,
he's sophisticated...

1112
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,253
he's an intelligent
conversationalist.

1113
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,559
Yeah. I see you two
were about to get into...

1114
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,326
a heavy conversation in French.

1115
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:06,699
Look, Sidney, different doesn't
necessarily mean better.

1116
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,330
Why don't you think about that?

1117
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,629
Dean Kramer's office called...

1118
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,461
and they want to see you
right away.

1119
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:43,832
This is a work study job...

1120
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,034
for students...

1121
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:51,173
and they say
you ain't no student!

1122
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:18,299
I thought you were supposed to
be hooking me up for the black.

1123
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,935
Yo, brother Robinson,
I'm working on it...

1124
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:25,346
but delicate situations such
as these sometimes take time.

1125
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,041
Dean Kramer, I was just...

1126
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,019
Leaving?

1127
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,453
Thank you, Miles.

1128
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,187
The deadline I gave you...

1129
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,992
for paying your tuition
has come and gone.

1130
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,362
And we do have a policy
of encouraging our students...

1131
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,836
be they black or white,
to pay their tuition.

1132
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,537
So, it's with great sadness
that I have to tell you...

1133
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:55,032
Dean Kramer, please,
just give me one more week.

1134
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,340
I promise I'll have the money.

1135
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,642
One more week.

1136
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,583
But if you don't have
the money by then...

1137
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,887
it really will be it!

1138
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,487
Time waits for no man!

1139
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,462
Why haven't you called me
about the recording session?

1140
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,024
You promised me
I could sing backup.

1141
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:21,332
Listen, Selena, don't sweat me!

1142
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,605
Don't sweat it. As soon as the...

1143
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:26,939
Excuse me.

1144
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,774
If the others don't succeed,
I got the twelve-inch you need.

1145
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,542
Clarence's Records. What up?

1146
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,449
When's the party?

1147
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,645
Tell him about the pajama party!

1148
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,677
I knew about this party,
and I don't even go to school!

1149
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,577
I want y'all to tell me
about this party.

1150
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,878
Everybody know about this party
but the three of you.

1151
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,440
Go out there
and find out about this party.

1152
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,112
Make your grandma proud!

1153
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,869
We can get you signed
in a heartbeat.

1154
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,779
- Really?
- No problem.

1155
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:40,942
What are you doing tonight?

1156
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,282
- There's a pajama party.
- We'll be there.

1157
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,321
I think it's a pajama party.

1158
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,885
And the rules
are very clear on that shit.

1159
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,988
"No university building
or other property...

1160
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,328
"may be used
as a meeting place...

1161
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,628
"or venue for entertainment...

1162
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,100
"without the express
authorization...

1163
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,329
"of the dean of the college."

1164
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,099
Very good, Stab.

1165
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:05,733
Now all we need to know is where
the party's gonna be at.

1166
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,681
All right, who was it?

1167
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,695
I don't think so.

1168
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,493
Check that out, man.

1169
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,901
Yo, for a midget white boy,
you all right, Jamal...

1170
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,842
sneakin' in the house
with the brothers.

1171
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,845
Yeah, you all right,
even though you try to flex.

1172
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:44,141
Can't play dice, though.

1173
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,374
Will you be quiet?

1174
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,610
Damn, Kid, calm down.

1175
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,813
You're getting white as a ghost,
and that's hard for you to do.

1176
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:51,979
Now, come on.

1177
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,181
All right, all right.

1178
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,818
Come on, come on, come on.

1179
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,701
I just want to remind everybody.
Let's be careful in there, OK?

1180
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,138
Would you relax?

1181
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,508
Careful!

1182
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,741
Y'all want to help me
with my equipment, please?

1183
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:19,941
Thank you.

1184
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,616
Yo, I swear if I gotta carry
this shit in by myself...

1185
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:26,019
I'll play the Village People
all fuckin' night.

1186
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,381
Yo, man, chill.
Don't go out like that.

1187
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:38,559
Who are you supposed to be,
Mrs. Kunta Kinte?

1188
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,664
I thought this outfit
was politically correct.

1189
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:43,831
You know, P.C.

1190
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,775
Well, it is P.C. if it stands
for "poor choice."

1191
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,278
Girl, why are you looking
like me instead of you?

1192
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,948
I don't know what I'm supposed
to look like anymore.

1193
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,508
I don't know what I'm supposed
to feel like anymore.

1194
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,448
I miss Kid,
but he needs to grow up.

1195
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,752
That's what you said, right?

1196
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:04,692
Now, don't go blaming
breaking up with Kid on me.

1197
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,160
You're the one
always talking about...

1198
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,925
how immature he is
with his "Do me" attitude.

1199
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:12,560
But it's not about what I think.
It's about what you think.

1200
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,536
What's in your head
and your heart.

1201
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,698
That's what being a strong woman
is all about, Sidney.

1202
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,642
This is Zora going to the party.

1203
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,441
I hope I see Sidney there.

1204
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,112
All the girls
kept talking about...

1205
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,951
was silk teddies
and sexy nightgowns.

1206
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:34,882
All clear! Let's go!

1207
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:38,189
- All right!
- Let's see some panties, boy!

1208
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,624
Girl, hurry your fat ass up!

1209
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,632
Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo

1210
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,541
I'm never, never, ever
gonna let you go

1211
01:01:58,181 --> 01:01:59,648
Brothers are ten each...

1212
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:02,344
women appropriately dressed...

1213
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,784
or should I say undressed...

1214
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,980
get in free.

1215
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,121
She crept into my heart

1216
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,355
At a funky time

1217
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,626
I met her once or twice

1218
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,133
I knew something was right

1219
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,101
I was hoping Sidney
would be here.

1220
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,797
Have you ever known Sidney
to miss a good party, man?

1221
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,135
She's gonna be here, man.

1222
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,504
If you see her,
just let me know, OK?

1223
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:28,032
I will, but go in there
and try and hit some skins.

1224
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,443
Pretty black hair
and big brown eyes

1225
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,142
Made my mouth so dry

1226
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,308
Should you be with her

1227
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,681
Excuse me.

1228
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,777
I don't know

1229
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:38,946
Pardon me.

1230
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,218
I tried to tell

1231
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,225
Yo, B, you got some cuties here.

1232
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,322
I'm doing the best I can

1233
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,091
What, what your papa said

1234
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,895
Boy, do things your way

1235
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,924
Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo

1236
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,732
Yo, baby, yo

1237
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,739
Never, ever,
ever gonna let you go

1238
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,606
I never, ever want to let you go

1239
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:01,576
Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo

1240
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:03,606
Hi, Patty!

1241
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,238
I'd love to,
but I had to let one go

1242
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,374
I had to let one go

1243
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,317
Love can make you blind

1244
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,118
I almost lost my mind

1245
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,216
I just know what I had to do

1246
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,888
Sidney, you know if any woman
gets in here for free, it's you.

1247
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,055
Yo, you ain't gotta...

1248
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,621
Yes, I do.

1249
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,030
We both do.

1250
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,226
You seen Kid?

1251
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,367
Last time I saw him,
he was lookin' for you.

1252
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,032
- Really?
- You got an eye problem?

1253
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:33,007
- Come on!
- Fool.

1254
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,873
Live all my days

1255
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,572
If one could

1256
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,603
She had all the right things

1257
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,946
Then she touched
the right places

1258
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,951
Now I'm in her world

1259
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,886
And I'm so confused

1260
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,253
No place for me

1261
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,884
- Yo, yo, Play, man.
- What? What's up?

1262
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,689
I think something's wrong
with the toilet, man.

1263
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,721
Dj vu like a motherfucker.

1264
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,392
Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo

1265
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,563
Yo, baby, yo

1266
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,301
Never, never, ever
gonna let you go

1267
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,741
I can't believe it.
I'll be able to stay in school.

1268
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,307
Sidney, you look incredible.

1269
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,811
Actually,
I was hoping you'd be here.

1270
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,051
It's like I told you before...

1271
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:19,520
if you ain't givin' up
the rhythm...

1272
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:20,715
the boy ain't interested.

1273
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,156
Let's dance.

1274
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:29,992
Ain't nobody here!

1275
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,632
Damn! Damn! Damn!

1276
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,665
Yo, man.

1277
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,408
What?

1278
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,913
Do you hear any music?

1279
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,006
No. What up with that?

1280
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,880
Yo, and there ain't
nobody here dancin'.

1281
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,478
Aw, shit!
And I wanna shake my ass!

1282
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,554
I don't know what you come to do

1283
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,661
I come to clap my hands

1284
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:02,027
I come to stomp my feet

1285
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,190
You want to dance, Sidney?

1286
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,358
No, I don't want to dance.

1287
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,630
- Come on.
- I don't want to dance.

1288
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,159
- Come on.
- No.

1289
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:11,833
Throw my feelings
out on the shelf

1290
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:13,734
Baby

1291
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,266
Come on.

1292
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,006
All right. All right.

1293
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:20,645
Don't make me laugh.

1294
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,245
Baby

1295
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,880
So let's gather
'round the peoples

1296
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,255
Let's have a funky party tonight

1297
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,887
But I've been down all day today

1298
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,297
Let's have a house party

1299
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,198
I don't know
what you're gonna do

1300
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,702
And I don't know
what you come to do

1301
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,606
I come to dance my steps

1302
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,111
I come to clap my hands

1303
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,676
Come on, girl, let's do this.

1304
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:56,276
And the bass is really pumpin'

1305
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,811
The groove
is funkin' hard as hell

1306
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,519
Baby

1307
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,753
And there's gotta be a honey

1308
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:08,230
At the party gonna treat me well

1309
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,856
Let's do this.

1310
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:11,025
That's all I gotta say

1311
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,661
But there's no one like my baby

1312
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:16,900
My baby knows just who she is

1313
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:19,732
Yeah, she knows,
she knows, she knows

1314
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,437
But no matter what the problem

1315
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,572
My cookie's gonna fix it,
you dig?

1316
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:31,614
See, 'cause I been down
too long today

1317
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,145
Let's have a house party

1318
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,350
Come on. Go, boys.

1319
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,185
So everybody bring
your dancin' shoes

1320
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,561
Let's have a house party

1321
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,566
I don't know what you come to do

1322
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,204
I come to clap my hands

1323
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,472
I come to stomp my feet

1324
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,103
I come to dance my steps

1325
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,807
I come to shout for peace

1326
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,946
I don't know what you come to do

1327
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,424
I come to clap my hands

1328
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,825
I come to do my steps

1329
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,523
I come to jump up and down

1330
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,326
Check it, check, check

1331
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,957
Gimme some of that cookie

1332
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,127
Mmm, gimme
some of that good thing

1333
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,166
That's what I said

1334
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:38,249
You heard the man,
give him some of that good thing

1335
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,358
Damn, ain't nobody here!

1336
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,957
Aw, shit!

1337
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,128
- Come on, Pee-Wee!
- Damn!

1338
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,968
Shit.
I just busted my ass.

1339
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:58,704
Hey, ladies!

1340
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,301
Lookie here,
it's ladies' choice...

1341
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,537
and we're going to slow it up...

1342
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,275
for all the beautiful
young ladies.

1343
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,247
It's ladies' choice, Sidney.

1344
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,915
Excuse me. I was here first.

1345
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:15,651
Step off, brother.

1346
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,522
Let Sidney make the choice.

1347
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,925
Wait a minute. She's my girl.

1348
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:22,260
Wait. I don't remember saying
I was anybody's girl.

1349
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,858
And you seem to have already
made your choice.

1350
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:26,828
What?

1351
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:28,063
Ta-ta.

1352
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,869
Mmm, you can look...

1353
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,637
but you better not touch.

1354
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:12,607
Zora, I want you to meet
my producer Miriam Mobuto.

1355
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,640
This is Zora Henderson,
a wonderful young talent.

1356
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,084
Oh, I could put my beer
on that booty!

1357
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,985
Could live in that ass!

1358
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,319
I gotta pass on that.

1359
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,882
You see, my brothers,
what you hold in your hands...

1360
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:27,225
is one of the many chains that
enslave the black man today.

1361
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,423
Think about it.

1362
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:32,798
Damn, vanilla
about to strike oil.

1363
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,427
There he goes, look at that!

1364
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:41,172
Yo, that's some jungle booty,
and I'm Tarzan.

1365
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,311
Yo, I know
where everybody's at, man!

1366
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:45,506
They in the library.

1367
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:54,952
Oh, damn! Chill!

1368
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,717
- We got enough yet?
- Uh-uh.

1369
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,922
What you mean, "Uh-uh"?
All that? Come on.

1370
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,056
- We ain't there yet.
- Aw, man.

1371
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,460
Yo, come up here!
Rack some shots, boys.

1372
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:10,904
Y'all look good down there.
I'm proud of you.

1373
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,135
Jamal, I didn't call "Jamal."
Excuse me, man.

1374
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,871
- Let me see the mic, man.
- Jamal, chill, all right?

1375
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:17,435
Bilal, think about it, man.

1376
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,504
He likes big booties, dice.

1377
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,516
He likes bean pie.
Sure, put him on.

1378
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,074
You probably got a big dick,
too, huh?

1379
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,552
A big tremendous white dick.

1380
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,723
Great show, Kid.

1381
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:30,852
Here I go

1382
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,654
I talk trips and zips
as I flip an enemy bird

1383
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,097
Suckers can't fake
the flavor candy like Nerds

1384
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,726
'Cause I made the track
react with a vengeance

1385
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,861
Scooping up more pigeons
and suckers with a vengeance

1386
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,338
Wild hip-hop, slip-shot,
I grab for my pistol

1387
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,705
'Cause I act strapped,
and this is what I call it

1388
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,142
'Cause when I got the mic,
I excites life, that's right

1389
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,169
In it with a pimp limp
sent to get hipper

1390
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:52,339
You're provoked, choked

1391
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:53,746
Now you're stumped
and stay lumped

1392
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:54,976
The J-A-S man

1393
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,350
I totally like dancin'
with the K-l-D and the P-L-A-Y

1394
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,615
And better believe
I sell tracks then

1395
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:02,123
I'm proud to be black,
and Y.B.T., we be maxin'

1396
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:05,490
The dopest action with the DJ,
the boogedy boogedy bing bang

1397
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,325
I slip shit, flip shit
with the hip-hop street slang

1398
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,628
I gots, 'cause I rock
the big groups, is that not?

1399
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,692
I hits the boots, 'cause
the hookers love the dreadlocks

1400
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,683
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

1401
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:31,379
We just dancin', y'all

1402
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,581
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

1403
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,920
Out there on the floor

1404
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,654
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

1405
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,218
We just dancin', baby

1406
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:43,561
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

1407
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:47,296
Gonna give you more

1408
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:50,828
Yeah

1409
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,307
Yo, Kid, check this out.
I'm about to reach out my soul.

1410
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:56,600
If you're lookin' for more,
step on the dance floor

1411
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,772
Check your coat
and your troubles at the door

1412
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,374
'Cause for sure,
you're gonna see a smile today

1413
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,385
The problems of the world
seem miles away

1414
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:05,148
The only thing that matters
is a good time

1415
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,451
That can be had
with the help of a good rhyme

1416
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,753
The DJ's hype,
more than up to par

1417
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,487
Uh-oh,
there goes a cutie at the bar

1418
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:14,087
- So I
- Strolled on over to say hi

1419
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:15,756
- I don't want any.
- Come on, just a little taste.

1420
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:16,924
It's a party.

1421
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,523
Dance a while

1422
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,159
I'll do anything
to see you smile

1423
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,693
You see,
my job is to take you higher

1424
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:25,366
After a couple of songs,
I'll require

1425
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:26,840
Having fun? Well, I ain't done

1426
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,172
The best is yet to come

1427
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,043
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

1428
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,672
We just dancin', y'all

1429
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:35,115
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

1430
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,811
Out there on the floor

1431
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,650
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

1432
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,519
We're just dancin', baby

1433
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,388
Ain't gonna hurt nobody

1434
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,594
Gonna give you more

1435
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,858
Baby,
let's get some refreshments.

1436
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,057
OK.

1437
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:07,143
What's the matter with you?
Come on, kick it.

1438
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,977
The music's hype,
and if it's all right with you

1439
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:13,044
I wouldn't mind spending
the rest of the night with you

1440
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:14,988
No kidding, baby,
we can make some noise

1441
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,854
You and your girls
and me and my boys

1442
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,554
Just feelin' right,
a night full of pleasure

1443
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,063
We can take it slow
with no pressure

1444
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:23,758
- Enough respect
- You won't regret

1445
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,632
This'll be a night
you won't soon forget

1446
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,226
And that's a promise
from me to you

1447
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,500
Take my hand, girl,
I'm gonna see you through

1448
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,598
You don't strike me
as a woman who fronts

1449
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,233
- Here's your chance
- You only live once

1450
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:37,074
I wanna hear you say,
oh, what a blast, Kid

1451
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:39,080
We sure had good fun
while it lasted

1452
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:40,843
- Hung out with friends
- And hit the skins

1453
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:43,579
Next week,
we're gonna do it again

1454
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:48,619
She's mine, fool!

1455
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,190
Nobody, ain't nobody

1456
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,062
Gonna hurt you

1457
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,566
Yo, Miles,
where you goin' with my girl?

1458
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:09,202
- Let go, or I will fuck you up!
- Yo, who you talkin'...

1459
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:13,107
Get off me, Miles!
Get off me!

1460
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:14,342
Stop! You're hurting me!

1461
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:17,984
Kid, help... Help me!

1462
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,318
It was very nice meeting you.
I'm sure we could...

1463
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,346
Those are the motherfuckers
who stole Kid's money!

1464
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:25,485
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell is going on here?

1465
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:26,687
Get out of my way!

1466
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:29,224
Hey, hold up!

1467
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:37,928
- Rick, she's right behind us.
- Hey, somebody stop her!

1468
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,741
- Get out of the way.
- Now you're gonna get it!

1469
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,405
Let her go,
or I'm gonna fly that head.

1470
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,073
She ain't nothin'. Take her.

1471
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,175
Hold her.

1472
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:51,451
Hey, get the fuck out my way.

1473
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,886
Yo, what you looking at, boy?
Campus security.

1474
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:00,952
Nobody make a goddamn move.
This is an illegal party.

1475
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,521
Yo, what kind of fuckin' lyric
was that?

1476
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,055
Turn your damn badge around.

1477
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,159
Oh, what up with that?
I'm sorry. It's upside-down.

1478
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:09,602
Everybody stop this shit!

1479
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,765
Get out of my way!

1480
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:14,469
This motherfucker's
trying to get away.

1481
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,704
Come on, man.

1482
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,905
Get the fuck out the way!

1483
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,938
Go on, grab her! She stole
Kid's scholarship check!

1484
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:22,575
Hold her!

1485
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:23,778
Let me go!

1486
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:26,986
I ain't tryin' to let you go.

1487
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,546
Zora, knock her out!

1488
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,031
Jungle fever, baby.

1489
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:38,191
- Jungle!
- Fever!

1490
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:40,394
- Jungle!
- Fever! Fever!

1491
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:45,298
Punk!

1492
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,898
Watch it, Pops!

1493
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:49,708
Damn, man.

1494
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,406
- Excuse me, man.
- And a colored, too.

1495
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:52,743
Oh, shit!

1496
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:53,907
I'm gonna kill you!

1497
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,109
Come here.

1498
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,544
Get out of my way!

1499
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,053
There he is right now!
Give it to him!

1500
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:08,989
"D."

1501
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:11,799
Get him, Mo!

1502
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,357
Oh, shit!

1503
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:18,271
Freeze that ass!

1504
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,912
Oh, shit!

1505
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,585
See ya, mophead.

1506
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:39,357
Away!

1507
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,123
Goddamn!

1508
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:43,188
That must be
the fifteenth time...

1509
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,391
We lost the pussy!

1510
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,998
Whose pussy is this?
Give me that good college pussy.

1511
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,809
Get up, punk! Get up!

1512
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:03,548
Wait! Get that mother!

1513
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,480
Get him!

1514
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,088
Yeah, right there.

1515
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,465
Freak show!

1516
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:20,991
What? Pull out a dick?

1517
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:24,096
What the fuck is going on?
Where's my gun?

1518
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,677
He's got a gun!

1519
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:36,513
- Hurry up!
- You crazy motherfuckers!

1520
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,143
I'm tryin' to fuck!

1521
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:42,848
You ain't shit.

1522
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:44,358
I'm through messin' around
with you.

1523
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,157
Oh, you gonna squab
like a man now, boy?

1524
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,029
This one's for the black!

1525
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,938
Is that all you got? Come on!

1526
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:14,715
See ya.

1527
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,089
And I sure wouldn't wanna be ya.

1528
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,631
Would you pull me up?

1529
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,768
- Stay still!
- Get me out of here.

1530
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:35,208
I'll never listen to another of
your harebrained schemes again!

1531
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:36,801
You in no position to talk shit.

1532
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:38,608
Just... just get me up.

1533
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,478
Just calm down, buddy.
I got ya.

1534
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:28,624
What is going on here?

1535
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:32,132
Hey, get...

1536
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,361
Get off me!
What up with that?

1537
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,768
Yo, man, yo,
we just doing our goddamn job.

1538
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,568
We got an 8-19,
breaking and entering.

1539
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,700
The description
matches you three clowns.

1540
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,336
Now, wait a minute.
I am a very patient man...

1541
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:46,541
but I want somebody to tell me,
what is going on here?

1542
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:49,675
I'll tell you what's going on.
She stole my boy's money.

1543
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,050
Oh, so that's where
your tuition money went.

1544
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:53,645
- Got it.
- That's right.

1545
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:56,020
And he stole his money, too...

1546
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,217
and hurt his girl.

1547
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:02,158
Listen,
it'll all make more sense...

1548
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:04,131
if, you know,
you knew the business.

1549
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,532
- It's close enough.
- And Sheila Landreaux...

1550
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:07,694
Sheila Landreaux?

1551
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:10,432
- A.k.a. Shareese Taylor?
- A.k.a. Sharnelle Butler?

1552
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,736
- That ho again?
- Well done, gentlemen.

1553
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,935
Let these men go.

1554
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,774
And I am very concerned that
your treatment of my officers...

1555
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,713
indicates
a deep-seated hostility...

1556
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,807
toward black men
in positions of authority.

1557
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,477
But, sir, I'm a black man.

1558
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:24,746
Then act like one.

1559
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,418
These men
have performed duties...

1560
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,548
above and beyond
the call of duty...

1561
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,684
and they will be
rewarded for it.

1562
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:34,752
Rewarded? Hey, fellas,
that means we get our stripes.

1563
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:37,993
Young man, you have a bright
future at this university.

1564
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,830
Miles,
your future is behind you.

1565
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,062
You're out of here. Take him!

1566
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:43,002
But, Dean Kramer,
it's a complete fabrication.

1567
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:46,098
It's a miscarriage of justice.
I ain't goin' out like that.

1568
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,574
Get 'em out of here.

1569
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:50,271
As for the rest of you,
fair warning...

1570
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:53,338
Time waits for no man.

1571
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,714
You have fifty-nine minutes
and thirty-two seconds...

1572
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,151
to put this building
back in its original shape...

1573
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,779
or you face expulsion.

1574
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:02,289
Have you got that?

1575
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:03,518
Peace.

1576
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,287
Will you look at this place?

1577
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,087
And I thought
they fucked my place up.

1578
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,291
- What am I gonna tell Mr. Lee?
- It's OK, man.

1579
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,563
I don't know,
but it better be real good.

1580
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,462
I'm out.

1581
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:16,663
That's your ass!

1582
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:19,799
Mr. Lee...

1583
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:21,308
Mr. Lee, my ass.

1584
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:24,073
I got three telephone calls,
including Dean Kramer...

1585
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,706
asking if I gave authorization
to use this hall.

1586
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:29,649
Now, now, uh, Mr. Lee, right?

1587
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,414
Check this out,
I know it looks bad...

1588
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:34,547
but it was for a good cause,
my brother.

1589
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:38,116
See, we had to borrow the place
to raise money for my man.

1590
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:42,118
Play, thanks, but no excuses.

1591
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,824
Give me the money.

1592
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,856
What, the ends for school?
Are you crazy?

1593
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,301
Play, no excuses.

1594
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:49,496
Give me the money.

1595
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,700
I have to do this by myself.

1596
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,872
Oh, and you expect me to stand
around and watch this, right?

1597
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,346
l... I can't do it.

1598
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,246
Illegal party,
half-naked women...

1599
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,553
What kind of way is that
to handle a money problem?

1600
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,115
How come you didn't come
to talk to me?

1601
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,725
I'm sorry I disappointed you,
Mr. Lee.

1602
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:19,333
Hey, I don't want your money.
I want to kick your ass.

1603
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,695
I know, but take this.

1604
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,967
And if it's not enough to cover
all the damages...

1605
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:26,871
I'll do whatever it takes
for as long as it takes...

1606
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:28,068
to make things right.

1607
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:51,459
Sorry, Pop.

1608
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,267
It's all right, Kid.

1609
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:02,510
No, man. Hello, Play, what's up?

1610
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:05,740
What are you doing here?

1611
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:10,083
I had a feeling
you'd be up here...

1612
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:12,018
so I figured I'd come up here
and give you a lift back.

1613
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:13,213
Thanks...

1614
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,056
but if you don't mind,
I'd rather be alone.

1615
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,026
Got a couple of cuties
waiting in the car, man.

1616
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:26,033
Remember the ones
in the pink negligee...

1617
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:24,721
You know,
I'm really gonna miss you.

1618
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:27,851
Come on, now.

1619
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,524
You know I'm gonna be up here
every weekend looking after you.

1620
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:50,041
Kid, I'm your boy.

1621
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,076
You know I'm gonna take care
of your girl while you're gone.

1622
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,985
Don't worry about it.

1623
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:57,617
You just keep those nasty-ass
dreads off my woman, all right?

1624
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,854
Yo, guys, I got to get
this stuff downstairs.

1625
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,420
Play's already an hour late.

1626
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:06,866
That means I got another
15 minutes before he gets here.

1627
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,926
That Kid
be on some serious C.P.T.

1628
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,437
Wait. Hold up.

1629
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:13,106
There's some people
I got to see before I go.

1630
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,014
How you doin', son?

1631
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:27,749
Not so good.

1632
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,484
Things didn't work out, so...

1633
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:31,082
I'm gonna be leavin' school.

1634
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:34,359
Just remember what I told you.

1635
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:36,420
Sometimes you got to do
what you don't want to do...

1636
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,022
in order to get
where you want to be.

1637
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,067
Remember,
if you ever need anything...

1638
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:43,263
I'm here for you.

1639
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,135
Thanks a lot, Mr. Lee.

1640
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:48,335
I'll be back.

1641
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,304
I'll save a plastic cap
for you...

1642
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:54,542
with your name on it.

1643
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,989
Professor Sinclair?

1644
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,186
Sir?

1645
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:08,661
I was wondering
if you had a minute.

1646
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:12,657
Missed you in class today.

1647
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:15,433
I missed being in it.

1648
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:20,964
I guess that's something
I have to get used to.

1649
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,542
I have to drop out of school.

1650
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:26,707
Money problems.

1651
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:30,183
You quitting, Mr. Robinson?

1652
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:33,710
Well, I guess I just haven't
proved I belong here...

1653
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:35,017
at least not now.

1654
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:37,647
I thought that the student
who wrote this paper...

1655
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,887
did prove that he belonged here.

1656
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:42,961
"A-"?

1657
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:44,692
I had to take off
for the coffee stain.

1658
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:47,593
Chris...

1659
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:50,604
you are a talented writer...

1660
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:53,163
and you have earned a place
in this school.

1661
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,369
I have?

1662
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:59,045
If I got you a job
as my student assistant...

1663
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,377
could you get by?

1664
01:27:03,985 --> 01:27:06,146
It just wouldn't cover
all my expenses.

1665
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:08,052
But, hey, it's no big deal.

1666
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:10,887
I'll get a job, save my money.

1667
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,085
I'll be back.

1668
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:20,130
A lot of brothers and sisters
say that...

1669
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:22,662
and never come back.

1670
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,408
Make sure that you do.

1671
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:12,613
Check out our new car.
We got our stripes!

1672
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,552
I'll be right back.

1673
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:20,394
- Y'all don't be long now.
- OK, baby.

1674
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:22,355
All right.

1675
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:28,760
- What's up?
- Where's ForPlay?

1676
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:31,832
Yo, man, it's my fault
you had to drop out of school...

1677
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:33,773
and we can't have that.

1678
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,833
Here. I'm sorry, man.

1679
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:39,406
You said the "S" word.

1680
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:43,208
What do you want,
a fucking bullhorn or something?

1681
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:49,720
I can't believe it.

1682
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,588
You sold ForPlay?

1683
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,593
Sometimes you got to pay
what you owe, man.

1684
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:01,897
l... I can't believe it, man.
I don't know what to say.

1685
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:04,666
Yo, man, just let your grades
do your talking, man.

1686
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:06,298
That's all I want.

1687
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,640
Play, we're going to be late
for our centerfold shoot.

1688
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,345
I'm the photographer.

1689
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,512
Hurry up!

1690
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:19,247
Wait a minute.
You're gonna need an assistant.

1691
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:21,653
Let me put my things away,
and I'll get right with you, OK?

1692
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,213
Whoa, wait a minute, man, no.

1693
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:25,384
What I need you to do
is go upstairs...

1694
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:26,620
study your ass off...

1695
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,458
'cause I'm coming back
periodically...

1696
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:29,963
and I'm gonna check
the professors...

1697
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:31,157
and make sure
you're doing good, man.

1698
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,258
Don't let me down.
You're an investment now.

1699
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:35,826
I'm out of here,
five thousand on this thing.

1700
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,531
Come on, girls, let's go.
Come on, Bilal.

1701
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:42,970
Bilal, did I mention to you
the guy who bought ForPlay...

1702
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:45,137
has a brother
who's in the record business?

1703
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:54,047
Thanks, Pops.

1704
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:58,986
Hey, what's up? You stayin'?

1705
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:00,152
Yo, I got the dough, man.

1706
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,388
- Word?
- Yeah!

1707
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:02,953
You in there, money!

1708
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:06,661
"Know from whence you came."

1709
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:09,268
"If you know whence you came..."

1710
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:13,930
"there is really no limit
to where you can go."

1711
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:16,374
James Baldwin.

1712
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:49,236
Not "F"!

1713
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,139
"F-"!

1714
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:57,775
Atten-hut!

1715
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,247
About face!

1716
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:04,818
Papa say...

1717
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:08,392
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

1718
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:09,794
Slide!

1719
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:13,867
We are proud because
you have taken the high road...

1720
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:15,664
and not the low road.

1721
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,736
Unlike some
of our other youngsters...

1722
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:19,740
who shall remain nameless.

1723
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:23,969
Now break it on down.

1724
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:31,674
Mr...

1725
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,181
Robinson.

1726
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:03,616
Oh, damn, Kid.

1727
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:06,085
I'm thinkin'
like a motherfucker, man.

1728
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:08,387
Oh, you gonna get
an "A" today, girl.

1729
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:36,345
Fever! Fever! Fever!

1730
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:52,727
I'll get you, motherfuckers!

1731
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:54,200
Brothers, atten-hut!

1732
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,233
What?

1733
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:02,208
Hey, man, do you hear any music?

1734
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,069
No. What up with that?

1735
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:06,909
Yo, and there ain't
nobody here dancin'.

1736
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:09,280
Aw, shit,
and I wanna shake my ass.
