Easy, you two, ok?

740
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,700
We're on a mission searching
for radioactive waste.

741
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:01,002
You seen any lately?

742
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:03,673
Nah, the only thing
you're gonna find wasted

743
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:05,942
is your time.

744
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,170
Who's paying your ticket, Rick?

745
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:11,835
Guy named dupont.

746
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:13,975
Pulled me out of
a perfectly comfortable stupor.

747
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,610
Imagine that.

748
00:45:15,614 --> 00:45:17,254
Hey, don't let
the guard past, ok?

749
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:19,919
Check the roads on patrol.

750
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,988
Let me know.
Ok.

751
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:23,987
Whew.

752
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:26,758
Dupont.
Class "b" scumbag.

753
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,757
Guy shovels arms from
north Korea via east Africa.

754
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,430
You can think him for half
the carnage in this country.

755
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,099
He's in it for the money.

756
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:35,756
See, he's partners
with the fascist murderers

757
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,895
who run this country,
so watch your back.

758
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,370
I'll remember to do that.

759
00:45:39,368 --> 00:45:40,898
Why's he looking for you?

760
00:45:40,902 --> 00:45:42,422
I don't know, man.

761
00:45:42,419 --> 00:45:43,939
You'll have to ask him,
I guess, you know.

762
00:45:43,938 --> 00:45:45,068
Truth is, after Elvis died

763
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:47,712
I decided it was time
for a life change.

764
00:45:47,707 --> 00:45:50,767
I'm not even the same
person I was a year ago.

765
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:53,136
Congratulations.
Where are the drums?

766
00:45:53,145 --> 00:45:53,975
History.

767
00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:55,209
I took care of them, man.

768
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:56,453
No one's ever gonna find
them puppies.

769
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:57,778
They're leaking.

770
00:45:57,782 --> 00:45:59,172
Do you have any idea

771
00:45:59,171 --> 00:46:00,561
how many people have died?

772
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,950
Leaking? No, I think
you're misinformed.

773
00:46:01,952 --> 00:46:05,022
I think the only death
you seen is murder.

774
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:07,421
Murder by contamination.

775
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,822
Look, who, there's only
one water source

776
00:46:09,825 --> 00:46:10,815
in this whole region.

777
00:46:10,826 --> 00:46:11,956
All the rest are tributaries.

778
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,930
So let me ask you a question...

779
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:19,198
how many of the villages
upstream had no survivors?

780
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:22,934
Rebel villages?

781
00:46:22,935 --> 00:46:25,465
That's right.
Unprotected.

782
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,900
Slaughtered.

783
00:46:26,904 --> 00:46:30,044
You's a scapegoat, man.

784
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,770
You and our toxic drums.

785
00:46:32,776 --> 00:46:35,806
Our toxic drums?
No, that's... that's...

786
00:46:35,812 --> 00:46:37,112
thank you for sharing.
That's very generous.

787
00:46:37,113 --> 00:46:38,213
The toxic drums, all right?

788
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:39,754
I didn't... that's not
my fault, man.

789
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:41,408
They were about to hang me,
God damn it.

790
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,216
We'll talk later
when we're alone, ok?

791
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,977
I got to check the perimeters.

792
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:47,085
You do that.

793
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:57,755
Scott: Remember
that freighter that sunk

794
00:46:57,763 --> 00:47:00,003
off the coast
about a year back?

795
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:00,958
Morgan: No.

796
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:02,925
Why, is that your supply ship?

797
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:06,073
No, man. I got a call
from an associate.

798
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:07,999
He told me that
freighter was gonna be

799
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:09,174
in the Indian ocean

800
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:10,341
on its way to north Korea

801
00:47:10,338 --> 00:47:12,908
to deliver
some rusted sub parts.

802
00:47:12,907 --> 00:47:14,937
Parts? We're not talking
periscopes here.

803
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:17,912
No, we're talking
enriched uranium rods,

804
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:20,411
worth many, many millions.

805
00:47:20,413 --> 00:47:22,313
Anyways, I figured why not

806
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:25,284
intercept the freighter,
take those rods,

807
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:26,883
stash them in toxic drums,

808
00:47:26,884 --> 00:47:28,184
and build myself
a little nest egg.

809
00:47:28,185 --> 00:47:30,885
Company doesn't exactly
give you a retirement fund,

810
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:32,847
so I just kind of took
it upon myself.

811
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:34,455
You're not in a cove
with a pirate,

812
00:47:34,456 --> 00:47:36,056
you're a c.I.A. Spook
for the Indian ocean,

813
00:47:36,058 --> 00:47:37,558
aren't you?

814
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,059
Been a family business
since the war, man.

815
00:47:39,061 --> 00:47:40,341
50 years of tradition.

816
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:41,619
Now, you should thank them.

817
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:42,887
They're the ones who got
your ass out of here alive

818
00:47:42,898 --> 00:47:44,898
instead of in a body bag
a year back.

819
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,900
Truth is, they're pretty
damn pissed off at me.

820
00:47:47,903 --> 00:47:49,003
They definitely would
have killed me

821
00:47:49,004 --> 00:47:50,774
if they didn't think
I was already dead,

822
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:52,512
so if you wouldn't mind.

823
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:54,867
Only you and nando know.

824
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:55,936
And dupont.

825
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:57,143
Dupont, man.
That dumbass prob...

826
00:47:57,144 --> 00:47:58,914
you know, I'll say one
thing in his defense,

827
00:47:58,912 --> 00:48:00,912
at least he wears his
bullshit on his sleeve.

828
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:02,784
We promised the American dream,

829
00:48:02,782 --> 00:48:05,222
and we delivered
total destruction.

830
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:08,147
[Speaking native language]

831
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:14,293
Go home, Rick.

832
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,291
You didn't commit
no crime, man.

833
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,564
Now, get the hell out of dodge

834
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:20,191
so we can open up
a can of whoop ass

835
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:23,125
and give you the first helping.

836
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:28,065
Get the kids in the bunker!

up to the high village.
