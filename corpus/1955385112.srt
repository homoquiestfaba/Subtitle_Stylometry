00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,835
Oh, is it?

177
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,703
Yeah, that's the point,
loser.

178
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,523
You guys think you're some kind
of monster experts?

179
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,041
Prove it.

180
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,046
- That's what I thought.

00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,902
Tomorrow-Halloween.

184
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:57,621

00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,841
Okay, Charlie,
it's your funeral.

187
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:05,445
Behind the school,
bike path, tomorrow,

188
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,314
6:00. Be there.

189
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,482
What did you
just get us into?

190
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,051
Please tell me
this is a dream.

191
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,654
- I think the word is "nightmare."
- Come on, guys!

192
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,024
Are we going to let them show us
up for the rest of our lives?

193
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:38,112
How many more swirlies and wedgies and wet
willies are we going to have to take?

194
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,764
I don't know, Charlie, but I'd rather
take more of what they're dishing out

195
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,283
than go near
that Sullivan house.

196
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,735
Yeah, Charlie,
the house is haunted.

197
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,720
Not sure what's confusing
about that.

198
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,905
And you guys
actually believe that?

199
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:50,890
Yeah, why wouldn't we?

200
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:52,792
You just want us
to come with you.

201
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:56,129
Guys, we're going to be in the
same school as them next year.

202
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:59,483
Do you really want to be a punching
bag for those jerks 'til we graduate?

203
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,302
Fine, I'm done.

204
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,425
So what do you have in mind?

205
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,012
Yeah, what's the plan?

206
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:15,248
Meet me at my house at 6:00.
I'll lay it out for you guys.

207
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,685
- So you mean you'll make it up as you go?
- Exactly.

208
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,467
Charlie, I wish
you'd drink more milk.

209
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,052
Stop with all that soda.

210
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,405
I'm allergic to milk, mom.
Remember?

211
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:42,058
And I haven't had a soda
in, like, forever.

212
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,676
Yeah, he's allergic
to everything,

- especially girls.
- Zip it, runt.

214

Oh no, you don't
still have the hots

215
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,850
for the girl
in your Chemistry Lab, do you?

216
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,986
I'm serious, Todd.

217
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:54,537
I've got a better idea.

218
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,341
Why don't you come over here
and make me zip it?

219

- Hey!

221
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,531
And they say you can't
train a baby.

222
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,251
Charlie, Todd, stop it.
Just eat.

223
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,970
I got you some almond milk. They say
it's better for your digestive tract.

224
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:14,274
Yeah, Charles, or how about
some of Noah's baby formula?

225
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,326
I'm warning you, Todd.

226
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:26,703
Warning me how?

227
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,822
Sit down and be quiet, Todd,

228
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:31,925
or I'm going to let Charlie have five
minutes alone with you off the leash.

229

Not cool, Russ!

- It already sucks.

Yeah, but we're talking about it
going to an entirely new level.

to get our parents

to let us stay the night
in that old house?

262

It's simple.
We tell our parents

that we're staying over
at each other's houses,

264

will gives hers to the dog before I can.

more physical, okay?

at your computers.

comes over on Halloween, anyway?

I promise.

on that test.

are doing.

- Really?

Maybe we should have a talk
with mom and dad then.

for a week.

for my silence.

for my sister, forget about it.

702
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,495
Turn your light on, Charlie.
I can't see a thing in here.

703
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:32,397
It's out there.
I dropped it.

704

Well, we're not getting out
this way.

- What does that matter?!

709
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,709
Sunrise is 6:48 a.m.
I looked it up!

710
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:46,744
I say we stay right here
until it's light.

711
00:42:46,746 --> 00:42:49,297
Then we make a break
for the front door.

712
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:51,733
Look, if whatever is out there
wanted to hurt us,

713
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,301
it would have done it already.

714
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,170
Maybe it's just trying
to scare us.

715
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,272
It's doing a pretty good job.

again.

explanation for all of this.

723

and it's got creaks and drafts

Go inside.

brother a kid could have.

to protect my investment too.

that lying was okay.

Charlie's friend Brandy
was right.

900
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,565
He should stay the night in the
house, see something through.

Maybe he could learn
that way.

902

to learn.

If he asked us to let him stay
the night in this old house-

1223
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:42,108
That's it.

1224
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,245
Good boy.

1225

What's he doing?

1226
01:14:47,048 --> 01:14:48,948
He's a dog.

1227
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:51,984
A dog needs a friend.

1228
01:14:54,422 --> 01:14:56,673

1232

Man's best friend, right?

1233
01:15:15,394 --> 01:15:18,011
Let's just get out stuff
and get out of here.

1234
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:33,693
Don't forget your Ranger knife,
goggles.

1235
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,845
Just in case.

1236
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:38,515
You think that thing
was really a ghost?

1237
01:15:38,517 --> 01:15:41,601
There's no such thing
as ghosts, remember?

1239

Besides, who'd believe us
anyway?

1240
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:54,997
This was the craziest adventure
we've ever had.

1241
01:15:54,999 --> 01:15:56,732
Yeah, and the coolest.

1242
01:15:56,734 --> 01:15:59,235
What are we going
to tell everybody at school?

1243
01:15:59,237 --> 01:16:01,487
Nothing.
It was a piece of cake.

1244
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:04,424

1245

ALEX:
No more bets, please.

1246
01:16:06,294 --> 01:16:07,910
This will be even better.

1247
01:16:07,912 --> 01:16:10,146
So we spread the word around

1248
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:12,315
that if we,
the lowly geek squad,

1249
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,417
can spend the night
in this place,

1250
01:16:14,419 --> 01:16:16,752
that Jake and his friends shouldn't
be afraid to do it either.

1251
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:20,122
Yeah, I heard Jake's
a dog person.

it'll let us out?

Uh... uh-oh, Charlie.
It's your dad.

1255
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,286
Todd must've squealed.

1256
01:16:50,288 --> 01:16:51,821
What are you
going to tell him?

1257
01:16:51,823 --> 01:16:53,940
The truth, I guess.

1258
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:57,177
Well, most of it anyway.

1259
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,412
Time to face the music.

1260
01:17:05,236 --> 01:17:06,836

Hey, dad.

1262
01:17:08,022 --> 01:17:09,923
BOTH:
Morning, Mr. Hamilton.

1263
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:12,258
So how was your study group
last night?

1264
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,261
I'm really sorry.
It's kind of a long story.

1265
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,130
I know.
I heard the whole thing.

1266
01:17:18,132 --> 01:17:19,332
Todd!

1267
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,084
It wasn't me this time,
I swear.

1268
01:17:21,086 --> 01:17:22,836
For once, he's actually
telling the truth.

1269
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:25,221
Your friend Brandy
came over last night.

1270
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:29,058
- She told me the whole story.
- She came to our house?

1271
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,578
Yeah. Personally, I think
she has a crush on me.

1272
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,097
But don't worry, Charlie.
I'll let her down easy.

1273
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:35,414
- Todd.
- What?

1274
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:37,217
Oh yeah, right, sorry.

1275
01:17:39,704 --> 01:17:42,388
She's a nice girl, Charlie.

1276
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:45,792
I'm sorry
that I lied to you, dad.

1277
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,994
Sorry about the whole thing.

1278
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,680
I know, and you're grounded
for lying, kiddo.

1279
01:17:50,682 --> 01:17:52,882
And I'm sure you guys are too
once your parents find out.

1280
01:17:52,884 --> 01:17:55,034
BOTH:
Yes, Mr. Hamilton.

1281
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,689
But I'm proud of you too.

1282
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:01,791
Thanks, dad.

1283
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:05,428
You boys must have had quite an
experience in there last night, huh?

1284
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:10,183
Nothing we couldn't handle.

1285
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:16,372
All right, let's go, boys.
Let's get you home. Come on.

1286

Hey, uh, do you mind
if we walk?

1287
01:18:20,194 --> 01:18:22,128
I'll come straight home,
I promise.

1288
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,263
All right, but straight home.

1289
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,964
All right? Let's go.

1290
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:27,416

1291
01:18:27,418 --> 01:18:30,136
Wow, I must be hearing things.

1292
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,222
We can discuss the matter
of my $25 later.

1293

Todd! Van now.

1294
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:48,737
Oh yeah,
and if your mom asks,

1295
01:18:48,739 --> 01:18:51,190
you tell her I got real angry
and I couldn't stop yelling,

1296
01:18:51,192 --> 01:18:53,292

all right?

in such a forgiving mood, Russ,

1300
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:01,917
there's this letter that got
sent home with me from school

1301
01:19:01,919 --> 01:19:03,919
that I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

1302
01:19:03,921 --> 01:19:05,321
- Todd?
- Yeah?

1303
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,889

the night for it.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay. He was actually
kind of cool about it.

No, I mean, about us?

- I mean, you were-
- Well, I was.

- this is so stupid.
