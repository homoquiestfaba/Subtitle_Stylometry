1
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,359
Where are you going?

2
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,352
<i>The Jeffersons'</i>s about to come on.

3
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,950
Damn! Taking this role-playing thing
a little serious, don't you think?

4
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,032
Shut up. You talk too much.

5
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,276
For real, where the hell is my TV?

6
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,999
Your ass is ringing. You want me to get it?

7
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,674
Just keep it hot. Wait. Talk to me!

8
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,114
Pier 16, half an hour.

9
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,760
- What?
<i>- You wanted to come to the Player's Ball.</i>

10
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,712
Here's your invitation.

11
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,555
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,712
That was the President.

13
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,916
Puffy remixed the national anthem.

14
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
They need me.

15
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,279
Mr. Miyako is expecting you. Follow me.

16
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,791
Thank you. Do I sense an accent?

17
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,556
- Yes, I'm from the Bahamas.
- Really? I know Rick Fox.

18
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,710
Do you know him? Turn around, girl.

19
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,113
Vanessa Williams!

20
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,034
I'll be back.

21
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,080
Hey, what's up, Miyako? My man.

22
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,756
Relax.

23
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,716
What's going on with your boy here?
My man needs a girlfriend.

24
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,314
He's just doing his job.

25
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,674
Boy, you....

26
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,112
You never cease to amaze me. Look at all
these fine women sitting around you, boy.

27
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,433
What's cracking, man?

28
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,832
This is what you've been waiting for.

29
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,355
Hang out.
Maybe you'll learn something tonight.

30
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,477
One of my dogs is fighting next.

31
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,190
I didn't come here to watch dogs fight.
I came here to get paid.

32
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,830
This is a party. Relax. Enjoy yourself.

33
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,080
I just got a page from Smokey Robinson.
I need to call him.

34
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,629
He's deaf in one ear
and there's a lot of noise here.

35
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,871
I'll go call him outside. I'll be right back.

36
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,998
If your guy keeps looking at me
the way he's looking at me...

37
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,992
tell him I'll throw him a fucking beating...

38
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,549
where his mother won't know him
when she see him.

39
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,395
His fucking face will look
like a fucking pizza pie or something.

40
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,679
I'll be right back.

41
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,033
Get him some ass.

42
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,075
Captain...

43
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,513
get down to Pier 16.

44
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,994
They're shipping the cocaine in liquid form.

45
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,073
And get this: They're shipping it in dogs.

46
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
- I don't get down like that, brother.
- Who you calling?

47
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,278
I'm calling my girlfriend,
that's who I'm calling. Damn cell phones.

48
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,875
Just bad reception, man.
All I keep hearing is....

49
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,751
<i>Gunshots reported at Pier 16.
All harbour units respond. Code 3.</i>

50
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,840
How're you gonna
just leave the party like that, man?

51
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,718
I missed <i>The Jeffersons</i> to be here.

52
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,671
Fuck you, cop.

53
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,870
I knew you were gonna wanna fight.

54
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,355
All right.

55
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,232
Did I thank you
for inviting me to the Player's Ball?

56
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,035
All right.

57
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,589
By the way, I am not a cop!

58
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,959
- Your money's in the regular place.
- Beautiful.

59
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,076
- Who's gonna get credit for this one?
- I think we'll give this one to Boston.

60
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,720
He's worked hard,
hasn't had a bust in a while.

61
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,192
- Boston needs to lighten up.
- That'll be Lieutenant Boston after this one.

62
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,199
Ain't that something?

63
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,031
- Anything I can do for you?
- Think I can keep the car another day?

64
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,713
You're pushing it.

65
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,152
How about your niece? All right.
I'm just kidding.

66
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,400
- I'm thinking about it, though.
- Everybody else hit it.

67
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,949
This was the shit, man!
We gotta do this again sometime.

68
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,399
When are you getting out? 30, 40, 50 years?

69
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,070
What, you got something in your eye?

70
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,039
- This ain't over.
- I'm scared.

71
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,558
Yo, Rad! Get in the car.

72
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,511
Move, motherfucker! Move!

73
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,396
You've got the wrong guy, brother.

74
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,115
I've been looking for you, motherfucker.

75
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,352
I ain't gonna be
but too many more "motherfuckers."

76
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,636
Shit!

77
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,157
- What's up, bitch?
- What's up, baby?

78
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,436
- Hold this.
- What's good, daddy?

79
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,954
- That's my man, Tico.
- Tico almost got fucked up.

80
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,317
Good to see you. It's been too long.
What's popping? You missed me?

81
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,595
It's hard to miss a brother...

82
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,912
when you see a poster of him
on Sunset Boulevard every day.

83
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,310
- What's up? When the album dropping?
- Next week.

84
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,756
In fact, we're on our way
to a listening party now.

85
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,832
- Wanna roll out?
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

86
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,879
Let's do it. Yo, driver, we off, baby. Let's go.

87
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,437
<i>Y'all make some motherfucking noise...</i>

88
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,035
<i>for New Freedom Records'
multi-platinum artist...</i>

89
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,796
<i>Benjamin, a.k.a. Killer Ben!</i>

90
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,915
<i>This is for my niggas doing biz
hold ya head</i>

91
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,469
<i>Mix tuna fish with the squid, hold the bread</i>

92
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,519
<i>For those getting hit at the board
got to get a reward</i>

93
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,751
<i>Park at the gate with incredible doors</i>

94
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,480
<i>This is D block, daddy
We touch dudes with Kalis</i>

95
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,155
<i>Give bricks to D, does juice from Cali</i>

96
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,357
<i>Do it for the adolescents wildin'</i>

97
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,433
<i>In the O.G.'s on the tail
with silk shirts at Bally's</i>

98
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,230
So what did you think?

99
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,551
You were putting it down.
That's what I like to see.

100
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,359
Ain't nothing. You ain't heard the half.

101
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,796
I got some more real fire for you to hear.
Heard me?

102
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,394
You know I gotta hear it.

103
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,039
Yeah, definitely.

104
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,791
Check it out, Dre. I really gotta roll.

105
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,951
- I'll catch up with you later.
- All right.

106
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,997
- One love, baby.
- All right.

107
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,158
- What's cracking, Andre?
- What's up, B.?

108
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,756
You know, I find it very disrespectful...

109
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,436
that you're talking to my artist
while he's under contract with me.

110
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,752
I'm gonna tell you this one time,
and one time only.

111
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,911
- Don't be fucking with my ones.
- I was being friendly with him, that's all.

112
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,630
You want to be friendly?
Buy yourself a motherfucking poodle.

113
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,878
This P.I. thing
must have really worked out for you?

114
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,316
What's your ball game now?
You still coaching down--

115
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,120
You know I'm still coaching.
We're going to the championship.

116
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,669
Hard to believe, with a ball hog for a coach.

117
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,152
Since you my dog and all that,
look how I'm doing here, baby.

118
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,678
What? You got married?

119
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,672
Last week in Vegas. Just me and her.

120
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,274
- Who is she?
- Her name is Venus.

121
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,273
She out of town right now,
but she's fine. An angel.

122
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,317
- You serious?
- I hope my mum likes her.

123
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,189
- They're gonna meet up tomorrow night.
- You know mas is a tough critic.

124
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,749
- That sounds real good.
- I gotta get out of here.

125
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,470
- Meet me at Stevie's, Ventura, Friday. 7:30?
- Do that. Well done.

126
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,233
Bring the car around back, dog.

127
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,631
You're getting your coat put on you
like you're James Brown now.

128
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,952
- I'm gonna see you on Friday, all right?
- Good seeing you.

129
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,272
- Stay up.
- You too, man. Don't stand me up, man.

130
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,794
No, never that.

131
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,669
Will that be all, sir?

132
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,151
Actually, Rhonda,
I was hoping I could get a--

133
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,913
It's on your napkin.

134
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,399
Benjamin. Coincidence
running into you over here.

135
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,436
What's up?

136
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,433
I'll kick it straight with you,
'cause I'm a businessman and all.

137
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,240
Funk U Up Records know about
your contract with New Freedom.

138
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,155
Basically, we ready to do whatever it take
to make you a part of the team, player.

139
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,196
I'm straight, you know.

140
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,795
What do you mean?
Think you're too good for us?

141
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,679
The last album you all put out
was called <i>Garbage Truck Juice.</i>

142
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,231
If I didn't know better, I'd think
your bad-boy ass is trying to insult me.

143
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,438
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I ain't even going to trip off that, man.

144
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,070
Just sign this letter of intent,
and we're good, baby.

145
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,914
- I'm straight, dog.
- Kid, I'm not asking you.

146
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,993
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the one who'll make you reconsider.

147
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,959
Hey, fellows. What's up, man?

148
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,394
- We got a problem here?
- You bet your ass we got a problem.

149
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,075
I ain't got no problem
kicking somebody's ass your size.

150
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,197
That's factory equipment for me, baby.

151
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,670
But him, you may have a problem.

152
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,075
- Go on. Get the fuck out of here.
- Get your big hamburger-ass out of here.

153
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,113
Get the fuck out of here.

154
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,351
Fake-ass suit. Get in the damn car!

155
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,478
Just remember what I said, Benji!
I'm gonna see you, man.

156
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,870
- This is your life, right here!
- Whatever.

157
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,555
- Where's your bodyguard, man?
- I don't know.

158
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,760
- My bad, man.
- Yeah, all right. Whatever.

159
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,311
- What's that all about?
- It ain't nothing, you know. Just business.

160
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,876
- What's up, Rad?
- What's going on?

161
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,920
How cute!

162
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,398
Yeah. I finally found a man
that won't leave you.

163
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,520
- Check yourself.
- What's up? What you got for me today?

164
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,840
Now, mind you,
this is a bit generic for my taste...

165
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,072
- but it's definitely your steelo.
- Boy, I can't wait.

166
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,195
<i>I love you.</i>

167
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,036
- Did you just turn that on?
- Yeah, why?

168
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,589
- Give me the doll, Rad.
- No, I like it. What?

169
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,593
- Give me the goddamn doll, Rad!
- Lisa, what is your problem?

170
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,912
Give me the goddamn doll,
or I'm gonna jack your ass off.

171
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,480
<i>Too late.</i>

172
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,554
- What the fuck was that?
- I call it the Tracy Doll.

173
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,519
- Like in your ex-boyfriend Tracy?
- Made sense at the time.

174
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,954
You got issues.

175
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,192
- I live in L.A. Don't blame me.
- Oh, my goodness.

176
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,079
- You know what the problem is?
- What?

177
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,356
You sell all your good stuff
to Sharper Image.

178
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,274
- Then you give your boy the bullshit.
- Sharper Image pays me.

179
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,159
- You're gonna take it there?
- Yeah. And, Rad...

180
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,991
how about letting me go out with you?
I'm tired of being huddled up in here.

181
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,515
You know I can do it. I'm practicing Tae Bo.

182
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,478
- That was a good move. Do that again.
- What?

183
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,552
Let me see that move again.

184
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,352
Yeah, okay. Lisa.

185
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,435
- Let me think about it.
- Think about it.

186
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,996
No.

187
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,352
Tell me, what's up with this Wild Wild West?

188
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,557
Don't touch, all right? See this one here?

189
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,919
This one can knock out a 300-pound man
100 yards away.

190
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,393
I call it Magilla.

191
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,314
And this one, here.

192
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,030
I'm not exactly sure what this one does,
because I haven't used it yet.

193
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,440
What is it supposed to do?

194
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,319
Inject adrenalin into the sexual glands...

195
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,199
thereby causing deep passion.

196
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,594
I call it Thriller.

197
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,356
Okay. Why the hell
would you need something like that?

198
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,954
You're kidding, right?

199
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,793
- You keep the love potion.
- Okay.

200
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,633
I'm gonna see you later.

201
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,554
- Call me if you need me, Rad.
- No!

202
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,875
Inject some adrenalin into your ass.

203
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,038
Compliments of Miyako.

204
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,117
I'm Chinese, motherfucker!

205
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,475
You know, I'm hurting right here, too.

206
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,355
Need a little bit of touching. Yeah.

207
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,310
Right there, too. Another peck.

208
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,640
Right there.

209
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,952
Here. Right there, too.

210
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,271
Okay, now, I really need you
to concentrate...

211
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,273
because this region, right here...

212
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,837
it's just in bad shape, okay?

213
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,959
Damn it! Just keep it hot.

214
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,880
Talk to me.

215
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,153
What's up, Captain?

216
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,755
Right now?

217
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,715
All right. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

218
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,154
Make that 11.

219
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,549
This better be good because
I was just giving this waitress a massive tip.

220
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,150
You don't need to be here, Conrad.

221
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,314
Just let it be.

222
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,671
- Get the fuck out of here, man!
- Everybody, let's go.

223
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,195
Can everybody get the fuck out of here?

224
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,913
Make sure your report reflects that we have
evidence to support a murder-suicide here.

225
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,754
Most of these rap guys
are unstable, anyhow.

226
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,076
Captain, this wasn't a suicide.

227
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,318
- What do you need?
- Time.

228
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,592
You got 36 hours.
After that, it goes into the system.

229
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,639
Whatever evidence we have
is how we'll designate the case.

230
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,554
I know that's shitty,
but we're backlogged like crazy...

231
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,791
and Benji did have a rap sheet.

232
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,433
I'm real sorry, kiddo.
That's the best I can do.

233
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,874
<i>Amazing grace</i>

234
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,675
<i>How sweet</i>

235
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,634
<i>the sound</i>

236
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,237
<i>that saved</i>

237
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,194
<i>a wretch</i>

238
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,311
<i>like me</i>

239
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,834
<i>I once</i>

240
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,598
<i>was lost</i>

241
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,114
<i>but now</i>

242
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,789
<i>am found</i>

243
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,440
We are live and exclusive
at the funeral for rap superstar Benjamin.

244
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,230
As you know, there has been a tremendous
amount of secrecy surrounding his death.

245
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,789
Thousands of people
are still in a state of mourning...

246
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,599
over the recently deceased singer.

247
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,310
But here at the Balboa Street Cemetery,
only close friends and family...

248
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,393
have been allowed
to say their final goodbyes to the artist.

249
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,031
- You gonna be okay?
- I'll be okay.

250
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,320
I still can come by on Sundays
to get my pie?

251
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,880
You know it.

252
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,396
Go on.

253
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,033
All right, it's okay.

254
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,195
Mr. Freeman!

255
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,119
- My name is--
- I know who you are.

256
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,238
- You're Benjamin's boy Conrad, right?
- That's right.

257
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,279
- I'm investigating Benji's--
- You haven't been watching the news?

258
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,716
- The media said it was suicide.
- That's what they say.

259
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,157
I'd like to talk to you as soon as possible,
if you don't mind.

260
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,993
This is a funeral for your friend,
and you come at me, playing detective?

261
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,033
Why don't you respect a brother?

262
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,760
I mean, you're coming at me
like I'm some kind of suspect.

263
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,435
- If you got nothing to hide--
- Fuck you!

264
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,232
Benjamin was a friend of mine.

265
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,833
Shit! I made the motherfucker rich.
What the fuck did you do for him?

266
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,999
That's what I thought.

267
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,751
How about 12:00 p.m. tomorrow...

268
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,237
if you can wake your big ass up?

269
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,871
Our time is gonna come soon.

270
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,553
Trust me on that.

271
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,833
You must be Venus.

272
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,994
Conrad McCrae.

273
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,635
Benji talked about you all the time.

274
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,112
He didn't kill himself.

275
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,119
What was he like?

276
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,431
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

277
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,430
would he have wanted any children?

278
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,672
I never got a chance
to talk about any of that stuff.

279
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,956
I may not have known everything about him
I could've known...

280
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,396
but I know he didn't kill himself.

281
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,315
I know it.

282
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,072
Do you know about B. Free?

283
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,600
Yeah, I just met him.

284
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,957
Do you know
that he has three of the same cars...

285
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,078
so that his enemies
won't know which one he's in?

286
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,274
What record company CEO does that?

287
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,072
One that's in a whole lot more
than just selling records.

288
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,436
I need you to help me find out...

289
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,957
what really happened to Benji.

290
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,510
- You know you're rich, right?
- What?

291
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,040
My mum used to tell me that all the time.

292
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,075
We would sit in the backyard
on a clear summer night.

293
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,631
She would look up into the sky,
smile, and say, "We're rich."

294
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,877
You see, she grew up in the inner city...

295
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,840
and ain't never got a chance to see the stars
'cause of the streetlights.

296
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,913
Then one night,
she was visiting the suburbs...

297
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,600
and she saw them.

298
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,039
Right then and there, she realised
why people in the suburbs are rich.

299
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,238
That's why she worked so hard
to move us out there.

300
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,115
Just so her family could see the stars.

301
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,916
- You miss her.
- Every day.

302
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,755
When she got ill, there was nothing
I could do but watch her die.

303
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,718
But now with Benji, you can do something.

304
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,956
You can make things right, Rad.

305
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,079
You know, Lisa...

306
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,316
I really do value our friendship.

307
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,714
I love you, too.

308
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,118
- Damn, fool!
- You don't kick nobody.

309
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,477
- Let go of me.
- No, I've got you.

310
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,552
What you gonna do? Come on!

311
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,997
- I'll take you--
- Chill! What are you guys doing?

312
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,554
You're on the same team.

313
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,394
- He won't pass the ball. I was wide open.
- No, you weren't!

314
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,834
- Ball hog!
- Shut up!

315
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,680
That's enough.

316
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,070
Do you two want to play
in the championship game?

317
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,509
The only way you gonna do that is if
you beat Duran and J.R. in the two-on-two.

318
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,353
- No problem.
- Yeah, we'll smoke 'em.

319
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,875
Then we'll make it interesting, okay?

320
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,912
The game is seven. Duran and J.R. has six.
You guys have nothing.

321
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,275
- What?
- That's not fair!

322
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,910
"That's not fair." Okay, then I suggest
you pass the ball, all right?

323
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,037
Everybody else, on the baseline.

324
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,192
Kyle and Randall lose this game,
everybody else is running laps.

325
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,237
So you better root for your team-mate.

326
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
Pass it back.

327
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,675
Come on!

328
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,956
Talk to me.

329
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,111
<i>Yo, motherfucker,
you better watch your back.</i>

330
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,672
<i>Stay out of grown folk's business,
or your ass will end up just like Benji's.</i>

331
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,718
Come on, Randall, pass it!

332
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,995
Dag, man!

333
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,312
- Play some defence.
- What?

334
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,511
- Who the fuck is this?
- Venus.

335
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,437
<i>Conrad, I need you to come over right now.</i>

336
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,036
- I just got a crank call. I'm really scared.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

337
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,520
I'm at the Regency Building.

338
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,592
<i>- Room 302.</i>
- All right, I'm on my way.

339
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,719
- Who is it?
- It's Rad.

340
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,637
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

341
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,317
Just a little freaked out.

342
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,392
Somebody don't want me to find out
who really killed Benji.

343
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,237
We need to get you out of here.
Get your things.

344
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,595
All right.

345
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,196
Shit!

346
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,914
Shit! Come on!

347
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,999
- You okay?
- I'm fine. What are we gonna do?

348
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,637
- You afraid of heights?
- What?

349
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,232
Do you feel the spirit?

350
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,032
Do you feel? Do you feel the vibrations?

351
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,155
All right. We are praying to the gods.

352
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,790
I call on God, Jesus, Baal,
and everybody else to bring Bobby here!

353
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,950
Feel his presence! It was an untimely death.

354
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,073
Do not mess up the move.

355
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,759
Send us our son!

356
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,073
It's all good. Keep....

357
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,951
Mama, please! This is not the time
to be talking about this right now.

358
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,032
I got to go. I got to work.

359
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,516
Demise?

360
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,914
What the fuck!

361
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,590
Come on, let's go.

362
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,750
- Give me your keys.
- I don't have them. I left them upstairs.

363
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,713
- What the hell is that?
- Lisa. You'll meet her.

364
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,836
- Are you okay?
- I'm getting there.

365
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,397
You must tell me everything you know
about Benji's business dealings.

366
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,834
- I don't--
- Think.

367
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,240
- I don't know anything!
- Think!

368
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,755
- I don't know anything!
- Lady, I want you to think!

369
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,799
- I don't fucking know anything--
- Come on, now!

370
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,032
- Think.
- Call his lawyer.

371
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,318
- His lawyer would know something.
- What's his name?

372
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,519
David Rabinovitz.

373
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,831
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

374
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,193
I saw the tape.
Look, they're saying she's 14.

375
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,000
I saw you jack off. I can't fucking help you!

376
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,714
I saw you piss on her,
and then you jacked off!

377
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,359
David Rabinovitz?

378
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,999
Ted, let me get right back with you.
I have some blacks in front of me. Great.

379
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,352
I'm Conrad McCrae, Private Investigator.
This is Venus Hatchett.

380
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,159
- You have a minute?
- Venus, yeah.

381
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,233
I was just discussing your husband's death.

382
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,195
Talented guy. He could rap.

383
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,433
- Could you clear a few things up for me?
- Anything you guys need.

384
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,991
- First, do you have a copy of Benji's will?
- Benji's will.

385
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,000
I know that there's a Bentley, the Rolex....

386
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,878
Where's the Platinum....

387
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,395
It was right under the Platinum account.

388
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,710
- Here it is, right here.
- Thank you.

389
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,831
Can you guys hold for a second?
Pam, can you get...

390
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,557
- Reggie Fiess' number?
- All right.

391
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,320
Anything unusual happen with Benji
the past few weeks?

392
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,110
Not really. The usual contracts,
new album coming out...

393
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,510
- getting ready for that video shoot.
- A video shoot?

394
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,833
Yeah, Paul Williams
is shooting <i>Bitch, Shake That Ass.</i>

395
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,717
It's gonna be phat. All the things
the blacks do with the videos...

396
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,996
with the girls and whatever.

397
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,316
Hold on.
Pam, can you please get Line 7? Shit!

398
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,470
- Who's Armageddon?
- Silent partner.

399
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,553
It says here that...

400
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,634
this guy Armageddon is to receive
the bulk of Benji's royalties...

401
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,713
and all his publishing rights.
What would that be worth?

402
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,110
- Millions.
- And no one knows who this cat is?

403
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,516
That seems a little suspicious,
don't you think?

404
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,640
Of course, Venus, you receive
50 percent of the estate once he passed.

405
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,355
Goddamn.

406
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,352
Talk to me. Hi, Sister Karen.

407
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,357
No, you can tell the boys
I will be at the championship.

408
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,954
All right, bye now.

409
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,633
Where are we going?

410
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,917
It's time to take you to a safe place.

411
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,953
<i>Coming up is the first single
off of Benjamin's never-heard-before album.</i>

412
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,115
<i>Rest in peace, Benji.</i>

413
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,760
<i>This is for my niggas doing biz
hold ya head</i>

414
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,355
<i>Mix tuna fish with the squid, hold the bread</i>

415
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,319
<i>For those getting hit at the board
got to get a reward</i>

416
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,392
<i>Park at the gate with incredible doors</i>

417
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,518
<i>This is D block, daddy
We touch dudes with Kalis</i>

418
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,000
Can I just stay with you? I'd feel much safer.

419
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,231
Trust me. She'll keep you safe.

420
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,710
She's got more firepower than Waco.

421
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,919
- What's up, Rad?
- What's up, Lisa?

422
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,276
Lisa, this is Venus. Venus, Lisa.

423
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,040
- How you doing?
- Okay.

424
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,589
So, you come up with a name for him yet?

425
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,559
- Kaboom! Yeah, that's it.
- He's adorable!

426
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,074
I should have known.

427
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,358
Lisa, I was just telling Venus
how much I trust you...

428
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,877
and that you got my back,
and I was just wondering...

429
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,398
if she could stay here
until I could figure out a few things.

430
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,040
Sure. Why don't you go
make yourself at home?

431
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,793
- Thanks.
- I told you.

432
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,110
Thanks.

433
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,554
Kaboom is heavy.

434
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,030
So, Rad, wassup?

435
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,393
You're turning me into a baby-sitter.
The girl, the dog.

436
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,797
When will you let me
get out there with you?

437
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,999
Come on, Lisa, you know your place is here,
designing all this crazy stuff.

438
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,836
- This shit ain't that crazy, though.
- Come on, now, it's a little crazy.

439
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,832
Plutonium-laced tampons?

440
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,800
Statistically speaking, there are
more and more female terrorists every day.

441
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,270
You'll see. Them tampons are gonna pay off.

442
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,034
Just give me a call
if something strange happens, okay?

443
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,156
No doubt.

444
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,631
And try not to kill Venus by accident.

445
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,035
- I will.
- You promise?

446
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,190
- I'll try.
- All right.

447
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,475
- Got you.
- Thank you.

448
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,517
We need her on the set now.

449
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,874
<i>Now I can send you on your way
or just split your knot</i>

450
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,475
<i>And you can talk to Pun,
and kick shit to Pac</i>

451
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,075
<i>Tell Big you dig city spit the hot</i>

452
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,629
<i>I got you feelin' for this R&B kid to drop</i>

453
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,632
<i>Keep it locked, push mad hits</i>

454
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,951
<i>I'm R&B but got a thing for this rap shit</i>

455
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,635
<i>You think I ain't touching
don't stop the madness</i>

456
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,280
<i>I got a deal, I got dough, I got a bad bitch</i>

457
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,238
Cut! That was nice!

458
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,279
I like all that, when you grab the ass.
That was nice.

459
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,919
Remember to do that every take.

460
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,072
- We can wrap that.
- Yeah, like that's hard for you.

461
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,835
I'm Conrad McCrae, Private Investigator.
I'm looking into Benjamin Hatchett's murder.

462
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,389
- Yeah, Benji.
- I talked to David Rabinovitz.

463
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,518
He said you spent a lot of time with Benji
for the new video.

464
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,117
- Right, we were trying to close that deal--
- Have you ever heard of Armageddon?

465
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,919
No, I do not know him personally.

466
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,392
But my partner, who produced Benji's
album, said he was a writer or something.

467
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,634
What can you tell me about Demise?

468
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,312
Yeah, I'll tell you that...

469
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,632
that <i>Garbage Juice Truck,</i>
or whatever it is, <i>Garbage Truck Juice...</i>

470
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,872
was one of the shittiest songs
I've ever heard.

471
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,475
What about that record label, Funk U Up?

472
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,075
Mr. Williams? You have a call on Line 3.

473
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,998
Yeah, give me a second.

474
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,470
Listen, I don't know
how much you know about this...

475
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,474
but anybody who knows anything
knows not to ask those kinds of questions.

476
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,439
- You wanna build on that?
- They don't sell any records.

477
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,798
They got Beverly Hills offices,
gold-plated desk...

478
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,760
and they pay for $100,000 videos in cash.

479
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,669
You didn't hear that from me.

480
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,275
Now, that was the one, right there.

481
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,829
Playback. Check this out.

482
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,309
This is Conrad. He's a private investigator...

483
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,359
checking out Benji Hatchett's case.
Listen, I'll be right back.

484
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,797
I heard you guys were kicking it a lot
before the incident.

485
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,596
Was he stressed out?
Can you tell me anything?

486
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,639
I haven't really seen too much of him,
'cause he was like....

487
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,360
- He was caught between his girl and school.
- School?

488
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,638
Some community college up north.
But he was keeping it on the low.

489
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,712
Did he ever mention Armageddon to you?

490
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,759
- Like the ending of the world?
- He's talking about Armageddon.

491
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,436
The writer, Armageddon.
He's high. He's been smoking that shit.

492
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,677
I never heard of him, man.
Want some of this?

493
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,194
- No, dog, I'm on a diet.
- Sure?

494
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,316
- Yeah.
- All right.

495
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,199
Look, I know you brothers are busy.
I appreciate your time.

496
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,956
But anything comes up, could you....

497
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,439
- Sure.
- Okay, peace.

498
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,954
- See you.
- All right.

499
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,111
Okay, my people, let's recap.

500
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,393
Jean Baptiste Pointe duSable.

501
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,154
Black pioneer, trader,
and founder of the settlement...

502
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,312
that later became known as
the city of Chicago.

503
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,479
He and his Native American wife...

504
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,633
took up residencies on Lake Michigan...

505
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,111
at the mouth of what became known as
the Chicago River.

506
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,953
It is his residency here...

507
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,398
that established his name as
the Father of Chicago.

508
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,958
Some of you may think
Michael Jordan was the Father of Chicago...

509
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,635
but actually it was Mr. duSable.

510
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,239
There are four chapters of Mr. duSable
in your books.

511
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,916
I want you to read them,
learn them, know them.

512
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,235
For tomorrow you will be richer for it.

513
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,439
Have a blessed day.

514
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,120
He was spiritual and enlightened
in contrast to most of his peers.

515
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,712
He also had a great interest
in history and philosophy.

516
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,918
I suppose that's what made him
such a great writer.

517
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,559
He had a writing partner.

518
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,711
Is that a question or a comment?

519
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,679
His name was Armageddon.
Did he ever mention him to you?

520
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,198
- No, I think I'd remember a name like that.
- I see.

521
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,631
You know,
it's a shame that such a good guy...

522
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,712
could be killed over money.

523
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,077
We don't know he was killed over money.

524
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,880
Well, it is the great motivator, isn't it?

525
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,519
I guess you're right.

526
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,557
I'll be in touch, Professor.

527
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,792
Mr. McCrae.

528
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,592
- Send my condolences to his family.
- No doubt.

529
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,274
What's up, B.? You know...

530
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,391
we had a hundred ways of saying goodbye:

531
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,552
"Later," "holler back"...

532
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,719
"Audi 5,000"...

533
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,553
"peace, peace out."

534
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,832
But we were never prepared...

535
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,758
to say goodbye forever.

536
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,073
How do you say that?

537
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,835
...evidence to support
a murder-suicide here.

538
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,070
Time!

539
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,840
What's going on?
You're acting like you're not team-mates.

540
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,593
Coach, he won't pass the ball.

541
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,354
We don't have time for that.
This is for the championship.

542
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,672
I want you to bring the ball home.
We got 10 seconds.

543
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,673
I want a good shot. Can we win it?
Let's go. Ready?

544
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,037
One, two, three, play!

545
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,035
Pick up the phone!

546
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,112
Lieutenant. The gun was in his right hand.

547
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,073
<i>- So what?</i>
- He couldn't dial with his right hand.

548
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,629
He couldn't shoot a basketball
or pull a trigger.

549
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,155
<i>That's a good start, but I need more.</i>

550
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,079
I'll be in touch.

551
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,439
Excuse me, Lieutenant. We have
a civilian here to see you: Conrad McCrae.

552
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,556
Thank you.

553
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,276
I think I want to drop and give her 50.

554
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,680
I see the government
is recruiting fine these days.

555
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,991
And I see some things never change.

556
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,037
What's up, Lieutenant?
It's been a long time.

557
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,113
- Too long. Should I take that personally?
- I would.

558
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,432
Okay. To what do I owe
the honour of your visit?

559
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,714
Come on. Why are you playing me like that?
You know I miss you guys.

560
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,271
The camaraderie we used to have,
the system, the fly uniforms.

561
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,272
Okay, what do you really want?

562
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,354
I need some information
about Benji Hatchett.

563
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,236
Federal?

564
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,637
You know I could get fired for this.

565
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,157
You know if anybody can do it, you can.
I'll make it up to you.

566
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,630
I'll do it because I'm a fan.

567
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,632
I didn't know you like rap.

568
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,791
I meant a fan of yours, Conrad.

569
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,476
Does the government know you're a freak?

570
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,153
What exactly are we looking for?

571
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,312
Anything. I've been on a wild-goose chase
since this thing started.

572
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,711
Looks like his promoter bought him a limo.
He bought his mum a house.

573
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,120
He bought a gun.

574
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,316
- This is kind of strange.
- What is it?

575
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,080
Bank statements. See all these deposits?

576
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,591
They're pretty regular over the past year.

577
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,912
All withdrawn from the same account,
all basically the same amount.

578
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,471
Until last month, he makes this
huge deposit from a cashier's cheque.

579
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,512
It sticks out like a sore thumb.

580
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,990
- Where's it come from?
- Hold on a sec.

581
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,594
There it is. New American Music.
Andre Haus, guarantor.

582
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,955
You're the best.

583
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,915
That's it?

584
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,230
- Janet called and....
- All right, go.

585
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,912
- What's up, man?
- How're you feeling?

586
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,151
- Thanks for seeing me.
- No problem.

587
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,991
You wanted to know
about this cheque, right?

588
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,874
$500,000, man.

589
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,716
Why?

590
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,512
'Cause Benji was about to sign
with New American Music...

591
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,752
after his contract with New Freedom ran out.
That's why.

592
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,239
- And B. Free found out about it?
- Apparently so.

593
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,631
I did everything in my power
to keep it from him.

594
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,431
Bobby Freeman isn't exactly the type
of brother whose shit list you want to be on.

595
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,119
Half of Benji's royalties
is going to a guy by the name of--

596
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,429
Armageddon.

597
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,877
- You know him?
- Yes. Good writer.

598
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,836
- What's his real name?
- That I don't know. Benji never told me.

599
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,713
So let me get this straight.

600
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,715
B. Free finds out
that you want to sign Benji.

601
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,474
Then he figures Benji is worth more to him
dead than alive, so he kills him.

602
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,471
Tell me,
what's the deal with this Demise guy?

603
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,231
Demise works for Funk U Up, man.

604
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,720
Funk U Up is a dummy corporation
owned by Bobby Freeman.

605
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,558
Demise and them were supposed
to get Benji to sign with them...

606
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,235
but they were too stupid to pull it off.

607
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,080
Benji's now dead.

608
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,956
Armageddon gets half of his royalties.

609
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,432
All B. Free has to do
is strong-arm Armageddon...

610
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,637
get him to sign over his half...

611
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,351
and he owns damn near
the whole smash, man.

612
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,155
I guess I gotta find this Armageddon first.

613
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,793
- Thank you.
- All right.

614
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,000
Hello, Lisa? What you got on, girl?

615
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,680
What's up? This is Rad. What's going on?

616
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,316
What?

617
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,400
- Lisa, what happened?
- When I woke up, she was gone.

618
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,472
- She didn't leave a note or anything?
- Nothing.

619
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,472
- Where's your keys?
- In the car.

620
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,879
What do you want me to do?

621
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,196
Get in.

622
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,634
I'm telling you,
girlfriend was just gone. Straight.

623
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,074
So Demise worked for B. Free
the whole time?

624
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,958
That's why he tried to kill me.

625
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,511
Venus told me about that.
So, who is this Armageddon?

626
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,796
That's the $10 million question.

627
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,512
I don't know, Lisa. This shit is crazy.
My best friend is dead.

628
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,751
Lady Wu Tang kicks my ass.

629
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,231
The worst rapper in the history
of the business tried to smoke me.

630
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,913
This just ain't my week.

631
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,471
- You didn't, Rad.
- What're you talking about?

632
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,712
That's cold. You mean you didn't know
that Tracy's the manager here?

633
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,678
- I didn't.
- You're lying.

634
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,956
- I swear to God--
- I know you're lying.

635
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,757
- What's up, Trace?
- What's up, man?

636
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,517
You didn't! You know
you're not supposed to be in here.

637
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,718
- I got a restraining order against you.
- Yes, you do.

638
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,360
I'll be in the car.

639
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,914
- Let me get the key, Trace.
- What key?

640
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,435
Don't play dumb with me.
The key to Benji's room.

641
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,193
I don't know what you're talking about.

642
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,034
- You don't know what I'm talking about?
- No.

643
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,115
Okay. You're talking about that key?

644
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,318
I thought you meant the key to life.
That key.

645
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,595
Give me the fucking key.

646
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,592
- Benji's key?
- Yeah, Benji's key.

647
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,320
She's supposed to stay
100 yards away from me.

648
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,637
You know, there's a bird in Africa
called the Whitetop.

649
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,792
A beautiful bird. It hunts smaller birds.

650
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,437
And when it catches it, it decapitates it.

651
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,951
And then it takes the bird's head
and hangs it from the branch for all to see.

652
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,640
You're lucky
this bird ain't hungry right now.

653
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,035
- What happened to you?
- Give me the surveillance tapes.

654
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,077
I don't know what you're talking about.

655
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,640
This ain't the time to be fucking with me.

656
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,796
I'll tell you, just like I told those detectives.

657
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,475
The tapes were gone
before the police even got here.

658
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,476
Breathe.

659
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,955
Whatever he said, he's lying.
I didn't know shit about them midgets.

660
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,832
Remind me to bring that up later.

661
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,958
But for right now,
I need you to run this invoice I found.

662
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,475
- What's it for?
- It's for a shipment of CDs.

663
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,554
- Benji was in the music industry.
- I know that, Lisa, but look at the total.

664
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,479
- That's a lot of money for 250 records.
- $52,000?

665
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,880
Okay, I'm on it.

666
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,400
- What are you going to do?
- I'm about to pay a visit to a little friend.

667
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,916
Take this.

668
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,640
- What is it?
- It's me looking out for your ass.

669
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,598
You call me if you need me, okay?

670
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,152
- Be careful.
- No doubt.

671
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,710
8619 Lankershim.

672
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,430
This is it?

673
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,792
This isn't Funk U Up Records.

674
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,431
<i>...Lady Wu Tang kicks my ass...</i>

675
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,679
Hey, Rad, this is Lisa. The address is fake.

676
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,878
I've got a lead that I'm following.
I'll fill you in later.

677
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,152
I'm Tammy Wong.
Here's a sample of what we do.

678
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,675
Come on, baby.

679
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,391
I know my CD player's working.

680
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,874
Oh, my God!

681
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,716
Baby.

682
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,120
I've got to go.

683
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,192
I've got to tell you something.

684
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,036
I'm pregnant.

685
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,519
You can't have that baby, baby.
I got a woman.

686
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,870
So?

687
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,830
I love you.

688
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,357
You know what?
Let me think about this for a second.

689
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,750
Are you seriously trying to tell me
you think Ginger's finer than Mary Ann?

690
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,320
You're fucking stupid?

691
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,274
What the fuck was that?

692
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,595
Go and see if the window's open.
Might be them damn mosquitoes again.

693
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,036
Damn!

694
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,274
What the fuck is this?

695
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,631
I don't know what I'm thinking...

696
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,199
but I want to ask you if....

697
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,510
Do you want to give me a massage?

698
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,830
Yes, I do.

699
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,636
All right!

700
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,996
I saw the way you were looking at me, boy.
I was like, yeah.

701
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,478
Them shoulders are soft.

702
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,832
- Like them tats?
- I like them tats, too.

703
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,192
You make me feel like a man!

704
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,230
Fuck it.

705
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,719
What was that? A.9?

706
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,997
That shit sounded like a.45 Grizzly.

707
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,878
- Fuck the guns.
- You know what I'm saying?

708
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,952
We are into non-violence tonight.

709
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,236
- You know, nigga?
- You bet.

710
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,110
Wait right here.

711
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,556
<i>I love you.</i>

712
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,675
Now! Go!

713
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,514
Do it, daddy.

714
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,029
Hell, no!

715
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,554
- Wanna sit here?
- Yes.

716
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,560
You want me to sit down?

717
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,438
Go get B. Bring him back here.

718
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,874
- Like this?
- That's right.

719
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,795
<i>Too late!</i>

720
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,320
Are you okay?

721
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,271
- Is your ass hot, too?
- Hell, yeah!

722
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,555
Come on.

723
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,629
You okay?

724
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,919
What are you doing?

725
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,871
It's just that I feel like
you're Benji's guardian angel.

726
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,197
I feel like you're mine, too.

727
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,359
How did they get you?

728
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,193
Fuck, I'm sorry.

729
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,790
I left Lisa's because I wanted to help and....

730
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,840
Shit! I guess they were following me
or something.

731
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,836
- What is it?
- I don't know, but it's Lisa though.

732
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,990
- I don't get it.
- I do.

733
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,074
Benji's pager.

734
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,194
It's Armageddon.

735
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,793
- What?
- I gotta go.

736
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,033
All right, take this.

737
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,115
- You know how to use one of these?
- No.

738
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,556
- Just point and shoot.
- Okay.

739
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,551
All right?

740
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,636
Lock the door.

741
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,351
<i>I got to Armageddon before you did, Rad.</i>

742
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,480
<i>If you want to see him alive,
warehouse, Pier 27 at 6:00 a.m.</i>

743
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,756
<i>I'll give you what you want,
you give me that tape.</i>

744
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,435
<i>Oh yeah, this tape is blowing in 10. Out.</i>

745
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,869
Blackie Chan up in this motherfucker.

746
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,358
Fucking door was open.

747
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,959
Where's Armageddon?

748
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,113
Where are my tapes?

749
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,919
Them nuts is clean.

750
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,630
No, they're not.

751
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,156
Asshole.

752
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,554
Go check them out.

753
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,713
Where's Armageddon?

754
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,630
I hope you ain't trying
to get smart with me, Rad.

755
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,519
Make a few copies for the boys
down in the squad room.

756
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,513
- No time.
- No cops outside waiting for me, right?

757
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,592
You destroyed the evidence.

758
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,712
I was smooth, wasn't I?
I mean you gotta gimme that.

759
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,036
But I tell you, if you're lying...

760
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,591
- he's dead.
- I feel you. Now what?

761
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,151
Just so we're clear.
I mean, you know, just so we're clear.

762
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,956
I tell you,
you really should be working for me, Rad.

763
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,279
- I mean, we'll make a hell of a team.
- Fuck you!

764
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,951
You kill my best friend,
and you want me to become your partner?

765
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,194
You still think this is about record sales?

766
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,989
Maybe. Maybe it's about heroin.

767
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,312
That's your real business, right?
Imprinting heroin on CDs.

768
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,360
Selling heroin on CDs make this whole thing
legal for you, don't it?

769
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,995
Now you got accounting records
and everything.

770
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,150
You see the beauty of the whole thing?

771
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:11,319
It's just supplied to the entire West Coast,
and nobody thinks a thing.

772
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,314
Your shit was hot...

773
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,350
till I took out your main supplier.

774
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,678
Those dogs were doing pretty good
until you came along.

775
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,273
Almost fucked up my whole operation.

776
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:40,437
Looks like she's getting ready
to whup your ass, my brother.

777
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,279
My momma always taught me
to never hit a woman.

778
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,151
But, bitch, you ain't got your papers.
I'm about to fuck you up.

779
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,675
I need to ask you one question
before I take you in.

780
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,400
- Why did you do it?
- So, we're back to this?

781
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,873
Why I killed Benji?

782
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,589
You're smart, Rad. I'll give you that.

783
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,639
See, I knew if you took the case...

784
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,549
and got your little emotions involved...

785
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,838
the last thing you would be thinking about
was drugs.

786
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,279
Benji's dead for one reason,
and one reason only:

787
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,038
- because he was your friend.
- Shut up!

788
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,357
Nice and easy, Aaron Neville.

789
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,396
It's good. That's the tape.

790
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,235
You're the man.

791
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,871
Just out of curiosity, Rad,
did you have a look at the tape?

792
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,554
And what did you see?

793
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,678
- I saw you leaving the scene of the crime.
- You did?

794
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,594
- So you're positive I killed Benji?
- You tell me.

795
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,035
I would...

796
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,354
but then that would ruin the other surprise.

797
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,992
- What the hell is this?
- You don't even know, do you?

798
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,634
This is Armageddon.
What, you don't believe me?

799
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,353
Rap, motherfucker!

800
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,159
<i>I got bitches on my dick
'cause I rock the hits</i>

801
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,959
<i>drive the whips, stack the chips</i>

802
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,794
<i>I'm a professor of Philosophy

803
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,191
<i>Your big black ass is history
Fuck you, motherfucker!</i>

804
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,912
See, change up a few things...

805
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:31,271
add a sample or two, and you got...

806
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,635
a hit.

807
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,513
Drop the gun, B.

808
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,512
No, motherfucker. I think you got it wrong.

809
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,714
I think you're the motherfucker
who needs to drop the gun.

810
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,350
Bet you didn't see this one coming.

811
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,593
Venus, what are you doing?

812
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,878
I should get an Oscar for that acting job.

813
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,193
I mean, the tears, and I was crying.

814
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,796
Baby, I think he was
starting to fall for me a little bit.

815
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,432
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

816
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,394
So, what are you gonna do?

817
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,520
You pull that trigger, he dies,
and so do you.

818
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,398
You know, I actually can't believe
you made it this far.

819
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,598
It's too bad and so sad
I can't say the same for Lisa.

820
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,716
What about Lisa?

821
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,440
Caught that bitch
slipping outside her garage.

822
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,435
I shot her.

823
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,560
Two shots, point-blank range.

824
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,671
Pulled the trigger on Benji, too, didn't you?

825
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,231
Yeah, I did, but that was easy.
I fucking hate rap.

826
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,518
See? I told you, Rad.

827
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,873
I ain't no killer.

828
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,479
I'm a businessman.

829
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,038
But this bitch right here, this bitch is crazy.

830
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,390
I thought you loved him.

831
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,439
Loved him?
Baby, I didn't even fucking know him.

832
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,716
What?

833
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,317
Where did you get your P.I. license?
In a cereal box?

834
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,560
Bring her in.

835
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,400
Venus, this is Rad.

836
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,792
Baby, what are you doing?

837
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,476
Let me break it down for you.
With you gone, I can run the whole show...

838
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,677
and the Asians will deal directly with me.

839
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:32,549
So I just don't think
there's any room for you anymore.

840
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,634
Bitch, you've done lost
your motherfucking mind!

841
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,038
- Shit!
- Oh, look. I'm sorry.

842
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,719
I'm fucking with you.

843
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,439
Why are you running?

844
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,719
Come out, it's your turn.
Take it like a fucking man!

845
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,318
Now look at this shit.

846
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:15,158
Big, bad Rad just killed an innocent man.

847
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,834
Get out here!

848
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,718
Nobody ever had to look for me.

849
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,431
- You're messing with the wrong cat now.
- You having a party without me?

850
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,160
I knew I should've checked your vitals,
gadget bitch!

851
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,994
Would have, should have, could have, bitch.

852
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,594
- Follow my lead.
- Better know what you're talking about.

853
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,398
So smart. See now, that was easy.

854
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,597
I just want to have a good view, that's all.

855
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,319
- View for what?
- This.

856
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,116
Sometimes PMS can blow your mind.

857
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,475
That little slut shot me twice
when I wasn't looking.

858
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,870
Shocked me a little bit,
but that was all right.

859
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,953
It gave me a chance
to try out my new bullet-proof vest.

860
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,112
It was something about her ass.
I never trusted her.

861
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,680
Woman's instinct.

862
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,716
How the hell did you get a bomb on her?

863
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,792
Girls borrow stuff from each other
all the time.

864
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,519
- Not the--
- Tampons!

865
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,633
- What?
- I'm done with you.

866
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,677
I told you they would work.

867
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,078
What have we got here?

868
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,473
- You all right?
- Yeah. How did you like my flow?

869
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,910
- I don't know what to say.
- I'm just glad you're okay.

870
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,877
- Anything she needs, okay?
- Thank you.

871
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,873
We'll be in touch.

872
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:14,836
Is it over?

873
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,271
- Did we win?
- At the buzzer.

874
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,473
Why did you shoot me?

875
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,632
It was the only way I could save you.

876
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,519
Don't worry, I didn't hit anything important.

877
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,270
Thanks for--

878
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,556
Save your strength.
You're gonna need it later.

879
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,359
Benji would be very proud.

880
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,760
- Hey, man, I'm just doing my job.
- All right.

881
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,952
To the Batcave, Alfred.

882
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:43,831
<i>I'm a professor of Philosophy
of sexual veracity, 'cause I rock the hits</i>

883
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,240
So, what now?

884
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,594
Got a championship at the Y
in a couple hours. I mean, right now.

885
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,636
Thanks.

886
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,160
Ain't nothing to talk about. See you later.

887
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,560
I'm catching a cramp in my leg and my hand.

888
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,235
Do you know
how to ride one of these things?

889
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,394
Of course I do. The question is
do you know how to ride one of these?

890
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,990
Can't believe you're still doing
that high school shit. Catchin' a cramp.

891
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,719
Yeah, but it works.

892
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,592
I prefer a stick, but I guess this will do.

893
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,956
Hop on.

894
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,512
- Get on the bike.
- All right.

895
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,114
- Eight seconds.
- I'm up here. Go get 'em.

896
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,997
- Okay, eight seconds.
- Nice of you to show up.

897
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,311
Look here. This is what we're gonna do.

898
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,278
Kyle, I need you to bring the ball up.

899
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,319
J.R., I need you to set a pick right here
on the free throw line.

900
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,552
Randall, I need you to come around,
come off this screen.

901
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,758
Kyle, I need you to give him a good pass.
We win the game, okay?

902
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,435
Coach, I've been off today
and Kyle's been filling it up.

903
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,671
Can I bring up the ball
and he run off the pick?

904
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,070
All right, you guys swap positions.

905
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,994
Randall, I need you to give him
a good pass, okay?

906
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,309
- Done.
- All right, good.

907
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,516
On three, together.

908
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,592
1, 2, 3, together!

909
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,675
Come on.

910
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,518
You can do it.
Make me proud. Come on, now!

911
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,429
Randall, I need you
to make that good pass for me!

912
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,079
<i>The ball-hogging coach...</i>

913
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,758
won a championship for the Y.

914
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,037
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

915
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,590
I brought you a little something.

916
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,596
'Cause as long as there's a me,
there's a you.
