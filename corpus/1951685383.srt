1
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,311
I didn't go to school today.

2
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,194
Well, if only to ask my teacher
to let me go home

3
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,435
I gave him father's letter

4
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,631
in which he asked for it
referring to family reasons.

5
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,353
He asked what the reason was.

6
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,473
I told him father had been
called up for forced labor.

7
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,876
He left it at that.

8
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,272
I went straight to our shop.

9
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,517
Father said he'd be waiting there.

10
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,795
Hello, my friend.

11
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,110
That's a fine decoration
you've got there.

12
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,558
You won't have to wear it for long,
this outrage will be over soon.

13
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,556
Did your teacher let you go?

14
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,558
Yes. I said you'd been called up
for forced labor.

15
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,194
- And?
- He let me go.

16
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,238
So, that's the warehouse
settled, Mr. Sütõ.

17
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,875
Things go smoothly between
old acquaintances, Mr. Köves.

18
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,310
Maybe we should get
rid of everything

19
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,716
before the authorities lay
their hands on the whole outfit.

20
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,594
Prices have never been
this high!

21
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,519
I'll leave it to you.
I know I can trust you.

22
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,078
Well then... it'd be best

23
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,714
to hand over the goods right away.

24
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,751
Goods?

25
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,431
Of course, the goods!

26
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,869
I should give you a receipt.

27
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,911
Oh, come on, Mr. Sütõ...

28
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,474
We don't need anything
like that.

29
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,795
I know you trust me, Mr. Köves,

30
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,435
but there's a proper way
to do things.

31
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,711
Isn't that right, Mrs. Köves?

32
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,595
Anyway we'll be
in constant touch.

33
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,999
To do the accounts
if nothing else.

34
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,670
We are counting on your help
and experience.

35
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,351
Just as we have these past years.

36
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,789
Goodbye and good luck.

37
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,991
All I can say is, Mr. Köves...

38
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,633
I'll see you very soon.

39
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,035
I hope so too.

40
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,478
One thing less to worry about.

41
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,035
Shouldn't we have taken
the receipt?

42
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,837
There's no point when even
the lawful authorities rob us.

43
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,314
Did you call the jewelry "goods"
for my sake?

44
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,351
I know what's in that box.

45
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,233
It's secret, understand?

46
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,558
Hello, yes, it's me.

47
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,673
I'm sorry, I can't let you
see him today.

48
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,239
I'd like him to be with me
on this last day...

49
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,511
...before I leave home.

50
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,996
You're 14 and a half now.

51
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,592
I know your father can count on you
to behave properly on this sad day.

52
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,710
Your mother's on the line.

53
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,640
No, I can't. It's his last day.
You heard.

54
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,508
Of course, Monday. Right.

55
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,552
I won't be needing these any more.

56
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,270
- Are you hungry?
- Terribly.

57
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,598
You've hardly taken any.

58
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,960
I can't eat a thing.

59
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,798
You mustn't despair.

60
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,199
I'll miss you.

61
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,390
You'll be on your own.

62
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,749
But I won't.

63
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,593
We'll take care of each other
till you come home.

64
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,837
- Won't we, Gyurka?
- Yes.

65
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,072
Just go on. Eat.

66
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,875
I'm not hungry.

67
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,151
- Hello.
- Hello.

68
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,997
Don't! Stupid!

69
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,838
What about last night,
during the air-raid?

70
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,950
When we went back in the attic?
And heard the bombs?

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,913
I was just scared.
And you took advantage.

72
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,832
Are you angry?

73
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,078
Can you come this afternoon?
For a game of cards.

74
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,749
- Yeah. Oh, no I can't.
- Why?

75
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,554
My father's been called up
for forced labor.

76
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,989
Aha. And tomorrow?

77
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,875
Let's make it the day after.
Maybe.

78
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,431
Oh, how dreadful it all is.

79
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,188
What has the world come to?

80
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,637
- My son.
- Oh, mother, do sit down.

81
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,797
- Are you going away?
- That's quite crowded.

82
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,593
- What's happening?
- I'll tell you.

83
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,074
- Yes...
- That's right. There.

84
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,033
Yes....but over there...

85
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,831
Nothing's happening.
We're not eating yet.

86
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,233
Secret negotiations are under way.

87
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,396
I can't tell you more than that.

88
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,829
This is completely
reliable information.

89
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,997
Just as reliable
as your racing tips

90
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,076
which I regularly lose on.

91
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,511
Before Vili opened his betting shop,
he was one of the best

92
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,632
stock exchange correspondents.

93
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,231
The Germans realize their situation
at the front is hopeless.

94
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,919
They're using us Budapest Jews

95
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,078
to squeeze concessions
out of the Allies.

96
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,031
And the mass executions in Poland?

97
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,435
That's different!
Poland isn't Hungary.

98
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,392
- And the ghettos in the countryside?
- A sensational bluff!

99
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,670
To raise the stakes.

100
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,712
So I shouldn't even bother
to report to the labor camp?

101
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,274
Perhaps it's a bluff too.

102
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,108
Well, no....
I wouldn't advise that

103
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,948
But I'm sure you'll be home soon.

104
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,437
We're being used as part of a huge
blackmail at the moment.

105
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,552
The negotiations
will soon bear fruit.

106
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,432
If I were as sure of my tips
as I am of that,

107
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,869
I wouldn't be the pauper I am!

108
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,718
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Of course. A bit later.

109
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,994
I'd like a little talk with you.

110
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,235
- Your father's leaving tomorrow.
- I know.

111
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,236
I'm sure you also know
that your carefree

112
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,636
childhood days are over.

113
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,156
You too are part
of the common Jewish fate now.

114
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,677
You know what that Jewish fate means?

115
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,074
Well, the yellow star,
for instance.

116
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,078
And much else besides.

117
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,433
Thousands of years of relentless
persecution, which we must bear

118
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,156
- with patience and resignation.
- Why?

119
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,239
Because God inflicted it on us
for our sins,

120
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,114
and only from Him
can we expect mercy.

121
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,312
- Have you prayed for your Father?
- No.

122
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,549
It worried me that I didn't understand
what we were saying to God.

123
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,592
I think I mixed up the words a bit.

124
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,871
But by the end of the prayer
I felt

125
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,549
we had managed to do something
for father.

126
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,476
My name's Steiner.

127
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,238
Good evening, gentlemen.

128
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,316
Mr. Steiner and Mr. Fleischmann,
our neighbors..

129
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,670
Please don't get up,
we've come to say goodbye.

130
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,712
Every evening we review the war,

131
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,832
of which I'll be a part
from tomorrow.

132
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,000
Just keep your chin down, old boy,
and never lose your despair!

133
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,036
Don't worry, we'll take care of
your wife and Gyurka.

134
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,117
Carry on with your meal.

135
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,359
No, it's pork!

136
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,109
That's all I could get
on the black market.

137
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,995
Believe me...

138
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,828
Things will change radically soon.

139
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,952
May the Almighty help us

140
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,152
to be able to sit round
the family table again soon

141
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,512
in love, peace and health!

142
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,675
It's late, Gyurka.

143
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,792
I don't want to wake you at dawn.

144
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,794
I may come back one day.

145
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,992
Till then...
Iook after each other.

146
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,995
Your mother may try to take advantage
that I'm not with you.

147
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,555
She may try to lure you away.

148
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,670
But you know where you belong.

149
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,999
Your stepmother made a home for
you, whereas your mother left us.

150
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,679
You must stand by her.

151
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,348
I'll write to you,

152
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,599
and you write too, Gyurka.

153
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,396
Son!

154
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,633
His hug came unexpectedly.

155
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,070
I don't know whether that
was what made me cry,

156
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,156
or simply exhaustion,

157
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,637
or maybe it was because ever since
my stepmother hinted at it,

158
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,716
I had been preparing myself

159
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,911
that at a certain moment
you were expected to cry.

160
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,713
I'm glad
it happened the way it did,

161
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,320
and I felt father was pleased too.

162
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,271
After that he sent me to bed.

163
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,595
I was pretty tired by then,

164
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,760
but I thought that at least we were
sending him off to labor camp

165
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,394
with the memory of a fine day.

166
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,950
There's a war on...

167
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,516
I'm alone...

168
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,074
I miss you.

169
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,435
You know it was father's
decision, not mine.

170
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,471
But it is about you now.

171
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,629
Do you love me?

172
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,116
Of course I do.

173
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,233
Then why do you insist on
staying with that woman?

174
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,874
I don't insist on it, but...

175
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,957
One can't prove love by words.

176
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,675
- I don't think you really love me.
- That's not true.

177
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,314
It's your argument
your's and father's.

178
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,033
And I can't go against father now,

179
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,277
when he's in a labor camp.

180
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,917
Go now.

181
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,190
The curfew'll be in force soon.

182
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,315
It doesn't apply to me.
I've got a pass.

183
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,231
So, you're starting tomorrow.

184
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,669
I'm so glad he's got a pass.

185
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,188
You're right, dear.

186
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,471
I hear of nothing but raids,
people disappearing.

187
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,397
Stop being a prophet of doom!

188
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,352
It's no good sticking your head
in the sand either.

189
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,196
And what does our friend
write about?

190
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,312
What they allow him.

191
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,118
That he's healthy,

192
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,914
he can cope with the work,
the treatment is humane.

193
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,269
But what's he saying
between the lines?

194
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,471
As long as the letters come
regularly there's no problem.

195
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,829
At least he writes.

196
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,114
And how are you going to get
to work?

197
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,912
With the local train, I suppose?

198
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,872
You'll mislead the boy.

199
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,036
He must take the bus.

200
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,435
So, train or bus?

201
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,516
- Train.
- Bus.

202
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,677
The bus stops right by
the entrance to the oil plant.

203
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,473
If you listen to him
you'll have a long walk.

204
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,317
- Train!
- Bus!

205
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,399
God knows everything,
but Steiner knows better. Train!

206
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,475
Bus!

207
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,272
- Train!
- Bus!

208
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,150
We were just talking about you.
What exactly do you do there?

209
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,839
I mix mortar and pass bricks.

210
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,075
Oh, bricklaying.

211
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,998
Well, who would have thought it?

212
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,429
- Are you hungry?
- Fairly.

213
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,676
I'll be going then.

214
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,234
How can I thank you, Mr. Sütõ.

215
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,669
Don't mention it, Mrs. Köves.

216
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,359
A promise is a promise.

217
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,078
And do tell your husband
he can always count on me.

218
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,391
Oh, yes.

219
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,591
I've read about the new laws.

220
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,756
Disgraceful.

221
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,278
What's this?

222
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,678
A small gift.

223
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,473
I can't accept it, Mr. Sütõ.

224
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,799
Don't treat me like a stranger,
Mrs. Köves.

225
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,348
D'you think I should have
refused it?

226
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,229
I'm going to Annamária's
to play cards.

227
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,716
- You haven't eaten yet.
- When I get back.

228
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,989
Anything wrong? No cards?

229
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,598
I've got a headache.

230
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,200
The yellow star made it ache.

231
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,958
She's been on about it
all afternoon.

232
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,070
- What?
- That people hate her.

233
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,752
I said I wouldn't care if they hated
me if I could see the sense in it!

234
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,949
I don't understand a thing.

235
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,390
- So people don't hate you?
- Who would hate me?

236
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,078
- Everyone.
- But why?

237
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,348
Because of this!

238
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,278
Oh, that? Well, they may hate me...

239
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,517
But I don't think it's me
they hate.

240
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,358
Not me personally,
just in general.

241
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,470
They hate in general?

242
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,192
In general, yes.

243
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,916
Not you, not me,
but... the idea of a Jew.

244
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,475
Great. Because I for one
don't really know what that is.

245
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,159
- What what is?
- Being a Jew.

246
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,919
- Everyone knows that!
- It's a religion.

247
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,554
But I'm interested in
what it means.

248
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,718
All I know is, It's a difference,
separating us.from other people.

249
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,036
As if you were the one to decide
on the difference

250
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,911
and not the thing you're wearing.

251
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,349
I don't wear
the difference here,

252
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,630
it's inside me.

253
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,878
But I don't know whether
to be proud it or ashamed.

254
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,751
You shouldn't be either.

255
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,590
Then what's the point of wearing
this rotten yellow star?

256
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,313
There's no point,

257
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,511
no point...

258
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,557
No point...

259
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,350
Attention!
Those with yellow stars get off!

260
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,039
Anyone with a yellow star?

261
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,992
- Anyone with a yellow star?
- Yes.

262
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,508
Get off then.

263
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,435
- I'm war labor.
- Right. Get off.

264
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,631
You can come!

265
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,990
- Didn't he accept it?
- No.

266
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,953
- What happened to you lot?
- He didn't accept ours either.

267
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,118
Back behind the embankment.
Off you go! Hurry! One-two!

268
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,238
That's it.

269
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,992
Anyone with a yellow star get off.

270
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,273
Come here!

271
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,949
- Hey, kids, Rozi's here!
- Where? Really?

272
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,389
Did you show your passes?

273
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,556
We have to be at the Schell
Refinery by seven.

274
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,110
- Well, you'll be late today.
- Why?

275
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,357
Because I'm going to arrest you.

276
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,396
Back behind the embankment!

277
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,796
Get down! At the double!
One-two! Get down!

278
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,868
There, there! That's it!
Lie down! Lie down!

279
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,269
- Why's he arresting us?
- I reckon he's just fooling around.

280
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,995
So what if we're late?
We get off work.

281
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,631
What the devil am l
going to do with you lot?

282
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,797
Sorry, but I can't help you there.

283
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,472
Ask him!

284
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,035
But when are you
going to let us go?

285
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,476
Wish I knew myself.

286
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,675
Wait a minute, I'll be back soon.

287
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,432
Yes, Yes! But what shall we do?
. What shall I say?

288
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,311
He's phoning.

289
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,113
- Can you hear?
- Not if you jabber.

290
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,196
The foreman must be wondering.

291
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,391
It's not our fault.
The cop will explain it all.

292
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,274
We've got
to wait for further orders.

293
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,112
You look like educated boys.

294
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,869
For instance... d'you know
the game Blind Man's Bum?

295
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,030
- Who was it?
- Moskovics.

296
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,957
No.

297
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,908
Good morning, Foreman.

298
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,078
So it's true.
I hear you took them off the bus.

299
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,237
These boys have been
assigned to work for me.

300
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,716
- I know, I've seen their passes.
- Then let them go immediately!

301
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,150
You think I'm keeping them here
for fun? I've got orders.

302
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,589
These boys are in my care.

303
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,792
What shall I tell their mothers
if they don't go home?

304
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,276
This is an lD check.
Their papers are in order.

305
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,118
They'll be going home.
Understand?

306
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,798
Can't you see they're just kids?

307
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,150
Have you no sense of responsibility
as a policeman?

308
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,273
Another word,
and I'll lock you up wi.th them.

309
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,232
Show me your papers!

310
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,234
Stuff the papers...!

311
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,789
Well now...

312
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,989
Carry on.

313
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,114
Good old foreman.
He showed him!

314
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,913
- Who wants to play jacks?
- How d'you play?

315
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,111
You grab a handful of stones,
throw them up

316
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,072
and the one who catches
the most wins.

317
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,838
Look!

318
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,877
I'm expected
at a board meeting today.

319
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,798
I'm essential
to aircraft production.

320
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,512
You'll carry on tomorrow.

321
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,757
I heard you phoning.
Could I possibly make a call?

322
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,998
I'm sorry,
it's for official use only.

323
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,159
Incredible.

324
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,397
You're somebody, aren't you?

325
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,829
What'll happen to us?

326
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,838
Don't worry. Things'll be
cleared up sooner or later.

327
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,472
He's just an ordinary policeman.

328
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,432
I wanted to visit
my sick mother...

329
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,278
It took me three days
to get the permission.

330
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,949
But today I had to go
to the office first...

331
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,829
I wanted to visit
my sick mother.

332
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,997
It took three days
to get the pass.

333
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,110
Here it is.

334
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,038
Expires at two o'clock
this afternoon.

335
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,234
But I had to go somewhere on business
first and there was a queue.

336
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,751
By the time I was through I only
had two and a half hours left...

337
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,473
To leave or not to leave...

338
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,750
I left!

339
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,197
Because mummy was expecting me.

340
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,355
But if I'd just missed
the midday bus...

341
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,995
Five minutes,

342
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,472
Five minutes.

343
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,390
- Still not interested?
- No. Here.

344
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,238
Thanks.

345
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,317
Well, my orders have come.

346
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,388
Just a simple lD check.
Line up outside!

347
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,194
Come on! Get a move on! In line!

348
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,392
Come on! Get moving!

349
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,356
No stargazing. Move!

350
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,837
Faster!

351
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,276
Jews!

352
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,553
There'll be an investigation
into your affairs tomorrow!

353
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,036
Don't have any hopes that you can
hide your ill-gotten gains

354
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,753
or your black market goods!

355
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,918
Now herd this whole Jewish
mob where they belong -

356
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,394
into the stables!

357
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,436
Get a move on! Move along!
Faster!

358
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,833
Stinking Jews!

359
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,431
We saw you signaling
to the British planes

360
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,397
with candles.
We'll blast you all to bits!

361
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,552
Will it drop or won't it?
That was the question.

362
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,115
I just had to recognize
the pittance of the stake

363
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,833
so that I too could enjoy the game.

364
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,158
I was beginning to grasp
the simple secret of my universe,

365
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,752
I could be killed
anywhere, any time.

366
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,677
Next.

367
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,593
Got your papers?

368
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,632
Empty your pockets!

369
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,272
The watch too.

370
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,598
Go on.

371
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,390
That's my penknife.

372
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,990
You haven't looked at my pass.

373
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,828
- Your what?
- My pass.

374
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,595
One way or another
sooner or later

375
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,952
everyone from this brick works
will be relocated to Germany.

376
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,595
Those who volunteer now
will travel 60 to a carriage.

377
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,555
Later there'll be 80,
and later still even more.

378
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,034
So, volunteer now, right?

379
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,150
I'm afraid we're short of trains.

380
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,915
- Will families stay together?
- Yes, families stay together.

381
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,633
- The luggage?
- Yes, luggage too, everything.

382
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,831
We have to get tomorrow's
transport ready.

383
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,190
It's best if we sort it out
among ourselves...

384
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,390
Shall we go?

385
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,228
...rather than have gendarmes
shove you into the wagons.

386
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,592
Anything's better than
these rotten gendarmes!

387
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,515
I'm joining you young ones
to cheer myself up a bit.

388
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,472
Are you volunteering?

389
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,957
- We're not sure yet.
- Nor am l.

390
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,958
Will it be better there?

391
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,918
What d'you suggest?

392
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,999
Get healed yourself first.
You've still got a black eye.

393
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,476
They accused me of profiteering.

394
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,958
Yet I told them I wanted to take
medicines to my sick mother.

395
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,117
Five minutes changed everything.

396
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,277
The Germans are a cultured race.

397
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,437
The camps in Poland
are culture itself...

398
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,869
Don't spread rumors, please.

399
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,878
You know as much as I do -
nothing.

400
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,478
Rumors!

401
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,115
I've heard nothing but rumors
about the Germans so far,

402
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,039
- and they were all true.
- So you're not going?

403
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,435
Could you tell me exactly why not?

404
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,677
What is it you know?
What are the rumors?

405
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,438
Could you put me on the list.

406
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,675
- Name, please.
- lstván Gõz.

407
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,589
D'you hear that? He's signed up,
and he's... some big shot.

408
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,076
He was talking to a German officer.
I saw him with my own eyes.

409
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,112
A real German officer?

410
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,229
He's got pluck.

411
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,998
I went up to him.

412
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,998
I wanted to talk to
someone in authority.

413
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,352
- And did he speak to you?
- Why ask, you saw him!

414
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,756
I'm an engineer.
I speak perfect German.

415
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,920
I told him my work had been made
morally and physically impossible.

416
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,679
I'm not seeking advantages
or privileges,

417
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,359
but I'm an expert in my field
and I'd like to work...

418
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,516
And? What did he say?

419
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,599
He didn't make any big promises.

420
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,760
But he said Germany was
in need of experts like myself.

421
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,678
And what's the guarantee?

422
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,478
The difference between the objective
words of a high-ranking German officer

423
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,389
and this mob who can't even grasp
what's in their own interest.

424
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,989
And my judgment of character.

425
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,309
Without hope you are lost.

426
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,148
And you can draw hope
only from faith.

427
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,034
The time of His victory shall come,

428
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,994
and all those who have
forgotten His power

429
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,077
will be one in repentance

430
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,317
and call out to him
from the dust...

431
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,189
One can survive three to four days.

432
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,800
But you mustn't eat.

433
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,593
Especially not meat
and spicy things.

434
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,393
What if you're hungry?

435
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,150
You can choose - hunger or thirst.

436
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,910
It depends how long
the journey is.

437
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,953
Water!

438
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,235
People!
You've reached the Hungarian border.

439
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,271
The last time
you'll hear Hungarian,

440
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,359
and I'm speaking to you
man to man.

441
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,029
If anyone has any money, valuables
or anything else,

442
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,231
hand it over to me now.

443
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,229
You won't need any valuables
where you're going.

444
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,319
The Germans'll take it from you
anything you've hidden.

445
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,990
Surely you'd rather leave things
in Hungarian hands?

446
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,191
You're Hungarians too after all.

447
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,800
Son of a bitch!

448
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,110
Water. We should get him
to give us water...

449
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,720
All right.

450
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,753
Give us water in exchange.

451
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,392
Water?

452
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,912
It's forbidden officially. But
I'll steal some from the well...

453
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,474
How much?

454
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,239
Depends what you give.

455
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,158
You'll soon see what you get,
you won't be disappointed.

456
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,830
Why make an effort for you
when it may not even be worth it?

457
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,599
Give me something first.

458
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,918
Give us
two buckets of water first.

459
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,633
Do I get something or not?

460
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,477
Stinking Jews!

461
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,718
Still want to turn the most
sacred things into business!

462
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,039
You're even taking your last
pennies to the Germans.

463
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,152
Well die of thirst then!

464
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,433
Die of thirst!
Die of thirst!

465
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,113
I keep thinking of what that
gendarme said four days ago.

466
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,878
What did he say?

467
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,152
That we won't need anything
where we're going...

468
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,556
Where are we going?

469
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:28,348
- Can you see anything?
- A station building. I think.

470
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,988
- Any name on it?
- Yes. A-usch-witz-Bir-ke-nau...

471
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,877
Does anyone know where...

472
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,514
- What did you say?
- Auschwitz-Birkenau.

473
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,512
I've never heard of the place.

474
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,393
And you're a geography teacher!

475
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,512
I could follow the route
through Slovakia,

476
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,157
we were going
in a north easterly direction.

477
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,158
I'd say we're in Poland now.

478
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,749
But the Germans have renamed
all the places here.

479
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,112
Clever dicks, they've been trying
to work it out for four days now.

480
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,478
Wake up! We may have arrived.

481
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,234
Sixteen! Sixteen!

482
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,954
- We're sixteen.
- I know.

483
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,470
You're sixteen too, Moskovics.

484
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,035
How old are you?

485
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,631
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen... work...

486
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,356
How old are you?

487
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,550
Sixteen.

488
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,551
Hello, Köves.
We made it! Great!

489
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,716
I'm not surprised. There were
gas chambers back home too.

490
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,876
Rubbish!

491
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,595
I didn't know there were gas chambers,
but I always had a feeling.

492
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,996
I knew they were hiding the truth.

493
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,600
We're all gonna die.

494
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:45,069
We're not. This is Auschwitz.
Extermination camp.

495
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,999
But they said we'd be taken
to an Arbeitslager,

496
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,238
...a labor camp.
That's different.

497
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,511
Poor Moskovics...

498
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:03,477
He may have been small...
he wore glasses... he was Jewish...

499
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,751
but I liked him...

500
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,912
We should have studied
nothing but Auschwitz.

501
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,396
They taught us: "Dear boy,

502
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,955
when you grow up
you'll go to Auschwitz,

503
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,279
they'll stuff you in a gas
chamber and burn you nicely."

504
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,438
I've heard they're
very kind to them to the end,

505
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,075
surrounding them
with care and affection.

506
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,476
And the place where
they suffocate them

507
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,832
is in a pretty garden
with grass, trees and flowers...

508
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,193
Buchenwald lies
on the top of a hilly region.

509
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,357
The air's clean.
You can see forests all around

510
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,279
and the red rooftops
of the village houses.

511
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,754
The baths are to the left.

512
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,270
They write your name in a big book
and you get a yellow triangle

513
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,471
and a wide strip of canvass.

514
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,559
There's a "U" in the triangle
to show you're Hungarian

515
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,637
and a number on the canvas strip.

516
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,678
Mine is 64921.

517
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,714
I was told to learn to say it
quickly and clearly in German:

518
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,593
Vier-und-sechzig, neun,
ein-und-zwanzig

519
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,509
because that's my answer
if anyone asks who I am.

520
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,437
Attention! Herr Capo asks
if there are any performers,

521
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,359
cultural groups or the like
who could entertain

522
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,119
while they organize the transport?

523
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,035
- The Kolmanns.
- The Kolmanns? The Kolmanns!

524
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,115
A piano!

525
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,993
Eisemann, Zágon:
"On a Moonlit Night."

526
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,476
What does a girl dream

527
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,638
On a moonlit night

528
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,150
That her prince will come

529
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:11,274
On a steed of pure white

530
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,791
It's a dream so sweet

531
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,470
But soon she must wake

532
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,273
And princes are scarce

533
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,599
So it's all a mistake

534
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:37,036
And yet such little clouds
are floating in the sky

535
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:45,272
While we can see them
our hopes won't pass us by

536
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,711
What does a girl dream

537
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,197
On a moonlit night

538
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,391
That her prince will come

539
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,468
On a steed of pure white

540
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,470
There's nothing more exhausting
than the tiresome process

541
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:44,038
we have to go through every time
we get to a new camp.

542
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,234
After Auschwitz and Buchenwald
it was the same at Zeitz too.

543
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,512
I realized right away that
this was a small, poor,

544
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,109
you could say provincial
concentration camp.

545
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:02,996
Showers and crematoriums
were only in more important camps.

546
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,318
The sole point of the endless
counting and shoving

547
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:12,434
was to get everyone out
in front of their block.

548
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,075
I looked around for the other boys,

549
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:20,557
but I was surrounded by strangers.

550
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,311
Where're you from?

551
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,271
From Budapest.

552
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,510
Are you from Budapest?

553
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,189
Is the Grand Boulevard still there?
What about the Number 6 tram?

554
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,153
- And Nefelejcs Street?
- I haven't been there for ages.

555
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,273
Nor me. Not for four years.
It's my home.

556
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:24,030
One day I'll walk
those streets again!

557
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,594
How did you end up here?

558
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,632
I was taken off the bus.

559
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,037
- How d'you mean?
- I had to get off. The cops.

560
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,514
Cops?

561
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,348
- They sent you here?
- Course.

562
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,676
Don't you know
what's up at home?

563
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,190
My name's Bandi. Bandi Citrom.

564
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:51,313
I told you I spent four years doing
forced labor in the Ukraine.

565
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,079
- You didn't tell me.
- Well I am now.

566
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,712
What were you doing there?

567
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,479
Digging up land mines
like the other kikes.

568
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,112
How?

569
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,913
If we have time I'll show you.

570
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,590
You need a spade and a bit of wire.
And luck. Plenty of it.

571
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,232
And?

572
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,033
Fucking bastard!

573
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,233
- Did it hurt?
- Not a bit.

574
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,510
Wipe your nose.
Tip your head back.

575
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,394
Why you not quiet?
Bring us trouble...

576
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,510
- Don't answer him.
- Who's he?

577
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,438
- Not one of us.
- But he speaks Hungarian.

578
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,359
He's from Latvia.
Orthodox.

579
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,871
- That other dude has to be a faggot.
- What d'you mean?

580
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,629
Never mind.
Like a circus trainer.

581
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,796
And that cheap scent...

582
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,229
Where the hell does he get it?
Isn't he a prisoner?

583
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,559
No. He's one of the camp bosses.
Did you see his green triangle?

584
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,477
I did.

585
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,718
- That means he's a criminal.
- lsn't he a Jew?

586
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,275
Some faggot murderer
represents the law round here.

587
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,438
This is a concentration camp,
not a sanatorium.

588
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,593
Come on, come on!

589
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,633
Quickly! Line up!

590
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,036
Buck up, or we'll miss coffee.

591
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,117
Line up outside!
Next!

592
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,798
Higher!

593
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,434
Put it near the cauldron.
Can't you see?

594
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,755
Higher! Come on!

595
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,557
How many times have I told you
to hold your tin nearer.

596
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,435
Next!

597
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,273
Here you are.
Next! Quickly!

598
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,475
- I see, we've gotta unload it.
- lnto four piles.

599
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,238
As they wish.

600
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,400
Ask Herr what's-his-name if we
can take off our coats and shirts.

601
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,513
Seems like a decent prick.

602
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,633
Want a caftan and fur hat?

603
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,994
Let's show 'em what the
lads from Budapest are made of!

604
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,318
- We're from the country.
- Same thing.

605
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,348
A good wash is vital.
In snow, ice, always.

606
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,152
Then you won't get scabby.

607
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,476
Always have a mouthful
of bread in your pocket.

608
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,080
Where from?
The previous day's ration.

609
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,680
Course it's not enough,
so ration it.

610
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,269
At breakfast, and don't

611
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,039
A mouthful, no more,

612
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,595
For your self esteem, get it?
Know what self-esteem is?

613
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,110
It's as important as bread and soup.

614
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,991
Want to go home?

615
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,838
Want to walk the streets
of Budapest again?

616
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,111
Without self-esteem it won't work.

617
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,116
Look!

618
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,918
Look... The Smoker!

619
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,076
Where?

620
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,314
Still smoking.

621
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,277
No good, keen Hungarian.

622
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,153
Why not save strength?

623
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,839
Shoveling for these?

624
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,078
You're Jews too after all.

625
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,715
Wash your dick too,
that's where the lice live.

626
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,389
Come on and get dry!

627
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,956
That certain hour
between returning from the factory

628
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,150
and the night-time call.

629
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,078
A particular hour,
bustling and liberated,

630
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:08,910
which I waited for and loved
the most in the camp.

631
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,316
Incidentally,
it was also supper time.

632
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,750
Hello, is that you?

633
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,268
Who else's here
from the brick works?

634
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,312
- Which block are you in?
- Here, in five.

635
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,638
Pity. I'm in six.

636
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,478
We got scattered.

637
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,115
We're all scattered.

638
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,311
Know what this "U" stands for?

639
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,476
Course. Ungarn. Hungarian.

640
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,833
You're wrong. Unschuldig.
Innocent.

641
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,400
Innocent.

642
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,431
No, pal, we'll divide it up
after the soup.

643
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,869
I won't let you gobble
tomorrow's ration.

644
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,071
But we'll never be cowards...

645
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,872
You always sing that.

646
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,911
That was our song in the Ukraine.

647
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,714
And if a comrade falls,

648
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,991
We'll send a message home

649
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,636
That come what may
We'll always be loyal

650
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,275
To our dear homeland

651
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,151
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

652
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,875
It always reminds me of
that gendarme I told you about.

653
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,198
Who said we too were Hungarians
after all.

654
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,231
And so we are.

655
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,751
I'll soon walk down
Nefelejcs Street again.

656
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:55,313
I won't start till you get in line.
Come on, line up! Rabble!

657
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:02,350
He was the most sought-after
lawyer at home. It's beyond me...

658
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,119
Carrot soup.

659
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:13,312
I like it best too.

660
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,069
Quite thick.

661
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:23,315
Look! A whole chunk of meat!

662
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:57,072
This is when the street-lights
of Budapest come on.

663
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,317
Remember
the Schmoll shoe-polish ad?

664
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:03,318
Schmoll... what?

665
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:08,110
A lit-up plane circled over
the Oktogon every evening.

666
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,869
It's gone long ago,
cos of the black-out.

667
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,469
You always say silly things.

668
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,718
The black-out will end soon.

669
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:26,515
This is when girls
set out on their dates.

670
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,348
High-heels tapping.

671
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:41,036
I'll walk down
Nefelejcs Street again...

672
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,594
Nefelejcs Street...

673
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:50,159
Not a great goal, but who cares?
It's a goal.

674
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,158
A street, or a woman,

675
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:58,797
a library...
Iong winter afternoons...
