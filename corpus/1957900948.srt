I want to thank you
all for another wonderful year

27
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,147
at <i>Genuine Article.</i>

28
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,758
I couldn't ask
for a better team.

29
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,109
And as we head
into the holiday season,

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,111
I'd like to take
a moment to reflect

31
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,461
on what's truly important.

32
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:56,028
Cue the champagne.

33
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,513
So, let's raise a glass.

34
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:08,605
To residuals, the gift that
keeps on giving all year long.

35
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:11,957
Cue the mailboxes, Katrina.

36
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:17,311
To mailbox money!

37
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,748
Now let's get
this party started.

38
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,664
And cue the music.

39
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:27,015
Look at us winning.
This party's a hit.

40
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:30,366
Well, your smile certainly
lit up the entire room.

41
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,673
But, I mean, why else
do you think I hired you.

42
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:35,371
I thought it was my mother's
well-connected business friends.

43
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,330
Or it was your
amazing work ethic

44
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:39,201
and your Ivy League education.

45
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:42,987
Hey, everything I've learned
thus far, I've learned from you.

46
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:46,557
- So, thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

47
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:52,083
Aww! Two turtle doves.

48
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:53,346
That's sweet. Thank you.

49
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,609
They're not just
any turtle doves,

50
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,438
they're turtle love doves.
They bring good luck in love.

51
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,224
Oh! So what are you implying,
I need better luck and love?

52
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:05,053
No. It would
just be nice to see you

53
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:06,446
give it a try for once is all.

54
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,448
Okay.

55
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:09,928
Thank you.

56
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,192
Incoming. 9 o'clock.

57
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,325
Ashley,
I cannot thank you enough

58
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:18,371
for putting all this together
so quickly.

59
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:21,504
- Everything is perfection.
- I'm glad to hear it.

60
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:24,638
And the holiday bonuses
in the mini mailboxes?

61
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,466
You're sheer genius.

62
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:30,818
- I do what I can.
- And all this food is beyond.

63
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,733
Are they all
Liam's personal recipes?

64
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,256
Uh, his and his mom's.

65
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,650
She has this amazing restaurant
in Nashville...

66
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,042
What's his story anyway?

67
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,001
Are he and your assistant
a thing or what?

68
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,481
Oh, no. Definitely not.

69
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:44,266
I tried. He said that
she can't be contained.

70
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:47,313
Oh, okay. So what about
you and him then?

71
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:49,445
Oh, me and Liam?
Oh, wow. No.

72
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:52,492
I mean, yes, we make
a great team in business,

73
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,145
but we are just friends.

74
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,582
I don't think about him
like that.

75
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,498
I only use him for his
"I hate crostini."

76
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,369
Oh.

77
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,112
Well, I suppose you won't mind
if we somehow find ourselves

78
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,505
under the mistletoe tonight.

79
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:08,290
Oh, no.
Go get him.

80
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,291
Hmm.

81
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,949
I must go and try
the desserts anyway.

82
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,299
Candy cane truffles look
absolutely divine.

83
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,129
- Those are always a hit.
- Ooh.

84
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:24,915
What was that all about?

85
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,875
I think Deborah
might have a crush.

86
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,311
But what do you expect

87
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,270
when you make your famous
candy cane truffles?

88
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,709
Hmm. She certainly looks,
uh, thrilled.

89
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,667
Hmm.

90
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,540
Well, everybody does.
Turned out great.

91
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,239
Old parties
by Ashley strikes again.

92
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,633
Oh, your little
catering thing helped.

93
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:49,375
Oh? Well, that's why
I do it, you know,

94
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,551
for your unbridled praise
and gratitude.

95
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,814
<i>Ashley, we need help.</i>

96
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:57,078
- Okay. Mm-hmm. Be right there.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

97
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,125
So, apparently, there's been
a poi incident in the kitchen,

98
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,040
which one of us goes?

99
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,694
Sounds awful.

100
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,698
- You go.
- Oh. Well, fine.

101
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,616
Looks like you have plans
already anyways.

102
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:17,664
Uh, suddenly, I'm very free,
actually, so...

103
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,666
Cheers.

104
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,364
To another job well done and...

105
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,845
to our third year
in business together.

106
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,151
Has it really been three years?

107
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:28,805
- Wow, doesn't feel like it.
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,590
I know, time flies.

109
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:33,811
Got to admit,
pretty excited for a break.

110
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,726
You don't know
how to take a break.

111
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,554
You're probably gonna be
blowin' up my phone

112
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:41,383
with a New Year's gig for us
to throw together last minute.

113
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:44,125
Or maybe Kwanzaa.
That's only two weeks away.

114
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:46,127
Oh, yeah, sure.

115
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,260
So, uh, when're you headin'
home?

116
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,132
Supposed to be mid next week.

117
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,742
Are you sure
you don't wanna come?

118
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,396
You know how much
my parents love you.

119
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,094
I mean, that does sound amazing.

120
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,096
Oh, your dad's bad jokes.

121
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,576
Ooh, competitive baking
with your mother.

122
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:03,753
Ah, well, she does make
a better pound cake.

123
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:06,016
Hm. That's true.

124
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:08,802
And as much as I'd love
to try my hand at that again,

125
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:11,326
I already said that I'd water
your plants while you're away,

126
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,329
and since I'm a man of my word,
I must decline.

127
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,157
Hmm.

128
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:18,899
Okay, if that's what you want.

129
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,381
I just don't like the idea of
you spending the holidays alone.

130
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,991
Trust me,
if I didn't want to be alone,

131
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:27,124
I'd be spending the holidays
in Hawaii with my mom, dad,

132
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,388
and annoying sister,
but why would I do that

133
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,651
when I have my very own luau
right here.

134
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,915
Okay, fine, plus, I forgot
about my plants anyways,

135
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,612
so, yes, please stay.

136
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:39,223
And we'll have, uh, New Year's
again in two weeks

137
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,486
like we always do, yeah?

138
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:42,357
- Yeah.
- Whether it's over a gig or...

139
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:44,359
Ooh, a super expensive bottle
of champs

140
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,622
left over from this party.

141
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,408
Let me go pull the van around.

142
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,932
Oh, okay, yeah. I'll just keep
an eye on things here.

143
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,325
Oh. So helpful.

144
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,284
- Hm. You're welcome.
- Thank you.

145
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,155
- Hey, let me just...
- Oh, yeah, thank you.

146
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,462
Thank you.

147
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,643
Okay.

148
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:09,820
Yes. Cute.

149
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,443
Oh.

150
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:28,447
That looks like the Lodge.

151
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,624
But he never goes home
for the holidays.

152
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:32,929
Does he?

153
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,584
All right, let's do this.

154
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,805
Wow!
Why do you look so guilty?

155
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,546
I'm not guilty. What?

156
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:43,636
- I don't look guilty.
- Huh.

157
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:46,116
You were stalking Grant again,
weren't you?

158
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,162
No, I wasn't.

159
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:49,946
Mm-hmm.

160
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:52,471
He liked my photo first, okay?

161
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,561
I know, it's sad!

162
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,737
I'm sad.

163
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,695
Yeah, it's not sad.

164
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,742
Creepy maybe, but not sad.

165
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:05,353
You know, my sister
always says, "It's only creepy

166
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:09,401
if they're not cute,"
and you are, so...

167
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,752
Ash, you guys were
high school sweethearts.

168
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:15,276
If you really think that
there's still something there,

169
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:18,061
then why don't you stop being
such a weirdo and talk to him?

170
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:21,151
And say what? I haven't seen him
since high school,

171
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:23,850
and we do talk... kind of.

172
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,329
You communicate exclusively

173
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,635
through comments
on social media.

174
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,637
That's not talking,
that's distancing.

175
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:31,640
Well, it's not
a perfect relationship.

176
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,990
But I just can't reach out
to him anyways, I mean,

177
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,905
he lives in New York now
and I don't even have

178
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,428
his real number anymore.

179
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,692
You know, I don't even know
why I bother.

180
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,476
You always have
some silly excuse.

181
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,304
Can't I just have my crush?

182
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:46,002
You can,
if that makes you happy.

183
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,526
It does.

184
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,223
Then why do you complain
so much?

185
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,617
- Do I?
- Mm-hmm.

186
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,270
- Yeah.
- I-I complain a lot?

187
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,968
Oh, all the time.

188
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,318
Hm. Okay.

189
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:00,626
Didn't realize. Sorry.

190
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,498
Oh. Whoa! Got to be
faster than that, creeper.

191
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:06,240
Yeah?

192
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,287
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

193
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,781
Hm.

194
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,481
Maybe he's come home.

195
00:09:57,466 --> 00:10:01,512
- Hey there!
- Oh, my! Oh!

196
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,906
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
We have to document this.

197
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,778
I hardly ever get
to wear earmuffs.

198
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,606
- Okay.
- Oh, my goodness.

199
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,129
I mean, I saw the photos,
you know,

200
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,132
but this place is not
that busted up at all!

201
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,438
Well, you know, I've been
remodeling it for months now.

202
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,092
You don't think I would go
through all that trouble

203
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,528
then build some dump.

204
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,444
No, no, no, no, baby.
No, no, of course not.

205
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:23,360
- Not on purpose.
- What?

206
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:26,494
All I'm saying is that
you and I have

207
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,801
very different definitions
of rustic.

208
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:31,194
- How was your flight?
- Uneventful.

209
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:34,110
As was that terrible drive
from LA.

210
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,026
And dark. Harmony doesn't have
much of a nightlife, does it?

211
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,811
Hey, it's not Manhattan.

212
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:42,031
Nightlife usually ends
at 9:00 p.m., not 9:00 a.m.

213
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,380
- Oh.
- But it's nice.

214
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,948
Yeah, I mean,
I could, I could do...

215
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:49,386
quiet for a couple of weeks.

216
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,867
So, um, is there
a bellhop or something?

217
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,695
Well, for now,
you're lookin' at him.

218
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,698
- Oh, rr-r-r! Such service.
- Yes, ma'am.

219
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,700
All right, so, um, be a dear

220
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,660
and please take my luggage
to my room.

221
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,879
And I hope you got me a room

222
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,925
with a sunny view
of the snowscape?

223
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,492
Uh, it has a snowed since...
It's quaint.

224
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,885
You're gonna love it.
You're gonna love it.

225
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,539
- Quaint, okay.
- Okay, I got it. Let's go.

226
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,323
Thanks. My driver brought it up.
Should be light.

227
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:15,238
- Okay.
- It's fine, it's fine.

228
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,980
Is this all just shoes?

229
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:33,561
Now where did I put...

230
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,042
my tablet?

231
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,488
- Mornin', sunshine.
- Morning.

232
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:48,794
You left your tote in the van

233
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,752
by the leftover Hawaiian ham
last night.

234
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,190
- Classic Ashley.
- Is there any other?

235
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,541
I knew you'd be lost
without your tablet and me.

236
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,935
True story.

237
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:03,025
- Whoa, you've already packed?
- Yeah.

238
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:05,114
I thought you weren't leaving
till next week.

239
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,595
Yeah. Well, plans changed,
I'm leaving today.

240
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,684
Um, why is that?

241
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:13,688
Um, I don't know.
I just don't have any more work,

242
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,298
so I figured, why not?

243
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,865
Well, then, I, uh...

244
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,172
I guess I'm glad
I brought you this.

245
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,043
Aww.

246
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,959
But we never exchange ornaments
until Christmas Eve's eve.

247
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,440
I know, but I knew that
we weren't going to

248
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,224
be able to exchange gifts
this year since you're gonna

249
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:31,488
stay home through Christmas,
so I brought it with me

250
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,273
so that you can take it with you
when you go.

251
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,405
Well, same to you.

252
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,234
It's that one right there.

253
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:45,895
You didn't think you were gonna
catch me unprepared, did ya?

254
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,769
I wonder how many of these
ornaments are from me.

255
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,989
Oh. Well,
that would be exactly 32.

256
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,122
Twenty-eight for each
and every holiday event

257
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,688
we've done together,
and then the four

258
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,125
that you've just given me
for Christmas.

259
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,475
Wow, I am super generous.

260
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,260
And only 28 ornaments
ahead of you.

261
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:08,134
Man, they've really added up
over the last four years, huh?

262
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,701
This one is still
my favorite, though.

263
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:13,400
Ah, yes,
well, it's not every day

264
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:17,752
that you get to throw a sweet 16
for an old Chinese Crested.

265
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:22,888
- That's true.
- As for me... this one.

266
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,846
- That one's your favorite?
- Yeah.

267
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,544
The big birthday party
with the petting zoo?

268
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,851
- Yeah.
- You were mauled by a goose.

269
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:34,247
I know, but despite it
being a complete disaster,

270
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,945
it was the first job
that we ever did together.

271
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:40,340
And the smoked goose that you
served at the second event,

272
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:41,907
that was a nice touch.

273
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,039
That's when I knew
we'd be a good team.

274
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,043
Uh, well, I should probably
let you finish packing.

275
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,523
Okay.

276
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,873
Thanks. I'm glad that
I got to see you before I left.

277
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,832
Me, too. Make sure
you tell your family

278
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,398
Merry Christmas for me, yeah?

279
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,574
Yeah, will do. And if you change
your mind about coming...

280
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,228
- I'll make sure to call.
- Okay.

281
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,969
- Merry Christmas, Ash.
- Merry Christmas.

282
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,189
- I'll see you for New Year's?
- Yeah.

283
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,278
Okay.

284
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,541
Don't kill my plants.

285
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,849
- I'll try not to.
- Okay.

286
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,836
There she is!

287
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,882
- Hi, sweetheart!
- Hi, mom.

288
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,101
- Oh, I'm so happy you're home.
- Oh, thank you.

289
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:48,582
- Hi. Gwen. Hi.
- Hey, little sis.

290
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,107
Oh, you look so grown-up in
your fancy rags, I, I love it.

291
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,979
I think that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

292
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,155
Don't get used to it.
You're still a little bug

293
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,983
as far as I'm concerned.

294
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,941
- Hi, Martin.
- How are you?

295
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,638
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

296
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,075
Hope my sister's
treating you well.

297
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:05,816
Well, when I'm on
my best behavior, yeah.

298
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:09,168
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Uh, where's dad?

299
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,952
He's at home, untangling
the Christmas lights.

300
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,259
He's gonna meet us
at the tree lot.

301
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,652
What? It's less than two weeks
till Christmas,

302
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,916
and you're just now hanging
the lights and getting a tree?

303
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,918
Excuse me,
we were waiting for you.

304
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,745
I mean, it is
a special occasion with you

305
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,399
coming home for Christmas
so early.

306
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,315
And it's a well-known fact that
you are a far better decorator

307
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,056
than the rest of us.

308
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:29,275
Uh...

309
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,930
Okay, so,
why are you here so early?

310
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,585
Not that I blame you, because
why anyone would spend Christmas

311
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,761
in the city is beyond me.

312
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:41,591
I don't know. I just,
I needed to come, I guess.

313
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,028
Plus, it's nice to be home.

314
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:45,987
Aww, we're so happy to have you,
little Ladybug.

315
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,729
It's gonna be a very
good Christmas. I can feel it.

316
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,383
Yeah. Me, too.

317
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,472
So, tell us everything about LA.

318
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:53,864
Oh, everything's great.

319
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,562
We just had this
big agency gig last night

320
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,433
and it was a ton of fun,
big success.

321
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,348
So, yeah, it's good.

322
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,002
And Liam, how is he?

323
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,439
Liam, he's-he's fine.

324
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,051
He certainly is.

325
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,095
Oh, God, honey.

326
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,575
Oh!

327
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:11,621
Honey, I'll get some club soda,
it'll come right off.

328
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:14,059
Um, jeez.

329
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,975
- Oh, no.
- Your sweater.

330
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,760
- Ooh, I love that smell.
- Me, too.

331
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:21,849
Vinny, Pearl? Good to see you.

332
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,937
- Oh, my!
- Hi.

333
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,504
Is this Ashley all grown up?

334
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:27,159
- Yes. Thank you.
- Welcome home. Merry Christmas.

335
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,334
Merry Christmas.

336
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,075
Let's go now
before your ma catches us.

337
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:33,382
Vinny, excuse us, we have
a tree to sort out. Yeah?

338
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:36,995
I'm telling you,
the difference is incredible.

339
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,780
We're no longer a Monterrey
pine family.

340
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:44,393
From here on out, it's only
Scotch pines for the Seevers.

341
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,960
You're really movin' up
in the world. Huh, dad?

342
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:48,223
I think so, I think so.

343
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,051
But I need your help
in convincing

344
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,358
the rest of the family
to spend some extra cash

345
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,577
because they're still
stuck in the past.

346
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,318
Uh, well, I'll do my best.

347
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,755
I know you will, honey.
I know you will.

348
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:00,757
Should we look in here?

349
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,238
Uh-huh.

350
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,937
This one's small,
but I like her shape.

351
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:08,983
Hey, Winston? Come look!

352
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,419
You see what I'm sayin'?

353
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,204
I gotta diffuse this
before it gets out of hand.

354
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:16,077
You pick our perfect
Scotch pine.

355
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,687
Okay.

356
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,994
This Monterey pine is a bargain.

357
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:24,129
That tree,
I-it's got naked spots

358
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,047
all over its northern expanse,
honey.

359
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,831
All right, thanks, Cliff.

360
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:33,052
I'll, uh, meet you back
at my truck.

361
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,233
Hello?

362
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,409
Wait, who is back there?

363
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,846
Wait...

364
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,414
Ashley?

365
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,112
Grant, hi... Wow!

366
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,942
It's so good to see you.
What's it been, like, ten years?

367
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,031
Oh, my... Uh, must be.

368
00:17:57,032 --> 00:18:00,208
Yeah, hey.
It's really good to see you.

369
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,124
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doin' in the trees?

370
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,128
Oh, that. I was just getting
a closer look.

371
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,999
I'm a real stickler

372
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,524
when it comes to finding
that perfect Scotch pine.

373
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:15,267
You know, uh...
Yep! Hey, just like I thought,

374
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:18,531
no, uh, squirrels,
so we'll take her.

375
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,489
Box it up, please. Thanks.

376
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,404
Uh, you have a little somethin'
on your...

377
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,059
Oh, I-it's designer.

378
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,715
But, um, what are you
doing home for Christmas?

379
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,760
I thought your parents moved to
San Antonio last year.

380
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,240
- Uh, they did.
- Yeah.

381
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,024
Yeah, but I'm actually
not gonna see 'em this year.

382
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,374
- Which is a major bummer.
- Hmm.

383
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,768
But, uh... No, I,
uh, moved back recently.

384
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,727
You moved back to Harmony?

385
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,295
Yeah, I did.
I know, crazy, right?

386
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:45,688
Yeah. I mean,
you're so close to LA now.

387
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,342
- I am. Yeah.
- Yeah.

388
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:49,605
Uh, anyway, I should, uh,
probably go pay for my tree.

389
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:52,304
Oh, yeah, I should probably go
find my family.

390
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:55,916
Yeah, so, uh, you know,
I really wanna catch up, though.

391
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:59,006
Are you, like, free tonight
for dinner?

392
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:02,009
Yes! I mean, I think so.

393
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,142
Probably, I... If I have
something, I could just

394
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,318
move some things around.
No biggie.

395
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,363
Okay. Well, great.
I have so much to tell you.

396
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:11,410
You know, I feel like
I've been living in our past.

397
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:12,412
Really?

398
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,631
Wow, I mean...

399
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:18,156
Yeah, something about being
back here I think

400
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,722
makes me feel that way, too.

401
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,159
Okay. Well, that's great.

402
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,552
Um, uh, yeah,
so can I pick you up at the...

403
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,337
Where are you staying?
Pick you up, like, 7:00?

404
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,861
Yeah, sure, cool.
I'm at my parents' house.

405
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,558
Same place. Do you remember?

406
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,081
I do. Of course.

407
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,433
Okay. Um, well,
I will see you then.

408
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,478
See you then.

409
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,481
Looking forward to it,
um, Ladybug.

410
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:41,876
You too, Mr. Hines.

411
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,883
I mean, can you
believe it? It's a date, right?

412
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,059
He is picking you up for dinner?

413
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,757
- That sounds promising.
- Yeah.

414
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,106
I mean,
it's like a dream come true.

415
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,935
And he moved all the way
from across the country.

416
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,415
It's better than
a dream come true.

417
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:05,333
Liam, this is
a Christmas miracle.

418
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,682
<i>I'm happy for ya, Ash.</i>

419
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,555
- Thank you.
- I hope it is a date.

420
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:12,253
But maybe, uh,
temper your expectations

421
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,822
on the off chance that he just
wants to catch up as friends.

422
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,998
Liam, I really need you to be

423
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,565
the wind beneath my wings
right now.

424
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,697
I mean, he even remembered
my nickname.

425
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:24,961
Only my closest loved ones
call me "Ladybug,"

426
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,312
and he remembered.

427
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,922
Uh, okay, fine.

428
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:32,360
It is most definitely a date
and he's probably gonna show up

429
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,449
in a horse-drawn carriage
or something.

430
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,365
<i>Thank you.
That's exactly what I needed.</i>

431
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,194
So, how's home?
Are my plants still alive?

432
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:42,283
Um, you know,
it's only been a day,

433
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,199
but somehow I've managed
to kill them all.

434
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,245
Even the succulents.

435
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,942
<i>Oh, it's fine,
it's not as exciting</i>

436
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,900
<i>as your romantic rendezvous,
however, which you should</i>

437
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:53,207
<i>definitely be prepping for
instead of talking to me.</i>

438
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,861
You're so right.
I was just being polite.

439
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,123
Anyways, I gotta go.

440
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,517
Okay. Go have fun.

441
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:00,083
And let me know how it goes,
all right?

442
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:01,824
Okay.
I'll tell you everything after.

443
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,827
Thanks, Lee. Bye.

444
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,571
Come on, dad. It looks great.

445
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,878
I mean, nobody can tell
the difference.

446
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,315
- I certainly can't.
- Well, I can.

447
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,317
Oh, honey.

448
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,580
Oh, come on now.
I tell you what.

449
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:22,541
I promise, next year, we will
spring for a Scotch pine.

450
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,282
I'll even let you
get it flocked.

451
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,327
- Okay.
- It's not what you think.

452
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,198
- Oh.
- I'll get it.

453
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,678
I'll get it.

454
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,333
Whoa, someone threw on
a designer dress

455
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,336
- and smells like...
- winter spice?

456
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,469
Honey, I thought we were
decorating the tree tonight.

457
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,341
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, mom.
I actually made plans.

458
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,952
- Can we do it tomorrow?
- Well, I suppose so.

459
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:46,521
But, what plans? With who?

460
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:50,395
Well, I don't wanna jinx it
and he's waiting outside,

461
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:55,138
but I will give you every
single detail later. I promise.

462
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,010
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

463
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,534
Love you, honey.

464
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,276
Wow.

465
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,364
- Hi.
- Hi.

466
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,672
- You look great. Uh-huh.
- Oh, thank you. Um...

467
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,978
Y-you do, too.

468
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:12,242
- Thank you.
- Um, shall we?

469
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:14,244
- Yeah.
- Okay.

470
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:16,377
So, what now?

471
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,641
- What...
- We spy from the window. Duh!

472
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:25,255
- Is that Grant Hines?
- It looks like it.

473
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:28,389
Oh, my goodness.
It's like prom all over again.

474
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,436
Only now he drives a better car.

475
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:32,438
Hmm.

476
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,105
Okay, don't peek.

477
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,194
All right.
You're gonna love this.

478
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,196
All right... Ready?

479
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:55,242
All right. Open.

480
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,549
Oh, it's the Lodge.

481
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,812
- I missed this place.
- Right?

482
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,901
I've been doin' some work on it.

483
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:04,469
- You wanna see?
- Yeah.

484
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,340
Come.

485
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,994
Wow!

486
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:11,084
You have really
spruced this place up.

487
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:14,609
I mean, the flowers
and the candles...

488
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,395
Yeah, it'll be for all
the weddings and anniversaries,

489
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,354
and romantic retreats
this place'll bring.

490
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,704
Yeah, it's very romantic.

491
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,707
- Here, come sit.
- Okay.

492
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,798
- Oh! Thank you.
- Yeah.

493
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:40,983
So, I mean, how've you been?

494
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,420
I mean, from what I see online,

495
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,509
yeah, you've been, like,
killing it.

496
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,075
Thank you.

497
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,469
Oh, yeah. I wish someone had
told me how hard it would be

498
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,081
to start my own business from
nearly nothing, but it's good.

499
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,736
I mean, okay, success aside,

500
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:57,523
how are things going
according to the life plan?

501
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,394
Don't tell me you forgot.

502
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:03,484
In school,
you had a list of things

503
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,747
that you wanted to accomplish
by the time you were 30.

504
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:08,228
- Oh, my gosh! Yeah.
- Yeah.

505
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:09,577
I can't believe
you remember that.

506
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:11,536
I have not thought about that
in so long.

507
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,494
Of course,
and it was exhaustive.

508
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,236
I mean, you had to start
your own business,

509
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:19,326
have a Lex SUV,
a mansion in the Valley.

510
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,981
Married, three kids...

511
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:24,505
Two dogs and a... Oh.

512
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,508
And... Wait, it was a closet
with a...

513
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,815
- Shoe station.
- Yeah, a shoe station.

514
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:31,512
Yup. Yeah.

515
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,514
So tell me, how are we doing?

516
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:37,170
Ah, well, um, cute house
in the Valley, check.

517
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:41,435
No husband, no dogs, but I do
have a special spot for shoes.

518
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:43,219
Wait, so you're telling me
no one has locked up

519
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,004
all this fabulousness yet?

520
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:48,964
Hm. Okay, well, clearly there's
a lot of foolish guys in LA.

521
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:53,316
Um, so, earlier you mentioned

522
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,753
wanting to tell me something?

523
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,756
Yeah,
I'm-I'm reopening the Lodge.

524
00:24:57,757 --> 00:25:00,323
- That was it.
- Oh!

525
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:01,716
Cool. Yay!

526
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,762
Yeah, after five years
of it being shut down,

527
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:07,243
we're gonna have
a grand opening in the new year.

528
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:09,811
Great, awesome.
That's...

529
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:13,815
I, I'm really glad that I can be
here to celebrate that with you.

530
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:15,165
Yeah, me too.

531
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:17,645
Yeah.

532
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:21,606
Yeah, I-I know that
we have a lotta history...

533
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,957
and I'm just, I'm really glad
that you reached out

534
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,567
over social media to,

535
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,482
you know, so we can stay,
sort of, friends.

536
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:30,919
And I know how much
this place means to you.

537
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,444
And we have a lotta
good memories here

538
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:37,056
and maybe tonight
we could make some more.

539
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,449
I'd love that.

540
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,581
So would we.

541
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,497
- We?
- Dinner's ready!

542
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:46,109
Ashley!

543
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:49,808
Come here, Ladybug!

544
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:51,157
Come, come, come,
come, come, come!

545
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,767
Oh!

546
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:56,162
- Oh! Oh! Oh, thank you.
- Mwah! You're so beautiful!

547
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:57,467
Oh!

548
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,819
Ashley, this is,
this is Bella Vega.

549
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,996
Hi! When Grant told me
that I'd get to meet you,

550
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,998
I got so excited.

551
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:08,653
You're the only person on
the planet that knows about us.

552
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:11,525
Because of work, we had to keep
everything private.

553
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:14,876
- You know what I mean?
- Okay.

554
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,313
- Anyway, you guys ready to eat?
- Yes.

555
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,707
Um, it's only Thai food.
I hope you like Thai.

556
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,275
It's the only thing that's
open in a ten-mile radius.

557
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,624
This looks amazing, Bella.
Thank you.

558
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,713
- You promise?
- Yes. Okay, should we eat?

559
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,585
Um...

560
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:32,067
I actually, uh,
don't think that I can.

561
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,592
- Wait, a-are you okay?
- She doesn't look so good.

562
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,377
No, yeah. Um, uh,
I think I've g...

563
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:39,901
I think I've gotta go. Sorry.

564
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:43,688
Uh, sorry. It was lovely,
a lovely, lovely night.

565
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:47,430
Um, so... Oops!
So great to meet you, Bella.

566
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:49,171
Can we at least give you a ride?

567
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,695
No, no-no.
No? Uh...

568
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,871
I'll, I'm gonna call a car,
it's fine.

569
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:55,352
Thank you.
Sorry, thank you.

570
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:00,705
They must think I'm crazy.

571
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,924
<i>You're not crazy.</i>

572
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:05,318
I bought him
an edible arrangement

573
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,015
from his favorite bakery

574
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:10,018
in anticipation of
our rekindled romance.

575
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,455
Okay. You're a little crazy.

576
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,980
But, that's still cute.

577
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,112
So, you said he has
a girlfriend now, yeah?

578
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:21,682
Yeah, a super sweet,
super nice, super famous one.

579
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,424
Have you seen how many followers
Bella Vega has?

580
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:26,382
I mean,
they pay her to be pretty

581
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:27,601
and to promote pretty things.

582
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,168
It's literally her job.

583
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:31,170
So, wait a minute, what about
all those flirty messages

584
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,998
that you and Grant were sendin'
each other all this time?

585
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:36,958
Well, apparently, they were just
platonic winky face emojis.

586
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:40,179
Ashley, listen, I know
you may feel bad right now,

587
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,008
but this is gonna pass.

588
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:44,705
And, honestly,
Grant can't be that great

589
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,012
if he's gonna choose her
over you.

590
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:50,885
She may be amazing online,
but you're amazin' everywhere.

591
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,888
- <i>All the time.</i>
- Thanks, Lee.

592
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:58,414
You always know exactly what
to say to make me feel better.

593
00:27:58,415 --> 00:27:59,894
I wish you were here.

594
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,288
<i>Hey, you say the word,
I'm there.</i>

595
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,683
Well, whatever that word is, yes.

596
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:09,077
<i>I guess I should turn in,
though.</i>

597
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:10,601
Thanks for talking.

598
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:15,868
- Night, Lee.
- Yeah, uh, night, Ash.

599
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,068
Coming! Coming! Coming!

600
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:45,724
Coming!

601
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,817
- Hey!
- Hi!

602
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:54,732
- Morning, sleepy head.
- Good morning.

603
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,995
Hey, um, sorry it's so early.

604
00:28:56,996 --> 00:29:00,520
Um, we just, we wanted to check
on you after last night.

605
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,130
Yeah, we were so worried,
we felt badly

606
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:04,219
and we just wanted to pop by
and see how you're doing.

607
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,004
Yeah, fine. Totally good.

608
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:08,180
Sorry about that.
Yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,182
I mean, do you have any idea
what made you so sick?

610
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:13,446
Yeah, uh, um, it was...

611
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:14,795
altitude poisoning.

612
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,928
Oh, yeah.
Altitude poisoning.

613
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,365
- Uh-huh, you know.
- Yeah. I've heard of that, yeah.

614
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,846
Yeah, I think my body just
needed some time to readjust,

615
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,586
you know, the elevation and...

616
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:25,414
Okay, well, we, um, wanted
to see how you're doing,

617
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:27,460
and I brought some
freshly-squeezed juice.

618
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:30,158
Some tonic to just flush that
altitude poisoning right out.

619
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,769
Wow! Thank you.

620
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,947
That's actually... That's very
sweet of you. Thank you.

621
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:41,082
But you guys should go.
Yeah, I'm...

622
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,041
Uh, let me grab my coat.

623
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:46,218
I just don't wanna
get you sick, you know?

624
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,742
We don't wanna inf-infect you.

625
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,439
From, uh, altitude poisoning?

626
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,963
Well, you know,
you can't be too safe.

627
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,094
Oh, yeah.

628
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:55,227
But thank you so much
for stopping by.

629
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,619
- Okay.
- So much.

630
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,491
- I really appreciate it.
- Hi.

631
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:01,059
Did one of you order the Happy
Holiday basket of baked goods?

632
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,887
No. I don't think so. I think
you have the wrong address.

633
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,497
But thank you very much.
Have a great day.

634
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,846
- You sure?
- Yes.

635
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,501
The address matches
for a "Ashley Seever?"

636
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:09,502
That's you!

637
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:10,808
Description reads,

638
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,374
"Thanks for the perfect date,
Mr... "

639
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,854
Oh, hi! How are you?

640
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,943
Yes. I f...
Sorry, I totally forgot.

641
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,989
- Um, do you want me to...
- Please.

642
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,556
Thanks. Okay, bye.
Have a great day.

643
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:23,864
I had a date yesterday
before I came over.

644
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:27,172
And I totally...
Yeah, so good.

645
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:29,870
So that's why you were
dressed up like that last night.

646
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,176
- Yeah.
- That's totally why.

647
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,699
It-it looks like it went great.

648
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,310
- Mm...
- Um... who's the lucky fella?

649
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:37,139
Um...

650
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,881
- Uh, hi.
- Hey.

651
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,927
- Liam?
- Oh, hello, everybody!

652
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,580
- Hi!
- This weather.

653
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:46,452
Ashley, look who I ran into
in town.

654
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:47,670
Yeah.

655
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:49,585
Um... Liam.

656
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,370
Um, guys,

657
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:56,028
meet my boyfriend Liam.

658
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,595
- Your boyfriend?
- You sneaky guy!

659
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:00,901
- We had no idea.
- Yeah.

660
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,903
Oh, and... this is for you,

661
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:05,471
my wonderful,
wonderful boyfriend.

662
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,648
- Wow! Yum!
- Yeah. Uh-huh. Yum.

663
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:11,259
I just wanted to come up
and spend Christmas

664
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,913
with you guys, so... surprise!

665
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:16,047
Well, we're so glad you're here!
Welcome, welcome!

666
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,919
- Yeah.
- He's handsome!

667
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,790
Uh-uh... I, uh...
Liam, I'm Grant.

668
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:24,185
I... um, I went to school
with, uh, Ashley.

669
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:25,926
Uh, you... Thanks.

670
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,320
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Yes. Yeah.

671
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:31,323
Well, I'm Bella Vega. It's
very nice to meet you, Liam.

672
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:32,498
- Ooh!
- You too, I...

673
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:33,716
You're cute.

674
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:36,502
Well, this has been great.

675
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:38,591
Thank you so much
for stopping by.

676
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,114
- Appreciate it.
- Uh, sorry.

677
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:41,942
Please, drink that tonic.
It'll flush it right out.

678
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:43,422
- I will. Yes.
- Okay?

679
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:44,858
Here you go.
Good to see you.

680
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,773
Honey, take that around.

681
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,862
- Bye.
- Bye. See ya.

682
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,995
- Okay.
- Bye now.

683
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:52,910
So, what is going on here?

684
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,173
Um, I would love to tell you
all about it,

685
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:57,871
but first, I think I need
to talk to my boyfriend.

686
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,960
- Right, babe?
- Right, babe.

687
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,049
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

688
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,050
Hm.

689
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:05,139
I've always liked him for her.

690
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,054
- Let's have breakfast. Shall we?
- Hm...

691
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:09,622
Oh, my gosh!
We're dating now?

692
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:10,797
Yeah, I don't know.
I panicked.

693
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:11,972
I mean, he asked
about the basket

694
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,452
and I couldn't tell him
it was for him.

695
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:16,237
That would've sent me down
a whole shame spiral.

696
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:19,197
And then it's like you
magically appeared

697
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:21,199
and saved the day.

698
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,375
So, why did you
magically appear?

699
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:26,291
Well, I knew that you felt bad

700
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:29,337
and, you know, after I talked
last night, I felt awful, and,

701
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:32,253
and you said, whatever the word
is, you were sayin' it,

702
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:36,605
so I drove up
first thing this morning.

703
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:38,085
It's actually really nice.

704
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:40,000
Um, who's watching my plants, though?

705
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,306
Oh, Katrina's taking care
of them.

706
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:42,394
- Okay.
- Wait.

707
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:43,569
Now will you focus, please?

708
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,920
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

709
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,009
Thank you.

710
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,837
- Focusing.
- All right.

711
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:53,274
- So, we've lied to Grant...
- Uh-huh.

712
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:55,929
His girlfriend
and your entire family

713
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,626
about bein'
in a fake relationship.

714
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:58,801
- Yeah.
- Wait.

715
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:00,020
What are we supposed to do now?

716
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,544
Well, I don't know, but I would

717
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:03,850
rather have altitude poisoning

718
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:05,330
than explain this to Grant. So...

719
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:08,028
Hm. Well, maybe we can fake
a breakup.

720
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,290
No! That's too suspicious.

721
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,770
And, plus, I don't wanna
spend Christmas

722
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,815
being fake sad
about a fake breakup.

723
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:15,209
Mm, yeah, and your family
is kind of hosting me

724
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,906
for the holiday,
so that'd be sort of awkward.

725
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:19,387
- Right.
- Maybe I could just leave again.

726
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,867
No, I don't want you to leave.

727
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:23,565
I like having you here.

728
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:26,264
Which, I guess, leaves us

729
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:30,094
with only one option.

730
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:32,661
- You want us to keep pretending?
- Just through Christmas.

731
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:34,576
All we have to do is spend
a bunch of time together,

732
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,448
which we already do,
and sprinkle in some hugs

733
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:39,320
and some hand holdings,
and when we get back to LA,

734
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,235
we can stop pretending,
and in another few months

735
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,759
I'll just call 'em and I'll
be, like, "Oh, hey, we broke up.

736
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,065
Sorry."

737
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,024
You know how crazy
this all sounds, right?

738
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,462
I know. But did you see my mom's
face when I blurted it out?

739
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:52,246
She was so excited.

740
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,248
Trust me,
this is the right thing.

741
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,163
Okay. Fine.

742
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,426
I will be your fake boyfriend
for Christmas.

743
00:33:58,427 --> 00:33:59,949
Really?

744
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,082
Yeah, sure, I mean, I already
know all things Ash,

745
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,997
so how hard could it be, really?

746
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,607
Maybe a little harder
than you think.

747
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:08,567
Bella already invited us
to go ice skating tonight.

748
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:11,049
Okay. I mean,
that's pretty casual, right?

749
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:14,660
It's couples' night on the ice.

750
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,183
Okay. Perfect.

751
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,620
Um, I guess we better put on
a good show then, huh?

752
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,580
Yeah.

753
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:37,596
- I forgot how good you were.
- Hey, guys.

754
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:38,771
- You did?
- I did.

755
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,948
Well, here, let me remind you.

756
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:46,561
- Ooh!
- Guys? Guys, guys, guys?

757
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:48,128
- Oh!
- Aah!

758
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,695
We need to take a breather

759
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:51,262
in-in case I break something.

760
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:54,569
- So... Whoa! Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

761
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,310
Spicy eggnog malts on <i>me!</i>

762
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,182
Okay. Do you, uh,
do you want some help?

763
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:00,097
- No. No, I'm good.
- You sure?

764
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,273
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you sit.
No, no, skate, skate.

765
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,057
- Yeah, I'll go. I'll go.
- Go skate. Aah!

766
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:07,147
You can't carry them all
on your own anyways.

767
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:09,410
I'll be back. You boys behave.

768
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:11,413
Okay, come on. Easy.

769
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:14,329
Whoa!

770
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Okay.

771
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:22,076
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

772
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:25,339
Mm!

773
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,472
This is so good!

774
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:29,038
How many calories
do you think are in...

775
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,650
Don't ask. Just drink.

776
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,960
He's really great
on the ice, huh?

777
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:41,399
Yeah.
Yeah.

778
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,229
Can I, uh, can I ask
for your opinion on something?

779
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,231
Yeah.

780
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:51,366
So, uh...

781
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,194
you and Ashley, huh?

782
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,371
How long has that been going on?

783
00:35:57,546 --> 00:35:59,156
Oh, uh...

784
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,071
it's, uh, pretty fresh.

785
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,682
I mean, we've been working
together for years,

786
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:05,945
but, uh... it honestly feels

787
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:08,208
like we've just started
this relationship.

788
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:12,386
Ashley always had a way
of keeping things fresh.

789
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:13,258
Oh, that's right.

790
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:14,910
She mentioned that you guys

791
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,129
went out in school, yeah?

792
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,217
We did.

793
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:19,001
"Mr. and Mrs. Harmony High."

794
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:22,353
- Ah.
- She was really something.

795
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:24,093
So, I know Grant and I
have only been together

796
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:25,573
for, like, three months,

797
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:28,663
but I kinda feel
like there's something off.

798
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:29,925
Does that make sense at all?

799
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,232
Off how?

800
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:35,409
Well, I feel like,
like we're not moving.

801
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,282
Like we're always toeing
the line between dating

802
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,458
and being in a relationship,
you know?

803
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,982
But you came out here
for Christmas, so...

804
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,592
Oh, yeah, right.

805
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:47,029
But, you know, and partially
that's my fault.

806
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,509
You see, my publicist, um,

807
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,468
doesn't think that being
in a relationship

808
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:51,686
is good for my brand.

809
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:55,255
And so, even the dating
has been... quiet.

810
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,517
But what am I supposed to do

811
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,432
when he just up and moves
back here?

812
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,173
Like, I literally have to force
my way

813
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:02,044
into spending Christmas
with him,

814
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:04,612
especially, since my family
lives in Tokyo.

815
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:05,831
Tokyo?

816
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,703
Yeah, that's why
I speak fluent Japanese.

817
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,967
Can I ask you a weird question?

818
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:15,971
Uh... why exactly did
you and Ashley breakup?

819
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:18,670
Well, trust me,
neither of us wanted to.

820
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:22,935
But I got accepted in Boston,
and she got accepted over in LA.

821
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:25,198
We talked about doin'
the long-distance thing,

822
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,202
but, I was just more
of a realist.

823
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:32,074
We came to a point where
it wasn't realistic anymore.

824
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,075
Anyway, I'm sorry.

825
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:34,947
I don't mean to just unload

826
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,905
all of this on to you, I just...

827
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,342
I have nobody else to talk to.

828
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:42,128
And, um, you know, you and Grant
tick pretty close.

829
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:44,478
Yeah. Honestly, anytime.

830
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:47,133
I totally understand
how you feel.

831
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:51,833
He can be frustratingly sweet
and charming.

832
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,008
And that can make it hard
to tell

833
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:54,749
where you stand with him sometimes.

834
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,185
Right. I know.

835
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:58,579
It's just, I feel
like I'm pushing too hard.

836
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,017
You know, maybe if I just,
I step back?

837
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,932
Maybe you should.

838
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,760
Yeah.

839
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:07,588
I mean, this whole party thing
was my idea.

840
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:10,635
I am literally volunteered
to spend Christmas Eve

841
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:14,291
hosting this-this big event
just to impress him.

842
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,162
Well, do you still think
it'll work?

843
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:19,296
Maybe. I don't know.

844
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,169
But what I do know is
that I am in way over my head.

845
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,736
- Oh.
- Yeah.

846
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:26,999
And all I really have
is a great guest list.

847
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And I do mean great.

848
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:29,393
I mean, I have a ton

849
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:30,611
of influencer friends
who are gonna

850
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:32,352
plug this place
until it's booked up

851
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,181
at least a year in advance.

852
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:39,664
But, wrangling everything else
feels like a real rodeo.

853
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,187
- Yeah.
<i>- All right.</i>

854
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:42,710
<i>All of you holiday lovebirds,</i>

855
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:45,191
it's seven oh seven,
and you know what time that is.

856
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,801
It's time for a ho-ho-ho...

857
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:48,368
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

858
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,804
<i>So, grab that special
Mr. and Ms. Claus</i>

859
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:51,415
<i>in your life
and head to the rink.</i>

860
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:54,679
- Oh, look.
- Hi!

861
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,551
Whoa! Whoa-whoa!

862
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,862
Ladies, you heard the DJ Santa.

863
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:07,256
No, it's a hard pass for me.

864
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,997
I'm still enjoying my malt.

865
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:11,130
Yeah, I need to take a break, too.

866
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:12,523
I've nearly fallen three times,

867
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:15,004
and those guys up there
keep laughing at me.

868
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,531
But why don't you go skate
with Grant?

869
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,666
Hey-yo, Ladybug,
game if you are.

870
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:27,929
Ooh!

871
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,150
- Bye!
- Okay.

872
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,413
Okay, come on. Oh!

873
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,589
It's been a while
since we did this.

874
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:41,160
Yeah. We used to skate circles
around every other couple.

875
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:43,423
Hey, I think we still got it.

876
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,947
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

877
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,385
Come on.

878
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:51,650
Aren't they cute?

879
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:55,523
It's, uh, real cute.

880
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,699
Oh, yeah.

881
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,928
Thanks again
for inviting us tonight.

882
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,669
- That was so fun.
- Oh, of course.

883
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,410
I just, I hope that we get
to hang out again

884
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,933
before the holidays.

885
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,021
Oh, I was thinking...

886
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:17,979
I don't know if Grant told you,

887
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,677
but I'm an event planner,

888
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:22,419
so I'm sure you'll have great
plans for the Christmas party.

889
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,159
But if there's anything
that you need help with,

890
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,378
just let me know.

891
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:28,468
- Ashley, are you serious?
- Yes!

892
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:31,558
I love the Lodge. I have
so many great memories there.

893
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,473
And, plus, my job is awesome,

894
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:34,866
so it doesn't even
feel like work.

895
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:36,911
Hm, I guess that means
you're gonna be spending

896
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,435
a lot more time there, too.

897
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,516
Oh, wow, yeah, I didn't even
really think about that.

898
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:44,615
I'm so excited! Yes!
I think the more, the merrier.

899
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:46,443
Uh, if Grant's okay with it.
Are you okay?

900
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,402
Uh, yeah, sure! I mean,
I think it's a great idea.

901
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,447
Plus, we'll get
to relive all those

902
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,839
old memories like we'd hoped.

903
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,406
Only, now, we'll go
make some them all new.

904
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,190
So, it's settled.
We'll come by tomorrow

905
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:56,409
and get a jump on things.

906
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,238
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

907
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,284
Everything's...
I know, it's gonna be great!

908
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:07,159
This was supposed to be
a holiday break.

909
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,639
I just don't understand why.

910
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,510
What do you mean?

911
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,730
Grant is my friend
and this is important to him.

912
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,689
Not to mention, we literally
do this for a living.

913
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,865
Okay.

914
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:25,394
You sure that's all?

915
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,005
There is nothing else
prompting this

916
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:29,007
saccharine, sweet proposal?

917
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:32,532
Because yesterday you couldn't
wait to escape the two of them.

918
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,838
I don't know
what you're getting at,

919
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,101
but just because
you're my fake boyfriend,

920
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:38,016
it does not mean you can
be fake jealous.

921
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:41,193
I am not jealous.

922
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:43,543
- No? Okay.
- Fake or otherwise.

923
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:46,981
I just don't want you
to make a giant mistake.

924
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:49,070
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wait a minute.

925
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,072
You're not actually thinking
that you still have a chance

926
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:53,422
with him now that you know
he's taken, right?

927
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,033
Kind of taken.

928
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:58,427
Bella said it herself.
They're very loosey-goosey.

929
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:00,908
Plus, you saw how he was
with me tonight.

930
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,910
Clearly, there's still
something there.

931
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,259
Wow! Um...

932
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,261
You are really wrapped up

933
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:08,002
in all this nostalgia,
aren't you?

934
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:10,396
Spirit of the season.

935
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:12,659
Holiday romance. Plus, I mean,
around every corner.

936
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,443
Wow, you're really making this

937
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,445
into something it's not,
aren't you?

938
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:19,274
And it's not any of
your concern.

939
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:21,189
Okay. If you say so.

940
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,451
Just don't come runnin' to me

941
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:23,888
when this all blows up
in your face.

942
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:26,325
Oh, I won't, because
the only thing blowing up

943
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:29,197
will be my phone
after we send out the invites.

944
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:31,199
- Hm. Great.
- Great. Good.

945
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,158
- Fine.
- Fine.

946
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,683
Wait, wait, can I get some
marshmallows in this?

947
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,736
Thank you. It's good.

948
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:49,043
- Cheers!
- Yay! Holiday party!

949
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:52,351
I cannot thank you guys enough

950
00:42:52,352 --> 00:42:54,266
for helping me with this.

951
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:56,137
Oh, of course.
We're happy to.

952
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,879
And I gotta say, this place
is pretty spectacular.

953
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,534
Oh, my gosh, you should've seen
the Lodge in its prime.

954
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:04,842
I mean, this place
was the staple of Harmony.

955
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:06,583
When Grant and I were dating,
we threw some

956
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,672
pretty amazing parties here.

957
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:09,803
We sure did.

958
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:11,413
I mean, especially
at Christmas time,

959
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:13,459
sometimes I felt like
the entire town was here.

960
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,157
- Oh.
- I think they were.

961
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:18,203
Um, anyways, I was up all night

962
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:20,684
thinking of ideas for the party,
but I don't wanna step

963
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,642
on anyone's toes,
so why don't we start

964
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:23,991
with you guys telling me
what you think

965
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:25,950
needs the most help
and we'll go from there.

966
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,648
Honestly, it's probably
a good question for her,

967
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:29,910
because she's been
handling the party

968
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,346
and I've been making sure everything

969
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:32,739
is in order
for the real opening.

970
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,654
You, I'll-I'll...
Okay.

971
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:35,830
Um...

972
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:40,399
Well... Um...
It's not a lot.

973
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,661
You know, it's, um,
we just, we're just

974
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,620
tying up some loose ends,
so we're...

975
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,665
Okay. Um, like what?

976
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,537
- Yeah, like... Hm?
- Like what?

977
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:50,975
I told you.
I told you about the guest list.

978
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:53,151
We have the guest list.
It's a great guest list.

979
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:55,501
- Perfect.
- Beautiful. Yeah.

980
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:58,025
- And what else?
- And then, we have the venue.

981
00:43:58,026 --> 00:43:59,679
The venue is...

982
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,420
- Oh, it's great. Yeah.
- Yeah.

983
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:05,425
So, no decorations or...

984
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:11,169
- That's it.
- Oh.

985
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,997
Okay.

986
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:17,479
Well, I mean, this is
like a big, grand opening

987
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,133
Christmas Eve shindig, right?

988
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:21,005
So, we probably want more

989
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:23,660
than just your average
household items, right?

990
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,011
I mean, we need to be thinking
bigger here, right?

991
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:28,447
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

992
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:29,753
- Absolutely.
- What about food?

993
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:31,711
- Yeah.
- Do, do you have a caterer?

994
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:34,105
No. No, we have the restaurant.

995
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:36,411
So, the restaurant
will handle it. So...

996
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:38,936
With, uh, less than
a week's notice?

997
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:40,677
This is their busiest time
of year.

998
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,636
Eight days.
It's not a week.

999
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:46,030
- Well...
- Yeah.

1000
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:48,423
Luckily, we have Liam,

1001
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:51,426
who is a rock star.

1002
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,646
- Fantastic.
- Okay.

1003
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:55,735
Great.
So, music.

1004
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:57,955
Oh, music!
Mus... Yes!

1005
00:44:57,956 --> 00:45:00,740
My, um... Okay.

1006
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:03,656
My CrossFit playlist
is literally the jam. Yeah?

1007
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:05,614
So, I was thinking we just plug
that into the speakers

1008
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,921
and just let it, like,
rock the space.

1009
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:10,316
It'll fill in beautifully.

1010
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:15,015
- And that could be awesome.
- Mm-hm.

1011
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:18,932
Um, or maybe we could
ask the local DJ Vinnie,

1012
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:22,327
the guy who played at
the ice rink, in the Santa suit.

1013
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,329
I mean, don't be fooled
by the hat.

1014
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,940
He can really turn it out for
a party. I think he'd be great.

1015
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:29,073
I think that's a, that's a,
that's a great idea.

1016
00:45:29,074 --> 00:45:30,770
I think that's a great idea.

1017
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:32,685
- I think it's great.
- I think it's great.

1018
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:34,078
- Okay. Um...
- Great.

1019
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,994
And then we can do holiday
Christmas beverages.

1020
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:39,170
We'll need tables, chairs,
place settings...

1021
00:45:39,171 --> 00:45:40,693
Maybe we can just take these

1022
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:41,825
tables and move them
to the gray room.

1023
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:43,478
- Love it. Okay.
- Yeah? Cool.

1024
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:47,004
Okay, well, I think that-that's
pretty much it for now, right...

1025
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:48,483
Oh, of course. Theme.

1026
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:49,963
I mean, I'm sure you guys
at least have

1027
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:51,399
a theme already, right?

1028
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,011
Yeah, it's Christmas.

1029
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:55,665
Christmas is the theme.

1030
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,584
That's fine!
Okay, we'll figure it out.

1031
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:06,023
We have worked
with a lot less before.

1032
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:08,895
- It'll be fine, so...
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1033
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:13,639
We have a lot of work to do,
so who wants to go shopping?

1034
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,251
- I do. Shop.
- Perfect.

Cheers.

1054
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:28,932
- Oh.
- Mm.

1055
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:31,064
We still have a lot of work
to do, but we really

1056
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:32,761
whipped this place
into shape today.

1057
00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:34,589
This place is amazing.

1058
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,287
Ashley, thank you so much.

1059
00:47:36,288 --> 00:47:38,767
I don't know what would've
happened if she didn't help me.

1060
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:42,467
Ah. And... we now have
our theme.

1061
00:47:42,468 --> 00:47:43,903
"Home for the holidays."

1062
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:46,688
That feels good, doesn't it?

1063
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,081
It really does.

1064
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:49,691
Reminds me so much
of how my parents

1065
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:50,954
decorated it for the holidays.

1066
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:53,304
That's exactly
what I was going for.

1067
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:55,610
I remember when your parents
had me over for Christmas,

1068
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:58,439
and it just felt
so warm and magical

1069
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,660
and it just felt like home.

1070
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,535
Uh, well, then...

1071
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,189
I think I'm gonna
start cleanin' up.

1072
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,799
Gotta get back to your parents.

1073
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,975
Ah, Liam, let me help you
with that.

1074
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,933
Oh, no, it's fine.
I got it.

1075
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:16,501
No. No, no, no, no.
It's okay. I will help you.

1076
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:19,025
You're such a dear.

1077
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:21,202
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1078
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:28,253
The place looks really great, Ashley.

1079
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,037
It brings back a lotta memories.

1080
00:48:31,038 --> 00:48:33,649
A lot of really good ones, too.

1081
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:37,435
You know, I wish it was spring

1082
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:40,438
because I would love to throw
a party over in that garden.

1083
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:41,918
That was always
my favorite place here.

1084
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,921
Oh, mine too.

1085
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,837
Do you remember over here...

1086
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:53,669
You know...

1087
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:57,542
right there is where you and I...

1088
00:48:57,543 --> 00:49:00,762
Our first kiss.
Right before prom.

1089
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:02,547
That is not the kind of night
that you forget,

1090
00:49:02,548 --> 00:49:05,029
even in our old age.

1091
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,074
It's weird, you know?

1092
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:11,730
I know we haven't seen
each other in years, but...

1093
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:14,428
seeing you back here just

1094
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:16,300
makes me feel, like...

1095
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:19,607
I don't know, just, like,
not a day has gone by,

1096
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:21,174
especially the more
that I see you.

1097
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:26,049
Yeah. I mean, this place is like
a time capsule to the past.

1098
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,313
To a place where it kinda feels
like we never really left.

1099
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:32,664
Yeah, well, we certainly really
never stayed and say goodbye.

1100
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:34,318
Oh, well, that's because
I didn't know

1101
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,147
we were gonna have one of those.

1102
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:38,366
All right.

1103
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,587
Yeah, I-I, um...

1104
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:44,894
I don't know,
it just sorta happened.

1105
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:47,635
I'm sorry for the way
things turned out.

1106
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:49,986
Oh, don't be.
That's life.

1107
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,206
Plus, we both turned out okay,
didn't we?

1108
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:55,339
Did we though?

1109
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,038
I know, lately, being back here
just makes me...

1110
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,346
I don't know. I'm not so sure.

1111
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:07,133
Hey, Grant, can you
come here, please?

1112
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:10,703
- I should...
- Yeah. Go ahead.

1113
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:17,491
Mm...

1114
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:21,321
You have been unusually smiley
the past half hour.

1115
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:24,063
Did something happen
that I should know about?

1116
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:25,152
No.

1117
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,763
Okay, but you can't tell anyone.

1118
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:32,941
Grant and I had a moment.

1119
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:34,552
- A moment?
- Uh-huh.

1120
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:36,032
Uh, what does that mean?

1121
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,381
I don't know.

1122
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:42,430
There was just a spark
and it was perfect.

1123
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:46,216
- Um, Ash?
- Mm.

1124
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:47,652
You know I care about you, right?

1125
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:49,175
I know what you're going to say.

1126
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:52,004
It's not just my imagination.
He felt it, too.

1127
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:54,137
Okay, then what about Bella?

1128
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:56,356
Oh. Well, she's more friend
than girlfriend,

1129
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:58,010
and they live
in two different states,

1130
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:00,665
and she has no intention
of moving out of New York.

1131
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:03,320
And you have no intention
of leaving LA. So what?

1132
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,017
But that's less than
three hours away.

1133
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,584
We could make that work
for a while.

1134
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:08,368
Ash...

1135
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:12,155
what if this is just
residual sparks, huh?

1136
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:15,419
I mean, how much do you have in
common with him anymore anyway?

1137
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,552
You've been back in his life,
uh, what, a few days

1138
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:21,468
and all of that you know about
him is from his social media.

1139
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:22,861
Okay. Look.

1140
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:25,429
I know you are just
looking out for me,

1141
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,170
and I appreciate that,

1142
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:31,043
but please just be happy
for me, once.

1143
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:32,479
You're the one who's always
telling me,

1144
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,394
"Don't work so much"
and, "Go out on more dates."

1145
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:38,051
That's what I'm doing. I'm just
giving something a chance.

1146
00:51:39,313 --> 00:51:42,924
All right. Fine.
I just don't wanna see you hurt.

1147
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:44,361
Well, thank you,

1148
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:48,016
but I know everything
is gonna turn out perfect.

1149
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:50,062
I can just feel it.

1150
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:52,108
- They're here.
- Good evening, family.

1151
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,718
Well, somebody's in a good mood.

1152
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:56,503
Did you buy her something
special for Christmas or what?

1153
00:51:56,504 --> 00:51:57,765
Nope.

1154
00:51:57,766 --> 00:51:59,593
There's just so much magic
in the air

1155
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:02,944
and joy and peace and love

1156
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:04,120
and all that good stuff.

1157
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,904
Can't you feel it?

1158
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:07,732
Hot buttered rum
from Frittella's, am I right?

1159
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:09,429
- All right.
- Yeah...

1160
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,866
Not an ounce of alcohol
running through her veins, so...

1161
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,303
I'm just happy to be home.

1162
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:16,654
And what a Christmas
it has already been.

1163
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:18,177
Okay. We've been waiting
two days.

1164
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:19,961
Jackets off.
Let's decorate this tree.

1165
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:21,006
Fine.

1166
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:23,313
As the baby of the family,

1167
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:25,184
it's usually my job
to put the star on the top,

1168
00:52:25,185 --> 00:52:27,012
but I'll let you do it.

1169
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:28,448
Oh, thank you.

1170
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:31,190
What a kind and considerate
girlfriend you are.

1171
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:32,496
I know.

1172
00:52:32,497 --> 00:52:34,106
Liam, Ashley tells me
that you like ornaments

1173
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:36,587
even more than she does,
which I find hard to believe.

1174
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:39,677
I actually do. I mean,
they all tell a story, right?

1175
00:52:39,678 --> 00:52:42,419
Oh, reel it in, ornament nerd.

1176
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,247
Let's start with these,
shall we?

1177
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:47,119
You seem giddy. I take it
things are going well with Liam.

1178
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,208
That's definitely it.

1179
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:51,993
Your mom and I always knew
you'd end up together.

1180
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:54,953
- Okay, dad.
- That's true! It's true!

1181
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:57,434
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Thank you.

1182
00:52:57,435 --> 00:52:58,652
Um, wait a minute.

1183
00:52:58,653 --> 00:53:00,480
This guy has to have a story.

1184
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:03,570
Oh, that's a Christmas story
for the ages.

1185
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:07,095
Have you ever been fishing
in Cancun at Christmas time?

1186
00:53:07,096 --> 00:53:09,272
- Hm.
- Oh, yeah, we have.

1187
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,751
So, what do you think,
front and center, or?

1188
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:12,579
- Yeah. That's good.
- All right.

1189
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,887
Here we go. Um...

1190
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:28,247
Well, looks like we get to do it

1191
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,031
together this year
after all, huh?

1192
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:33,252
You brought them!
Thank you.

1193
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:34,298
May I?

1194
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:39,258
The poi incident.

1195
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:40,347
Uh...

1196
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:44,132
I love it.

1197
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,830
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1198
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:47,397
Your turn.

1199
00:53:47,398 --> 00:53:50,574
You always get me ornaments
that remind me of our memories,

1200
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:53,142
so I thought I had to do
the same for you.

1201
00:54:02,151 --> 00:54:05,023
- Oh, my gosh, you remember that?
- Mm-hmm.

1202
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:06,851
- Oh!
- A good one.

1203
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:08,070
Yeah.

1204
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:10,899
- The banana...
- Banana...

1205
00:54:13,902 --> 00:54:16,034
- It's perfect.
- Mm.

1206
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:18,080
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1207
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:24,085
Well, what are you waiting for?

1208
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:26,437
Are you gonna kiss
or hang 'em up?

1209
00:54:28,482 --> 00:54:30,178
- Uh...
- Yeah.

1210
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:32,006
- Let's see, what do you, what...
- Here?

1211
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:33,791
- I think that's perfect.
- Okay.

1212
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:35,880
What about, um, here?

1213
00:54:35,881 --> 00:54:38,404
Yes. Perfect.

1214
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:40,493
- I think it looks pretty good.
- Hmm.

1215
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:42,016
It really does.

1216
00:54:42,017 --> 00:54:44,236
- Thank you for helping.
- Kidding me?

1217
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:46,717
I love your family.

1218
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,109
It's been great.

1219
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,415
Oh, all except for the part

1220
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,112
where your dad got really mad

1221
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:54,551
'cause his fish ornament
was too heavy for the branches.

1222
00:54:54,552 --> 00:54:57,945
Anyway, I know I kinda crashed
your family Christmas,

1223
00:54:57,946 --> 00:55:01,384
but... thank you for having me.

1224
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,994
I had a really good time,

1225
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:05,866
you know, despite the whole
"we're dating" thing.

1226
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:08,826
Right. Yes.
But it was great.

1227
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:10,567
And I'm sorry
that we haven't been able

1228
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:13,352
to spend some more
one-on-one time together lately,

1229
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:17,966
but it was nice hanging out,
just us tonight, a little bit.

1230
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,100
Having you here makes it feel

1231
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:24,146
like my whole family's together.

1232
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,368
- Oh, goodness.
- Oh, God.

1233
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,936
I think that's our cue
to turn in.

1234
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:34,068
- Goodnight, everybody.
- Goodnight.

1235
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:35,896
Yeah, goodnight.

1236
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:38,682
Yeah. I'm pretty tired, too.

1237
00:55:38,683 --> 00:55:40,684
Oh, yeah. M-me, too.

1238
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,903
Uh, see ya in the morning?

1239
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:45,253
Yeah. Bright and early.

1240
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:48,082
Early. Right.
Goodnight, Ash.

1241
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,563
Goodnight, Lee.

1242
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,642
You are...

1243
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:27,295
Hey, guys!

1244
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:28,775
- Hey!
- Hey!

1245
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:30,343
- Hi!
- Hi!

1246
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,127
We were actually
just out shopping

1247
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:34,520
for the Christmas party.

1248
00:56:34,521 --> 00:56:36,783
Oh, yeah? Uh, did you guys
find anything good?

1249
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:39,438
Yeah, actually, we started off
at the grocery store

1250
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:41,353
and stalked upon
all the supplies that we need,

1251
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:45,096
because Liam is making his
famous turkey and dumplings,

1252
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:49,187
and his stellar pumpkin cakes
with butter cream cheese icing.

1253
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:50,318
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

1254
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,059
That sounds amazing. Liam.

1255
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,584
And then we picked up a bunch
of goodies from the gift shop

1256
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:56,847
so that we can make swag bags
for all the guests

1257
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:58,501
in which I will then label

1258
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:01,025
"Especially delivered
by Santa himself."

1259
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:02,809
I love the idea!

1260
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,159
Oh, m-me too, Ash.
I mean, I love it.

1261
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,900
Thank you.
Um...

1262
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:09,033
Uh, do you guys want to join us?

1263
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:09,991
I mean, we haven't even
ordered yet.

1264
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:11,252
No, no, no, that's okay.

1265
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:12,471
No, no, no, please!
Please, Liam!

1266
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:14,168
Please, Ashley, please, sit!

1267
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:17,128
- Yeah, okay. It'll be fun.
- Sure.

1268
00:57:17,129 --> 00:57:18,347
Perfect.

1269
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:22,612
This food is really great.

1270
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:24,396
I gotta say I'm impressed
with old Harmony.

1271
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:25,441
- Yeah.
- Mm. Yeah.

1272
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,442
I mean, Ash and I would

1273
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,660
come here when we were kids.

1274
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:28,705
It was our fav.

1275
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:30,707
That's great.

1276
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:33,492
Ash and I actually have a spot
like this back home, too.

1277
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,276
We basically moved
into the Gwendal

1278
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:36,321
the last year, didn't we?

1279
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:38,279
Mm-hmm.
Uh, it's so good.

1280
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,717
And they have this
slightly-charred sourdough

1281
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:42,675
that they bring out for first,
and it is the best bread...

1282
00:57:42,676 --> 00:57:45,112
The best bread
you'll ever butter.

1283
00:57:45,113 --> 00:57:47,854
Hey!

1284
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:50,727
You said that the first time
we went there four years ago,

1285
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:52,990
and I'll never forget it
'cause it's totally true.

1286
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:54,600
Oh!

1287
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:57,516
Okay, everyone. This next one
is a personal favorite of mine,

1288
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:59,344
so I wanna see all of you
out here

1289
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:01,172
on the dance floor, you hear me?

1290
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:04,349
Let's get into
that holiday spirit.

1291
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,525
What do you think, guys?
Shall we?

1292
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,048
Don't tell me you can't dance.

1293
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:09,833
Oh, on the contrary,

1294
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,791
I was born a dance TV OG.

1295
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:14,838
- Shall we?
- Are we really gonna do this?

1296
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:16,710

1329

He's dancing with Bella.

01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,121
<i>♪ Your smile is like
an angel singin'... ♪</i>

1360
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:40,260
Oh, Liam.
These all look so good.

1361
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:41,785
One second.

1362
01:01:43,047 --> 01:01:44,090
- Ooh.
<i>- Voila.</i>

1363
01:01:44,091 --> 01:01:46,745
- Ah. These look amazing.
- All right.

1364
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,138
Are you ready to give 'em a try?

1365
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:49,530
Oh, yeah. Cheers.

1366
01:01:49,531 --> 01:01:51,055
- Cheers.
- Bing.

1367
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:53,927
- Whoo.
- Mm.

1368
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:57,103
- Mmm.
- Mm.

1369
01:01:57,104 --> 01:01:58,409
Mm.

1370
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,715
Oh, wow.

1371
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,805
Grant, what do you think?

1372
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:05,503
Yeah. No, looks,
uh, looks pretty good.

1373
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:07,635
Mm, no. It's wonderful.

1374
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:09,333
You're just jelly
'cause you can't even bake

1375
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:13,119
ready-made pizza without burning
the edges on every side.

1376
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,819
Sorry, Grant, I think that means
it's three to one

1377
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,473
and all of these make the cut.

1378
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:20,518
Yeah.

1379
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:24,652
Which means, our menu is done.

1380
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:27,177
Hm, these Christmas Santa
stocking stuffers

1381
01:02:27,178 --> 01:02:29,266
are such a cute idea.

1382
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:30,310
I love it.

1383
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:31,703
Yeah.

1384
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:33,313
These beauty supplies
are gonna be a treat.

1385
01:02:33,314 --> 01:02:35,925
Your guests will wanna keep
coming back for too.

1386
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:37,101
Nice.

1387
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:41,191
Liam, nice work.

1388
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:44,108
You keep that up
and we'll be done in no time.

1389
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:51,854
Oh, my baby bear,
it's not a race. Okay?

1390
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:53,160
It's okay.

1391
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:59,426
So, this will be
our buffet station,

1392
01:02:59,427 --> 01:03:01,602
and with the chairs out,

1393
01:03:01,603 --> 01:03:04,344
it will force people to mingle
as they jingle.

1394
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:06,477
- Ooh.
- Wow. Uh, ho.

1395
01:03:06,478 --> 01:03:08,567
Nice work, Grant.

1396
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:13,615
Oh.

1397
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:15,835
It's okay.

1398
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:19,665
It's cute.

1399
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:27,499
All right, I think
this is the last one.

1400
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:30,675
Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe your parents

1401
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:32,068
kept all these for so long.

1402
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:35,375
Right! These are perfect
for the party.

1403
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:36,812
Vintage like the Lodge.

1404
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,596
Yeah, well,
they're the same ones

1405
01:03:38,597 --> 01:03:40,033
they used
when they first opened.

1406
01:03:42,253 --> 01:03:44,603
I'm gonna take some of
the empties down to the cellar.

1407
01:03:45,343 --> 01:03:46,735
I'll help.

1408
01:03:51,175 --> 01:03:52,219
Hm.

1409
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,814
What are you doing?

1410
01:04:22,815 --> 01:04:25,077
Go ahead.
I'll just be a few minutes.

1411
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:27,253
Are you sure?
It's freezing out here.

1412
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:28,559
Yeah. I'm fine.

1413
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,082
I'm still a mountain girl
at heart.

1414
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,868
Plus, I got my boots.

1415
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,782
All right, Ladybug.

1416
01:04:34,783 --> 01:04:36,960
Don't let your wings
freeze shut.

1417
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,678
Looks nice, doesn't it?

1418
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:03,203
Even more beautiful
than I remembered.

1419
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:09,687
Ash, I'm not imagining this,
am I?

1420
01:05:09,688 --> 01:05:11,428
Imagining what?

1421
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:14,866
I don't know.
I mean, maybe...

1422
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:18,609
Maybe it's just us
both being back here...

1423
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:22,700
or maybe it's me
seeing you with someone else

1424
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:25,659
for the first time
in, like, forever, but...

1425
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,009
- No.
- I kind of feel, it's...

1426
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,402
I know what you mean,
and I felt it, too.

1427
01:05:29,403 --> 01:05:31,274
You do?

1428
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:33,103
I knew you did.

1429
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:38,150
You know, look,
I know our lives went

1430
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:42,546
in different directions when
we were younger, Ash, but...

1431
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:44,375
I mean, it brought us back here.

1432
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:47,290
And I don't know
what that means,

1433
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:51,468
but... I know
how it makes me feel.

1434
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:53,645
Liam calls me Ash.

1435
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:57,735
Grant, it's my fault.

1436
01:05:57,736 --> 01:05:59,911
I'm the one that's making you
feel this way.

1437
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:04,307
I was hoping to see you
when I got here.

1438
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:06,265
I was hoping to run into you

1439
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:09,399
and I was hoping
that you'd be single.

1440
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,924
But then, I met Bella,
and she's so sweet,

1441
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:14,926
and she's wonderful and...

1442
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:17,015
- But you love Liam.
- No.

1443
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,539
I mean, yes, of course,
I love Liam

1444
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,021
but I'm not in love with Liam.

1445
01:06:31,378 --> 01:06:32,944
I'm sorry.

1446
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:34,772
I shouldn't have done that.

1447
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:36,775
- That-that was...
- Grant?

1448
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,474
Um, Bella.
Wait, no, no, no. Bella.

1449
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:43,347
Bella, Bella! Bella!

1450
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:45,305
Bella!

1451
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:52,050
- Listen...
- I don't...

1452
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:53,791
I didn't mean
for any of that to happen.

1453
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,488
Grant, Grant, please, just stop!

1454
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:57,055
Just stop! No!

1455
01:06:57,056 --> 01:07:00,102
I saw the way you've been
looking at Ashley lately.

1456
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:02,060
You still have feelings for her

1457
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:03,975
which means, I got really bad
feelings for you.

1458
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:05,411
- Can we just talk about it?
- No!

1459
01:07:05,412 --> 01:07:07,152
If you'd just let me
explain what's on.

1460
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:09,546
No! I will not hear
anything you have to say.

1461
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:11,156
Listen, listen, just,
can you please calm down?

1462
01:07:11,157 --> 01:07:13,071
Nothing.
No, don't you dare touch me.

1463
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:14,638
I swear to God,
if you touch me...

1464
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:16,248
Bella, just... Bella...
I don't care.

1465
01:07:16,249 --> 01:07:17,815
- Listen to me.
- I'm leaving.

1466
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:19,426
- Calm down, okay? Please.
- No.

1467
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:22,341
My God, what's wrong with you?

1468
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:25,562
I just wanna talk
about this. Please? Okay...

1469
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:27,738
What's goin' on in there?

1470
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:29,261
Uh, Grant kissed me
in the garden.

1471
01:07:29,262 --> 01:07:30,915
- I know, I know, okay?
- I don't care.

1472
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:32,569
I do not care. Do not.

1473
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:33,831
Where're you gonna go?

1474
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:35,528
Y-you can't just leave
the Lodge.

1475
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:36,747
Just, please just stay.

1476
01:07:36,748 --> 01:07:39,489
You are deader than fish!

1477
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:40,968
- Bella, come on. Bella!
- No!

1478
01:07:40,969 --> 01:07:43,449
- Can you just listen to me?
- No!

1479
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:46,017
Bella, come on, can you just,
please stay here tonight

1480
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:47,845
until you have somewhere else
to stay?

1481
01:07:47,846 --> 01:07:49,020
All right, you can have
the master bedroom

1482
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:50,500
with the big closet,
it's all yours.

1483
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:52,545
You don't even have a plane
ticket till next week.

1484
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:53,894
Where are you gonna go?

1485
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:56,332
There are plenty
of bed and breakfasts out there.

1486
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:59,336
I'm gonna come back tomorrow
to pick up my coats!

1487
01:08:00,554 --> 01:08:01,685
Bella, what are you...

1488
01:08:01,686 --> 01:08:03,166
Come, just listen to me.

1489
01:08:09,694 --> 01:08:11,260
Why did you let him
do that, Ash?

1490
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:13,697
I don't know.

1491
01:08:13,698 --> 01:08:15,916
I have to stop her.

1492
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:17,396
So, you're gonna leave?
You're leaving?

1493
01:08:17,397 --> 01:08:21,574
I will hear nothing
you have to say. Nothing!

1494
01:08:21,575 --> 01:08:23,098
- Bella...
- Bella, wait.

1495
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,535
What you saw there
is on me, okay?

1496
01:08:25,536 --> 01:08:29,060
Grant never would have kissed me
if I didn't confuse him

1497
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:32,716
into being jealous
of me and Liam.

1498
01:08:32,717 --> 01:08:34,109
And I did it on purpose.

1499
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,937
I don't understand.

1500
01:08:36,938 --> 01:08:39,505
Why would you cheat on Liam?

1501
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:41,203
He's wonderful.

1502
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:43,509
And why would you try to take
Grant away from me

1503
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,469
when you know he's mine?

1504
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:49,125
I didn't cheat on Liam...

1505
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:54,347
because he's not my boyfriend.

1506
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:58,350
The truth is,
we're just friends.

1507
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:59,830
We were just pretending
to go out

1508
01:08:59,831 --> 01:09:01,005
so that I wouldn't look like
a fool

1509
01:09:01,006 --> 01:09:02,312
in front of the two of you.

1510
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:05,052
It wasn't planned. I just...

1511
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:06,489
I dug myself into a hole

1512
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:09,362
and he was sweet enough
to go along with it.

1513
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:12,148
Grant...

1514
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:14,323
I messed up.

1515
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,499
When I first got here, I thought

1516
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,370
maybe you
still had feelings for me,

1517
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:22,200
because I definitely
still had them for you.

1518
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:26,336
And then, you invited me
to dinner and...

1519
01:09:27,641 --> 01:09:29,947
I made a mistake.

1520
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:34,038
And when I realized that,
I was mortified.

1521
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:37,868
I shouldn't have let it
get so out of hand. I'm sorry.

1522
01:09:37,869 --> 01:09:39,392
No, you knew.

1523
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:42,178
You knew.

1524
01:09:44,136 --> 01:09:48,574
You set me up to get hurt

1525
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:51,621
because you thought I was some
silly social media hashtag

1526
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:53,580
without any real feelings.

1527
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,325
You two deserve each other.

1528
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:03,763
- Bella, this is...
- Grant, I'm sorry.

1529
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:06,505
Is there anything I can do?

1530
01:10:06,506 --> 01:10:08,595
Just go home, Ashley.

1531
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,207
Party's off.

1532
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:19,257
Let's go.

1533
01:10:19,258 --> 01:10:23,174
- Just get outta here.
- Liam, I can't just go.

1534
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:25,002
I have to do something.

1535
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:26,961
I really think
you've done enough.

1536
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:29,616
I'll be out by the car.

1537
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:38,581
I don't understand
why you have to leave too.

1538
01:10:38,582 --> 01:10:42,411
I know you don't.
And that's the problem.

1539
01:10:42,412 --> 01:10:44,848
If you have something
to say to me, Liam,

1540
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:46,589
just say it!

1541
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,461
Please!

1542
01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:54,119
Being here this week...

1543
01:10:55,686 --> 01:10:57,730
it's been great.

1544
01:10:57,731 --> 01:11:01,081
I've loved to getting to see
all of Harmony.

1545
01:11:01,082 --> 01:11:02,692
Being around your family
where you grew up,

1546
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:04,564
but it has also been torture.

1547
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:09,960
When I held you
on the dance floor...

1548
01:11:09,961 --> 01:11:12,224
that, that just felt right.

1549
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:15,095
Then I thought

1550
01:11:15,096 --> 01:11:17,097
maybe we could be
something more than friends,

1551
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:19,926
maybe you felt it, too, but...

1552
01:11:19,927 --> 01:11:22,451
Why didn't you just
tell me that then?

1553
01:11:22,452 --> 01:11:26,324
Because I don't wanna be
a backup plan, Ash.

1554
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:29,284
Your second choice, after Grant,
the one that got away.

1555
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,982
You're not a backup plan.

1556
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:34,681
You know you mean more to me
than that.

1557
01:11:35,769 --> 01:11:37,335
You know you do.

1558
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:39,946
I think we need some time
to cool off.

1559
01:11:39,947 --> 01:11:43,342
- I'm leaving in the morning.
- Please don't leave like this.

1560
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:47,302
Maybe when you get back to LA
after the new year,

1561
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,523
we can just pretend
that none of this ever happened.

1562
01:12:50,757 --> 01:12:53,455
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

1563
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:55,152
Nobody to blame but myself.

1564
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:57,284
Did you try talking to Grant?

1565
01:12:57,285 --> 01:12:59,243
Yeah. He won't respond.

1566
01:12:59,244 --> 01:13:01,245
I basically crushed
his whole plan

1567
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:03,813
to have a big grand opening
for the Lodge, so...

1568
01:13:03,814 --> 01:13:07,512
Seems like you need
some of my hot cocoa coffee

1569
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:10,950
and a good old-fashioned
Christmas miracle.

1570
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:12,169
Thank you.

1571
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,431
Sweetheart, there's got to be

1572
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:15,172
some way to save this party.

1573
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:16,391
It was supposed to be tonight,

1574
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,740
and it's kinda hard
to have a party

1575
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:19,785
without a host.

1576
01:13:19,786 --> 01:13:22,179
Plus, half the guest list is
just Bella's influencer friends

1577
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:25,313
who are supposed to plug
the Lodge and...

1578
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:30,231
Liam left,
so we don't have food.

1579
01:13:32,712 --> 01:13:36,193
I've never seen him look
so disappointed.

1580
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:39,196
You and Liam
will always be friends.

1581
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:41,372
He will forgive you.
I promise.

1582
01:13:41,373 --> 01:13:43,157
I think he was right though.

1583
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,423
I don't know if
I wanna just be friends anymore.

1584
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:51,427
Did you tell him that?

1585
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,820
Well, then, young lady,
I think you've got

1586
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:57,257
some more work to do
before Christmas.

1587
01:13:57,258 --> 01:13:59,565
You can't not tell him
how you feel.

1588
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:02,132
I just wish I could take
everything back

1589
01:14:02,133 --> 01:14:03,481
and make it right.

1590
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:04,917
Yeah, you'll think of something.

1591
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:06,092
If you put your mind to it,

1592
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:07,093
there is not a thing

1593
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:09,095
not one thing

1594
01:14:09,096 --> 01:14:12,490
that a Seever cannot do.

1595
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:15,101
Especially our little Ladybug.

1596
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:18,409
Well, everything I learned,
I learned from you two, so...

1597
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,759
And me.

1598
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,632
So, what happened here?
Why all the sad faces?

1599
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:25,677
The little Ladybug's home
for the holidays.

1600
01:14:25,678 --> 01:14:27,505
I need happy faces, now.

1601
01:14:27,506 --> 01:14:30,161
Come on, y'all heard her.
Smiles up!

1602
01:14:32,163 --> 01:14:34,164
"Home for the holidays."

1603
01:14:34,165 --> 01:14:36,035
That is our theme.
Oh, my gosh.

1604
01:14:36,036 --> 01:14:38,298
Home for the holidays.
I can fix this. I can fix this!

1605
01:14:38,299 --> 01:14:39,996
I can fix this.
Thanks a lot.

1606
01:14:39,997 --> 01:14:41,171
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Honey?

1607
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,695
- We'll be back.
- Gotta go.

1608
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:44,871

01:16:58,352 --> 01:16:59,876
Hey, Bella.

1657
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:05,402
Literally, do not address me
from my good side.

1658
01:17:05,403 --> 01:17:06,751
Uh, look.

1659
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:08,666
I know I'm probably
the last person

1660
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:10,015
that you wanna
talk to right now,

1661
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,582
but, please just hear me out

1662
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:13,671
before you go back to New York
and I never see you again.

1663
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:16,543
Why would I listen to anything
you have to say?

1664
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:18,110
And how did you find me anyway?

1665
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:22,855
Well, you just posted a selfie
on the town sleigh and...

1666
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:27,294
Wow. Stalker!

1667
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:32,429
Fine.

1668
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:33,996
Just get it over with.

1669
01:17:33,997 --> 01:17:37,869
Okay, well, look,
I know I screwed up.

1670
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:40,350
Me and Grant kissing,
that's on me.

1671
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,744
It wasn't just a kiss.

1672
01:17:42,745 --> 01:17:47,096
Ashley, it's clear that Grant
still has feelings for you.

1673
01:17:47,097 --> 01:17:50,403
But I don't think he does.
Maybe he thought he did.

1674
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:53,189
But it wasn't real.
It was just a fantasy.

1675
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:56,496
And I know that because
I felt the exact same way.

1676
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:58,542
Yeah?

1677
01:17:58,543 --> 01:18:00,718
Well, it still doesn't excuse
what you did.

1678
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,111
I know.

1679
01:18:02,112 --> 01:18:04,896
But I want you to know that
that was some

1680
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:07,943
insecure little schoolgirl
tryin' to steal Grant back.

1681
01:18:07,944 --> 01:18:12,470
Some silly girl that could never
compete with the Bella Vega.

1682
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:14,601
Hmph!

1683
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:17,387
And that girl
is not the real me.

1684
01:18:17,388 --> 01:18:18,736
Yeah?

1685
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:20,391
Well...

1686
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:24,089
if you were really dating Liam,

1687
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:26,963
I'd try to steal him from you
just to exact my revenge.

1688
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:29,486
That's fair.

1689
01:18:29,487 --> 01:18:31,270
Even though Grant
is totally dead to me.

1690
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:33,055
Bella...

1691
01:18:33,056 --> 01:18:35,753
I-I know Grant still cares
a lot for you.

1692
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,624
I can see it in the way
that he is with you.

1693
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:39,452
And I know him better
than anyone.

1694
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:41,280
You really think so?

1695
01:18:41,281 --> 01:18:43,848
I really, really do.

1696
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:47,939
I mean, I even considered moving
here just to be close to him.

1697
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,985
I mean, I think I kind of
already did.

1698
01:18:49,986 --> 01:18:52,683
- I just haven't told him yet.
- Oh, good.

1699
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:55,773
Don't throw away your chance
at love over one mistake

1700
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:58,907
that wasn't even
entirely his fault.

1701
01:18:58,908 --> 01:19:00,691
Trust me.

1702
01:19:00,692 --> 01:19:03,999
What I did cost me
something real with Liam.

1703
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,045
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

1704
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,836
- What's this?
- A peace offering.

1705
01:19:14,837 --> 01:19:19,014
If you still care for Grant,
at all, please consider it.

1706
01:19:19,015 --> 01:19:21,538
At least one couple
deserves to be happy.

1707
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:23,322
Anyway, the choice is yours,

1708
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:26,238
but thank you
for hearing me out.

1709
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,153
And, Bella,

1710
01:19:28,154 --> 01:19:33,332
if I never see you again,
I really am sorry.

1711
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,682
And I actually think we would
have made great friends

1712
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:37,990
if I hadn't royally screwed
everything up.

1713
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:43,474
Anyway... Merry Christmas.

1714
01:20:10,588 --> 01:20:13,068
Hey, Grant.

1715
01:20:13,069 --> 01:20:16,245
Ash, what are you doing here?

1716
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:20,641
You hired me to do a job
and I intend to see it through.

1717
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:30,607
Ashley, no one's gonna come.

1718
01:20:30,608 --> 01:20:32,174
I mean, we haven't given them
any notice.

1719
01:20:32,175 --> 01:20:33,479
They will show up.

1720
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,524
They'll remember.

1721
01:20:34,525 --> 01:20:35,612
Those people love this place

1722
01:20:35,613 --> 01:20:37,135
just as much as we always did.

1723
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:39,007
They'll come.
I know that they will.

1724
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:41,183
Look, I haven't forgiven you
for what you did.

1725
01:20:41,184 --> 01:20:42,880
And, you know,
I haven't forgiven myself.

1726
01:20:42,881 --> 01:20:45,274
You don't have to forgive me
now, or ever.

1727
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:48,190
But don't let the Lodge suffer
for my mistake.

1728
01:20:48,191 --> 01:20:49,757
Our mistake.

1729
01:20:51,063 --> 01:20:53,543
Our mistake.

1730
01:20:53,544 --> 01:20:56,111
Now you should go get ready
before people start showing up

1731
01:20:56,112 --> 01:20:59,244
because as much as I love this
mountain man bachelor look,

1732
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:01,987
it's not really appropriate
for the party.

1733
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:06,556
You're ridiculous,
little Ladybug.

1734
01:21:06,557 --> 01:21:08,601
So are you, Mr. Hines.

1735
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:09,951
Now go get ready.

1736
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:11,736
You've got a party to host.

1737
01:21:21,354 --> 01:21:22,789

This is so beautiful.

1756
01:22:18,846 --> 01:22:21,326
And you should light it
at the top.

1757
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:24,200
- Thank you. Thanks.
- And you're looking beautiful.

1758
01:22:25,723 --> 01:22:27,246
Thanks.

1759
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:30,683
- Oh. Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

1760
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:33,338
Well, it's just perfect.

1761
01:22:33,339 --> 01:22:34,600
Thank you.

1762
01:22:34,601 --> 01:22:36,907
Oh! Let me.

1763
01:22:36,908 --> 01:22:39,127
Are these Liam's truffles?

1764
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:41,216

1776
01:23:27,698 --> 01:23:30,004
Ashley, I-I...

1777
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,353
I don't know what to say.

1778
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:34,356
I mean, this is all just,
it's amazing.

1779
01:23:34,357 --> 01:23:37,489
Well, this place is amazing

1780
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,143
and everyone remembered.

1781
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:42,016
But, unfortunately,
I think it might mean

1782
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,192
you're gonna have to do this
every year.

1783
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:47,064
Well, there's definitely worse
problems to have.

1784
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:51,068
It looks like some of Bella's
influencer friends came.

1785
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:53,288
I wish she was here to see this.

1786
01:23:53,289 --> 01:23:55,943
I mean, this was
originally her idea.

1787
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:00,686
Finally getting the credit
I'm due?

1788
01:24:00,687 --> 01:24:01,905
Bella.

1789
01:24:01,906 --> 01:24:03,777
I'll let you two catch up.

1790
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,173
Wait, how did you...

1791
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:11,001
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

1792
01:24:11,002 --> 01:24:13,003
I wasn't planning on it.

1793
01:24:13,004 --> 01:24:18,269
But Ashley did pay me a visit
and she told me everything.

1794
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:22,317
And she said
that I would be stupid

1795
01:24:22,318 --> 01:24:25,668
if I let you off the hook
that easily.

1796
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:28,236
- She did?
- She did.

1797
01:24:28,237 --> 01:24:29,715
Well, I'm happy
that you're here.

1798
01:24:29,716 --> 01:24:32,327
I just, I didn't want you
to leave.

1799
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:33,719
And I was...

1800
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,765
It was just in my head,
and I was consumed with...

1801
01:24:35,766 --> 01:24:38,333
No, I know, I know, and I'm
sorry, I've been waffling abou...

1802
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:40,683
You know what,
it wasn't your fault.

1803
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:42,685
No, no.
I spoke to my publicist

1804
01:24:42,686 --> 01:24:44,295
and I told her

1805
01:24:44,296 --> 01:24:47,299
that I don't want to keep
my feelings a secret anymore.

1806
01:24:48,909 --> 01:24:52,042
But I'm telling you,
I am not moving here.

1807
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:54,479
- Okay.
- But I will stay in town.

1808
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,874
And help you until you get this
beautiful place up and running.

1809
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,442
- You will?
- Yeah.

1810
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:01,792
I will.

1811
01:25:03,446 --> 01:25:04,969
Under one condition.

1812
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,145
Okay, what's that?
Name it.

1813
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:13,585
I want you to teach me
how to ice skate

1814
01:25:13,586 --> 01:25:17,415
like you did with Ashley,
'cause it was so dreamy!

1815
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:19,809
All right. Deal.

1816
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:21,898
- Mm.
- Mm.

1817
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:23,248
- Whoo.
- Ooh.

1818
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:36,131
Cute lights.

1819
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:40,438
Eating cake on the clock.

1820
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:42,005
Hm.

1821
01:25:42,006 --> 01:25:43,877
What are you doing here?

1822
01:25:44,878 --> 01:25:48,098
Well, I almost went home...

1823
01:25:48,099 --> 01:25:50,187
until I realized
that I was driving away

1824
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:54,149
from the only person that I
wanted to spend Christmas with.

1825
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:58,153
And how did you know
I would be here?

1826
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:02,895
Interestingly enough,
Bella told me.

1827
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:04,375
Did she?

1828
01:26:04,376 --> 01:26:07,249
Texted me a picture
of the invite actually.

1829
01:26:08,598 --> 01:26:10,642
Sorry, I know that
I'm not technically invited,

1830
01:26:10,643 --> 01:26:14,646
but, hey, crashin' anyway.

1831
01:26:14,647 --> 01:26:17,693
Liam, when you tried to tell me

1832
01:26:17,694 --> 01:26:20,217
how you felt
when we were dancing...

1833
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:23,655
and probably countless
other times...

1834
01:26:23,656 --> 01:26:26,005
I just...

1835
01:26:26,006 --> 01:26:27,398
I didn't realize.

1836
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:28,922
Same.

1837
01:26:30,054 --> 01:26:31,533
I think it was always there.

1838
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:33,492
We just didn't see it.

1839
01:26:34,841 --> 01:26:37,016
Well, that's okay.

1840
01:26:37,017 --> 01:26:38,758
Because now we do.

1841
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:01,127
I have some good news.

1842
01:27:01,128 --> 01:27:02,652
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1843
01:27:04,306 --> 01:27:08,265
Most of the people in the town
still think we're together,

1844
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:12,661
so if you still wanted
to come to the party,

1845
01:27:12,662 --> 01:27:15,664
you could probably attend
as my fake boyfriend.

1846
01:27:15,665 --> 01:27:17,274
Huh.

1847
01:27:17,275 --> 01:27:19,233
- I could do that.
- Mm.

1848
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:25,065
Or I could, I don't know, maybe
come in as your real boyfriend.

1849
01:27:26,153 --> 01:27:28,155
I think that could be arranged.

1850
01:27:28,895 --> 01:27:30,375
- Yeah?
- Hm.

1851
01:27:31,855 --> 01:27:33,334
Merry Christmas, Ash.

1852
01:27:33,335 --> 01:27:34,901
