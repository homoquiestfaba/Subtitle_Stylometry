a good thing.

I'm solving world hunger.

Uh-oh. Very funny.

521

It's dangerous,
that sort of work,
okay?

522
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,834
It's not really fit
for a woman.

523

get down and let me
finish up, please?

take advantage of your
manly stacking skills.

531

Emanuel, get down.
Let me do my job.

532
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:12,889

to meet any women
back here?

533

What I'm saying is,
you're looking
very handsome these days,

535
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:21,831
and it's wasted on me.

536
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,667
Why are you being so nice?

537
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,302

538

you're here.

She's just making
me crazy today.

How come?

557
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:06,069
I don't know.
Usually, I can just
sit her in her bouncy chair

558
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,772
and she will
entertain herself.
But no, not today.

559

This is her
new best friend.

This is terrible,
but sometimes I just
don't want to be a mother.

564

I just want to push
a button and put Chloe
on pause

565

and just get on
with my day.

No. Sounds honest.

569
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,902
Do you want me
to give her a bath?

570

No, we've already
done that.

571
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,473
You know, actually,
the one thing that
would be really helpful

572
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:46,876
is if you could just honestly
tell me which of these
sweaters I need to toss.

573
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,646
Okay, but I'm not
so good with fashion.

I think it's too young for me,

but I think you
have excellent taste.

I wear to your house
on Friday?

I can't babysit
Friday night.

I met on the train.

Does he have a name?

587
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,488
Claude.

588
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,863
You should wear this.

589
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,631
Here, try it on.

worn it in ages.

I wore the first date

how to step up when
it comes to being a dad.

for this cold. So...

come and see if maybe
you had a little baby...

had a mother.

created a longing in her,

be getting home too.

and sitting
through that.

I'm glad I came.
Really?

862
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:41,870
Yeah. I mean,
everyone's family
is a little odd.

863
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:44,039
If it's not,
then it's not
really a family.

So that uncomfortable,
annoyed feeling I get

865
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,877
whenever I walk
in the house is just
telling me I'm home.

866
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,780
(LAUGHS) Yeah,
pretty much.

867
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:54,249
(SIGHS) I feel the same.

868

Same as?
Before.

It's stupid, but somehow
every year on my birthday

870
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:05,661
I have this feeling
that this year
I'll feel different.

871

What?

880
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,987
Yeah. Your dad hooked
it up. You know, because
I work at the nursery.

881
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,389
I mean, she may not hire
me, but I think I could
do a pretty good job.

want to see you all the time.

What?
I can't get on the train
without you being there

885

babysit without
you being just

I can't have kids.

1026
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:47,842
You know my
first husband, he
left me because of it.

1027
01:15:47,844 --> 01:15:52,947
And the grief
that I felt...

1028
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:57,785
It almost put me
over the edge.

1029
01:15:57,787 --> 01:16:07,895
Anyway, that's all.

1030
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:27,982
Anyway, that's all.

1031
01:16:27,984 --> 01:16:38,092
Sorry about
the other night.

1032
01:16:38,094 --> 01:17:01,882
Sorry about
the other night.

1033
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:04,752
THOMAS:  <i>Trying for</i>
<i>a baby was my idea.</i>

1034
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:09,023
Uh, I actually
thought it might fix
things between us.

1035
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:11,859
Five years and nearly

1036
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:15,863
$100,000 later, we
finally had our baby.

1037
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:19,333
By then our marriage
was all but over.

1038
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:24,205
And then, uh...

1039
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:25,873
Linda blamed herself.

1040
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:30,411
She was the, uh, she was
the one who found her.

1041
01:17:30,413 --> 01:17:37,985
Autopsy was inconclusive,
so we'll never really
know what happened.

1042
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:42,990
My wife refused to
go to the burial.
She just couldn't.

1043
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:46,227
That's when
the doll happened.

1044
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:50,765
I tried to get her committed
and she disappeared.

1045
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:54,969
So that's when I went to
the police station and filed
a missing person's report.

1046
01:17:54,971 --> 01:17:57,238
What's her prognosis?

1047
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:02,410
Doctors seem less
than optimistic.

1048
01:18:02,412 --> 01:18:05,913
I want to see her.

1049
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:09,183
You don't want
to see her.
Not, not like this.

1050
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,317
Besides, it's
not possible.

1051
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:16,691
They're only allowing family.

1052
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:20,761
You okay?
Can you get me
in to see Linda?

1053
01:18:20,763 --> 01:18:23,798
Close the door.

1054
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,400
Em, this obsession
with Linda has to stop.

1055
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,803
She's not
your mother.

1056
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:31,172
She's nothing like
your mother.
You hear me?

1057
01:18:31,174 --> 01:18:33,274
That doesn't mean
she doesn't deserve
to be saved.

1058
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:36,010
I'm sure the doctors
are doing everything
they can to help her.

1059
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:37,745
Like they
did for Mom!
Emanuel.

1060
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:39,380
Her husband is gonna
let her rot in there.

1061
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:42,049
You don't know what's
in people's hearts.
No!

1062
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,985
But I know
what's in mine.

01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:58,946
I have her.

1074
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:03,183
Is she okay?

1075
01:22:03,185 --> 01:22:06,220
No?

1076
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:12,526
Did you hurt her?

1077
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:16,597
She was already hurt.

1078
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:25,940
Well, I want
to see her.
Where is she?

What happened?

1081
01:22:43,092 --> 01:22:45,693
The tide came up.

1082
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:50,998
I was holding her hand
and it took her away.

1083
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,134
Why didn't you
hold her closer?

1084
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:57,471
I just couldn't.

1085
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:02,476
Tide was too strong.

1086
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,212
It took us to where
the water is

1087
01:23:05,214 --> 01:23:10,050
the deepest darkest blue
you've ever seen.

1088
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:15,289
And we were happy,
swimming amongst
the fishes.

1089
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:18,425
Then Chloe let
go of my hand.

1090
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:21,261
And I was scared.

1091
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:25,499
But actually,
for me, not for her.

1092
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,368
She knew exactly
what she was doing

1093
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:29,470
and where
she was going.

1094
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:33,640
I lost sight of her.

1095
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:38,445
And then the fishes
brought me back here.

1096
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:43,083
Why? Why did they
bring you back?

1097
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:45,486
For you.

1098
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:40,407
