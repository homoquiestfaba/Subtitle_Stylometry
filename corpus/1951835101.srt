1
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:38,704
<i>Mother?</i>

2
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,981
<i>What's going on? Mother?</i>

3
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,371
Judith, where is my mother?
Where is my family?

4
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:54,393
I don't know. I
haven't seen anyone.

5
00:01:56,563 --> 00:02:00,647
It's only the ninth hour, and
the day seems darker than the night.

6
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,464
Mother!

7
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:26,842
<i>We are here-</i>

8
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:29,941
To judge a woman
who is guilty of adultery...

9
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,090
<i>with a foreigner, with a Roman!</i>

10
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:37,834
<i>Who accuses this woman?</i>

11
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:41,622
I do. I.

12
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:44,093
What are you asking for your bride?

13
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:47,704
That she be punished according
to the full extent of the law!

14
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:50,962
So be it!

15
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:55,202
No! Father! Not
my mother, Father.

16
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,769
<i>Father! No!</i>

17
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:03,645
You must throw
the first stone, Nathan.

18
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:04,992
No!

19
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:15,471
I can't. I cannot.

20
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:22,932
<i>Stone her! Stone her!
- No!</i>

21
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:26,334
No. Don't. Have
pity. Have pity!

22
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,337
Stone her!

23
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:31,571
<i>No! No!</i>

24
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:35,594
Go away! Tabitha! Go away!

25
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:45,332
<i>No! No!</i>

26
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:54,297
Forward... for Rome. Hey!

27
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:18,442
The Romans! The
Romans are here.

28
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:22,399
<i>Wait. We'll
ask the priestess.</i>

29
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,900
<i>High priestess-
what does she say?</i>

30
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:44,369
It's an earthquake!

31
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:47,221
<i>Dismount! To the ground!</i>

32
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:14,560
I've got their flag!

33
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,376
The flag!

34
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:36,599
Romans! With me! With me!

35
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:41,066
<i>For Rome! For Rome!</i>

36
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:02,578
Burn the priestess.

37
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:13,127
<i>Stop!</i>

38
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:31,009
Your gods are
also destined to die.

39
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:07,983
<i>Long live the Roman Empire!</i>

40
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,248
<i>A battle has been won. But
one battle is not enough for Rome.</i>

41
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:23,185
Rome wants to
win the war...

42
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:26,602
and for this to happen,
the emperor of Rome...

43
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,991
wants your leader- Segimerus.

44
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,897
No Roman is familiar
with his appearance...

45
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:38,462
<i>but I know
he's amongst you.</i>

46
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:40,902
<i>Now, I could
crucify all of you...</i>

47
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:44,536
to be sure I kill
Segimerus with the others.

48
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:49,444
But I'm offering him
the chance to act with honor.

49
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:53,348
Segimerus! Come forward...

50
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:58,529
<i>and I will save the lives
of your companions.</i>

51
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:05,127
I am Segimerus.

52
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:09,097
Is he Segimerus?
- Yes.

53
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:11,864
He is Segimerus.

54
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:15,269
With his lust for
power and glory...

55
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:20,189
this dog had led
us to our downfall!

56
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:27,465
Stop!

57
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,620
Segimerus.

58
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,820
<i>You're finally
in the hands of Rome.</i>

59
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,571
<i>But you're to be executed
by one of your own men-</i>

60
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:47,083
<i>the one who
identified you.</i>

61
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,172
And in exchange...

62
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:55,273
he will not only
receive his life...

63
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:58,194
but also freedom.

64
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,704
Come on. What
are you waiting for?

65
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,667
You will be a free man.

66
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:24,539
Segimerus! Segimerus!

67
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:29,809
Commander, how did you
realize he was Segimerus?

68
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,813
I'm well acquainted
with these people.

69
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:34,878
They are barbarians,
but they are loyal.

70
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:39,287
Not one of the royal guardsmen
would betray his king.

71
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:41,622
Each one of them
would rather die for him...

72
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:44,457
except one- himself.

73
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:48,795
Offer the prisoners the chance
to choose between joining the legion...

74
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:51,733
or being sold as slaves.

75
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:55,333
<i>You I will keep
in my personal service.</i>

76
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:58,571
What's your name?
- Brixos.

77
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:03,061
And you'll never have my loyalty,
unless I decide to give it to you.

78
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,058
<i>Allow us to render
funeral honors to our king.</i>

79
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:12,933
In exchange, I shall
use my sword at your service.

80
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:36,077
Oh, Father Segimerus.

81
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:41,964
Oh, Father Segimerus.

82
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,055
I have a message
for Titus Valerios Taurus.

83
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:52,508
Titus Valerios Taurus.

84
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:58,098
Commander of the Seventh Gemina
Legion, at our emperor's service.

85
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:00,034
Our emperor requires your presence.

86
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:02,470
<i>You're to be given the honor
of meeting him personally.</i>

87
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,705
<i>Hand command over to your
subordinate. Gather your things.</i>

88
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,589
<i>The emperor
is expecting you.</i>

89
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:14,189
The emperor is expecting me.

90
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:37,070
Emperor Tiberius has taken up residence
on Capri for the past few years now.

91
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,751
<i>Almost everyone calls him
"the man of the island. '"</i>

92
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:52,116
<i>Why did you bring me back
after so many years of exile?</i>

93
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:56,057
<i>I have decided to entrust you
with a missión that calls for all your talent.</i>

94
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:59,292
<i>It's a mystery that
cannot be solved byjust anybody.</i>

95
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:05,233
One day, in April, at the
ninth hour, the sky clouded over.

96
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:07,269
<i>Yes, in Germania too.</i>

97
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:10,773
<i>And during the battle, the earth trembled.
- Yes.</i>

98
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:14,107
These mysterious signs were observed
in many countries of the worid...

99
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:16,111
from east to west,
from north to south.

100
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:20,712
And since then, I've had research conducted
in the entire empire...

101
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:24,816
because I wanted to know
whether there is a link...

102
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:27,952
between these
extraordinary events.

103
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,476
And I believe
I've found a clue.

104
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,106
Where?
- In the Tabularium in Rome.

105
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:39,231
The clerks in my
archives found it.

106
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,236
What is it?

107
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:46,371
It's the records from a trial
that came to a close with a death sentence.

108
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,810
There are hundreds of death
sentences every day in the empire.

109
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,813
What's so extraordinary
about this one?

110
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:54,161
It's all included
in my instructions.

111
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,998
Read them, carefully,
and then destroy them.

112
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,908
What is my destination?

113
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:09,563
Jerusalem, the
prefecture ofJudea.

114
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:12,500
Can I rely on our
local authorities there?

115
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,006
Of course. Just try to be
as independent as you can.

116
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:21,274
I understand.
- What do you know about the situation in Judea?

117
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:24,678
I know that the governor is a
man named, uh, Pontius Pilate...

118
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,083
and that the entire area
is a snake's nest- not much more.

119
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:31,932
Yes, that's-that's
about all you need to know.

120
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:37,135
I will obey your
orders, Emperor.

121
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:17,465
"Proceedings against
Jesus of Nazareth...

122
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:22,486
"the so-called king
of theJudeans...

123
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,553
by the praetorian ofJerusalem."

124
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:42,687
Welcome toJerusalem, strangers.

125
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:46,074
Do you want to
sleep with me tonight?

126
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,948
<i>They're beautiful.</i>

127
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,200
Shh, shh, shh.
Who is that stranger?

128
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,106
Come with me, my friend.
Welcome to town.

129
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:59,200
There's a quieter, more secluded
spot through that door.

130
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:01,934
The service is
better and quicker.

131
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:06,239
Did the man from
the island send you?

132
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:10,523
If the answer is yes, we can
speak more privately over there.

133
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:21,135
Bring some of your
best wine and some lamb.

134
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:28,078
First of all,
tell me what...

135
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:32,066
someone representing the emperor...

136
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,603
is doing in a
disreputable hole like this.

137
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:36,767
This is the perfect place...

138
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:39,808
to pick up interesting
bits of information...

139
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:44,352
for, uh, someone like me.

140
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:54,987
Barabbas. So,
how did it go?

141
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,892
We killed off a
lot of those dogs.

142
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:02,397
And one of them, before dying,
gave me the information I was looking for-

143
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:05,382
the identity of the traitor
who works as a spy for the Romans.

144
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:09,586
Is it him?

145
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,841
I'll take the
food to those two men.

146
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,362
Bolt the doors
from the outside.

147
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:25,587
Who are you?
- We are looking for the way.

148
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:29,321
<i>Our lord Jesus has said the day is near.
- Come.</i>

149
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:34,311
<i>We must be ready for soon he
will return and change the worid.</i>

150
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:42,969
My name is Stephen
and this is my brother David.

151
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:47,014
We welcome you here, sisters.
Is this your first visit?

152
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,334
Put it on the table.

153
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:04,368
Death to the traitor.

154
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,086
Brixos!

155
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:46,699
Friendly place.
- Very... friendly.

156
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:48,776
Let's leave now.
- Yes, master.

157
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,454
You traitor!

158
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:14,240
Oh, Barabbas! Remember
who you owe your life to.

159
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:21,745
<i>Master!</i>

160
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:25,148
Master. The Roman patrol.

161
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:30,744
You were about to tell me something.
Make an effort, my friend.

162
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:34,648
I need this last piece of information.
Your last service to the emperor.

163
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:37,619
You must find...

164
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:40,217
<i>a man who lives...</i>

165
00:22:40,316 --> 00:22:44,057
outside the gates of the city.
- Where?

166
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,156
The house belongs to a man-

167
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:50,396
Judas Iscariot.

168
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,834
<i>They call it... Aceldama.</i>

169
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:56,786
Aceldama Field.

170
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:04,712
<i>Take it all. Take it all.</i>

171
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:06,787
Master. The patrol.

172
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:10,048
I don't want anyone
to know who we are yet.

173
00:23:10,147 --> 00:23:12,501
Over here. Come, Brixos.

174
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:15,770
<i>That's it.</i>

175
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:24,248
Hurry, Brixos.

176
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:35,108
Hey. We saw them first.
Be on your way.

177
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:39,614
Oh, by the gods.

178
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:44,052
You are more beautiful than the
priestess at the temple of Ishtar.

179
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:48,720
The two of us will have
a good time together.

180
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:52,457
Leave her alone! She's the daughter
of a very prominent man.

181
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,964
Her father will make you pay dearly
if you touch a single hair on her head.

182
00:23:56,064 --> 00:24:00,334
Oh, her father should keep her
locked up in the house...

183
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:03,102
like any other nice girl...

184
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:06,555
if he doesn't want
to have any trouble.

185
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:10,891
Oh, hold her still.

186
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:22,223
Disappear, you scoundrel.

187
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:25,174
Help! Help me, friend. Help!

188
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:37,715
They've gone.
You need worry no longer.

189
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:43,341
They won't bother
you again, believe me.

190
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,362
What's your name?

191
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:53,694
We've already met.

192
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:16,477
I see that you're not
familiar with our customs.

193
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:18,479
Do not be offended, stranger...

194
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:22,416
but my granddaughter cannot
take the hand of a pagan, ever.

195
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:24,649
The religion of our
forefathers forbids it.

196
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:29,719
Of course. You people are afraid
of being contaminated.

197
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,058
All right. Never mind the hand.

198
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:35,192
But does she have a tongue?

199
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:38,295
Or is she also afraid of, uh,
talking to an unclean stranger?

200
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:40,498
She is not afraid at all.

201
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:43,504
So? Tell me your name.

202
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:48,239
It is not suitable for a young girl
to tell her name to a stranger.

203
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:52,010
All right.

204
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,484
Can I at least take you home,
to avoid you being attacked again?

205
00:25:56,584 --> 00:26:00,421
By the way, that fool
was right about one thing.

206
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,155
What are two good women like you
doing here at this time of night?

207
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:06,160
The streets ofJerusalem
would be safe...

208
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,096
if it weren't for those
foreigners who attacked us.

209
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:12,797
<i>And foreigners like us who rescued you.
But you didn't answer my question.</i>

210
00:26:12,897 --> 00:26:15,933
What are you two doing out in
the streets at this late hour?

211
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,319
We cannot tell you.

212
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:24,441
I'm- I'm afraid you
cannot accompany us home.

213
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,814
<i>It would be-
- Inconvenient? Hmm.</i>

214
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:33,565
Is there anything I may do without compromising you?
- Yes.

215
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,155
I cannot tell
you my name...

216
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:41,838
but you can tell me yours
and you can say where you come from.

217
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:47,034
Thank the gods. I
thought you were a deaf-mute.

218
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:51,539
My name is Titus
Valerios Taurus. I come from Rome.

219
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,921
A Roman.

220
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:58,294
Thank you, Titus
Valerios Taurus.

221
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:02,314
I shall never forget
what you have done for me.

222
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,618
<i>Yes, thank you,
but, uh, we have to go now...</i>

223
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:09,333
before they discover
that we are missing at home.

224
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:16,172
Do not fear for us.
We live close by.

225
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:24,114
Good night, young lady
who cannot say her name.

226
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:28,358
Farewell, Titus
Valerios Taurus.

227
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,027
<i>Master.</i>

228
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:41,220
<i>Master. Another patrol, master.</i>

229
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,002
Master. Master. Quickly.

230
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:07,148
<i>Hail to you,
Pontius Pilate.</i>

231
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:10,292
I hope you have a good reason
to bother me at this time of night.

232
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,654
Has another revolt flared up?

233
00:28:16,753 --> 00:28:20,257
I would never have bothered you
with such a trivial matter.

234
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:23,837
No. It's something
much more serious.

235
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,399
An imperial titulus.

236
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,635
I found it on the body
of a man who died...

237
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:33,236
during a fight with Barabbas
and some Zealots in a tavern.

238
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,840
I suspected him of being
a secret informer of the emperor.

239
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,178
But this titulus could
not have belonged to him.

240
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,949
Witnesses say that the informer was sitting
at a table with another man- a foreigner-

241
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:46,454
and that they were talking
in great secrecy.

242
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:51,656
An imperial envoy has
arrived in Jerusalem unannounced...

243
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:55,941
and the first thing he did was to
ask Tiberius's spy for information.

244
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:01,798
It is obvious. The emperor
has sent an inspector incognito.

245
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:04,569
Do you know where he is now?
- My men searched for him...

246
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:07,041
but lost track of him
in the alleyways of the old city.

247
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,320
Fine. Find him.

248
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,551
What shall we
do if we find him?

249
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:23,221
With the credentials he has,
he can give orders to anyone- even to you.

250
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,368
Aulos Fuscos.

251
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:33,896
I hope you're not tempted to disclose
confidential information...

252
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:36,167
about my administration
to this meddler.

253
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:39,438
Should I fall, so will you.

254
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:42,186
My mistakes are your
mistakes. Remember that.

255
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:57,321
You've never made any mistakes
that I recall, Prefect.

256
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,503
Of course. I've
never committed mistakes.

257
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:09,835
Aulos Fuscos.

258
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:13,937
<i>When you find the man, tell him
that the prefect has invited him to dinner.</i>

259
00:30:14,036 --> 00:30:16,118
He certainly cannot refuse.

260
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:34,295
Excuse me. We were told
thatJudas Iscariot lives around here...

261
00:30:34,394 --> 00:30:36,297
in a place called Aceldama Field.

262
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:41,364
Do you know where it is?
- I don't know anything about anyJudas...

263
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:45,671
but Aceldama Field is over there.

264
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:47,748
Thank you.

265
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:00,821
<i>Judas is dead.
I bought his house.</i>

266
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:06,389
Did Judas have any relatives,
friends? I want to speak to them.

267
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:11,596
Friends? He betrayed
their teacher, a certain Jesus.

268
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:16,416
His friends would kill him
like a dog if he were still alive.

269
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:20,404
Or maybe they wouldn't.

270
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,473
They might forgive him.
They're a strange folk.

271
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:28,498
I must meet them, even one
of them. It's very important.

272
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,520
I don't really
know any of them.

273
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,922
But I do know that someone
is doing his utmost to find them.

274
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:37,975
They say he's a
spy from the temple.

275
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:41,795
What's his name?
- Saul ofTarsus.

276
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:45,496
Where can I find him?
- He usually attends a rabbinical school...

277
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:49,815
close to the Mitzpah market,
just in front of the temple.

278
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:57,642
We've been here half a day
already, master. Nothing so far.

279
00:31:57,742 --> 00:32:02,132
Patience, Brixos. The
key to this work is patience.

280
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,856
There. That's
Saul ofTarsus.

281
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:14,674
But don't tell anyone that I pointed him
out to you. He's a powerful man.

282
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,331
Out of the way!

283
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:05,529
Let Stephen go!
Let my brother go!

284
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:11,294
<i>David, remember
the teachings ofJesus.</i>

285
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:23,746
<i>Come on, young
man. Defend your brother.</i>

286
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:28,732
Come on.

287
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,755
Defend your brother!

288
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,797
No one will harm you if you do.
I give you my word.

289
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,502
Do not use hatred against hatred.

290
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:58,394
Come on. Love him,
defend him! Come on.

291
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,247
It is your duty
to defend your brother.

292
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:15,591
<i>No! No!</i>

293
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:29,804
<i>Stop! You're
all under arrest.</i>

294
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:36,219
Throw down your weapons.

295
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:44,141
Prefect will hear of
no brawling in the street...

296
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,062
especially over
stupid religious differences.

297
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:55,921
After him! After the boy!

298
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,805
Five men. Quickly!

299
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:10,905
Have no fear. I'm a friend.
Just want to ask you a question.

300
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:13,048
Promise you won't shout
if I let you speak?

301
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:18,354
Why didn't you
defend your brother?

302
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,779
Answer me!

303
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:24,266
Why didn't you defend
your brother? Are you a coward?

304
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,589
The rabbi.

305
00:35:28,688 --> 00:35:30,698
The rabbi said so.

306
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,858
"Do not use hatred against hatred."

307
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:37,528
Who's the rabbi?
Who commanded him?

308
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:41,779
Jesus of Nazareth. Let me go.

309
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,172
Jesus of Nazareth? Did you meet him?

310
00:35:46,272 --> 00:35:48,623
Let me go. They're coming!

311
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:53,425
There!

312
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,052
<i>Who are you?</i>

313
00:35:58,152 --> 00:36:00,127
You are under
arrest! Commander!

314
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:04,253
It's all right, Brixos.

315
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:06,833
<i>It's all right.</i>

316
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:10,643
So.

317
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:15,200
I believe we've
already met- in a tavern.

318
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,735
I'm Titus Valerios Taurus
of the Seventh Gemina Legion...

319
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,758
a special envoy
for the emperor.

320
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:29,283
Welcome toJerusalem, Tribune.
We were aware of your presence here.

321
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:31,927
The prefect is expecting you
at Fort Antonia.

322
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:35,931
<i>You're to be
his guests for dinner.</i>

323
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:04,483
<i>Thank you for
your very kind invitation.</i>

324
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:08,321
It's an honor to be a guest
in your magnificent palace, Pontius Pilate.

325
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,324
You're welcome, Ambassador.

326
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:12,624
<i>Claudia Procula.
- Welcome.</i>

327
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:17,909
I've been told that you've had some
marvelous fabrics brought to you from Syria.

328
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:31,074
Welcome. We're honored to have
such a prominent guest.

329
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:33,080
I've never been invited
to dinner before...

330
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,117
by an armed squad
in full fighting trim.

331
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:39,350
I believe it was a necessary measure
to protect your security.

332
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,390
The streets ofJerusalem
are not safe for a Roman citizen.

333
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:45,223
Please be so kind
as to follow me for a moment.

334
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:48,594
<i>Dinner will be
served in a while.</i>

335
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:51,193
I don't fear the streets
ofJerusalem, Prefect.

336
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:54,600
I've spent 5 years- the past
5 years- fighting in Germania.

337
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,039
So I know how to
take care of myself.

338
00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:01,542
The barbarians of the north
fight you out in the open.

339
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,876
Here, the enemy
can be hidden anywhere.

340
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:07,910
He strikes without warning
and then disappears just as quickly.

341
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:10,331
Remember what
happened to you in that tavern?

342
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:15,787
All I want to
do is help you...

343
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:19,104
once you tell me what the
object of your missión is.

344
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:23,730
Dinner is served.

345
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:27,166
<i>My wife, Claudia Procula.
- Hail, Claudia.</i>

346
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:31,233
Tribune.
- The tribune and I have urgent matters to discuss.

347
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,240
We will join you in a while.

348
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,760
But the guests are expecting you.
- Please.

349
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:48,964
<i>Claudia. With that name, your wife
has to be a relative of the emperor.</i>

350
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:53,922
<i>A cousin, yes.</i>

351
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:57,242
But that isn't the reason for my becoming
the governor of this province.

352
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,435
If that were the case, Tiberius would have
entrusted me with an easier task...

353
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:06,502
either Greece or Bithynia.

354
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:08,638
But you have not
answered my question.

355
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:10,785
What is the purpose of your missión?

356
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:20,368
Come, Tribune.
We must join our guests.

357
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:29,270
I'm looking for a body.

358
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:34,815
What? What did you say?

359
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:42,672
A body. A body
that has disappeared.

360
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:46,579
Are you trying to make a fool of me?
- Not at all.

361
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:51,585
It was theJudean rabbi who you
sentenced to death a short while ago.

362
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:54,521
I authorize so
many death sentences.

363
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,768
This is a turbulent town.
Who are you referring to?

364
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:05,315
A certain... Jesus.

365
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:08,684
From the town of Nazareth.

366
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:15,241
Jesus? I do not recall.

367
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:18,841
It is a very common name
in the area.

368
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:24,351
But why are you looking for his body?
- Because it's gone, vanished.

369
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:28,735
Or I should say resurrected,
as the word goes.

370
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:36,062
<i>"Titus Valerios Taurus
to Tiberius Caesar Augustus.</i>

371
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:39,932
<i>"Hail, Emperor.</i>

372
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:44,920
<i>"Following your orders,
I am now in Judea, in the city ofJerusalem.</i>

373
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:48,341
<i>"As soon as I set foot
in this territory...</i>

374
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,211
<i>"despite traveling
incognito, I was attacked...</i>

375
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:54,445
<i>"and one of
our informers killed.</i>

376
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:59,718
<i>"At this moment, I am the reluctant guest
of your prefect, Pontius Pilate.</i>

377
00:40:59,817 --> 00:41:03,752
<i>"He claims to know
nothing about theJudean rabbi...</i>

378
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:06,591
<i>"but allows the man's
followers to be persecuted...</i>

379
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:08,792
<i>"something of which
he is well aware.</i>

380
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:13,699
<i>Evidently, Jesus is
more dangerous dead than alive'"-</i>

381
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,702
"...should he
really be dead...

382
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:19,950
something that I will
soon discover."

383
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:26,376
Your best informers
were not successful...

384
00:41:26,476 --> 00:41:28,815
and they were well acquainted
with their surroundings.

385
00:41:28,914 --> 00:41:31,217
Why do you think
he might succeed?

386
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:34,965
His pride will never let him
abandon his search for the truth-

387
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:38,690
not until he has found it.

388
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,790
Even though he's
well aware that-

389
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:43,696
that the truth may sometimes be
extremely dangerous.

390
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:49,731
Hmm. May I ask you something, Caesar?
- Yes?

391
00:41:49,831 --> 00:41:51,772
I believe you
have sent him there...

392
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:55,939
to discover whether a man
can truly rise from the dead.

393
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:58,107
<i>Is that not so?</i>

394
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:01,722
I've always been curious
about the beyond, Austomedorif...

395
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,900
because I fear nothingness.

396
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:20,249
Where was Pilate?
- He was seated over there.

397
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,437
Sit there.
- But, Tribune-

398
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:26,046
I said sit there and read it.

399
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:43,238
"The senate and the people of Rome
againstJesus of Nazareth."

400
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,745
Who are you? Why have
they brought you here?

401
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:54,449
<i>"Who are you? Why
have they brought you here?"</i>

402
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:04,409
Why do you not speak?

403
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:07,381
Are you not aware
that I can save your life...

404
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,456
<i>or choose to
give you death?</i>

405
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:24,162
<i>"And the prisoner replied,
"You would not have this power...</i>

406
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:28,241
<i>if it hadn't been
given to you by the Most High. "</i>

407
00:43:31,822 --> 00:43:35,174
<i>My power has been
invested in me by the emperor.</i>

408
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:40,743
And you are accused of
proclaiming yourself king of theJews.

409
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:43,250
This is a crime
of lese-majeste.

410
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:45,814
"There are no kings
other than the emperor."'

411
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,531
There are no kings
other than the emperor.

412
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:55,207
What is your answer? Are you
or are you not king of theJews?

413
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:05,168
My kingdom is
not of this worid.

414
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,520
He was crucified up there.

415
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,693
<i>How long did
his agony last?</i>

416
00:44:26,793 --> 00:44:29,473
He died on his own
before the ninth hour.

417
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:37,217
<i>Centurion, did you
examine him afterwards?</i>

418
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,589
I'm a soldier.
I can recognize death.

419
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:54,929
Which one was Jesus' cross?
- That one.

420
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:08,245
Do you know that woman?
- She's his mother.

421
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,624
The mother ofJesus.

422
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:50,960
Who are those other women?

423
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:55,861
I don't know.

424
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,218
<i>Lots of women followed Jesus.</i>

425
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:03,786
They were the most faithful
of his disciples, as you can see.

426
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:06,274
<i>They're faithful to him
even after his death.</i>

427
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:12,930
Women are capable of being very faithful
to those who really love them-

428
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:15,469
until their death and even beyond.

429
00:46:15,568 --> 00:46:17,952
They know what love is.

430
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:43,446
Elijah, before God,
I promise you my daughter.

431
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:55,907
The wedding will take place as
soon as the arrangements can be made.

432
00:46:56,006 --> 00:47:00,245
Before God, I accept
the promise of your daughter.

433
00:47:00,344 --> 00:47:03,390
I pledge to wed her
on the agreed date.

434
00:47:27,624 --> 00:47:30,341
Help me, Grandmother. I can't.

435
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,693
I would rather die.

436
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:41,070
Oh!

437
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,128
I know where he is.
- Who?

438
00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:52,012
Jesus of Nazareth. Follow me.

439
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,303
Where are we? I've never
seen such a desolate place.

440
00:48:01,402 --> 00:48:03,309
It's called Gehenna.

441
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,345
Judeans consider it
the home of demons...

442
00:48:05,445 --> 00:48:07,381
where the souls
of the damned are sent.

443
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,978
It's their hell.

444
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:14,561
This is where
theirJesus is hiding? In hell?

445
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,306
There they are- the followers ofJesus of
Nazareth, fleeing with what they treasure most.

446
00:48:35,405 --> 00:48:40,111
The body ofJesus of Nazareth,
there on the cart below that sheet.

447
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:42,615
It is the proof of his death
without resurrection.

448
00:48:42,715 --> 00:48:48,352
I don't expect any resistance. The followers
ofJesus are cowards. They won't fight.

449
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:50,452
<i>But I fear they might
try to burn the corpse...</i>

450
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,825
in order to eliminate
the proof of his death.

451
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:55,958
I will come down the trail
from the north with my men.

452
00:48:56,058 --> 00:49:00,231
Another group, led by Fuscos, will move in
from the south to block their escape.

453
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,899
If they try to destroy the
body in the meantime, Tribune...

454
00:49:02,998 --> 00:49:05,546
you take the point to lead
a frontal attack from here- agreed?

455
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:19,860
Romans.

456
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:28,869
He's setting the body on fire.

457
00:49:31,014 --> 00:49:32,379
Come, Brixos. Hurry.

458
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:37,610
Come on!

459
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:59,471
Stop!

460
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:04,243
Don't kill us.
We are unarmed.

461
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:16,117
<i>Master! Look out!</i>

462
00:51:02,372 --> 00:51:04,863
Hurry. The tribune is in danger.

463
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,701
Huh!

464
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:47,683
Are you all right, Taurus?

465
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,353
Is this Jesus?

466
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:03,149
Do you recognize him?
- His face is disfigured by death...

467
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:05,167
but his height
and body, yes.

468
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:08,397
It's him. I'm certain.

469
00:52:09,506 --> 00:52:12,324
Look. Nail wounds...

470
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:15,037
on his hands and feet.

471
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:22,366
Brixos. I'm putting you in charge
of getting this body toJerusalem.

472
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:26,252
And you can take these Nazarenes
and the weapons too.

473
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:31,189
I want to examine them.
- Yes, master.

474
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:49,494
<i>Why did you
summon me here, Tribune?</i>

475
00:52:49,594 --> 00:52:51,774
And why are you still bothering
with that dead body?

476
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:56,668
This is not the body
ofJesus of Nazareth.

477
00:52:56,767 --> 00:53:00,702
What are you talking about?
How do you explain the nail holes?

478
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:04,076
Drove nails into these hands.

479
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:06,857
But the skin around
the holes didn't tear.

480
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:10,547
And there was no
bleeding either.

481
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:13,283
They have nothing in common
with the gaping gashes...

482
00:53:13,383 --> 00:53:15,620
suffered by someone who was
hung from a cross for hours.

483
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:18,287
By all the gods.
What do you mean?

484
00:53:18,387 --> 00:53:21,193
That these wounds were inflicted
on this body only recently...

485
00:53:21,293 --> 00:53:24,596
after death, in order
to simulate crucifixion.

486
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:27,364
That this body is a fraud.

487
00:53:27,464 --> 00:53:31,337
It's not the body of
someone who was crucified, Pilate.

488
00:53:31,437 --> 00:53:33,339
This is notJesus of Nazareth.

489
00:53:33,439 --> 00:53:38,176
Just suppositions, fantasies.

490
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:40,179
This is the body ofJesus.

491
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:42,412
The fraud was committed
by his disciples.

492
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:46,751
This is the official story,
and you'll stand by it, otherwise-

493
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:51,638
Regarding the official story,
I've also conducted an investigation into those...

494
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:54,994
Nazarenes.

495
00:53:55,094 --> 00:53:59,538
Investigation? What
kind of investigation?

496
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:05,119
I've been thinking about
their method of fighting.

497
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:10,825
In battle, a man
shows how he was trained.

498
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:17,356
And the way they fought-
It reminded me of only one thing-

499
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:22,422
the arena.

500
00:54:22,522 --> 00:54:25,222
What are you talking about?
- They were gladiators.

501
00:54:25,322 --> 00:54:29,290
<i>Very well-trained gladiators.
- And who do you think planned this trap?</i>

502
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,893
Whoever might
have gained from it.

503
00:54:31,993 --> 00:54:36,735
Surely you're not insinuating-
- I'm not insinuating anything... for the moment.

504
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:39,334
I don't have the proof.

505
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:43,882
But I've included my deductions
in a letter to the emperor.

506
00:54:47,097 --> 00:54:49,347
Forgive my being so stubborn.

507
00:54:49,446 --> 00:54:51,817
I can see now that
you're right, Tribune.

508
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:54,084
We will discover who is behind
this treacherous ambush.

509
00:54:54,184 --> 00:54:56,286
I have no doubts.

510
00:54:56,385 --> 00:54:59,056
And by the way, I have
to ask you for something...

511
00:54:59,155 --> 00:55:02,095
that will cause you some problems
with yourJewish friends...

512
00:55:02,195 --> 00:55:06,047
and their high priests at the temple.
- What?

513
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:10,701
You have visitors.

514
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:12,721
Mary.
- Stephen.

515
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,927
David.
- Brother.

516
00:55:23,266 --> 00:55:25,915
<i>Allowing that
follower ofJesus...</i>

517
00:55:26,015 --> 00:55:29,951
to receive visitors in prison
without our permissión...

518
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,357
is a deliberate offense to us.

519
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:36,694
I beg you...

520
00:55:36,794 --> 00:55:38,928
to explain yourself.

521
00:55:39,028 --> 00:55:43,384
<i>Political reasons
of a superior entity.</i>

522
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:53,127
DenyJesus?

523
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:57,816
Declare that he
was a false prophet?

524
00:55:57,916 --> 00:56:00,062
Stephen, your
life is at stake.

525
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:04,935
<i>No one is asking you
to sacrifice yourself.</i>

526
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:09,929
Even Peter, the
nightJesus was arrested...

527
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:11,796
denied him three times.

528
00:56:11,895 --> 00:56:14,834
Is Peter the one asking me this?

529
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:17,386
No. Only me.

530
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:22,774
They will kill you.
Are you not afraid?

531
00:56:22,874 --> 00:56:26,408
Death... does
not exist, Mary...

532
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,510
and you know that
better than we do.

533
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:30,516
You metJesus.

534
00:56:30,616 --> 00:56:33,182
You met him after
the resurrection.

535
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:35,919
He taught us to love life.

536
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:38,099
<i>He would never
have thrown it away.</i>

537
00:56:39,175 --> 00:56:41,109
Guard, we're leaving.

538
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:45,337
Follow her.

539
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:49,950
<i>Mary Magdalene
follows her heart...</i>

540
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:52,837
but she's asking me too much.

541
00:56:52,937 --> 00:56:54,856
Magdalene!

542
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:02,197
Thank you. And may
peace be with you.

543
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:06,617
<i>May I speak
to you, Rabbi?</i>

544
00:57:06,717 --> 00:57:09,217
You know I'm not a rabbi.

545
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:11,570
You are one for me.

546
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:14,656
Your words are
full of wisdom.

547
00:57:14,756 --> 00:57:16,803
How old are you?

548
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:21,029
Eighteen.

549
00:57:21,129 --> 00:57:23,847
I'm only a year
older than you.

550
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:27,306
How could I be your teacher?

551
00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:29,674
I know what you
want to ask me.

552
00:57:29,773 --> 00:57:32,408
<i>You want to
be released...</i>

553
00:57:32,508 --> 00:57:34,827
from the marriage promise
your father made to Elijah.

554
00:57:36,766 --> 00:57:39,084
My father took that oath.

555
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:41,087
I did not.

556
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:43,387
But how can I
disobey my father?

557
00:57:43,487 --> 00:57:46,055
<i>You can't...</i>

558
00:57:46,154 --> 00:57:48,440
but you could
do something else.

559
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,829
You could speak
to your father...

560
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:58,236
<i>as frankly as
you have spoken to me.</i>

561
00:57:58,336 --> 00:58:00,402
<i>Sooner or later...</i>

562
00:58:00,502 --> 00:58:03,357
you will touch his heart.

563
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:09,880
<i>What is it?</i>

564
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,366
I don't want you
to die, Stephen.

565
00:58:25,548 --> 00:58:28,231
Girl with no name.
- You.

566
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,270
I cannot speak to a
stranger on the street.

567
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:32,271
You can't speak, you
can't tell me your name...

568
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:34,774
but you can be kind and
affectionate with that man in prison.

569
00:58:34,873 --> 00:58:36,810
How can you talk like that?

570
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:39,075
He fooled me in the beginning too,
with his saintly airs.

571
00:58:39,175 --> 00:58:41,176
But now I realize
how he uses all that talk...

572
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:44,346
of resurrection,
universal love...

573
00:58:44,446 --> 00:58:46,751
to enthrall naive giris like you.

574
00:58:46,851 --> 00:58:50,723
How can you talk like that?
He is risking his life.

575
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:54,491
Stephen is worth,000 times more
than you, with all of your arrogance.

576
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,591
Please. Please.

577
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,670
Please.

578
00:59:01,384 --> 00:59:03,302
Forgive me.

579
00:59:03,402 --> 00:59:06,570
Perhaps l- I misunderstood.

580
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:10,807
Lord, why does he not realize
that I cannot speak to him?

581
00:59:10,907 --> 00:59:14,193
But I have to
speak to you.

582
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:19,552
All right. All
right, all right.

583
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:23,163
<i>Since I can't speak to
you, I will speak to the gods.</i>

584
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:26,960
O gods...

585
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:29,861
<i>make her realize that I
was just worried about her...</i>

586
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:32,426
and just wanted to
advise her to be careful.

587
00:59:32,526 --> 00:59:36,402
But if I made a
mistake due to my-

588
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:38,466
<i>Why would she be talking to him?
- Irreverence...</i>

589
00:59:38,566 --> 00:59:42,171
I humbly ask her forgiveness.

590
00:59:42,271 --> 00:59:46,319
And allow her, at least,
to tell me her name.

591
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:53,652
Lord, have the
Roman keep quiet...

592
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:57,319
before we are lapidated
due to his irreverence.

593
00:59:57,419 --> 01:00:01,125
And above all, I beg
you to- to forgive me-

594
01:00:01,224 --> 01:00:04,009
<i>What's he saying?
- For making her cry.</i>

595
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:11,336
Lord, please tell the Roman
that I have not cried at all.

596
01:00:11,436 --> 01:00:13,401
<i>And in any case...</i>

597
01:00:13,501 --> 01:00:15,706
certainly not
because of him.

598
01:00:15,806 --> 01:00:17,839
Wh-What's she saying?

599
01:00:17,939 --> 01:00:21,409
She doesn't want to admit
she's been crying?

600
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:26,515
Oh, yes, I realize
she's a very proud girl.

601
01:00:26,614 --> 01:00:29,387
Oh, my God.

602
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:32,600
May all Romans
be struck by lightning.

603
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:35,561
Yes, but before
I'm struck by lightning...

604
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:37,579
please-

605
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:41,544
At least tell
me your name.

606
01:00:43,486 --> 01:00:45,438
Why is it so important for you?

607
01:00:45,538 --> 01:00:48,184
Because I can't go on
thinking about you...

608
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,926
without knowing your name.

609
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:57,993
My name is Miriam.

610
01:00:59,135 --> 01:01:02,386
But everyone
has called me Tabitha...

611
01:01:02,486 --> 01:01:04,770
since I was a child.

612
01:01:06,342 --> 01:01:08,537
What does it mean?

613
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:12,429
Gazelle.

614
01:01:12,529 --> 01:01:14,596
Hmm.

615
01:01:14,696 --> 01:01:16,652
Gazelle.

616
01:01:18,354 --> 01:01:21,104
I see why they
called you that.

617
01:01:21,204 --> 01:01:24,076
Now let me go,
before someone reports us.

618
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:26,094
One more thing. Wait.

619
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:32,213
Allow me to give
you some advice.

620
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:35,620
Don't be fooled by the followers
of theJesus of Nazareth.

621
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,253
<i>Don't fill your
head with illusions.</i>

622
01:01:38,353 --> 01:01:41,389
You do not know
what you're talking about.

623
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,843
<i>Lfhe has truly
resurrected from the dead...</i>

624
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:50,101
where is he now,
and why is he hiding?

625
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,104
Jesus isn't hiding.

626
01:01:52,204 --> 01:01:55,304
And anyway, I can't
tell you anything about it.

627
01:01:55,403 --> 01:01:59,657
All right, Tabitha. Hmm.

628
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,358
Shalom, Titus
Valerios Taurus.

629
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,622
If you really want
to know aboutJesus...

630
01:02:10,722 --> 01:02:13,423
you should go
out to Bethany.

631
01:02:13,523 --> 01:02:15,691
There is a man there
who can help you.

632
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:19,373
He has two sisters.
His name is Lazarus.

633
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:28,975
Shalom, High Priest.

634
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:32,276
Nathan. I haven't
seen you in a while.

635
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:35,160
I have something to tell you.

636
01:02:43,539 --> 01:02:46,099
Is there anyone here?

637
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:55,700
<i>Lazarus is gone...</i>

638
01:02:55,799 --> 01:02:58,333
but not for good.

639
01:02:58,433 --> 01:03:00,969
How can you say that, master?

640
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,706
Strange-

641
01:03:03,806 --> 01:03:06,909
Place like this must
be worth a lot of money.

642
01:03:07,008 --> 01:03:09,915
Although it's clearly
been abandoned...

643
01:03:10,015 --> 01:03:12,047
no one has taken it over.

644
01:03:12,146 --> 01:03:16,651
Perhaps people think
Lazarus will return.

645
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,657
<i>No one wants this place.</i>

646
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:20,333
It's cursed.

647
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:26,432
But follow us.

648
01:03:26,532 --> 01:03:28,984
We have something to show you.

649
01:03:32,021 --> 01:03:33,939
How did you know
we'd be coming here?

650
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:36,503
We have many friends.

651
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:39,674
I assume you also know what
happened to Lazarus and his sisters.

652
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:44,116
Nothing. They probably realized
they were no longer welcome here and left.

653
01:03:44,215 --> 01:03:47,966
The stone was used to
cover the entrance of the tomb.

654
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:52,156
Lazarus was inside...

655
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:54,289
wrapped in a shroud.

656
01:03:54,388 --> 01:03:57,574
ButJesus came here with
a small group of people...

657
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:03,481
<i>and he performed a miracle.</i>

658
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:16,093
Accept a goblet of wine.
It's from one of our best vineyards.

659
01:04:28,745 --> 01:04:30,679
Go on, Saul. What happened?

660
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:38,210
Take away the stone.

661
01:04:42,592 --> 01:04:46,926
His disciples rolled away the stone
that was sealing the tomb.

662
01:05:06,582 --> 01:05:11,178
Then Jesus raised his arms,
called out loudly.

663
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:14,757
Lazarus.

664
01:05:16,826 --> 01:05:18,851
Come out.

665
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:50,239
And Lazarus left the tomb,
still covered in his shroud...

666
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:53,591
after having lain there
for four days.

667
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:58,212
Did he... bring
him back to life?

668
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:01,085
Just before Pesach.

669
01:06:01,184 --> 01:06:04,151
Is it not oddly appropriate
that this should happen...

670
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,390
right before the Nazarene ladies
returned toJerusalem?

671
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:10,924
He was thus preceded
by the reputation...

672
01:06:11,023 --> 01:06:14,574
of being a man who could
bring the dead back to life.

673
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:21,535
Do you mean it
was... just a show?

674
01:06:21,635 --> 01:06:25,544
A rehearsal. A dress
rehearsal for a show...

675
01:06:25,644 --> 01:06:27,675
that would prove
to be even greater.

676
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:31,460
His own resurrection.

677
01:06:32,602 --> 01:06:34,900
The goblet.

678
01:06:36,138 --> 01:06:40,120
<i>The wine- The
wine was poisoned.</i>

679
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:41,824
<i>Brixos!
- Master!</i>

680
01:06:41,923 --> 01:06:44,539
Master!

681
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:32,219
<i>Titus Valerios Taurus.</i>

682
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:38,963
<i>Titus Valerios Taurus.</i>

683
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:44,496
I'm here.

684
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:48,610
I'm here.

685
01:07:51,013 --> 01:07:53,004
Please-

686
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:57,515
Help me.

687
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,984
Titus Valerios Taurus...

688
01:08:14,084 --> 01:08:16,004
come out.

689
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:49,034
Brixos.

690
01:08:52,475 --> 01:08:54,989
Master.

691
01:08:55,088 --> 01:08:58,525
<i>Master- l-
I tried, master.</i>

692
01:08:58,624 --> 01:09:01,606
I trust that you
are well, noble Taurus.

693
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:10,270
When Pilate finds
out about this...

694
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:13,192
<i>he will have you crucified.</i>

695
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:17,399
I don't think so.

696
01:09:23,305 --> 01:09:25,353
Please forgive
this little demonstration.

697
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:28,191
But you wouldn't
have believed it...

698
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,257
unless you'd
experienced it yourself.

699
01:09:30,357 --> 01:09:32,264
You have died and
come back to life.

700
01:09:32,364 --> 01:09:36,864
What are they saying?
- The wine they offered you was laced with a substance...

701
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,033
<i>that produces a state
of apparent death...</i>

702
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,601
lasting from several hours
to several days.

703
01:09:41,701 --> 01:09:43,704
Your servant was able
to verify it himself.

704
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:46,887
<i>You were dead for
three days and three nights.</i>

705
01:09:49,165 --> 01:09:51,531
It's true, master.

706
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:55,660
But you were not dead.

707
01:09:56,672 --> 01:09:58,590
He was not dead...

708
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,959
just as your fellow townsman
Lazarus was not dead...

709
01:10:02,058 --> 01:10:05,560
orJesus of Nazareth on the cross.

710
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:09,163
Before your eyes,
we have revealed a hoax-

711
01:10:09,263 --> 01:10:14,302
an evil ploy perpetrated
by the followers ofJesus...

712
01:10:14,402 --> 01:10:18,439
on a naive and
gullible people.

713
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:21,576
Go. Go and spread the word...

714
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:25,247
<i>of what you have
witnessed here today.</i>

715
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,848
Forgive us.

716
01:10:27,948 --> 01:10:30,322
Sometimes our methods
are questionable...

717
01:10:30,421 --> 01:10:32,358
but they're necessary.

718
01:10:32,457 --> 01:10:36,626
Should they have been left the chance
to spread their madness...

719
01:10:36,725 --> 01:10:39,462
the followers ofJesus
would have divided us.

720
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:42,029
Your inquiry might have
created such a división.

721
01:10:42,128 --> 01:10:47,101
I believe I can safely
conclude that your inquiry...

722
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,180
is now over.

723
01:10:53,362 --> 01:10:57,148
<i>Longinus, unless
you answer my questions...</i>

724
01:10:57,247 --> 01:11:00,118
I'll be forced to arrest you.
- What are you accusing me of?

725
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:02,283
Of having allowed
Jesus of Nazareth...

726
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,155
to be given a drug that
caused his apparent death.

727
01:11:05,255 --> 01:11:09,392
To make sure he was dead,
I stabbed him with this.

728
01:11:09,491 --> 01:11:12,898
Let him speak, Brixos.

729
01:11:12,998 --> 01:11:15,849
It went all the
way to his heart.

730
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:23,254
Can anyone confirm this?
- My soldiers were with me.

731
01:11:29,832 --> 01:11:31,812
They'll witness what happened.

732
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:35,152
Tribune, this woman
insists on seeing you.

733
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:38,434
She says she has something
very important to tell you.

734
01:11:40,176 --> 01:11:43,061
Who are you?

735
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:46,979
Tabitha.
- They have sentenced Stephen to death.

736
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:50,867
You are the only one
who can help him.

737
01:11:50,966 --> 01:11:55,356
<i>Stephen! Stephen!</i>

738
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:58,986
Go away! Go!

739
01:12:39,735 --> 01:12:41,669
Tabitha.

740
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:44,820
I'll go.

741
01:12:44,919 --> 01:12:47,590
Master, there are
too many of them.

742
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:50,629
<i>Silence!
- There's nothing we can do.</i>

743
01:12:50,729 --> 01:12:52,760
Today...

744
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,735
<i>the Roman prefect authorized
that Stephen be stoned to death.</i>

745
01:12:56,834 --> 01:12:58,799
Lapidation.

746
01:12:58,898 --> 01:13:00,912
Yes. Let us stone him to death.

747
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:10,914
Don't look. Come on.

748
01:13:11,014 --> 01:13:13,127
Brixos, stay here.

749
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:28,946
Stephen.

750
01:13:43,899 --> 01:13:46,197
I will not go
back to his house.

751
01:13:46,402 --> 01:13:48,870
Where will you go?

752
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:54,123
I will look forJesus' followers.

753
01:13:54,223 --> 01:13:57,629
Mary Magdalene told me that
many of them are in Galilee...

754
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:01,161
and that they live there
like brothers.

755
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,344
Do you still believe in the
fairy tales ofJesus of Nazareth?

756
01:14:06,555 --> 01:14:10,341
How can you talk like that
after seeing Stephen's sacrifice?

757
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,878
Stephen acted in good faith.
He was a courageous man.

758
01:14:12,977 --> 01:14:16,077
L- I judged him unfairly.

759
01:14:16,177 --> 01:14:18,313
But I only believe
what my eyes can see...

760
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:20,380
and what my reason can explain.

761
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,219
And what does your reason
suggest to you?

762
01:14:23,319 --> 01:14:26,725
LfJesus is still alive,
his disciples...

763
01:14:26,825 --> 01:14:30,438
are playing on the hopes
of people like you- like Stephen.

764
01:14:31,714 --> 01:14:34,296
For the time being,
they're gathering followers.

765
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:37,600
When the right opportunity arises,
they'll make their move...

766
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:40,071
and take whatever they want.

767
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:42,749
What?
- Power.

768
01:14:43,826 --> 01:14:45,760
Money.

769
01:14:46,829 --> 01:14:49,161
Like all men.

770
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:54,182
That is all that matters to you-

771
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:56,249
power, money.

772
01:14:56,349 --> 01:14:58,920
You are a Roman.

773
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:01,771
You know nothing
about the power of love.

774
01:15:10,819 --> 01:15:14,901
You're right.

775
01:15:15,001 --> 01:15:16,908
I knew nothing about love...

776
01:15:17,008 --> 01:15:19,790
before coming
to this country.

777
01:15:20,829 --> 01:15:23,320
I've encountered love here.

778
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:28,470
I don't want you
to go to Galilee.

779
01:15:30,305 --> 01:15:33,331
I wish you would
come to Rome with me.

780
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:39,245
I want to marry you.

781
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:45,017
I want to make you happy.

782
01:15:46,855 --> 01:15:50,689
L- Give me your hand.

783
01:15:52,895 --> 01:15:54,920
Give me your hand.

784
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:04,498
I have never even
touched a man's hand.

785
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:07,808
It is shameful.

786
01:16:09,211 --> 01:16:11,145
It is forbidden.

787
01:16:12,548 --> 01:16:15,210
I love you.

788
01:16:26,462 --> 01:16:28,453
I love you too.

789
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:27,673
Where are you going?

790
01:17:27,772 --> 01:17:32,340
Your cloak's stained with Stephen's blood.
- Uh-

791
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,542
Go back to your-
Go home and prepare.

792
01:17:34,642 --> 01:17:37,082
Tomorrow is your wedding day.

793
01:17:37,181 --> 01:17:39,747
Yes. It is my wedding day.

794
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:43,316
Mmm.
- You wanted it to be the unhappiest day of my life...

795
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:47,068
but it will be
the happiest...

796
01:17:48,677 --> 01:17:52,761
because today I will be leaving
with the man I love.

797
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:55,328
What-What do you mean?
What are you-

798
01:17:55,428 --> 01:17:58,601
Who is he?
- A Roman.

799
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:01,471
He will take me
with him, far away-

800
01:18:01,571 --> 01:18:04,009
the farthest I
can get from here.

801
01:18:04,108 --> 01:18:07,391
A Roman-Just like your mother!

802
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:13,381
Yes. I am like my mother,
and I am proud of that.

803
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:15,386
Be quiet.
- I love that man.

804
01:18:15,486 --> 01:18:16,921
<i>Be quiet!
- I love him.</i>

805
01:18:17,021 --> 01:18:18,923
<i>Be silent! Silent!</i>

806
01:18:19,023 --> 01:18:20,723
Silent!

807
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:22,727
Be silent!

808
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:26,907
Silent! Silent!

809
01:18:29,017 --> 01:18:31,469
Silent! Silent! Silent!
- No!

810
01:18:31,569 --> 01:18:33,612
No! Nathan!
- Give me-

811
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:46,451
<i>Tabitha!</i>

812
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:49,993
Miriam! Tabitha!

813
01:18:52,407 --> 01:18:54,375
<i>Tabitha.</i>

814
01:18:56,345 --> 01:18:58,336
Tabitha.

815
01:19:00,749 --> 01:19:02,864
Tabitha!
- Tabitha.

816
01:19:02,963 --> 01:19:07,115
Uh-Wake her up! Wake her up!

817
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:18,750
Tabitha! Tabitha!

818
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:20,915
Just-Just go! Go!
- What happened?

819
01:19:21,015 --> 01:19:23,753
At the house. Go!
- Where's Tabitha?

820
01:19:23,853 --> 01:19:25,757
Hurry. Hurry, please.

821
01:19:25,857 --> 01:19:27,855
Hey! Hey!

822
01:19:27,954 --> 01:19:30,377
Hey!

823
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:42,256
Open up!

824
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,580
Who are you?
- I'm the doctor.

825
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,585
Her wounds are very serious.

826
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:55,621
What's wrong with her? Speak up!

827
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,622
She was beaten
on the head repeatedly.

828
01:19:57,722 --> 01:20:00,592
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

829
01:20:00,691 --> 01:20:03,270
<i>It means she's dying.</i>

830
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:09,597
And I was the
one who killed her.

831
01:20:09,697 --> 01:20:12,435
<i>I... and you.</i>

832
01:20:12,535 --> 01:20:15,786
<i>You.
- You-</i>

833
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:20,545
You- How dare you?

834
01:20:20,644 --> 01:20:23,063
We both murdered her.

835
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:27,067
I wanted to keep her
and you wanted to take her away.

836
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:31,653
You wanted to change her.

837
01:20:31,753 --> 01:20:33,731
And this is what happened.

838
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:42,016
Kill me.

839
01:20:44,886 --> 01:20:47,116
Kill me.

840
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:51,239
Stop! What are you doing?

841
01:20:51,339 --> 01:20:53,385
You're not helping her that way.

842
01:21:01,536 --> 01:21:03,488
How can I help?

843
01:21:03,588 --> 01:21:08,441
She only has a few
more hours to live.

844
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:11,979
Where is she?
- Upstairs.

845
01:21:28,864 --> 01:21:30,855
Tabitha.

846
01:21:38,073 --> 01:21:40,439
Am I dying?
- Shh.

847
01:21:42,377 --> 01:21:44,993
What can I do, my love?

848
01:21:45,092 --> 01:21:47,999
Bring the disciples ofJesus here.

849
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:50,108
Let them speak to me-

850
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:54,644
aboutJesus, about his kingdom.

851
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:59,056
Have them pray for me.

852
01:22:04,332 --> 01:22:06,266
Promise me.

853
01:22:07,269 --> 01:22:09,237
I am afraid.

854
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:12,190
It is so dark.

855
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,265
I promise you, my love.

856
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:20,410
You must promise to hold out-

857
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:25,100
to fight with
all your strength...

858
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,155
till I come back to you.

859
01:22:28,423 --> 01:22:30,391
Promise me, Tabitha.

860
01:22:43,104 --> 01:22:45,072
Be strong, my love.

861
01:23:05,493 --> 01:23:07,552
Is this your promised land?

862
01:23:26,514 --> 01:23:30,610
Even a place like this...
can be beautiful.

863
01:24:06,988 --> 01:24:10,287
<i>This is Galilee- the land ofJesus.</i>

864
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:40,338
Hail to you, Mary.

865
01:24:40,438 --> 01:24:42,503
My name is Titus
Valerios Taurus.

866
01:24:42,602 --> 01:24:46,876
I'm a Roman, and I've come
a long way to meet your son.

867
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:50,679
The emperor dispatched
me here to find Jesus...

868
01:24:50,779 --> 01:24:54,292
and to discover
if he was an impostor.

869
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,999
I no longer care
about all this...

870
01:24:59,407 --> 01:25:02,456
because I have
another reason.

871
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:05,525
The woman I love is dying.

872
01:25:05,624 --> 01:25:09,549
She believes in your son,
and now she needs him.

873
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:20,042
Please.

874
01:25:20,142 --> 01:25:22,119
I beg you.

875
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:26,167
I beg you to help me.

876
01:26:02,137 --> 01:26:05,197
Oh, yes.
Thank you very much.

877
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:19,211
Who are you?

878
01:26:21,156 --> 01:26:24,216
My name is Simon,
but they call me Peter.

879
01:26:28,997 --> 01:26:32,079
<i>Why did you
steal the body ofJesus?</i>

880
01:26:32,179 --> 01:26:34,085
<i>Jesus is resurrected.</i>

881
01:26:34,185 --> 01:26:37,988
He's alive.
- If he's alive, where is he now?

882
01:26:38,088 --> 01:26:41,723
He has returned to
his father in heaven.

883
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:46,293
<i>So he's alive, but in heaven.</i>

884
01:26:46,392 --> 01:26:48,815
Very convenient.

885
01:26:50,718 --> 01:26:52,833
The woman I love is dying...

886
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:55,604
because she believes
in your wild ideas.

887
01:26:55,703 --> 01:26:57,906
That's why I've come here-

888
01:26:58,006 --> 01:26:59,910
to ask you to come
toJerusalem for her.

889
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:02,278
For Tabitha.

890
01:27:02,377 --> 01:27:05,682
LfJesus really has left you
with the task of governing his disciples...

891
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:09,215
you must come
and speak to her...

892
01:27:09,314 --> 01:27:11,318
about his kingdom- about him.

893
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:14,807
Tell her the fairy tales
you preach to the poor.

894
01:27:16,444 --> 01:27:19,425
Let her die under the illusión
that a new worid is awaiting her...

895
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:21,466
instead of darkness.
- I cannot.

896
01:27:21,565 --> 01:27:24,333
Why?
- There are persecutions all overJerusalem.

897
01:27:24,433 --> 01:27:26,337
You're just a coward.
- No.

898
01:27:26,437 --> 01:27:28,603
I was told that even
on the day he was crucified...

899
01:27:28,703 --> 01:27:30,608
you denied him three times.

900
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,626
True.

901
01:27:34,162 --> 01:27:36,153
True.

902
01:27:37,532 --> 01:27:39,966
But things are
different now.

903
01:27:41,035 --> 01:27:43,697
I am responsible
for all my brethren.

904
01:27:45,173 --> 01:27:47,558
I cannot leave all of them
to comfort only one.

905
01:27:47,657 --> 01:27:50,258
Charlatans.

906
01:27:50,357 --> 01:27:53,473
You are nothing
but charlatans.

907
01:28:36,057 --> 01:28:38,082
Your people are
similar to mine.

908
01:28:40,795 --> 01:28:44,287
They teach us not to fear
our own death.

909
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:48,919
It's the destiny
of every warrior.

910
01:28:49,019 --> 01:28:53,940
<i>But there's no remedy
against the death of those you love.</i>

911
01:28:56,244 --> 01:28:59,372
Have you ever lost
someone you loved, Brixos?

912
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:08,746
I had a wife and son.

913
01:29:10,825 --> 01:29:13,589
<i>The plague
came to our forests.</i>

914
01:29:15,463 --> 01:29:17,863
That was a battle
I could not fight.

915
01:29:19,801 --> 01:29:21,792
I took them...

916
01:29:23,204 --> 01:29:27,004
and ran away to the
shores of Hyperborea.

917
01:29:29,811 --> 01:29:31,972
But I...

918
01:29:33,548 --> 01:29:36,210
did not run fast enough.

919
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:43,918
So you have nothing to go back to.

920
01:29:48,129 --> 01:29:50,120
Just like me.

921
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:55,101
I have a friend...

922
01:29:56,437 --> 01:29:59,133
master.

923
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:02,641
I have no other friend
as good as you, Brixos.

924
01:30:06,014 --> 01:30:09,366
Perhaps this isn't the
right moment to tell you...

925
01:30:09,465 --> 01:30:14,433
but I have already deposited,
in the prefect's archives...

926
01:30:14,533 --> 01:30:16,671
a deed...

927
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,817
of your release from service.

928
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,300
You are a free
man, my friend.

929
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:38,035
Thank you, Titus
Valerios Taurus.

930
01:30:50,358 --> 01:30:53,850
But I've always
been a free man.

931
01:30:55,063 --> 01:30:56,997
That's true, Brixos.

932
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:27,842
I do not like this place.
- What are you afraid of, Brixos?

933
01:31:27,942 --> 01:31:29,881
There's no danger here.

934
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,556
Drink.

935
01:31:37,038 --> 01:31:40,565
Brixos!

936
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:10,337
Brixos!

937
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:17,628
Brixos, my friend.

938
01:32:17,728 --> 01:32:19,664
Tell your emperor...

939
01:32:19,763 --> 01:32:23,649
It's not worth the effort...

940
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:28,448
Looking for the answer.

941
01:32:31,058 --> 01:32:33,356
We shall all find out-

942
01:32:34,929 --> 01:32:36,779
Brixos.

943
01:32:36,879 --> 01:32:39,162
Sooner or later.

944
01:32:40,234 --> 01:32:42,293
My friend.

945
01:32:49,877 --> 01:32:52,459
Yes, my friend?

946
01:32:52,559 --> 01:32:54,481
Friend.

947
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:57,541
My friend.

948
01:33:36,123 --> 01:33:39,639
Last night the doctor said that her soul
was hovering between life and death...

949
01:33:39,738 --> 01:33:42,309
<i>but this morning
she didn't seem too-</i>

950
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:45,729
<i>You came alone.
You didn't manage to-</i>

951
01:33:59,313 --> 01:34:01,645
I haven't kept my promise.

952
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,368
Forgive me, Tabitha.

953
01:34:07,468 --> 01:34:10,185
Forgive me.

954
01:34:16,898 --> 01:34:20,379
You-You're so
cold, my-my love.

955
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:23,949
A doctor- Call
a doctor. Hurry.

956
01:34:24,049 --> 01:34:25,869
It's too late.

957
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:31,444
No.

958
01:34:33,014 --> 01:34:35,764
Tabitha. Tabitha.

959
01:34:35,864 --> 01:34:39,568
<i>Roman, you must be strong.
- Tabitha. Tabitha.</i>

960
01:34:39,667 --> 01:34:42,770
Tabitha's soul
is watching over us...

961
01:34:42,869 --> 01:34:44,791
<i>from above.</i>

962
01:34:50,064 --> 01:34:53,416
<i>Master, a man has arrived.</i>

963
01:34:53,516 --> 01:34:57,950
Who is it?
- He comes from Galilee.

964
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:00,924
He is one of those followers
ofJesus of Nazareth.

965
01:35:01,024 --> 01:35:04,557
<i>I told him that this
is the home of a Pharisee...</i>

966
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:07,136
<i>that it is
prohibited by law.</i>

967
01:35:14,155 --> 01:35:17,670
Let him in.
- But, master, he is a follower-

968
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:19,749
Shh. Shh.

969
01:35:22,129 --> 01:35:24,097
Let him in.

970
01:35:30,338 --> 01:35:32,272
My love.

971
01:35:47,388 --> 01:35:49,322
It's me.

972
01:35:51,092 --> 01:35:53,544
Peter.

973
01:35:53,644 --> 01:35:56,791
<i>Is this Tabitha?
- Yes.</i>

974
01:36:00,601 --> 01:36:02,967
It's too late.

975
01:36:04,171 --> 01:36:06,139
You've come too late.

976
01:36:07,742 --> 01:36:10,472
<i>It's too late. She's dead.</i>

977
01:36:19,253 --> 01:36:21,380
Leave me alone with her.

978
01:36:46,781 --> 01:36:48,749
<i>And pray.</i>

979
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:56,148
Come. Let's do what he says.

980
01:37:00,795 --> 01:37:02,729
Come.

981
01:37:24,618 --> 01:37:26,552
I have to go.

982
01:37:27,621 --> 01:37:29,539
The Pharisee informers...

983
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:33,043
must have already
reported my arrival here.

984
01:37:33,143 --> 01:37:37,109
Thank you for
your faith, Roman.

985
01:37:37,209 --> 01:37:39,428
I have no faith.

986
01:37:42,503 --> 01:37:45,619
So you say, but you
have demonstrated...

987
01:37:45,718 --> 01:37:49,437
more faith than many of those
who shout it out in the temple.

988
01:37:51,612 --> 01:37:53,739
Farewell, Taurus.

989
01:38:03,457 --> 01:38:05,425
Now go to her.

990
01:39:15,429 --> 01:39:17,397
Taurus.

991
01:39:19,066 --> 01:39:21,000
Is it you?

992
01:39:41,088 --> 01:39:43,056
Tabitha.

993
01:39:49,496 --> 01:39:51,760
Tabitha.

994
01:39:54,134 --> 01:39:56,052
<i>"The missión you
have entrusted me with...</i>

995
01:39:56,152 --> 01:39:58,217
<i>"has succeeded.</i>

996
01:39:58,317 --> 01:40:03,058
<i>"I am now fully convinced
thatJesus of Nazareth rose from the dead.</i>

997
01:40:03,157 --> 01:40:07,429
<i>"He lives today,
and I have witnessed his power.</i>

998
01:40:07,528 --> 01:40:10,664
<i>"My inquiry has proven
that the words ofJesus...</i>

999
01:40:10,764 --> 01:40:12,866
<i>"have the power to change
those who listen.</i>

1000
01:40:12,965 --> 01:40:16,434
<i>"We Romans
dominate the worid in fear...</i>

1001
01:40:16,534 --> 01:40:21,444
<i>"but here I've discovered
the beginning of another worid-</i>

1002
01:40:21,544 --> 01:40:23,508
<i>"of another kingdom-</i>

1003
01:40:23,608 --> 01:40:26,781
<i>"where men don't live
according to fear...</i>

1004
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,165
<i>but according to love. '"</i>

1005
01:40:31,372 --> 01:40:34,156
Are we ready to leave?

1006
01:40:34,255 --> 01:40:36,159
Yes, Uncle.

1007
01:40:36,259 --> 01:40:38,791
Everything's ready.

1008
01:40:38,891 --> 01:40:43,362
Forgive me, but I must insist
on dissuading you.

1009
01:40:43,461 --> 01:40:47,134
Consider your state of health,
to travel all the way to Rome.

1010
01:40:47,234 --> 01:40:50,669
I want to surprise our senators.

1011
01:40:50,768 --> 01:40:53,407
The matter I want to submit
to them is much too important.

1012
01:40:53,507 --> 01:40:56,258
We leave tomorrow as planned.

1013
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:03,250
<i>"And perhaps the teachings
of this little-known teacher...</i>

1014
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:05,722
<i>"really do change
the hearts of men...</i>

1015
01:41:05,821 --> 01:41:09,023
<i>"and steer them
towards peace rather than war.</i>

1016
01:41:09,123 --> 01:41:11,089
<i>"I will let you judge
if whether or not...</i>

1017
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:13,327
<i>this is positive or
negative for the empire. '"</i>

1018
01:41:13,426 --> 01:41:16,929
Caligula. The physician says
that the emperor was almost dying...

1019
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,969
and now has regained consciousness.

1020
01:41:19,069 --> 01:41:21,269
But he'll never reach Rome
in his condition.

1021
01:41:21,369 --> 01:41:23,619
We have to stop this journey.

1022
01:41:26,927 --> 01:41:28,941
<i>Mmm.
- Hail.</i>

1023
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,760
The worst is over.
- Go.

1024
01:41:34,201 --> 01:41:36,350
<i>Uh-</i>

1025
01:41:36,449 --> 01:41:38,822
I've prepared the report
for the senate.

1026
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:41,623
May I know the
subject, Uncle?

1027
01:41:41,722 --> 01:41:46,326
"I, Tiberius Caesar,
Emperor of Rome...

1028
01:41:46,426 --> 01:41:48,630
"return to the
senate today...

1029
01:41:48,729 --> 01:41:52,332
"in order to submit an important matter
to the fathers of Rome.

1030
01:41:52,432 --> 01:41:55,203
"It regards a new cult...

1031
01:41:55,303 --> 01:41:59,074
<i>"that has sprung up
in the prefecture ofJudea...</i>

1032
01:41:59,174 --> 01:42:01,376
"and which preaches
peace and harmony...

1033
01:42:01,475 --> 01:42:05,078
<i>"and I propose that you
publicly recognize it...</i>

1034
01:42:05,178 --> 01:42:07,747
as the new religion of the empire."

1035
01:42:07,847 --> 01:42:10,417
But the cult ofJesus...

1036
01:42:10,516 --> 01:42:13,052
denies the emperor's divinity.

1037
01:42:13,152 --> 01:42:16,357
Does this old ruin look
like the body of a god?

1038
01:42:16,457 --> 01:42:20,161
How can you foster a religion
that states that all men are equal?

1039
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:23,599
The free and the slaves,
the Romans and the barbarians...

1040
01:42:23,699 --> 01:42:27,267
men and women alike?

1041
01:42:27,366 --> 01:42:29,549
Reconsider, Uncle.

1042
01:42:31,158 --> 01:42:33,126
My decisión is final.

1043
01:42:40,768 --> 01:42:42,702
So be it.

1044
01:42:43,704 --> 01:42:47,538
Go now.
- So be it, Uncle.

1045
01:44:28,876 --> 01:44:31,761
Do you want to be crucified
for what you have seen...

1046
01:44:31,861 --> 01:44:36,699
or do you want
to swear allegiance...

1047
01:44:36,798 --> 01:44:38,808
to the new emperor?

1048
01:44:44,858 --> 01:44:50,545
Hail to you,
Gaius Caesar Caligula...

1049
01:44:50,644 --> 01:44:53,862
emperor of the Romans.

1050
01:45:02,809 --> 01:45:07,197
You will take the
tragic news to the senate.

1051
01:45:07,296 --> 01:45:11,134
May he be granted
all the honors...

1052
01:45:11,233 --> 01:45:13,880
that he deserves...

1053
01:45:14,955 --> 01:45:18,673
and be proclaimed a god,
as, no doubt...

1054
01:45:18,772 --> 01:45:21,374
shall be done for
myself too, one day.

1055
01:45:21,474 --> 01:45:24,881
Regarding his proposal
for this Judean god-

1056
01:45:24,981 --> 01:45:27,365
burn it.

1057
01:45:32,139 --> 01:45:34,437
I want an order
to be sent toJudea.

1058
01:45:36,843 --> 01:45:41,246
Titus Valerios Taurus is...

1059
01:45:43,817 --> 01:45:46,251
to be put to death.

1060
01:45:51,191 --> 01:45:55,491
Destroy every document
that regards his inquiry.

1061
01:45:56,663 --> 01:45:59,461
As you command, Emperor.

1062
01:46:01,735 --> 01:46:07,037
No one will rob me
of my immortality...

1063
01:46:11,278 --> 01:46:13,439
Uncle.

1064
01:46:14,648 --> 01:46:16,513
Soldier!

1065
01:46:18,385 --> 01:46:21,602
It's urgent- for
the prefecture ofJudea.

1066
01:46:21,702 --> 01:46:24,851
It's a death sentence. Go.

1067
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:32,649
<i>"It is my duty to
end my letter to you...</i>

1068
01:46:32,748 --> 01:46:35,315
<i>"by informing you that,
as for myself...</i>

1069
01:46:35,414 --> 01:46:37,787
<i>"I shall never
return to Rome...</i>

1070
01:46:37,886 --> 01:46:40,621
<i>"but I will always remain loyal
to the Roman Empire...</i>

1071
01:46:40,721 --> 01:46:42,698
<i>and its emperor. '"</i>

1072
01:46:46,947 --> 01:46:48,865
<i>Hail.
- Hail.</i>

1073
01:46:48,965 --> 01:46:52,869
I'm looking for a tribune-
a certain Titus Valerios Taurus.

1074
01:46:52,969 --> 01:46:55,934
Do you know him?
- No. I've never heard of him.

1075
01:46:56,034 --> 01:46:59,459
Hail.
- Hail.

1076
01:47:20,314 --> 01:47:22,896
<i>"I have decided to live
amongst the followers ofJesus...</i>

1077
01:47:22,995 --> 01:47:25,998
<i>"in the hope that I might gain a
place for myself in the new worid...</i>

1078
01:47:26,097 --> 01:47:29,647
<i>"which I am certain
is being prepared.</i>

1079
01:47:42,903 --> 01:47:44,821
<i>"So farewell.</i>

1080
01:47:44,921 --> 01:47:47,723
<i>"Don't search for me, because
no one will find me where I am going.</i>

1081
01:47:47,823 --> 01:47:49,788
<i>"This is my last letter.</i>

1082
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:53,695
<i>"From Titus Valerios Taurus, once
commander of the Seventh Gemina Legion...</i>

1083
01:47:53,795 --> 01:47:57,773
<i>to Tiberius Caesar Augustus,
emperor of the Romans. '"</i>
