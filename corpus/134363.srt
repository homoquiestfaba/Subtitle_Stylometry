- Something wrong, Mr. Bast?
- No, not at all.

32
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,085
l was curious if you'd
started weighing college options.

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,149
Options? Uh...

34
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,820
Heard of the Helen Stoller
Physics Scholarship?

35
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,954
No.

36
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:47,931
lt's given to a student from this state
who shows most promise in science.

37
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,935
Wouldn't that be Ann or... Wyatt?

38
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,938
No, it's you.

39
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,405
You have a calling, Casey.

40
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,807
l do?

41
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,879
- What is it?
- Physics.

42
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,446

43
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,244
- Uh... sure.
- You're very lucky.

44
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,286
Most people search their
whole lives for their calling.

45
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,084
- How do you know you have a calling?
- Your brilliant teacher tells you.

46
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,854
And of course your 1 1 straight A-pluses
on exams is a hint.

47
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,795
You'll need a letter from me
for the scholarship

48
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,197
and think about a special
physics project over the summer.

49
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,963
Something unusual but personal.

50
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,630
Let them know you a little.

51
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,573
- He says it's my calling.
- QED.

52
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:33,772
How is this ''quite easily demonstrated''?
You're as good in physics as l am.

53
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,508
Not even close. l grind, you glide.

55
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,086
One day that guy will wake up
and realize he needs a math tutor.

56
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,217
And that tutor will be me.

57
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:52,521
Figure out how to get us invited to
even one party and you win the Nobel.

58
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,877
Hey, you're Casey, right?

59
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,148

62
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,986
You're in chem lab

63
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,064

- Can you give that to him?

64
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,133

65
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,231

67
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:39,274
lf he uncovered a scholarship
l didn't know about, he's a genius.

68
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,745
And to think they pay him
almost nothing.

69
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:46,217
The devaluation of teachers
in our society, it just...

70
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,946
- lt blows my mind.
- Mom.

71
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,784
l'm back. Sorry.

72
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,024
l have to figure out
what he wants from me.

73
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,790
l mean, what is
a personal science project?

74
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:02,925
lsn't the nature of science supposed
to be completely unbiased and factual?

75
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,095
Now he wants the inner me, too?

76
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:10,073
The whole secret of the study of nature
lies in learning how to use one's eyes.

77
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,078
- You know who said that?
- l'm guessing it was a woman.

78
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:17,081
That was written by George Sand,
a woman forced to use a man's name

79
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,242
because she couldn't get published.

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,378
- Mom.
- Okay.

81
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,718
Anyway, l always tell my students,

82
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,556
''You'll know your topic

Gen! Brian, she's training.

- Gen can't eat that.

- Not enough.

- A half-hour?
- Not if you wanna win.

156
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,361
You should coach our basketball team.
We could use a kick in the butt.

159
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,007
l do not want him coming here

But l never get to see him.
Every other girl l know...

161
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:34,089
You're not like the other girls.
Winners make sacrifices.

162
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,922
Maybe they just cheat.

163
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,962
- Turn that off!
- Sorry.

164
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,092
Take it from the layback.

165
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,616
The conclusion's too simplistic.

166
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,389
The kinetic energy in a jump

167
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,863
equals half the skater's mass
times velocity squared, minus...

168
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,458
No, l could barely understand it.

169
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,002
But...?

170
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,904

but it's just a little bit...

l have to make it personal.

173
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:30,011
- How do l do that?
- l don't know.

174
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,982
Put more you in it.

175
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,814
Oh, excuse me, Tina.

176
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,017
ls there any way
that l could take a few lessons?

177
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,654
l think l might be able to write better
about the physics principles

178
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,755
if l'm the one actually applying them.

179
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,993
- lf there's any way l could...
- Fine.

180
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,569
We're starting a novice class
for the summer.

181
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,332
Three afternoons a week.

182
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,269
$800.

183
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,107
$800?

184
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,271
- Popcorn! l want popcorn!
- Where are my Gummi Bears?

185
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,407
- l gave them to you.
- [boy] Four hot dogs!

186
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,543
- Oh, l'm sorry...
- You touched that with your fingers.

187
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,884
Oh, fine. You don't want it?
l'll eat it.

188
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,185
Oh, you breathed on it!

189
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,191
You shouldn't work here.

190
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,596
You're here again?

191
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,830
Um... l'm working.
lt's for my science project.

192
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,701
Aren't you going overboard
with this project?

193
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:31,436
No, l'm totally committed to it,
like you're committed to skating.

194
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,446
Whatever. l'm starving.
B.L.T. here. Hold the B, heavy on the L.

195
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,141
Um... sure.

196
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:41,312
Beef patty.
Squish it till it's dry. No bun.

197
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,514
- Salad for me.
- Coming up.

198
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:48,252
Just iceberg lettuce, half a cup
of garbanzos and a lemon wedge.

199
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,696
Oh, and a quarter cup of cheese.

200
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,562
Ooh, cheese!

201
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,659
lt's Saturday.
l can pig out if l want to.

202
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,330
l don't know what's wrong.
l'm popping my Lutz.

203
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,532
lt's all that cheese.

204
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,008
Would you shut up?

205
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:09,104
[Tiffany] l've gotta focus. l heard
Zoey Bloch's been sticking a quad.

206
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,274
That is a rumor.
Which she probably started herself.

207
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,682
Early in the season
for stupid head games.

208
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,950
- [Gen] Not for Zoey.
- Food's ready!

209
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,956
That is way more than a quarter cup.

210
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,694
Um... lt's $1 .65,

211
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,599
$2.35 and $3.35.

212
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:36,767
That's $ 7.30. Or if you split it
the other way, it's $1 .75 and $5.55.

213
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,108
Whoa. You can keep it all
if you just stop doing that.

214
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,841
[laughter]

215
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,442
You're welcome.

216
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,786
All right, everybody.
Welcome to our Snowplow Sam class.

217
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,986
Let's line up.

218
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,030
Lookin' good.

219
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,268
Class, can you tell our assistant
the most important rule for this class?

220
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,573
- Mom...
- [all] Never be late.

221
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,081
Right. We have a lot to do

222
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,916
if we are going to be ready
for our recital in August.

223
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,081
We are going to work on our toe loop.

224
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,286
Our Lutz.

225
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,998
[children gasp]

226
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,264
But first, all of you
have to get comfortable

227
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,637
with throwing your bodies into the air.

228
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,903
Casey, you're the physics whiz.

229
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,309
What's that rule about what goes up?

230
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,177
Technically,
it's that every particle attracts...

231
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,681
Casey.

232
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,775
Must come down.

233
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,586
This... is your new best friend.

234
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,441
Oh! Oh...

235
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,071
Look, could you try not to, like,
squish me?

236
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,410
l'm sorry.

237
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,213
Casey. Pull your arms in tighter.
They're throwing you off balance.

238
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,049
- Arms in.
- Okay.

239
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,590
Now try that about 5,000 more times.

240
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,126
- Right.
- [Tina] Push over on your right leg.

241
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,063
[Tina] Don't look at your feet.
Look straight ahead.

242
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,797
Jeremy!
That toe pick is there for a reason!

243
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,304
You dig it in.
Or no friends over for a week.

244
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,733
This is a lot of pressure for a recital.

245
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:56,747
lt's not only a recital.
lt's a U.S.F.S.A.J.S.T.

246
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,510
Earth speak, please?

247
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:02,987
lt's the first step
in qualifying for the regionals.

248
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,081
- l mean for us kids.
- Oh.

249
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,820
- You don't have to do it.
- That's good.

250
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,953
Because it's not humanly possible.

251
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,749
[# Michelle Branch:
<i>You Set Me Free]</i>

252
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,791
# <i>Can't you see</i>

253
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:47,189
# <i>There's a feeling</i>
<i>that's come over me</i>

254
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,359

255
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,036
# <i>You're the only one that leaves me</i>

256
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,507

# <i>And you set me free</i> #

264
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,108
Are you out of your mind?!

265
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,537
[bang]

266
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,342
[squeals]

267
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:44,281
Hey, don't you know anything?
No skating when the Zamboni's out.

268
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,950
l'm fine. l'm fine.

269
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,858
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're fine?

270
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,789
Okay.

271
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,695
l'm sorry.

272
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:54,959
[sighs]

273
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,071
Look, you wanna tell me
what was in your head?

274
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,338
l've never skated on
such a smooth surface before.

275
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,208
l wanted to see what it was like.

276
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,612
- Lake skater?
- Pond. Near my house.

277
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:17,450
- Look, you need a hand.
- No! l'm good to go.

278
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,922
Oh!

279
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,927
[Teddy laughs]

280
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,831
You must really want that A.

281
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,465
Wow, that's a lot of Styrofoam.

282
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:41,138
lt's not for an A.
lt's for a physics scholarship.

283
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:48,251
What, like, uh... inertia and drag
and velocity and all that?

284
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,686
- How do you know about that?
- l'm into cars.

285
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,724
Get this baby out on the road,
l can open her up to...

286
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,384
...seven miles an hour.

287
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,396
Blow the doors off
any street-sweeper in town.

288
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,265
Um... l should get home.

289
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,207
Yeah, you should.

290
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,476
Can't do the ice until you're off.

291
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,709
Right.

292
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,217
Sure.

293
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,412
Well...

294
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,929
How's it coming?

295
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,800
lt's coming.

296
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,774
lt takes incredible training and effort

297
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,310
and there's artistry involved
but l'm sorry,

298
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,643
l just can't get past
the twinky little outfits.

299
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,378
Mom, they're actually
very aerodynamically sound.

300
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,354
lt sets us back 50 years.

301
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,688
lf l ever saw you squeezed into one of
those things, l'd probably start crying.

302
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
Believe me, you never will.

303
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,388
[kiss]

304
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,726
[Mom] Will you get some sleep?

305
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,994
Please?

306
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,295
Hello.

307
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,633
This is my video presentation.

308
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,037
Hi. l'm Casey Carlyle.

309
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,938
Cut a second.

310
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,102
l sound like a driver's ed movie.

311
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,578
[Ann] Relax.
Do it like you're talking to me.

312
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,172
Hey, there. l'm Casey.

313
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,076
Oh, my God.
l forgot my last name.

314
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,347
Can l start over?

315
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,015
Hi. l'm Casey Carlyle.

316
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,221
l decided to see if l could make myself
prove my own hypothesis

317
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,024
on the application of physics

318
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,794
to the required elements
of competitive figure skating.

319
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,533
Now, l'm going to increase
the centripetal force

320
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,664
by tucking in my arms.

321
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,335
This will increase
my moment of inertia,

322
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,742
so l will spin...

323
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,905
...faster.

324
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:01,077
l'll increase the height of my jump
by applying more force to my toe pick.

325
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,057
- You know, you look kinda hot.
- Shut up.

326
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:13,029
l'm gonna start off with a bad one.
For the before shot.

327
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,426
- Yeah, that pretty much blew.
- Okay.

328
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,632
- Now you're making me mad.
- [Ann] Good.

329
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:52,527
When you sign with Nike,
remember l wear size six and a half.

330
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,566
l want to do the recital.

331
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,405
For science.

332
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,474
Be here tonight, 5:30.

333
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,973
Okay.

334
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,989
Mm! Tina... l have this
Harvard alumni tea thing at three.

335
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,922
Then, what are we talking about?

336
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,688
No, it's okay. l'll make it.

337
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,397
Um...

338
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,161
You have nothing to wear.

339
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,760
Come by my house at noon. Maybe
one of my old things will work for you.

340
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,466
Wow. Okay.

341
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,171
What?

342
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,280
[Casey] Thanks!

343
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,758
[knock on door]

344
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,564
- [Mom] Sweetie?
- Just a second!

345
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,468
[knock on door]

346
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,944
Hold on!

347
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,575
- Almost ready?
- Uh-huh.

348
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,517
l have a surprise for you.

349
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,027
That does it.

350
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,528
Perfect.

351
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,224
l think the whole effect
is very grown up,

352
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,961
with a nod to femininity.

353
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,333
We've evolved past flaunting it,
but we don't have to deny it.

354
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,304
l mean, you are going to be mingling

355
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:40,606
with your future prospective
classmates and professors,

356
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:44,773
and l really wanted the look to say,
''We are serious.''

357
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,975
Well, it definitely succeeds.

358
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,256
Mom, we don't have to stay at this thing
for more than an hour, right?

359
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,725
Um, because...
there's something l have to tell you.

360
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,593
Oh... Oh, honey.

361
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,360
- What was that?
- l've been so worried.

362
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:06,803
You've been living at that rink,
but you're here, now.

363
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:11,671
And you're excited, because
you understand what's really important.

364
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,869
Look, l've got goose bumps.

365
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:20,578
l'm sorry, that was so type A of me.
Mom disease.

366
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,780
Just relax. Just be yourself.

367
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,949
Your normal, poised,
charming, articulate...

368
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,252
Mom...

369
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,056
Do you wanna go over it
one more time?

370
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:35,293
Hi. l'm Casey Carlyle,

371
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,064
and l'm attracted
to the physics program because...

372
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,900
Physics rocks.

373
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,499
ln sophomore year, you can join
the Quantum Club and that rocks

374
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:48,239
because we compete against
Cal Tech, MlT and Stanford.

375
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,612
Last year, our ion particle accelerator
took first place.

376
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,082
lt rocked.

377
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,552
Sounds really, um... rockin'.

378
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,417
lt is, it really is.

379
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:03,187
Do you know what l think is great?
lf Casey's scholarship works out,

380
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:08,961
l'm sensing that you two will be
spending scads of time together.

381
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,069
Hors d'oeuvre?

382
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,164
Oh, how wonderful, bruschetta.

383
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,335
lf you have some time right now,

384
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:23,403
l'll take you through
the entire physical sciences syllabus.

385
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:28,212
We have got nothing but time!
Don't we, Case?

386
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,719
Great!

387
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,682
l know l'm late. l'm sorry.

388
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,626
That's the first rule.

389
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,468
[Tina] All right, let's get ready.
Come on.

390
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,505
- That's what she said...
- l have to do two turns...

391
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,096
- Really?
- Yeah.

392
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,769
We're supposed to go round
the side, remember?

393
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,970
- Oh...
- lt's right there.

394
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,439
- Right there, is that better?
- Yeah...

395
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,618
Deep breath.

396
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,730
And then you let it out.

397
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,326
- lt didn't work.
- Come on.

398
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,837
Okay, everybody.

399
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,171
[Tina] l'll take that.

400
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,108
- [whispers] Good luck.
- Thanks.

401
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,146
[Tina] Nice and slow.

402
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,877

- [girl] You skipped two levels.

[gasps and exclamations]

457
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,917
- Why didn't l skip two levels?
- Because you're six, Lily.

458
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,289
Junior level is where
Gen and Nikki and Tiff are at.

459
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,522
ls that true, Tina?
That l'm on a junior level?

460
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,695
Yes, it's true.

461
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,739
Okay, everybody, let's get changed.

[Gen] Come on, everybody. Let's go.

463
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,736
So, if l...

464
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,772
- lf l wanted to compete?
- You can't.

465
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,374
Why not?

466
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:58,616
What happened was, the judges saw the
same thing l've been seeing all summer.

467
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,717
You got some raw talent. That's not
enough for a shot at the regionals.

468
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:07,822
You need a coach, a valet,
a choreographer, private ice time.

469
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,959
Nikki's parents took out
a second mortgage to do this.

470
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,560
- And Tiffany's dad works two jobs.
- Oh.

471
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,833
- Where d'you get those skates?
- Garage sale.

472
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:21,002
They're falling off your feet.
You need custom boots, $600 minimum,

473
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,809
and the blades need to be sharpened
every six weeks.

474
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,282
You get it?
l'm sorry. lt is what it is.

475
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,620
You have to want it. You have to
want it more than anything else.

476
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,317
lt's not something you do on a whim.

477
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,488

478
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,863

479
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:47,462
You know what l was thinking,
Miss Senior?

480
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:51,702
This is the last first day of school.

481
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:56,179
Because the next first day,
you'll be in a dorm.

482
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,647
So l went a little nuts.

483
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,151
l made pancakes with white flour.

484
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,883
[Nikki] Can you believe summer's over?

485
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,789
We're wasting our lives here.

486
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,828
[clapping]

487
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,594
- Heard you landed a double.
- Tiff!

488
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,536
- Well? That took me two years.
- Really?

489
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,076
- So l guess we'll see you then?
- No, you won't.

490
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,977
Not at the rink.
l can't train with you guys.

491
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,015
Why not?

492
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,617
Um, l can't afford it.

493
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,210
- Oh!
- Yeah.

494
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,881
But, um, it's been fun.

495
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:47,494
Look, Casey.
l'll tell you something, all right.

496
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,090
You don't know how lucky you are.

497
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,136
- For what?
- To have a life.

498
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:56,833
- You think l have a life?
- l know you do.

499
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,468
You have TV time, and friend time...

500
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,809
But you get to skate all you want.

501
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,508
[laughs] More than l want.

502
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,915
l'd love to be you.

503
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:12,115
Have a Saturday night,
see your boyfriend...

504
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:15,351
- Yeah...
- Eat what you want.

505
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,293
Like bread.
Buckets and buckets of bread.

506
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,490
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo! Who cares?

507
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,591
Who cares about all that stuff?

508
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,262
Don't you just wanna skate all the time?

509
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,633
- No.
- No.

510
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,507
What's the matter with you people?
Are you insane?

511
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,102
The Jumping Shrimp is a skating machine.

512
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,014
- ''The Jumping Shrimp''?
- My mom copyrighted it.

513
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,483
See ya.

514
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,042
Scary.

515
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,918

doesn't make the jumps for you.

858
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:29,097
# <i>And I feel like I just got home</i>

859
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,801
# <i>And I feel</i>

860
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:37,040
# <i>And I feel like I just got home</i>

861
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:40,571
# <i>And I feel</i>... #

862
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,618
[excited chatter]

863
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,918
Number one! Yes!

864
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:52,791
- Yeah!
- You crushed, baby!

865
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,126
lt's only the short, shorty.

866
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,803
- [Gen] Fourth.
- We'll take it.

867
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,805
Fifth, that's great!

868
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,171
Yeah, but fifth
doesn't go to sectionals.

869
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,109
Skate a clean program tonight,
you can move up.

870
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,271
Knock me out of fourth.

871
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:19,782
Casey,
you almost lost a boot out there.

872
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:24,519
- l know, it's giving out.
- l think you'd better come with me.

873
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:30,193
- How do they feel?
- l really can't accept these.

874
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,666
Just show me you deserve them.

875
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,295
And we'll need a pair of blades.

876
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,930
l'll have them sharpened for you
right away.

877
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,635
Tina, l can't believe
that you would help...

878
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,371
No fawning.

879
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,775
No.

880
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,541
Just...

881
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,377
Thank you.

882
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,853
[PA] <i>And the next performer</i>
<i>in the Junior Ladies Free Skate</i>

883
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,154

884
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,717
[applause]

885
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,097
[pop music]

886
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,968
[crowd] Oh!

887
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,663
[nervous chatter]

888
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,369
Who is it?

889
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,471
And that's how it's done, dwarf.

890
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:27,914
Shut up, pincushion.

891
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,814
[Nikki's mom] Come on, sweetie.

892
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,910
Excuse me.

893
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:38,258
l'm going to sectionals!

894
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,589
Good girl!

895
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:42,130
Congratulations!

896
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,305
Are those new?

897
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,940
- Yeah.
- Are you crazy?

898
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,178
You can't compete on new skates.

899
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,278
They take, like,
a minimum of ten days to break in.

900
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,187
- Everybody knows that.
- But Tina didn't tell me.

901
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:11,488
You mean Tina,
whose robot daughter

902
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,291
almost didn't make sectionals
because of you?

903
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,262
Typical Tina Harwood.

904
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,459
Just like Sarajevo.

905
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:22,662
You don't know anything, do you?

906
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,865
They kicked her out.

907
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:29,978
You might wanna reconsider
that no-coach thing.

908
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:34,545
Bye, new girl.

909
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,484
- [Tina] Meet at the van in 40 minutes.
- [woman] Okay, sure thing.

910
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,381
There she is.

911
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,359
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

912
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:48,988
- You were awesome.
- l am so happy that it's over.

913
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,936
- Are you happy about my feet?
- What?

914
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,995
l'm sorry, Casey,
but your old skates were a mess.

915
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,508
You bought her new skates?

916
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,636
Please, like you didn't know.

917
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:07,342
- Casey, l didn't!
- How can you lie to my face?

918
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,782
You're just as bad as she is.

919
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:13,447
- Hey, ease up, Casey.
- Oh, just defend her!

920
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,285
Like you weren't part of it.

921
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:19,417
- How could you think that?
- Because it's true.

922
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:24,364
You set me up. All of you.

923
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,799
What kind of people are you?

924
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,943
Come on, let's go.

925
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,912
Mom?

926
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,782
Can you come and get me?

927
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:50,492
l'm at the skating rink at Westerly.

928
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,588
l want to come home.

929
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:10,640
Honey, get in the car.
Just get in the car, honey.

930
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:14,376
- How dare you?
- Just hang on, kids.

931
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:18,147
You think you can just waltz away
after injuring my daughter?

932
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,245
lt's Joan, right?

933
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:23,190
Pulling her away from her studies
behind my back?

934
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:28,925
Filling her head with a fantasy that she
can skate and sabotaging her chances?

935
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,934
l did you a favor. You didn't want this
for Casey and you're right.

936
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,003
She's not cut out for it.

937
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,938
ls she gifted? l'll give her that.

938
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:41,568
But Casey won't fight for it.
She's too polite to do what you have to.

939
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:45,670
To push past everyone and everything
and just take it.

940
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:51,015
So that's the example
you set for your daughter.

941
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,988
To lie and to sneak around
and to cheat.

942
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:04,357
l made my daughter strong, and you made
Casey at home in a lecture hall.

943
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:08,392
And she'll do very well there.
So you see, we agree.

944
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:13,498
My daughter's brilliant and will
succeed at whatever she does.

945
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,873
But she will do it the right way

946
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:20,279
despite people like you
trying to convince her otherwise.

947
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,351
Casey!

948
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:09,255
- l'm in shape. l can keep up with you.
- Go away.

949
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,391
- Casey, l didn't know!
- Right!

950
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:21,606
Where have you been? You are aware
you had practice half an hour ago?

951
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,942
- Yes, l'm aware.
- And?

952
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,277
And l'm done.

953
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,851
Done?

954
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:42,087
l'm quitting.

955
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:45,429
You've got to be kidding.
That's ridiculous.

956
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:49,938
No, l was ridiculous for putting myself
through this for so long.

957
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,031
We both know l don't have the talent.

958
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:56,010
Perseverance is nine tenths
of mastering any sport.

959
01:06:56,178 --> 01:07:00,808
Do you know what l want?
No, you don't know what l want.

960
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:02,976
Because you never cared.

961
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:10,849
lf you have any sense
of self preservation, you'll scatter.

962
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,955
[muttering]

963
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:23,336
- l'm listening.
- l wanna stop missing school.

964
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,033
l like school.

965
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:28,941
You know, it's stupid
and the band will probably be horrible,

966
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:33,209
but l wanna go
to the homecoming dance.

967
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,045
And l wanna go with Brian.

968
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:40,578
l want to stop feeling an idiot
for flunking math

969
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,850
because l don't have time to learn it.

970
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,918
- And l want...
- All right. All right.

971
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:52,262
- l can see maybe we've overdone it.
- Overdone it?

972
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:56,397
Just a little.

973
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,736
Casey's skates, Mom.

974
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,675
[bell]

975
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:08,415
We'll continue this discussion at home.

976
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:34,199
- You heard the whole thing?
- Yeah.

977
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,142
Are you okay?

978
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:47,588
lt's your slot, Casey.
lf l drop out, you're next.

979
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,784
You'll go to sectionals.

980
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,522
No.

981
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:58,961
Thanks.
Tomorrow's my Harvard interview.

982
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:02,834
That's my slot.
That's what l should be doing.

983
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:05,133
You sure about that?

984
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,177
lt's a nice little experiment.

985
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:23,483
How does a triple loop jump
entitle you to a physics scholarship?

986
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:30,624
The proof of the experiment isn't in
the mumbo jumbo of the calculations.

987
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:35,727
lt's in the improvement in the skating
of three junior champions.

988
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:41,335
l also applied the findings
to my own skating and...

989
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:49,041
...and actually managed
to implement the experiment

990
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:54,589
in a very rewarding
and entirely personal way.

991
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,022
Well, good,

992
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:59,686
because passion is a key component
of what we look for in students.

993
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:03,253
Passion makes people
go on to do exceptional things.

994
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:09,270
So, Casey,
why are you passionate about Harvard?

995
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,011
Dr. Healey,

996
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:30,184
my mom and l have been imagining
Harvard practically my whole life.

997
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:38,190
l can't believe l'm saying this,
but what l need to be doing,

998
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,598
l can't do here.

999
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,703
l'm sorry l've wasted your time.

1000
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,136
l'm so sorry.

1001
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:59,752
Miss Carlyle, we won't reschedule.

1002
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,115
l know.

1003
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:20,933
You can't do this, Case.
You're giving up your dream.

1004
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:25,071
No, Mom,
l'm giving up your dream.

1005
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,843
l'm going after mine.

1006
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,113
[shrieks]

1007
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:49,361
- How did you know?
- Didn't think you'd give up.

1008
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:52,628
Which meant you'd be out here
bumping it out.

1009
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:57,570
Teddy, l've been trying to find
some way to apologize.

1010
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:00,642
l've got some ideas about that.

1011
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,234
Medium smooth or glassy?

1012
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:54,522
l can't have a conversation with anybody
l haven't known since kindergarten,

1013
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:57,588
so how come l can do that
in front of you?

1014
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:01,998
Because you let people see you
when you skate.

1015
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:09,138
But, Casey,
you can't win going it alone.

1016
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:11,405
You're gonna need some help.

1017
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,754
[doorbell]

1018
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:41,973
- What do you want?
- Five minutes.

1019
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,538
You owe me that much.

1020
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:55,020
lf you're here for an apology,
you won't get one.

1021
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,524
l'm not here for an apology.

1022
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:00,118
Tell me what happened in Sarajevo.

1023
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,355
Why didn't you win?

1024
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,862
l had an unfortunate warm-up
before my short program.

1025
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:13,374
l collided with another skater
and she got hurt.

1026
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,035
Are you sorry?

1027
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:23,384
Look, l paid my dues.
l was suspended.

1028
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:28,445
By the time they considered reinstating
me, l was 26 and it was too late.

1029
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:34,553
But there isn't a day goes by that
l don't wish l could relive that moment

1030
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,098
and do it differently.

1031
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,800

1032
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,074
Why on earth would l do that?

1033
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:56,015
Because you don't have a skater
and l don't have a coach.

1034
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:59,576
- We're a perfect match.
- l don't think you have what it takes.

1035
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:05,324
Tina, l have to do this.

1036
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,952

l've ever wanted anything.

1037
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,057

1038
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,894
l will work harder than
any skater you have ever trained.

1039
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,735
And if l fail, l fail,

1040
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:23,744
but because l wasn't good enough,
not because l didn't have the guts.

1041
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:29,546
l want to know what l can do in
this sport, and l'm going to find out.

1044
01:16:56,745 --> 01:17:02,081
That you'd even consider
letting that woman back into your head!

1045
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,414
l don't have to like her or trust her.

1046
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:07,353
No, you just wanna
spend all your time with her.

1047
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,983
- l'm not gonna turn into her.
- She's already rubbed off on you.

1048
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,492
That's not true.

1049
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:15,722
Where did this hair come from?
And the make-up and shirt?

1050
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,163
l did not buy you that shirt.

1051
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,131
That has nothing to do with it.

1052
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:24,605

and if you happen to lie now and again,

1053

1054

lt is a thrilling and beautiful sport.

1056

just make you feel beautiful?

1057
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,318
So what if it does?

1058
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,448
What is so horrible about that?

1059
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:47,722
About feeling strong and graceful
and beautiful for once in my life?

1060
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:55,436
Why are you jealous of her?

1061
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,303
Well, l guess no matter how old we get,

1062
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:03,242

always hate the prom queen.

1192
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:48,515
[Michelle] High! 5.1 s and 5.2s.

1193
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:51,848
They're almost dead even
with Nikki Fletcher's.

1194
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:54,547
That's my daughter.
That's my daughter.

1195
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,920
[Brian]
Here's her artistic set of marks.

1196
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:59,084
Hold on. Hold on.

1197
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:04,053
[Brian]
Those are almost even with Nikki's.

1198
01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:10,095
[Brian] Did she do it?

1199
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:13,004
No, it's not enough.
She'll have to settle for silver.

1200
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:17,807
This takes her to nationals and
who knows, maybe the 2006 Olympics.

1201
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:20,404
With this skater,
anything is possible.

1202
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,150
Thank you.

1203
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:30,614
[Joan] Case?

1204
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:36,026
Mom?

1205
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:42,929
lf l'd known.
lf l'd just taken ten minutes

1206
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:45,267
and gone to the rink with you,

1207
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:48,536
l never would have...

1208
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,440
Mom.

1209
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:53,209
l'm sorry.

1210
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:56,244
l'm so sorry.

1211
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,920
How could l not see?

1212
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,715
You see me better than anybody.

1213
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:16,895
Come on.

1214
01:31:38,893 --> 01:31:40,827
Casey.

1215
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,999
Congratulations.

1216
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:49,934
And you can drive the Zamboni
any time you want.

1217
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:08,846
l was this close, this close to losing!

1218
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:12,187
- Where did those triples come from?!
- Sweetheart, you...

1219
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:15,593
Don't you know what'll happen
after six months with Tina?

1220
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:18,564
- What?
- She's gonna whip my butt!

1221
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:24,137
- Someone is gonna pay big time.
- Nikki. Can we have a word?

1222
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:27,299
- Hello, Peter.
- Just wanted to say congrats.

1223
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:31,277
We look forward to seeing The
Jumping Shrimp at the Nationals.

1224
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:35,907
That is so sweet. l just went out there
and skated my best.

1225
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:39,976
And today,
l guess my best was good enough.

1226
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:43,521
- Love you.
- [squeak]

1227
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:50,661
You know l can't afford this.
We'll need to find a sponsor.

1228
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,961
l'm on it.
Burger Blast is interested.

1229
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:57,733
Burger Blast?
Oh no, l am sorry. l'm sorry, no.

1230
01:32:57,838 --> 01:32:58,862
Why not?

1231
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:01,567
lf she can't eat it,
she can't endorse it.

1232
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:05,476
We'll need something healthier.
How about Grape-Nuts?

1233
01:33:05,546 --> 01:33:08,447
Grape-Nuts?
What about cod liver oil?

1234
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:11,007
- Guys.
- You know, l am her mother.

1235
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:13,053
What l say goes.
She is my daughter.

1236
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,180
- She is my skater.
- Well, daughter trumps skater.

1237
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:21,092
Well, ask any professional athlete,
coach trumps mother every time.

1238
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:23,322
Guys!

1239
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:29,863
And that boy,
we'll need to nip that in the bud.

1240
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:32,167
l can't go through all this
and a boy too.

1241
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,969
That is a huge distraction.
lt's unacceptable.

1242
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:38,603
- l don't believe this!
- You will be busy training.

1243
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:40,647
And four college courses.

1244
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:44,707
Four? Are you out of your mind,
with everything she's doing?

1245
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:46,753
All right, two.

1246
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:50,255
- But then four in the fall.
- Only if she wins sectionals.

1247
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:52,485
Oh, she will.

1248

01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:33,223
