[siren whooping]

00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,718
-Hey, what's up?
-Whatever you need, I got it.

3
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,387
The [bleep]?

00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:35,663
[car idling]

00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,509

[muffled yelling]

00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,293
[muffled yelling]

8
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,101
With drugs and crime
at an all-time high,

9
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:50,404
our streets look like
a Third World nation.

10
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,906
Every neighborhood and corner

11
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,841
has been infested
with bad people

12
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,077
who will do anything
to take what they want

13
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,013
forcing law-abiding,
goodhearted citizens

14
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,515
to live in fear every day.

15
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,316
As your district attorney,
I have worked tirelessly

16
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,752
to clean up our streets,

17
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,754
and I promise I will
continue to do so

18
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,624
if re-elected this November

19
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,793
because we all deserve better

20
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:14,829
if we follow the law.

21
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,330
I'm Glen Garrey,
and I approve this message.

22
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,567
Get away!

23
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,706
I'm the luckiest guy around.

24
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,440
Truly a dream come true.

25
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,475
We're actually expecting,
so it's a bit of a rush

26
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,011
to the altar before she pops.

27
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,344
Ah, what are you expecting?

28
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,780
-A baby.
-Aw.

29
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,281
She actually proposed to me

30
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,817
with the pregnancy test.

31
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,152
Both at the same time, it was--

32
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,955
My whole life changed
in one moment.

33
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,124
Speaking of, we have
a pretty busy day ahead,

34
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,459
-so if we could just--
-There's this things about

35
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,961
her eyes, they're just so

36
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,462
-welcoming.
-Could we

37
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,564
-go back to--
-Whose eyes

38
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:50,898
should the baby have?

39
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,067
Hers, right?

40
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,367
-Right.
-They're just the best eyes.

41
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,738
Uh, also it's your
sister's big birthday.

42
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,539
Oh, no, I don't have a sister.

43
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,909
Well, sister-in-law, my sister.

44
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,745
It's his sister-in-law,
my sister's birthday,

45
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:04,879
-so--
-It is?

46
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,881
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I told you.

47
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,984
You were eating corn, or--
I don't remember what happened.

48
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,920
-Yeah, corn's loud.
-Well, of course.

49
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,756
This will only take
a moment of your time.

50
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,191
Now, you see we have
many different plans,

51
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:19,160
all great value,
but the Platinum

52
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,863
is the most popular
and most comprehensive.

53
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:22,930
[kettle whistling]

54
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,198
Oh, no!

55
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:25,700
Allow me.

56
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,334
Oh, thank you.

57
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,841
[tapping on aquarium]

58
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,547
Do they ever eat each other?

59
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,882
Sorry?

60
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,518
Seems like they would
being cooped up and all.

61
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,953
No, they would never
eat each other.

62
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:47,588
Not unless you
gave them a reason to...

63
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,557
in which case
you would be covered

64
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,193
under our Tails and Scales plan
should you elect it.

65
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,230
You're the breadwinner
here, correct?

66
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:59,432
Uh, I don't know
what that matters.

67
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,301
You're young,
you're newly married.

68
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,870
Mazel tov, by the way.

69
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:04,272
Oh, thank you.

70
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,306
But while it might
feel like you have

71
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,976
your whole lives ahead of you,
the reality is...

72
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,279
you don't.

73
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,882
And what are you gonna do
when he's gone, Mark?

74
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,383
You have to survive somehow.

75
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,653
I think I can handle--

76
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,722
excuse me--uh, the cups
are up and to the right.

77
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,124
Imagine this scenario.

78
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,159
You wake up one morning,

79
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:27,795
you roll over to give
your lovely husband a kiss

80
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,631
same as you always do,
but this time

81
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,567
that kiss lands on
ice-cold cheeks.

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,235
[gasps lightly]

83
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,170
Or, you're leaving
work for the night,

84
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,072
you're walking through
the dark parking lot,

85
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,439
-bam!
-Ah!

86
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,808
You've just been
shot in the stomach

87
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,144
by some druggie lowlife

88
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,313
lookin' to score
their next high,

89
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,081
leaving you to
bleed out and die.

90
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,583
Bam!

91
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,651
Now Mark's all alone,

92
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,620
left to grow old all by himself.

93
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,689
[beating table]

94
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,792
Nobody to take care of him,

95
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,895
and nobody left to feed him.

96
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,465
Tea bags?

97
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,101
Oh, yeah, um,

third drawer on the left.

99
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,274
We'll get Tails and Scales
just to be on the safe--

100
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,009
-Thank you for being honest.
-Yeah, I mean,

101
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,344
we're gonna have to
figure something out.

102
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,678
There's nothing
that you're good at,

103
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,647
so we just, we should
probably protect you

104
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,148
-just in case, you know.
-Now, as I was saying,

105
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,351
we have three levels
of life insurance,

106
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,687
but only the Platinum plan
covers everything from

107
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,890
normal death
to accidental suicide,

108
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:31,993
even mysterious disappearance.

109
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,061
Now, the most
important thing in life

110
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:35,830
is that we protect
the ones we love.

111
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,300
But, we cannot do that unless
we take care of ourselves first.

112
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,635
We'll go with
the Platinum package.

113
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,737
-Mm-hmm.
-Ha! Fantastic!

114
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,581
Hey, so,
so you know, as you know,

115
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,017
Carrie's due in a few months.

116
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,518
You know that.

117
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,655
We've been doing a lot
of planning for the baby,

118
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,356
which has been pretty intense.

119
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,091
We're arguing about
the baby room,

120
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,360
and she wants
gender neutral colors,

121
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:09,196
I want gender inclusive colors,
which is just silly

122
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,265
because colors
can't have a gender, you know,

123
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:12,900
they're not having
sex with each other--

124
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,269
unless you count when colors
mix and make another color,

125
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:17,038
like blue and yellow make green.

126
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,706
When there's that case,
then blue is dad,

127
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,408
yellow's mom, obviously. But...

128
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,246
What I'm trying to say is,
Sonny,

129
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,416
will you be my kid's godfather?

130
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,053
Godfather?

131
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:33,621
It's really just a title

132
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,690
to show how important
you are to me.

133
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:39,527
I don't even know the kid,
and you're askin' me to what?

134
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,362
I mean, you and Carrie
are the closest thing

135
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,530
I ever had to family.

136
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,965
Noah, we're co-workers.

137
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,766
That's all.

138
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,809
Let's just put a pin in it.

139
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,711
-Okay?
-Yeah? Great!

140
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,546
Put all the pins you need.

141
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,448
I'll send you an email.
I'll remind you tomorrow.

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,717
Ah, it's the red coats.

143
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,220
I hope you paid for those
burgers because that BMW

144
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,989
does not run on free meals.

145
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:09,290
Show him the receipt.

146
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,430
Listen, we'd love to
stay and chat, Pops,

147
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:18,265
but we really need
to get back to work.

148
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,600
Ah, yes,

149
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,636
the high stakes world
of insurance sales.

150
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,005
How's all that going anyway?

151
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:25,473
Great, actually.

152
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,141
We hold the best sales
record in the office.

153
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,744
"We," so how are you the best

154
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:32,446
if "we" are tied
for first place?

155
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,981
I think you're missing
the point here.

156
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,649
It seems to me
you're saying that there are

157
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,251
two of you in first place.

158
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,919
That's what he's saying,
right, Nathan?

159
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,354
Uh, it's Noah.

160
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:42,523
-What?
-Yes, we're partners.

161
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,925
What I'm saying is I think
most parents would be proud.

162
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,227
Proud of what?

163
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,932
Your, your five-figure salary
and your, your split commission?

164
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,701
I would be ashamed

165
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,703
to admit that I made
that little of money,

166
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,639
but clearly bringing shame
to your family's reputation

167
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,375
doesn't seem to bother you
all that much, does it, son?

168
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,813
Come on, Noah.

169
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,782
-So sad.
-Bye, Mr. Reddy.

170
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,450
This was awesome.
I never had a dad, so--

171
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,352
Noah, chop, chop!

172
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,189
Sorry.

173
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,858
Just move around him,
just push past him!

174
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,126
-Go right.
-Oh, my God,

175
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,661
where would you like to go, son?

176
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:21,796
-Sorry.
-Thanks for eating

177
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:22,897
at Faithful Cow!

178
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,565
Your business is sacred to us!

179
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,709
[water running]

180
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,778
[scrubbing]

181
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,649
[mop wiping]

182
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,914
Ah, hey, Lucas.

183
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,384
Phil.

184
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,594
It's been six months
since he went missing.

185
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,728
Everyone, including the police,

186
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,264
are telling me to accept
that my husband's dead.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,635
And, and I have.

188
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,471
Hell, we had a service
for him last week!

189
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,406
Look, we have
a system here, ma'am,

190
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,075
and it's our job to maintain it.

191
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,244
But everything is processed

192
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,580
thoroughly and fairly,
your claim included.

193
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:48,149
What-what does that mean,
exactly?

194
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:51,152
It means that
in the eyes of insurance,

195
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,587
your husband is still alive!

196
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,055
Hey, that's kind
of exciting, right?

197
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,993
Sure,

198
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,462
except for the fact that
he's not still alive.

199
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,030
Well, you can't prove that.

200
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,734
Prove it?

201
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,235
People try to cheat the system,

202
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,572
so it's our job to be vigilant

203
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:11,939
in this situation.

204
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,909
But if your husband
is actually missing,

205
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,344
then we can only assume
that's all there is to it.

206
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:21,115
And until he's proven dead,
his breathing ceased,

207
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,950
his mind unable to ponder

208
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,386
the questions of the life
he's no longer living,

209
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,689
then we can't pay out
his life insurance policy.

210
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,325
See, had you elected
the Platinum plan,

211
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:34,028
this wouldn't have
even been an issue.

212
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:36,964
There's a silver lining, though.

213
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,033
Your husband might
actually be dead,

214
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,801
and if his body is recovered,

215
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,671
then your claim
will be rewarded.

216
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,207
So, I could
still get that money?

217
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:50,211
So long as you continue
to pay out the policy.

218
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,847
Hi, I'm Paula Caste,

219
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,149
and at Caste Insurance,

220
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,718
we understand
the importance of family,

221
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,689
which is why we're here
to provide peace of mind.

222
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,290
Peace of mind that
it's not the end of the world

223
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,694
when your son wrecks
the family van.

224
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,495
Peace of mind that
mom is still mom,

225
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,998
even when she has
her identity stolen.

226
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:14,902
Peace of mind
that despite your dad's
pre-existing condition,

227
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,472
we will still cover
that open heart surgery.

228
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:21,742
Dad! What's wrong?
Dad, are you okay?

229
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,579
Don't worry,
they have Caste Insurance,

230
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:27,248
where your life is our life.

231
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,415
Dad, wake up!

232
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:29,883
Don't you dare leave me!

233
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,319
Dad, wake up!

234
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:37,224
Okay, one more expense
that I have a question about,

235
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,660
and this is big,

236
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:42,697
a $100,000 deposit
to Yacht Brokers.

237
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,398
Uh-huh.

238
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,635
So, you confirm
that expense, then?

239
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,238
Yeah, it's a business expense.

240
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,675
Is it? Because I'm not
so sure I can do much more

241
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,009
to cook these numbers, Paula.

242
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,511
It would be one thing
if we were just

243
00:12:56,544 --> 00:13:00,414
-dipping into reserves--
-Brent, I'm a CEO.

244
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,183
CEOs have boats,
end of discussion.

245
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:05,219
-Please, don't--
-Oh, don't worry,

246
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:08,055
I'll make it work on my end
just make it work on yours!

247
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:11,458
-Jesus Christ [bleep] Almighty!
-Okay, okay, we just

248
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:12,860
talked about this.

249
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,896
Paula and I split
commission my whole career.

250
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,931
I'm not settling!

251
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,534
Why do you say that?

252
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,969
That's not what I'm doing!
I'm making something of myself.

253
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,437
-Sonny.
-Paula!

254
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,872
-Noah.
-Hey,

255
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,642
not sure if you saw
my request for paternity leave--

256
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:30,377
I didn't realize
you were the one giving birth.

257
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:32,547
Trust me, if I could,
I would give birth.

258
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,683
It's been a true blessing.

259
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,788
Okay, so I guess I'll check
back with you in a few weeks

260
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,221
'cause Carrie's really
about to pop,

261
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,823
-and I'd like to know...
-Yeah, okay, look, look,

262
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,325
-I gotta go, all right.
-...before the baby gets here.

263
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,860
I'll do better and be better,
okay, bye, Pop.

264
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,964
-Really crucial time--
-Some clients just

265
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,099
talk your ear off.

266
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,934
Meet me in my office now.

267
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,603
Yeah, okay.

268
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,344
Have you ever had
a $200 cup of sake before?

269
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:04,779
You know, I can't say I have.

270
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:07,915
I'd like to propose
a toast, Sonny,

271
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,450
a toast to my future

272
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,885
-VP of sales.
-Paula, that's fantastic.

273
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,120
You're makin' a great decision.

274
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,489
-Cheers!
-Eh, eh, eh, hey!

275
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:18,025
Don't drink it. Spit it back
in the cup, all of it.

276
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,927
Wipe it off your fingers,
put it in the cup.

277
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,929
I am simply saying

278
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:25,265
that you could be my future
VP of sales, that's it.

279
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,968
Sure, sure, and "could be"
means highly probable.

280
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,506
Perhaps, but you need to
get your sales numbers up.

281
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,675
[computer chiming]

282
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,145
Let me be clear, Sonny.

283
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,947
I don't need you
just to give me more,

284
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,550
I need you to give me
everything you've got.

285
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:45,119
Your sales need
to double this quarter.

286
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,354
Double? Paula,
that's not possible.

287
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,957
Well, perhaps Noah
would think it's possible.

288
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,861
For the first time, I have
everything I could possibly need

289
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,029
with my family and friends
like Sonny by my side.

290
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,031
Whoa, okay, hey, all I meant was

291
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,033
double's not possible
with Noah weighing me down.

292
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,370
I look in the mirror and I still
see that boy from Claremont...

293
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:05,072
-Sure.
-...bouncin' around from

294
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,040
-foster home to foster home.
-Yeah.

295
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,743
Of course.

296
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,411
And people like Noah,

297
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,346
they don't seem to have
that gusto it takes

298
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,081
to really excel in the world.

299
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,750
I kept hope alive,

300
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:16,984
and I always kept

301
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,686
-love in my heart.
-Right.

302
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,755
While people like us,

303
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,222
we're sharks,

304
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,726
and we will do whatever
it takes to survive.

305
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,260
Absolutely,
you know what, Paula,

306
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,228
I've always felt that
we're on the same level.

307
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,364
[laughing]

308
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,433
My goodness.

309
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,769
And this is me
laughing for genuine.

310
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:36,571
[laughing]

311
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,873
You think we're on
the same level.

312
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:41,709
I'm your boss,
and I'm also a great white.

313
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,878
I could chew you up
and spit you out

314
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:45,513
as if it's nothing at all.

315
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:47,582
I could give you
the world's rarest,

316
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,751
most exquisite cup of sake,

317
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:52,854
and then I could
take it away from you.

318
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,923
[sake pouring]

319
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,893
So unless you get your sales
numbers where I need them to be,

320
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,695
I may have to rethink
your employment

321
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,296
here at Caste all together.

322
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,934
And don't think for a second
that your tarnished reputation

323
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,069
won't follow you
wherever you go.

324
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,972
Without me,
you're just another nobody

325
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,709
with nothin' to show for it.

326
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:15,976
Understand?

327
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,615
Great, now get out there

328
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:22,951
and sell the people
what they need.

329
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,060
Ah, Wendy, tell me,

330
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:36,296
have you ever had
a $200 cup of sake before?

331
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,157
[doorbell dinging]

332
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,494
[dog barking distantly]

333
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,204
[cart rattling]

334
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,381
While the poll numbers
are extremely close,

335
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,551
District Attorney,
Glen Garrey remains confident

336
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:04,686
in his re-election.

337
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,186
His Sweep the Streets campaign,

338
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,421
calling for stricter sentencing

339
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,524
on drug-related,
non-violent offences,

340
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,893
along with his well-known
tragic family story

341
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:13,962
has emboldened his base
to the point--

342
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,073
I already have life insurance.

343
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,708
I just don't see
why I would need

344
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:29,043
accidental death insurance

345
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:30,511
on top of it?

346
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,013
As I mentioned earlier,

347
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,581
they're just not the same thing.

348
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,215
You know, why don't
we just go ahead

349
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,619
and get you set up
with the Basic package

350
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:39,887
just for starters.

351
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,789
You can always upgrade.

352
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:45,693
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I'm just not interested.

353
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,563
It's not a problem
because you can cancel

354
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:49,731
-at any time.
-Oh,

355
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:51,966
I think I'll cancel now.

356
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,075
What Sonny means to say is

357
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,442
we can't help you
if you don't let us.

358
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,712
Noah, let's walk away now, okay?

359
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,047
We don't have time for this.

360
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:09,751
I'm sorry if I offended you!

361
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:10,952
Not at all, Mrs. Kennedy.

362
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:12,654
You have a good
rest of your day now.

363
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,828
Hey, is everything cool?

364
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:22,396
No, we needed that sale.

365
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:24,132
No stress,
we'll get the next one.

366
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,900
Besides, our numbers
are impeccable.

367
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,434
No, they're not!

368
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,504
And even if they were,
that's still not good enough.

369
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,906
Hey, we're on
the same team, bud.

370
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,574
I don't need you
on my team, okay?

371
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,109
I just need you to step it up.

372
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:37,111
You're not the only one
with family pressure.

373
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:39,179
[cars crashing]

374
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:44,052
[car trying to start]

375
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,927
Come on, man!

376
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,028
You gotta watch
where you're going.

377
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,263
-You came outta nowhere!
-Sorry.

378
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,633
-What? I can't hear you.
-I'm sorry.

379
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,968
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't
fix my bumper, does it?

380
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,036
Are you hurt, sir?

381
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,771
Try not to overexert your spine,

382
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:06,040
but if you could reach
your insurance information,

383
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,442
we could work
this out, no problem!

384
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:11,946
Hey, you awake in there?

385
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,549
I need your insurance info!

386
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:15,717
I don't have insurance.

387
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,821
-Really? No insurance.
-If you don't have insurance,

388
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,656
we can help you with that.

389
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:23,191
[car turns over]

390
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,027
Hey! Hey!
What they hell are you doing?

391
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,162
Sir! Come back here!

392
00:20:28,196 --> 00:20:29,831
Sir, we sell insurance!

393
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:37,772
Hey!

394
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,209
Hey, you can't just
hit and run like that!

395
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,177
-Sir!
-We're just tryin' to help.

396
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,049
Hey, listen, I'm not mad,

397
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,550
and you're not in trouble.

398
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,219
I just need your
insurance information.

399
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,521
-I told you, I don't--
-You don't have insurance,

400
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,656
which is why I'm willing
to forget about the accident

401
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,257
if I can just have
a minute of your time

402
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,926
to discuss your options.

403
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,095
You see, today's
your lucky day because

404
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,396
we could set you up
with a custom package

405
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,365
with rates as low
as $10 a month.

406
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,868
In fact, if you're interested,

407
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,336
we don't just have auto plans,
we can also set you up

408
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,839
with home, life,
and health insurance.

409
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:15,243
Bottom line, we have
your best interest in mind.

410
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,546
'Cause at Caste Insurance,
your life is our life.

411
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:21,783
-You need to leave.
-I promise,

412
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:24,417
this will be a lot quicker
than calling the police.

413
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,427
Wow, thanks, that was fast.

414
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:37,497
Beautiful home you have here.

415
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,568
Yeah, but you know
with an older home like this...

416
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,136
[stomping]

417
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,038
...really should
consider homeowner's.

418
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:46,908
And, to be clear, flood isn't
covered under homeowner's,

419
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,910
so with the climate
changing at this rate,

420
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:50,377
you really can't be too safe.

421
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,580
You would be shocked at
how little water it takes

422
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:53,981
to destroy a home's foundation.

423
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:56,383
Even a minor leak
can do real damage.

424
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,819
Yeah, you know what,
in fact, let's go take

425
00:21:57,852 --> 00:21:59,821
-a look at that basement.
-No.

426
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:01,321
You have a lot of
older pets in here?

427
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:02,757
Pets are a part
of the family, too,

428
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,292
and you wanna make sure
you protect 'em.

429
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,294
Which is covered under
our Paws and Claws package.

430
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,529
The basement's gotta be
around here somewhere, right?

431
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:13,968
[jiggling door handle]

432
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,806
You really have
this place on lockdown.

433
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,675
Privacy is important,
which is why we offer

434
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,809
identify theft protection.

435
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,443
Yeah, you never can be too safe.

436
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,679
You need to leave now.

437
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:26,247
Ah-ha, here we go!

438
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,851
-Thank you.
-That mildew smell, which--

439
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:34,655
Well, well,
we have guests I see.

440
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:37,925
It was a mistake.

441
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,660
They're not like the others.

442
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:40,761
[laughing]

443
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,495
That's no matter, sweetie.

444
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,031
They're under our roof now.

445
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:47,168
We mustn't treat them any
differently than the others.

446
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,805
After all, there is
an order in this house,

447
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:53,708
and we must do all we can
to maintain it.

448
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:06,854
'Bout a five-foot.

449
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:08,122
Okay.

450
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,391
Now you see, basement
with exposed piping

451
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,794
is always a nightmare
when it comes to flooding.

452
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:16,330
We're talking thousands
of dollars of damage here.

453
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:17,665
You need to listen.

454
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,367
-Oh, no.
-What?

455
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,702
Oh, my!

456
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,639
This is a huge problem,
catastrophic even.

457
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,674
I mean, this bathroom may
as well be a hydrogen bomb.

458
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,376
Bathrooms are
the leading culprit

459
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,077
when it comes to water damage.

460
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:31,812
Hey, have you heard the one
about the two hydrogens

461
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:32,914
who walked into a bar?

462
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,248
No, thank you.

463
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,983
Oh, no, you're gonna
wanna hear this one.

464
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:37,417
They got so drunk

465
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,686
they needed some oxygen.

466
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,521
[laughing]

467
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:44,058
Get it?
Two hydrogens, an oxygen?

468
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,660
It's a water joke.

469
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,662
But, water is no joke,

470
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:50,031
so let's get you set--
I'm sorry, I don't

471
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:51,999
-think we got your name.
-Lucas.

472
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,869
Lucas, I'm Noah,
nice to formally meet you.

473
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,737
This is Sonny, my best friend.

474
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:59,340
-Co-worker.
-Co-worker turned best friend.

475
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:00,875
Not really relevant right now.

476
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:02,777
Just so he understands
our dynamic, now you know.

477
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,513
Yeah, so how 'bout we take
this conversation upstairs

478
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,182
-before Mt. Vesuvius blows?
-That's not what Grandma wants.

479
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:12,452
You live with your grandma?
Does she have life insurance?

480
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,288
Because I know it's a tough
thing to think about,

481
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,390
but it's something
we all need to plan for,

482
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:17,792
and I'm sure Grandma
would understand.

483
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,527
We could explain
everything to her in full.

484
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,695
She's in her room.

485
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,462
So go get her.

486
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:23,998
I'm not allowed in her room.

487
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,767
Okay, well then she's gonna
have to come down here because

488
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:29,103
after all, life insurance
is something for her

489
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,604
-to decide.
-Enough!

490
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:34,642
I'm sorry,

491
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,311
but Grandma will
not speak to you.

492
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:41,048
Not a problem.
Just the auto and flood then.

493
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:43,417
I'm gonna go get that paperwork,
and I'll be right back.

494
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,464
Must be nice to live
with Grandma.

495
00:24:58,466 --> 00:24:59,967
[door rattling]

496
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,068
What the--?

497
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:02,670
You need a key.

498
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:04,638
Hey, look, you need
to unlock the door

499
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:06,240
so we can finalize your policy.

500
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,508
We can't help you
if you don't let us.

501
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:08,976
No one can help you now.

502
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,411
Exactly.

503
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:11,946
-Wait, what?
-Sir, we're trying to offer you

504
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:14,415
-a way out of this situation.
-There is no way out,

505
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,851
and I'm not buying
your insurance.

506
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:23,424
What is it with the people
in this neighborhood, huh?

507
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:24,792
None of you can
see value when it's

508
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,794
-right in front of you?
-Sonny, cool it.

509
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:29,430
No, you know what,
I'm not cooling it,

510
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:31,999
okay, because this
guy hits my car,

511
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,667
tries to run off,

512
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:35,236
and then he doesn't
have the decency

513
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:36,737
to buy insurance from me.
[scoffs]

514
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:41,208
Well, then you will be
hearing from my lawyers, okay?

515
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:42,443
Give me those keys! Argh!

516
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:44,378
Let go of him!

517
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:49,350
You know what, [bleep] you,
let us the [bleep] out!

518
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,485
Hey, maybe there's
a better way to handle this.

519
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,787
Yeah, there is.

520
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,321
[grunting]

521
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:55,524
Hey, you're gonna break his arm!

522
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,725
[groaning]

523
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:02,897
You're makin' a big mistake.

524
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,534
[groaning]

525
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,503
Ah, no, no, let go, let go!

526
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:09,637
Let go, no!

527
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,838
No, no!

528
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:15,109
Sir, please, we're on your side.

529
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,880
You don't have to buy
the insurance, we will go.

530
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,086
You [bleep]!

531
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,420
I'm sorry.

532
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:28,557
We offer other plans!

533
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,058
You're messin'
with the wrong guy!

534
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:32,226
We're sorry!

535
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,628
You are messing
with the wrong guy!

536
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,748
Are they contained?

537
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,645
Well, do what you must to

538
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,447
get them fully settled in, hm?

539
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,150
-Yes, ma'am.
-And, Lucas, please

540
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:30,885
fix your shirt.

541
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,386
We don't want someone
thinking that

542
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:33,954
you're some kind of lowlife.

543
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,384
[keypad beeping]

544
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:15,664
[groaning]

545
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,198
You gonna just
stand there? Come on!

546
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:19,033
I have weak bones,
you know that!

547
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:21,702
[door opening]

548
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,939
[chains rattling]

549
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:26,608
Okay, hey, listen, you need to--

550
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,175
[electricity popping]

551
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,645
Empty your pockets.

552
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:31,712
[sighing]

553
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:35,883
That's what you want, cash, huh?

554
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,821
-Jackets.
-Oh, [bleep] you.

555
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:42,122
[electricity popping]

556
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,559
Grandma has
an order to maintain.

557
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:47,261
The sooner you accept that,
the more comfortable you'll be.

558
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:51,465
It's nothing personal.

559
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:59,507
Yeah, well, it feels
kinda personal, [bleep]!

560
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:06,681
[insects chirping]

561
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:09,283
[utensils clinking]

562
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,327
You're distant, Lucas.

563
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:25,634
You shouldn't be
doing this to them.

564
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,337
They're not bad people.

565
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:36,076
Don't concern yourself with
who they may or may not be.

566
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:38,912
All that matters
is our survival.

567
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:40,749
But the code.

568
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:44,184
The code is what
we make it, Lucas.

569
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:47,955
It's merely meant
to ensure our prosperity

570
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:51,626
just as it did for my parents
when they ran this house,

571
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,460
and their parents before them.

572
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:56,598
Doesn't feel right, Grandma.

573
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:58,633
A person guided by feelings

574
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,968
is a person too weak to survive.

575
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:05,406
Your mother was too weak
to survive.

576
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,844
Come, my dear.

577
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,960
[plate sliding]

578
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:35,730
You need to eat.

579
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:39,032
[breathing heavily]

580
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:44,338
This is worse than the time
I dropped

581
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:46,741
my phone in the toilet
before a flight.

582
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,208
I was so nervous
that I wouldn't be able to

583
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,244
keep in touch with Carrie
that I left the airport

584
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:52,379
and rushed all the way home
because I didn't want her

585
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,415
to think I was maybe
raped or murdered.

586
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:57,084
I swear, if this
lunatic gets me fired,

587
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:58,919
I will kill him.

588
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:01,922
Hey, I don't know
if we should call him a lunatic.

589
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:05,259
Sure, psychopath
is more fitting.

590
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,728
Yeah, well,

591
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:09,697
we're all a product
of our environment.

592
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:11,666
We don't know what
he's been through.

593
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:14,034
What he's been through?

594
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,203
We're locked in his
[bleep] basement, Noah.

595
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:17,772
Point is...

596
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:19,808
no one's crazy for no reason.

597
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,796
Two local insurance salesmen

598
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,431
who were reported missing
one week ago today

599
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:46,568
are tragically found dead

600
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:49,470
in what appears to be
a grizzly double homicide,

601
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:51,606
sparking District
Attorney Glen Garrey

602
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:53,808
to call for an emergency
press conference

603
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:56,711
to address the recent string
of criminal activity.

604
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:58,947
Crime is out of control
in this city.

605
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,381
I'm gonna stop and frisk you.

606
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:05,385
Grow up!
Anger is what runs the world.

607
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:09,891
I want you to go tell
all those who have lost

608
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:11,492
family members to these animals

609
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:14,995
that increased policing
is unnecessary.

610
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:17,331
-This and more tonight at 10:00.
-Teeth were pulled,

611
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:20,167
limbs cut clean, and the rest
was sent to the kiln.

612
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,769
Left with nothing
to identify them

613
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:23,605
other than what
was in their wallets.

614
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:26,240
My sources at PD

615
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:27,976
estimate the remains
have been laying out there

616
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,076
for at least a week.

617
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:30,177
Tragic.

618
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:33,080
Well, we can't slow down
just because those two

619
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:34,481
couldn't take care
of themselves.

620
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:36,851
Let's have Wendy push
forward on their leads.

621
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:40,153
We don't have a Wendy here.

622
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:41,589
Her, right there, Wendy.

623
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,792
That's Diane.

624
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:46,861
What difference does it make
what her name is?

625
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:48,863
Let's just have her
pick up the slack!

626
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:51,866
Wendy!

627
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,569
[hold music playing on phone]

628
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,707
Most parents would be proud.

629
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:01,843
[hold music continues]

630
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:03,377
Proud of what?

631
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,549
[hold music continues]

632
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:09,517
Thank you for calling
Caste Insurance.

633
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:11,118
So I may better
assist your call,

634
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,453
please tell me why
you are calling today.

635
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:17,391
Open a claim.

636
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,161
Your wait time is 12 hours.

637
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:23,230
[hold music resumes]

638
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:31,238
Oh, good, my meat!

639
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:32,740
Thank you, Martin.

640
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:43,051
[lightly snoring]

641
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,153
Thank you.

642
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:22,757
Sleep well.

643
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,159
It's a little bright.

644
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:29,129
Sorry.

645
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:34,434
You ever make
a blanket campfire?

646
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:37,204
I've only ever used lye
and kerosene to burn things.

647
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:39,540
Ha, no.

648
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:41,441
Here, give me the flashlight.

649
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:42,744
It's okay.

650
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,585
[whispers] Sit down.

651
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:55,123
It's okay.

652
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,637
See, it's...

653
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,639
it's like a campfire, only

654
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:13,608
can't roast marshmallows.

655
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,179
Know any good ghost stories?

656
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:22,050
I only know one story.

657
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:24,152
Let's hear it!

658
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:26,386
Only if you want.

659
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:32,292
There was once a girl,

660
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:35,295
she could have been anything
she wanted to be in this world,

661
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:37,165
but she chose to
throw it all away.

662
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,069
She chose a life
of sin and deceit,

663
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,205
spending her time on the streets
with lowlifes and vagrants,

664
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:49,209
indulging the worst within
herself because she was too weak

665
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,278
to live a life
of honor and dignity.

666
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:55,049
Then one day, she got pregnant.

667
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:57,985
With no one to turn to,

668
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:00,021
and no certainty
of who the father was,

669
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:01,421
she became frightened.

670
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,958
She moved back in
with her mother

671
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:05,560
and tried to clean up her act,

672
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:10,230
but her cowardness
and selfishness were too strong.

673
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:15,302
And one night,

674
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:16,871
she put her son in his crib

675
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:19,807
and kissed him goodnight.

676
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:23,644
She walked down to the basement

677
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:25,412
with a shotgun in hand,

678
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,883
and she put an end
to her misery.

679
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,055
The end.

680
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:39,794
My grandma tells me
that story all the time.

681
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,563
It's about my mom.

682
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,070
Wow.

683
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:52,405
For what it's worth,

684
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,575
I don't have any memory
of my parents either.

685
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:56,944
How'd you lose them?

686
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,748
They were a couple
of teenagers who

687
00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:02,517
couldn't afford
the extra mouth to feed,

688
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,853
so they dropped me on
the doorstep of an orphanage

689
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,523
and never looked back.

690
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,026
Sorry.

691
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,434
Is that your mother?

692
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,172
No, it's, it's my fiancé,

693
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,541
Carrie.

694
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:28,042
She's pregnant.

695
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:29,944
I'm gonna be a father!

696
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:33,714
I'm gonna have the family that
you and I never got to have!

697
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,084
You're lucky.

698
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:40,955
I know, and I'm so grateful
every day.

699
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,559
I need to get back to my family.

700
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:45,927
It's not up to me.

701
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,228
Then who, Grandma?

702
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:49,697
-I should go.
-Lucas, wait!

703
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:52,800
Lucas, please!

704
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,015
Lucas, what are you
still doing here?

705
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:10,117
I thought you'd be gone by now.

706
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,185
I'm going now.

707
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:13,988
Oh, don't forget your gloves!

708
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,824
There's a little nip
in the air tonight.

709
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:21,289
What do you need?

710
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:25,893
All right, dude,
I don't have all day,

711
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:27,228
I have a family to feed.

712
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:37,071
Are you--are you all right
in there?

713
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:39,307
[shrieking]

714
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:45,746
[inhales, pants]

715
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,381
I'm sorry.

716
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:52,853
[birdsong]

717
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:56,624
[sizzling]

718
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:00,428
What happened last night, Lucas?

719
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,796
No one was there.

720
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:05,199
There's always someone there.

721
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:07,435
That is how this works.

722
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:08,936
[toast scraping]

723
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,939
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

724
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,308
[toast scraping]

725
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:17,445
[plate clatters]

726
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:20,381
If you can't do
the simplest task,

727
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:22,650
then maybe you don't deserve
to live in my house

728
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:24,952
-and eat my food!
-Maybe I don't!

729
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:26,420
[plate shatters]

730
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:28,322
You ruthless boy!

731
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:35,129
How dare you waste this?

732
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:38,466
Open your mouth, come on.

733
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:42,636
Open it or I will open it
for you.

734
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:49,944
Chew.

735
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:57,852
Here at Caste Insurance,

736
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:00,488
we understand
that life is priceless.

737
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,556
But life insurance,

738
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,127
well, that can be as low
as $10 a month.

739
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,262
Because at Caste Insurance,

740
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:10,664
your life is our life.

741
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,012
[sighs]

742
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:26,347
I talked to him last night.

743
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:29,717
-You what?
-Yeah, while you were asleep,

744
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,685
he came down here and gave us
these pillows and blankets,

745
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,621
and he looked alone,

746
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:35,956
so, I showed him how to make
a blanket campfire, you know,

747
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,225
like when you were kids,
and he opened up to me.

748
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,327
You know, he told me
this messed up story

749
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:43,532
about this lady drug addict
who turned out to be his mom.

750
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:44,965
He doesn't even know
who his dad is.

751
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,634
It's crazy,
it's not as crazy as my story,

752
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:49,070
'cause he still has a grandma
and lived in this nice house,

753
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:50,571
but it was messed up.

754
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,039
His face was so still.

755
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:56,210
But his eyes
had all the emotion in it.

756
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:58,045
It was amazing, maybe he'll
tell you the story tonight.

757
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,847
It's incredible. Then he told me

758
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,749
that his mom blew her brains out

759
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:03,684
in this basement with a shotgun.

760
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:06,921
And I knew there was something
weird about this basement.

761
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:08,355
Then he showed me
a picture of her,

762
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:09,757
and I showed him a picture
of Carrie, and you know

763
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,158
how people react to Carrie.

764
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:13,027
He really connected with her.

765
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:15,530
And then I told him
that she was pregnant,

766
00:43:15,564 --> 00:43:17,765
and I don't think
he's gonna hurt us.

767
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:20,434
He's a good guy, he just needs
to know we're on his side.

768
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:23,572
I think he's gonna kill us both
if we don't kill him first.

769
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:26,107
We can't abandon hope.

770
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,577
What hope, Noah?

771
00:43:29,544 --> 00:43:31,345
If we want to survive,

772
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,714
then we have to earn it
at any cost.

773
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:36,684
We have to be ruthless
and unforgiving,

774
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:39,920
because nothing,
and I mean nothing,

775
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:41,789
is accomplished through hope.

776
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:52,466
I just don't believe
that was my Noah.

777
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:54,869
It couldn't have been.

778
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:58,973
And I refuse to give up hope.

779
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:02,042
Carrie, sweetie,
I truly commend your strength

780
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:04,513
during this time. There we go.

781
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:10,317
-Thank you, Paula.
-Of course.

782
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:13,220
And all of us are keeping hope
alive here, too,

783
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:15,055
so you're not alone.

784
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:16,957
And just so we're on
the same page,

785
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:19,927
keeping hope alive
means we have to maintain Noah

786
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,362
as a missing person.

787
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:25,299
Oh, I totally understand.

788
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:27,935
I have no interest
in his life insurance policy.

789
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:29,336
I just--I want him back.

790
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,971
Great, can we get that
in writing?

791
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:33,340
-Oh, I--
-I'm just gonna send you

792
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:34,475
to Wendy in legal.

793
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:35,544
-Okay
-Thank you.

794
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,079
Carrie, we'll be in touch
while things develop.

795
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:40,649
Okay, bye, sweetie. That way.

796
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,149
Excuse me, sir,
you can't come in here.

797
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:49,323
-Can I help you?
-This is Caste Insurance,

798
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,625
is it not?

799
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:52,993
According to all the signs, yes.

800
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:55,996
Then, yes,
you can help me, Ms. Caste.

801
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,132
And you can start
by opening up a claim

802
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,700
for Sonny's life insurance.

803
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:02,002
Ah, you must be Mr. Reddy.

804
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:03,704
You know, you could have called
to open a claim.

805
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:06,140
We have several representatives
standing by.

806
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:08,442
Ah, if only you made it
that easy.

807
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:11,478
Perhaps if your employees
didn't go missing on the job,

808
00:45:11,513 --> 00:45:13,113
I would have been able
to get through.

809
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:15,449
What happened to Sonny
was tragic,

810
00:45:15,482 --> 00:45:16,651
and I can assure you
we have tried--

811
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:19,153
No, let me assure you,
Ms. Caste,

812
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:22,223
I will stop at nothing
until you pay out

813
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:23,958
my son's life policy.

814
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:26,260
And if you don't,

815
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:29,698
you can expect to hear
from my lawyers.

816
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:33,535
Well, may we all move on

817
00:45:33,568 --> 00:45:35,970
as quickly as you have,
Mr. Reddy.

818
00:45:36,003 --> 00:45:38,540
You're messing
with the wrong guy.

819
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:41,175
You're all messing
with the wrong guy!

820
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:51,852
-Back to work.
-I am the wrong guy!

821
00:45:57,592 --> 00:45:59,093
Back to work!

822
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:01,028
What about your IRS insider?
I thought the whole point

823
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:02,731
was so that we had
protection in place.

824
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,365
It's not an audit
I'm worried about.

825
00:46:04,398 --> 00:46:06,534
Our claim reserves are
almost completely dried up.

826
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:09,370
-Brent.
-Paula, it's just a boat.

827
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:11,372
What did you just say to me?

828
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:18,747
That [bleep] thinks
that he can come in here,

829
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:21,583
my place of business,
and extort me?

830
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:23,284
[laughs wryly]

831
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:24,619
Who are we talking about
exactly?

832
00:46:24,653 --> 00:46:25,919
Sonny's dad.

833
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:28,757
He wants to collect
on his life policy.

834
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,157
In full.

835
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:33,294
I don't think that qualifies
as extortion.

836
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:34,596
We need to gain leverage,

837
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:37,532
otherwise we are
completely [bleep].

838
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:40,167
I'm sorry,
am I missing something here?

839
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:41,935
Okay, you two.

840
00:46:42,637 --> 00:46:46,273
Listen to me,
and listen very carefully.

841
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:49,778
We don't pay out on big claims

842
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,748
because we don't have policies
to pay them through.

843
00:46:57,484 --> 00:47:03,257
So... you're collecting premiums
as pure profit?

844
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,693
Paula, that's...

845
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:08,228
You're committing fraud.

846
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:11,332
No, we are committing fraud.

847
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:14,501
You two have been enforcing
company practices for years.

848
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:17,237
Therefore, we don't want
to go to jail

849
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:19,106
so we have to continue
to work together.

850
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,208
Does this make sense to you?
Do you understand?

851
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,345
What do you need us to do?

852
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:27,314
Thank you, I need you to do
some real detective work.

853
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:30,451
Get dirt on Mr. Reddy.
See what he's been up to.

854
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:32,986
See if you can find
anything that he's hiding.

855
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,022
We'll get right on it.

856
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:37,525
Good. Oh, and one more thing.

857
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:41,596
Nobody will believe you over me.

858
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,401
Just something to think about.

859
00:47:48,803 --> 00:47:51,872
[items clattering]

860
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:55,943
[keys jangle]

861
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:58,613
Lucas.

862
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:04,218
Come.

863
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:05,886
Come sit next to Grandma.

864
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:13,427
I have something that
I think you've been looking for.

865
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,199
Bet you thought you lost it.

866
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:22,537
I gave you this photograph
because I wanted you to know

867
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,506
that your mother,

868
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:26,541
that she...

869
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:29,410
...she abandoned us.

870
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:31,044
[sighs]

871
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,380
She didn't want you.

872
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:37,951
I am the only person
who has ever taken care of you.

873
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,758
I'm the only person
who has ever accepted you.

874
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:48,563
I think you're old enough now
to accept that and move on.

875
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:52,834
Oh, how about
a piece of pie, hm?

876
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:56,203
Oh, I know.

877
00:48:56,236 --> 00:48:59,072
Never dessert before dinner.

878
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:02,276
But I think we can bend
the rules just this once.

879
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:03,878
[smooches]

880
00:49:11,218 --> 00:49:14,556
[whimpering]

881
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:21,228
You don't need to be afraid
of her, Lucas.

882
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:22,864
You're not alone.

883
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:24,799
Sonny and I are on your side.

884
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:25,867
We can work together.

885
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:28,536
And the most important thing is,

886
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,705
we can't abandon hope.

887
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:33,106
Hope.

888
00:49:35,108 --> 00:49:36,611
Okay.

889
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:38,813
Okay, you're gonna let us out?

890
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,048
It won't be easy.

891
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,818
There are cameras everywhere.

892
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:45,753
So we'll need a distraction.

893
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:52,159
You have to put in a code
to unlock the door.

894
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,630
And then you only have
a few moments to escape

895
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:57,498
before she makes it downstairs.

896
00:49:57,532 --> 00:49:59,166
We'll move quickly,
but what about you?

897
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,367
I'll be fine.

898
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:02,770
[sighs]

899
00:50:02,804 --> 00:50:03,938
What's the code?

900
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:06,808
The code is two...

901
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,980
Three...

902
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:15,750
-Seven--
-I just have to say

903
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:17,585
how incredibly brave
this is of you.

904
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,688
I can't imagine what it's like
to stand up to your grandma.

905
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:22,256
I never had a grandma.

906
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,792
I never had a dad or a mom
or a brother or sister.

907
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:26,928
I didn't even have a friend
until I met Sonny.

908
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:29,029
And now you.

909
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:30,297
Things are gonna be okay.

910
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,667
[thud]

911
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,101
What the [bleep], Sonny?

912
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:35,770
You might have just killed him.

913
00:50:35,803 --> 00:50:38,673
So what? I'm not trying to play
sleepover the rest of my life.

914
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:40,474
[keys jangling]

915
00:50:40,508 --> 00:50:43,945
Lucas. Lucas?
Are you okay, Lucas?

916
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:47,682
Lucas? He was gonna let us
out of here peacefully.

917
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:50,384
Yeah? Well, now I'm getting us
out of here.

918
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:53,955
[keys jangling]

919
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:55,455
I'll be right back, Lucas.

920
00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:59,092
[door opens]

921
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:04,131
-[whispering] Sonny. Sonny!
-[whispering] Shut up.

922
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:05,767
-Sonny!
-Shut up!

923
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:12,139
You're not gonna be able
to open it. You need a code.

924
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:15,075
He was giving me the code right
before you knocked him out.

925
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:20,180
What the [bleep]?

926
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,415
We can still fix this.

927
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:23,250
He's trapped too.

928
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,687
[grunting]

929
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,487
[panting]

930
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:29,924
We can't get out of here
without him, Sonny.

931
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:32,359
We can't get out of here if you
just stand there doing nothing.

932
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:34,862
Doing nothing?
Are you even listening to me?

933
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:37,599
I've been listening to you
for the past ten years, Noah.

934
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:41,335
All you do is talk, on and on,
about absolutely nothing.

935
00:51:41,368 --> 00:51:44,404
So, for once in your life,
just make yourself useful.

936
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:46,373
Make myself useful?

937
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:48,208
We're--we're partners, Sonny.

938
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:49,476
Best friends.

939
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,581
We are not best friends.

940
00:51:53,615 --> 00:51:56,918
We're just co-workers,
you weirdo, okay?

941
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:59,419
And not for long either,
because once we get out of here,

942
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,488
I'm gonna be your [bleep] boss.

943
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:05,125
What are you talking about?

944
00:52:05,158 --> 00:52:07,394
I'm done splitting
my commission with you.

945
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,030
Your commission?

946
00:52:09,063 --> 00:52:11,431
-We both earned that.
-Did we?

947
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:13,534
Are you sure about that?

948
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:16,403
Huh, then why am I the one
getting promoted?

949
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:18,539
I really wonder.
[bleep] baffled.

950
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:20,742
Oh my God, I know why.

951
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:23,377
Because you're a worker bee
and I'm a leader.

952
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,912
I'm a shark.

953
00:52:24,946 --> 00:52:26,246
Where is this coming from?

954
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:27,582
We've always been
in this together.

955
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:29,483
Been in what together, Noah?

956
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:32,620
This is life,
survival of the fittest.

957
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:35,556
Just ask your [bleep] parents.

958
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:38,059
[thud]

959
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:41,161

[clattering]

962
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:00,380
I loved you like a brother!

963
00:53:01,616 --> 00:53:03,450
I had your back since day one!

964
00:53:04,052 --> 00:53:06,319
I asked you to be
my kid's godfather!

965
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,089
And this is how you repay me?

966
00:53:08,122 --> 00:53:10,858
[panting]

967
00:53:10,892 --> 00:53:13,161
This is your fault,
you're making me do this.

968
00:53:14,996 --> 00:53:18,465
[gagging]

[panting]

971
00:53:33,848 --> 00:53:36,017
Sonny, help me.

972
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:38,251
Please.

973
00:53:40,154 --> 00:53:42,590

[footsteps creaking]

975
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:31,038
Grandma?

976
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,441
You up?

977
00:54:41,616 --> 00:54:42,784
Grandma?

978
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:47,121
You need to unlock...

979
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:49,757
[static]

980
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:07,575
Who are all these people?

981
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:11,179
That's the food supply.

982
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:18,085
[footsteps]

983
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:34,302
The food?

984
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,305
Oh my God.

985
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,539
[gun cocks]

986
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:40,107
Drop it.

987
00:55:41,209 --> 00:55:42,643
[knife clatters]

988
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:43,945
[chuckles]

989
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:45,813
We can work this out, okay?

990
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:47,480
There's a plan for everything.

991
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:49,951
No one is allowed
in Grandma's room.

992
00:55:49,984 --> 00:55:51,819
Listen, I'm not gonna tell
anybody about this.

993
00:55:51,853 --> 00:55:53,353
[sputtering, grunting]

994
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:57,390
I told you, Lucas.

995
00:55:57,424 --> 00:55:59,694
It'll always be us
against the world.

996
00:56:02,063 --> 00:56:04,497
[panting]

997
00:56:08,002 --> 00:56:09,637
Well, don't just stand there,
Lucas.

998
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,506
Get that filthy pig
out of my room.

Oh!

00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:55,016
Mm!

1007
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:08,896
What a shame.

1008
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:12,566
A little more time to grow
and he could've been a cash cow.

Do not look away.

He was not your friend.

1012
00:57:36,424 --> 00:57:39,293
He was just useless swine.

1013
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,362
But you don't care
about that, huh?

1014
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:45,132
You don't mind being associated
with filthy lowlife.

1015
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:47,635
You're just like your mother.

1016
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:50,104
You would rather be left
with nothing,

1017
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:52,940
nobody by your side.

Beautiful meat.

1023
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:30,144
You save me so much money,
yes, you do.

[exhales]

1025
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:50,097
It's all just been
so much at once.

1026
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:54,502
With my dear Sonny
being murdered.

1027
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,371
These bills piling up.

1028
00:58:57,405 --> 00:59:01,609
And nobody by my side
to even confide in.

1029
00:59:03,244 --> 00:59:08,482
And I know,
my personal life is just that.

1030
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:09,683
Personal.

1031
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:14,221
But I hope you can understand,

1032
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:17,691
not, not as a person
who's a banker,

1033
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:21,095
but simply as a person...

1034
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:27,468
...how difficult
this time is for me.

1035
00:59:29,603 --> 00:59:36,610
I am the right guy
for this business loan.

1036
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:38,813
No, too much.

1037
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:43,184
I am the right guy
for this business loan, sir.

1038
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:44,485
No, no, sir.

1039
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:46,720
Don't be ingratiating,
you [bleep] idiot.

1040
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:51,560
I am the right guy
for this business loan.

1041
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:55,530
You are the right guy.

1042
00:59:58,065 --> 00:59:59,400
I am the right guy.

1043
01:00:00,468 --> 01:00:03,104
I'm the right guy.

1044
01:00:03,137 --> 01:00:06,006
I am the right guy.

1045
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,908
I am the right guy!

[grunting]

1049
01:00:19,653 --> 01:00:21,188
So where'd they pick you up at?

1050
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:25,392
[bleep], they got me
over on 65th.

1051
01:00:25,426 --> 01:00:27,428
It wasn't even like
I was pushing weight.

1052
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:30,064
I swore I was done
with that [bleep].

1053
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:32,299
I was just doing what I had
to do to survive, you know?

1054
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,301
You don't have to explain
to me, man.

1055
01:00:35,503 --> 01:00:37,271
Fools like us
never stood a chance.

1056
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:38,573
Speak for yourself.

1057
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:39,773
I'm getting out of here
on my own.

1058
01:00:40,509 --> 01:00:42,743
[bleep], that's what I said
the first few months.

1059
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:48,215
Oh my God, oh my God.

1060
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:50,151
Oh my God,
get me the [bleep] outta here.

1061
01:00:51,152 --> 01:00:53,522
[camera shutter clicking]

1062
01:00:55,689 --> 01:00:57,358
Quiet neighborhood, nice house.

1063
01:00:58,425 --> 01:01:00,127
Sweet car.

1064
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:02,463
I really don't think we're gonna
find anything on this guy.

1065
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:03,831
You'd be amazed
the kind of [bleep] up [bleep]

1066
01:01:03,864 --> 01:01:05,166
that goes on in the suburbs.

1067
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:08,269
Yeah, I grew up in the suburbs.
I'm well aware.

1068
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:11,438
He's probably got people
locked up in there.

1069
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:14,475
Tied up, greased up.

1070
01:01:14,509 --> 01:01:17,111
Yes, look it, he's just
a normal guy going to work.

1071
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:19,113
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1072
01:01:22,483 --> 01:01:24,418
[engine starting]

1073
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:26,020
What are you doing?

1074
01:01:26,053 --> 01:01:27,955
My job.

1075
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:29,723
I suggest you do the same.

1076
01:01:30,491 --> 01:01:31,825
[sighs] [bleep].

1077
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:32,927
[panting]

1078
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,994
[door creaks open]

1079
01:01:36,197 --> 01:01:38,132
[footsteps approaching]

1080
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,401
Grandma says it's your time.

1081
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,538
[panting]

1082
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,012
Hey, you know, uh,
just thinking about this.

1083
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:53,981
I am up for a promotion at work,

1084
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,349
which I am pretty proud of.

1085
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:56,551
If you let me out now,

1086
01:01:56,585 --> 01:01:58,886
I could consider you
as a new hire.

1087
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:01,455
I mean, we'd have to start you
off with a base salary,

1088
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:03,625
but the benefits
make up for that.

1089
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:04,892
Quiet.

1090
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:06,661
[panting]

1091
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:08,663
I'm sure you want a change
from all of this, Lucas.

1092
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:09,830
That's why you were
gonna let us out, right?

1093
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:10,898
Enough.

1094
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:14,468
Grandma doesn't care about you.

1095
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:15,670
Stop it.

1096
01:02:15,704 --> 01:02:17,838
[panting]

1097
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:19,273
My dad's the same way, you know.

1098
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:23,911
I mean, I have spent
my whole life

1099
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:25,913
trying to prove my worth to him,

1100
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:28,148
and yet somehow
he always finds a reason

1101
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:29,850
for why I'm not good enough.

1102
01:02:29,883 --> 01:02:32,219
[panting]

1103
01:02:32,253 --> 01:02:33,854
Because at the end of the day,

1104
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:37,224
all he cares about
is his money and status.

1105
01:02:38,627 --> 01:02:40,494
You need to take her out.

1106
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:42,763
I said stop it.

1107
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:46,601
[panting]

1108
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:50,104
[door unlocking]

1109
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:51,573
[door creaking]

1110
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:54,775
This is not part of our job!

1111
01:02:54,808 --> 01:02:55,909
Shh!

1112
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,278
[muttering]

1113
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:59,013
Look.

1114
01:02:59,046 --> 01:03:00,914
It's time to focus up, Frank.

1115
01:03:02,149 --> 01:03:03,217
And remember,

1116
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:06,120
something big enough
to destroy him.

1117
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:10,457
Oh my God, oh my God.

1118
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:12,594
Oh my God!

1119
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:16,698
[papers rustling]

1120
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:23,837
[engine starting]

1121
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,448
Okay, all I got are
a bunch of overdue bills

1122
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,150
and this invoice from...

1123
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:38,185
Straight Off the Block
Meat Company.

1124
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:40,722
Holy crap, this guy
was selling cheap meat.

1125
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:43,324
Declined loan application
for a hundred grand.

1126
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:45,159
That's why he's been so adamant

1127
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:47,629
about getting Sonny's
life insurance payout.

1128
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:48,962
Okay, let's go!

1129
01:03:49,463 --> 01:03:51,198
Paula's gonna gut him.

1130
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:54,868
[door creaking]

1131
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:09,784
[thud]

1132
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:22,162
Election Day has arrived,

1133
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:24,599
and hours before
the polls closed,

1134
01:04:24,632 --> 01:04:27,301
we sat down with
District Attorney Glenn Garrey

1135
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:28,770
-for an in-depth...
-Grandma.

1136
01:04:28,803 --> 01:04:31,271
...one-on-one interview
where, for the first time...

1137
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:33,440
-He's ready.
-...he spoke openly

1138
01:04:33,474 --> 01:04:35,710
about the loss of his daughter.

1139
01:04:35,744 --> 01:04:38,345
You can't abandon hope.

1140
01:04:38,379 --> 01:04:39,913
We can't abandon hope.

1141
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:44,885
Hope.

1142
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:47,822
That's why we've never given up

1143
01:04:47,856 --> 01:04:50,759
when seeking justice
for our daughter.

1144
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,428
She was a good person, you know.

1145
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:57,331
She wasn't perfect...

1146
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:16,283
[phone vibrating]

1147
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:27,327
You've reached
agent Danika Palmer,

1148
01:05:27,361 --> 01:05:29,229
Caste Insurance, make it quick.

1149
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:31,098
[slamming phone]

1150
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:35,737
She had her struggles,
but she wasn't... some criminal.

1151
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,171
[sighs]

1152
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:39,072
The only reason drugs
became a problem for her

1153
01:05:39,106 --> 01:05:41,275
is because of how readily

1154
01:05:41,308 --> 01:05:44,779
available they were
and still are.

1155
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:48,215
I mean, all you have to do,
all anyone has to do

1156
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:51,452
is walk south of 65th Street
a couple of blocks,

1157
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:56,023
and you enter into
an entirely different world

1158
01:05:56,056 --> 01:05:59,226
filled, filled with people

1159
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:03,030
who choose to live
in sin and squalor.

1160
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:07,434
Those people destroyed
my daughter.

1161
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:10,672
They're the ones

1162
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:13,775
who took her away
from my family.

1163
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:17,812
My wife and I
will never forgive them,

1164
01:06:17,846 --> 01:06:20,481
and that is why,
if I am re-elected...

1165
01:06:20,515 --> 01:06:23,984
What are you doing in my room?

1166
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:27,321
You--you're--you're not--

1167
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:31,458
That is exactly why you're not
allowed to watch television.

1168
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:33,160
Rots your brain.

1169
01:06:36,965 --> 01:06:38,298
She's not your daughter.

1170
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:41,335
You're not my grandma.

1171
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:43,872
I didn't know that she was
pregnant when I picked her up.

1172
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:48,342
-Why would you lie?
-I did not lie to you, Lucas!

1173
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:51,311
I gave you a chance at life.

1174
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:53,748
She was still shooting up
when she was pregnant with you.

1175
01:06:53,781 --> 01:06:56,250
I did you and the rest
of the world a favor.

1176
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,920
She could've been helped.

1177
01:06:59,888 --> 01:07:02,022
They all could be helped!

1178
01:07:02,055 --> 01:07:04,659
There's no need
in helping the helpless.

1179
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:06,861
They will only waste away
what they are given

1180
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:09,329
because they don't have
what it takes to survive.

1181
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:11,533
The only useful
and productive thing

1182
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:14,536
for them to do
is to give their selves to us.

1183
01:07:14,569 --> 01:07:18,472
You must either eat
or else be eaten.

1184
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:20,474
That's the way it's always been,

1185
01:07:20,508 --> 01:07:21,776
that's the way
it always will be.

1186
01:07:22,644 --> 01:07:24,946
You stay right there!

1187
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:26,046
[smacks]

1188
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:31,953
People tend to think
that the bigger the cut of meat,

1189
01:07:31,986 --> 01:07:34,822
the better,
but what they fail to understand

1190
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:39,126
is all that simply matters
is how the meat is cared for.

1191
01:07:39,159 --> 01:07:42,496
You've heard, perhaps,
of Kobe beef. Hm?

1192
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:46,233
Well, Kobe beef sets itself
apart for a number of reasons,

1193
01:07:46,266 --> 01:07:49,136
the most important being

1194
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:52,139
that it's treated
with tenderness

1195
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:55,309
to create, well,
a more tender piece of meat.

1196
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:59,379
You have to relax the muscle,

1197
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:03,417
which marbles the area
with a beautiful layer of fat.

1198
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:07,321
And then we have
the low-grade meat.

1199
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:08,656
[grunting]

1200
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,025
Meat which never really stood
a chance.

1201
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,426
[panting]

1202
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:15,395
Nor deserved one.

1203
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:16,864
[grunting]

1204
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:25,673
[deep inhale]

1205
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,943
[deep exhale]

1206
01:08:28,977 --> 01:08:30,177
[groaning]

1207
01:08:33,915 --> 01:08:36,249
[groaning]

1208
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:38,318
[breathing heavily]

1209
01:08:52,165 --> 01:08:53,568
[groaning]

1210
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:55,837
[panting]

1211
01:09:02,977 --> 01:09:06,446
[breathing heavily]

1212
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:18,559
[muffled screaming]

1213
01:09:18,593 --> 01:09:19,794
[sobbing]

1214
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:22,597
You know,
I might not even eat you.

1215
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:25,265
I'm just gonna enjoy cutting
you up into little pieces.

1216
01:09:25,298 --> 01:09:26,601
[panting]

1217
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:28,201
Let's get to it then, shall we?

1218
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:33,775
[panting, groaning]

1219
01:09:35,543 --> 01:09:39,647
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

1220
01:09:40,882 --> 01:09:44,519
Catch a piggy by its toe.

1221
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:49,423
If it squeals, kill it slow.

1222
01:09:49,456 --> 01:09:53,628
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

1223
01:09:53,661 --> 01:09:55,997
[panting]

1224
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:05,039
[screaming, grunting]

1225
01:10:06,841 --> 01:10:07,875
[slicing]

1226
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:11,179
[gagging, screaming]

1227
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:14,115
Lucas, damn it!

1228
01:10:14,148 --> 01:10:16,884
[groaning]

1229
01:10:16,918 --> 01:10:19,520
[mumbling]

1230
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:20,855
Lucas, stop it!

1231
01:10:23,323 --> 01:10:24,892
Stop it!

1232
01:10:24,926 --> 01:10:28,495
[panting]

1233
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:32,934
[gasping for breath]

1234
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:36,204
[seething exhales]

1235
01:10:38,338 --> 01:10:40,307
[groaning]

1236
01:10:41,341 --> 01:10:44,311
[coughing]

1237
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:46,748
I trusted you.

1238
01:10:48,281 --> 01:10:51,384
[screaming, slicing]

1239
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:57,390
[freezer humming]

1240
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,098
[blood dripping]

1241
01:11:06,033 --> 01:11:07,068
[door opening]

1242
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:09,971
[freezer humming]

1243
01:11:13,373 --> 01:11:14,942
[sighs]

1244
01:11:14,976 --> 01:11:18,079
[panting]

1245
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:24,051
You need to let me out, now.

1246
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:29,957
Okay.

1247
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:32,059
[footsteps scrape and thud]

1248
01:11:35,797 --> 01:11:38,298
[groaning]

1249
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:42,703
[breathing heavily]

1250
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:43,771
[keypad beeping]

1251
01:11:43,805 --> 01:11:45,372
You were right about her.

1252
01:11:45,405 --> 01:11:47,008
Just unlock the door.

1253
01:11:48,242 --> 01:11:50,545
I have felt trapped
my entire life.

1254
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:53,380
A prisoner like all the others.

1255
01:11:54,148 --> 01:11:55,650
But now I see

1256
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:59,887
that I only have myself
to blame.

1257
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:03,423
Move one more [bleep] inch
and I will blow your head off.

1258
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,295
[breathing heavily]

1259
01:12:09,297 --> 01:12:12,365
It's no different out there
than it is in here.

1260
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:24,679
[cork pops, cheering]

1261
01:12:24,712 --> 01:12:26,013
That is live coverage

1262
01:12:26,047 --> 01:12:27,782
from Glenn Garrey's
campaign headquarters

1263
01:12:27,815 --> 01:12:31,152
as Garrey is predicted to win
re-election by a landslide.

1264
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:34,922
His "Sweep the Streets" campaign
ignited a firestorm...

1265
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:36,456
How about your Porsche?

1266
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:37,825
[sighs]

1267
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:39,160
Which one?

1268
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,529
The 2012,
or any of them, really.

1269
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,031
What about the Jag--

1270
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:45,166
No.

1271
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,367
The Hummer.

1272
01:12:48,703 --> 01:12:49,904
Which color?

1273
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,541
The cream...

1274
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:55,843
and the white.

1275
01:12:55,877 --> 01:12:58,212
Great, we'll get a lot back
for those.

1276
01:12:58,846 --> 01:12:59,947
[door slams]

1277
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:01,182
[gasping, muttering]

1278
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:04,218
-Oh, my God.
-Holy [bleep].

1279
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:11,993
[groaning]

1280
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:18,866
[groaning]

1281
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:29,409
[groaning]

1282
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:40,354
[panting]

1283
01:13:41,856 --> 01:13:43,591
[deep exhale]

1284
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:45,893
[bottle opens]

1285
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,396
[exhaling, cork bouncing]

1286
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:56,103
I want...

1287
01:13:56,137 --> 01:13:58,105
that [bleep] promotion.

1288
01:14:00,574 --> 01:14:02,276
You're a shark.

1289
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:05,413
I'm a great white.

1290
01:14:18,392 --> 01:14:20,127
Back to work!

1291
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:30,204
[telephone ringing]

1292
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:32,807
Paula, Pau--

1293
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,208
What the [bleep]?

1294
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:35,609
[phone ringing]

1295
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:40,314
[clearing throat] Yes?

1296
01:14:40,348 --> 01:14:43,818
-Hey, it's Danika.
-This isn't part of the job!

1297
01:14:43,851 --> 01:14:45,920
Oh, I-I meant to call you.

1298
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:47,154
We're all clear here.

1299
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:49,757
-Yeah...
-Oh my God.

1300
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,926
We're not all clear over here.

1301
01:14:51,959 --> 01:14:54,862
This isn't part of the job!
This isn't part of the job!

1302
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,431
I do files!

1303
01:14:57,465 --> 01:15:00,935
I'm just a regular guy
who loves insurance!

1304
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:03,004
That's all! That's all I am!

1305
01:15:03,037 --> 01:15:04,171
I love insurance!

1306
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:05,840
Is that so wrong?

1307
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:07,575
Oh, my God.

1308
01:15:07,608 --> 01:15:08,909
I'm not a murderer!

1309
01:15:08,943 --> 01:15:11,078
I'm just a regular guy
who loves insurance.

1310
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:12,446
I love insurance!

1311
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,514
So what?

1312
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:15,016
I'm not a killer!

1313
01:15:15,049 --> 01:15:16,217
I'm not a murderer!

1314
01:15:17,818 --> 01:15:19,620
You've reached Ram Reddy.

1315
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:20,988
Leave a message at the tone.

1316
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:22,089
[beeps]

1317
01:15:22,123 --> 01:15:24,759
Dad, it's Sonny. Call me.

1318
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,360
I got some great news
at work today.

1319
01:15:27,294 --> 01:15:28,863
I think you're gonna be proud.

1320
01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:34,301
[panting]

1321
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:42,176
[sighs]

1322
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,681
Just clean it up.

1323
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:53,921
Paula, Paula!

1324
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:59,260
Is everything okay?

1325
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:04,198
Everything's as it should be.

1326
01:16:10,671 --> 01:16:13,707
