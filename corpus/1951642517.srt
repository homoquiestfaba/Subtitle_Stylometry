<i> there are many, many centuries, </i>
<i> in old China, </i>

2
00:00:46,367--> 00:00:50,360
<i> a very beautiful youth lived, </i>
<i> called Kwan Yin.</i>

3
00:00:53,647--> 00:00:58,084
<i> In a moment of passion, she was </i>
<i> pregnant still before marrying.</i>

4
00:00:59,127--> 00:01:02,403
<i> When the father discovered </i>
<i> such transgression, </i>

5
00:01:02,647--> 00:01:06,083
<i> it felt the bastard son's shame.</i>

6
00:01:06,687--> 00:01:11,715
<i> In a fit of anger, he perforated him/her </i>
<i> the eyes and it tore him/her the womb.</i>

7
00:01:11,927--> 00:01:17,001
<i> He believed that would annihilate like this </i>
<i> his/her body and his/her soul.</i>

8
00:01:18,647--> 00:01:24,244
<i> When dying, the youth pressed in the hand </i>
<i> a mysterious jade amulet </i>

9
00:01:24,407--> 00:01:27,205
<i> and it intoned a secret prayer.</i>

10
00:01:27,687--> 00:01:31,441
<i> When they buried her, still </i>
<i> it pressed in the hands the amulet.</i>

11
00:01:32,607--> 00:01:37,044
<i> According to the legend, the prayer allowed </i>
<i>. his/her soul to continue to live </i>

12
00:01:37,207--> 00:01:40,563
<i> and the amulet </i>
<i> it checked him/her can magic.</i>

13
00:01:41,007--> 00:01:44,716
<i> in the course of time, they were </i>
<i> raised temples in his/her memory.</i>

14
00:01:44,927--> 00:01:47,760
<i> most of their followers, </i>
<i> they worshipped her for the purity </i>

15
00:01:47,927--> 00:01:49,679
<i> that she had maintained in life.</i>

16
00:01:51,447--> 00:01:57,920
<i> But some adored her </i>
<i> for the power that she had in the death.</i>

17
00:01:58,047--> 00:02:02,643
<i> they Believed that who controlled </i>
<i> the amulet, would obtain a secret power.</i>

18
00:02:02,927--> 00:02:07,045
<i> they Believed to obtain the immortality, </i>
<i> if a pure soul was sacrificed </i>

19
00:02:07,207--> 00:02:10,324
<i> at the same time that if it intoned </i>
<i> Kwan Yin's prayer.</i>

20
00:02:11,167--> 00:02:14,204
<i> THE amulet was the key of everything.</i>

21
00:02:15,327--> 00:02:20,162
<i> 20 years ago, the epic demand </i>
<i> for the secret grave </i>

22
00:02:20,327--> 00:02:22,761

00:05:38,527--> 00:05:43,726
You will use her power in your advantage
and not for anything of pure.

41
00:05:44,727--> 00:05:50,359
I don't give you my soul!
No ta give.

42
00:05:59,607--> 00:06:00,926
No!

43
00:06:41,567--> 00:06:44,035
You will never have our souls.

44
00:06:44,287--> 00:06:45,845
Yours not.

45
00:06:52,687--> 00:06:56,965
I will wait
that your daughter Mindy grows.

46
00:06:57,647--> 00:06:59,683

UNIVERSITY OF FULLFORD
PRESENT

52
00:10:29,927--> 00:10:35,797
In the first half of the semester
we ended that Abraham, Jesus and Mohammed,

53
00:10:35,967--> 00:10:40,404
the three great illustrations of the monotheism,
they were worshipped.

54
00:10:40,607--> 00:10:42,165
What more they had them in common?

55
00:10:42,527--> 00:10:46,076
You won't say that had all
beard and they lived in the Medium East, Alex!

56
00:10:46,327--> 00:10:48,602
It is me to sand the whole jokes.

57
00:10:48,727--> 00:10:54,085
- You don't have joke...
- Remain silent, this can be important.

58
00:10:54,887--> 00:10:56,479
They were expelled of the breast...

59
00:11:00,407--> 00:11:03,877
- Are Mindy, well?
- Yes.

60
00:11:04,167--> 00:11:06,556
...that can give them
the so desired interior peace.

61
00:11:07,527--> 00:11:11,566
- I have a question.
- Say.

62
00:11:12,287--> 00:11:15,245
He/she is to try to compare the génese
of great world religions

63
00:11:15,407--> 00:11:16,806
with the sect idea?

64
00:11:16,967--> 00:11:19,720
Of course no. The sects
they are something totally different.

65
00:11:19,887--> 00:11:24,836
They end for perverting the own base
in that you/they were founded.

66
00:11:25,087--> 00:11:29,000
See what the followers have to do,
for if they maintain in the good thanks.

67
00:11:29,207--> 00:11:31,675
Some give the savings
of a life.

68
00:11:31,887--> 00:11:35,800
Others submit. mutilation
of the body.

69
00:11:36,087--> 00:11:41,286
And there are still the ones that arrive,
and allow me the cliché,

70
00:11:41,447--> 00:11:43,403
to go behind the maralha, so to speak.

71
00:11:45,007--> 00:11:46,725
I reformulate the original question.

72
00:11:46,887--> 00:11:52,086
What is that main religions of the
does world have in common with the sects?

73
00:11:52,647--> 00:11:54,399
- The district.
- Exactly.

74
00:11:54,727--> 00:11:59,164
They already heard to say that the terror of one
can man be the freedom of other?

75
00:12:00,247--> 00:12:03,637
A man's sect,
it can be the religion of other.

76
00:12:05,767--> 00:12:08,042
And for today, it arrives.

77
00:12:10,087--> 00:12:15,207
Remember that these final projects
they are worth 25% of your note.

78
00:12:15,567--> 00:12:20,721
Alex, Mindy, Cassandra,
Bailey and Morgan.

79
00:12:20,887--> 00:12:25,756
Be with me one more minutes.
I want to discuss your project.

80
00:12:26,527--> 00:12:28,404
I hope is fast.
I have training.

81
00:12:28,647--> 00:12:30,365
You are the mascot, mine!

82
00:12:31,367--> 00:12:34,040
Just because you have a spirit
depressing academic,

83
00:12:34,207--> 00:12:38,564
he/she doesn't have to unload in me.
Cover me the retreat.

84
00:12:38,767--> 00:12:42,999
Fork, Bears! Bears!
Bears will win...

85
00:12:46,807--> 00:12:48,877
- Where is Morgan?
- He/she is sick.

86
00:12:49,007--> 00:12:52,966
I think he/she had an infection, but I go
to be with her in the library, this night.

87
00:12:53,167--> 00:12:56,603
Very well, I was to review
the proposals of the projects

88
00:12:56,767--> 00:13:00,123
and, to be frank,
your it worries me.

89
00:13:00,327--> 00:13:02,045
But it is a radical research.

90
00:13:02,207--> 00:13:06,359
Do Massacre him/it of Kwan Yin's Temple?
That is almost a baseboard note

91
00:13:06,567--> 00:13:10,480
in the history Taoist and, still for top,
it is an open wound in this community.

92
00:13:10,647--> 00:13:12,638
But it is not that our function
of investigators?

93
00:13:12,807--> 00:13:16,083
To diffuse in the baseboard notes
and to do of them chapters of the History.

94
00:13:16,287--> 00:13:19,165
Because, what badly is that can have?

95
00:13:19,327--> 00:13:22,125
They can discover things
very disturbing.

96
00:13:22,407--> 00:13:24,967
As well as Jesus' scene
to be preached?

97
00:13:25,167--> 00:13:27,283
It is not only disturbing,
because we are already habituated. Right?

98
00:13:27,447--> 00:13:30,962
All of religions have yours
more shameful moments.

99
00:13:32,447--> 00:13:38,079
He/she is well, I don't only want
that you/they are enthusiastic of more.

100
00:13:38,647--> 00:13:43,198
Don't worry. We will maintain the
laziness and the indifference of the habit.

101
00:13:44,607--> 00:13:46,245
He/she is well, they can go.

102
00:13:47,087--> 00:13:48,645
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

103
00:13:49,807--> 00:13:51,001
- Are you well?
- Yes.

104
00:13:51,167--> 00:13:52,156
- Of certainty?
- Clear.

105
00:13:52,367--> 00:13:54,676
I thought that were to shake.
He/she walks here.

106
00:13:56,807--> 00:13:58,445
We see in the more afternoon.
Do I appear, ok?

107
00:14:03,087--> 00:14:08,241
Mindy, as it is that convinced them
to be so enthusiastic?

108
00:14:08,447--> 00:14:10,517
I don't know about what is to speak.

109
00:14:12,967--> 00:14:18,087
He/she told them that he/she was his/her student
favorite and that we would always have an A.

110
00:14:18,287--> 00:14:21,484
This project
he/she is going against my will.

111
00:14:22,327--> 00:14:26,036
Come to speak with me,
if they find some thing that...

112
00:14:26,887--> 00:14:28,400
That...

113
00:14:29,047--> 00:14:31,038
If they find some thing.

114
00:14:37,967--> 00:14:39,764
What is that he/she will happen with Mindy?

115
00:14:40,807--> 00:14:45,562
- That great intuition yours.
- Didn't you notice?

116
00:14:45,887--> 00:14:49,641
It was beside her, and she is mine
friend. What is that find?

117
00:14:52,847--> 00:14:57,967
- Do you want even to go thereabout?
- If you want.

118
00:14:59,087--> 00:15:01,123
Because it is that you don't enjoy
be we him together, Cassandra?

119
00:15:01,287--> 00:15:06,441
They are alone three years. Because it is that
do you have to be always so difficult?

120
00:15:11,207--> 00:15:12,686
I don't know.

121
00:15:34,087--> 00:15:35,315
"Mindy?"

122
00:15:39,007--> 00:15:40,406
"Who are you?"

123
00:15:43,447--> 00:15:45,199
"Your friend Bailey."

124
00:15:46,887--> 00:15:48,115
"Hello."

125
00:15:48,407--> 00:15:50,363
"How is it that he/she runs the study in group?"

126
00:15:57,007--> 00:15:59,396
"There is no group. I am alone me.
Morgan was frustrated."

127
00:15:59,567--> 00:16:00,841
I am not me to complain.

128
00:16:01,007--> 00:16:04,238
<i> I Think are. Apposed that nor </i>
<i> you left the residence the whole day.</i>

129
00:16:04,407--> 00:16:07,479
I was about 45 minutes in the crosswalk,
to do exercise.

130
00:16:07,687--> 00:16:12,203
<i> Because yes. You will bring that ember </i>
<i> of your room friend. party?</i>

131
00:16:12,407--> 00:16:14,159
I don't know if she goes.

132
00:16:14,447--> 00:16:17,962
He/she had a discussion with the father
today of guile and he/she left to cry.

133
00:16:23,487--> 00:16:24,886
Morgan?

134
00:16:31,407--> 00:16:32,760
"Are Bailey, oh?"

135
00:16:51,847--> 00:16:55,806
I gave cable of my whole work this
night and I have the inflamed throat.

136
00:16:56,047--> 00:16:57,765
<i> That should be of my enormous one...</i>

137
00:16:57,967--> 00:17:00,720
It is not anything of that.
You are really disgusting.

138
00:17:01,087--> 00:17:01,997
"Yes?"

139
00:17:02,167--> 00:17:04,078
"He/she will have with me to the patio, now!"

140
00:17:20,447--> 00:17:24,520
You are with luck, the parties of the
republic is only worthwhile after 11 o'clock.

<i> he/she Sees there if your room friend </i>

<i> I will have the house there.</i>

- Excuse.

151
00:17:55,527--> 00:17:57,404
<i> Who was that?</i>

152
00:17:58,047--> 00:18:01,403
It was only a hideous fufa
to arm in goat.

153
00:18:05,647--> 00:18:08,684
- What was?
- I tell you for the road, he/she walks.

154
00:18:26,687--> 00:18:29,599
Now, Mindy, are the sure that
was the image of the book Morgan?

155
00:18:29,807--> 00:18:32,526
He/she resembled her.
If it is like this, she runs danger.

156
00:19:03,207--> 00:19:04,686
<i> is there anybody?</i>

157
00:19:07,087--> 00:19:08,440

We walked. it seeks of Morgan.
Did you see her?

159
00:19:26,207--> 00:19:27,401
I didn't see her/it in the whole day.

00:19:27,567--> 00:19:30,320
- Do you make idea where she can be from?
- Because ray there was me of knowing?

- Quite distant and absentee... yes.

166
00:20:10,287--> 00:20:12,084
If he/she has more quest.es,
I enter in contact get.

167
00:20:12,247--> 00:20:14,203
- Right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

168
00:20:28,367--> 00:20:31,803
The Police judge
that Morgan committed suicide,

169
00:20:33,007--> 00:20:39,606
but I think her death
he/she makes to remind that of Kwan Yin.

170
00:20:40,167--> 00:20:43,842
She was not more involved
in the projecto than us.

171
00:20:44,727--> 00:20:47,082
You knew that she took
antidepressive?

172
00:20:47,287--> 00:20:50,120
No. We were not like this so arrivals,
but...

173
00:20:50,287--> 00:20:53,006
I find same that owed
to diffuse in another projecto.

174
00:20:53,327--> 00:20:57,115
Or then, I postpone the period
of the projecto if you...

175
00:20:57,287--> 00:20:59,562
No. I want to continue.

176
00:21:00,687--> 00:21:02,837
You don't want at least
to ask to the other ones?

177
00:21:03,007--> 00:21:05,157
It is not necessary.

178
00:21:20,527--> 00:21:21,846
Are you well?

179
00:21:24,247--> 00:21:26,238
He/she thought that had already gone you away.

180
00:21:26,527--> 00:21:29,166
And I went, but later I decided to wait for you.

181
00:21:29,807--> 00:21:31,320
So that?

182
00:21:32,687--> 00:21:34,598
He/she wanted to have the certainty
that were well.

183
00:21:34,767--> 00:21:36,280
Because it is that had to be?

184
00:21:38,607--> 00:21:44,000
- Already nothing of what sees myself surprises.
- How like this?

185
00:21:48,487--> 00:21:52,480
- Was it like this, your whole life?
- More or less.

186
00:21:52,807--> 00:21:55,321
Not always they were like this
strange or violent,

187
00:21:55,527--> 00:22:00,442
but from small that I see things
that I don't know how to explain.

188
00:22:01,527--> 00:22:05,725
- What type of things?
- I know there.

189
00:22:06,367--> 00:22:12,124
My mother's face to smile.
It is good, but it is strange.

190
00:22:12,247--> 00:22:16,684
She died when I had one year.
I don't know how it is that can remember.

191
00:22:17,287--> 00:22:19,403
That has to do with your visual cortex.

192
00:22:25,607--> 00:22:29,964
Then, there are things that I see
and that remove me the sleep.

193
00:22:30,687--> 00:22:36,444
A lot of things remind me that
of Kwan Yin's temple, that people.

194
00:22:38,087--> 00:22:41,045
Mindy, because it is that you didn't do
the alone investigation?

195
00:22:41,407--> 00:22:43,762
Because it is that dragged us?

196
00:22:45,807--> 00:22:48,480
I think he/she wanted somebody to lean on.

197
00:22:50,487--> 00:22:51,761
And you have.

198
00:23:00,807--> 00:23:01,922
I am.

199
00:23:03,527--> 00:23:05,324
Does he/she give me my teacup of coffee?

200
00:23:05,607--> 00:23:08,075
- Can you pick me in the work?
- Yes.

201
00:23:08,767--> 00:23:12,646
<i> - it is that I dislike to go alone home < /i >.
- Everything well.

202
00:23:16,767--> 00:23:17,677
Yes?

203
00:23:22,367--> 00:23:25,677
You order a < i > and - mail < /i > to the rest of the group
on the meeting tomorrow, right?

204
00:23:25,847--> 00:23:30,125
- Yes. It is .s two.
- Exacto.

205
00:23:30,647--> 00:23:34,117
You know that plus, Mindy, think if
we spoke to the Prof. Eastbrook,

206
00:23:34,287--> 00:23:35,720
she put us in a different projecto...

207
00:23:35,887--> 00:23:41,757
No. He/she wants to say, already falámos,
and she said for us to continue.

208
00:23:45,567--> 00:23:48,604
- Are you good with computers?
- I am an aselha.

209
00:23:49,007--> 00:23:51,646
- Because, because...
- Seriously.

210
00:23:51,807--> 00:23:54,037
You could research some thing
on Kwan Yin's temple.

211
00:23:54,287--> 00:23:55,606
Clear.

212
00:23:56,127--> 00:23:58,038
This explains everything.

213
00:24:52,087--> 00:24:53,122
Yes?

214
00:24:55,127--> 00:24:56,560
Who is there he/she?

215
00:25:09,607--> 00:25:11,802
Of the other times
he/she didn't also have grace.

216
00:25:20,247--> 00:25:22,317
He/she calms there, Kournikova.

217
00:25:23,647--> 00:25:26,764
- Did they return you to annoy today?
- Because it was.

218
00:25:27,807--> 00:25:31,595
When he/she meets, I give you a squeeze
that you never again straighten.

219
00:25:35,767--> 00:25:38,600
What is that happened you today
in the classes, small?

220
00:25:38,767--> 00:25:40,120
Anything. He/she was only tired.

221
00:25:40,327--> 00:25:42,841
If it suits have to go with more calm
in this projecto.

222
00:25:43,167--> 00:25:44,486
No, it is everything well.

223
00:25:44,687--> 00:25:50,762
.s times, when they grow,
the people relax a little.

224
00:25:50,927--> 00:25:53,646
Thank you, I know about that.

225
00:25:53,847--> 00:25:56,600
I won't meet as
encontrámos Morgan, yes?

226
00:25:56,807--> 00:25:58,035
No.

227
00:25:59,687--> 00:26:02,565
You already know that can count on me,
if you need of some thing.

228
00:26:02,767--> 00:26:04,359
Because it is that everyone
does he/she say the same?

229
00:26:04,527--> 00:26:09,681
Because? Because we adored you.

230
00:26:10,527--> 00:26:13,439
- Because yes.
- And you are a goat.

231
00:26:15,567--> 00:26:20,402
If you do want go see
the such temple marado,

232
00:26:20,887--> 00:26:22,957
you know that I align.

233
00:26:23,247--> 00:26:24,441
Fasten.

234
00:26:24,967--> 00:26:26,116
He/she walks here.

235
00:26:28,047--> 00:26:29,446
We see each other later.

236
00:26:48,967--> 00:26:49,956
Among.

237
00:26:53,647--> 00:26:55,160
Does he/she happen some thing?

238
00:26:56,447--> 00:27:01,362
No longer I know what is real and what is one
myth between this history and Morgan.

239
00:27:01,567--> 00:27:03,523
Mindy, learned if some thing
in my chair,

240
00:27:03,727--> 00:27:07,276
you know that everything is a myth.
The religion bases on the faith.

241
00:27:07,447--> 00:27:09,438
Then, and Morgan?
How is it that explains that?

242
00:27:09,687--> 00:27:11,598
She was with a depression.

243
00:27:12,767--> 00:27:18,319
She could have committed suicide her,
he/she wants was in the projecto or not.

244
00:27:20,047--> 00:27:23,881
I will tell you a thing,
but you cannot say anybody.

245
00:27:24,087--> 00:27:25,918
It is secret.

246
00:27:27,807--> 00:27:29,763
Morgan was pregnant.

247
00:27:30,007--> 00:27:32,441
Then the depression.

248
00:27:32,727--> 00:27:36,356
You are too involved in this.
You have of relativizar the things.

249
00:27:56,527--> 00:27:57,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:28:01,207--> 00:28:02,276
He/she signs here.

251
00:28:06,447--> 00:28:07,800
Here you have.

252
00:28:12,327--> 00:28:13,442
Are you well?

253
00:28:16,607--> 00:28:17,926
Do you feel well?

254
00:28:20,047--> 00:28:25,121
Yes, excuse.
I am only a little tense.

255
00:28:30,647--> 00:28:32,365
It should be some "caught."

256
00:28:43,807--> 00:28:45,798
How is it that are going those potatoes?

257
00:28:54,487--> 00:28:55,442
A delicacy.

258
00:28:55,727--> 00:28:59,606
And the funniest
it is that me nor I prove.

259
00:29:00,687--> 00:29:03,679
The funniest
it is that nor you try to be humble.

260
00:29:04,327--> 00:29:08,525
- Mindy.
- Yes. Hello, father.

261
00:29:08,687--> 00:29:10,678
- What is that he/she happens?
- Teacher Eastbrook.

262
00:29:10,847--> 00:29:14,806
Did you know the girl that was died?
The rumors here for the kitchen

263
00:29:14,967--> 00:29:18,960
they say that she walked put
in a sect with drugs.

264
00:29:19,487--> 00:29:24,436
They are same coscuvilheiros. Nobody
he/she takes her malts of the kitchen seriously.

265
00:29:24,607--> 00:29:29,362
You want to put in cause the moral carácter
of the people that make your food?

266
00:29:29,527--> 00:29:34,396
You are right. But I knew her, yes.
We were not arrived.

267
00:29:34,567--> 00:29:37,001
We had a chair committees, only that.

268
00:29:37,727--> 00:29:41,322
- Are you well?
- I am.

269
00:29:41,487--> 00:29:44,718
I only walk a little concerned.

270
00:29:47,367--> 00:29:51,519
Do you know him/it what should do soon?
A family dinner.

271
00:29:51,927--> 00:29:55,363
He/she doesn't please to see me you to eat
these refeic.es all alone one.

272
00:29:55,847--> 00:29:57,200
Soon.

273
00:29:59,087--> 00:30:02,159
- Good-bye.
- I adore you, filhota.

274
00:30:06,287--> 00:30:11,964
I think are to hide him/her
a lot of thing. She doesn't know about anything.

275
00:30:12,767--> 00:30:16,760
I feel a lot. He/she doesn't compete to me.
She is not my daughter.

276
00:30:37,647--> 00:30:39,922
Hello, everything well?

277
00:30:41,047--> 00:30:42,321
How is it going that?

278
00:30:43,527--> 00:30:49,443
I already made the research, and I found
very frightening scenes.

279
00:30:49,607--> 00:30:51,040
What is that you discovered?

280
00:30:51,247--> 00:30:53,807
He/she has to do with the leader of the sect,
twenty years ago.

281
00:30:54,007--> 00:30:59,639
- Yes, I already know about his existence.
- But do you know like him entered in the country?

282
00:30:59,807--> 00:31:00,922
Which do know his aspect is?

283
00:31:01,527--> 00:31:02,516
How is it going that?

284
00:31:02,727--> 00:31:05,878
I wait that the meeting of to speak
of what it happened. Morgan yesterday.

285
00:31:06,047--> 00:31:07,878
Personal, I have to dispatch me.

286
00:31:08,047--> 00:31:11,596
The boss will be harmed with me
for being me to neglect so much.

287
00:31:11,807--> 00:31:14,002
I ended for finding some
informac.es on this leader.

288
00:31:14,287--> 00:31:15,800
Good! Who is?

289
00:31:16,087--> 00:31:19,079
This type here. See.
Owen Quinlin.

290
00:31:20,327--> 00:31:21,840
He/she has a strange aspect.

291
00:31:22,047--> 00:31:24,515
Were you. does he/she wait that? Of the winner
of a beauty contest?

292
00:31:24,767--> 00:31:28,396
He/she waited a type of Chinese Christ.

293
00:31:28,567--> 00:31:32,685
Quinlin passed some time in China,
but it disappeared there are about 20 years.

294
00:31:33,367--> 00:31:34,959
Because?

295
00:31:36,847--> 00:31:38,246
Was he where?

296
00:31:38,687--> 00:31:42,600
Nobody knows for sure, but the type
he/she appeared in American soil again.

297
00:31:42,767--> 00:31:44,598
Here, in our town.

298
00:31:45,567--> 00:31:48,923
- Is it later?
- It was how Eastbrook said.

299
00:31:49,127--> 00:31:51,721
"A man's sect,
it can be the religion of other."

300
00:31:52,047--> 00:31:53,799
He began to seek followers.

301
00:31:54,127--> 00:32:00,043
Women. Young pure like Kwan Yin
and ready for if they give him/her.

302
00:32:01,847--> 00:32:06,079
I don't notice because it is that he would gather
followers to imitate Kwan Yin.

303
00:32:06,327--> 00:32:08,557
Because, alegadamente,
she had a god's power.

304
00:32:08,807--> 00:32:10,763
He should want to capture that power.

305
00:32:11,367--> 00:32:14,723
It is that Kwan Yin became pregnant
before marrying.

306
00:32:15,327--> 00:32:18,000
The father had her forbidden of loving one
lower class man.

307
00:32:18,247--> 00:32:20,442
When he/she discovered
that she will give. light a bastard son

308
00:32:20,647--> 00:32:23,639
he/she was so rioted by his/her only daughter
to stain the good name of the family,

309
00:32:23,927--> 00:32:25,645
that perforated him/her the eyes
and it tore him/her the womb

310
00:32:25,887--> 00:32:29,402
to kill him/her the body, the soul and the son.

311
00:32:35,167--> 00:32:36,441
Just as Morgan.

312
00:32:36,647--> 00:32:41,243
Morgan committed suicide because of one
sect disappeared 20 years ago?

313
00:32:41,407--> 00:32:42,681
That abnormal!

314
00:32:45,367--> 00:32:48,200
This can seem strange,
but he/she walked to research in a book

315
00:32:48,487--> 00:32:55,040
on Kwan Yin and I found the drawing
of a girl to be died.

316
00:32:57,687--> 00:32:59,439
He/she was Morgan.

317
00:32:59,647--> 00:33:02,525
- What?
- No. That is impossible.

318
00:33:02,687--> 00:33:03,961
Do you find?

319
00:33:04,207--> 00:33:07,165
- He/she lets to see me. Am I also there?
- I wait albeit yes. We will see.

320
00:33:08,847--> 00:33:10,439
I want to show you a thing.

321
00:33:16,167--> 00:33:18,397
That is frightening.

322
00:33:18,607--> 00:33:20,996
Did you receive that, like this for mail?

323
00:33:22,607--> 00:33:28,000
If to cassette he/she has same material
fasten, we will have the best presentation.

324
00:33:28,487--> 00:33:35,279
For speaking in that... Me .s times I am one
little nervous to speak in public.

325
00:33:35,567--> 00:33:37,842
- We have to solve that.
- He/she hears there...

326
00:33:38,167--> 00:33:41,603
All of the weeks you walk to the jumps
. front of a thousand of people.

327
00:33:41,887--> 00:33:43,957
That is very different.

328
00:33:44,367--> 00:33:47,916
That is not my face.
There, I am masked.

329
00:33:48,087--> 00:33:50,442
I am the Urso Saltitao.

330
00:33:50,647--> 00:33:53,400
Remain silent, I will begin this to run.

331
00:33:57,647--> 00:33:59,000
Ok, fork.

332
00:34:07,967--> 00:34:10,800
I already watched a porn film
that began like this.

333
00:34:15,247--> 00:34:16,475
What does he be to say?

334
00:34:29,247--> 00:34:32,159
All are dead.
They committed suicide all!

335
00:34:32,487--> 00:34:34,443
Massacre him/it happened even.

336
00:34:34,767--> 00:34:35,756
Because?

337
00:34:38,367--> 00:34:39,561
I don't know.

338
00:34:39,927--> 00:34:43,715
But I think were to try
to arrive to something higher.

339
00:34:45,567--> 00:34:48,001
He/she wants to say... it is the foundation
of all of religi.es, right?

340
00:34:48,167--> 00:34:50,362
We approximate ourselves of God
or of that that we adored.

341
00:34:50,687--> 00:34:55,124
They were to adore
the statue of a dead Chinese.

342
00:34:55,327--> 00:34:57,557
I think are us
to approximate of any thing.

343
00:34:57,727--> 00:34:59,604
How like this?
To approach that?

344
00:34:59,807--> 00:35:05,564
- I don't know... of the truth.
- The truth? On the one what?

345
00:35:06,287--> 00:35:07,766
We should go to the temple.

346
00:35:55,887--> 00:35:58,685
That is a very nice ranch
to serve as stage to a massacre.

347
00:35:58,887--> 00:36:01,003
- That is enormous.
- He/she is quiet.

348
00:36:10,007--> 00:36:12,362
There is no reason to laugh of Kwan Yin.

349
00:36:13,527--> 00:36:19,557
It was the agony and no the laughter
that he/she had room in this sacred ground.

350
00:36:19,847--> 00:36:22,281
Excuse.

351
00:36:25,567--> 00:36:26,886
That scene more marada.

352
00:36:27,327--> 00:36:30,080
If you don't know how to behave as adult,
he/she is outside, as the dogs.

353
00:36:37,527--> 00:36:39,916
What is that he/she brings you
to Kwan Yin's temple?

354
00:36:40,127--> 00:36:43,039
We are to do research
for a work.

355
00:36:43,327--> 00:36:46,524
- And who are you?
- I am the monk Gee Ming.

356
00:36:47,007--> 00:36:51,717
I am the guardian and protector
of the souls that wander for the temple.

357
00:36:51,927--> 00:36:53,997
- Beautiful job.
- He/she is quiet.

358
00:36:54,607--> 00:36:56,279
Because it is that they need
of proteccao?

359
00:36:56,447--> 00:36:59,678
Because there are people that wants to abuse
of Kwan Yin's power.

360
00:37:01,607--> 00:37:03,359
Is he/she to refer Owen Quinlin?

361
00:37:04,167--> 00:37:09,241
Mine, he is dead.
Us vimo-Io to die in the cassette.

362
00:37:09,487--> 00:37:11,364
The death is a revolving door.

363
00:37:12,687--> 00:37:14,643
Kwan Yin proved quite so.

364
00:37:15,887--> 00:37:17,240
Accompany me.

365
00:37:29,447--> 00:37:31,961
This is to be
a strange little bit.

366
00:37:32,967--> 00:37:39,406
Quinlin judged that if it sacrificed him/her
his/her people, she would give him/her his/her power.

367
00:37:40,607--> 00:37:42,279
It will be that was for that
what did Morgan die?

368
00:37:42,607--> 00:37:45,041
Good. Then, did he return?

369
00:37:48,287--> 00:37:49,561
That doesn't scare me.

370
00:37:50,207--> 00:37:53,836
Quinlin judged that he/she had obtained
the power, but something ran badly.

371
00:37:54,047--> 00:37:56,686
It is now he is sanded,
and we are home of him.

372
00:37:56,887--> 00:38:00,323
Personal, what is that?
What ray is that?

373
00:38:00,527--> 00:38:02,119
There is still more to learn.

374
00:38:11,247--> 00:38:13,363
My beautiful geisha...

375
00:38:14,047--> 00:38:16,277
I will take this to show.

376
00:38:47,367--> 00:38:49,039
She got scared...

377
00:38:54,167--> 00:38:58,445
The acolytes' spirits
they are arrested here.

378
00:38:58,647--> 00:39:02,925
The death arrested them
instead of freeing.

379
00:39:03,807--> 00:39:08,119
Alex, uses your machine
and ribbon some pictures.

380
00:39:08,567--> 00:39:09,886
You think he gets
to feel the spirits?

381
00:39:10,047--> 00:39:11,196
He doesn't seat anything.

382
00:39:11,567--> 00:39:15,162
Get.
And I think also get.

383
00:39:17,807--> 00:39:19,286
Feel...

384
00:39:24,007--> 00:39:25,759
Ribbon .quilo.
He/she photographs a thing of those.

385
00:39:26,127--> 00:39:29,642
They go. front. It is a lot fastens.
P.e-you under her!

386
00:39:52,647--> 00:39:55,445
Because it is that seek
the answer the these quest.es?

387
00:39:56,247--> 00:39:57,760
To discover the truth.

388
00:40:01,167--> 00:40:05,797
Which truth?
The one of Quinlin or your?

389
00:40:05,967--> 00:40:07,400
Of the one what is it that is to speak?

390
00:40:07,607--> 00:40:09,882
Some thing invoked of turn
the evil spirits.

391
00:40:11,087--> 00:40:14,602
He is still thirsty
for Kwan Yin's power.

392
00:40:17,607--> 00:40:20,075
He/she waits there...
How is it that we see each other free from him?

393
00:40:20,287--> 00:40:21,720
He is to hide some thing.

394
00:40:21,887--> 00:40:23,240
- Do you find?
- Let us go.

395
00:40:30,487--> 00:40:31,806
Personal!

396
00:40:38,007--> 00:40:39,918
Personal, this doesn't have grace.

397
00:40:41,407--> 00:40:43,716
Your involvement
it is not coincidence,

398
00:40:43,927--> 00:40:46,122
and your presence became dangerous.

399
00:40:51,207--> 00:40:55,086
They should leave
and never again here to return.

400
00:40:59,767--> 00:41:01,280
Wait. What is that there is there?

401
00:41:01,927--> 00:41:06,682
The Past and the Future.
The conflict and the resolution.

402
00:41:06,847--> 00:41:10,601
I have to go.
His power is more and more strong.

403
00:41:11,447--> 00:41:13,517
They are going walking that I already pick you.

404
00:42:21,567--> 00:42:22,966
My lady...

405
00:42:27,847--> 00:42:29,724
...is it true?

406
00:42:38,287--> 00:42:39,845
Release me!

407
00:42:42,567--> 00:42:43,841
What ray?

408
00:42:45,247--> 00:42:46,362
Shit!

409
00:43:10,527--> 00:43:16,363
Help!
Help! Let to do!

410
00:43:20,967--> 00:43:23,003
My God, we were also here.

411
00:43:23,647--> 00:43:25,126
- Let to do!
- Alex, is going to the right.

412
00:43:25,447--> 00:43:26,800
- He/she goes until. door.
- He/she goes until. door.

413
00:43:26,967--> 00:43:31,722
Alex, walks here. He/she gives me your hand.
He/she gives me your hands. We go, it jumps!

414
00:43:33,487--> 00:43:35,682
- Are you well?
- My God, my God...

415
00:43:35,927--> 00:43:37,918
We go for here. We go for here.

416
00:43:38,407--> 00:43:40,875
- This place is too strange.
- What is that he/she happened?

417
00:43:41,327--> 00:43:44,399
Hallelujah!
It seems that passed there hours.

418
00:43:44,607--> 00:43:45,642
Mindy?

419
00:43:48,687--> 00:43:51,247
Are Mindy, well?

420
00:43:52,007--> 00:43:53,360
I am.

421
00:43:56,607--> 00:44:00,077
That rich projecto. Fork, Bears.

422
00:44:25,727--> 00:44:28,844
- What ray is that happened there inside?
- Of the one what is it that are to speak?

423
00:44:29,007--> 00:44:30,918
Mindy, know very well
of what it is that am to speak...

424
00:44:31,127--> 00:44:34,324
- No. I don't know.
- Are you to hide some thing?

425
00:44:36,847--> 00:44:39,407
Hear well, Gee Ming said

426
00:44:39,607--> 00:44:41,279
that what was exhumed
he/she cannot return.

427
00:44:41,447--> 00:44:44,086
Yes, that I noticed.
Quinlin returned.

428
00:44:44,567--> 00:44:47,764
Do you know him/it what? I think he counts
the same tretas

429
00:44:47,927--> 00:44:51,203
to any one that will beat him/her. door.

430
00:44:51,447--> 00:44:52,766
He/she was Morgan.

431
00:44:53,367--> 00:44:56,518
When she committed suicide,
he/she opened him/her the door for him to return.

432
00:44:57,887--> 00:45:01,800
- She became pregnant out of the marriage.
- I am to see. Just as Kwan Yin.

433
00:45:02,007--> 00:45:05,204
Now, he comes to try to finish
that that began 20 years ago.

434
00:45:09,487--> 00:45:14,641
That this scene is sanded. "Scooby Donate."
Even if leads. chair,

435
00:45:14,807--> 00:45:19,483
I have more important things
to do in the life.

436
00:45:23,207--> 00:45:24,720
I think Mindy is right.

437
00:45:26,567--> 00:45:29,400
"I think Mindy is right."
Didn't you hear?

438
00:45:29,567--> 00:45:32,639
- I am out!
- Alex, and our work?

439
00:45:33,007--> 00:45:35,043
That the work is sanded.
Make him/it without me.

440
00:45:35,327--> 00:45:38,399
They will complain about me. Eastbrook,
do what understand. He/she finished.

441
00:45:38,567--> 00:45:42,276
All are scared, Alex.
But we are not to flee.

442
00:45:42,487--> 00:45:46,639
- Then, they are all some idiots.
- He/she sees there as speeches.

443
00:45:46,847--> 00:45:51,682
I see him/it that, his/her idiot,
pretentious and fake?

444
00:45:51,887--> 00:45:54,685
He/she goes but it is to drink your soy milk,

445
00:45:54,887--> 00:45:57,447
p.e a music in the iPod

446
00:45:57,727--> 00:46:00,799
and it will start there the day to order
messages. girlfriend.

447
00:46:01,007--> 00:46:03,157
"Oh my love, taste so much of you."

448
00:46:03,607--> 00:46:07,839
What was?
Not even you arrive for her!

449
00:46:08,047--> 00:46:11,119
What is that you will do,
does he/she tell me, his/her son of the mother?

450
00:46:11,287--> 00:46:12,720
He/she will sand you, Alex.

451
00:46:12,887--> 00:46:15,355
He/she has pity. I should be the only
that you still didn't eat.

452
00:46:17,247--> 00:46:20,205
Stop with that, boys.
Stop.

453
00:46:22,847--> 00:46:25,441
You can do what to please.

454
00:46:25,607--> 00:46:27,598
Eastbrook won't annoy us
therefore.

455
00:46:27,807--> 00:46:29,798
But I will extricate this.

456
00:46:36,087--> 00:46:37,805
It is exactly like that.
He/she flees while it is time.

457
00:46:37,967--> 00:46:39,366
He/she will seek you!

458
00:47:44,047--> 00:47:45,196
Fork Bears!

459
00:47:52,527--> 00:47:55,837
Hello Urso Bradley.

460
00:47:57,847--> 00:47:59,565
Did you miss?

461
00:48:10,807--> 00:48:11,956
Today not.

462
00:48:13,927--> 00:48:15,360
They are bedtimes.

463
00:48:49,007--> 00:48:51,840
Thank you.
I am the Saltatory Bear.

464
00:49:14,367--> 00:49:18,121
He wants you to be with him.
No lho give.

465
00:49:19,287--> 00:49:21,084
He is the instrument of the death.

466
00:49:22,407--> 00:49:24,443
It is the return of the evil.

467
00:50:11,407--> 00:50:16,197
- Excuse.
- You nailed me a death fright.

468
00:50:16,967--> 00:50:20,562
Do you have time to speak?
It is on Morgan.

469
00:50:22,207--> 00:50:25,836
He/she didn't know more with whom speaks
on this without seeming crazy.

470
00:50:27,207--> 00:50:29,926
It is not worthwhile to doubt
of the mental sanity of the other ones.

471
00:50:32,367--> 00:50:34,961
I found this in Morgan's things.

472
00:50:40,527--> 00:50:42,324
Is Morgan, right?

473
00:50:44,247--> 00:50:45,202
Yes.

474
00:50:48,087--> 00:50:50,920
You saw her
in the day in what that happened?

475
00:50:51,567--> 00:50:58,040
Yes, she was strange.
He/she was very calm.

476
00:50:58,727--> 00:51:01,764
He/she had the red eyes,
as if he/she had state to cry.

477
00:51:03,287--> 00:51:05,596
I thought that was for her to be depressed.

478
00:51:08,687--> 00:51:12,646
- Her father is an idiot.
- What is that you want to say with that?

479
00:51:12,847--> 00:51:16,317
He told him/her that he/she was embarrassed
of being her father.

480
00:51:16,767--> 00:51:20,077
Such and which like Kwan Yin.
Rejected by the father.

481
00:51:20,327--> 00:51:21,885
It was the opportunity of Quinlin.

482
00:51:23,647--> 00:51:25,444
He/she excuses...
He/she forgets what I said.

483
00:51:28,407--> 00:51:29,806
I also found this.

484
00:51:33,647--> 00:51:34,875
Where?

485
00:51:36,487--> 00:51:38,205
In the box of her bijutarias.

486
00:51:40,887--> 00:51:43,924
The mother called and she asked me
that arranged her things.

487
00:51:44,687--> 00:51:45,915
I saw this and...

488
00:51:46,127--> 00:51:47,480
...he/she knew that didn't belong to Morgan.

489
00:51:48,007--> 00:51:50,475
But as it is that you know
what did have to do with her death?

490
00:51:52,407--> 00:51:54,637
That followed me for the room.

491
00:51:55,727--> 00:51:57,001
What?

492
00:51:58,127--> 00:52:03,042
He/she judged that he/she had kept him/it,
and that appeared in my pocket.

493
00:52:03,447--> 00:52:08,123
I made the same again,
and he/she appeared in my neck.

494
00:52:09,527--> 00:52:13,315
I threw him/it for the window and it went back to me.

495
00:52:16,807--> 00:52:18,763
I will see what get to discover.

496
00:52:24,367--> 00:52:26,722
- Yes?
<i> - Hello, Fetish.</i>

497
00:52:26,887--> 00:52:29,685
- Hello, Mrs. Farrell.
<i> - As you are?</i>

498
00:52:29,847--> 00:52:33,078
- I am well.
<i> - fortunately.</i>

499
00:52:33,287--> 00:52:35,403
I already have her things
almost arranged.

500
00:52:35,767--> 00:52:39,919
<i> We want to bury her with </i>
<i> her necklace. Did you already arrange him/it?</i>

501
00:52:40,047--> 00:52:41,765
I didn't see him/it.

502
00:52:42,127--> 00:52:45,278
<i> please, he/she sees if you find him/it.
It is very important for us.</i>

503
00:52:45,487--> 00:52:47,079
I will see what get to do.

504
00:53:48,207--> 00:53:49,162
Enter.

505
00:53:52,927--> 00:53:53,882
Hello.

506
00:53:57,407--> 00:53:59,125
He/she wanted to speak with you the alone ones.

507
00:54:01,367--> 00:54:03,403
It is because of the projecto, Mindy.

508
00:54:06,007--> 00:54:08,237
I think are to exaggerate.

509
00:54:08,527--> 00:54:10,006
What do you be to say?
There are people to die.

510
00:54:10,167--> 00:54:13,125
Exacto, Mindy. And I don't want
that happens to us.

511
00:54:13,687--> 00:54:15,757
I think didn't owe
to take this forward.

512
00:54:17,327--> 00:54:20,683
He/she has grace.
You said that supported me.

513
00:54:20,847--> 00:54:22,326
I support you.

514
00:54:23,287--> 00:54:26,245
If you want to go, it goes.
He/she disappears, it goes!

515
00:54:26,407--> 00:54:27,920
What do want you to say with that?

516
00:54:28,127--> 00:54:30,561
He/she is going to another group,
because I will move forward with this.

517
00:54:44,927--> 00:54:47,805
- We see each other thereabout.
- Yes, maybe.

518
00:55:33,767--> 00:55:36,679
Fetish! Fetish, are you there?
He/she opens the door!

519
00:58:04,047--> 00:58:06,356
I only wanted the truth.
I think deserve that.

520
00:58:06,527--> 00:58:09,519
You make idea of the one that is increase
without anything to know of my mother?

521
00:58:09,727--> 00:58:11,126
Of the one what do you be to speak?

522
00:58:11,407--> 00:58:14,479
Of your wife.
I know about Kwan Yin.

523
00:58:14,727--> 00:58:16,558
I know that she was part of the sect.

524
00:58:19,887--> 00:58:23,596
Did you think that I will feel?
I didn't have him/it done.

525
00:58:23,767--> 00:58:26,042
But now I can do-Io,
because you disappointed me.

526
00:58:27,567--> 00:58:32,846
- He/she was only to try to protect you.
- That? Of my mother?

527
00:58:35,367--> 00:58:40,885
- How is it that you discovered?
- In the chair of the Prof. Eastbrook.

528
00:58:41,047--> 00:58:44,119
I made a work
on him it massacres of Kwan Yin.

529
00:58:46,047--> 00:58:47,958
He/she seemed that some thing pulled me.
Now, I already know because.

530
00:58:48,127--> 00:58:48,957
What?

531
00:58:49,167--> 00:58:52,603
I am going to the end with this, alone.
I am very close, father.

532
00:58:52,887--> 00:58:56,118
It is for some to happen thing
very bad and I can avoid her.

533
00:58:56,327--> 00:59:00,240
I think was that that the mother
he/she was to do or to try.

534
00:59:00,487--> 00:59:01,920
How is it that she died?

535
00:59:05,967--> 00:59:07,161
How?

536
00:59:07,967--> 00:59:12,802
- It was stabbed itself own.
- Where?

537
00:59:13,767--> 00:59:15,803
In the throat.

538
00:59:18,527--> 00:59:19,846
I have to go.

539
00:59:26,087--> 00:59:29,124
- Because it is that you didn't tell me?
- I thought didn't compete me.

540
00:59:29,287--> 00:59:31,960
Besides, you didn't get to impede her.
Because it is that you judge that I get?

541
00:59:32,167--> 00:59:35,557
Mindy, wait.
Mindy, please waits.

542
00:59:40,687--> 00:59:46,284
Did he/she also know about my mother, it is not?
He/she could have told me.

543
00:59:46,447--> 00:59:49,678
Do you think that left you satisfied?
Don't try to make a mistake.

544
00:59:49,847--> 00:59:52,156
You are not the person type that gives up,
just because they tell you for doing.

545
00:59:52,367--> 00:59:55,598
Somebody should have myself statement some thing,
don't find?

546
00:59:55,847--> 00:59:57,565
Like this, there would not be people to die.

547
00:59:57,727--> 01:00:00,560
Mindy, if you go with this forward
the close can be you.

548
01:00:00,887--> 01:00:02,957
He/she judged that was everything a myth.

549
01:00:04,087--> 01:00:07,875
I was to try to refrain the imagination
of an entrepreneur.

550
01:00:08,607--> 01:00:12,759
There are things that one can study,
to understand the religion.

551
01:00:13,487--> 01:00:18,481
But he/she believes, there are things
in that nor we should play.

552
01:00:18,687--> 01:00:21,997
He/she should have impeded me
of beginning this projecto.

553
01:00:22,207--> 01:00:28,680
He/she could not stop.
He is part of your family history.

554
01:00:29,287--> 01:00:34,042
Well, that means that am me
that I have to stop Quinlin.

555
01:00:39,207--> 01:00:41,846
- Then?
- We have that to help.

556
01:00:42,087--> 01:00:44,078
He/she gives me time
to investigate Kwan Yin

557
01:00:44,247--> 01:00:46,283
and he/she comes to have with me to my cabinet
in half hour.

558
01:00:52,367--> 01:00:56,076
Hello, I have to close the house.
Can you pick me in one hour?

559
01:00:56,327--> 01:01:00,161
I am not able to, Cassie. You can arrange
another person to accompany you?

560
01:01:00,487--> 01:01:03,797
He/she hears... I know that we have to talk
on some things.

561
01:01:04,007--> 01:01:05,759
<i> AND I adored to hear, but...</i>

562
01:01:06,287--> 01:01:08,642
<i> he/she did Want to speak to you </i>
<i> of some things.</i>

563
01:01:08,807--> 01:01:11,241
<i> I Have to treat of some things </i>
<i> for the classes.</i>

564
01:01:11,487--> 01:01:13,205
<i> does he/she Have to be now?</i>
<i> This night?</i>

565
01:01:13,367--> 01:01:17,201
- Yes.
- Ok. Do you tie me later?

566
01:01:17,487--> 01:01:19,478
- Ok.
<i> - it is well.</i>

567
01:01:41,887--> 01:01:43,206
Do you have one second?

568
01:01:49,247--> 01:01:54,480
You don't need to give more explicac.es.

569
01:01:55,607--> 01:02:00,283
This is really a madness.
All have the nerves in bang.

570
01:02:03,087--> 01:02:05,647
I think I know in a way of stopping.

571
01:02:07,287--> 01:02:10,643
I discovered that he/she was my mother
that was in the center of the circle.

572
01:02:13,087--> 01:02:14,645
In that cassette.

573
01:02:15,367--> 01:02:19,155
She didn't submit because he/she knew something
that the another didn't know.

574
01:02:19,367--> 01:02:22,006
It was for that that Quinlin
he/she didn't have success.

575
01:02:22,607--> 01:02:26,316
- Because... but she committed suicide.
- Yes, but it was not for him.

576
01:02:26,487--> 01:02:28,557
Her faith-Io to impede
that something bad happened.

577
01:02:29,807--> 01:02:31,559
Therefore, I have a plan.

578
01:02:35,887--> 01:02:38,355
- Did you end there in the machine of the yogurts?
- Yes.

579
01:02:38,687--> 01:02:40,678
- Did you restore the palhinhas?
- Yes.

580
01:02:40,887--> 01:02:42,764
It is that you always forget.

581
01:02:43,767--> 01:02:46,076
Then, it tells me as they ran
the things with Bailey.

582
01:02:46,607--> 01:02:48,006
- Good night.
- Good night.

583
01:02:53,247--> 01:02:55,158
Is there anybody?

584
01:03:23,927--> 01:03:27,124
I don't think so there are like this so much people
disposed to commit suicide.

585
01:03:28,607--> 01:03:32,395
It is not necessary. An is enough...

586
01:03:35,047--> 01:03:37,800
...and I think I know
as to bring of turn.

587
01:04:06,967--> 01:04:08,082
Shit!

588
01:05:00,487--> 01:05:04,036
- Cassie?
- Cassandra?

589
01:05:33,607--> 01:05:34,881
He/she releases me!

590
01:05:36,247--> 01:05:38,078
Still no terminámos.

591
01:05:39,207--> 01:05:41,721
- Cassandra?
- Cassie?

592
01:05:56,367--> 01:05:59,165
- Bailey.
- What is that?

593
01:06:00,607--> 01:06:03,167
It is a long history,
but this is not good.

594
01:06:08,087--> 01:06:09,805
You are the sure that you know
what are to do?

595
01:06:20,007--> 01:06:23,556
"To invoke Kwan Yin's spirit,
it is necessary the sacrifice of the souls.

596
01:06:23,887--> 01:06:28,244
"A pure soul that follows the steps
of Kwan Yin to the hell

597
01:06:28,407--> 01:06:30,443
"and return as a god.

598
01:06:30,607--> 01:06:36,557
"But that person should possess
Kwan Yin's old amulet.

599
01:06:36,807--> 01:06:38,638
"In agreement with the sacred book..."

600
01:06:48,047--> 01:06:49,719
I have state. he/she waits of Mindy.

601
01:06:51,127--> 01:06:55,643
- Cassie! Cassie, where are you?
- He/she waits, we won't seek at random.

602
01:06:55,807--> 01:06:57,001
What do suggest?

603
01:06:57,247--> 01:06:58,839
We have to find Gee Ming.
He knows any thing.

604
01:06:59,047--> 01:07:01,402
You remember the room
what didn't he want to show us?

605
01:07:01,607--> 01:07:03,006
I felt that there was there something.

606
01:07:03,487--> 01:07:06,285
He/she waits there, Mindy,
do you sit down or do you know?

607
01:07:06,567--> 01:07:11,004
I saw. I know. I saw me own
to pull my eyes.

608
01:07:11,207--> 01:07:16,600
- Balls. And do we want there to return?
- We have that finding. Walk.

609
01:07:20,047--> 01:07:24,359
Diane? Diane! My God,
what is that happened?

610
01:07:24,567--> 01:07:27,035
- Mindy...
- What does she have?

611
01:07:27,207--> 01:07:31,359
She will sacrifice him.

612
01:07:31,527--> 01:07:36,840
But without the sacred prayer,
everything is in vain.

613
01:07:38,247--> 01:07:41,159
The sacred book...

614
01:07:41,367--> 01:07:44,643
He/she saved Kwan Yin.
He can save Mindy...

615
01:07:44,927--> 01:07:47,487
...and to kill the spirit of Quinlin.

616
01:07:49,567--> 01:07:51,956
P.e end to this.

617
01:08:18,327--> 01:08:19,396
Mindy.

618
01:08:23,327--> 01:08:24,760
Alex is dead.

619
01:08:24,927--> 01:08:29,717
All died. The Fetish, Morgan,
Teacher Eastbrook...

620
01:08:29,847--> 01:08:33,237
- And Cassandra?
- I didn't see her.

621
01:08:36,167--> 01:08:37,919
Does he now walk behind us, it is not?

622
01:08:39,327--> 01:08:41,045
- Only of me.
- No.

623
01:08:56,167--> 01:08:57,236
Died before time.

624
01:08:57,367--> 01:08:58,561
My heart and my soul
they are pure.

625
01:08:58,687--> 01:09:00,803
My body is dead,
but my soul lives.

626
01:09:31,367--> 01:09:34,279
Don't let to die her.
Not without the sacred book.

627
01:09:40,767--> 01:09:41,961
Bailey?

628
01:10:28,967--> 01:10:30,195
No!

629
01:10:34,807--> 01:10:38,277
Cassie! Cassie! Cassie!

630
01:10:42,247--> 01:10:46,525
Cassie, you are well.

631
01:10:47,367--> 01:10:49,517
I think so.

632
01:10:52,207--> 01:10:53,686
What was?

633
01:10:54,407--> 01:10:57,717
- I think he will kill myself.
- Who?

634
01:10:59,767--> 01:11:03,476
We go, we got.

635
01:11:04,647--> 01:11:09,004
Calm.
We only have to do one more thing.

636
01:11:15,807--> 01:11:18,799
Gee Ming, is arrived the hour.

637
01:11:27,967--> 01:11:29,082
Here you are you.

638
01:11:30,487--> 01:11:31,840
He/she moves me that tail, mine!

639
01:11:32,047--> 01:11:33,526
- Do you seat the energy?
- That that is sanded.

640
01:11:33,687--> 01:11:37,805
To me no longer you deceive me. He/she gets up then
the tail and it takes me to the sacred books!

641
01:11:43,207--> 01:11:44,481
Mindy!

642
01:12:06,807--> 01:12:08,320
The pages are all burned.

643
01:12:52,607--> 01:12:55,280
Mindy, cannot be to speak seriously.
We leave of here.

644
01:12:55,447--> 01:12:56,482
Let us go.

645
01:12:57,967--> 01:13:02,085
This puts an end to everything.
It is alone one more sacrifice Kwan Yin.

646
01:13:04,607--> 01:13:06,598
I think your plan won't result.

647
01:13:08,167--> 01:13:10,237
What is that you want to say with that?

648
01:13:10,447--> 01:13:13,086
We only needed Kwan Yin's prayer.

649
01:13:13,767--> 01:13:15,997
Quinlin burned the sacred books.

650
01:13:16,407--> 01:13:19,717
- What?
- We are sanded.

651
01:13:24,647--> 01:13:27,115
- Mindy! Mindy!
- He/she is my father.

652
01:13:37,207--> 01:13:40,836
Father, Teacher Eastbrook is dead.

653
01:13:41,207--> 01:13:45,166
- He/she brought this of her cabinet.
- What is this?

654
01:13:52,047--> 01:13:55,164
- It is Kwan Yin's prayer.
- What does this mean?

655
01:13:55,407--> 01:13:57,716
We have to recreate the sacrifice.

656
01:13:59,127--> 01:14:01,243
We will use the corpses,
as in the cassette.

657
01:14:01,487--> 01:14:04,843
If it sacrifices me, I can snatch
the power of Kwan Yin to Quinlin.

658
01:14:20,687--> 01:14:23,599
That that if it sacrifices
and to read Kwan Yin's prayer

659
01:14:23,767--> 01:14:27,282
it will follow their steps to the hell
and he/she will return as a god.

660
01:14:29,287--> 01:14:31,517
We will make this,
before it lacks us the courage.

661
01:14:31,687--> 01:14:35,726
That person has to have the amulet.
Wait... we needed the amulet.

662
01:14:35,967--> 01:14:37,446
He/she is at the other room,
where I saw you before.

663
01:14:37,607--> 01:14:38,562
I go buscá-Io.

664
01:14:44,847--> 01:14:46,883
Was it of this amulet that you needed?

665
01:14:47,127--> 01:14:49,766
My God! Cassie! No!
What are you to do her?

666
01:14:50,967--> 01:14:53,037
Mindy, what do we do?
Cassie!

667
01:14:53,607--> 01:14:55,245
He/she says the prayer, Mindy.

668
01:14:55,447--> 01:14:59,326
Cassie, have to say these words.
He/she repeats mentally.

669
01:14:59,487--> 01:15:01,876
My body is dead,
but my soul lives.

670
01:15:02,047--> 01:15:03,526
I am Kwan Yin, died before time.

671
01:15:03,687--> 01:15:05,598
You are to give beginning
to a world totally new.

672
01:15:05,767--> 01:15:07,246
Cassie, says the ray of the words!

673
01:15:07,407--> 01:15:09,045
"My heart and my soul
they are pure." He/she repeats, Cassie.

674
01:15:09,207--> 01:15:10,606
- Please...
- Cassie, repeats!

675
01:15:10,767--> 01:15:15,204
- Cassie, speech.
- He/she will sand you!

676
01:15:21,887--> 01:15:22,956
No!

677
01:15:24,487--> 01:15:25,602
Cassie!

678
01:16:00,687--> 01:16:04,475
- I don't submit.
- I force you.

679
01:16:04,687--> 01:16:06,598
It is not worthwhile.
Before I want to die as the other ones

680
01:16:06,767--> 01:16:08,564
and to be here prey for the eternity.

681
01:16:09,047--> 01:16:13,325
Then, just as Kwan Yin,
you will die your father's .s hands.

682
01:16:16,087--> 01:16:18,885
Kwan Yin's heart
it was pure as yours.

683
01:16:19,047--> 01:16:23,962
But with this amulet, I obtain
the power that your mother denied me.

684
01:17:08,687--> 01:17:11,485
<i> Mindy. Mindy.</i>

685
01:17:14,527--> 01:17:18,122
<i> I Lament so much </i>
<i> to have left you alone.</i>

686
01:17:18,447--> 01:17:23,157
<i> I saw you.</i>
<i> All my life saw these moments.</i>

687
01:17:23,447--> 01:17:27,486
<i> it is always wanted to tell you </i>
<i> that feel your lack.</i>

688
01:17:27,967--> 01:17:29,400
<i> I Adore you.</i>

689
01:17:30,487--> 01:17:33,365
<i> AND it is for that that you will live.</i>

690
01:17:34,247--> 01:17:37,478
<i> Kwan Yin's amulet </i>
<i> it saved your soul that is pure.</i>

691
01:17:37,647--> 01:17:42,880
<i> your body will live, thanks
. your delivery and to your sacrifice.</i>

692
01:18:04,207--> 01:18:08,564
- He/she excuses, father.
- Because?

693
01:18:13,807--> 01:18:15,081
My God...

694
01:18:20,567--> 01:18:21,761
Bailey.

695
01:18:22,447--> 01:18:23,596
Bailey?

696
01:18:35,007--> 01:18:36,281
Cassie...

697
01:18:47,487--> 01:18:53,039
<i> it finishes Like this one more chapter </i>
<i> of Kwan Yin's legend.</i>

698
01:18:53,367--> 01:18:58,760
<i> instead of losing, </i>
<i> one more life survived.</i>

699
01:18:59,367--> 01:19:02,404
<i> But the last book </i>
<i> it is still for writing </i>

700
01:19:02,687--> 01:19:07,363
<i> because the natural human tendency
to do ligac.es to the past </i>

701
01:19:07,847--> 01:19:10,645
<i> he/she will never stop existing.</i>

702
01:19:21,367--> 01:19:25,360
