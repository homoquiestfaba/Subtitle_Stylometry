1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,619
Yo, it's Nick.

2
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,755
     Photographer,
     artist, entrepreneur.

3
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,757
Stop that shit.

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,359
- Nick, it's Lily.

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,094
             Again.

6
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,063
     Umm, it's been almost
     an hour, I need you

7
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:34,133
    to come out and grab me.

8
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,153
      No, I'm on the list!

9
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,655
        I'm on the list!

10
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,434
              Hey.

11
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,170
      - How come you never
      answer my texts?

12
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,872
            - Sorry.

13
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,542
     - I thought you'd have
     something more to say

14
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,712
  than sorry, but I guess not.

15
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,615
     Hey, are you coming to
     TJ's tomorrow night?

16
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,816
            - TJ's?

17
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,552
          - Yeah, TJ.

18
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,654
      God, I want you guys
      to like each other.

19
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,590
      - We do, Bea, I do.

20
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,692
     - So you'll be there?

21
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,327
    - Well, I mean I'll try.

22
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,295
    I already promised that
    I'd drop by this thing--

23
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,563
          - With Nick?

24
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,867
 Yeah, Lily, you're a fallback.

25
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,587
         - Hello, Lil.

26
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,890
       - I need a drink.

27
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:40,192
      - I'm a little
      busy at the moment.

28
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,462
       - I could jump in
       front of a bus.

29
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,932
        - I'll be there.

30
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,575
  - Can you spare some change?

31
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,644
     - I'm the one that
     needs change, mister.

32
00:02:58,646 --> 00:02:59,912
          - Fuck you!

33
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,954
          - Guess who?

34
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,590
  - I didn't see you come in.

35
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,760
 - Now what fun would that be?

36
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,906
- Let's
   start from the beginning.

37
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:52,978
    - Umm, I'm Lily, I'm
    23, I umm, just recently

38
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,650
    graduated from FIT, and
    I have this best friend,

39
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:02,721
      she's kind of my
      favorite thing in--

40
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,157
- Let's
      talk about Nick.

41
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,428
     - Umm, I don't know,
     he's kind of amazing.

42
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,731
   He's probably the sweetest
   guy I've ever met.

43
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,000
- What
       about your job?

44
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,168
   - I mean, it's in fashion.

45
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,903
        So, that's good.

46
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,805
             And...

47
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,941
      I'm learning a lot.

48
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,878
- Good morning.

49
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,222
       You don't have AC.

50
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,758
           - Thanks.

51
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,029
 Why are we talking like this?

52
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,798
   - This is how we talk now.

53
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,071
          I need food.

54
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,973
              Now.

55
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,965
       - What do you want
       for breakfast?

56
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,068
       I guess anything.

57
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,970
           Pancakes.

58
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,510
             - So.

59
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,245
 What are you wearing tonight?

60
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,980
             - Huh?

61
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,616
     - Thank you for that.

62
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,150
         You are going.

63
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,585
            - Am I?

64
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,888
      - If I have to club
      and sack you myself.

65
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,056
        - How much fun?

66
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,892
          - Extremely.

67
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:47,893
        Astonishingly...

68
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,695
        Breathtakingly.

69
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,998
            - Fancy.

70
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,546
         I gotta work.

71
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,849
 - When are you going to quit?

72
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:14,219
   - I can't, I have to
   maintain lavish lifestyle.

73
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,557
              Mmm.

74
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,317
- So, I heard about last night.

75
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,820
       That wasn't nice.

76
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,955
  - What exactly did you hear?

77
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,224
        - You and Nick.

78
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,095
      I mean I guess it's
      just inevitable.

79
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,999
       Eventually we all
       just drift apart.

80
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,304
   Because like, that's what
   the universe is doing.

81
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,007
           You know?

82
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,976
      Drifting, fading...

83
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,046
       Dying, that's it.

84
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,150
      And then one day you
      wake up and realize

85
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,953
   you're dating a
   meteorite, when all a girl

86
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,955
       really wants is
       to be whisked off

87
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,758
 by a shooting star, you know?

88
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,226
      - I thought they
      were the same thing?

89
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,428
        - The point is.

90
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,863
 You have the dream, we all do.

91
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,997
      And eventually,
      you have to grow up

92
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,034
    and settle for something
    more realistic.

93
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,737
      Like, a quarry rock.

94
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,776
Or worse, like the Hideki rock.

95
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:18,977
      Like the kind you
      find in one of those

96
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,212
    sad in-flight magazines.

97
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,314
      - Yeah, you lost me.

98
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,352
 - That's life for most people.

99
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,122
       I mean, not ours
       of course, but...

100
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,725
        For most people.

101
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,894
     - Yeah, but I mean...

102
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,899
     What actually gets
     like, better with age?

103
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,268
           - Hmmm...

104
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,438
 My vintage motorcycle jacket.

105
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,941
            - Right.

106
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,717
    - Oh, so Jess posted
    pictures of last night.

107
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,721
      And it appears you
      checked in at Canopy

108
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:06,424
      around 11, eat, and
      then you were back

109
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,060
    in BK 30 minutes later,
    it all makes sense now.

110
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,295
      You know, you really
      should work on

111
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:13,064
     a more socially viable
     virtual reputation.

112
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,033
  - No wait, what makes sense?

113
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,370
       - Nick, all over
       this model chick.

114
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,341
 That's why you left, isn't it?

115
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,943
           - No, I...

116
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,448
       No, I mean, that's
       like, his job.

117
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,286
      - Yeah, but it's the
      same one every time.

118
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,991
  - Umm, Ben isn't here is he?

119
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,092
      - I don't know,
      he's separated now,

120
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,027
  he kinda does what he wants.

121
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,235
          - Good day?

122
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,302
       - Umm yeah, it's
       actually really--

123
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,138
            - 2,100.

124
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,407
   - Uh-huh, and what's
   Donna doing on the ticker?

125
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,877
   - Up actually, it's 18.25.

126
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,345
  - Uh-huh, and the inventory?

127
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,880
      - In transit with an
      estimated delivery--

128
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,148
     - Can I get some Coke?

129
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,183
       - 15 minutes ago.

130
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,566
- Hey baby, it's Nick.

131
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,235
    Listen, I feel like such
    shit about last night,

132
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,838
  like seriously, shit just...

133
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,173
     I don't know, shit
     just got mighty crazy,

134
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,341
     you know how fucked up
     my schedule can get,

135
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,244
       but you know, work
       now, live later.

136
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,814
   I know you probably looked
   hot as shit last night.

137
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,482
    Tell you what, uhh,
    drop by my show tonight,

138
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,819
  kay, give me a ring, we
  can make up for last night.

139
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,860
        - So, shall we?

140
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,863
       - I can't, and I
       want to see Nick.

141
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,832
    - Are you being serious?

142
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,001
     - Yes, but, Beatriz
     is having people over,

143
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,071
   so we could go over
   there and still have fun.

144
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,074
          Oh, come on.

145
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,910
            Please?

146
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,979
            Please?

147
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,948
            - Fine.

148
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,460
          I'd fuck me.

149
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,363
        - I'd fuck you.

150
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,133
           - Really?

151
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,905
  - Well yeah, if I was a guy.

152
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,907
       I'd stick my penis
       in your vagina.

153
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,442
            Totally.

154
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,545
        - Well, thanks.

155
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,089
   - -And she's in the
   shower, completely naked,

156
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,591
          and she's...

157
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,094
    and she's just, you
    know, waiting for Nick,

158
00:14:56,096 --> 00:15:00,064
     to go and switch over
     his film or whatever

159
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,902
       bullshit excuse he
       made up to leave,

160
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:08,973
    and then it wasn't until
    delivery guy turns up

161
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,077
that she thought wait a minute,

162
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,381
   I wonder if Nick's
   actually arrived back yet?

163
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,451
     And of course, he was
     nowhere to be found.

164
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,488
   - This is supposed to be
   something about yourself.

165
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,124
     - It is, I was there.

166
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,992
    - You are an absolute--

167
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,128
     He was, he was trying
     to get material

168
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,297
for his portfolio, because
he's trying to find and agent--

169
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,665
            - Lily!

170
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,367
     It was material for
     his fucking wank bank!

171
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:41,072
  - It was, why are you trying
  to make excuses for him?

172
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,041
     - He's a very
     serious photographer.

173
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,043
       And he had to go
       because he had...

174
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,946
   I, no, but, really,
   really, it was very sweet,

175
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,548
   and he felt very bad that
   he had to leave afterwards

176
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,584
      and he came back and
      he made me dinner

177
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,421
     and he apologized, it
     was really very sweet,

178
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,090
     and so you know, those
     kind of things hap--

179
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,226
             Whoa.

180
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,462
     Oooo, secret, secret.

181
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,464
 - Uh no it's, I have something

182
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,333
  really exciting to tell you.

183
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,335
     - Really, what is it?

184
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,137
     - It's wonderful news.

185
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,505
- Alright,
    can everyone quiet down

186
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,007
      a little bit please?

187
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,241
 - Promise you won't freak out.

188
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,010
       - Okay, I mean...

189
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,112
  - Everyone shut the fuck up!

190
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,519
            - Okay.

191
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,423
            So, yes.

192
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,460
       I have some really
       exciting news.

193
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,998
       I am pleased to
       say, my time here,

194
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,135
    in this wonderful city,
    has been quite amazing.

195
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,004
      And it wouldn't have
      been half as amazing

196
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,206
       without you guys
       being part of it.

197
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:54,345
      So, it is with great
      sadness that I say,

198
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:59,150
  I will not be taking
  residence here much longer.

199
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,188
     I have a job in London
     with my dad's label

200
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,160
   and I am, sadly, leaving.

201
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,264
         In seven days.

202
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,302
       This is my last
       week in New York.

203
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,040
     - I'm excited for you
     man, that's awesome.

204
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,243
     I'll miss you, though.

205
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,584
        - Just a minute!

206
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,167
      - That is really
      crazy but, what else

207
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,169
       would you expect?

208
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,438
          That's that.

209
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,840
      - Yep, I guess she
      just needed change.

210
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,310
- I bet she won't even miss us.

211
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,147
     - You'd be surprised.

212
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,849
        - Are you okay?

213
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,452
       You look like your
       dog just died.

214
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,457
      - No, no, I'm fine.

215
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,496
     - Hey, how's it going?

216
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,900
         We'll see ya.

217
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,957
- When
       did you meet Kat?

218
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,992
       - Four years ago.

219
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,995
   We were roommates at FIT.

220
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,663
- How
       would you describe

221
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,865
      your time together?

222
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,868
  - Well, I think she actually
  learned a lot from me.

223
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,937
             So...

224
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,708
  I mean, I'm not saying that
  Kat like, isn't smart, but,

225
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,010
     she just might be
     kind of disadvantaged.

226
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,845
     From all of the drugs.

227
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,849
- Is this a
  period that she's overcome?

228
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,453
         - Yes and no.

229
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,390
     It's hard to tell with
     those kinds of people.

230
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,425
- You
       don't seem to have

231
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,561
     a high opinion of her.

232
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,930
         - No, it's...

233
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,635
    Okay, so, this is gonna
    sound really horrible,

234
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,838
      but umm, when I say
      eight and a half,

235
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,441
      Kat thinks I mean
      penis size, so yeah,

236
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,810
        it's pretty hard
        to talk with her

237
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:24,348
about anything that's, anything.

238
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,818
- I'm assuming
  you're not excited for her.

239
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,355
       of people to fuck,
       that's awesome.

240
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,824
- So you
   don't feel happy for her?

241
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,961
    - I mean it's not like
    it even fucking matters.

242
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,732
       I don't need her.

243
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,002
- Why didn't
  you tell her off right then?

244
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,072
   - God, can we please talk
   about something else?

245
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,440
- Okay.

246
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,042
 So you hit a car with a beer.

247
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,544
      Tell us about that.

248
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,550
 - I was imagining Kat's head.

249
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,460
        - What is this?

250
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,062
          Sunglasses?

251
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,966
      - It's a long story.

252
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:28,806
   I flew over a few blocks
   to Agatha's peaceful tree,

253
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:32,410
     hard-working bird, but
     lately I've sucked,

254
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,412
       and I need to pull
       my shit together.

255
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,848
   And tell Agatha thank you,
   for I owe you my life.

256
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,984
Tell me something good, tell me

257
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,019
     you brought me coffee.

258
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,888
          - I did not.

259
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,793
    - I genuinely hope this
    is some sort of phase.

260
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,165
      Awesome, you're
      hilarious, now get.

261
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,844
        - There you are.

262
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,952
     So we should, I mean,
     I can understand

263
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,020
      how you're feeling.

264
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,189
    - I don't think you do.

265
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,594
     - I know it sucks, but
     this is huge for me.

266
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,529
  You have to understand that.

267
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:26,864
      You're going to
      start your own line,

268
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,633
   it will be fucking
   awesome, I know it'll be.

269
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,969
   This is going to work out.

270
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,472
  - Can you just postpone it?

271
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,242
       I can't, they'll
       get someone else.

272
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,112
      This is a career
      move, how could you

273
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,547
      not understand that?

274
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:44,515
          - I get it.

275
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,251
  - Then what's the big deal?

276
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,489
 You're going to be big, Lily.

277
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,791
I knew it since the day we met.

278
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,494
          No, really.

279
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,831
  We'll make the best of this.

280
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,901
           - I know.

281
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,238
      - I hope I can make
      you feel better.

282
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,611
     I want you to come to
     this art show tonight.

283
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,013
  - Okay, I'll think about it.

284
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,083
      - There are a lot of
      interesting people.

285
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,522
    - Umm, so, the 17th,
    that's a Friday, right?

286
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,190
            - Yeah.

287
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,592
     More than enough time
     for us to have fun.

288
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,128
    It'll be like
    sophomore year in Cabo.

289
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,296
         Remember Cabo?

290
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,902
     - Oh, I'm sorry, that
     was the text, not you.

291
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,848
- Yo, little mama!

292
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,816
- Hey, where
   you been, how's your girl?

293
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,653
- Right, right
   right right, cool cool.

294
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:58,188
      Listen, I met this
      guy, total cokehead

295
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,924
    but super down-to-earth,
    he's got this

296
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:03,227
   huge Paris-based line,
   it's like crazy high-end.

297
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,962
      Anyway I'm shooting
      his look book

298
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,031
      and we totally hit
      it off, he takes me

299
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,333
   to some fucking penthouse
   and we do some coke,

300
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:10,834
       I tell him that
       you're in fashion

301
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:16,073
  so I got you like a
  shitload of contacts, and...

302
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,341
            - Okay.

303
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,976
- I was really
     just thinking of you,

304
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,277
   and you know, I just want
   to respect you and shit,

305
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,347
   and I don't think I'm
   doing a good job at that.

306
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:30,321
 You gotta excuse me, I am a
 high mother fucker right now.

307
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,072
- You don't seem
  excited about the art show.

308
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,908
      - Well that's
      really unfortunate.

309
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,844
- What do
   you expect to say to Kat?

310
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,246
       - I mean that's if
       she even shows up.

311
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,016
- She said she'd
  make the best of things.

312
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,251
        - Yeah, for her.

313
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,221
  Doesn't exactly include me.

314
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,125
- I
      believe you and Kat

315
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,394
have a history at art galleries?

316
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,068
         - Yeah, we do.

317
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,404
- Tell me about it.

318
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,239
            - Umm...

319
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,176
   I don't know, we would...

320
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:32,850
     We'd like always umm,
     go as characters.

321
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,287
     Like we'd, pretend
     to be French students

322
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,889
 and then anyone you would meet

323
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,258
     at the gallery, you'd
     keep on going with it.

324
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,964
   I mean Kat always thought
   it was fucking hysterical.

325
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,732
              I...

326
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,902
       There was this
       one time we umm...

327
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,805
    We ended up back at this
    photographer's apartment

328
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,740
    and like, I don't know,
    we were pretending

329
00:27:56,742 --> 00:28:00,277
  to be British but my accents
  are really, really bad.

330
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,946
      And I'm pretty sure
      he know that it was

331
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,115
    complete bullshit,
    because I kept on like,

332
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,685
just saying these insane things.

333
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,454
   Like, righto and cheeri-o.

334
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:12,322
             Umm...

335
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,959
    I don't know, Kat
    couldn't stop laughing.

336
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,863
  But he might have been too
  fucked up to really notice.

337
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,085
     - Dude, not supposed
     to touch the artwork.

338
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,090
          - Of course.

339
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,194
      I feel really stupid
      right now, sorry.

340
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,929
          - It's fine.

341
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,531
      Are you having fun?

342
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,434
  - Yeah, it's a great space.

343
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,536
         - Yeah, yeah.

344
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,073
    What about the artwork?

345
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,408
       What do you think?

346
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,911
   - It's pretty terrifying.

347
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,880
            - Yeah.

348
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,016
        What about this?

349
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,985
       This is beautiful.

350
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,622
    - Yeah I mean I guess...

351
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,626
   Well you know style-wise,
   I can see that but,

352
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,631
       I don't know, it
       just feels kind of

353
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,967
       predictable, like
       how do you know

354
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:12,135
     that it's not a ripoff
     of something else?

355
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:17,541
 I think that if something has
 meaning, then it's beautiful.

356
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,944
    But that's just my take.

357
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:22,045
- I don't know, it kind of feels

358
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,248
     like all style to me.

359
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,985
     - Who's to say style
     can't have substance?

360
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,058
     Did you come here
     with someone tonight?

361
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,464
        What do you do?

362
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,432
            - Guess.

363
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,534
            - Uh...

364
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,637
       You're a waitress.

365
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,275
   - I can't believe you said
   that, umm no acutally,

366
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,976
        I am in fashion.

367
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,478
        - Oh, of course.

368
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,247
   - I work at this boutique
   in Soho right now,

369
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,548
         I Don't Know.

370
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,616
        - I don't know?

371
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:05,188
   No, that's the name of the
   boutique, I Don't Know.

372
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,657
            - Right.

373
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,125
        Do you like it?

374
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,028
        - I don't know.

375
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,098
     No, I mean it's, it's
     fine, it's whatever,

376
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
          it's a job.

377
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,203
      I guess I just
      would really rather

378
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:22,506
       own my own store.

379
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,042
     - So does that mean
     that you don't create

380
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,677
         your own work?

381
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,949
  - No, I mean I tried, didn't
  really work out perfect.

382
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,985
   I guess I'm not very good.

383
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,955
     - I'm sorry but that
     is complete bullshit.

384
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,657
     I mean why else would
     you into that medium?

385
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,527
   To collect a bunch of old
   shit from other people,

386
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,295
        that's not art.

387
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,564
    I mean, the whole reason
    why you got into fashion

388
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,634
    was to create something,
    to leave it behind.

389
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,703
     I mean that's why we
     all get to be artists.

390
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,139
     You know what I think?

391
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,342
    I think that you're
    afraid of being judged.

392
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,277
       That has something
       to do with it.

393
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,081
             What?

394
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,016
       Tell me I'm wrong.

395
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,089
        - You're wrong.

396
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:13,757
            - Right.

397
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,158
         No, no, right.

398
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,059
      Coming from the
      girl that just said

399
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:19,129
  that my painting was empty.

400
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,398
              Hi.

401
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,433
           I'm Henri.

402
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,103
      - I've been looking
      for you everywhere.

403
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,437
             - Hi.

404
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:28,472
             - Kat?

405
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,474
   - No, no sorry, I'm Lily.

406
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,441
           This is--

407
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:32,476
             - Kat.

408
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,011
       Nice to meet you.

409
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,746
           - You too.

410
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,365
- We're going back
       to  baby,

411
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,666
       Henri, what's up?

412
00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:01,738
     This fine lady is uh,
     Valentina, I love it.

413
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,775
       Two of them, nice
       bro, very nice.

414
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:07,210
      So, are they coming
      wi--actually,

415
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,112
    let's let the ladies
    make up their own minds,

416
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,781
  'cuz females, they're
  independent and intelligent,

417
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,050
       I'm Colin by the
       way, how are you?

418
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,052
            - Uhh...

419
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:19,589
      - Okay, how about
      you go get us a cab?

420
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,690
         - Absolutely.

421
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:21,324
           Love you!

422
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,726
           Big cock.

423
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,099
     - Okay, so that's
     someone that you know.

424
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,068
      - Yeah, yeah it is.

425
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,069
- Regrettably.
-          - Wow.

426
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:32,803
          - Goodness.

427
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:34,271
            - Yeah.

428
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,374
Hey, let me give you my number.

429
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,610
        - Okay, umm....

430
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,746
      - Here, let me uh...

431
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,315
        Let me help you.

432
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:49,286
 Do you want to come to a party

433
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:52,122
 and you can bring your friend?

434
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,225
       - Oh, shit, no, I
       work really late.

435
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,198
        - Not this late.

436
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,867
- Let's go!

437
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,369
       Come on, let's go.

438
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,705
      Call her, call her.

439
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,744
  - That's just fucking weird.

440
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,813
       - It was kind of--

441
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,316
   Okay it is a little weird.

442
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,785
It's a little weird.

443
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,659
       - As if I would be
       impressed by that,

444
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:32,562
    I mean you know who my
    godfather is, seriously.

445
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:34,865
        Where we off to?

446
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,766
     - I'm gonna head home.

447
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,235
             - Boo!

448
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:39,369
            - What?

449
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,537
       I had a fun night.

450
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,905
       I just want to go
       home and crash.

451
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,540
             - Lil.

452
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,408
 - I'll see you in the morning.

453
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,477
    Try to come before noon?

454
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:51,181
- Sure, fine, whatever you need.

455
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,384
    See you in the morning.

456
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,364
       - What time is it?

457
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:15,899
      - It's before noon.

458
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,838
      Why is everything
      so god damn bright?

459
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,775
  - Because this is what we
  normal people call day time.

460
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,014
          - Come down.

461
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,783
 - I've got some of your
 shit, I packed it up for you,

462
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,485
  I thought you might need it.

463
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:36,653
           - Pass it.

464
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,788
       Bring it with you.

465
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:50,900
           - Selling?

466
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,702
             - Yep.

467
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,840
          All of this.

468
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,812
       So, I have a bunch
       of other things

469
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:06,416
  I was going to sell, but I
  think you should have them.

470
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,519
      - Thanks, as long
      as I can sell them.

471
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,289
    - Why would you do that?

472
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,924
  - Jeez, I was just kidding.

473
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,729
       - So, how's Nick?

474
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,532
        - Nick is good.

475
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,833
        - You never told
        me what happened

476
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,869
     after he stood you up.

477
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,313
     - You're selling this?

478
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,448
     - It's lovely, but I
     don't wear it enough.

479
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,584
 - I bought this for you, Kat.

480
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:42,852
           - Did you?

481
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,955
  - It's funky and I like it.

482
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,857
 - Then keep it, I don't care.

483
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,926
      - You keeping this?

484
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,828
       - Happy Christmas.

485
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,096
          - Kat, I...

486
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,999
      - So the total comes
      to 954 dollars.

487
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,835
            - Super.

488
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,579
- Let's
    talk about your career.

489
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,615
        - What about it?

490
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,051
- Do you enjoy
   where you're working?

491
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,887
    - Umm, am I a masochist?

492
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,790
- Is that what
   you consider Agatha to be?

493
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,960
           - Umm, no.

494
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,929
   I think the only thing
   that could possibly bring

495
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:29,366
  her pleasure is black
  leather against her thighs.

496
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,904
- How do you see
  yourself when you're old?

497
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,408
- Don't you want
  to create your own line?

498
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,944
      - Well yeah, but, I
      don't really think

499
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,946
  that's an option right now.

500
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,481
       I mean if you know
       anyone who wants

501
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:47,817
to give money to a 23-year-old,
please let me know.

502
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,421
- Then would
    you say you're stuck?

503
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,891
         - No, umm....

504
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,595
  God, you're making this out
  so much worse than it is,

505
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,063
          it's just...

506
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,400
   Okay, so maybe the
   boutique is cold and dead

507
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,902
      and lifeless, but
      I mean, I am making

508
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,604
    a lot of great
    contacts that I can use

509
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,806
       later in my life.

510
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,941
- Do you
      really mean that?

511
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,913
             - No.

512
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,183
- Let's
      talk about Henri.

513
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,019
            - Let's.

514
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,054
- Do you
   want to make love to him?

515
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,190
            - Umm...

516
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,961
     Maybe, sure, why not?

517
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,632
- What do
     you look for in a guy?

518
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:39,736
     - Well, a career in
     fashion or art, film,

519
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,205
     photography, music, I
     mean I can't help it.

520
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:44,774
    I like guys who create.

521
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,845
      a fear of expressing
      yourself creatively?

522
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,114
             - Wow.

523
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,950
       Umm, I just went
       to fashion school,

524
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,720
       so I don't have a
       problem creating.

525
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:01,024
    I mean, like, it's just
    not my thing right now.

526
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:02,992
- Uh-huh.

527
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,162
           - Really.

528
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,668
You know, I think I've made some

529
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,037
      really bold choices
      with my life.

530
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:26,709
- Lily!

531
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,912
- Lily, it's Nicky
   here, get your ass up.

532
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:30,146
     You got plans tonight?

533
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,080
      - What's the matter?

534
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:31,881
- My boy Dan is deejaying

535
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,583
     at the club right now.

536
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:34,951
       Fucking DJ Dan,
       you met him what,

537
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:35,985
        like five times?

538
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,153
     Come on, come through.

539
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,288
           - Text me.

540
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,290
- Yeah,
     fashion girl by day...

541
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,079
       - You look so hot.

542
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,749
    - Yeah, I thought you
    had a learning disorder.

543
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,851
           Oh my god.

544
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,855
   I have not stopped
   thinking about that night.

545
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,224
    - We don't have to talk
    about that, really.

546
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,761
       - I have to get
       this off my chest.

547
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,897
      Those models,
      they're all so tall,

548
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:58,768
 and beautiful, and flawlessly
 have those perfect--

549
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,671
  Whenever I was with them,
  I was just thinking of you.

550
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:03,272
      - Wait, I thought
      there was just one.

551
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,774
         - Oh, come on.

552
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,275
      If it rains, then
      everything gets wet.

553
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,177
  Does it really matter if it
  rains again an hour later?

554
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,379
            - What?

555
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,080
             Nick?

556
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:15,985
     - You know what I'm
     trying to say is that,

557
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:20,123
like a really, really soft man.

558
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,991
     - Wait, you slept with
     one of your models?

559
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,426
      - Oh my god, none of
      them compare, Lily,

560
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:25,828
  that's what I'm trying, mm--

561
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,164
              Hey.

562
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:31,067
      Remember what I said
      about eye contact.

563
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,898
- Hey, make some waffles.

564
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,001
 - I can't, I have to go home.

565
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:14,103
      - No, come on, make
      some waffles first.

566
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,973
    - I have to go to work.

567
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:18,908
        - Well then, I'm
        coming with you.

568
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,209
            - Nick.

569
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:21,244
           - Come on!

570
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:22,311
     How much do you work?

571
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,384
    - No, I don't think so.

572
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,289
            - Jesus.

573
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,225
    There's so much day,
    see what you're wasting?

574
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,961
         - Wait, what?

575
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,006
         What is this?

576
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,410
        - That is a bra.

577
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,146
      Oh Jesus Lily,
      could you please not

578
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,081
    start this this morning?

579
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,986
           Oh my god.

580
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,390
       - You know what,
       I am taking this,

581
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:10,026
    because this is my face!

582
00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:12,528
       - Oh Jesus Christ.

583
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,200
          - Fuck you.

584
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:32,982
              Oh!

585
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:35,952
             Shit.

586
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,074
- Hi.

587
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,275
             - Mom?

588
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:00,543
I'm not available

589
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,911
     to take your call,
     please leave a message

590
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:04,046
  and I will get back to you.

591
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,491
- Are you ready?

592
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:27,436
   So, let's talk about Nick.

593
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:33,242
     - Yeah, well that was
     obviously humiliating.

594
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:38,114
- Then why
    do you put up with him?

595
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:41,217
     - I don't know, umm...

596
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,654
 I just want to be with someone

597
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:47,523
      who could do so
      much better than me.

598
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,926
- Doesn't that
   put you in low regard?

599
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:53,996
 - No, it actually means that
 I have really high standards.

600
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:55,331
- I see.

601
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,934
- Yeah, glad we cleared that up.

602
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,137
- You
       kind of seem to be

603
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:02,438
   going through a tailspin.

604
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,408
 - Well, call it what you will.

605
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,978
- Where
      are your parents?

606
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,716
            - Umm...

607
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,420
       They're not here.

608
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:20,423
    They moved, they have
    better things going on.

609
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:26,395
- Don't you
    feel like going home?

610
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,397
        - Do you want to
        get out of here?

611
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,616
- No, I didn't know with the...

612
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,553
 I think I just didn't get it.

613
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,721
       - I understood it.

614
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:34,090
           - Did you?

615
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,491
      - I did, and it was
      fucking appalling.

616
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:36,258
             - Wow.

617
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:36,859
            - Yeah.

618
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:37,393
             - Wow.

619
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:38,561
            - Yeah.

620
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:39,762
       - Tell me what you
       really thought.

621
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,464
     - Do you have a light?

622
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:43,365
          - Uh, yeah.

623
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,667
     - So this is like
     what you're into then,

624
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:47,470
 like, standing around every...

625
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:48,704
   - Yeah every night, yeah.

626
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,272
     - Every single night.

627
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,278
    - I mean, I thought it
    was pretty interesting.

628
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,849
  I don't know, I guess I just
  didn't quite understand it.

629
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,352
          - Nice ring.

630
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:07,890
    - Oh, umm, thanks, it's
    actually pretty cool,

631
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,792
      it was my grandma's.

632
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,193
       My grandpa brought
       it back for her

633
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:13,496
       from World War II.

634
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:16,532
I'm like really into old things.

635
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:17,666
 There's actually, there's this

636
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,502
      amazing vintage
      place near my house

637
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:21,403
      and on the weekends
      sometimes I go there

638
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,406
       and I can just
       rummage for hours.

639
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:25,808
     - Yeah, you find some
     really cool stuff,

640
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,143
        don't you Lily?

641
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:28,344
            - Yeah.

642
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,713
     - You're a really
     great vintage shopper.

643
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:31,747
    - I guess, I don't know.

644
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:32,882
            - Yeah.

645
00:52:32,884 --> 00:52:35,217
       She found this
       amazing coat once.

646
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:36,252
   Do you remember the coat?

647
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:36,785
- What coat?

648
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:38,154
          - What coat?

649
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:38,888
      - Okay, it's time
      to hear this story.

650
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:39,822
             - Yes.

651
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,224
- Okay, so Lily found this coat,

652
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:43,792
      this time she bought
      this coat, she spent

653
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:46,896
     probably about 350
     dollars on this coat,

654
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:48,831
        which, you know,
        is a really fine

655
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,399
    amount of money to
    spend if it's you know,

656
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:53,936
   one of a kind, vintage,
   lovely, old, unique piece.

657
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:56,438
And then a couple of weeks later

658
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,707
       we were walking
       down Fifth Avenue,

659
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,710
   and we see the same coat,

660
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,245
- No, the same coat?
-   - In the window

661
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:04,713
  of a department store, yeah.

662
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,315
       And it was on sale
       for about maybe

663
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,884
a third of what she paid for it.

664
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:12,388
   She just got ripped off
   by some flea market twat.

665
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:18,494
 Pretty fucking bad mistake
 for a fashion student to make.

666
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,797
  - Hey, do you know if
  there's a bathroom in here?

667
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,933
    - Oh, I don't think so.

668
00:53:23,935 --> 00:53:25,834
             - Oh.

669
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:28,737
     Okay, I, well, I'm
     gonna try to go find--

670
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,973
          Don't move.

671
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,441
            - Okay.

672
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:34,510
     - I'll be right back!

673
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:16,852
             - Yo!

674
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:19,455
       - Someone's in the
       fucking bathroom.

675
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,328
- So uh,
    where's your girlfriend?

676
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,866
- I don't know,
  she's never been like this.

677
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,702
             - So?

678
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:07,803
        What did you do?

679
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:11,340
      - Fuck off, I
      didn't do anything!

680
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,510
     She's so overdramatic.

681
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,645
       She's adorable
       though, isn't she?

682
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,347
           - She is.

683
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,618
             - Hey.

684
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,919
- Hello.

685
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,522
        - You will never
        guess who I saw.

686
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:27,389
             - Who?

687
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:29,958
       - Your ex, Erasus.

688
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,763
      I mean, you remember
      Erasus, don't you?

689
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,333
         - I do, Lily.

690
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,701
    - He was such a racist.

691
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:40,102
      - He wasn't racist.

692
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:41,570
      - Then what was he?

693
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:43,872
         - An asshole.

694
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,074
      - I mean I guess
      you wouldn't really

695
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:46,108
     remember that though,
     since you were

696
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,077
just blacking out all the time.

697
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:51,980
          - Excuse me?

698
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,382
 - I mean, I'm just saying that

699
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:55,718
       you were into some
       really dark shit.

700
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:59,688
     - Yeah, I was, thanks
     for bringing it up.

701
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,029
  - So uh, buried or cremated?

702
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,998
- Buried.
-        - Cremated.

703
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,578
       - The way I see
       it you can choose.

704
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,913
    You can either be a
    turban, or a bobby pin.

705
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,949
       I mean, sure one
       is fun and flashy,

706
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,917
       but it goes out of
       style like that.

707
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:31,620
    Bobby pins are a bore,
    but they're dependable.

708
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:33,021
     They get the job done.

709
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,090
  No fussing with the trends,

710
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:38,527
    just invisible fixtures,
    doing their job.

711
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,896
 And like, I know a lot of guys

712
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,865
    who secretly wish they
    could borrow hairstyles

713
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:44,900
      or styles from a
      genre not their own.

714
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,668
           - Uh-huh.

715
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,704
       - They can't, like
       the lawyer, who is

716
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:50,105
     afraid of what the
     firm's senior partners

717
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:52,408
      or even his cleaning
      lady might think.

718
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,743
       Will they wonder,
       is he a pedophile?

719
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:55,978
           Or worse?

720
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,413
        Like a hipster?

721
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:58,981
           - Aaargh!

722
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,887
  - Are you having a bad day?

723
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,452
- Hello?

724
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,887
 - Hey, hey, hi, Henri it's...

725
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,758
        Uh, yeah, sorry.

726
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,860
             Umm...

727
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,964
       Yeah, so I got
       out of work early,

728
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,900
     do you want to like
     grab a drink or some--

729
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,936
             Yeah.

730
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:56,104
     No, that sounds great.

731
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:57,940
I can be over there in a little,

732
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,975
I just have to drop by my place.

733
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,947
             Yeah.

734
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,916
    Okay, I'll see you soon.

735
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,519
              Bye.

736
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,677
             - Hey.

737
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,091
              Hey.

738
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,830
             - Hey.

739
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:37,899
   Yeah man, yeah yeah yeah,
   I'm just finishing up,

740
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:39,968
   and then I'm out the door.

741
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,238
         Alright, yeah.

742
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,242
       Sorry, I gotta go.

743
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:52,714
     But uh, I mean you can
     stay here if you want.

744
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,251
             Or...

745
01:00:56,919 --> 01:01:00,088
         Come with me.

746
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,057
          - Have fun?

747
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,992
 - What are you talking about?

748
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:40,128
      - Henri texted, said
      he was with you.

749
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,065
       - We ran into each
       other after work.

750
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,100
          - How cute.

751
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:47,869
      You're like a little
      porcelain doll.

752
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,743
     - So, what do you want
     to get into tonight?

753
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,212
         I'm not tired.

754
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,185
    - Hmm, now that the
    night's properly fucked,

755
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:05,320
   I'm gonna bug off to bed.

756
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,289
      - It's not even 10.

757
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,494
 - I'll see you tomorrow night.

758
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,169
- What
     are you smiling about?

759
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:28,009
- I've never been
finger-painted by a guy before.

760
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,179
- Are you in love?

761
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:35,016
        - Ummm, I guess.

762
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:39,287
- Are you
     bothered by the fact

763
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,823
  that Kat only has two days?

764
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,393
           - Really?

765
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:16,057
  - So where the fuck's Henri?

766
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,129
             - Hey.

767
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,800
  Glad you decided to stop by.

768
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:25,400
      - Sorry we're late.

769
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,135
     No, welcome, welcome.

770
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,804
   I mean we barely started.

771
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:31,573
    Here, looks like you
    could use one of these.

772
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:36,011
     Well listen, if things
     get too extreme,

773
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:37,546
     I want you to tell me.

774
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,514
I feel responsible for you two.

775
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:42,884
    - Okay, yeah, seems
    like pretty crazy here.

776
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:46,021
      - Good, well, enjoy.

777
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:01,036
     - So my mother
     thinks that it's like

778
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:04,873
     a fun mother-daughter
     bonding thing.

779
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,943
  She should take me to go
  and see a psychic with her.

780
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:09,544
    Like, I know, seriously,
    I mean the last--

781
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,413
    I mean, I don't want to
    go see a psychic anyway,

782
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:14,249
    let alone with my
    mother, can you imagine?

783
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:17,419
  I mean what might, like what
  might come out, you know?

784
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:18,954
        In front of her,
        and I don't want

785
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:21,423
   to know her stuff,
   either, I mean seriously,

786
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:23,558
      my mother's lovely.

787
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:30,932
    - So you're in fashion?

788
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:32,534
         - Yeah, I am.

789
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,136
      - Oh, I think
      fashion's pointless.

790
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,906
       - Two, three more?

791
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:39,641
          Three more.

792
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:41,576
   - Oh, here, I'll help you.

793
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:47,449
       - You didn't even
       finish that one.

794
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,053
             - Hey.

795
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,488
             - Hey.

796
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,526
       - You having fun?

797
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:02,130
       - Yeah, this is an
       amazing apartment.

798
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,202
       I really like the
       Christmas lights.

799
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:10,238
            - Yeah.

800
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:16,311
  You know, you can tell me
  if Colin's being an asshole.

801
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,147
             - No.

802
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:21,449
No, I mean he's just, you know,

803
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:24,519
      like, really witty.

804
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,058
 Okay, he's kind of an asshole.

805
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,359
      - Yeah, yeah he is.

806
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,194
            Mmm-hmm.

807
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,366
       So uh, you know
       how to make these?

808
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:40,235
   - I think I can handle it.

809
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:41,069
            - Yeah?

810
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:42,037
           - Mmm-hmm.

811
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:43,538
           - Alright.

812
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,616
          - Say when.

813
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:57,118
         - When, when!

814
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,625
      Okay, okay, alright.

815
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,735
   Are you trying to trip me?

816
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,171
             - No.

817
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:23,211
- Look, you can just tell me
that you want to fuck me, Lily.

818
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,981
           Or don't.

819
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:29,050
     But quit it with this
     grade school shit.

820
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,344
- Okay, yeah.

821
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,445
      I'm a bit over
      this Henry, I think

822
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,547
    we need a bit of volume.

823
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:04,552
     Alright, we can either
     take one of these

824
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:06,287
    pretty blue pills or
    you can get the fuck out

825
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:08,056
       of Henry's house.

826
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:09,758
         Ladies first.

827
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,626
      Everybody take one.

828
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,195
            And one.

829
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,097
            And uno.

830
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,803
      And uh, one for you.

831
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,040
      Last but not least.

832
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,809
      Henri I'll see you
      in about two hours.

833
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,279
             Enjoy.

834
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,838
      - I know I've been
      really weird lately.

835
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,408
   But I just wanted to say
   I'm really happy for you.

836
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,879
- Well that's wonderful to hear.

837
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,831
       Tell us about your
       last girlfriend.

838
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,702
           - Aaahhh.

839
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,274
        There's not much
        to tell, really.

840
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:07,842
             Umm...

841
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:11,212
 I was in love with her, and...

842
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:15,517
         Then I wasn't.

843
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:23,358
        - Was she a 10?

844
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:31,833
         - You're a 10.

845
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,469
   If I put you two together.

846
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,518
     Is everybody alright?

847
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,620
           - Mmm-hmm.

848
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:01,196
   - I want to kiss you both.

849
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,873
            - Well?

850
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,932
            - Fuck.

851
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,995
   - Good morning, pussycat.

852
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,017
        - What is that?

853
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,430
      - Please, tell me if
      I'm doing something

854
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:24,866
       fucked up here,
       I'd like to know.

855
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:25,933
   - I'm not talking to you.

856
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:27,869
           - Why not?

857
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:29,871
    - That means you made
    Henri blow you so long,

858
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:32,774
 he fell asleep on your vagina.

859
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,511
 - Okay, so this is about him?

860
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,517
     It's about you then,
     it's always about you.

861
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,452
      - Why did you do it?

862
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:46,020
     - What did you expect?

863
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:48,890
      Lily, listen, do you
      think I'd be pissed

864
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:50,091
         if it was you?

865
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,993
       - Do not touch me.

866
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,662
       - Don't ruin this.

867
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,931
I keep trying to make this fun,

868
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,199
this whole summer, and you keep

869
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:59,834
      fucking ruining it.

870
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:01,602
    - Wait, are you serious?

871
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,738
   I'm the one ruining this?

872
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,039
      Kat, you ruined
      everything, you are

873
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,975
actually destroying everything!

874
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:09,911
 - What are you talking about?

875
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:12,580
     - You hurt me and
     you betrayed me, Kat!

876
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:14,215
    And if you really felt
    so fucking bad about it,

877
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:17,018
       you wouldn't even
       consider leaving.

878
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,788
  - I didn't know I hurt you.

879
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,858
     - Yeah, well you hurt
     me really fucking bad.

880
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:29,831
     It hurts like hell,
     okay, and you keep on

881
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:32,633
      saying that I'm the
      one ruining this?

882
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,869
      We spent four years
      pretending that

883
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:38,473
  we were going to completely
  take over the world,

884
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:41,142
   and then like, completely,
   out of the blue,

885
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:44,145
    you tell me that you're
    moving to England

886
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:46,848
         a week before?

887
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,850
     And you're not moving
     for a job, okay,

888
01:14:48,852 --> 01:14:50,852
 just stop fucking saying that.

889
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:53,254
     You are moving because
     you are scared.

890
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:55,957
      And because you're
      bored and it's easy,

891
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:59,126
  and you're bored and you
  don't know what else to do.

892
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:01,496
       And it's just so
       easy to move, when

893
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:03,764
     all you really think
     about is getting drunk

894
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:05,867
        and getting high
        and getting laid

895
01:15:05,869 --> 01:15:08,903
      and having fun, and
      you know what Kat?

896
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:10,204
    That's because you don't
    really do anything.

897
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:12,974
 You don't fucking do anything!

898
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:15,176
     And nobody else seems
     to really realize it,

899
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:18,279
 because you have this awesome
 fucking British accent.

900
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:21,749
     It's like bollocks,
     I'm packed, and I can

901
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:24,819
     do whatever I want,
     cheeri-o, and I can be

902
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:27,522
 split and tipping and fucking

903
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:30,591
        going all around
        tra la la la la,

904
01:15:30,593 --> 01:15:32,560
but because I'm blonde and hot,

905
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:34,262
  people think I'm whimsical.

906
01:15:34,264 --> 01:15:36,264
     It's all, oh, righty-o
     why don't I just

907
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:39,734
  go ahead and fuck everyone!

908
01:15:39,736 --> 01:15:41,802
   And I mean that literally
   and figuratively,

909
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:44,605
    Kat, you fuck everyone.

910
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:48,943
       - I never, never
       meant to hurt you.

911
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,882
- You hurt me all the time, Kat.

912
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,985
       Whenever it makes
       you feel better.

913
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:25,680
  Don't fucking do that again!

914
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,966
- Describe your
  friendship in one word.

915
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:22,703
       - That's a really
       stupid question.

916
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:25,373
- I'm just
     trying to understand.

917
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:28,709
            - Umm...

918
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:32,747
       I mean it's not
       that complicated.

919
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,118
    We were really close and
    then she fucked it up.

920
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,440
- You're
    coming tomorrow, right?

921
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:01,842
- Coming to what?

922
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,078
   - Kat's going away thing.

923
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,949
         - Where is it?

924
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,019
 - I assumed you organized it.

925
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,689
       - Yeah, we'll see.

926
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,957
- She's your best friend, Lily.

927
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:20,027
  You can't just not be there.

928
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:34,942
             - You.

929
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:35,843
            - Lily.

930
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:37,278
   I came here to apologize.

931
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:37,945
           - Really?

932
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:38,946
         Tell me more.

933
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:42,016
      - Well, we promised
      that you wouldn't

934
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:44,819
       let your shit get
       in the way of us?

935
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:46,854
      - You're the one
      that's full of shit!

936
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:49,990
   - Oh come on, I know that
   you don't believe that.

937
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:51,992
  - Get the fuck out of here.

938
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:54,028
    - I'm sorry, that is not
    how we speak to clients.

939
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:56,831
     - Eat a dick, Agatha!

940
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:09,043
      - I think it's safe
      to assume you don't

941
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:11,212
    want to be here anymore.

942
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,749
I mean you're bored, you're....

943
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:19,120
  I don't know, what are you?

944
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:21,255
             - 23.

945
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:23,124
             - 23.

946
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:25,226
    You feel like you should
    be doing something,

947
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:27,495
           exciting.

948
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,130
  - That's not the way it is.

949
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:31,165
        - Oh, no, it is.

950
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:33,334
    I see what goes on here.

951
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:37,972
      My last job sucked
      the life out of me.

952
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,941
      That's why I hire
      people like Agatha.

953
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,943
     Nothing left to suck.

954
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,412
           You know.

955
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,385
     So I'm gonna fire you.

956
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,554
   And look, I say go for it.

957
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:55,289
    Get your hands dirty,
    get poor, get desperate,

958
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,057
     try ecstasy, do coke.

959
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:58,926
     Get fucking dangerous.

960
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:03,430
      40, with kids, and a
      miserable mortgage.

961
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:06,300
Now's the time to fucking live.

962
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:12,807
      Now I know you, are
      having, proble--

963
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:15,810
      Where are you going?

964
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,838
          - Holy fuck!

965
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,241
            Really?

966
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,110
            Really.

967
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:55,216
         Get back here!

968
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,377
- I wanted
       to say goodbye.

969
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,049
 The plane leaves in two hours.

970
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,351
   Anything you want to say?

971
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:08,455
- Not this time, my love.

972
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,030
- Have
      you stayed in touch?

973
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,631
            - Yeah.

974
01:23:57,633 --> 01:23:59,767
       We talk sometimes.

975
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:06,140
- How
      are you feeling now?

976
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:10,077
    - Really good, actually.

977
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:11,245
      I don't know, I
      think that sometimes

978
01:24:11,247 --> 01:24:15,249
    you have to split
    apart in order to grow.

979
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:19,286
          Or grow up.

980
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,256
- And is
     that the profound note

981
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:24,792
      you want to end on?

982
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:29,063
     - I mean, who says
     that this is the end?
