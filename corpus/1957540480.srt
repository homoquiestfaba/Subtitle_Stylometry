550
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:17,638
and you about to get out.

551
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:23,349
When is this gonna end?

552
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:25,934
I mean when are you gonna grow up?

553
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:28,299
I ain't trying to hear
that shit right now.

554
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:31,491
You know what, it's all about you.

555
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,673
Everything is about you.

556
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:37,716
You don't give a fuck
about nobody but you!

557
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:39,967
I know I put you through a lot.

558
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:42,574
But I love you and my son.

559
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,366
Yeah, I doubt that.

560
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:50,355
You don't think I wanted
to have your child?

561
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,653
But I would not want to have a child

562
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:55,028
who's not gonna have a father, a family!

563
00:29:58,115 --> 00:30:01,577
I thought we were gonna get married.

564
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,068
But your past came back with you

565
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,233
and it sure as hell came back with me.

566
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:09,854
I give your son the love that he needs.

567
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:13,063
Love that you ain't never give nobody.

568
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:16,793
What you came down here to beat me up?

569
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:19,497
Huh, that's what you came down here to do?

570
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,232
I told you when I get out of here,

571
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:22,995
I'ma take care of my family.

572
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:25,155
That's what I'm talking about.

573
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,313
If you cared about your son,

574
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:28,595
you would never have him
around drugs and shit!

575
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:30,195
I love my son.

576
00:30:30,237 --> 00:30:32,773
I wouldn't put him in
a situation like that.

577
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:34,595
This is legit business.

578
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:36,297
I don't know how you
expect me to believe

579
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,006
either one of those.

580
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:40,814
You don't even know.

581
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:43,356
Rita Robinson want to sign me.

582
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:47,315
I mean I didn't know better.

583
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:49,440
But I guess it's a start.

584
00:30:52,237 --> 00:30:55,530
You wanna bring Kevin
to see me next week?

585
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:58,617
Yeah, he wanna be here when you get out.

586
00:30:58,659 --> 00:30:59,971

That's the only music he listens to.

Yeah, he found your music on his iPad

658
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:42,059
and then he sneaks and listens to it.

659
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:43,217
Aigh't, well look,

660
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:44,721

[Kevin] Yes.

668
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,499
Okay, what type of position you play?

669
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:58,561
Striker.

670
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,798
Striker?

671
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,899
What does a striker do?

672
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:04,118
I just kick the ball real hard.

673
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,533
But I keep slipping and falling

674
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:08,983
because my shoes are old and not good.

675
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:12,108
Oh, no wonder why you keep falling.

676
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,998
Uh-uh, we gonna have to fix that.

677
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,838
The next game, I'ma have some new shoes.

678
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,518
We gonna fix that, right?

679
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,899
Yeah, but it's today.

680
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:21,037
That was his surprise.

681
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,973
I was gonna tell you
when we got in the house.

682
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:25,499
Oh, man, that's wonderful.

683

to watch my son kick butt?

Thanks, Valerie.

692
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:54,674
So, Cortney mentioned you wanted
to speak with me personally

693
00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:56,708
so I immediately cleared my schedule.

694
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,303
Yes, thank you so much
for taking the time.

695
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:01,074
My pleasure.

696
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:02,956
As you know, things can
get pretty busy around here

697
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:04,740
whenever we start a new season.

698
00:35:04,782 --> 00:35:06,455
Yes, the industry is in an uproar

699
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:10,112
waiting for the winner
of Turnt every season.

700
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:11,255
So let me ask you this,

701
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:13,396
how many seasons has it been on air?

702
00:35:13,438 --> 00:35:15,874
My wife and I founded it back in 96.

703
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:17,833
Wow, congratulations.

704
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:20,677
Thanks.

705
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,107
You know, we had to make a few adjustments

706
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:23,487
because of the pandemic.

707
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:24,916
But we're still going strong.

708
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,367
And I tell you what,

00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:29,214
the streaming and
virtual events, now king.

710
00:35:29,256 --> 00:35:30,230
Yes.

711
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:32,451
The internet is where it's at.

712
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:34,574
That's actually the reason
why I wanted to take

713
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,051
a meeting with you.

714
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:40,207
Do you remember Labarius
Stanford, AKA Rilla?

715
00:35:40,249 --> 00:35:41,710
I sure do.

716
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:42,712
How could I forget?

717
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:44,174
He was shot on our
property a few years back.

719
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:50,644
Please don't tell me you're here

720
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:52,414
to discuss that young man.

721
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:54,090
Actually, I am.

722
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:56,291
Artists like him make your show.

723
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,830
Your audience tunes in
to see people like him

724
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,712
because that's who they can relate to.

725
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:02,447
That's true.

726
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:05,150
But you do know our
ratings hit an all time low

727
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:07,390
after that event took place.

728
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,690
And you know, the fact he
went to prison right after

729
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:12,170
caused us to lose sponsors left and right.

730
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,748
Truthfully, it hurts the other contestants

731
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,633
more than it hurts the show.

732
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,908
Well I can't argue with you on that.

733
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,452
I mean this show has been
a backbone for many artists

734
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:22,271
since I started my record label.

735
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:26,528
In fact, my most successful
artist started on Turnt.

736
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,783
I guess what I'm trying to say

737
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:30,868
is that the hip-hop
genre has a lot of fans

738
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,494
and I think that you should
think about bringing it back.

739
00:36:34,536 --> 00:36:37,329
I can't promise you that.

740
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:39,908
But I can promise I'll think about it.

741
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,348
I have a question.

742
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,181
Shoot.

743
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:44,369
Why is this so important to you?

744
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,532
We all know Rita Robinson
only signs female artists.

745
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:49,828
Is this a chess move,

746
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,751
you're looking to sign
your first male artist?

747
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,988
You can't ask me to take a risk

748
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,947
if you're not ready to.

749
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,431
Mr. Denver, do you
know why my record label

750
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:04,890
is so successful?

751
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:06,884
No.

752
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:09,124
Because all my risks will be lower

753
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:11,009
than my counterparts.

754
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:13,287
Because you leave everyone
else to take the risks?

755
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,996
No, because I take
them when others don't.

756
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,657
You have a nice day, Mr. Denver.

757
00:37:29,126 --> 00:37:30,224
[Rilla] Your daddy's still here?

758
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,724
No, he at the airport.

759
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:35,025
Oh man, I thought
he'd be retired by now.

760
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,405
Shoot, he still hate me?

761
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:37,905
No, this his last year at Delta.

762
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:40,364
And yeah, he still hates you.

763
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:46,844
Are you going to sleep
in mommy's room too?

764
00:37:46,886 --> 00:37:48,340
[Rilla] Son, what you mean?

765
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:51,527
You six years old, you still
sleeping with your mama?

766
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,305
No, my uncle sleeps in there sometimes

767
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:57,178
but I have my Spiderman
bed in my own room.

768
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,072
[Rilla] Mmm, you just
get ready for the game.

769
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:00,905
[Kevin] Okay.

770
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:01,947
All right.

771
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:07,310
It's not like that.

772
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,352

773
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,376
I need to hold the keys to your car.

774
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:13,007
Aren't you gonna make it to his game?

775
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,135
Of course.

776
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:15,532
I got something to do.

777

What you need to do
just went in the house.

Yeah, staying on the
sidewalks off the street.

00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:59,991
[laughing] Yeah.

You know what though,

801
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:03,310
it was actually your sister
that kept me off the street.

don't want this no more.

806

You know, I tried to
stick around but it was,

I understand death.

809

My mama died, she just lost it.

811

But...

813
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:28,071
Rita told me to give you this.

814
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:29,947
She got a package for you.

has been streaming for five years nonstop.

817

So there's a check in there.

819

Well, it's like buying a record

but you just listen to it on your phone.

821

That's hot.

917

Oh yeah, I'm weighing that.

Just happy I got some new clean shit on.

931
00:46:27,294 --> 00:46:29,012
Well you look great.

932
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:30,809

play the game very well.

934
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:35,192
You always on point so you
ain't got to get on point.

Thank you.

That's why you do it big.

All right, so what's going on?

Well, this is Frank
Lester, our attorney.

Nice to meet you, brother.

And this here is Thriller,

I got some heat for you.

946
00:46:55,894 --> 00:46:57,909
Oh yeah, I heard it

947
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:59,062
You wanna get on this one?

Okay then.

951
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:05,101
Here, let me play it,

[phone buzzing]

955
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:14,560
You can rock with this?

956
00:47:16,675 --> 00:47:18,658
Oh, excuse me, I gotta take this.

957
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,697
This is my son.

958
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:22,776
Mm-mm, don't even worry about it.

959
00:47:22,818 --> 00:47:24,402
He's not yours, okay?

960
00:47:24,444 --> 00:47:27,138
So now you see why I had
to go get him, right?

961
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,597
I see why you got your man out of jail.

962
00:47:31,484 --> 00:47:32,721
[Rilla] Get away from
him, get away from him.

963
00:47:32,763 --> 00:47:34,500
That's it, you got it, Kevin.

964
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:35,505
[Ladonna] Kick it!

965
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:36,703

967
00:47:42,885 --> 00:47:44,886
- Good job Kevin, good job!
- Good job!

968
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,578
Is he the best on his team?

969
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,545
He might be, that's his first goal.

970
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:49,701
Oh yeah?

971
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:51,926
His first one, hasn't scored one yet.

972
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:53,723
I guess it's 'cause you here.

973
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:54,598
Oh, no.

974
00:47:55,432 --> 00:47:56,763
Look.

975
00:47:56,805 --> 00:48:00,145
I know I pushed through a
lot of things but I got you.

976
00:48:00,187 --> 00:48:02,342
I'll get you a new
house, new car, all that.

977
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:05,790
We can get back to where we was at.

978
00:48:05,832 --> 00:48:06,665
Look.

979
00:48:09,104 --> 00:48:12,305
I just want you to focus
on Kevin right now,

980
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,042
try and get my career back.

981
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:18,582
What, you seeing
somebody else or something?

982

[somber music]

983
00:48:20,284 --> 00:48:24,145
You got things going on in your life?

984
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:25,770
That's real though.

985
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:29,820
I respect it.

[crowd cheering]

987
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:50,132
Daddy!

988
00:48:52,892 --> 00:48:53,932
I scored!

989
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:55,050
Did you see me?

990
00:48:55,092 --> 00:48:57,448
Yeah, we seen you, you did wonderful.

00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,690
Hey man, nice meeting you.

992
00:48:58,732 --> 00:49:00,047
I just wanted to come by and tell you

993
00:49:00,089 --> 00:49:01,932
thank you for the donation to the team.

994
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:03,417
Parents really appreciate it.

995
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:04,325
Yeah, that's what's up.

996
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:05,441
You'll see a lot more of me.

997
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:06,606
Man, we look forward to it.

998
00:49:06,648 --> 00:49:08,492
- Good job, Kevin.
- Good job, man.

You rocked that joint huh?

1001
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:14,842
Good job.

1002
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,635
[lightly tense music]

1003
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:40,680
[Ladonna's Dad] How'd he do?

1004
00:49:40,722 --> 00:49:42,077
He scored a goal.

1005
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:42,952
Wow.

1006
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:44,872
Amazing.

1007
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:50,186
Maybe because his father
decided to show up.

1008
00:49:51,424 --> 00:49:52,797
Amazing what kids can accomplish

1009
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:54,241
when their father's in their life.

1010
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,724
Daddy, please.

1011
00:49:55,766 --> 00:49:56,742
Look, here, baby.

1012
00:49:56,784 --> 00:49:58,204
Go in the house and get
ready for dinner, okay?

1013
00:49:58,246 --> 00:49:59,913
Take that, will you?

1014
00:50:06,143 --> 00:50:08,620
He don't know what a
real father supposed to do.

1015
00:50:08,662 --> 00:50:10,185
Real father stays in the child life

1016
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:12,122
until their last day on earth,

1017
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:14,077
no matter how old they get.

1018
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,422
See, I'm a real father.

1019
00:50:16,464 --> 00:50:20,102
I had your child in my
home for five years.

1020
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:22,638
And you stand here with
all this fancy shit on

1021
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,627
like you're supposed to be somebody,

1022
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:26,752
but you ain't shit to me.

1023
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:31,462
It takes a real man to be a real father.

1024
00:50:31,504 --> 00:50:35,461
All you wanna do is just be a real nigger.

1025
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:37,177
Imagine somebody did this to your child.

1026
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:39,762
Daddy, please, just...

1027
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:40,887
Dad, just go.

1028
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:44,848
[Dad scoffing]

1029
00:50:46,665 --> 00:50:49,753
Look, I am so sorry about that.

1030
00:50:49,795 --> 00:50:51,212
Nah, it's cool.

1031
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,077
He right.

1032
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,679
Sat down for five years
and thought about that.

1033
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,295
But I ran into Cortney.

1034
00:50:58,337 --> 00:50:59,670
Wait, Cortney?

1035
00:51:00,653 --> 00:51:02,578
Like you seen Cortney?

1036
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,170
Yeah.

1037
00:51:04,212 --> 00:51:05,415
What'd he say?

1038
00:51:05,457 --> 00:51:07,411
Is everything good with y'all?

1039
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:09,310
Yeah, everything's wonderful.

1040
00:51:09,352 --> 00:51:10,317
He's 100.

1041
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,494
He did what he say he was gonna do.

1042
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,819
So we can get up out of here ASAP.

1043
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:16,694
Wait.

1044

Labarius.

1045
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:23,069
I told you, I don't want that no more.

1046
00:51:25,237 --> 00:51:27,070
I've given you enough.

1047
00:51:30,718 --> 00:51:31,551
Right.

1048

1049
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,420
Yes, Daddy?

1050
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:44,631
Wait, who is that?

1051
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:46,006
Rita Robinson.

1052
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:51,390
You know what, why don't
you take your son with you?

1053
00:51:51,432 --> 00:51:52,265
Listen.

1054
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,670
Daddy will be back, couple of days.

1055
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,511
Gonna get the house you wanted, right?

1056
00:51:57,553 --> 00:51:59,555
With a big swing set
and a swimming pool?

1057
00:51:59,597 --> 00:52:01,034
Yeah.

1058
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,131
Let me see your phone.

1059
00:52:02,173 --> 00:52:04,206
For what, you ain't
got no business in there.

1060
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:06,248
Let me see your phone.

1061
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:09,225
Now look.

1062
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:13,850
You call me anytime you need me,

1063
00:52:13,892 --> 00:52:14,683
you see that?

1064
00:52:14,725 --> 00:52:16,045
This is your special ringtone.

1065
00:52:16,087 --> 00:52:17,334
There's Daddy.

1066
00:52:17,376 --> 00:52:20,959
So use this so Daddy
know that you calling.

1067
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,511
[car starting]

1068
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:32,202
I'ma make a store run real quick.

1069
00:52:32,244 --> 00:52:33,334
A'ight well don't be too long

1070
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:34,387
'cause we gotta get outta here.

1071
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:35,846
[Rilla] A'ight.

1072
00:52:39,238 --> 00:52:41,405
So you must be the boss.

1073
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:47,020
Excuse me?

1074
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:49,002
I'm Rita Robinson, and you are?

1075
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:51,322
I'm Mr. Henry, Ladonna's father.

1076
00:52:51,364 --> 00:52:52,807
I know who you are.

1077
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:55,900
The only female music
producer in the business.

1078
00:52:55,942 --> 00:52:57,356
I have a question.

1079
00:52:57,398 --> 00:53:00,640
Why would a woman, a black woman

1080
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:03,309
who so-called cares about her people

1081
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:06,480
affiliate herself with a
man that don't give a fuck

1082
00:53:06,522 --> 00:53:07,865
about his son,

1083
00:53:07,907 --> 00:53:10,019
let alone a black man?

1084
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,946
I would think that
given the current state

1085
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,375
of the black man in America

1086
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:16,544
that you would identify with Rilla.

1087
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:17,836
Ha ha, I see.

1088
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,260
You in love with him.

1089
00:53:21,302 --> 00:53:22,469
Just remember.

1090
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,282
The heart fools the mind.

1091

1093
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:36,244
There was a reason why Zina
Holloway was on my team.

1094
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:37,779

between me and you.

Rita obviously knows her shit

1208
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:16,445
so I'm inclined to agree, but,

1209
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:19,485
my only quirk is that
this is a family show.

but to permanently ban
