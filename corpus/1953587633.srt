cocktail.

but...  Lea: I don't think so,
Mom.

vegan dish.

179

potluck thing.
Cynthia: Sure!

180
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,815
Lea:But you know, we could go
out to dinner sometime for
vegan,

181
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:03,021
Teddy: No. You know what?
She'll be fine. She'll be fine.
She eats like a bird anyway.

182
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,924
Lea: A vegan bird.

183

me Teddy, but I'm kind of
all-in with my kayaks right now.

215
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,430
Teddy: I heard there was a
problem with those.

216

217
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,569
Teddy: Hmm, I don't remember.

218
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,170
Teddy: Anyway, we're not
talking about a lot of money
here, dude.

219
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,206
And it'd be first
in, first out.

money.

Teddy: Really?

222
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,446
Aaron: It's just not the right
time.

223
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,114
Teddy: Just come by and see it.
The location,

224
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:13,451
un-fucking-believable. It just
needs a gut job.

225
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,587
Aaron: Well that'll cost more
than fifty grand.

226
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:20,859
Teddy: No shit. You're not the
only investor I'm talking to.

227
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,095
Teddy: You think Lea would be
interested?

228
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,065
Aaron: I speak for both of us.

229
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,134
Teddy: How about her parents?

230
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,438
Aaron: No.

231
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,976
Teddy: Well, Aaron...with all
that happened with me and
Proem,

232
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:41,012
you don't think you
could throw a little my way?

233
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,313
Aaron: With you and Proem?

234
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,615
Teddy: You know.

235
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:47,585
Aaron: No, Teddy, I don't.

236
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:52,490
Teddy: Really.

237
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:57,428
Teddy: Huh.

238
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,199
Teddy: You know, Neil told me

239
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:05,904
Teddy: before he died, he said
some kind of interesting things.

240
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,640
Teddy: He was like, quoting a
lot of stuff.

241
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:11,643
Teddy: Like, he said, History
is the version of past events

242
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,212
that people have decided to
agree on.

243
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,214
Aaron: He was obsessed with
Napoleon.

244
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:23,354
Teddy: Yeah, but this was in
the context of Proem. And
Version 2.0.

245
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,291
Aaron: How?

246
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:30,528
Teddy: I don't know. That
doesn't make any sense to you?

247
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,531
Aaron: Well, he was pretty
delusional at the end.

248
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:37,302
Teddy: Yeah, this was a little
before that though.

249
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,171
Teddy: He also said something
about Proem maybe not really
being worth

250
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,207
what everybody
thought it was worth.

251
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,511
Aaron: It was worth what the
market said it was worth.

252
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:52,583
Teddy: No, it was more like, it
wasn't actually what the market
thought it was.

253
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:57,989
Aaron: What does that mean?

254
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:06,297
Teddy: I don't know. I always
wondered about that.

255
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:12,603
Teddy: So, Mark's baby sister.
"Little Lee-Lee."

256
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,472
Aaron: It's just Lea now.

257
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,608
Teddy: Quite the catch, man.

258
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,377
Aaron: I'm a lucky man.

259
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,146
Teddy: Mm hmm, you can say that
again.

260
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,249
Teddy: Hey, I heard you guys
did that whole weekend-long
retreat thing,

261
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,754
Teddy: All that like, uh,
sharing and soul searching.

262
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,422
Aaron: Who told you that?

263
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,292
Teddy: Neil. He and Marnie did
it too.

264
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:38,396
Teddy: Yeah, he said it was
great. Make sure you both
really know each other,

265
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:42,500
Teddy: That you both really
know what you're getting into
and all that, right?

266
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,403
Aaron: That's the idea.

267
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,271
Teddy: Isn't that like a
Catholic thing?

268
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,241
Aaron: Uh, I think so,
originally.

269
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,143
Teddy: You think Simone and I
should do it?

270
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,711
Aaron: You're not engaged, are
you?

271
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,280
Teddy: No.

272
00:16:56,282 --> 00:17:03,054
Aaron: Well I think the idea is
to do it before, you know, a
lifelong commitment.

273
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,056
Teddy: So apparently you passed
muster.

274
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,592
Aaron: HaHa...Apparently.

275
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,193
Teddy: No major deal killers.

276
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,162
Aaron: Guess not.

277
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:15,066
Teddy: Or none you cared to
share, anyway. Or dared to.

278
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,668
Aaron: We shared everything.

279
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,472
Teddy: Even Gitta Glitter?

280
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,748
Aaron: Her last name was Girard.

281
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,485
Teddy: Yeah? Well, I'll always
remember her as Gitta Glitter.

282
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:51,436
Teddy: You didn't, did you?

283
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:55,706
Teddy: You know how she got
that nickname, right?

284
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,444
Teddy: Yeah, maybe you're
better off not knowing.

285
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,283
Aaron: Oh. Wow. Teddy.

286
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:09,353

287

myself.

couldn't.

want it.

give it to your wife.

00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,864
Aaron: He didn't ask my
permission.

339
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,900
Lea: He doesn't have to.

340
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,802
Aaron: Well, how can I get my
fucking name off of it?

341
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,403
Lea: Just, untag yourself.

342
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,505
Aaron: How?

343
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,306
Lea: There will be a link next
to your name.

344
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,610
Lea: You have to log on as
yourself.

345
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,312
Aaron: So it's just sitting out
there. Forever.

346
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,816
Lea: You can ask him to delete
it.

347
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,852
Aaron: Teddy.

348
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,555
Lea: I thought you were going
to ignore his friend request.

349
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,992
Aaron: He wouldn't stop bugging
me.

350
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:09,000
Lea: By the way, you looked
totally hot.

351
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,869
Lea: Somebody touched a nerve.

352
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,639
Lea: So, who was Gitta Girard?

353
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,640
Aaron: Where is it?

354
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:21,512
Lea: Right there!

355
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,681
Lea: So?

356
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,749
Aaron: What?

357
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,985
Lea: Gitta?

358
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,489
Aaron: It's all a bit of a blur.

359
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,025
Lea: Seems like she'd be pretty
hard to forget.

360
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,102
Teddy: I'm sorry I brought my
girlfriend to your birthday
party.

361
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,805
Aaron: Nah, it was fun.

362
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,507
Teddy: I just thought it would
be a cool surprise. For both of
you.

363
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,910
Aaron: It was.

364
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,778
Teddy: Thank you.

365
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,751
Aaron: But, I'm not a big fan
of being tagged in photos
online.

366
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,120
Teddy: I thought you'd get a
kick out of that.

367
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,756
Aaron: I didn't.

368
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:43,427
Teddy: I bet Lea did.

369
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,498
Teddy: Okay, Mr. Old-fashioned.

370
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,402
Aaron: Well, I better

371
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:55,773
Teddy: You ever wonder what
happened to Gitta?

372
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,675
Aaron: Not particularly.

373
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:01,645
Teddy: You didn't keep in
touch? After you broke her
heart?

374
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,614
Aaron: I didn't break her heart.

375
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,016
Teddy: I did.

376
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,418
Aaron: What?

377
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,053
Teddy: Kept in touch.

378
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,122
Aaron: Good for you.

379
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:16,527
Teddy: She's happily married
now too. Or married, anyway.

380
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,829
Teddy: In fact, she lives in
Montreal.

381
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:22,633
That's actually just a few hours
north of here, isn't it?

382
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:25,503
Aaron: Yeah, about three.

383
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,705
Teddy: You never wish it was
you?

384
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,774
Aaron: What?

385
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:30,875
Teddy: Happily married to Gitta
Glitter?

386
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,743
Aaron: I am happily married.

387
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,446
Teddy: 'Course you are.

388
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:39,583
Aaron: Gotta get to work.

389
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,153
Teddy: I'm sure she'd love to
hear from you.

390
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,721
She'd probably be too shy
to friend you though.

391
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:44,722
Teddy: Maybe you should friend
her.

392
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,590
Aaron: Maybe I will.

393
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,826
Teddy: Or I could tell her you
said it was okay for her to
friend you.

394
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:52,062
Aaron: Enough! Okay?

397
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,249
Teddy: Did we miss much?

398
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,684
Gavin: No, they just started.

399
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,652
Teddy: Great

us?

401
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,921
Teddy: Sure.

Simone: Thank you.

403
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,259
Simone: Oh! Don't worry, we can
sit on the ground.

404
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,995
Aaron: No, we've got another
one in the car.

405
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,263
Teddy: But you're gonna miss
the show.

406
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,932
Aaron: It'll just take a few
minutes.

407
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:02,933
Teddy: I'll come with you.

408
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,869
Aaron: No. No, it's okay.

409
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,504
Lea: Simone, sit down.

410
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,242
Teddy: You know if you just
hear me out on this thing,
Aaron.

411
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,744
I think you'll see
its got mad potential.

412
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:16,113
Aaron: I'm just not looking for
something like that right now,
Teddy.

413
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,848
Teddy: Like what? You don't
even know what it is.

414
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,551
Aaron: Teddy, how many
different ways do you want me
to say no?

415
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,219
Teddy: Aaron, we all know what
Proem sold for.

416
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:25,289
Aaron: A long time ago.

417
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:29,126
Teddy: Don't you think the least
you could do is hear me out?

418
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,228
Considering all that
happened with me and Proem?

419
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,731
Aaron: You never worked for
Proem, Teddy.

420
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:37,668
Teddy: Before it was Proem -
when it was just an idea. Our
idea. In Prague.

421
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,271
Aaron: Even if you were, in
fact, there when we thought of
it...

422
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:44,174
Teddy: I said what if? I
planted the seed.

423
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:48,245
Aaron: Everybody in the world
said what if? But we figured it
out. Mark, Neil, and me.

424
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,246
Teddy: Yeah, after you pushed
me out.

425
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:54,552
Aaron: You were never in.

426
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,120
Teddy: Aaron, I know I could be
kind of difficult back then...

427
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,788
Aaron: No, Teddy - come on.
That's not...

428
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,992
Teddy: No it's okay. I know.
But, I've actually changed a
lot.

429
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,862
Aaron: We all have.

430
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:09,667
Ever since Prague it seemed like
you and Mark didn't want to be
my friend anymore.

431
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:17,841
Aaron: Come on Teddy! We never
were. Neil was.

432
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:21,178
Teddy: He didn't like you as
much as you think he did, you
know.

433
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,115
Teddy: He once said you were a
non-player.

434
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,751
Aaron: Goddammit.

435
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,921
Katie: What?

436
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,689
Aaron: Nothing.

437
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,262
Aaron: Can I see your message
log?

438
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,098
Katie: Whose number do you need?

439
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,868
Aaron: Can I just see it,
please?

440
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,971
Aaron: Thank you.

441
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,276
Aaron: I'll give it back to you
in a minute.

442
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,913
Katie: Okay.

443
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,849
Aaron: Close the door.

444
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,930
Aaron: What do you want, Teddy?

445
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,087
Gitta: Come in.

446
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,956
Gitta: Aaron?

447
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:19,296
Gitta: You have some explaining
to do, mister.

448
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:27,271
Aaron: What are you doing here?

449
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,707
Gitta: You didn't expect me?

450
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:48,792
Gitta: Teddy told me that... He
told me that you wanted to see
me.

451
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,829
Aaron: I'm gonna kill him.

452
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,198
Gitta: I am such a fool. I'm
sorry.

453
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,235
Aaron: Wait. Wait.
Gitta: Please just let me go.

454
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:03,006
Aaron: I have some explaining
to do?

455
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:06,977
Gitta: You just... disappeared.

456
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,779
Aaron: You never answered my
letter.

457
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:12,349
Gitta: What letter?

458
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:16,353
Gitta: What What letter?

459
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:19,990
Aaron: The day I left I left
you a letter. I asked you to
come join me.

460
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,458
Gitta: No, you just disappeared.

461
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,229
Aaron: No, I gave it to Neil to
give to you.

462
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:33,871
Gitta: Why would you write such
a letter? What if I didn't
receive it?

463
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:40,010
Gitta: You hoped that I
wouldn't receive it. That was
your passive way out.

464
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:47,151
Aaron: No, I gave it to Neil
the day I left to give to you.

465
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:52,389
Aaron: Why didn't he give it to
you?

466
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,092
Gitta: You didn't want to be
with me.

467
00:29:55,094 --> 00:30:00,497
Aaron: No, I did. I... I waited.

468
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,099
Gitta: You didn't know how to
explain me.

469
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:05,435
Aaron: No I... assumed.

470
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,972
Gitta: Then why would you do
such a thing, Aaron?

471
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:18,315
Gitta: It's so unlike you. What
if I didn't receive it? I
didn't receive it.

472
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:40,270
Gitta: You look good.

473
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:43,073
Aaron: So do you.

474
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:29,019
Aaron: I'm married.

475
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:33,156
Gitta: Do you love her?

476
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:39,396
Aaron: Yes.

477
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,065
Gitta: Good for you.

478
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:01,952
Gitta: Why didn't you try
harder?

479
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:11,995
Aaron: I'm sorry. I'm sorry

480
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:20,404
Aaron: I'm sorry. I'm sorry

481
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,286
Aaron: What?

482
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,597
Aaron: That, uh...

483
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,467
Aaron: That girl that was in
the photo with me that Teddy
posted...

484
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,637
Lea: Yeah?

485
00:32:53,639 --> 00:33:02,446
Aaron: She was actually my
girlfriend at the time. Sort of

486
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,648
Lea: Well what happened to her?

487
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,383
Aaron: I don't know.

488
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:09,419
Lea: I mean why did you break
up?

489
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:17,260
Aaron: It's just... It never
would have worked out. I had to
go back to the States and...

490
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,495
Lea: And?

491
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,232
Aaron: She was...

492
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:28,038
Aaron: She was a call girl.

493
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,240
Lea: So she wasn't your
girlfriend.

494
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,043
Aaron: No, she was.

495
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,012
Lea: And she was a prostitute?

496
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:38,749
Aaron: It was complicated.

497
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,120
Lea: You really should have
told me about her, Aaron.

498
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,155
Aaron: I was too afraid.

499
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:49,059
Lea: I knew that there was
something you weren't sharing.
I knew it.

500
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,428
Aaron: This is it. I swear.

501
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,596
Lea: You think that was easy for
me?  Aaron: No.
Lea: What I shared?

502
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,098
Aaron: I know.

503
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,268
Lea: That was the whole point,
Aaron.
Aaron: I know.

504
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,370
Lea: Why would you need to go
see a prostitute?

505
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,072
Aaron: It was Neil and Teddy's

couldn't. Or anyway I couldn't.

me into giving him the money he
wanted.

things might happen to you if I
didn't.

848

in. You, you've made this bad
enough already.

because of that guy.

it was an accident if you
don't.

out.

858

might not have to.
