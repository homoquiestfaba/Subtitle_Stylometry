I love you very much.

- I just need a minute.

00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,837
Okay.

49
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:46,683
Please don't go.

50
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:49,561
Why don't you just put on some clothes,
and we can sit down and discuss this.

51
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:50,916
No. I can't do anything right now.

52
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:52,686
I'm so sorry, Pete.

53
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:54,603
I'm in love with you.

54

Why don't you just
put some clothes on, okay?

55
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:58,046
I'm not going to go put clothes on.

56
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:01,717
I know what that means,
if I put clothes on, it's over. Okay?

57
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:05,237
Excuse me.

58
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:14,687
Let's talk. Let's talk about him.

59
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,002
I feel...

60
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,725
I've been feeling

61
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,721
for a long time
that we've been growing apart.

62
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:29,038
We're leading different lives.

63
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,607
Who's the dude?

64
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:34,957
- Who's the dude?
- What?

65
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:39,206
No, that's not what this is about.
There's no one else.

66
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,398
I know what's happening here. I really do.

67
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:44,759
You've been working so much lately, that we
haven't got to spend much time together,

68
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:46,082
and you're forgetting
what it's like to be with me.

69
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,278
But maybe, if we just held each other
or something,

70
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:49,841
you would remember
what it's like to be with me.

71
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:51,481
- No.
- Just hold me.

72
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,564
Please. Here we go.

73
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,166
There's someone else.

74
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:10,802
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:30,805
We don't hang out in places like this,
Liz and I.

76
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:35,443
Why did you take me here?
This place smells like stripper's perfume.

77
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:38,765
I'm gonna get herpes
just from sitting on this couch.

78
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,677
- Sure you okay, bro? Yeah?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:44,368
Yeah. You don't have to keep asking me.
I'm good.

80
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,843

00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:56,929

<i>Maybe you should work
on the Dracula musical. </i>

86
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:03,054
Look, you've been working on it for a while.
It'll help your mind. Be creative.

87
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,974
- Think about you.
- I think I need to fuck somebody.

88
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:06,212
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

89
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:09,249
You're not my stepbrother any more.
You're a step-stranger.

90
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:10,810
- Why you talking like that?
- Brian!

91
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:12,814
You don't need to put
your P in a V right now.

92
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:17,169
No, I don't.
I need to B my L on somebody's T's.

93
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:19,652
That's disgusting.
You don't need to be doing that.

94
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:22,245
And if anything,
you should leave your P in the V

95
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:25,813
and blow it inside the V,
so you can have a B-A-B-Y

96
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,086
and be a normal person.

97
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,935
I'm leaving, man. I'm out of here.

98
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:32,732
She's fucking somebody.
Okay, Bri? It's all I can think about,

99
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:34,085
is that she's out there,

100
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:36,811
and until I do the same thing,
I'm gonna feel like I wanna die.

101
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:40,725
So just talk to girls with me tonight,
all right?

102
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:44,611
All right. All right, I'll help you out.
I'll talk to girls with you.

103
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,848
So, Peter, what do you do?

104
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,330
Musician.

105
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:52,972
<i>He's being modest.
He works on a show called Crime Scene. </i>

106
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,889
Oh, my God!

107
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,690
- It is what it is, you know?
- No, I love that show.

108
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:01,775
<i>Wait, Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime
or Crime Scene: Phoenix?</i>

109
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:05,526
<i>- Scene of the Crime.
- Oh, my God! I love that show. </i>

110
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,456
I find you both very sexually attractive.

111
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,697
Let's pump the brakes. Okay?

112
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,012
I think that having sex with either of you

113
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:18,651
would be a great treat for me.

114
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,369
You are so funny.

115
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:24,246
I just got out of
a five-and-a-half-year relationship,

116
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:26,971
so I'm not looking for anything serious.

117
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:31,166
- Just sexual activity.
- Let's wrap it up, buddy.

118
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:33,455
You wanna come home?

119
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,486
I'm sorry, you're cracking me up.

120
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,296
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,169
Do you wanna come home?

122
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,535
Stop it, seriously.

123
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:52,369
- That was fun.
- Yeah, yeah.

124
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:55,776
Overall, I think that went really well. Yeah.

125
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:06,815
I want to have sex with you!

126
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,851
- Are you crying?
- What? No.

127
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:22,293
I'm sorry that I'm being so weird now.

128
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:24,255
No, that's okay.

129
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:26,495
You've been weird

130
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:32,366
pretty much the whole time,
so it's not unusual. Okay.

131
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:36,327
Last night, like some sort of idiot, I had sex
with this woman who I barely even know.

132
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:40,394
I used a condom, but

133
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:44,237
I'm really scared that I have an STD, Doc.

134
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:46,834
Peter, I'm a paediatrician. Have you noticed
you're sitting on a fire truck?

135
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:50,276
- Right.
- Little kids running?

136
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:53,840
- Yeah, this is new. I like it.
- I'm kind of backed up...

137
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:56,273
Could you take a look at my penis?

138
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,043
Go ahead. Let me see it.

139
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,632
- Sorry.
- That's all right. Take it out.

140
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:05,233
Good.

141
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,920
- You barely looked at it.
- It's a good-looking dick, Peter.

142
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:09,602
- Beautiful dick.
- Do you think maybe while I'm here,

143
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:11,555
- I could get some blood work?
- Peter!

144
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:13,443
Your girlfriend dumped you, right?
Are you hurting? Are you hurt?

145
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:19,748
Stop it. Stop crying. Use your dick.
Keep fucking. Fuck everything that moves.

146
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:20,865
Just wear a condom.

147
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:24,386
Listen, I'm backed up,
I got a lot of kids. I gotta go, okay?

148
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:27,906
You want something?
You want a balloon? You want a lolly?

149
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:38,790
I just came!

150
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:55,505
Hi.

151
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,169
Hi.

152
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,775
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,129
Hi.

154
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,815
- Hi.
- Hi.

155
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,458
Okay, do you mind not saying that
over and over again?

156
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,939
You can gag me.

157
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,337
- You brought a gag?
- And handcuffs.

158
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,492
Do you wanna gag me?

159
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,659
Kind of, now.

160
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,018
What've we got today?

161
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,336
Just a walk and talk at the lab.

162
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,173
<i>That's what 20 years on Vice will do to you. </i>

164
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,812
<i>The victim's penis was found

165

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,050
<i>Can you say "dicksicle"?</i>

167
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,973
<i>Let's do this. </i>

168
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,419
Okay, I'm ready.

169
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,258
<i>The victim's penis
was found behind the AC unit. </i>

170
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,698
Just go with the usual stuff, maybe.
Something dark and ominous.

171
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,288
Like losing your penis is a bad thing.

172
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,056
Oh, you want dark and ominous.

173
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,289
Come on, I got Allman Brother tickets,
I gotta get out of here!

174
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,973
<i>That's what 20 years on Vice will do to you. </i>

175
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,057
<i>What've we got here?</i>

176
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,250
Peter! Peter, Jesus Christ!

177
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,099
You're fucking Billy Baldwin, aren't you?

178
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,531
- Aren't you?
- Pete, Pete, Pete.

179
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,571
- Stop staring at me.
- Pete!

180
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,534
You know you're not getting paid
for today's session, right?

181
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,855
- I'm aware of that.
- Fucking asshole.

182
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,056
Peter, it's Brian.

183
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,449
Go away.

184
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,615
Listen, your landlord called me.

185
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,253
Said there's smoke
coming out of your place.

186
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,099
Who, Mr Lopez? 'Cause he's a liar!

187
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,775
He doesn't...

188
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,817
We worry about you, Petey.

189
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,170
Yeah, come on, Peter. Open up the door.

190
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,372
The fire marshal's gonna come in
and bust it down.

191
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,091
You haven't been
out of the house in two weeks.

192
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,209
Why are you so damn strong?

193
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,774
I feel so strong!

194
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,411
Hey, don't walk away from me.
You come close.

195
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,732
Your place is disgusting, Peter.

196
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,815
Hey, don't walk away from me.

197
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,895
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

198
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,480
What are you burning, man? Come on.

199
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:33,591
It's everything.

200
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:36,282
It's everything that reminds me of her
and I need it gone!

201
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:40,395
Okay, I thought I was fine, Brian,
and I'm not. I'm not fine at all.

202
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:43,281
Okay, let's just put the picture down.

203
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:46,200
Put that down. Let's discuss this.

204
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:48,278
- I love her, man.
- I know.

205
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:54,040
Look, Liz and I, we think the world of Sarah.

206
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:55,914
We think she's great.

207
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:58,273
Okay, but everything...

208
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm just being honest here.

209
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:03,594
Every time she would come over
to our house,

210
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,400
she always acted,

211
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:10,673
you know, like a little bitch!

212
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:13,594
Okay, okay, pump the brakes.

213
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,839
Dating Sarah is not like dating Liz. Okay?

214
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,793
Sarah is better than Liz.

215
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:21,516
You really wanna have this conversation?

216
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,035
Do you really
wanna have this conversation?

217
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,271
Yes.

218
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:29,154
- She is the mother of my unborn child.
- Sorry.

219
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:30,556
You're my stepbrother.
We're not even blood.

220
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,591
I have no qualms with sticking you.
I will equalize you.

221
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:36,235
- Sorry.
- You dick!

222
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:37,995
I'm just worked up.

223
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:41,270
You gotta get your shit together, man.

224
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:43,359
I'm trying to. It's so hard here.

225
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,640
Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?

226
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,435
Like, she got me this,

227
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,034
okay, because I would always leave
my cereal boxes open,

228
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:54,436
and the cereal would get stale,

229
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:57,201
and so one day I came home,
and she had this waiting for me,

230
00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:01,361
because it keeps my cereal fresh.
And now I have the freshest cereal.

231
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,200
Why don't you,
you know what, go on a vacation?

232
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,914
Go to the Alps.

233
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:10,761
- Alps?
- Go to Gstaad. It's the best.

234
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:12,110
I could go to Hawaii.

235
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:14,881
Sarah was always talking about this place
in Hawaii that was supposed to be nice.

236
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:16,594
No, don't. I wouldn't go there.

237
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:20,158
What, I can't go to Hawaii now, because
Sarah Marshall has heard of Hawaii?

238
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:22,512
Then go to Hawaii. Go to Hawaii.

239
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,117
Do it.

240
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:31,553
No, no, no, don't destroy the computer.

241
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,910
I'm just deleting these pictures.

242
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:35,431
Okay, I need them off my computer.

243
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:39,994
You know what? You're not even doing
a proper permanent delete.

244
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,271
Well...

245
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:44,075
If we end up getting back together,
I wanna have a few of them left.

246
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:45,157
You're crazy.

247
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:48,202
- No, no, please don't delete them.
- They have to go. Done, done.

248
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:04,369
<i>That was hilarious. Aloha!</i>

249
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:07,486
<i>I'm Sarah Marshall from Crime Scene:
Scene of the crime. </i>

250
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:10,128
<i>And when I'm not scrubbing for evidence,
I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines... </i>

251
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:11,209
Excuse me! Hi.

252
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:12,608
<i>... to my favourite destinations. Mahalo. </i>

253
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:14,326
Hi, can I have another bloody mary, please?

254
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,765
You're still working on that one.

255
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,283
It's just an anticipatory order.

256
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,291
Okay, I'll be right back!

257
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,730
<i>What do you think caused
such excessive bleeding?</i>

258
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:39,813
<i>He was either stabbed in the aorta
or it was his time of the month. </i>

259
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:52,152
<i>Aloha!</i>

260
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:55,069
Check in this way.

261
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:08,037
- Just married?
- Yes, how did you guess?

262
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,712
Oh, you've got that magic newlywed dust
all over you.

263
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:15,151
- Oh, my wife.
- Oh, my husband.

264
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,915
- Oh, my wife.
- My husband.

265
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,868
My old ball and chain.

266
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:25,266
You quit squirming and come here.

267
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,108
What is into you?

268
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,310
Not me, yet.

269
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:34,271
Here is your room key.
So you're all set. Room 222.

270
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:36,433
Room key's inside,
and the elevators are to the right.

271
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,552
<i>Mahalo. </i>

272
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,196
Congratulations.

273
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:43,713
Here you go, sir. Have some POG juice.

274
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:45,714
Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?

275
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:47,907
I'm checking in.
My name's Bretter, Peter Bretter,

276
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:49,026
but actually, I don't have a reservation.

277
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:53,072
I just thought I'd take my chances.

278
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:55,546
Bold!

279
00:17:56,237 --> 00:18:00,025
We are all booked up,
but we do have the Kapua suite available.

280
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:02,830
- Okay. How much is that?
- $6,000 a night.

281
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,753
- Wow.
- Beautiful views.

282
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,788
I can imagine.
That's a little bit out of my price range.

283
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,589
Sorry.

284
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:11,992
That's a shame. This is a beautiful

285
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:14,906
hotel.

286
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:18,590
<i>Oh, yeah, it's Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene. </i>

287
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:20,915
People are excited that she's here.

288
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:25,554
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up three weeks ago.

289
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,793
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Right. This is fine, right?

290
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:30,670
- Sir?
- It's totally fine. Okay, there she is.

291
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:35,795
- Did she see me? Is she coming over here?
- Uh-huh. Yup.

292
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,509
I wish I wasn't wearing this fucking shirt.

293
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:40,470
Fair enough.
Why don't you try to unbutton it?

294
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,635
Button it back up.

295
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,396
- Peter!
- Hey.

296
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,147
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

297
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:51,468
Came here to murder you.

298
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,307
Really, what are you doing here?

299
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:58,228
I have been having a tough time,
you know, back in LA.

300
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:01,231
But then I came here, and here you are.

301
00:19:01,717 --> 00:19:03,867
I just think that's too crazy to be...

302
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,386
Hello there, you little sex object.

303
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:09,077
I've lost a shoe.
Have you seen it anywhere?

304
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:13,110
It's like this one, but, you know,
obviously it's the opposite one.

305
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:19,471
Excuse me, missus, I've lost a shoe.
Like this one. It's like this one's fellow.

306
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:22,555
- Sort of the exact opposite, in fact, of that.
Uh-huh.

307
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,952
Not an evil version, but just, you know,

308
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:29,116
a shoe like this, but for the other foot.
Otherwise, I'd have two right...

309
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:30,590
Aldous, this is Peter.

310
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:34,392
Hey, all right, Peter.
Nice to meet you, mate. Aldous.

311
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,673
- Good to meet you, man.
- My ex-boyfriend.

312
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:39,833
Right. Hey, I'm Aldous Snow.

313
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:42,232
I know who you are.
Yeah, you're very, very famous.

314
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:44,234
Yeah, I am. I am for my sins.

315
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,666
So are you staying here, as well?

316
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:48,071
- I'm not, as a matter of fact...
- I'm sorry.

317
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:50,586
Excuse me, Mr Bretter, Ms Marshall,

318
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:54,710
but we were able to book the
Kapua suite for you, sir, for four nights.

319
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:59,030
- You were?
- Yes, sir.

320
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:03,075
- Marvellous.
- Perfect. Perfect amount of time.

321
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:05,553
Listen, if you wanna have dinner with us
one of those nights...

322
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:06,997
- Aldous.
... feel very...

323
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,073
No.

324
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:10,348
That's very gentlemanly of you,
but you two enjoy your trip.

325
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:12,434
I'll be just fine on my own.

326
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,026
- All right, Peter.
- The Kapua suite...

327
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:18,708
- Have a good trip, Pete.
- I like your shirt. It's colourful.

328
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,237
- Bye.
- Bye now.

329
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:22,913
Ta-ta. I was wearing two shoes
this morning, right?

330
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:30,507
Thank you. Thank you for bailing me out.
I still can't afford that room.

331
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,692
Nobody can.
It's for, like, Oprah or, like, Céline Dion.

332
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:36,016
Really, it's not a big deal.

333
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:38,531
So you can stay in the suite,
but since you're not technically a guest,

334
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:40,732
you have to clean up after yourself.

335
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:43,296
Otherwise, here is your room key

336
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:46,014
and enjoy your stay.

337
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:49,172
Why are you doing this for me?

338
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:54,014
She's here with some guy already?
Kind of messed up.

339
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,781
- Right?
- Yeah.

340
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,860
- Thank you.
- Really, it's not a big deal.

341
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:00,256
Go enjoy yourself.

342
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,135
Rachel Jansen.
A thousand times, thank you,

343
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,382
- you know what I mean...
- Go enjoy yourself.

344
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:07,931
<i>- This is a disaster!
Calm down, man. </i>

345
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:09,896
<i>Are there other hotels on the island?</i>

346
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:11,296
Of course there are other hotels,

347
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,299
but I'm not leaving here,
it'll look like I'm running away.

348
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:16,573
Wait. Why are you whispering?
You're not following them, are you?

349
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:17,771
I had a girlfriend, right?

350
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,815
And Liam and Noel Gallagher
both had it off with her right in front of me,

351
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,216
so that's similar.

352
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:24,741
And that was a bit awkward, actually.

353
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:27,660
So if you do wanna change hotels,
I quite understand.

354
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,171
No, no, I'm not changing hotels.

355
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:32,418
Stop following
and just go back to your room, Peter.

356
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,498
<i>- They're gone!
- Why are you looking for them?</i>

357
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:36,374
<i>- I don't know.
- You're acting like an idiot. </i>

358
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:38,333
<i>Run! Get out of there! Go to your room!</i>

359
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,418
<i>- What do you think they're doing?
- Peter, go. </i>

360
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,339
Oh, God! Okay, there they are.

361
00:21:42,462 --> 00:21:44,054
<i>- There they are, I see them.
- Go back to your room, Peter. </i>

362
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:45,695
Peter, go back to your room.
Go back to your room, Peter.

363
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:46,811
I'm going in.

364
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,534
<i>Go back to your room, Peter.
Are you listening to me?</i>

365
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,732
<i>Peter, go back to your room.
Peter, Peter, Peter... </i>

366
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,011
<i>Hey!</i>

367
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,093
Hey, nice room.

368
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:56,735
<i>Go!</i>

369
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,173
I am in the Kapua suite.

370
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:02,055
<i>What are you doing? Sucker!</i>

371
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:03,331
Have fun.

372
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,738
<i>Listen, you piece of shit!</i>

373
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:11,301
<i>You're an idiot. Back to your room, Peter.
Peter, back to your room. </i>

374
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:14,536
Did you enjoy that?

375
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:17,096
<i>- Did you like what you saw?
- That hurt a lot. </i>

376
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:20,134
But I know Sarah,
and I'm pretty sure I just ruined her day.

377
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:37,013
<i>You know
how we thought the killer masturbated</i>

378
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:39,178
<i>before he committed each homicide?</i>

379
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,940
<i>That's the theory. </i>

380
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:43,132
<i>Take a look at the microscope. </i>

381
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:48,135
<i>Oh, yeah, looks like where he's going,</i>

382
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:51,810
<i>he'll need to know how to masturbate. </i>

383
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:04,577
Oh, God!

384
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:10,939
<i>- Hello.
Hey, Peter?</i>

385
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:14,058
<i>- Sarah?
- No. </i>

386
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:17,333
It's Rachel Jansen, from the front desk.

387
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:22,055
<i>- Hey!
- Hey, what's going on up there?</i>

388
00:23:22,182 --> 00:23:25,254
I'm getting complaints
about a woman crying hysterically.

389
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:28,180
Yeah, you know what, I hear her, too,

390
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:31,419
and it sounds like
she's having such a hard time.

391
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,136
I think it's coming from the floor above me.

392
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,139
You're on the top floor.

393
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:39,899
I'll try to keep it down.

394
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,811
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you have a nice night. </i>

395
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:43,977
<i>Okay. </i>

396
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:02,141
I would love to sell you some weed, Jeremy,
but I'm at my fucking job right now.

397
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:06,301
Obviously, because you called me at work,
you know that I'm at my place of work.

398
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:08,253
So I can't just leave here
and sell you some weed.

399
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,612
I can sell you some weed when I'm done.

400
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:14,132
<i>Hold on, I gotta call you back.
Mahalo, all right. </i>

401
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:16,412
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey.

402
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,134
I'd just like to grab some dinner, please.

403
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:21,095
- Okay, great. Is your wife gonna meet you?
- No.

404
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:23,501
Your girlfriend?

405
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:26,892
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

406
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:31,256
- You're just by yourself?
- Yeah.

407
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:33,010
Sucks.

408
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:36,373
Okay, so just one. Here's your wine list
and your menu. Come on.

409
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:37,855
Do you want, like, a magazine
or something?

410
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:40,052
It's gonna be boring
if you're just sitting by yourself.

411
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:41,297
I'll be all right. Thank you.

412
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:43,572
I just would be so depressed.

413
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:44,976
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

414
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,057
Thank you.

415
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:50,412
The best thing is,
you have the greatest table in the house.

416
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:52,578
- Oh, yeah?
- That's Aldous Snow right there.

417
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:54,693
I know. I know, dude. I know.

418
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:56,853
- I'm gonna ask him. I'll ask him politely.
- No, please don't, please.

419
00:24:58,142 --> 00:24:59,131
Mate!

420
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:02,457
Why don't you come over and sit with us?
You'll be very welcome.

421
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:05,654
No, thank you. I need a drink.

422
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:08,858
Would you guys like a drink?

423
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:11,177
Well, no, actually, because...

424
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:14,898
Seven years clean.
That's what this tattoo denotes.

425
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:17,252
Seven years free from drugs and alcohol.

426
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,498
If I have just one sip of wine,

427
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:23,331
by the end of the evening,
I'll be, like, rimming waiters for their tips

428
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:24,577
just to get me hands on a rock.

429
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:26,738
You know what I mean? Nasty.

430
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:30,376
I heard that.
- Hey, what's up, man?

431
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,494
How are you enjoying
your vegetable medley?

432
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:33,975
It's mundane.

433
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:36,931
It is mundane. It's great, I know.

434
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:38,620
Will you marry me?

435
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:40,859
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yes!

436
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:42,535
- She said yes!
- Beautiful.

437
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,570
Congratulations!

438
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:50,534
I'm so excited! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

439
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:52,497
Peter!

440
00:25:55,062 --> 00:25:56,290
What's up?

441
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,933
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.

442
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:00,575
Yeah, I'm good.

443
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:05,377
Look, did you follow me here?
Did my assistant tell you I was coming?

444
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:06,821
- No.
- Did you talk to her?

445
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:10,935
No, I didn't talk to your assistant.
It's not all about you, you know.

446
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:15,499
Hawaii is a beautiful place.
People come here, usually not to follow you.

447
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:18,456
So you're really staying?
You're gonna stay?

448
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:22,211
Yeah, I think so. I really like it here.
I feel at home here.

449
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:23,935
I just love it.

450
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:26,575
Yeah, you should stay.

451
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:28,897
I appreciate your consideration.

452
00:26:29,222 --> 00:26:31,690
Sounds like Aldous probably
shared a lot of needles,

453
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:34,131
so thank you for dating him after me.

454
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,775
- I appreciate that.
- Hmm.

455
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:40,851
- Hope you have a really good time here.
- Have a great dinner.

456
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:42,210
Thank you.

457
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:44,781
Groupie whore.

458
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:46,735
Psycho stalker.

459
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:51,653
You know what? It's vacation.
I think I'll just take a piña colada, please.

460
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:00,980
Look at this guy.

461
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:03,690
Look at this guy.

462
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,340
Not us, buddy. Right? Not us.

463
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:12,137
<i>I'm on Sex and the City.
What's up, Miranda?</i>

464
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:16,981
I'm Samantha. I have sex with everyone.

465
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,979
Maybe it's a good thing that they're here.

466
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:21,855
You know what I mean?
Maybe this is a challenge from God

467
00:27:21,982 --> 00:27:23,938
for me to forget her. You know?

468
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:28,135
Or maybe it's a sign from God
that you should be with her.

469
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,580
I love her show.

470
00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:34,253
When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.

471
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,577
What the hell is wrong with you two?
You gotta move on.

472
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:38,772
I hear you say that, but it's not that easy.

473
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,972
It's that easy. Promise you it is.

474
00:27:41,102 --> 00:27:42,740
I lived in South Central.

475
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:45,501
South Central. And I hated it.

476
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,816
That's why I moved to Oahu.

477
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:49,058
Now I can name you
over 200 different kinds of fish.

478
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:50,740
- No, you can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

479
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:52,181
- Do it.
- Yeah, you cannot.

480
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:57,137
G. Ghost pipefish, grill fish, goaler fish
grouper fish, greenback...

481
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:58,900
What's the state fish of Hawaii?

482
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:00,535
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.

483
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:02,254
- Yeah, bitch.
- Hey.

484
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:05,490
- You ready?
- Yeah, just gonna close up.

485
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:12,011
Hello, Mr Bretter, Mr Brayden.
Where's your wife, sir?

486
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:14,692
She is in bed.

487
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:16,653
How are things going with the lady?

488
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:20,775
<i>Not awesome.
She's complicated, like The Da Vinci Code,</i>

489
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:24,341
you know, but harder to crack.

490
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:29,291
But life is full of lessons.
You learn something new every day.

491
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,502
Wonder what I'm going to learn tomorrow.

492
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:35,977
Well.

493
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,935
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

494
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:39,097
Good night, sir.

495
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:41,782
Off to find the mythical clitoris.

496
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:48,050
So, Peter, were you able to get
that crying lady out of your room?

497
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,661
'Cause I could send someone up,
if you want.

498
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:52,500
- Oh, you could?
- Yeah.

499
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:55,896
That's very funny. It is.

500
00:28:57,022 --> 00:29:00,981
Well, listen, Sarah Marshall Show sucks.
Who cares?

501
00:29:01,102 --> 00:29:03,616
I do the music for that programme.

502
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:07,171
Did I mention that the music rocks?

503
00:29:08,702 --> 00:29:12,172
That's very sweet of you.
That's very sweet of you to say.

504
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:14,258
You don't have to say that, though.
It's not music.

505
00:29:14,382 --> 00:29:16,896
There's no melody, it's just tones.

506
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,978
Just dark, ominous tones.

507
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:23,699
"The masturbating dog killer
is on the loose again.

508
00:29:23,822 --> 00:29:26,382
"He'll kill the owner,
but at least the dogs are happy. "

509
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,576
I'm no Aldous Snow, I guess, you know.

510
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:42,941
<i>
Time to start the music</i>

511
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:45,139
<i>All gonna light the light</i>

512
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:49,456
<i>Yeah, yeah, gonna get things started
on The Muppet Show tonight</i>

513
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,422
- Whipped cream or berry?
- Whipped cream.

514
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:04,219
Here we are, sir. Have a wonderful breakfast.

515
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,857
What a lovely table, so close to the buffet.

516
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:09,337
<i>I'm glad you like it. Mahalo. </i>

517
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:14,814
Good morning, sir.
Can I start you with anything?

518
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:16,057
Orange juice, coffee?

519
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:19,492
What about, like, some pineapple juice
with a little bit of rum on the side.

520
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:23,331
Of course. I like your style. Cocktail guy.

521
00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:25,339
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

522
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:27,293
We've already reserved
the sea kayak for noon.

523
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:30,175
Honey, I know that,
but you know that I wanted to see...

524
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:33,658
- Hey. Hello there, friend.
- Hey.

525
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:36,091
How are you guys? How was your evening?

526
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:37,496
- Great.
- Awesome.

527
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:40,216
- I can't feel anything.
- All right.

528
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:42,972
- Does that feel good?
- I still can't feel anything.

529
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:45,172
Okay, 'cause it hurts me.

530
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,975
- Would you do that for me?
- Yeah.

531
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:52,497
- Yeah.
- No, no, no. No.

532
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:55,820
God put our mouths on our head
for a reason. No!

533
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:00,491
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

534
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:06,217
- Is everything okay with...
- Waffles.

535
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:12,773
- Here you go, sir. Breakfast of champions.
- Oh, thank you.

536
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:17,339
And don't tell anybody, but...
A little extra love for you.

537
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:20,057
Thank you.

538
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,457
- Take it easy.
- You, too.

539
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:36,332
- Hi.
- Hi.

540
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:37,807
This is the yoga place, yeah?

541
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:41,051
Yes. But there's no alcohol allowed
in the studio.

542
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:45,773
Oh, no, I mean, obviously.
This is just pineapple juice.

543
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:50,250
Well, there's no outside drinks
allowed in the studio.

544
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:52,533
- Can I set it down?
- Sure.

545
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:54,804
- Cool, thank you.
- I like your hat.

546
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:57,892
- Thank you.
- Please remove it before class.

547
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:03,526
Hey, everyone,
why don't you all grab your mats?

548
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:09,566
<i>Sorry, I recognise you from the cover
of Namaste Magazine. I'm a huge fan. </i>

549
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,844
Thank you. That's so sweet of you to say.

550
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:15,523
I appreciate that.
Obviously, I don't do yoga for recognition.

551
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:19,363
Right, of course you wouldn't.
Then stop being so good at it.

552
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:23,608
That's very flexible. That's nice.

553
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,811
- And, you, I recognise you from your show.
- Thank you.

554
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:31,243
You seem much taller on your show.

555
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:34,249
- I'm not.
- No, I know.

556
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,530
Okay, if you just wanna start
by bringing your palms into your chest.

557
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:43,283
Today we're gonna start with
the Surya Namaskar, or Sun Salutation.

558
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:45,450
Let's take a deep inale in.

559
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:48,005
Exhale and release the hands.

560
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,807
Inale, arms up to the sky. Continue.

561
00:32:51,814 --> 00:32:54,612
Good, exhale and folding forward.

562
00:32:55,294 --> 00:32:59,253
Strong, strong backs. Good, excellent.

563
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:01,126
Remember this is not a competition,

564
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:03,529
although you two seem
to be the best in the class.

565
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:05,963
Excellent. Perfect form, you two, perfect.

566
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:08,654
Coming up into downward-facing dog.

567
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:11,444
Good. It's really important in this pose,

568
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:14,691
that you arch your back
and keep it flat at the same time.

569
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:17,248
I feel like those are opposing ideas.

570
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:21,413
No, they're not, 'cause you're arching
your back up while it's flat.

571
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:22,569
Okay.

572
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:29,013
Good, yeah, sweat it out.
Sweat out all the toxins from this morning.

573
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:31,370
- Come on, lady.
- My name is Prana,

574
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:33,724
and I know that wasn't just juice.

575
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:38,211
You don't really need any adjusting,
so I'm just gonna do this for myself.

576
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:40,844
Just to learn from your body,

577
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:42,732
memorize your body.

578
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,968
- Good. Strong legs.
- Come on.

579
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:48,771
Perfect skin and form.

580
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:52,646
Okay, class, I'd like to now
move into a tripod headstand.

581
00:33:52,774 --> 00:33:54,446
This is more of an advanced pose,

582
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,213
so if you don't feel comfortable
or strong enough,

583
00:33:57,334 --> 00:34:00,883
please feel free to just lay on your mat
in child's pose.

584
00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:02,242
I got it.

585
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,332
All right, so let's all come down to our mats.

586
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:08,491
Get in a prep position
for the tripod headstand.

587
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:09,649
If you don't feel comfortable,

588
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:12,766
there's no shame
in just laying on your mat in child's pose.

589
00:34:12,894 --> 00:34:14,293
Lady, I got it.

590
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:17,167
Good, so let's prep to come up. Good.

591
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:21,486
Sir, if you just want to lay down
in child's pose.

592
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:22,569
Now, you all heard me say,

593
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,606
"If you want to be in child's pose,
that's okay. "

594
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,690
- Just in case he gets hurt.
- Bring it, bring it.

595
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:29,930
I don't want you to break your neck.

596
00:34:30,054 --> 00:34:31,533
- What's up?
- Just relax.

597
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,485
My legs, that's what.

598
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,650
We're doing quiet headstands today.

599
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,572
I'm doing a handstand, motherfucker!
I'm doing a handstand.

600
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,252
Okay, you know, why don't we just release.

601
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:41,648
Thank God.

602
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:44,408
Good, everybody. Good.

603
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:49,569
Hey.

604
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,253
Are you Chuck?

605
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:54,605
Oh, man, you know,
they won't change that flyer.

606
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:58,085
That's my mainland name.
My Hawaiian name is Koonu.

607
00:34:58,454 --> 00:34:59,728
Cool, sorry.

608
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:01,003
No, it's all good.

609
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:04,012
Does Koonu have some, like,
cool Hawaiian meaning?

610
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:05,886
It means Chuck.

611
00:35:06,014 --> 00:35:07,447
I plugged it into a database.

612
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:10,646
There's a thing you can go on,
on the Internet, you just type in your name,

613
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:11,763
and it just says it.

614
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:14,727
What's your name?

615
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,046
- I'm Peter.
- Peter.

616
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:17,651
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna give you a Hawaiian name.

617
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, great.

618
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,731
Pepiopi.

619
00:35:25,852 --> 00:35:28,047
- Great.
- Pepiopi, looks like you've got a little pain

620
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:29,924
behind those eyes.

621
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:33,124
Yeah, maybe a little.

622
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,888
There's really only one cure for that.

623
00:35:36,012 --> 00:35:37,001
What's that?

624
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:38,724
Weed. You got any?

625
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:43,207
- No.
- Well, then let's go surfing.

626
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:49,249
Okay, when we're out there,
I want you to ignore your instincts.

627
00:35:49,372 --> 00:35:52,330
I'm gonna be your instincts.
Koonu will be your instincts.

628
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:53,805
Don't do anything.

629
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:56,162
Don't try to surf, don't do it.

630
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:59,247
The less you do, the more you do.

631
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:01,602
Let's see you pop up. Pop it up!

632
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:06,561
That's not it at all.

633
00:36:06,692 --> 00:36:08,125
Do less. Get down. Try less. Do it again.

634
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,407
Pop up.

635
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,650
No, too slow. Do less.

636
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:14,921
Pop up.

637
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:16,487
Pop up.

638
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:18,762
You're doing too much. Do less. Pop down.

639
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,041
Pop up now.

640
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:21,446
Stop! Get down. Get down there.

641
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:23,563
Remember, don't do anything.

642
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,810
Nothing. Pop up.

643
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:29,885
Well, you... No, you gotta do more than that,

644
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:31,081
'cause you're just laying right out.

645
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:32,167
It looks like you're boogie-boarding.

646
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,328
Just do it. Feel it. Pop up.

647
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:38,685
Yeah. That wasn't quite it,
but we're gonna figure it out, out there.

648
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:39,801
Let's go surfing, come on.

649
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,809
Everybody's learning how, come on and...

650
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:44,127
<i> The weather outside is weather</i>

651
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:47,683
How long you lived out here?

652
00:36:47,812 --> 00:36:50,565
Man, I don't know. I quit wearing a watch
when I moved out here.

653
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:52,967
- Wow, that's so cool.
- Yeah.

654
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:57,005
No, like my cell phone has a clock on it,
so I don't really need it.

655
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,726
Right, so it's basically the same thing.

656
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:03,369
- How old are you?
- I don't really believe in age or numbers,

657
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:06,165
you know, I don't...
I mean, if you had to put a number on it,

658
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,601
I guess I'd be 44.

659
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:11,967
Fuck!

660
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:14,882
Thanks for taking me out here.

661
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,845
This is the first time I've felt good
in three weeks or so.

662
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,486
You need to get back on that board
is what you need to do.

663
00:37:21,612 --> 00:37:23,364
- Yeah?
- Hey, here's the deal.

664
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,845
When life gives you lemons,

665
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:27,088
just say, "Fuck the lemons," and bail.

666
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,772
Yeah. No. You said it, totally.

667
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:31,848
You gotta just pull yourself up
by your wetsuit,

668
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:32,927
get back on that board...

669
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,531
Hey, look, man,
if you're attacked by a shark,

670
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,051
are you gonna give up surfing?

671
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,764
Probably, yeah.

672
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:40,486
Let's go in, all right. Tacos are on me.

673
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:43,442
Can you try to listen
to what I'm saying to you, Brian?

674
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:45,961
I'm confused and I don't know what to do.

675
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,320
<i>What's up with that hat?</i>

676
00:37:47,452 --> 00:37:49,966
<i>What are you
in the Buena Vista Social Club?</i>

677
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:51,207
This is a nice hat.

678
00:37:51,332 --> 00:37:53,926
<i>What member of the Brat Pack are you?</i>

679
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,885
<i>You look like one of those guys
suspected of killing JFK.</i>

680
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:59,162
That's very funny. That's great.

681
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:01,169
<i>Tell him to make friends. </i>

682
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,722
<i>You need to get out there
and make some friends, man. </i>

683
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:05,331
Is Liz there right now?

684
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,488
<i>No, no, she's not in here, buddy. </i>

685
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:08,647
I just heard her.

686
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:10,091
<i>She's gone. </i>

687
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,483
Who are you looking at?

688
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:13,687
<i>What?</i>

689
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:15,404
Is she still... Hi, Liz.

690
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:19,161
<i>No. I swear on my mother's grave, it...
Okay, it was Liz. </i>

691
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:21,403
<i>She wasn't here the entire time. </i>

692
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,568
<i>Go out and meet people.
We meet people all the time... </i>

693
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,091
<i>- All the time on vacation.
- Constantly. </i>

694
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:28,045
I've tried, all right,
there's a couple of dudes here,

695
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,208
but they're kind of weird.

696
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:32,284
<i>Just be friendly. </i>

697
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:33,481
<i>Iron your shirt. </i>

698
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:34,931
<i>Iron your shirt, look sharp. </i>

699
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:36,644
<i>Even your T-shirts. </i>

700
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:39,600
There is this girl at the front desk
who's pretty cute.

701
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:43,005
<i>Oh, yeah. You know what?
Go have another dirty one night stand. </i>

702
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:44,804
<i>That worked out so well before. </i>

703
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:47,685
What do you want from me?
You just told me I need to meet people.

704
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:50,201
<i>Ask her out.
Maybe that's what he needs, is a rebound. </i>

705
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:52,129
<i>He's had plenty of chances
for rebounds. This isn't... </i>

706
00:38:52,252 --> 00:38:53,321
<i>Can we get on the same team here?</i>

707
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:56,364
<i>Okay, I'm sorry.
We're on the same team. Sorry. </i>

708
00:38:57,612 --> 00:38:59,250
<i>You should go on a date with this girl. </i>

709
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:00,646
Well, maybe I'll ask her out then.

710
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,569
<i>- Yes.
- My wife says so. </i>

711
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:05,691
<i>- Hey, I'm in Hawaii, too!
Oh, that's neat. </i>

712
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,804
<i>Aloha, bitches!</i>

713
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:10,251
That's very cool.

714
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:15,767
They're not Native Americans, Brian.

715
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:19,241
<i>- Bri...
- What are you doing?</i>

716
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:21,283
<i>- The luha. Is that right?
- Oh, yeah. </i>

717
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,727
<i>It's called the hula. </i>

718
00:39:22,852 --> 00:39:24,524
<i>- Luau?
- No, hula. </i>

719
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:25,607
<i>You're doing a luau?</i>

720
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:40,567
- Hey.
- Hey.

721
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:41,841
- Peter.
- Wow.

722
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:46,244
You look beautiful.
I mean, that's a beautiful dress.

723
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:47,327
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

724
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:48,726
This'll be fun.

725
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,001
<i>Lei?</i>

726
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:57,125
May I help you with something else, Peter?

727
00:39:57,412 --> 00:39:59,289
No, I'll just grab a drink.
I'm just gonna head inside.

728
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:01,687
- Happy 4th of July!
- Thank you.

729
00:40:03,972 --> 00:40:04,927
<i>Aloha!</i>

730
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:20,049
- You done here?
- No, actually, I just sat down,

731
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:21,924
I'm just getting started.
It's delicious, though, thank you.

732
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,963
I'll just go fuck myself.

733
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:25,844
<i>- Sorry, what?
- Mahalo. </i>

734
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:29,926
Hi, Peter.

735
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:33,210
Hey. Hey, bro.

736
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,531
- Hi.
- Hey, all right.

737
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,404
Excuse me. Excuse me.

738
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:41,490
Everybody, can I have your attention
for one second, please.

739
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:44,365
We have a very special guest
with us here, today.

740
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:48,565
He is the lead singer
of the band, Infant Sorrow,

741
00:40:49,252 --> 00:40:52,722
one of my favourite musicians of all time.
He's so awesome.

742
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:55,762
Please, please, let's take...

743
00:40:56,292 --> 00:41:00,331
Let's see if we can get him up here,
Mr Aldous Snow. Please, come on.

744
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:02,287
Share your gift.

745
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:03,606
Duty calls and all that.

746
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:07,327
I'm trying to be incognito, it's weird.
It's like work to me, this is no fun.

747
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:09,044
Hey! Thank you!

748
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:19,727
Thank you.
What a lovely introduction.

749
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,161
What an eccentric and confident young man.

750
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:25,648
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a very beautiful woman that's here today.

751
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:28,366
It's Miss Sarah Marshall, there she is.

752
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,407
Look at her, blimey!

753
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:40,769
<i> Old as ancient skies</i>

754
00:41:41,054 --> 00:41:43,614
<i>I've had these wandering eyes</i>

755
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:46,609
<i>but you took me by surprise</i>

756
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:49,009
<i>when you let me inside you</i>

757
00:41:50,894 --> 00:41:52,486
<i>Inside you</i>

758
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:55,205
<i>Inside you</i>

759
00:41:55,454 --> 00:41:56,853
This went from 6:00 to midnight.

760
00:41:56,974 --> 00:42:01,206
<i>Teach me how to grow
while I'm moving inside of you</i>

761
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,606
<i>Inside of you</i>

762
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:07,724
<i>- Inside you
- Inside you</i>

763
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:11,567
<i>I long to be, is it wrong to be</i>

764
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:13,850
<i>inside of you</i>

765
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:18,767
<i>Inside of you the restless find their dreams</i>

766
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:24,523
<i>Inside of you this king has found his queen</i>

767
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:31,889
Hey.

768
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:33,129
You're from the breakfast buffet, right?

769
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:34,209
- Yeah.
- Whipped cream or berries?

770
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:35,323
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Peter.

771
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:38,109
- Kemo.
- Kemo.

772
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,349
- Good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet, you, man.

773
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:42,703
- Have a beer.
- Thanks. Thank you.

774
00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:46,466
Sarah Marshall.

775
00:42:46,593 --> 00:42:47,628
Yes.

776
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:51,109
How do you know
I was dating Sarah Marshall?

777
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,588
Dwayne told me. Chuck told me.

778
00:42:54,353 --> 00:42:55,547
Even Rachel told me.

779
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:59,507
I heard about it from everybody.
You gotta stop talking about it.

780
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,949
<i>It's like The Sopranos. </i>

781
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:03,301
It's over.

782
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,465
Find a new show.

783
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:08,466
You need a hug.

784
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,186
Come here.

785
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:13,306
Oh, thank you.

786
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,105
You're awfully nice.

787
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:18,873
<i>I gotta go.
I'm prepping the pig for tomorrow's luau. </i>

788
00:43:18,993 --> 00:43:21,632
You should come and help me.
It'll take your mind off of things.

789
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:23,550
- Yeah? You don't mind?
- No.

790
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:26,746
I mean, I must say I'm a pretty good cook.

791
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:28,262
All right!

792
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,993
I can't! Please don't make me do this!

793
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,188
Do it!

794
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,668
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

795
00:43:42,313 --> 00:43:43,826
You can stop crying now.

796
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:45,511
He's dead already.

797
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:47,386
I'm not crying.

798
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:48,741
You should stop crying.

799
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:50,352
I don't cry. I'm not a baby.

800
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:53,271
Really?
'Cause you look like a gigantic baby.

801
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:56,067
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that at all.

802
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:06,627
Hey.

803
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:11,065
Listen, would you like to hang out tonight,
like, not in an official hotel function?

804
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:12,421
Yeah. Totally.

805
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:14,987
A bunch of us are going to go to this,
like, little beach thing afterwards.

806
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:17,343
You're totally welcome to come.

807
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,425
Maybe we could go together?

808
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:21,032
Yeah, whatever.

809
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:22,627
I mean we don't have to,
if you don't want to,

810
00:44:22,753 --> 00:44:23,708
I just thought that maybe...

811
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,186
No, listen,
you don't have to make this weird.

812
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:26,985
You either want to go or you don't.

813
00:44:28,513 --> 00:44:30,071
- I would love to.
- Okay.

814
00:44:30,673 --> 00:44:33,233
Awesome. Why don't you go upstairs,
change that shirt,

815
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:36,026
and I'll meet you out front in, like, five?

816
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:48,705
- This is so cool.
- You like it?

817
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,303
So what brought you to Hawaii?

818
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:06,783
- A dude.
- Of course.

819
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,985
A surfer dude. You know, WCT, top 44.

820
00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:14,347
Totally.

821
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:18,263
We were together for two years.

822
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,193
Dropped out of school,
moved out here with him.

823
00:45:21,313 --> 00:45:23,349
Three weeks later,
I caught him cheating on me,

824
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,668
so I moved out, and that's that.

825
00:45:26,673 --> 00:45:28,231
What an asshole.

826
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:30,631
No, he's just a boy.

827
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:36,742
You ever think about going back home,
finishing school, or...

828
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:38,942
No.

829
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:41,584
No. I work at the hotel,

830
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:45,226
doesn't really have to be a future in there.

831
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:47,872
Okay, my turn.

832
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,428
Okay.

833
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:54,266
So, how do you like
writing music for a TV show?

834
00:45:57,073 --> 00:45:59,303
It's great, you know. People are great.

835
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:02,311
It's great to have a steady paycheque.
It's... I'm very lucky.

836
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:03,422
Oh, my God, you hate it.

837
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,669
I fucking hate it so much.

838
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:08,188
So then, do something about it.

839
00:46:11,753 --> 00:46:12,742
Excuse me.

840
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:15,910
I'm just saying, if you hate something,
change it.

841
00:46:16,033 --> 00:46:17,591
- Don't dwell.
- Well, I'm trying.

842
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:22,147
I'm actually working on a rock opera.

843
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,512
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

844
00:46:25,793 --> 00:46:27,909
What's your rock opera about?

845
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:31,541
Dracula.

846
00:46:32,913 --> 00:46:35,586
Yeah, and eternal love, you know.
That's the theme.

847
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:38,989
But I think the two sort of go hand in hand,
you know?

848
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:40,701
And I...

849
00:46:42,673 --> 00:46:45,551
I have this vision of doing it with puppets.

850
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:49,991
I mean, humans also, you know.

851
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:53,661
Why Dracula?

852
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:57,422
Because he's a man like anyone else.
He just wants to be loved.

853
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:59,225
And every time he gets close
to a human woman,

854
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:00,866
he ends up smothering and killing her,

855
00:47:00,993 --> 00:47:03,461
which is a feeling I am familiar with.

856
00:47:03,593 --> 00:47:05,424
What? That's just a joke.

857
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:07,305
- Oh, shit.
- What?

858
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:10,985
My ex. If I run, you run.

859
00:47:12,473 --> 00:47:14,225
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand at all.

860
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:16,071
Fucking motherfucker! Dipshit!

861
00:47:16,193 --> 00:47:17,148
Rachel, what are you doing?

862
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:18,865
I thought I told you
to stay back on your island.

863
00:47:18,993 --> 00:47:19,982
Take it easy, just take it easy.

864
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:21,182
Yeah, you know what?
The deal was over April 9.

865
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:23,383
Well, the deal's back on, motherfucker.

866
00:47:23,513 --> 00:47:25,344
You ain't the chief in this village.
I'm the chief.

867
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:26,462
Of the idiots?

868
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,153
Rachel, let me handle this. I know his friend.
Let me handle this, okay?

869
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:30,706
Go ahead.

870
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,429
Hey, man, you remember me from breakfast?

871
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:36,113
- Oh, yeah, the cocktail guy, that's right.
- Yeah.

872
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:39,191
This ain't the breakfast buffet.
What, you with my girl?

873
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,349
Keeping her warm for me at night, huh?

874
00:47:41,473 --> 00:47:43,350
Hey, what are you doing here?

875
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:48,666
That's right. Just hit him!

876
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:49,987
Rachel, we gotta get out of here. Rachel?

877
00:47:50,113 --> 00:47:52,069
You get what you deserve.

878
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:07,029
Just a boy?
No, that dude was a fucking man.

879
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:10,862
No, no, no. He's an asshole.
I can't believe I ever dated him.

880
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:13,511
- You went nuts.
- Yeah.

881
00:48:13,993 --> 00:48:16,427
You guys are dysfunctional.

882
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:19,262
<i>You were like one of those girls
from Flavour of Love. </i>

883
00:48:19,393 --> 00:48:20,712
- From what?
- You were.

884
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,585
"I'll kill you. I'll kill you. "

885
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:25,710
Okay, I'm gonna go get us another round.

886
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:27,710
I'll grab it. It's no big deal.

887
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:31,269
You don't have to dote on me.
I'm not that type of girl.

888
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:45,112
You look so hot.

889
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:47,428
<i>Give me Crime Scene.
Give me dirty Crime Scene girl. </i>

890
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:49,589
André the Giant, out of the shot, please.

891
00:48:49,713 --> 00:48:51,624
Mutombo, out of the shot, come on.

892
00:49:18,913 --> 00:49:22,064
Did you know that there's a picture
of you flashing,

893
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:23,626
hanging in the men's room?

894
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:26,586
Yeah. I hate it so much.

895
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,181
My jackass boyfriend made me do it.

896
00:49:29,753 --> 00:49:31,584
Keoki took it, right there.

897
00:49:31,713 --> 00:49:33,704
And I asked him to take it down,

898
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:37,064
but he said that it would ruin
the balance of the collage.

899
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:39,631
Do you want me to try
to get it down for you?

900
00:49:39,753 --> 00:49:43,268
No. No, no, no, he'll kill you.
Like, really kill you.

901
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:47,428
But I have a surprise for you.

902
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,107
Really, what?

903
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:50,427
We're gonna take a quick break.

904
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:52,464
Tonight we have a special guest
from the mainland,

905
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:55,312
singing a song from his Dracula musical,

906
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:58,466
please welcome to the stage,
Mr Peter Bretter.

907
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:01,382
Peter!

908
00:50:01,513 --> 00:50:03,071
Yeah! Go get them, tiger!

909
00:50:03,193 --> 00:50:04,148
Please don't.

910
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:06,581
Peter!

911
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:09,228
- Rachel...
- Dracula! Peter!

912
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:15,621
Get them!

913
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:16,748
What's up?

914
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:24,432
Thank you.

915
00:50:27,113 --> 00:50:28,512
You know, I could play something else.

916
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:30,032
I just think out of context this might be...

917
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,745
Dracula musical!

918
00:50:33,593 --> 00:50:34,912
Thank you.

919
00:50:54,273 --> 00:50:58,585
<i> It's getting kind of hard to believe

932
00:52:17,193 --> 00:52:18,467
Awesome!

933
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:20,352
Thank you.

934
00:52:24,153 --> 00:52:25,142
Thank you.

935
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:28,351
So, I had a really, really great time tonight.

936
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:30,543
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I mean, it got a little wild.

937
00:52:30,673 --> 00:52:32,470
- "A little"? You can say that.
- Yeah.

938
00:52:32,593 --> 00:52:35,187
But it was really fun,
and you're so cool, and it was...

939
00:52:35,313 --> 00:52:36,905
Thank you for taking me out.

940
00:52:37,033 --> 00:52:38,591
No, I had a great time. Thank you.

941
00:52:40,273 --> 00:52:41,831
- You did?
- Yeah.

942
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:47,784
I'm sorry.

943
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:51,872
I'm sorry, I just... I don't...
I just don't wanna complicate things.

944
00:52:51,993 --> 00:52:53,312
- No, of course!
- Yeah?

945
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:56,425
No, no, no. Totally. I totally get that.

946
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:58,589
- I had a great time.
- A handshake?

947
00:52:58,713 --> 00:53:01,750
- Well, I don't know. Okay.
- All right, all right.

948
00:53:01,873 --> 00:53:04,387
- All right. Get home safe.
- You, too.

949
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,270
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

Hey, guys.

00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,429
Hey, man. I'm Koonu.

956
00:53:38,153 --> 00:53:41,270
Yeah. No, I remember. I'm Peter.
We took a surf lesson together.

957
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:44,703
Yeah, you're that guy
that works with Kaiser Permanente.

958
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:48,189
No, I'm Peter.
We had a nice talk out on the water.

959
00:53:48,313 --> 00:53:49,712
That's cool.

960
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,664
Okay, can I just say something?

961
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:57,103
- I went on a date tonight with Rachel, right?
- That wasn't a date.

962
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,064
She's in customer service, dude.

963
00:53:59,193 --> 00:54:01,149
She took you out for charity.

964
00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:05,346
It was a date, okay? Trust me.
I know a date, and that was a date.

965
00:54:05,473 --> 00:54:06,588
I bet you think strippers like you, too.

966
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:07,702
- That's really not necessary.
- It's true.

967
00:54:09,553 --> 00:54:12,465
Don't waste your time, man.
Believe me, it is a nowhere road. I know.

968
00:54:12,593 --> 00:54:15,391
Did you see her ex-boyfriend?
He is ridiculous.

969
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:17,629
Who, Greg? I love Greg, man.

970
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:20,347
I saw him beat up a guy with a starfish.

971
00:54:20,473 --> 00:54:23,351
- Okay, that's just ridiculous.
- That guy was me.

972
00:54:23,473 --> 00:54:26,226
Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?

973
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:28,787
Getting as much sex
as he possibly can ever have.

974
00:54:28,913 --> 00:54:30,551
Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?

975
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:32,106
Come on.

976
00:54:33,393 --> 00:54:39,025
The wife wants me to do certain things
that I find inappropriate.

977
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:41,872
Let me just say
that if God was a city planner,

978
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:45,622
he would not put a playground
next to a sewage system.

979
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:51,667
We're trying to fuck,
but we're not having fun fucking.

980
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:55,581
We're just, like...
I'm stabbing her private parts,

981
00:54:58,113 --> 00:55:01,423
and it's not fun, and it causes anxiety.
Fucking is...

982
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:03,072
And then when you're not fucking...

983
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:05,753
- Hey, someone's gotta stop him.
- You're the butt of a joke.

984
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:08,228
Fucking this ring is...

985
00:55:08,353 --> 00:55:09,866
Fuck!

986
00:55:09,993 --> 00:55:11,984
It's gonna be all right.

987
00:55:13,713 --> 00:55:14,862
Hi.

988
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:18,662
Hi, do you wanna come back to bed?

989
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:19,942
Sure.

990
00:55:22,793 --> 00:55:24,021
Have fun.

991
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:29,665
I like her hair.
I wonder if the carpet matches her pubes.

992
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:38,871
Julian, what's up?

993
00:55:41,153 --> 00:55:42,108
Oh.

994
00:55:43,113 --> 00:55:44,307
God.

995
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:55,831
The show's been cancelled.

996
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:57,705
That's good, 'cause that's what you wanted.

997
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:00,188
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

998
00:56:01,473 --> 00:56:06,388
It's just... I guess
I thought we had another year left.

999
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:08,549
It seems like we did, and... This'll be good,

1000
00:56:08,673 --> 00:56:11,665
'cause it's been a long-awaited transition
into film for me.

1001
00:56:11,793 --> 00:56:14,910
Don't get me wrong, but it's just...
It's a surprise.

1002
00:56:15,033 --> 00:56:16,591
Come on tour with me.

1003
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:21,264
I'll serenade you every night
in front of thousands of women.

1004
00:56:21,393 --> 00:56:23,031
I didn't know you were going on tour.

1005
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:24,302
Yeah, I'm going in two weeks.

1006
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:28,267
It's like an 18-month tour,
43 countries, Infant Sorrow,

1007
00:56:28,393 --> 00:56:30,384
and it's gonna be a massive tour.

1008
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:35,382
Yeah. I can't come 'cause I have a job.
I'm a working actress.

1009
00:56:35,513 --> 00:56:37,151
Not any more.

1010
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:38,467
You're an unemployed actress, perfect.

1011
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:44,311
You could be the queen of the groupies,
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.

1012
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:46,583
The Sorrow Suckers.

1013
00:56:46,713 --> 00:56:50,023
Sorrow Suckers.
I don't know why they call them that.

1014
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:53,190
Mr and Mrs Snow, sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

1015
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:56,471
The hotel wanted to offer you
some complimentary coconut cake.

1016
00:56:56,633 --> 00:57:00,467
It's from the hotel.
It's definitely not from me personally, so...

1017
00:57:01,673 --> 00:57:03,709
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay, great.

1018
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,984
When were you planning on telling me this?

1019
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:10,549
- I just told you, then.
- Yeah. No, I know.

1020
00:57:10,673 --> 00:57:15,224
But telling me now
isn't really the same as telling me.

1021
00:57:15,353 --> 00:57:17,947
Well, look, you know,
I've not told you I've got genital herpes,

1022
00:57:18,073 --> 00:57:20,303
because it's not inflamed at the moment.

1023
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:22,310
Do you guys want some champagne
with your cake,

1024
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:23,707
or do you want it without your cake?

1025
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,312
I don't drink.

1026
00:57:32,513 --> 00:57:36,665
All right, so I came here
to give you my demo. I just...

1027
00:57:36,793 --> 00:57:39,023
I worship you,
and I just wanted to give you my demo.
