00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,562

up at the leaves...

167
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,198

168
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,469

so happy

169
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,172

171
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:44,683

Erik, if it was
just us,

173
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:51,489

No, Anna, Anna,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

177
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,236
That's the song.

178

That--

<i>Per billion what?</i>

Per billion

It's a beautiful day.

Oh, that.

232
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,904
That was a moment
of weakness.

233

Well, at least we're not
going to get divorced now.

It's too bad
we aren't birds.

237
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,959
I wonder what
they're feeling.

238
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,830
Like their favorite
TV show got canceled.

Aw, shut up.

I was just thinking it
the other day.

243
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,379

I just realized that--

244
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,349
that you're my wife.

245
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,519
It took me practically
till just now

246
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,088

00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,242
Okay.

Woman: Oh, God.

Look, I know

need a favor from you.

268

It's for my wife.
She's in there waiting
to see Dr. Henderson.

269
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,791
They took her
off life support.

270

They took her out of ICU.
We're just waiting, Sarah.

Well, we have
an emergency--

272
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,698
Well, this is
an emergency!
You understand?!

273
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,835
This is an
emergency, Sarah!
She's dying!

274
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,105
And the doctor's
just taken a three-hour
coffee break.

275
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,209
- Mr. Sachs--
- I'm sorry.

I know you're
a good person.

277
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,446
Esther and I really
think of you

278
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:59,117

like you're really family.

279
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,020
Please,
I'm begging you.
Just come with me.

280
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,922
Help me. Help me
get her to ICU.
Come on.

281
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,457
I'm not sure I'm going
to be able to do that.

282

302

And winds and...

Now listen to me. Listen.
You got to get one.

Not a charcoal filter.
Pure oxygen.

00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,008
What you've gotta watch,
of course, is when you
breed something

507
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,244
more and more
specialized,

508
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,813
it can only survive
under very narrow

509
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,149
and specific conditions.

510
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,318
- ( groans )
- Erik: <i>Here.</i>

511
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,954
Thank you.

512
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,624
- Got something for you.
- No, Grandpa, I'm fine.

513
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:54,825
- No, no, no.
- I'm fine.

514
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:56,593
No, no, you can't
refuse me.

515
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,029
You just can't.
I'm not gonna take no
for an answer,

516
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:02,232
- so you might as well
just stop.
- Okay.

517
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,635
And I wanna tell you
something--

518
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,837
man to man, okay?

519
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,211
No matter how much
a woman may tell you

520
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,079
that she's happy
to support you,

521
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:19,049
that she's not interested
in material things,

522
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,984
she wants you
to be free--

523
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,854
sooner or later,
they all want the
good things in life.

524
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:26,924
- I know, I know.
But Anna isn't like that.
- Well, I'm sure she's not.

525
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,593
I'm not telling you
that she's shallow.

526
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:33,330
Probably is the most
natural, basic instinct
in a woman--

527
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:37,701
actually,
any human being--
make a home,

528
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:40,037
make a nest.

529
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,541
You know, I'm playing
a show at this thing.

530
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,176
It's called
"South by Southwest."

531
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,213
And you know
there's a lot of...

532
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,648
record company people,
and managers go.

533
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,218
That's wonderful.

534
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,656
- I can make a living
playing music.
- I'm sure you can.

535
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,025
And I'm sure you'll
figure it out.

536
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,695
Don't let anybody
pressure you, huh?

537
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,496
Just take
your time.

538
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,366
If there's anything
ever I can do
to help you,

539
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,368
you know I'm here.

540
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,673
So funny--
I was just thinking
this morning

541
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:20,644
that, God,
I have turned into
such a typical "girl."

542
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:24,615
( chuckles )
I never thought
it would happen to me,

543
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,717
but I--
oh, God--

544
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,152
I am completely
obsessed with him.

545
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,188
Beyond obsessed
with him.

546
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,891
I mean, even when
I'm angry or jealous

547
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:37,094
or, I don't know--
maybe that's the same thing--

548
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:40,931
but he leaves for an hour
and I can't stand it.

549
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,867
I don't know
what to do with myself.

550
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,136
I feel
kind of crazy and--

551
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:49,273
( sighs )
that can't be healthy.

552
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:52,643
Well, I'm not sure
it's healthy,

553
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,711
but it is
the way it is.

554
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,780
- Yeah.
- Anna: Yeah?

555
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,049
And I'll tell you
something else.

556
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:02,052
You'd be someplace--
at a party

557
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,488
or a friend's house
or something--

558
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,059
and he'll be over there
talking to somebody.

559
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,995
And you see his face.

560
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,398
And you think,

561
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,602
"He and I
are going to make
some beautiful babies."

562
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,907
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

563
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,076
( cups clink )

564
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,079
You know what?
I don't think
I can take this.

565
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,448
No, no. I told you
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

566
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,483
- No, Grandpa, I can't.
- Oh, Erik, come on.
I got it, you need it.

567
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,987
- What's the difference?
- I always appreciate--

568
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,556
I am not
taking it back.
That's final.

569
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,425
( rips )

570
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,064
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Idiot.</i>

571
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:50,701
You're too good
for my dirty money?

572
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:53,203
You think there wouldn't
be such a thing as war
if it wasn't for me?

573
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:55,939
I got news for you, kid.
There are worse sinners
on this earth

574
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,841
- than your grandfather.
- No, no, no. I don't--

575
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,943
Wait till you have
a child!

576
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,112
Wait till you have
a sick child!

577
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,581
Then you'll lecture me.

578
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,555
Attorney:
<i>And if you have any trouble</i>
<i>at all remembering</i>

579
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,156
<i>or if you aren't sure</i>
<i>of your answer,</i>

580
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,791
<i>just say,</i>
<i>"I don't remember,"</i>

581
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,626
<i>or, "I don't have</i>
<i>any specific recollection."</i>

582
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,129
Now, that last one
actually covers
quite a lot.

583
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,432
If, for instance,
you "sort of" think you
might remember something,

584
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,535
but it's possible
that you aren't
remembering it clearly,

585
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:29,272
it's never perjury
to say, "I don't have
any specific recollection."

586
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:33,510
They were developing
a pathogen.

587
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,379
I know, Mr. Sachs.

588
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:38,015
But the prosecution
won't be asking
about that tonight.

589
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,417
It wasn't even
my division.

590
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:43,653
I offered advice
to my clients

591
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,489
on pharmaceutical
lines.

592
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,357
Okay.

593
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,828
We have
about 15 minutes

594
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,897
<i>until opening</i>
<i>statements.</i>

595
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,666
They just offered me
so much money.

596
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,603
So much.
Millions.

597
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,807
Okay. Mr. Sachs,
look at me.

598
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,312
This trial is not

599
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,181
about how
certain governments

600
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,716
got a hold of
certain weapons

601
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,718
or formulas
for weapons

602
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,220
<i>over 30</i>
<i>years ago.</i>

603
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,790
<i>This trial deals with</i>
<i>the very narrow issue</i>

604
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,292
<i>of whether or not</i>
<i>you violated your contract</i>

605
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,661
<i>with Sichel Systems</i>
<i>by revealing trade secrets,</i>

606
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:27,431
and you didn't
do that.

607
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,633
You didn't
break the terms
of your contract.

608
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:32,302
You're innocent.

609
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,538
Have you had
a child?

610
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:41,344
- No.
- You can't
watch them die.

611
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,981
She lived
another 15 years

612
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,717
and she gave us
our grandson, Erik.

613
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,822
But the prosecution
doesn't need to know
that, do they?

614
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:54,424
I took it.

615
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,360
I took the money.

616
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:01,164
I knew
it was wrong,
but I took it.

617
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,234
My wife is living
in denial,

618
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,837
but I know
it's my fault.

619
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,474
I deserve
to be punished.

620
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,217
We really need
to leave, Mr. Sachs.

621
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,896
Esther:
Oh, my God.

622
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:35,332
Oh-- it's too far.

623
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,367
Sachs:
We'll get there,
we'll get there.

624
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:41,571
Hold on.
If we can find some more
canisters up there,

625
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,208
it's gonna get us
eight days of air,

626
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,677
and the poison
will be gone.

627
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,749
( Esther sighs )

628
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,317
To think
I was so scared

629
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,887
about having
that operation.

630
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,356
And Dr. Henderson
died--

631
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:00,924
Esther, if you're
going to go through

632
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,759
all the ironies
of the situation,

633
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,028
we're going to be talking
another 20 years.
You know that?

634
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,131
I won't say a word.
I don't ever want
to say anything.

635
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,567
What?
What did you say?

636
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:13,270
Excuse me?

637
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,539
You don't want
to say anything?

638
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:19,309
Huh?
You don't wanna
say anything...

639
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:22,379
about my pants?

640
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,216
Something
about my pants?

641
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:29,219
They're too high.
( chuckles )

642
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:32,756
Okay, here we go.

643
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:35,125
Sarah:
<i>Have you been</i>
<i>looking for a job?</i>

644
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:36,626
Man:
Yeah, I've been
looking for a job.

645
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,629
I print out another
175,000 resumes,

646
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:43,066
I change my profile
on another million
job sites.

647
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,569
- I mean, the thing is--
- <i>I even call Human Resources.</i>

648
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,804
I swear to God,
I feel like "Willy Loman."
I said...

649
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,639
( sighs )

650
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:53,376
"If anything comes up,
do me a favor.

651
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,946
Keep my number.
Give me a call."

652
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,182
I mean, you were
getting plenty of work

653
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,017
when you were putting her
through law school.

654
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,852
Yeah. People
used to hire writers.

655
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,355
You can get
any job you want.

656
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,224
Yeah.
One more job.

657
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,559
Pay some bills.

658
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,761
Buy some stuff,
get another job,

659
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,630
pay some more bills,
buy some more stuff--

660
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:16,066
Yeah, but it's that
or what?

661
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,902
Play basketball
with your buddies all day

662
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,238
and let Mia
buy your shirts?

663
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,809
You know what's
interesting to me,
is that why--

664
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,911
instead of printing
a bunch of resumes,

665
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,379
why we all don't
just stop

666
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:33,350
in the middle of
the street and say...

667
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:35,352
"What the hell
is going on here?

668
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:36,920
What is this
all about?"

669
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,457
I mean, why am I
here on this earth,
you know?

670
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,525
- Oh, Len--
- No, I mean it.
I mean it.

671
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,929
Why does the universe
expand for eternity?

672
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,063
Wh-why--

675

We all asked ourselves
those questions

676
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,405
when we were, like,
eight.

677
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,173
Yeah, but why
did we <i>stop</i> asking,
you know?

678

got any answers.

Len:
You know what I just
realized the other day?

688
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,445
We're at some party
at Mia's office

689
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:38,381
and we'd
just gotten in
some stupid fight

690
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:41,418
and we're outside
in the parking lot.

691
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,753
And I just
realized that...

692
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,891
she's my wife.

693
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,595
And I love her.

694
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,499
I mean,
I really love her.

695
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,235
She married me...

696
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:02,105

that depressed, can I?

697
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,774

I hear you.

843
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,973
( faint echo )

844
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:26,042
<i>( wind rustling,</i>
<i>birds chirping )</i>

845
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,518

00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,596

849

<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

850
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,494
Hi.

851
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:30,599
Hi.

852
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,738
- Was I talking
to myself?
- No.

853
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:42,478
I've been feeling
so weird these
past few days.

854
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:47,049
You know...

855
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,052
I see stuff.

856
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:54,090
<i>Out of the corner</i>
<i>of my eye sometimes.</i>

857
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:01,263
I don't even
tell my boyfriend--

858
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,001
my fiancé.

859
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,073
And these
past few days, I...

860
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:14,010
<i>I mean literally,</i>

861
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:17,179
<i>last night,</i>
<i>for a second,</i>

862
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:22,318
<i>it was like there was</i>
<i>nobody left anywhere...</i>

863
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,557
...except animals.

864
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:33,095
Running down the middle
of the street.

865
00:50:33,097 --> 00:50:35,064
( sniffles )

866
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:38,567
God, and Erik was like,

867
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,203
"What?

868
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,507
<i>What are you</i>
<i>staring at?"</i>

869
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,417
You didn't say?

870
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,925
They say
schizophrenia starts

871
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:07,496
when you're, like,

872
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:10,766
19 to 25.

873
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,301
Rick:
<i>You hear voices?</i>

874
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,845
Well, I just heard
a bunch of crows

875
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:26,215
screaming
"War! War!"

876
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:28,184
( chuckles )
Well, they aren't
telling you

877
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:30,886
to jump off any
high buildings, right?

878
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,422
No.

879
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,324
Good.

880
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,929
My name
is Rick.

881
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,498
I'm Anna.

882
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,148
I've considered

883
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,751
the high
building option.

884
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,692
But life is so
absurdly short,
anyway.

885
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,631
Yeah, I've been
thinking that.

886
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,636
Makes you only want to do
the important things.

887
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,773
But what are
the important things?

888
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:42,558
I'm pregnant.

889
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,331
First time
I've told anybody.

890
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,778
- Woman: Greyhound.
- Erik: You got it.

891
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,781
Vodka
and grapefruit.

892
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,957
Erik:
Here you go.

893
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:18,127
Thank you.

894
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:20,129
You don't know
what a Greyhound is?

895
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:23,465
Hey, who got us
this job?

896
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:26,902
So, anyway,
all I'm saying

897
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,103
is marriage
is just

898
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:31,407
all of these
artificial
restrictions.

899
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,542
It's like going on
some radical diet

900
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,844
when you're
not even fat.

901
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:39,949
All I'm saying is,
yes,

902
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:42,418
agreed,
congratulations

903
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,487
Anna is hot.
She's incredibly hot.

904
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,090
And, granted, you're
probably not going to
meet anybody

905
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:49,992
who's that hot
and whatever cool

906
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:52,595
and interesting
and wonderful.

907
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:54,964
Mia:
I don't know
what you're talking about.

908
00:53:54,966 --> 00:53:56,465
You're making
a scene.

909
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:57,967
Well, what is he
looking at, then?

910
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,468
Right now he's
looking at you.

911
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,670
Having dragged me across
the room and yelling at me

912
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:04,940
- in front of
all my coworkers--
- I'm not yelling at you.

913
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:07,710
Can I get a
vodka and tonic?

914
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,484
Brilliant, that's
exactly right.

915
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,253
- Yeah.
- Fucking more alcohol

916
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,388
because that's really
going to help.

917
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,926
Thank you.

918
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,869
See? He probably
thought he was marrying

919
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,671
the most magical,
beautiful girl
on earth.

920
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,275
It's up to you, man.
I'm just saying

921
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,276
you could be dealing
with that kind of shit

922
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,610
for the rest
of your life.

923
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,079
Or I could spend the rest
of my life saying,

924
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:47,283
"I met the one
true love of my life

925
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:49,752
when I was 22 years old
and I was too scared

926
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:53,622
- to ask her to marry me."
- If she is the one true
love of your life.

927
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,059
I mean, there are
billions of people.

928
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,298
( voices overlapping )

929
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,274
No, she's--

930
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:15,144
she's the one
true love of my life.

931
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:17,846
( chuckles softly )
Okay.

932
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,749
So you have the rest
of your life

933
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:23,385
<i>to ask her</i>
<i>to marry you.</i>

934
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,762
( mutters )
Fuck.

935
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,332
( exhales sharply )

936
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:50,412
It happens
every time.

937
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,514
I get dressed up
to come to a thing
like this,

938
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,718
and it's
a fucking disaster.

939
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,421
( sniffles )

940
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,458

Len,

942
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:14,002
none of these people
matter to me.

943
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:25,147
None of these people
mean anything to me

944
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:27,149
except you.

945
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,731

Let's get out
of here.

946
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,772

Ah, fuck.

949
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,693
Oh, God
I need water.

950
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:12,594
Water.

951
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,997
( mutters )
Done.

952
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:25,207
What's this?

953
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,443
<i>I got it</i>
<i>at the museum.</i>

954
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,545
( bottle lid clanking )

955
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,346
It's a trilobite.

956
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:33,248
It's probably like
300 million years old.

957
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,852
And now they
just give them away
with a $50 membership.

958
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:38,587
( laughs )

959
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:41,690
There used to be
billions of 'em.

960
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:44,860
They must have had
a lot of sex.

961
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,864
They couldn't
help themselves.

962
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:50,666
( laughs )

963
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:00,175
They were in love.

964
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:02,211
Or it was
just instinct.

965
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:03,745
( laughs )

966
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:07,082
Same thing,
I guess.

967
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,998
I'd have babies
with you.

968
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,170
I mean, not right
away, but...

969
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,879
we should,
you know?

970
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,082

What?

973
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,124
I never said never.

974
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:53,529
I said, "Don't
marry me if you want
to have children."

975
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:56,231
- ( laughs )
- But you would?

976
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,703
I could.

977
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,911
Yeah, I would.

978
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,218
We should.

979
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,089
- Mia: Right?
- Len: Right.

980
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,596
Think of how beautiful
it would be.

981
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:30,732
"It"?
She. She.

982
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,674
Okay. We will.

983
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,542
You promise?

984
00:59:40,544 --> 00:59:43,145
Not right away.

985
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,748
But someday.

986
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,285
Promise.

01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:36,818
gave Liza 15 more
years of life.

1190
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,755
It gave her Erik.

1191
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,160
What if they
use it, Esther?

1192
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:48,162
What if they use it

1193
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:50,465
and everybody dies?

1194
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:53,434
Well, I think
you're going
completely crazy.

1195
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:54,902
I really do,
you know.

1196
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:58,639
You are not to blame
for everything
in this world,

1197
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:01,909
no matter
how smart you are.

1198
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:04,512
And I'll tell you
something else.

1199
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:06,748
I'm taking a little
offense at this.

1200
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,984
I didn't marry
a murderer.

1201
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:13,755
I married
the kindest,

1202
01:13:13,757 --> 01:13:15,790
gentlest,

1203
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:18,793
most loving man

1204
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:21,496
in the world.

1205
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:27,735
I don't think
you ever knew

1206
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,171
just how much
I love you.

1207
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,584
I swear, it--

1208
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,621
- Esther?
- Ow--!

1209
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:48,689
- What is it, honey?
- Ow!

1210
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:51,926
- Come on, Esther.
Come on. Come.
- Oh. No.

1211
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:55,263
- Come on, come with me.
- I'm fine. I just got excited.

1212
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:56,831
Come on, come on.
Let me take you.

1213
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:59,634
I'll take you upstairs.
Okay, come on.

1214
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,502
- One, two, three.
- ( Esther grunts )

1215
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:04,172
- Here we go.
- Oh...!

1216
01:14:04,174 --> 01:14:07,041
- ( panting )
- Come on.

1217
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,646
Come on.

1218
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,787
I'm okay,
really.

1219
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,126
Len:
<i>Well, whatever it is,</i>
<i>seven or eight days.</i>

1220
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,429
When we're done
with the water--

1221
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:31,799
and there's
tangerine juice, too.

1222
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:35,203
When we're done
with everything,

1223
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:37,972
then we go up.

1224
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,908
<i>Even though the radio</i>
<i>said eight days.</i>

1225
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,877
<i>Maybe we ought to</i>
<i>make it seven.</i>

1226
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:44,812
<i>But what the fuck</i>
<i>do they know, you know?</i>

1227
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,014
<i>Air could be clear</i>
<i>at six.</i>

1228
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,950
Clear enough, anyway,
for me to go up

1229
01:14:48,952 --> 01:14:51,853
and get supplies
and come back down here.

1230
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:05,700
- Len: <i>What?</i>
<i>- The last thing</i>
<i>they said was...</i>

1231
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:09,237
"200 million dead
in Europe."

1232
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,610
So that's not
everybody.

1233
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:18,513
Nothing's
gonna be left, Len.

1234
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,384
<i>We don't know that</i>
<i>until we see.</i>

1235
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:26,921
Len, nothing's left.

1236
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,860
The radio stopped.

1237
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,495
( sighs )

1238
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:37,999
There's no more planes
or helicopters.

1239
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:42,136
When's the last time
you heard anything
other than birds?

1240
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,647
We'll stay down here
three more days.

1241
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:54,949
- And then...
- ( Mia sobs )

1242
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,918
- we'll drive
to the marina.
- No.

1243
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,921
( sighs )
We'll get a boat.

1244
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,125
We'll go out
on the lake.

1245
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:07,128
- ( sighs )
- And we'll keep going
until we find someone.

1246
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,302
- I don't--
- What?

1247
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:16,470
I don't wanna...

1248
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:20,041
wade through
a bunch of corpses

1249
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:22,777
to go steal a boat

1250
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:25,947
to go look at more corpses
lying on a bunch of docks.

1251
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:28,649
( sobs )

1252
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,821
Even--
( sniffles )

1253
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:37,525
even if we did
make it, Len,

1254
01:16:37,527 --> 01:16:40,595
what are we
supposed to do?

1255
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:45,299
Do you really want
to play "Adam and Eve"?

1256
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:48,436
Build it all back up
so it all just gets
destroyed again?

1257
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,605
Maybe people
will learn.

1258
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:53,007
<i>( Mia sniffling )</i>

1259
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:55,977
It's like that guy
who hit you for trying
to take care of his kid.

1260
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:58,846
It's like that guy
I defended-- great guy,

1261
01:16:58,848 --> 01:17:02,683
good father,
always showing me
pictures of his grandson--

1262
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:06,287
who helped invent the shit
that killed everyone.

1263
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:12,393
People aren't
going to learn.

1264
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:14,562
It's something
in us.

1265
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:17,398
It's something
in the way
that we're made.

1266
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:23,270
Then at least...

1267
01:17:23,272 --> 01:17:26,707
we'll have more time.

1268
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,276
At least we'll go out
on the water together.

1269
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,984
We'll find a boat
with a nice, big cabin.

1270
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,125
Come on.

1271
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,432

Len?

1273
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:56,771
That guy, Jay,
from the law firm?

1274
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:10,217
He fell in love
with me.

1275
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,359
I never did
anything.

1276
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:20,861
I never let him
touch me.

1277
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:25,166
( sniffles )
But I...

1278
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,170
you know, I--

1279
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,910
I made him think,
I guess...

1280
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:41,482
that he had
a shot at it.

1281
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,419
- Why?
- It was just a way to--

1282
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,723
Just a way
to pass the time?

1283
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:51,892
--to feel better
about myself, I guess.

1284
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:05,539
Why do you need
to feel better
about yourself?

1285
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:08,409
Mia:
<i>It wasn't about you.</i>

1287
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:29,063
It was
just my curse.

Len.

1289
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:40,641
Why are they
gonna stay down here

1290
01:19:40,643 --> 01:19:42,943
like caged animals?

1291
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:52,920
Or we're gonna go
upstairs tomorrow...

1292
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,829
and lie down
on the grass.

1293
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,800
Breathe in...

1294
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,970
and die...

1295
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,473
when and where
we choose.

1296
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:20,347
We'll eat
the chocolate bar

1297
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:25,486

Oh, yeah, that stuff.

No. I mean,

01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:14,435
Wait a minute.
Listen to this.

"Einstein, 1939.

with any of his friends.

1360
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:11,512
That's just it,
honey.

1361
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:14,782
You don't know it
for sure. You don't--

1362
01:24:14,784 --> 01:24:17,684
( sobbing )

1363
01:24:17,686 --> 01:24:20,854
No! No!

1364
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:25,092
- Oh, oop!
- ( Anna giggling )

1365
01:24:25,094 --> 01:24:29,196
No...
( sobbing )

1366
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,368
( laughing )

1367
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,576
Esther:
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

1368
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,445
Shh...

1369
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,787
( moaning )

1370
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:12,840
<i>( rustling )</i>

1371
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:20,881
<i>( rapid footsteps</i>
<i>pattering )</i>

1372
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:25,686
<i>( siren wails )</i>

1373
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:39,800
Man: Okay, people.
We're closing down
shop in two minutes.

1374
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:42,836
<i>You've got two minutes</i>
<i>to get your purchases</i>
<i>up to the counter.</i>

1375
01:25:42,838 --> 01:25:45,405
<i>Okay?</i>

1376
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:48,609
- That's it, man.
We gotta go.
- Cashier: <i>Come on.</i>

1377
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:51,278
250. Let's go.

1378
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,147
- <i>Come on.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1379
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:55,315
Um... fuck.

1380
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:56,917
Man:
<i>Hey. We're done, man.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

1381
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:59,720
I-I gave
all my money to--
here, just run this.

1382
01:25:59,722 --> 01:26:01,688
Yeah, okay, buddy.
That's it. We're outta here.

1383
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,591
You're closing up shop.
Just-- just--

1384
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:06,727
you're not selling
any more of these
anyway, right?

1385
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:08,495
Don't be stupid, man.
We ain't giving them away,
either.

1386
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:10,597
I understand that.
Just take this. Here.

1387
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:12,366
That's all I got.
It's all I got.

1388
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:14,301
Get the fuck
out of here.

1389
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:16,003
Get the fuck
out now.

1390
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:18,805
<i>( sirens wailing )</i>

1391
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,878
- Hey.
- Hey! Put down the kit!

1392
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,781
It's the end of the world, okay?
Just let me walk out of here
with a chance.

1393
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:29,750
- Put down the kit.
- ( gun hammer clicks )

1394
01:26:29,752 --> 01:26:34,621
What? The last thing
you wanna do on earth
is shoot me?

1395
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,824
This is how this shit
started, anyway.

1396
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,760
Right?
That's how it started
in the first--

1397
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:42,229
<i>( gunshot pops )</i>

1398
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:53,607
- Sachs: You ready?
- I'm fine.

1399
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:56,944
Good. If you're fine,
the tests are gonna show it.

1400
01:26:56,946 --> 01:26:59,646
Anyway--
( groans )

1401
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:03,083
we haven't
seen Dr. Henderson
for a long time.

1402
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:05,018
- Come here.
- That's right.

1403
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,787
And here I was,
trying to cheer you up.

1404
01:27:06,789 --> 01:27:08,922
Oh, yeah.

1405
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:13,560
Sachs:
You remember when
we lived in Washington,

1406
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,796
the Georgetown
apartment?

1407
01:27:15,798 --> 01:27:17,631
Esther:
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

1408
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:19,466
<i>We both got the flu</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

1409
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:23,670
Yeah. And I
took care of you first.

1410
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:25,572
I ran out
in the freezing cold,

1411
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:28,141
went and got you
a nice, big bowl
of hot soup.

1412
01:27:28,143 --> 01:27:30,744
- Esther: <i>It was so cold.</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>Yeah.</i>

1413
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:35,015
And I wrapped you up
all nice and cozy
in a blanket.

1414
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:36,683
Remember?

1415
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:39,853
Then I turned
the thermostat up
as high as it would go.

1416
01:27:39,855 --> 01:27:42,889
Esther:
<i>Then it was my turn</i>
<i>to baby you.</i>

1417
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:45,259
- <i>( Sachs chuckles )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Tucked you in real tight,</i>

1418
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:50,597
<i>And I made you</i>
<i>some of those awful</i>
<i>poached eggs you like.</i>

1419
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,566
Mm-hmm.

1420
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:58,805
It's been
a good life.

1421
01:27:58,807 --> 01:28:01,275
Yeah,
I think so.

1422
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,612
Sachs:
<i>A good life.</i>

1423
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,985
( silent )

1424
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:14,755
Oh, I forgot
to tell you.

1425
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:17,157
What?

1426
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:19,593
The best thing
in the world.

1427
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:22,462
( Anna, Erik
moaning )

1428
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:56,396
( moaning continues )

1429
01:29:16,484 --> 01:29:19,086
I have something
to tell you.

1430
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:24,358
( faintly )
What...?

1431
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,561
The best thing
in the world.

1432
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:35,836
We're going to have
a baby.

1433
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,028
We don't
have to do this.

1434
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:08,235
( sighs )
Whatever we said
last night,

1435
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:10,971
<i>we don't</i>
<i>have to do it.</i>

1436
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:17,043
<i>Not today,</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

1437
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:23,984
Mmm, mmm.

1438
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:26,052
I regret
every fucking diet
I ever went on.

1439
01:30:26,054 --> 01:30:28,188
( chuckles )

1440
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:33,760
Mmm.

1441
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:03,089
Come on.

1442
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:08,094
Let's get out
of here.

1443
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,676
Ahem.

1444
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:26,980
( gasps )

1445
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:29,683
If you have to,

1446
01:31:29,685 --> 01:31:31,551
if that's what
you have to do...

1447
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:34,588
go, but I won't.

1448
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:39,159
I--

1449
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:41,661
I don't think we're
gonna run out of food.

1450
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:43,797
I don't think
we're gonna run
out of water.

1451
01:31:43,799 --> 01:31:46,199
I think that if we
just stay down here
another couple of days--

1452
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:48,401
- No.
- if we go up then,
we're gonna be fine.

1453
01:31:48,403 --> 01:31:50,070
- Mm-mm.
- Okay?

1454
01:31:50,072 --> 01:31:52,472
- No.
- Yeah.

1455
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:54,808
Yes!

1456
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:57,077
( sobs )

1457
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:03,884
Yes.

1458
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:10,557
( sobs )

1459
01:32:10,559 --> 01:32:13,827
Mia!
Don't leave me!

1460
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:20,433
Don't leave me.
Stay with me.

1461
01:32:20,435 --> 01:32:23,370
I love you, baby,
I love you. I need you.

1462
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:26,106
I need you, I need you.
I need you, I need you--
<i>stay!</i>

1463
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:33,113
Please stay!

1464
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:38,818
Please, I need you.
Please?

1465
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,922
( sobbing )

1466
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:09,215
