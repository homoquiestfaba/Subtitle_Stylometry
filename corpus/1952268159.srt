1
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,117
How long will you be?
Oh, I don't know.

2
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:58,359
Uh, not very long.

3
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:13,005
Carol?

4
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,966
Yes. Are you Michael?

5
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,807
Yes.
Nice to meet you.

6
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,328
Am I late?
Not at all.

7
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,848
Brian was right. You are lovely.

8
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:23,570
Thank you.

9
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,211
Uh, our dinner reservations
aren't until 9:00.

10
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:29,092
Would you like a drink?
Sure.

11
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:29,852
You didn't have to drive.

12
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:31,893
I'd have been happy to pick you up.

13
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:34,774
Sometimes I have to work late.

14
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:37,335
Anyway, I prefer to drive myself.

15
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:39,776
In case you need a quick getaway?

16
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:45,939
Blind dates can be a bit grim sometimes.

17
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:48,780
Ever since Brian joined the firm,

18
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,381
He's been trying to marry me off.

19
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:53,941
Are you divorced?

20
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,902
Uh, widower.

21
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:00,024
I'm sorry.
No, that's all right.

22
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:02,385
What kind of work do you do?

23
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:04,386
I work with a publishing company.

24
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:06,146
I'm one of many editors.

25
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:07,827
It's no big deal.

26
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:12,309
I read manuscripts and
take work home at night.

27
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,471
I've known Connie for years.

28
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:16,511
After my divorce,

29
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,472
She took me on as something of a project.

30
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:22,393
She thinks I work too hard.

31
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:23,674
I hope you don't mind my asking,

32
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:29,836
But why did you accept a blind date?

33
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:33,718
I don't know.

34
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:35,678
Connie was seeing Brian,

35
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,919
And the three of us

36
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,160
Had been out to dinner
a couple of times.

37
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,641
He seemed like a nice guy.

38
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,882
Connie said the senior partner
in Brian's law firm

39
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:46,762
Was coming to Los Angeles,

40
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:49,964
And that you were some heavy-duty lawyer

41
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,725
And a really nice guy.

42
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,046
I said I was busy.

43
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:56,807
She said, what did I have to lose?

44
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:00,048
The worst thing that could happen is
I'd have a nice meal.

45
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:02,930
Your friend's right.
Dinner will be good.

46
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:05,170
Mr. Tarlow?
Message for you, sir.

47
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,852
Thank you.
Excuse me.

48
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:13,813
Oh.

49
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,495
I have to go upstairs
and make a phone call.

50
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:20,856
Anything serious?
No. Just an anxious client.

51
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:21,337
Would you like to come up?

52
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,458
I won't be very long.

53
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,738
I know it sounds fishy.

54
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,499
If you prefer to stay down here,

55
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,181
I'll  just be a little while.

56
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:37,543
No. It's all right.
I'll come.

57
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:40,704
Thank you.

58
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:45,467
Wow, this is beautiful.
It is, isn't it?

59
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:51,109
Have a look around.
I'll just be a minute.

60
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:08,876
Yeah, hi, It's Tarlow.
Is he there?

61
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:12,437
Are you sure?
I got a message to call him.

62
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:14,478
Tell him I returned his call, OK?

63
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,639
Thank you.

64
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:26,283
Leo.

65
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:28,723
I just got a message to call you.

66
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:31,445
Hello, Michael.

67
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:33,846
I thought you were in New Orleans.

68
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:35,606
Yeah, but...

69
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,528
I decided to come home a day early.

70
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:41,049
I wish you would have let me know.

71
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,049
I'd have called you.

72
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,171
There's no need for that now, is there?

73
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,132
You going to invite us in?

74
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:55,295
Uh, yeah. Sure. Excuse me.

75
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:00,976
Wootton, this is Michael Tarlow,

76
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:04,418
My lawyer.
Michael, Jack Wootton.

77
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:06,939
How do you do?

78
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,500
Sit down.
Can I get you something to drink?

79
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,821
No, thank you.

80
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:14,622
I take it you've been busy.
Yeah.

81
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:16,263
What brings you to Los Angeles?

82
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,863
I'm closing the gallway deal.

83
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,904
I should have papers on your desk soon.

84
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:24,666
You didn't have to come here.
You could have called.

85
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:26,867
When you do things face to face,

86
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,988
It's a lot clearer.

87
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:32,189
I agree.

88
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,190
You seem edgy, Michael.

89
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,833
That's not like you.
I'm fine.

90
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,795
What can I do for you?

91
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:49,797
I have a problem.
I need your advice.

92
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:52,557
that's what you pay me for.
that's right.

93
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:55,238
That's what I pay you for.

94
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:57,919
There's a man who works for me.

95
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,880
He's close to me. I trusted him.

96
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,121
So what's the problem?

97
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:05,443
He got himself into some
financial trouble.

98
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:08,684
He made some investments.

99
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,565
He leveraged himself up to his eyeballs.

100
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:13,766
The investments didn't work out.

101
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:15,727
He got himself in serious debt.

102
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:19,168
He didn't come to me and
tell me his problem.

103
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,409
He didn't come to the man
who trusted him

104
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:23,730
And ask for help.

105
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,171
What he did was, he just took my money,

106
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:28,732
Took a lot of it.

107
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:32,533
He was very clever,
so it was very hard to find out about.

108
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:35,094
I need your advice, Michael.

109
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:39,576
What should I do with this man?

110
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:40,817
Leo...

111
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:42,858
What do you think?

112
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:46,299
What would you do?
Now, you don't understand, Leo.

113
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:48,860
I understand.
I can explain it.

114
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,542
Good.
I would like you to.

115
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:56,263
It's not what you think. I would never-

116
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,944
Please, Michael.

117
00:08:58,143 --> 00:09:04,106
Have enough respect for me not to lie.

118
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:08,788
I...

119
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,949
I was desperate, Leo.

120
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:16,391
I took some funds from
the con-amalgate account...

121
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:19,832
To cover a loan. I--

122
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:23,273
I was going to pay you back.
I swear!

123
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:26,915
I'm so disappointed in you, Michael.

124
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:31,437
For god's sake, you got to believe me.
You know I'd pay you back.

125
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:33,557
Michael, don't be afraid.

126
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:35,959
You're acting like you think
I'll harm you.

127
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,799
Michael...

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,601
Even though we were close,

129
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,442
Even though you betrayed me,

130
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:44,162
And I trusted you,

131
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:47,283
I would never harm you.

132
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:50,044
Here's what You're going to do.

133
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:53,166
You're going to go back to New York.

134
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:56,087
Someone else will close
the gallway deal.

135
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,688
I will never do business with you again.

136
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:02,529
You'll pay me back what
you owe with interest.

137
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,170
If you have to sell your nice apartment

138
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,771
With the David Hockneys,

139
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:08,252
Then You'll do that.

140
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:10,492
You will pay me back.

141
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,493
I will never speak to you again.

142
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,374
You're right, Michael.

143
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:16,896
It's better to talk these things
over face to face.

144
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:21,057
It's clearer that way.

145
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:27,300
Good bye, Michael.
don't get up.

146
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,740
Oh, Michael?

147
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,942
I lied.

148
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,121
Yeah?

149
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:06,403
Caulfield here.

150
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:08,924
What?

151
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:11,325
How soon can you be here?

152
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:13,766
Five minutes is too long.

153
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:16,967
Right.

154
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,053
He's in a conference.

155
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:33,214
Right.

156
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,855
Good morning.
Won't you come in?

157
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:38,416
Martin, James,

158
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,577
Detective sergeant Benti.

159
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,857
Nice meeting you.
This is James Dahlbeck.

160
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:43,778
Like Caulfield, He's a deputy D. A.

161
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:46,059
We were discussing his trial tomorrow.

162
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,901
that's why my door was closed.

163
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,462
I believe It's called a conference.

164
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:53,983
Remember those latents we found

165
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:56,343
On the bathroom glass in Tarlow's suite?

166
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,264
Yes. They never checked out.

167
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,265
Not in California.

168
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,466
But detective sergeant Benti's been hard at work.

169
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:04,826
I'm impressed.

170
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,468
Go ahead, detective sergeant.

171
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:10,629
Make me look good.

172
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:13,150
We ran those prints
through the federal computer.

173
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,270
They belong to carol Hunnicut,

174
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,392
Arrested for disorderly conduct in 1981,

175
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:19,152
Some kind of antinuke bullshit.

176
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:21,393
She works for a publishing company.

177
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:24,594
She's been absent since Tarlow died.

178
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:27,596
This is riveting.
He'll get your attention.

179
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:29,116
I checked through our logs.

180
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:31,958
Two days after Tarlow died, we got a call.

181
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:36,599
Constance billings said her friend
was Missing.

182
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,200
We told her to file
a Missing persons report.

183
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:42,841
She changed her mind,
said maybe her friend left for a while.

184
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,963
She never gave us the friend's full name,

185
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:47,084
Just carol.

186
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:49,484
Still with us?
I'm holding my own.

187
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:53,326
I got Constance's address
and went to see her

188
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,367
Early this morning.
Before they've had their coffee,

189
00:14:56,567 --> 00:15:00,529
They rattle easier.

190
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,770
She didn't want to see me from nothing.

191
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,651
She said she didn't know anything.

192
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:06,331
She had total amnesia.

193
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,493
She was scared shitless.

194
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:10,653
I said we'd protect her and her friend.

195
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:12,213
We couldn't if she didn't help.

196
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:15,175
She cracked like a raw egg.

197
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,336
Then she comes out with it.

198
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:18,256
The reason why

199
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,978
Hunnicut's fingerprints
were on the glass

200
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:24,899
Is because she was there
when Tarlow got hit.

201
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:29,100
She saw it.
She was there.

202
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:33,262
It gets better.

203
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:38,304
It gets a lot better.

204
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,505
Guess who Was there with the button man?

205
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,226
You're kidding?
Leo fucking Watts.

206
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:45,387
In person.
In living color.

207
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,947
The woman Was in the other room.

208
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:49,148
She saw everything.
Everything.

209
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:51,430
Nobody knew about her.
Where is she?

210
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,670
She understand ably freaked and took off.

211
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,311
She called her friend,
told her what happened,

212
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:57,952
And that she was still alive.

213
00:15:58,152 --> 00:16:02,234
She's hiding in a cabin in east Jesus.

214
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:04,555
There is a god.
Unbelievable.

215
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:07,076
I've chartered a plane.
It'll fly to a small strip.

216
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,677
A helicopter will fly us where she is.

217
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:12,398
I'll pick her up.

218
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,238
Nobody knows anything about her.

219
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,960
Leo's in for a surprise.
Meantime, get your warrant.

220
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,041
What if she won't talk?
She'll talk.

221
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:23,722
You know this for a fact?
I'll promise her protection.

222
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,443
I'll offer her relocation.

223
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:26,603
She has to talk.

224
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:29,645
Shouldn't you find out
if she'll cooperate?

225
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:32,126
There's no phone.
She might just take off.

226
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,247
Where is this place?
In Canada.

227
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,087
I can't authorize this

228
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,809
Without checking with the director
of branch and area operations.

229
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,169
I have to follow procedure.

230
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,650
This is Leo Watts.

231
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,491
We've got him for murder one.

232
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,172
You understand what that means?

233
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:49,652
I do. I still have to check.

234
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:52,014
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

235
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:53,654
Why are you doing this again?

236
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:56,655
Doing what?
Last year we had him.

237
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,817
You put me in your bureaucratic blender,

238
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:03,098
And we lost him.
You had uncorroborated statements

239
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:04,579
From an informant doing hard time

240
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:07,260
Who'd sell his own mother.

241
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,260
In fact, he did try that,

242
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,302
Except his mother had been dead
for 10 years.

243
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:16,023
You want to make the announcement?

244
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:19,024
Television cameras are an aphrodisiac to you.

245
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,026
You could be on the news.

246
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:25,187
Does that satisfy you?

247
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:28,028
Our job is to convict criminals,

248
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:30,429
Not to have them acquitted.

249
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:32,390
I'll conduct business in a proper way,

250
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,031
Whether it pleases you or not.

251
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:40,233
I don't like the implications
of what You're saying.

252
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:43,395
Let's go.

253
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:47,556
We're going.

254
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:48,877
We're going now.

255
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:55,039
Not without my authorization.

256
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:10,245
Why does he have to fly so low?

257
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:14,247
We're not low.
The ground's high.

258
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,688
See?
Now we're high.

259
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,209
I hate these things.

260
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:21,890
Sorry, sir.
A little turbulence in the thermals

261
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:23,930
On the mountain's windward side.

262
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,172
I don't want to know about thermals.

263
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,413
You have to admit,
the scenery's spectacular.

264
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,654
If I want scenery, I'll  get a postcard.

265
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:35,775
How much longer?
We'll be there in five minutes.

266
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:39,257
that's too long.
What does she look like?

267
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:43,938
I don't care.
I don't like the company she keeps.

268
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:45,980
You realize when we go down,

269
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:50,141
Nobody will find us except
some fucking moose.

270
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:54,222
You think top gun up there can tell
If somebody's following us?

271
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:58,384
Like what, a condor?

272
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:02,506
There it is.

273
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:25,115
Keep the motor running, OK?

274
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:34,759
It's warm.

275
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:47,044
Miss Hunnicut?

276
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:49,244
I'm detective sergeant Dominick Benti,

277
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:51,846
Los Angeles police department.

278
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:58,128
With me is deputy district
attorney Robert Caulfield.

279
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:00,169
We know You're in there.

280
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,730
We'll wait all day if we have to.

281
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,771
Real cold out here.

282
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,933
Hope we don't have to.

283
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:17,816
Can I see some identification, please?

284
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,581
What do you want?

285
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,061
I think you know.

286
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,182
I don't know what You're talking about.

287
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:38,384
You were witness to a murder.
We'd like you to testify.

288
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,586
I never saw anything.

289
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,386
How did you find me?

290
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,628
Constance billings told us.

291
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,268
She said you saw a lot.

292
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:49,789
I have nothing to say.

293
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:52,910
You wouldn't happen to have a drink,
would you?

294
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,391
You' re on duty.

295
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:57,272
I only drink when I'm on duty.

296
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:58,513
How do I know who you are?

297
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:00,553
You saw our i. d.

298
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:03,634
It could be fake. I wouldn't know.

299
00:21:03,835 --> 00:21:05,195
If we were going to do you some harm,

300
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:11,358
We'd have done it already.

301
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,359
There's coffee on the stove.

302
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,040
Do you have any beer?
No.

303
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,561
Nice place.

304
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:24,163
Thanks.
Jesus! She really doesn't have beer.

305
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:27,644
We'd really like you to come back
and testify.

306
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:29,164
I'm not going anywhere with you.

307
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,406
I didn't see anything.
I don't know anything.

308
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:33,966
I'm not testifying.

309
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,968
aren't you pleasant.

310
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,449
I really have nothing to say to you.

311
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,850
Please leave.
You don't realize your situation.

312
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,291
I know exactly the situation I'm in.

313
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:47,492
I don't think you do.
We can protect you.

314
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:48,813
They'll find you here.

315
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:51,653
There's no reason for anyone
to come after me.

316
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:54,335
I'm not testifying.

317
00:21:54,535 --> 00:22:00,017
I have a subpoena.
Let me see it.

318
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:01,657
I can get one.

319
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:03,218
I think you should leave.

320
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,419
Lady, You're kidding yourself.

321
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,180
You think those guys would come here,

322
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,702
You, who could put Leo Watts
in the gas chamber,

323
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:13,023
And you tell them You're not testifying,

324
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:16,304
And they' d say, that's a relief.
Thanks.

325
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:20,905
Have a nice day.
Then they'd turn around and go home?

326
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,146
They'd never find me.

327
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:26,828
We did.
I'll take my chances.

328
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:37,792
Do you have the keys to that car?

329
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:40,994
On the table.

330
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:46,316
I don't suppose There's a back door,
is there?

331
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:49,517
No.
How about a window?

332
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:55,680
Yes. It's in the bathroom.

333
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:24,531
You get to that window, all right?

334
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:27,092
Keep low. Wait for me there.

335
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:30,294
Go! Go!

336
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:21,194
Now!

337
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:47,484
What have you done to me?

338
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:49,045
Nobody knew where I was.

339
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:52,487
Sorry. I didn't know
they were following us.

340
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,327
aren't you supposed to?

341
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:55,447
isn't that your job?

342
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:57,608
How could you let somebody follow you?

343
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:00,209
Where's the closest telephone?

344
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,372
8 miles down this road.

345
00:26:58,657 --> 00:27:00,817
The trains slowing down.
How far to the station?

346
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:04,979
About a half mile.

347
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:22,170
Let's go.

348
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:53,582
Excuse me.

349
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:55,744
Where's the closest big town?

350
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,185
I beg your pardon.
A big city with an airport.

351
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:00,345
Where's the nearest one?

352
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:02,506
East, about 1 00 miles.

353
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:06,668
Which way is this train heading?
West, of course.

354
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,749
Vancouver's as big as you get.

355
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:10,629
This train goes to Vancouver.

356
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,191
How long does that take?
You arrive Vancouver 1 0: 40 a. m.

357
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:15,392
You're kidding?

358
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,713
No, You're not kidding.

359
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:19,914
I'd like a private compartment.

360
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:23,515
Sorry. All we got left is coach seats.

361
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:25,195
I have to have a private compartment.

362
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,676
Then wait until tomorrow.

363
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:30,438
I'll see if we got space on that train.

364
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:36,440
I have to be on that train.

365
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,921
I'd like to help you out.
There's nothing I can do.

366
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:40,602
I have to lie down.

367
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:41,442
She has to lie down.

368
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:46,003
If I go into labor, I have to lie down.

369
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:48,245
The baby' s not due
for another two weeks--

370
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:52,527
I have to lie down.
It's OK.

371
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,327
I couldn't help overhearing.

372
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,768
My wife and i, we have a compartment.

373
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:58,969
You kids need it more than we do.

374
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:01,570
We couldn't do that.
Please. I insist.

375
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:04,612
I remember how it was with our mark.

376
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:08,333
Is this your first?
Yes. that's very kind. Thank you.

377
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:11,854
I'll pay for both tickets.
I insist.

378
00:30:12,055 --> 00:30:14,496
Is there a phone on the train?
Afraid not.

379
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:17,696
$ 1 95, please.

380
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:22,418
that's car 564, drawing room A.

381
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:30,102
It's toward the end of the train.
Thank you.

382
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:31,782
Get on the train.

383
00:30:31,982 --> 00:30:34,623
don't wait for me.
Get in the room, lock the door.

384
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:37,385
don't let anybody in.

385
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:41,266
They probably haven't seen you.
All right. Here.

386
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,467
Go. Go.

387
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:51,870
I'm really very grateful.
that's quite all right.

388
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:58,033
Take care of the little lady.

389
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:17,969
Yes?

390
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:21,090
There's been some mistake.
This is my compartment.

391
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,851
If There's a mistake, It's yours.

392
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:24,652
This is our compartment.
You're sure?

393
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:27,612
Yes, of course I'm sure.
Could you please excuse us?

394
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:30,374
The conductor said this was mine.

395
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:34,055
He couldn't have said that.
This is our compartment.

396
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:37,777
Could I see your ticket, please?
Can I see yours?

397
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,258
My wife has our tickets.

398
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:42,339
Well, maybe your wife is
in the proper car.

399
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:45,220
This is my son. This is not your wife.

400
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
This is our compartment.

401
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:49,142
I would like you to leave.

402
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,222
This guy's lying.

403
00:33:51,422 --> 00:33:53,743
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, really.

404
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,785
I'm always getting myself
into these kinds of things.

405
00:33:56,984 --> 00:34:00,626
One time, I, uh, I lost my car.

406
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:02,746
I parked it in a parking lot

407
00:34:02,947 --> 00:34:06,988
And forgot where I parked it.
I just--

408
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:08,309
You know what that's like.

409
00:34:08,509 --> 00:34:10,830
No, I don't. Would you please get out?

410
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:16,993
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

411
00:34:22,114 --> 00:34:23,436
Is this car 564?

412
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:25,476
No.

413
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:27,917
Well, there you are.
See? I've done it again.

414
00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:30,078
I'm supposed to be in car 564.

415
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:32,959
Maybe you should go to car 564.

416
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,599
Would you know where that is?

417
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,080
No, I wouldn't.

418
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,082
He's lying, mom. He's a train robber.

419
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:41,803
Why would I want a train?

420
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:43,204
Do you have a gun?

421
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:45,684
I guess I'll see the conductor.

422
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,845
He'd know where car 564 is,
wouldn't you think?

423
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,846
I'd expect so. Try doing that.

424
00:34:51,046 --> 00:34:53,007
I'll do that.
I'll go find him

425
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:56,408
And ask him where car 564 really is.

426
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:01,090
Good idea.
Well, uh, sorry for the inconvenience.

427
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:14,296
You folks have a nice trip.
You, too.

428
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:21,778
It's me, Caulfield.

429
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:23,899
How you doing?
I've been better.

430
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,300
Yeah, me, too.

431
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,541
So, are we expecting company?

432
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:29,382
There's two of them.

433
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:36,104
It won't take them long
to find this compartment.

434
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:38,145
I'm getting off at the next stop.

435
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,625
that's impossible.

436
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:43,187
You watch me.
We'd be sitting ducks out there.

437
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:45,308
Who said anything about we?

438
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:49,310
You're going out there alone?

439
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:52,391
We're in the middle of
a goddamn wilderness.

440
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:54,471
Look out the window, for Christ's sakes.

441
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:57,473
You're going out there on foot?
A breeze.

442
00:35:57,713 --> 00:35:59,474
I can protect you better here.

443
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:04,156
Protect me?
You're the one who put me in danger.

444
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:09,958
I'm not stupid, Mr. Caulfield.

445
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:14,479
I won't survive stuck on this train
until tomorrow.

446
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,721
Let me tell you something.
A police officer died

447
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:21,522
Trying to help get you back
to Los Angeles.

448
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:24,604
I'm going to get you back there.

449
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:27,405
I can't tell you what a comfort that is.

450
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:30,486
I don't think I like you.
The weekend in Paris is off?.

451
00:36:30,686 --> 00:36:34,488
You got a big mouth.
Use it on the witness stand.

452
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,489
I don't think you hear very well.

453
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:38,929
I'm not testifying at this trial.

454
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:40,410
You still don't get it.

455
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,731
These guys are grownups
with automatic weapons.

456
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:45,892
If they see you, they'll kill you.

457
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:47,573
We got two things going for us--

458
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:50,694
One, they've seen me, but maybe not you.

459
00:36:50,894 --> 00:36:54,255
They might not recognize you.

460
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:57,016
And... we got one thing going for us.

461
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:02,619
But I've got you to protect me.

462
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:05,820
Who is it?
The conductor, sir.

463
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:07,300
Uh, yes?

464
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,342
I'm sorry to disturb you.

465
00:37:09,582 --> 00:37:12,983
A gentleman has lost his briefcase.

466
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:16,185
Yeah.

467
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:23,708
Well, we think the porter
may have left it

468
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,909
In one of these compartments by mistake.

469
00:37:26,148 --> 00:37:27,549
We're checking the whole car.

470
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,790
It's not in here.

471
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,111
You're welcome to take a look
if you'd like.

472
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,272
Thank you.

473
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:41,035
Hmm. I guess It's not in here.

474
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:42,555
I guess not.

475
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:45,356
I'm sure It's in this car someplace.

476
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,558
Maybe not.

477
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:51,159
We'll keep looking.

478
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:57,321
I'm sorry to have bothered you, sir.

479
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:04,564
He'll be back, won't he?
Yeah.

480
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:07,805
How do we stop him?
We don't.

481
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:10,407
Want me to set out some hors doeuvres?

482
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:17,089
I want you to do exactly
what I tell you to do.

483
00:40:02,331 --> 00:40:04,212
Excuse me.
I wasn't looking where I was going.

484
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:06,813
that's quite all right, sir.

485
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:09,054
Operator, I want to make a collect call
to James Dahlbeck.

486
00:40:09,294 --> 00:40:15,257
My name is Caulfield. C-a-u-l-f-i-e-l-d.

487
00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:30,982
Caulfield, where the hell are you?

488
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:33,224
I'm on a train.
You're on a what?

489
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:37,585
We were followed. Sergeant Benti's dead.

490
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:40,146
It seems strange.
Larner doesn't want to send me here,

491
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:42,187
Then we're followed.

492
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:44,228
You're way off base.
Think so?

493
00:40:44,428 --> 00:40:46,869
Two times in one year
he tries to stop me.

494
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,390
that's stretching coincidence, isn't it?

495
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,710
What can I say?

496
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:52,712
don't say anything. Just listen.

497
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,592
At least two guys are following us.

498
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:57,593
One has an automatic weapon.
Maybe they both do.

499
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,555
The helicopter was destroyed,
the pilot is dead.

500
00:41:00,754 --> 00:41:02,395
The Perps are on the train.

501
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:05,316
They don't know what the girl looks like.

502
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:11,479
They sure as hell know what I look like.

503
00:41:19,162 --> 00:41:20,322
Where the hell's this train?

504
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,243
We're heading west towards Vancouver.

505
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:24,084
We'll be there at 1 0:00 a.m.

506
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:26,485
We can't hold out. They'll find her.

507
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:27,925
Where's the next stop?

508
00:41:28,126 --> 00:41:31,326
Uh, a town called Monashee.

509
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:34,168
We'll be in there about midnight.

510
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:36,329
Do what you can to keep the girl
hidden until then.

511
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:39,330
I'll have you met at the next station.

512
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,251
don't say anything to Larner about this.

513
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:45,293
I won't. Hey, uh... You hang in there.

514
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:48,414
Yeah, sure.

515
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,652
He's gone.

516
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,134
We're changing cars.

517
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:34,296
This one is getting too popular.

518
00:43:35,536 --> 00:43:37,297
We get into the next station
around midnight.

519
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:43,420
There'll be some people there to meet us.

520
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,540
Then we can get off this damn train.

521
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,701
Thank god.

522
00:43:54,744 --> 00:43:55,905
These guys can't just go blasting

523
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:59,346
Everybody in sight.
They' re professionals.

524
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:01,507
They start a war on a train
in the boondocks,

525
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:06,949
They got a good chance of being caught.

526
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:09,390
They have to find you, do it cleanly,

527
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,232
Without drawing attention to themselves.

528
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:18,234
If they don't know where you are,
You're OK.

529
00:44:18,433 --> 00:44:20,794
It's going to be OK, really.

530
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:22,956
I'm telling you,
It's going to be all right.

531
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:25,117
I'm not going to Los Angeles with you.

532
00:44:25,357 --> 00:44:27,557
I'm telling you right now, I'm not going.

533
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:29,878
You hungry?
Oh, I don't know.

534
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,759
I'll  get you something.
I'm not hungry.

535
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,801
Lock this door.
don't let the porter or the conductor--

536
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,641
I said I'm not hungry.

537
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,523
You need something to eat.
OK, you stay, and I'll go.

538
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:42,643
What?

539
00:44:42,844 --> 00:44:44,804
Every time you leave

540
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:48,085
And every time you come back,
you put me in danger.

541
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:49,806
They know what you look like.

542
00:44:50,006 --> 00:44:53,047
They don't know me. I'll go myself.

543
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:55,729
Suppose they do know what you look like?

544
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:59,690
Maybe they've seen you.
Maybe your photograph was faxed

545
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:01,931
When they checked you out.
W ant to risk that?

546
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:05,012
You don't want to bring me food.

547
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:10,174
Lock the door behind me.

548
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,989
May I get you something to drink, sir?
Yeah, a beer, please.

549
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,110
What kind?
Oh, I don't know. You choose.

550
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,352
Yes, sir.

551
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:57,793
Oh!
I'm terribly sorry!

552
00:45:57,994 --> 00:46:00,435
It's all right. It's OK.
Does it hurt?

553
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:03,996
It's just my foot.
I'll grow another in a week.

554
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:06,237
I'm so clumsy. I'm sorry.

555
00:46:06,437 --> 00:46:08,238
It's not you, It's the train.

556
00:46:08,438 --> 00:46:08,998
It's very bumpy, that's all.

557
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:12,639
No, It's me.
I'm always doing things like that.

558
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,001
Oh, I'm sorry again.

559
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,002
It's OK. It's OK. It's the same foot.

560
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:19,683
Gee!

561
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:21,644
Can I buy you something to drink?

562
00:46:21,883 --> 00:46:24,084
No, that's not necessary.
I'd like to.

563
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:28,326
I'm fine, really.
I insist. I am clumsy, but I have money.

564
00:46:28,526 --> 00:46:31,207
I'm not that liberated yet.

565
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:34,768
I'll  have the same, please,
and this is for both of them.

566
00:46:34,968 --> 00:46:39,410
Here, let me--
No, no, It's done. Was it so difficult?

567
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,172
I feel like Phil Donahue.

568
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:45,853
My name, Skathryn Weller.

569
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,534
I'm Robert Caulfield.
How are you?

570
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:50,695
Good.

571
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:55,857
You don't look like somebody
who takes the train.

572
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:58,498
What does somebody who takes
the train look like?

573
00:46:58,698 --> 00:47:00,139
Patient.

574
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:04,181
Yeah, It's the first time I've done this.

575
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,382
No, that's fine.
Thank you, ma'am.

576
00:47:06,581 --> 00:47:08,542
How about you? Do you do this often?

577
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:12,063
No, not often. I, uh...

578
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:14,424
I was trying to water-ski on lake Louise.

579
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,025
I wasn't good at it. I tend to fall down.

580
00:47:17,265 --> 00:47:20,227
I noticed.

581
00:47:21,066 --> 00:47:23,228
I'm also terrified of flying, so...

582
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:27,029
Really? I don't mind that at all.

583
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,710
I'm in no rush.

584
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,751
The one thing I have is time.

585
00:47:32,952 --> 00:47:35,553
You also said you had money.

586
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:41,756
Oh, i, uh... i had a good divorce lawyer.

587
00:47:43,435 --> 00:47:44,797
Am I interrupting you?

588
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:48,838
No, I'm sorry, really. I, uh...

589
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,120
Well, Here's to, uh...
Community property.

590
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:58,842
Come to think of it, I earned it.

591
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,804
Are you--
Are you traveling alone?

592
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:05,485
Yes.
Oh.

593
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:07,566
How long were you married?

594
00:48:07,766 --> 00:48:10,407
Six years.
Mm-hmm.

595
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:12,768
One day over bran muffins--
He loved bran muffins--

596
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:17,130
He said he had to find himself,
just like that.

597
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:19,410
I'm standing there with
a pot of brewed decaf--

598
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,852
He only drank brewed decaf--

599
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:23,932
And he said he had to find himself.

600
00:48:24,132 --> 00:48:25,893
I asked if he wanted
to finish breakfast first.

601
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:27,694
Ha ha!
Before I knew it,

602
00:48:27,893 --> 00:48:31,135
He'd taken his air popcorn maker--
No cholesterol, you see--

603
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:34,177
And his lifecycle and moved
into this nice duplex

604
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,458
With a 23-year-old waitress
from one of his restaurants.

605
00:48:37,657 --> 00:48:41,219
Not bad for somebody who's lost.

606
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,740
He won't run out of waitresses.

607
00:48:43,941 --> 00:48:46,221
You'll have to excuse me.

608
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:47,822
I'm sorry, I've been talking too much.

609
00:48:48,022 --> 00:48:50,262
I tend to do it--
No, It's not you.

610
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:52,103
I understand.

611
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,424
I wish I could explain, but--

612
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:59,106
By the way,
I think your restaurant guy is nuts.

613
00:49:37,562 --> 00:49:39,243
I don't think this will work.

614
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:41,844
I'll back up. It's shorter this way.

615
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:44,045
I appreciate that.
These things weren't designed

616
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:48,206
For people my size.

617
00:49:48,646 --> 00:49:54,609
No one loves a fat man but his grocer.

618
00:50:07,294 --> 00:50:09,535
Did you find your briefcase yet, sir?

619
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:11,736
No, not yet.

620
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:14,457
aren't your seats
at the head of the train?

621
00:50:14,617 --> 00:50:17,618
that's right. I get mixed up.

622
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:19,259
Well, it can be confusing, sir.

623
00:50:19,498 --> 00:50:22,420
Thank you.

624
00:50:34,225 --> 00:50:36,986
What the--

625
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:40,147
Shh! Shh!

626
00:50:41,948 --> 00:50:47,910
Please. I'm not going to hurt you.

627
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:54,553
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

628
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,763
You're supposed to say something.

629
00:51:19,962 --> 00:51:22,163
Like what?

630
00:51:22,364 --> 00:51:24,284
Something reassuring.

631
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:27,846
It's going to work out.

632
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:32,368
Thanks. That made a world of difference.

633
00:51:32,568 --> 00:51:34,008
We'll be in the station soon.

634
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:38,690
You'll be safe when we get there.

635
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,731
I hope they've gotten
to your cabin by now

636
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,332
And taken care of Benti.

637
00:51:43,572 --> 00:51:45,973
He shouldn't be left alone like that.

638
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:47,974
I'm sorry about your friend.

639
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:52,136
He wasn't my friend.

640
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:56,938
I just met him.

641
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:00,219
The jerk.

642
00:52:00,419 --> 00:52:03,740
Two years away from retirement.

643
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,541
I'm sorry.

644
00:52:05,701 --> 00:52:07,422
Are you?

645
00:52:07,622 --> 00:52:09,343
There are two guys on this train.

646
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:12,304
One killed a police officer and a pilot.

647
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:13,824
I couldn't see in the helicopter.

648
00:52:14,024 --> 00:52:15,264
I couldn't identify them,

649
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,827
You couldn't identify them,

650
00:52:19,026 --> 00:52:20,507
Except...

651
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:22,748
They' re the guys.

652
00:52:22,988 --> 00:52:24,949
They work for Leo Watts.

653
00:52:25,148 --> 00:52:27,510
There's nothing I can do.

654
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,511
All I can charge him with
is riding on a train.

655
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:33,592
They're going to walk.

656
00:52:34,273 --> 00:52:37,233
There'll be a funeral for Benti.

657
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:38,874
Flag-draped coffin,

658
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:40,275
Everybody in dress blues,

659
00:52:40,555 --> 00:52:43,196
His picture on the precinct wall,

660
00:52:43,396 --> 00:52:45,877
People saying how terrible it was.

661
00:52:46,118 --> 00:52:47,598
Another funeral for the pilot,

662
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,158
Not as spiffy as Benti's.

663
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,039
No flags, nothing like that.

664
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,201
There'll be two wives serving
a lot of food,

665
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:59,042
Two groups of children trying
to be very brave.

666
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,643
Those two guys died

667
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:03,364
Trying to help get you back
to Los Angeles,

668
00:53:03,604 --> 00:53:05,205
And the two guys who killed them

669
00:53:05,405 --> 00:53:08,286
Are going to walk,

670
00:53:08,487 --> 00:53:15,969
Unless you testify against the man
who sent them up here.

671
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:24,972
Two years from retirement.

672
00:53:27,094 --> 00:53:30,055
What a jerk.

673
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:49,302
Keep the lights out.

674
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:04,429
Jesus, they didn't exactly
bring out the national guard.

675
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:08,110
I guess they didn't want to
attract too much attention.

676
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,832
You stay here, OK?

677
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:15,273
don't do anything,
but just stay out of sight.

678
00:54:15,473 --> 00:54:18,715
When we're ready,
when I think It's secure,

679
00:54:18,914 --> 00:54:20,555
I'll come and get you.

680
00:54:20,755 --> 00:54:22,276
Oh, and, uh...

681
00:54:22,476 --> 00:54:26,918
I know, I know, lock it.

682
00:54:44,405 --> 00:54:46,005
You Caulfield?
Yeah.

683
00:54:46,205 --> 00:54:47,967
I'm sergeant Nigro, rcmp.

684
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:52,168
This is detective Loughlin.

685
00:54:52,368 --> 00:54:53,569
They sent two of you, huh?

686
00:54:53,768 --> 00:54:55,449
It's a pretty remote area.

687
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,771
Backup's on the way.
So, you guys are mounties?

688
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,972
Yes, uh, we don't really
use horses anymore.

689
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:03,613
that's mostly for the tourists.

690
00:55:03,772 --> 00:55:08,214
Besides, horses don't
have air conditioning.

691
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:11,615
I don't think we should
stand around out here

692
00:55:11,816 --> 00:55:13,096
Any longer than is necessary.

693
00:55:13,296 --> 00:55:14,417
Where's the woman?

694
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:18,858
She's on the train. I've got her hidden.

695
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:20,459
A couple guys on the train
have been following us.

696
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:21,739
They're armed.

697
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,261
I think I've got them on a possible 314.

698
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:26,782
Let's get the woman into safe custody.

699
00:55:26,982 --> 00:55:28,902
Your 3 1 4s can't get anywhere.

700
00:55:29,103 --> 00:55:31,783
We'll send units to meet
the train at the next stop.

701
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:33,424
We'll nail them.

702
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,025
I think You're right.

703
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:37,306
Why don't you get the woman

704
00:55:37,506 --> 00:55:38,587
And we can get out of here?

705
00:55:38,747 --> 00:55:43,228
Right. I know You'll think
this is dumb of me,

706
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:46,790
But I haven't been feeling good lately.

707
00:55:46,989 --> 00:55:48,390
My stomach, you know.

708
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:50,672
So I got to run over to the toilet

709
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:53,632
For a second.
Are you serious?

710
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:56,034
I don't have any choice.
You know what It's like.

711
00:55:56,233 --> 00:56:00,715
I'll  be right back.

712
00:57:16,106 --> 00:57:20,587
Mr. Caulfield, you all right?

713
00:57:20,907 --> 00:57:23,909
Caulfield?

714
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:51,760
Shithead.

715
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,641
A 3 1 4 is indecent exposure.
You're no cop.

716
00:57:54,841 --> 00:57:59,283
Who sent you?
Fuck you.

717
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:25,613
You're a dead man, do you know that?

718
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:49,759
You all right, sir?
Yeah. That was close.

719
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,960
I was taking a walk.
I didn't realize the train was leaving.

720
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,682
You could have been hurt.

721
01:02:54,881 --> 01:02:56,842
That was stupid of me.

722
01:02:57,042 --> 01:02:58,002
I'll never do that again.

723
01:02:58,203 --> 01:03:00,644
I certainly hope not.

724
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:03,605
Listen...

725
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:08,286
Never mind.

726
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,988
Mr. Caulfield,
I have a business proposition

727
01:04:02,189 --> 01:04:03,549
That might interest you.

728
01:04:03,749 --> 01:04:06,510
Would you care for a drink?
What will you have? It's my treat.

729
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:10,311
Coffee, please.
Seven and seven for me,

730
01:04:10,512 --> 01:04:12,833
And scotch for my associate.

731
01:04:12,993 --> 01:04:15,194
I figured him for something
with an umbrella in it.

732
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,195
He won't lose his composure.

733
01:04:18,395 --> 01:04:19,515
He's very good at what he does.

734
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:20,836
So am i.

735
01:04:21,036 --> 01:04:24,397
But I do it for a living. He enjoys it.

736
01:04:24,637 --> 01:04:26,358
People should have fun at work.

737
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:29,079
It makes the day go by quicker.

738
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:33,801
As I said,
I have a business proposition for you.

739
01:04:34,722 --> 01:04:36,802
Tell me,

740
01:04:36,962 --> 01:04:39,043
How much does a deputy district attorney

741
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:40,884
Make in a year?

742
01:04:41,124 --> 01:04:43,485
Enough. Oh, I doubt that.

743
01:04:43,685 --> 01:04:45,045
Are you thinking of becoming a lawyer?

744
01:04:45,246 --> 01:04:48,247
I was thinking we might
negotiate an arrangement

745
01:04:48,446 --> 01:04:50,888
That would be mutually satisfactory.

746
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:53,569
He says he thinks we can make a deal.

747
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:56,410
Ha ha ha.

748
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,011
Does he speak?

749
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:01,172
Yeah. Sometimes very convincingly.

750
01:05:01,412 --> 01:05:05,014
I'm going to enjoy this.

751
01:05:05,254 --> 01:05:09,696
Thank you. Keep the change.
Thank you, sir.

752
01:05:10,736 --> 01:05:12,857
The people I work for
are very determined.

753
01:05:12,977 --> 01:05:15,338
They want the woman.

754
01:05:15,538 --> 01:05:16,699
You have her,

755
01:05:16,938 --> 01:05:18,859
And the question is simply,

756
01:05:18,979 --> 01:05:21,060
How much do you want?

757
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,622
What woman?

758
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:25,822
Well, you know we're going to find her.

759
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:26,942
It's just a matter of time.

760
01:05:27,142 --> 01:05:27,982
What I'm proposing here

761
01:05:28,223 --> 01:05:31,864
Is that you recognize the inevitable.

762
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:33,825
I don't know what woman
You're talking about.

763
01:05:34,065 --> 01:05:35,145
First you lost your briefcase,

764
01:05:35,346 --> 01:05:37,827
And now you've lost some woman.

765
01:05:37,947 --> 01:05:40,148
You ought to be more careful.

766
01:05:40,347 --> 01:05:44,830
The people I work for
have a large investment in this matter,

767
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:47,831
And they are very determined.

768
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:49,951
They sound like interesting people.
Very interesting.

769
01:05:50,152 --> 01:05:52,272
You have a good dental plan?

770
01:05:52,473 --> 01:05:54,513
What I'm talking about

771
01:05:54,714 --> 01:05:58,115
Is probably 1 0 times
what you earn in a year,

772
01:05:58,315 --> 01:06:00,436
Including whatever you
steal on your expense account.

773
01:06:00,635 --> 01:06:02,836
I don't steal.
I like an honest man.

774
01:06:03,037 --> 01:06:05,638
So do I.
10 times.

775
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:09,520
You could never make that much
if you worked another 30 years.

776
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:12,281
Possibly you won't survive that long.

777
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:16,122
that's true.

778
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:18,963
All you have to do is point her out

779
01:06:19,163 --> 01:06:22,005
And look the other way.
Now, that's not much effort

780
01:06:22,204 --> 01:06:24,405
For more money than you ever dreamed of.

781
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,006
And no risk to you at all.

782
01:06:27,207 --> 01:06:29,207
You go through the motions
of guarding her.

783
01:06:29,408 --> 01:06:30,808
We'll take care of the rest.

784
01:06:31,008 --> 01:06:35,489
This offer doesn't stay
on the table too long.

785
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:39,731
There are a few things to know
before making your decision.

786
01:06:39,932 --> 01:06:44,413
Jack, show him what you have.

787
01:06:46,934 --> 01:06:48,695
Do you know what this is?

788
01:06:48,895 --> 01:06:50,976
I have a feeling You're going to tell me.

789
01:06:51,176 --> 01:06:54,017
Somethings happened to the
communications gear on this Trai

790
01:06:54,217 --> 01:06:56,618
There's no way for anyone to radio ahead.

791
01:06:56,898 --> 01:06:58,579
that's a shame, isn't it?

792
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:00,059
The other interesting item

793
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,941
Is that when this train
reaches its destination,

794
01:07:03,141 --> 01:07:04,542
Some people will be waiting for you.

795
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:07,423
Quite a few of them.
They're not like us.

796
01:07:07,663 --> 01:07:11,104
Now, we have no desire
for needless violence.

797
01:07:11,304 --> 01:07:13,185
We're professionals, like you.

798
01:07:13,385 --> 01:07:15,226
T o have an ugly incident occur on this train

799
01:07:15,425 --> 01:07:16,786
With no method of escape

800
01:07:16,986 --> 01:07:18,547
isn't in our self-interest, either.

801
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:21,308
However, the men waiting for you,

802
01:07:21,549 --> 01:07:23,509
that's a different matter.

803
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:25,309
They simply won't let you and that woman

804
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:28,591
Get off this train and walk away.
It's that simple.

805
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:30,952
I've been doing some checking on you.

806
01:07:31,192 --> 01:07:32,633
You have an interesting resume.

807
01:07:32,873 --> 01:07:36,395
T op of your law school class.
A decorated marine.

808
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:40,236
And you have a reputation
for being a very good prosecutor.

809
01:07:40,476 --> 01:07:44,318
You also have a reputation
for having a big mouth.

810
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:46,038
It seems you pissed off too many people.

811
01:07:46,238 --> 01:07:48,519
You're never going to be the district attorney.

812
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:50,760
It's a shame, isn't it?

813
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,960
I suppose There's two reasons

814
01:07:52,161 --> 01:07:54,202
Why someone would remain
a deputy district attorney.

815
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:57,083
You're either rich or afraid to
go out on your own.

816
01:07:57,282 --> 01:08:00,204
There's a third reason.

817
01:08:00,404 --> 01:08:02,405
I don't like people like you,

818
01:08:02,605 --> 01:08:04,766
And I really don't like people
like your boss.

819
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:07,807
I enjoy putting you away. I really do.

820
01:08:08,007 --> 01:08:11,208
If I wanted to make money,
I'd have to defend you.

821
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:14,329
That wouldn't be any fun.
I'd always feel like showering.

822
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,930
I enjoy sitting in a courtroom,

823
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,252
Watching the judge pass sentence,

824
01:08:18,451 --> 01:08:21,933
As your shirt collar
starts to get a little tight.

825
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:25,174
I'll love sitting there watching Leo Watts.

826
01:08:25,374 --> 01:08:26,895
I like my courtroom side.

827
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:29,856
Pay's not so good, but the air's a lot better.

828
01:08:29,976 --> 01:08:33,657
I'm offering you enough money
to make your whole life different.

829
01:08:33,897 --> 01:08:37,738
don't tell me that
You're above temptation.

830
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:40,180
I'm very tempted at your offer, yes.

831
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,621
There's just one small problem.
What's that?

832
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:47,263
I don't know who this woman is
you keep talking about.

833
01:08:47,463 --> 01:08:48,984
I'll really enjoy this.

834
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:52,065
Give it a rest.

835
01:08:52,265 --> 01:08:54,905
There are no more stops
between here and Vancouver.

836
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:57,907
Neither of you can get off the train.

837
01:08:58,107 --> 01:09:00,428
You don't have a lot of choice.

838
01:09:00,628 --> 01:09:02,109
Think about it.

839
01:09:02,349 --> 01:09:03,469
I will.

840
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:05,910
Do you really think
you can get her off this train?

841
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:10,552
Get who?

842
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:13,954
Well, uh...

843
01:09:14,153 --> 01:09:18,635
Thank you for the coffee.
Uh-huh.

844
01:09:19,516 --> 01:09:21,757
I've really enjoyed this little chat.
I really have.

845
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:24,078
I must go now.
We'll talk again.

846
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:28,719
Yeah, well... I'm in the book.

847
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:48,047
It's me.

848
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:52,729
Jesus Christ, what happened?

849
01:09:53,009 --> 01:09:56,771
Your friend Leo Watts has
a buddy in the d.a.'s office.

850
01:09:56,971 --> 01:09:58,291
His name is Dahlbeck.

851
01:09:58,491 --> 01:10:00,652
Those two guys he sent here,
they weren't cops.

852
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:03,933
I thought you were dead.
Well, I'm not.

853
01:10:04,053 --> 01:10:06,375
When I get to L. A., Dahlbeck is mine.

854
01:10:06,615 --> 01:10:10,176
If you get there.
We'll get there. I'll take care of it.

855
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:12,257
Are you telling me not to worry

856
01:10:12,457 --> 01:10:14,257
While you work everything out?

857
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:18,739
This is my life we're dealing with.

858
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,940
I thought you were dead

859
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,662
And I was on my own.
You prance in here with your fancy I. D.

860
01:10:23,861 --> 01:10:25,302
And tell me not to worry?

861
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:29,704
You're really a jerk.

862
01:10:29,944 --> 01:10:32,464
My friend Leo Watts?

863
01:10:32,665 --> 01:10:33,985
Do you know what really happened?

864
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:36,427
I mean, do you know anything about me?

865
01:10:36,626 --> 01:10:41,108
I know You're Michael Tarlow's
girlfriend.

866
01:10:41,869 --> 01:10:42,949
It must be really nice

867
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:47,591
Not to let knowledge get in your way.

868
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,713
I never met Michael Tarlow in my life

869
01:10:52,913 --> 01:10:56,315
Before that night.

870
01:10:56,514 --> 01:10:57,875
I was fixed up on a blind date

871
01:10:58,075 --> 01:11:02,437
By a well-meaning friend.

872
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:04,878
I saw a man get murdered.

873
01:11:05,078 --> 01:11:09,080
I don't know if he was good man or he was bad man.

874
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,480
I saw someone take his life

875
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,002
As casually as you'd buy a stick of gum.

876
01:11:15,202 --> 01:11:18,323
It's not like it is on television.
It Was horrible.

877
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,125
It's not a part of my life.

878
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:22,805
It's something you read about,

879
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:27,367
Except that it never happens to you.

880
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:30,288
Ohh...

881
01:11:30,528 --> 01:11:32,169
I don't know how I got home that night.

882
01:11:32,369 --> 01:11:34,570
The most difficult part was acting normal

883
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:38,531
When I paid the babysitter.

884
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,212
Yes. I have a son.

885
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:42,613
He's 10 years old.

886
01:11:42,813 --> 01:11:44,014
But I thought you would have known th at,

887
01:11:44,214 --> 01:11:46,734
Since you know everything about me.

888
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:50,256
I just went into his room that night
and watched him sleeping.

889
01:11:50,456 --> 01:11:53,577
Thought maybe the sight of
that kind of innocence

890
01:11:53,778 --> 01:11:56,058
Would make the world seem less horrible.

891
01:11:56,298 --> 01:11:58,060
It didn't.

892
01:11:58,259 --> 01:11:59,739
It was all over the 1 1 :00 news

893
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,101
Who Michael Tarlow was,

894
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:02,901
That he was a lawyer

895
01:12:03,142 --> 01:12:07,583
For this... famous gangster
named Leo Watts.

896
01:12:08,143 --> 01:12:10,184
They had a photograph of Leo Watts on television.

897
01:12:10,384 --> 01:12:12,385
That was the man in the hotel room.

898
01:12:12,585 --> 01:12:16,466
All I could think of was to run.

899
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:18,827
I took my son to his father' s house.

900
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:22,429
I told his father to go away right then.

901
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,110
Not to tell anybody where he was going,

902
01:12:24,309 --> 01:12:26,431
Not even me.

903
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:30,872
I knew I had to get
as far away from my son as I could.

904
01:12:31,072 --> 01:12:33,353
I went to my brother's cabin.

905
01:12:33,553 --> 01:12:36,075
It's so remote I thought
I'd be safe there.

906
01:12:36,274 --> 01:12:38,235
I figured no one could find me.

907
01:12:38,435 --> 01:12:40,476
So don't you ever judge me.

908
01:12:40,676 --> 01:12:43,397
don't you dare.

909
01:12:43,598 --> 01:12:48,079
I'm scared stiff.

910
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:53,321
I don't want to die.

911
01:12:54,282 --> 01:12:57,723
I'd gladly die for my son, however.

912
01:12:57,923 --> 01:13:01,445
This is not just about me.

913
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:04,406
I would like to do the right thing.

914
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:07,047
I really would. I just--

915
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:09,608
I'm just so scared.

916
01:13:09,808 --> 01:13:14,290
This is not just about me.

917
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:18,892
So Here's the program.

918
01:13:19,092 --> 01:13:20,972
You're going to tell me what's going on,

919
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:24,133
And you'll tell me your ideas
if you have any.

920
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:28,815
I need to know.

921
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:32,897
I'm sorry.

922
01:13:33,138 --> 01:13:36,058
They still don't know where you are.

923
01:13:36,259 --> 01:13:37,820
I don't think they'll move tonight

924
01:13:38,059 --> 01:13:39,180
Because they don't have to.

925
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:40,301
We have to do something

926
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,702
Before this train makes the last stop, though.

927
01:13:44,902 --> 01:13:47,823
We can't get off the train.

928
01:13:48,063 --> 01:13:52,385
There isn't anybody I can call for help.

929
01:13:52,585 --> 01:13:55,466
They've got somebody else on the train

930
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:57,187
Besides the two guys.

931
01:13:57,387 --> 01:14:01,829
I think I know who it is--
a big, fat guy.

932
01:14:02,269 --> 01:14:04,350
I, uh...

933
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:08,591
I don't know exactly
what I'm going to do.

934
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:10,672
I just know that I've--

935
01:14:10,873 --> 01:14:15,314
I have to make my move
before they make theirs.

936
01:14:16,114 --> 01:14:16,875
Why don't you try to get some sleep now?

937
01:14:17,115 --> 01:14:20,357
You're going to need it.

938
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,357
I can't sleep.

939
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:26,999
don't worry. I'll  be up.

940
01:14:31,321 --> 01:14:35,202
You should wash that.

941
01:14:35,402 --> 01:14:39,884
Thank you.

942
01:15:10,896 --> 01:15:12,097
Ooh. Oh...

943
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:15,218
It's OK.
Nothing's happened.

944
01:15:15,418 --> 01:15:17,379
OK? We're not dead yet?

945
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:21,300
No... we're not dead yet.

946
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:23,342
Well, that's good.

947
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:26,223
I'm leaving you alone for a little while.

948
01:15:26,423 --> 01:15:28,824
Where are you going?
T o the dining car.

949
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:30,865
There they can't get by me

950
01:15:31,064 --> 01:15:33,626
Without my seeing them first.

951
01:15:33,866 --> 01:15:38,308
If they come after me,
at least you won't be right next to me.

952
01:15:46,591 --> 01:15:48,272
You'll be all right.

953
01:15:48,471 --> 01:15:51,593
Would you like some coffee?

954
01:15:51,793 --> 01:15:56,275
That would be nice.

955
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:16,243
Freeze, mister.
You're not robbing this train.

956
01:16:16,443 --> 01:16:18,563
Jesus Christ.

957
01:16:18,764 --> 01:16:19,964
That thing's not for real, is it?

958
01:16:20,204 --> 01:16:24,366
Course not. I'm a kid.
You could get hurt pointing that.

959
01:16:24,566 --> 01:16:27,127
You could go to j ail for robbing people.

960
01:16:27,327 --> 01:16:29,728
I'm not a robber.
I don't believe you.

961
01:16:29,928 --> 01:16:31,529
Now, uh...

962
01:16:31,729 --> 01:16:32,929
Listen, I got to go.

963
01:16:33,129 --> 01:16:35,850
I didn't say you could move.

964
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:39,132
Well, I got to go.
I'll be watching you.

965
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:39,972
what's your name?

966
01:16:40,173 --> 01:16:42,894
Nick.

967
01:16:43,133 --> 01:16:44,494
Do you always go around
pretending You're a cop?

968
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:46,254
Sometimes I'm the bad guy.

969
01:16:46,455 --> 01:16:48,735
I understand. It pays better, right?

970
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:52,097
But now You're a cop.

971
01:16:52,297 --> 01:16:56,739
Can you keep a secret?
Of course.

972
01:17:04,902 --> 01:17:07,904
Suppose I told you I was really a cop.

973
01:17:08,144 --> 01:17:11,505
No way.
Suppose I could prove it to you.

974
01:17:11,705 --> 01:17:14,026
Suppose I asked you for your help.

975
01:17:14,225 --> 01:17:15,186
Would you give it to me,

976
01:17:15,386 --> 01:17:18,387
Without telling anybody,
not saying anything to anyone?

977
01:17:18,588 --> 01:17:23,069
Prove it.

978
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,391
Is that real?
Yes, it is.

979
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:28,192
No shit.

980
01:17:28,432 --> 01:17:31,633
This doesn't say You're a cop.
I can read.

981
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:32,953
doesn't it say deputy?

982
01:17:33,154 --> 01:17:35,315
Are you on a case?
Big one.

983
01:17:35,514 --> 01:17:37,355
Where's your gun?

984
01:17:37,555 --> 01:17:38,675
I don't have it.

985
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:41,276
If You're a real cop,
how come you don't?

986
01:17:41,517 --> 01:17:43,918
That's the problem.
The bad guys took it.

987
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:47,719
Are you kidding me?
No. I need your help.

988
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:48,920
You do?

989
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,561
I need to borrow your gun.

990
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,681
But it's not real.

991
01:17:51,881 --> 01:17:54,402
Well, we won't tell
anybody about that, OK?

992
01:17:54,602 --> 01:17:56,603
Raise your right hand.

993
01:17:56,803 --> 01:17:58,844
Put your left hand on the gun.

994
01:17:59,044 --> 01:18:00,364
I'm going to deputize you.

995
01:18:00,565 --> 01:18:02,366
According to California state laws

996
01:18:02,565 --> 01:18:04,847
And international laws of criminal justice,

997
01:18:05,046 --> 01:18:08,488
I hereby deputize you as special assistant...

998
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:11,649
Uh, subject to all the laws of, uh...

999
01:18:11,849 --> 01:18:15,050
Secrecy and jurisprudence, so help me god. Say I do.

1000
01:18:15,251 --> 01:18:16,971
I do. What does it mean?

1001
01:18:17,171 --> 01:18:18,972
It means, um...

1002
01:18:19,172 --> 01:18:20,853
If you say anything about this,

1003
01:18:21,052 --> 01:18:23,334
Your ass is grass.
OK.

1004
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:26,975
OK, deputy.
Go see your mother now. Just act normal.

1005
01:18:27,175 --> 01:18:31,616
Yes, sir.

1006
01:18:36,139 --> 01:18:37,740
Good morning, sir.
Would you like some breakfast?

1007
01:18:37,939 --> 01:18:40,941
Uh, no, thanks. Just some coffee,
please. Black.

1008
01:18:41,141 --> 01:18:45,622
And a cup of coffee to go.
Certainly, sir.

1009
01:18:47,863 --> 01:18:49,744
Well. Good morning.

1010
01:18:49,944 --> 01:18:51,104
Good morning.

1011
01:18:51,345 --> 01:18:52,706
Mind if I join you?

1012
01:18:52,905 --> 01:18:55,226
I'm just having coffee.
I'm not having breakfast.

1013
01:18:55,427 --> 01:18:57,147
Um... oh, of course.

1014
01:18:57,268 --> 01:19:01,749
Please. Sit down.
Thank you.

1015
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:08,271
Sleep well?
Not much.

1016
01:19:08,472 --> 01:19:09,873
Me, too.

1017
01:19:10,072 --> 01:19:13,233
It's so difficult to sleep on a train.

1018
01:19:13,434 --> 01:19:16,195
God, It's beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, yes.

1019
01:19:16,395 --> 01:19:18,716
Good morning, ma'am.
Would you care for some breakfast?

1020
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:21,757
Um, just some tea, please.
And some toast.

1021
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,117
What kind of bread?

1022
01:19:23,357 --> 01:19:27,799
Any kind. Wheat?

1023
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,801
You, um, getting coffee for someone?

1024
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:32,802
No. I thought I'd have a cup here

1025
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:35,202
And take a cup back to the compartment.

1026
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:38,964
I have reading to do before we get in.

1027
01:19:39,164 --> 01:19:40,725
What kind of work do you do?

1028
01:19:40,924 --> 01:19:44,286
Mmm. Sales.

1029
01:19:44,486 --> 01:19:46,327
What do you sell?

1030
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:48,288
Construction, um... Supplies.

1031
01:19:48,528 --> 01:19:50,128
Heavy equipment.

1032
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:54,770
Oh, I see.
You don't look like the salesman type.

1033
01:19:55,531 --> 01:19:57,331
What type is that?

1034
01:19:57,531 --> 01:19:58,532
Well, somebody who looks comfortable

1035
01:19:58,772 --> 01:20:00,412
With a name tag on their pocket.

1036
01:20:00,613 --> 01:20:04,214
Hello, my name is...
Yes. I don't have to do that.

1037
01:20:04,414 --> 01:20:08,896
Your toast is coming.
Thanks.

1038
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:13,057
Where are you from?
Uh, Los Angeles.

1039
01:20:13,297 --> 01:20:15,619
Oh, I go there quite often.

1040
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:19,260
In fact, I'm going to be there
next week.

1041
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,501
I stay at the, um, the belair.

1042
01:20:22,742 --> 01:20:26,183
that's a very nice place.

1043
01:20:26,383 --> 01:20:28,544
Would you like to see me?

1044
01:20:28,744 --> 01:20:29,904
What did you say? I'm sorry.

1045
01:20:30,104 --> 01:20:33,786
Nothing. It's not important.
No, what did you say?

1046
01:20:33,986 --> 01:20:35,187
I feel like an idiot.

1047
01:20:35,386 --> 01:20:39,228
I asked if you'd like to see me again.

1048
01:20:39,428 --> 01:20:41,148
How's she doing?
Your wife.

1049
01:20:41,349 --> 01:20:42,790
How's she doing?

1050
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:45,671
I gave him my compartment.
He had coach seats.

1051
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:49,753
His wife looked ready to have the baby.

1052
01:20:49,952 --> 01:20:51,753
She's doing fine, thank you.

1053
01:20:51,953 --> 01:20:53,554
that's very kind of you.

1054
01:20:53,754 --> 01:20:55,915
I hope you and your wife
were not uncomfortable.

1055
01:20:56,155 --> 01:20:58,436
Hell, no. We played cards all night.

1056
01:20:58,636 --> 01:21:01,117
I cheat. So does she. But I cheat better.

1057
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:04,798
that's why she's buying breakfast.

1058
01:21:04,999 --> 01:21:06,839
Well, I got to be going.

1059
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:08,400
Hope everything turns out right.

1060
01:21:08,599 --> 01:21:10,601
Thank you. You don't understand.

1061
01:21:10,841 --> 01:21:13,162
I do understand.
Please.

1062
01:21:13,362 --> 01:21:14,203
You don't have to apologize.

1063
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:18,844
No, please. I just--
I can't explain. Please.

1064
01:21:22,365 --> 01:21:24,367
Come with me.
What?

1065
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:25,327
Come with me now.

1066
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:26,607
I don't want to.

1067
01:21:26,807 --> 01:21:30,448
I'm not asking, I'm telling.
You're in danger.

1068
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:32,450
What's going on here?

1069
01:21:32,649 --> 01:21:35,611
What is it?

1070
01:21:35,811 --> 01:21:37,971
Ow!

1071
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:39,812
Where are you taking me? Who are you?

1072
01:21:40,052 --> 01:21:40,373
Those two guys think You're someone else.

1073
01:21:42,614 --> 01:21:44,935
Let go of me!

1074
01:21:45,134 --> 01:21:46,615
Get in your compartment and lock it.

1075
01:21:46,815 --> 01:21:48,936
My compartment's back the other way.

1076
01:21:49,136 --> 01:21:50,097
You can't go that way.

1077
01:21:50,297 --> 01:21:52,858
Tell me what's going on.

1078
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:57,540
I don't have time.

1079
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:58,980
What's the problem here?

1080
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,581
This man-- no problem.
Looks like There's one to me.

1081
01:22:01,781 --> 01:22:03,341
I don't give a shit.

1082
01:22:03,582 --> 01:22:05,343
No way to talk.

1083
01:22:05,542 --> 01:22:08,744
Come with me. The name's Keller.
Railroad security.

1084
01:22:08,944 --> 01:22:10,425
Step away from the lady
and come with me.

1085
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:11,665
You're a railroad cop?

1086
01:22:11,865 --> 01:22:14,866
Two men on this train are trying
to kill someone.

1087
01:22:15,067 --> 01:22:16,867
They' re after a woman.

1088
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:20,029
I know who you mean.
I've been watching you all.

1089
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:20,949
Where is she?

1090
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:24,311
She's safe. I believe they think
she's the woman.

1091
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,071
How can I help?
Where's your compartment?

1092
01:22:26,311 --> 01:22:30,753
One car behind us.
Let's go there.

1093
01:22:34,755 --> 01:22:36,956
Keep her in there.
They won't think to look there.

1094
01:22:37,155 --> 01:22:39,596
I can call ahead for help.

1095
01:22:39,797 --> 01:22:40,957
Communications aren't out?

1096
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:43,038
Mine's a portable.
Have your people contact

1097
01:22:43,277 --> 01:22:45,238
The Los Angeles district
attorney's office.

1098
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:48,680
Have them ask for chief deputy district
attorney martin Larner.

1099
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,161
No one else. that's important.

1100
01:22:51,362 --> 01:22:55,003
I want them to tell Larner that
Dahlbeck is dirty.

1101
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:56,403
Do it right away.

1102
01:22:56,603 --> 01:23:01,085
Listen. It's not just your grocer
who loves you.

1103
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:05,327
It's Caulfield.

1104
01:23:05,526 --> 01:23:08,288
What took you so long?

1105
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:12,970
We're going to change compartments, OK?

1106
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:17,932
What happened?
Things are looking up.

1107
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:21,173
I'm going to put you in a railroad
cop's compartment.

1108
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:25,775
If nothing else, it'll give us
a little time.

1109
01:23:30,977 --> 01:23:32,257
Jesus Christ.

1110
01:23:32,378 --> 01:23:35,379
Oh!

1111
01:23:35,779 --> 01:23:38,340
They took her.
Who?

1112
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,261
There was a woman in here.

1113
01:23:40,421 --> 01:23:43,982
They thought she was you.
Oh, dear god.

1114
01:23:44,222 --> 01:23:47,184
Oh!

1115
01:23:56,908 --> 01:24:01,389
Get out of the way!

1116
01:24:08,592 --> 01:24:11,593
Wait!

1117
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:26,840
Get on the roof!.
I can't!

1118
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:28,480
You don't have any choice.

1119
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:33,122
don't think. Just do it.

1120
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:41,845
When you get on the roof, lie flat!

1121
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:47,568
You're doing fine!

1122
01:25:34,747 --> 01:25:37,708
End of the line, asshole.

1123
01:25:37,908 --> 01:25:39,949
Wiggle your ear. Wiggle your toes.

1124
01:25:40,189 --> 01:25:44,631
Come on. I want to do you.

1125
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:50,593
Toy gun.
Ha ha ha ha!

1126
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:39,292
Let's go!
I can't move! I'm afraid!

1127
01:26:39,493 --> 01:26:41,574
Yeah, so am i. Let's go. Come on.
I can't.

1128
01:26:41,773 --> 01:26:46,335
Come on.

1129
01:28:47,784 --> 01:28:50,665
Aah!

1130
01:28:50,866 --> 01:28:53,826
Aah!

1131
01:28:57,428 --> 01:29:00,429
Oh!

1132
01:30:59,437 --> 01:31:03,478
I don't want you. Just her.

1133
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,039
You understand.

1134
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:08,040
It's strictly business.

1135
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:12,682
You should have taken the money.

1136
01:31:14,443 --> 01:31:16,924
You know what i like about you?

1137
01:31:17,124 --> 01:31:18,204
You're tall.

1138
01:31:18,404 --> 01:31:21,366
Oh!

1139
01:31:39,213 --> 01:31:39,733
Larner.

1140
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:40,693
This is Caulfield.

1141
01:31:40,893 --> 01:31:42,014
Where have you been?

1142
01:31:42,214 --> 01:31:44,655
No time to explain. Listen.

1143
01:31:44,855 --> 01:31:46,935
Our friend Dahlbeck works for Leo Watts.

1144
01:31:47,136 --> 01:31:48,896
We wound up on a train.

1145
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:51,938
The trains stopped.
I'm calling you from a farmhouse.

1146
01:31:52,138 --> 01:31:54,098
I'm about 100 miles from Vancouver.

1147
01:31:54,299 --> 01:31:55,059
The woman is safe.

1148
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:56,620
I've contacted the Canadian authorities.

1149
01:31:56,819 --> 01:31:58,260
They'll be here any minute.

1150
01:31:58,541 --> 01:31:59,300
Get in touch with them.

1151
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:00,381
Meet us at the border.

1152
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:05,023
I'm on my way.

1153
01:32:07,464 --> 01:32:10,386
And then the man told
Mr. Tarlow not to be afraid.

1154
01:32:10,585 --> 01:32:12,506
I remember he said,
Michael, You're acting

1155
01:32:12,707 --> 01:32:15,708
As though you think I'll harm you.

1156
01:32:15,907 --> 01:32:18,989
And, uh, then he told Mr. Tarlow

1157
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:21,310
That he was to go back to New York

1158
01:32:21,509 --> 01:32:24,711
And pay back all the money he owed.

1159
01:32:24,951 --> 01:32:27,152
Then he started to walk toward the door,

1160
01:32:27,392 --> 01:32:30,713
And he stopped and turned around
and said,

1161
01:32:30,914 --> 01:32:33,114
Michael, I lied.

1162
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:35,235
Then the other man that was with him

1163
01:32:35,515 --> 01:32:39,917
Turned around and pulled out a gun...

1164
01:32:40,197 --> 01:32:41,798
And shot Mr. Tarlow.

1165
01:32:41,998 --> 01:32:45,480
Did Mr. Tarlow call anybody
in the room by name?

1166
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,081
Yes, he called the man Leo.

1167
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,481
Did you get a clear look at Leo?

1168
01:32:50,641 --> 01:32:51,682
Yes.

1169
01:32:51,882 --> 01:32:53,723
Could you identify him?
Yes.

1170
01:32:53,922 --> 01:32:56,084
Is he here now?
Yes.

1171
01:32:56,284 --> 01:32:57,764
Could you point to him?

1172
01:32:57,965 --> 01:33:00,726
Yes.

1173
01:33:00,925 --> 01:33:05,367
It's that man sitting right there.

1174
01:33:09,249 --> 01:33:11,130
Let the record state that the witness

1175
01:33:11,329 --> 01:33:14,051
Has pointed to Mr. Leo Watts.

1176
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:18,732
Thank you, Miss Hunnicut.
