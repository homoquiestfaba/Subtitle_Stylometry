2
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,834
Anybody home?

3
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,374
<i>Walter?</i>

4
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,455
<i>...complete</i>
<i>with emergency vehicles</i>

5
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:14,493
<i>from as far away as Oakland.</i>
<i>Fire crews from Union City</i>

6
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,696
have joined Newmont detachments
<i>from all seven stations,</i>

7
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,731
<i>and although the fire</i>
<i>is contained,</i>

8
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,802
<i>it still burns fiercely</i>
<i>inside the food court itself.</i>

9
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,438
<i>Now, early reports</i>
<i>point to a gas main</i>

10
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,342
<i>ruptured by a PG&E repair crew</i>
<i>as the cause of the explosion</i>

11
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,345
<i>in the food court, but</i>
<i>this has yet to be confirmed.</i>

12
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,582
Oh, my God.

13
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:39,451
<i>Once again, there was a tragic</i>
<i>explosion earlier this evening</i>

14
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,720
<i>at the Newmont shopping mall.</i>
<i>Ten lives have been lost,</i>

15
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,523
<i>and the list of the injured</i>
<i>continues to grow.</i>

16
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,725
Yup.

17
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,394
<i>This is Michelle Gould</i>
<i>reporting live from Newmont.</i>

18
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,929
Hungry?

19
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,632
Yeah.

20
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,641
My princess,

21
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,510
I bring you savory shish kebabs

22
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:09,648
made by authentic savage Pakis.

23
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,583
I wanted fried chicken, Ali.

24
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,552
But this is better.

25
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,591
Really?

26
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,860
Mm-hmm.

27
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,676
Is Walter home?

28
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,645
No.

29
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,848
Let me just check.

30
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,917
Just a sec, just a sec.
Let me just check.

31
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,391
<i>Hey, it's Walter.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

32
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,426
He's not picking up.

33
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,028
Let me check the machine.

34
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,596
Okay.

35
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,804
<i>Hey, Mom, Dad.</i>

36
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,773
<i>My phone died, again,</i>

37
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,841
<i>and this was the only number</i>
<i>I could remember.</i>

38
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,710
<i>Anyway, I'm going over</i>
<i>to the mall.</i>

39
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,545
<i>Can one of you pick me up?</i>

40
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,647
<i>I'll just hang in the</i>
<i>food court. See you later.</i>

41
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,395
I'll call you.

42
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,549
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

43
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,651
It's dislocated!

44
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,458
Please, I just... No, no.
I've got to go in.

45
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,460
I've got to get...
I think my kid is in there!

46
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:02,794
Ma'am, please step back!

47
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,696
Excuse me, I have a real
reason to go in there.

48
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,898
My son was at the mall today,

49
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,401
and I haven't been able
to reach him, so I...

50
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,670
Look, lady, nobody
is getting in here tonight!

51
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,406
There must be someone who can
tell me if he's in there or not!

52
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,641
Talk to the officer
out by the front entrance.

53
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,878
He has a number
that you can call.

54
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,481
<i>At approximately</i>
<i><i>4:15 P.M., a gas line exploded</i>

55
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,483
<i>near the north side</i>
<i>of the building.</i>

56
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,852
<i>We have to stress that</i>
<i>we do not have confirmation</i>

57
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,422
<i>as to the exact nature</i>
<i>of the blast.</i>

58
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,741
Eddie?

59
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,595
No. No, we're almost home.

60
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,132
Okay. We'll let you know

61
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,534
as soon as we hear from him.

62
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,136
Thank you.

63
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,811
I need a smoke.

64
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,823
Munsif?

65
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,216
Oh, hello.

66
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,218
I'm inspector Kalkowitz.

67
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,821
You must be Mrs. Pelletier.

68
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,990
Please have a seat.

69
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,672
Would you like some tea?
White tip Jasmine.

70
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,996
I'm sorry about your son.

71
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,665
Don't.

72
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,335
Okay, I'll get to the point.

73
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,104
These days, you know,
somebody sets off

74
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,773
some firecrackers
in their backyard,

75
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,810
and we get about a thousand
calls for a terrorist alert.

76
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,713
What do you mean?
I thought it was a gas leak.

77
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:18,750
Well, let's say it was
a gas leak for now, okay?

78
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,385
The point I'm trying to make
is that there's a bunch...

79
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,020
I don't give a shit
about any of that.

80
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,788
You keep interrupting me.

81
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,323
Just get to the point!

82
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,325
You don't want to make
an enemy out of me,

83
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,227
because if you did,

84
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,262
you'd be losing
a very important friend.

85
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,765
Shall I tell you why?

86
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,900
Because I lost my son in Iraq.

87
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,941
So let's talk about Eddie.

88
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,919
Here are your son's ashes.

89
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,855
I'm sorry for your loss.

90
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,659
Take as much time as you need.

91
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,177
Sorry to make you folks
keep coming down here.

92
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,946
When will you know
what caused the gas leak?

93
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,215
Well, we're doing everything
we can, Mr. Munsif.

94
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,559
I need to use the restroom.

95
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,917
Um...

96
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,921
I'm Lea.

97
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,190
I'm Maryam.

98
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,560
You lost your son.

99
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,139
Me, too.

100
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,017
Have you been to the memorial?

101
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,688
Yeah.

102
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,158
I've been wanting to go,
but I just...

103
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,993
I just haven't been able to.

104
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,265
I could take you.

105
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,054
Ready?

106
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,389
Who is she?

107
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,690
One of the mothers.

108
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,346
What do you want?

109
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,714
I need to talk to you.

110
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,521
I shouldn't have had
to find out

111
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,223
that my son died from the news.

112
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,291
Jesus Christ!

113
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,160
Come on, Lea.
I had a right to know.

114
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,796
You had a right.
You had a right?

115
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,765
Eddie had a right to a father

116
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,067
to a father who spent
time with him.

117
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,535
Eddie had a right
not to live like this!

118
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,071
Don't forget, Lea,
I didn't divorce you.

119
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,773
You divorced me.
You pushed me away!

120
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,508
You kept me from him!

121
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,376
I divorced you. Not Eddie.

122
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,378
That doesn't mean
you stop caring about him,

123
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,147
stop supporting him!

124
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,282
I never stopped caring
about him, ever!

125
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,689
I should've been
at his funeral.

126
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,128
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you came?

127
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,596
You don't think
you're a good Christian

128
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,265
because you missed the funeral.

129
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,699
Is that what this is about?

130
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,334
Oh, Saint Charles,

131
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,470
you might be damned
like the rest of us!

132
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:55,073
That's not what this is about.
That's not why I'm here.

133
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,110
Well, why are you here?

134
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,112
Because I didn't think
that either one of us

135
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,747
should go through this alone.

136
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,363
I should go.

137
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,167
Yeah.

138
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,462
He's handsome.

139
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,333
What was his name?

140
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,268
Eddie.

141
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,270
He just turned 15.

142
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,773
Walter just turned 16
last summer.

143
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,911
All he wanted was a car
for his birthday.

144
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,613
But my husband
wanted him to wait

145
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,348
until he went off to college.

146
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,520
Tell me more about Eddie.

147
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,322
What was he like?

148
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,460
He was always a good kid.

149
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,363
Sweet kid.

150
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,803
I tried to give him space,

151
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:43,541
but I should have
picked him up the day...

152
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,653
And afterwards she told me

153
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,955
how her husband became
an evangelical,

154
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,491
and they couldn't do
the things they used to.

155
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,596
They couldn't even put on masks

156
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,665
and go trick or treating.

157
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,368
We know all about
that kind of fanatic.

158
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,270
Mm-hmm.

159
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,976
Yammi?

160
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,679
Hmm?

161
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,981
We still have
each other, don't we?

162
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,596
Walter is... gone.

163
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,940
We could have another...

164
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,947
I can't do it.

165
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,510
Hello?

166
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:43,047
Oh. Oh, God. Again?

167
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,591
Hi.

168
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,627
Hi.

169
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,697
Do you know what they want?

170
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,499
I have no idea.

171
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,767
Mrs. Pelletier, Mrs. Munsif,

172
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,736
You both brought
recent pictures

173
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,938
of your sons, right?

174
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,708
If I could have them for
a moment, I'll make copies.

175
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,577
Can you tell us
what this is about?

176
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,146
I'll have them back to you
before you leave.

177
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:19,283
Mrs. Pelletier,
you can come in now.

178
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,918
I'll see you at 3:00.

179
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,620
I'll pick you up.

180
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,221
Oh, okay.

181
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,560
Ms. Pelletier,
I'm Special Agent Reese,

182
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,829
and you should know
some things have happened

183
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,797
to change the nature
of this case.

184
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,199
Case? What do you mean?

185
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,034
I didn't know there was a case.

186
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,903
Remember I told you
about the firecrackers

187
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,905
in the backyard?

188
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,974
Well, one of them went off.

189
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,976
The ATF has found
evidence that there were

190
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,045
two explosions
at the food court that day.

191
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,914
The first one was a bomb,

192
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,783
which then set off
the gas main explosion.

193
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,719
What?

194
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,087
Your son was killed by a bomb.

195
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:06,997
Oh, my God... A bomb.

196
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,800
We're sorry. We're very sorry.

197
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,969
What happened?

198
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,673
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out, okay?

199
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:19,677
Did your son, by any chance,
know this kid Walter?

200
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,178
Walter Munsif?

201
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,315
No.

202
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,150
Do you know the Munsifs at all?

203
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:29,019
Well, I met her here
the other day.

204
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,188
Do you have any reason
to suspect that her son

205
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,223
could've had anything
to do with it?

206
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,225
The bombing?

207
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,132
My God!

208
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,301
You think Maryam's son
had something to do with it?

209
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,103
That is horseshit!

210
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,805
Well, how can you be so sure

211
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,239
if you only met her
a few days ago?

212
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,975
I don't know. I can just tell,

213
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,910
just like I can tell
you're an FBI bitch,

214
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,012
and you should not be calling me
with this kind of crap.

215
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,847
Okay, all right. Lea, we...

216
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,816
Mrs. Pelletier,

217
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,752
I've got a bomb
and a Pakistani kid,

218
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,887
so I'm sure you can appreciate

219
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,023
where we're going
to have to go with this.

220
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,259
Can I go?

221
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,179
Don't tell them shit.

222
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,152
There were hundreds
of people there,

223
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,287
but you assume Walter did it.

224
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,791
Mrs. Munsif, you were
born in Pakistan?

225
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,326
Yes,

226
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,328
but I'm an American citizen.

227
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,929
I've been here for 18 years.

228
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,332
And your husband, Ali.

229
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,801
He was born there, too?

230
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,270
Yes, he also is
an American citizen.

231
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,774
It says here that
your husband was brought in

232
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,410
for questioning
in December 2001,

233
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,378
in connection
with an investigation

234
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,980
into the Logan Street Mosque.

235
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,182
Does it also say there

236
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,851
that he was kept there
for 3 days,

237
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,787
and that he didn't
have a lawyer,

238
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,755
and that his family had no idea

239
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,691
what was happening to him
and was terrified?

240
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,926
And then you let him go,

241
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,095
a case of mistaken identity.

242
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,364
No apology, nothing.

243
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,202
Yeah, it does.

244
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,871
So, how did you feel
after all that?

245
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,940
How would you feel
if you were us?

246
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,176
We're American citizens.

247
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:35,045
We pay our taxes,
we follow all the rules,

248
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,047
and then you come and
take us away for no reason,

249
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,882
other than we look different?

250
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,851
How would you feel?

251
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,953
I'd be angry.

252
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,322
I'd be furious,

253
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,825
and maybe if I'm young
and impressionable,

254
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,160
like any 16-year-old,

255
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,830
and I get mixed up
with the wrong people,

256
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,898
then maybe I'd want
to take some revenge.

257
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,434
We were not angry like that.

258
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,336
We were upset
like anyone would be

259
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,171
if they were treated
wrongly or unfairly.

260
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,507
Is that about it, Agent Reese?

261
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,110
Yeah, that's it.

262
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,746
We'll call you when we need
to see you, Ms. Munsif.

263
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,314
<i>Thank you.</i>

264
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,125
<i>They said</i>
<i>it was a bomb.</i>

265
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,964
What?

266
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,832
That killed Walter.

267
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,201
They're starting
an investigation.

268
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:34,171
<i>They mentioned</i>
<i>the Logan Street Mosque.</i>

269
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,173
It's starting again.

270
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,442
<i>Walter didn't do</i>
<i>anything wrong.</i>

271
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,277
We need to get a lawyer.

272
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,045
<i>Ali, let's just wait!</i>

273
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,514
They'll see Walter is innocent.

274
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,854
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm just
going out with Lea.

275
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,457
I'll stop by the restaurant
after we're done.

276
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,826
Maryam, be careful
what you say to her.

277
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,227
<i>Why?</i>

278
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,163
Because you don't know her.

279
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,497
You don't know
what she could do.

280
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,965
Ali, she lost her son, too.

281
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,574
So, tell me about the time
Walter was arrested

282
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,976
for fighting
at the movie theater.

283
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,045
Do you know why
he got into that fight?

284
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,680
No. Tell me.

285
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,682
Because the other boy
was saying

286
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,684
horrible things to him,
racist things.

287
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,953
Did Walter often
behave like that?

288
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,088
Impulsive? Hotheaded?

289
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,694
Walter was a quiet,
regular boy.

290
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,996
He loved reading history.

291
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,464
He loved playing the guitar...

292
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,667
Oh, come on, Mrs. Munsif.
He broke that kid's jaw

293
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,535
at the fight
at the movie theater.

294
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,607
You made a terrible mistake
accusing my husband.

295
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,076
Don't do the same with my son.

296
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,483
Was Walter involved
in any significant way

297
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,185
with the Logan Street Mosque?

298
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,587
No.

299
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,957
Well, what if I told you

300
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:43,660
We have photos of him
entering the Mosque

301
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,462
on at least two occasions?

302
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,301
Maybe there was some kind of
celebration or something, but...

303
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,370
So, Walter wasn't involved

304
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,305
with any radical groups,
jihadists,

305
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,442
people with anti-American
or anti-Western ideologies?

306
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,310
No. Walter loved this country.

307
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,512
We love this country.

308
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,115
Which is why I'm sure you're
going to be totally cooperative

309
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:07,117
with us.

310
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,179
What happened, Maryam?

311
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,150
They have pictures of Walter

312
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,119
outside Logan Street Mosque.

313
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,057
Was he going to the mosque?

314
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,695
What would he go there for?

315
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,099
I don't know.

316
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,235
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

317
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,406
What are we going to do?

318
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,778
I think we should move back.

319
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,713
Back?

320
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,085
It's only going to get worse.

321
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:18,121
And leave everything
we've built and crawl back?

322
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,159
I talked to Yusuf's Uncle.

323
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:24,194
His cousin Tazim
is going to buy my share

324
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,495
of the restaurant.
I think it's a good idea.

325
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,364
This is not happening, Ali.

326
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,632
We're not going back there.

327
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,367
You're talking
about our homeland,

328
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:33,336
where our families come from.

329
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,738
Sure, we have our madmen.

330
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,339
Sure, we have 20 million people

331
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,741
shitting in the streets,

332
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,409
but at least we're not
circling the world

333
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,378
dropping bombs
at everything we don't like!

334
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,740
What do we have here that's
so goddamn precious anyway, huh?

335
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,085
Give me a mud hut
on a dusty street.

336
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,220
Give me biryani
on a filthy plate

337
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,255
in the middle of a stinking
market, with an open sewer

338
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,458
running through it.
At least we'd have our son!

339
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,333
I didn't mean it.

340
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,402
You did.

341
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,517
Mrs. Munsif, Mrs. Munsif!

342
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,320
We just need
a little bit of your time.

343
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,287
How do you feel the police

344
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,223
are handling
this investigation?

345
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,191
Mrs. Munsif!

346
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,726
Was your son involved
in the blast?

347
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,608
Was your son involved
in the blast, Mrs. Munsif?

348
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,313
Hi, Janet? This is Maryam.

349
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,149
Yeah, I just wanted
to let you know

350
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,718
that we've got
some great new listings.

351
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,820
Yeah, and the condo
we looked at last week,

352
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,489
the one you really liked...

353
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,359
Yeah, well, they've just
dropped their asking price.

354
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,294
So, um...

355
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,831
Oh. Okay, okay...

356
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,935
Yeah, I do understand,
but, you know,

357
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,703
it's a good time to buy.

358
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,743
Okay. Yeah, okay.

359
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:22,245
Just call me when you're ready.

360
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,914
Yeah. You, too.

361
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,360
Sorry I haven't come by.

362
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,296
I wasn't sure.

363
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,198
I thought you might
want to be alone.

364
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,666
Yeah, that's okay.

365
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:45,535
I feel so bad. I just
don't know what to say.

366
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,672
There's nothing to say.

367
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,607
I mean, who could do
such a thing?

368
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,610
What could have possibly
been going through

369
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:56,279
that Muslim kid's head?

370
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,447
They don't really know
what happened.

371
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,482
Come on. You saw the article.

372
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,618
Angry Muslim kid,

373
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,687
always fighting
with American kids.

374
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,856
Father was a suspect
during 9/11.

375
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,678
What the hell
are you doing here?

376
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,780
Did my husband let you in?
Why are you in my house?

377
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,383
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't
go in there right now.

378
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,285
Don't tell me what
I can do! This is my...

379
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,519
Sorry, ma'am. We have
a search warrant.

380
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,322
Mrs. Munsif, please
wait downstairs.

381
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,424
You have no right to be here.

382
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,627
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

383
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,495
Harder than it has to be?

384
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,298
That's my son's room!

385
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,899
We're done checking
the bedroom, ma'am.

386
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,901
Anything?
A couple of transmitters.

387
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,638
These are my son's toys.

388
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
They're ordinary toys!

389
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:58,441
Here's a copy
of the search warrant.

390
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,609
<i>Our suspect,</i>
<i>a Pakistani-American juvenile,</i>

391
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,778
<i>claimed he was being harassed</i>
<i>with racial insults</i>

392
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,613
<i>by group of teenagers.</i>

393
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,816
<i>An altercation ensued,</i>

394
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,719
<i>and the suspect broke the jaw</i>
<i>of a 14-year-old boy.</i>

395
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,019
Where are you going?

396
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,929
Oh, my God. Call the police.

397
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,402
What for? They think
we are terrorists, too.

398
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,636
So we do nothing?

399
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,905
Wake up, Maryam.

400
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,630
We're going to do
some pass-bys during the day,

401
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,666
keep our eye on things,
all right?

402
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:11,701
Now, I've lived around here
for a long time.

403
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,871
I know most of these people
around here are good people,

404
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,539
but, you know, we don't
blame you 'cause you've got

405
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,775
some you-know-whats
in your country,

406
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,877
so we hope you don't blame us
because we've got our share.

407
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,046
Let me tell you something.

408
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,515
About a million years ago,
I get out of the Academy.

409
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,984
I've got to go on a patrol
with this guy Terry Sikorsky.

410
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,753
He's an old school cop.
He's a veteran,

411
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:33,556
30 years on the job, Ukrainian.

412
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,825
We're down in the Tenderloin,
and he busts this guy Winston.

413
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,794
Winston's got a kilo of shit
in his shirt.

414
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:40,897
Shit?

415
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,099
You know, heroin, dope.

416
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,602
Sikorsky busted him
twice before. He cuffs him.

417
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:49,239
Winston turns to Sikorsky
and says, "The harm is done."

418
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,741
I don't get it.

419
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,676
We're back at the station,
and I ask Sikorsky,

420
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,678
"What do you mean
'the harm is done'?"

421
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
Sikorsky looks at me,
and he says,

422
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,816
"It's what people do to people.

423
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:02,685
What does it matter
who did it? The harm is done."

424
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,158
So, if I'm you,
I'd stay put and fight.

425
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,205
Tim!

426
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,873
Hey, Tim!

427
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,675
Hang on a second.

428
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:26,709
What the hell is going on?

429
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,244
What?

430
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,013
You gave half my shift
to Juanita.

431
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,614
The woman can barely
speak English.

432
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:34,317
I'm not getting any
complaints about Juanita.

433
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,786
You're getting
complaints about me?

434
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,756
Yeah. Lots.

435
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,291
Okay, okay. Listen.

436
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:42,926
I've got to have these shifts.

437
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:44,561
You took away Wednesday
and Thursday,

438
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:45,929
and I've got
to have these shifts,

439
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:47,163
or I'm not going
to be able to make it.

440
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,765
Come on, man. Help me out.

441
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,600
Look, I know you're going
through some tough times...

442
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,802
Tough times. Tough times.

443
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,304
That's what you call it,
tough times? You have no idea

444
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:56,105
what the hell
you're talking about.

445
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,007
Lea... Do you know what
I've been dealing with?

446
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:01,044
Lea, calm down.
Look, this is serious.

447
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:03,613
If your work doesn't improve,
I'm going to have to let you go.

448
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,648
You can consider this
your official warning.

449
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,218
This is bullshit!

450
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,132
From the guy down there.

451
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,902
I can't talk
about this anymore.

452
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:08,705
We lost our son.

453
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,440
Somebody threw a brick
through our window.

454
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,308
You're losing your clients.

455
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,144
People will realize
that Walter didn't do it.

456
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,913
And you're sure that's
what they're going to find?

457
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:17,980
Aren't you?

458
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:20,083
My son was not a murderer,

459
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:22,218
but what does that matter?
Things are changing.

460
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,020
People are desperate.
They'll believe anything now!

461
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:26,122
This is our home, Ali.

462
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:27,890
We have to defend it.

463
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,492
That is fine for the cops
because they have guns,

464
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:31,294
and they can protect
themselves.

465
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,062
We are foreigners here
and always will be.

466
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,464
They see a gun
in the hand of a Muslim,

467
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:37,100
and he's a terrorist.

468
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,469
Kalkowitz can't know
what that feels like.

469
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:42,138
His son died in Iraq.

470
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,073
That's what I'm saying,
right there.

471
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,043
His son died in Iraq.

472
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:48,878
What does that tell you?

473
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,292
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

474
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,095
Ali and I had a terrible night.

475
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,968
You lied to me.

476
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,237
What?

477
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,039
What are you talking about?

478
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,842
I never lied to you.

479
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,477
Have you been drinking?

480
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,246
Why, you want to drink?

481
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,248
No, you don't do that,

482
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,283
but your son hanging out
with terrorists,

483
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,219
beating up white kids,
that's okay.

484
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,456
Why didn't you tell me
that Walter had been arrested?

485
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,491
Why didn't you tell me that?

486
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,796
What you read or heard
in the news

487
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,098
is just not true.

488
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,067
Walter is innocent.

489
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:47,470
I trusted you!

490
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,919
I told you my secrets.

491
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:06,556
I told you about my Eddie,
and all along you knew.

492
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:09,025
Stop it! Stop it! You knew!

493
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:11,060
You of all people

494
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,496
should understand
what I'm going through.

495
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,568
And I thought
you were my friend.

496
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,442
Your friend.

497
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,548
How?

498
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,350
How can I be your friend?

499
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,492
Your son killed Eddie.

500
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,276
That's what I thought.

501
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,270
So a week ago,
this is all bullshit,

502
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,272
and now this kid
is a suicide bomber?

503
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:32,975
You asked me if I had reason
to suspect him, and now I do.

504
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,377
Are you aware of the fact
that your kid

505
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,112
was being bullied at school?

506
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:38,014
Eddie was being bullied?

507
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:39,548
Yeah. We were going
to call you.

508
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,517
Yeah? Where are you
getting this from?

509
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,386
Well, we've got witnesses.

510
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,288
He was standing at
a bus stop on Sullivan,

511
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,356
behind the school.
This bunch of kids

512
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,292
comes up to him,
starts picking on him,

513
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,327
pushing him around. One
of them grabs his knapsack,

514
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,329
throws it out into the street,

515
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:55,631
and Eddie says,
"This is the last time

516
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,967
you assholes are going
to do this to me,"

517
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,036
and one of the kids
stops laughing

518
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:01,971
long enough to say to him,
"Yeah, Eddie. What are you

519
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,272
going to do about it?"
and you know what Eddie says?

520
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,308
No, what?

521
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,343
He said, "Because I'm going
to kill you. All of you."

522
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:11,213
Bullshit. You're making it up.

523
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:13,149
That's bullshit?

524
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:14,951
Yes, it's bullshit!
Don't you think I would know

525
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:16,953
if my son was being bullied?
He would have told me!

526
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,988
Do you know a kid
named Andrew Hull?

527
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,289
No. Do you know a kid
named Richie Palmer?

528
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,724
No. Bobby Mason?

529
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,292
What, are these the boys
that you say were fucking

530
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,593
with my kid? Yeah!

531
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,429
Then I want to talk to them.

532
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:28,297
You can't talk to them, Lea,
because two of them are dead,

533
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,599
and one of them is in a coma!

534
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,104
That's a hell of a coincidence,
don't you think?

535
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,707
Huh? You going to
meet me halfway here?

536
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:40,042
Well, Eddie had nothing
to do with it.

537
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:41,377
Look, I'm going to get
to the bottom of this,

538
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,646
with or without your help.

539
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,355
Hi.

540
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,156
Hi. I'm glad you called.

541
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,192
Yeah. Come on in.

542
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,729
Just sit down.

543
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:01,230
Okay.

544
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,698
Do you want something to drink?

545
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,069
What are you going to have?

546
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,771
Beer.

547
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,673
Beer sounds good.

548
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,341
I've mellowed with age.

549
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,110
Huh.

550
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,250
Thank you.

551
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,731
So?

552
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,433
The police suspect Eddie.

553
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,301
What?

554
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:41,370
They're saying
that he threatened

555
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,672
to kill some kids, and then
three of those kids

556
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:45,474
died in the explosion.

557
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:47,176
There's no way that Eddie

558
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:49,578
had anything to do
with this bombing.

559
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,516
I just wanted to tell you
that, you know, I...

560
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:56,719
I tried. I tried to be
a good mom.

561
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,821
I wanted Eddie
to be a good person,

562
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:01,424
just like you did.

563
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,726
I tried to love him...

564
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,264
Take good care of him.

565
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:11,333
Lea, I know. I know.

566
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:14,503
Don't beat yourself up.

567
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,839
Do you remember when, um...

568
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,374
When he was a baby,

569
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:20,443
just starting to crawl?

570
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:23,479
We were living with
your folks in Redding,

571
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:26,482
and somehow he got outside
into the backyard,

572
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:29,618
and he started eating
all those daffodils?

573
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,121
One after another, he must have
eaten about 20 of them?

574
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:34,290
Yeah, and you were convinced
he was going to die.

575
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,327
Yeah, I remember.

576
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,529
I didn't know what to do,

577
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:44,133
and you were just so calm.

578
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,602
You just picked him up

579
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,838
and drove us straight
to the emergency room.

580
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,439
Remember that?

581
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,442
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

582
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,444
A lot of good it did.

583
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,513
They didn't do anything,
told us not to worry.

584
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:00,783
Remember, you almost took
that nurse's head off.

585
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,319
Well, she was a bitch.

586
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,190
Oh, Lea.

587
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,430
Don't be so tough, Lea.

588
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,367
Let me in.

589
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,305
Let me help you.

590
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,775
Just a little bit.

591
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,380
Okay?

592
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,225
I thought his room
would be messier.

593
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,394
No, I cleaned it.

594
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,396
I mean, he always had...

595
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:22,364
piles of clothes everywhere.

596
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,468
He was a good kid.

597
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,939
He had strange taste
in music, though.

598
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,508
I think he got that from you.

599
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,411
Probably. You want some juice?

600
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,401
We should think about suing
the police for harassment.

601
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,520
There is no way our son
was involved in that bomb.

602
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:47,256
You've got some poor,
angry Muslim kid

603
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,325
who was probably raised
by uneducated fanatics

604
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,860
who taught him he could
bomb his way into heaven.

605
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:53,862
I mean, what is it, 70...

606
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,864
77 virgins? Some shit.

607
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,533
Don't.

608
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,001
What?

609
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,639
Oh, God. I'm supposed to be PC

610
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,841
about people who don't
belong here in the first place?

611
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:09,345
No way. They get
what they deserve.

612
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,982
Did Eddie get what he deserved?

613
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,625
You know what I meant.

614
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,396
Yeah.

615
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,567
I know what you meant.

616
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,037
You know, I have
a really busy day today.

617
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:39,408
Yeah.

618
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,378
Yeah. Okay.

619
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,813
Okay.

620
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,651
Ms. Pelletier.

621
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,691
Eleanor. Eleanor.

622
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:32,394
Was there a woman
asking about me?

623
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:34,463
Oh, yes.

624
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:35,698
What did she want?

625
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,533
What do you think?

626
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:39,468
I don't know.
What did she want?

627
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,442
You can keep it.

628
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,426
Kalkowitz here?

629
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,994
I tried calling, but
I just got his voice-mail.

630
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,596
He's in the field today.

631
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,748
How does it feel now?

632
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,383
How do you like
everyone accusing you?

633
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,584
He didn't do it.

634
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:29,786
That's not what the papers say.

635
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:31,420
Come on! You were right.

636
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:34,490
Maryam... No.

637
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:36,558
We can't be friends.

638
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:42,431
Your son is a murderer.

639
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,449
Hey, it's wild mommy,
from that video.

640
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,053
Gordian Knot time, baby.

641
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:13,562
<i>Hi, I'm Eddie.</i>

642
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:16,565
<i>So, my dad's, like,</i>
<i>this religious nut,</i>

643
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,901
<i>but I haven't seen him</i>
<i>for, like, 10 years</i>

644
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:22,638
<i>'cause he's too busy</i>
<i>praying, or something.</i>

645
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,606
<i>Mom's pretty cool, though.</i>

646
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,876
She takes me to concerts a lot.

647
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,546
<i>Pretty wild mommy, huh?</i>

648
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,085
<i>You know,</i>
<i>to tell you the truth,</i>

649
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,455
<i>I don't really give a shit.</i>

650
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:41,690
<i>They got the game</i>
<i>stacked out there.</i>

651
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,158
<i>You have to fit</i>
<i>into their little molds</i>

652
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,993
<i>and their</i>
<i>little fucking cliques,</i>

653
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,862
<i>and if you're</i>
<i>anything different,</i>

654
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:48,964
<i>you're some fucking freak</i>
<i>that they can push around</i>

655
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,099
<i>whenever they feel like it</i>
<i>'cause you're nothing to them.</i>

656
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:53,101
<i>You're just a thing to them.</i>

657
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:54,870
<i>You've got to be Quiet Wyatt.</i>

658
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:56,672
You just sit there and take it,

659
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:59,508
while they take all the credit,

660
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,177
but it's Gordian Knot time now.

661
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,682
<i>Yeah.</i>

662
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,260
Yes, hello.

663
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:20,796
Um, I would like
to send flowers

664
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,799
to a patient, and I need
the room number, please?

665
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,901
Uh, Robert Mason?

666
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:31,840
Here you go.

667
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,909
Thanks.

668
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:36,278
Thanks for coming over,
Nausheen.

669
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,580
I'm sorry I couldn't
return your calls.

670
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:40,148
I meant to. It's just that...

671
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,852
How are you holding up?

672
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,056
Oh God, I miss Walter so much.

673
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,761
We barely even spoke
the last few months.

674
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,598
We were always so busy.

675
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,200
I hardly saw him.

676
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,937
I know what you mean.

677
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:04,973
I used to see him and Jawad
all the time,

678
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:08,110
but I hadn't seen him in ages.

679
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,946
He ate dinner at your place
the night before the bombing.

680
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:12,814
No, he didn't.

681
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:14,983
Yes, he did.

682
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:16,885
No. I'm positive.

683
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,221
I would've remembered.

684
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,100
I need to talk to you
about something.

685
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,139
When was the last time
you met Walter?

686
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:39,741
I don't know.
About two months ago.

687
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,679
So, he wasn't supposed
to have dinner with you

688
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,614
the night before the bombing?

689
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:47,616
No. We really just weren't
hanging out that much,

690
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:48,884
you know, for a while.

691
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:50,586
Since when?

692
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:52,120
Maybe the last
half a year or so.

693
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,922
Ever since then,
Walter was different.

694
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,824
How so?

695
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,126
Well, he was pissed off.

696
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:01,129
He didn't talk about it much,
but he was really mad.

697
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,599
Like the fight he had
at the theater?

698
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah.

699
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:10,005
So if you guys weren't
hanging out, where was he?

700
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,007
I don't know. By himself.

701
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,875
At the mosque.

702
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:16,378
He even asked me
to come a few times.

703
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,913
At the Logan Street Mosque?

704
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:19,381
Yeah.

705
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:20,849
Did you go with him?

706
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,851
Yeah, once or twice.

707
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:42,904
<i>Dr. Hunton,</i>
<i>4814. Dr. Hunton, 4814.</i>

708
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,679
Aren't you Eddie's mom?

709
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,784
Yeah. You knew Eddie?

710
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:58,720
Yeah. We went
to school together.

711
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:01,657
I'm Robbie's brother.

712
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,893
Oh.

713
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,663
Oh. How is he doing?

714
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,932
Not good. Why are you here?

715
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,404
Oh, I don't know.

716
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:18,040
I mean, it's insane,

717
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,675
but they think Eddie
might have had

718
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:22,978
something to do
with the bombing.

719
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,980
Yeah, I know.

720
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,950
The police think your brother
was bullying him.

721
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:31,319
Yeah? My brother's
in a coma now.

722
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:36,091
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I didn't, I didn't mean to...

723
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,695
What's wrong?

724
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,115
Hey.

725
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,986
Is he going to be okay?

726
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,923
No. This whole thing
is just so fucked up.

727
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,858
I know.

728
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:14,129
I mean, we were just joking.

729
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:15,964
What do you mean?

730
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,365
The cops were right.

731
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:20,268
Robbie, the guys,

732
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,105
we were all just
jacking up Eddie.

733
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:25,006
Why would you do that to Eddie?

734
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:26,908
He's a freak!

735
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,111
Do you think he did it?
You think he did it?

736
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,879
We were at the bus stop,

737
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:32,482
and he says he's
going to kill all of us.

738
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,151
Just because he said it
doesn't mean he did it.

739
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:38,086
Just because he said things...

740
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,021
People say things all the time.
It doesn't mean he did it.

741
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:42,057
It wasn't what he said.

742
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,759
His eyes were dead.

743
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,361
And the bombing?

744
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,765
The bombing
was five days later.

745
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,194
My son Walter...

746
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:21,229
<i>As-salaamu alaykum.</i>

747
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:23,098
<i>Wa alaykum as-salam.</i>

748
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,167
I was at Walter's
funeral, Mrs. Munsif.

749
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:26,868
How are you getting along?

750
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,371
Was my son coming here
before he died?

751
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:32,574
Yes, he was.
Wonderful young man.

752
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:34,910
For how long?

753
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:37,579
I don't know exactly,
but for some time.

754
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,347
More so recently.

755
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:42,150
What was he doing here that
he couldn't tell me about?

756
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,352
Nothing.

757
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,955
He was praying,
learning about Islam.

758
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,926
What kind of Islam?

759
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:55,163
Mrs. Munsif,
Islam is a religion

760
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,566
of peace and charity, huh?

761
01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,101
We are not extremists
or jihadis here.

762
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:02,103
We are Americans.

763
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:03,839
We would never teach anything

764
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,207
that would be violent
or harmful to this country.

765
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:07,342
Why was he lying to me?

766
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,211
Why didn't he tell me
he was coming here?

767
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:11,146
I have no idea, Mrs. Munsif.

768
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:12,948
Go ask your husband.

769
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,855
My husband knew that
Walter was coming here?

770
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,456
Yes.

771
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,358
He came with him
a number of times.

772
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,963
Excuse me.

773
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,531
<i>When were you going to tell me?</i>

774
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,600
Tell you what?

775
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,969
<i>About Walter.</i>

776
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:10,105
What about Walter?

777
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,075
About Walter
going to the mosque.

778
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,979
Stop lying to me, Ali. I know.

779
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,348
I just spoke to the Imam.

780
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,250
Why didn't you tell me?

781
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,654
I would have,

782
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:27,555
but he made me promise
not to tell you.

783
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,024
Why?

784
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,026
Because he knew
how you'd react,

785
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:34,095
that you'd get angry
and try to stop him.

786
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,097
He was lost, Maryam.

787
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,666
I could see it.

788
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:39,501
He was angry.
He wasn't hanging out

789
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:41,303
with Jawad and
his friends anymore.

790
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,506
He needed something, Maryam.

791
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,015
What should I have done?

792
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:57,118
I don't know, but
you should have told me.

793
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:02,123
How can I ever
trust you again, Ali?

794
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:13,168
What? What is it?

795
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,603
What happened, Ali?

796
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:23,078
Well, at first
he studied with the Imam.

797
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:28,350
He's a good man.

798
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,151
But then he met...

799
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,723
Some of the more radical
people at the mosque.

800
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:37,158
Why didn't you do something?

801
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,260
Why didn't you stop him?

802
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,329
I tried, Maryam. I tried!

803
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,164
But the more
I told him to stay away,

804
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,733
the more he wanted
to be with them.

805
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,078
Do you think he did it?

806
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,684
He was a good kid, Maryam.

807
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:05,153
Do you think Walter did it?

808
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,265
I don't know.

809
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,204
I don't know.

810
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,355
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Hank Kalkowitz.

811
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:43,525
I'm head of the Alameda County
task force on terrorism.

812
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:47,295
As you know, this past month
we have been investigating

813
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:50,298
every aspect of the Newmont
shopping mall bombing,

814
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,301
where the two suspects we had
died in the explosion,

815
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:55,837
and the one eyewitness
was in a coma.

816
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,239
He was in a coma, that is,

817
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,108
up until this morning,
when he died.

818
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:03,511
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>you have no more leads?</i>

819
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,346
No, sir. That's not
what I'm saying.

820
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:07,515
I am not saying that at all.
We are going to follow up

821
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:09,717
on every lead we get,
but what I am saying is,

822
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,554
at this juncture,
I need to tell you

823
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:16,124
that this investigation
is going from active to ongoing.

824
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:18,159
But you know
one of those kids did it!

825
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:19,794
Aren't you going to do
anything about it?

826
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:22,363
Don't you owe us that much?

827
01:08:22,365 --> 01:08:24,132
Well, from my perspective, sir,

828
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:26,234
what we owe the community
is the truth,

829
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,503
and right now you're going
to have to bear with us

830
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,805
because we don't know
what that truth is.

831
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:32,307
Thank you.

832
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:37,312
I'd just like to assure everyone
we are not closing this case.

833
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:40,548
It is ongoing. What we'd like
to do with the rest of this time

834
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:43,151
is to answer any questions
that you might have.

835
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:46,554
<i>Linda, over here! Linda!</i>

836
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:48,356
<i>Linda! Have you had</i>
<i>pressure from the city</i>

837
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:50,158
<i>to shut down the</i>
<i>investigation because...</i>

838
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,759
<i>Can I get more</i>
<i>information</i>

839
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:53,761
<i>on the boy who just died?</i>

840
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,867
I thought I might see you here.

841
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,879
I'm sorry.

842
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,654
Me, too.

843
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,428
Do you think we'll ever
know what happened?

844
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,635
Would it change anything?

845
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,633
Go ahead.

846
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:00,134
No, that's okay.
I'll find another spot.

847
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:01,602
I don't mind.

848
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,738
All right.

849
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,483
You play?

850
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:17,718
Yeah. You?

851
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,087
Uh, yeah.

852
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,824
Mostly just
fool around, though.

853
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,659
How long have you been playing?

854
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:26,794
About two, two
and a half years or so.

855
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,996
That's cool.

856
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:30,965
So, what kind of music
do you like to play?

857
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,835
I like Green Day,
Dead Kennedys...

858
01:14:33,837 --> 01:14:35,470
So, like, the easy stuff?

859
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:36,771
Yeah.

860
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,141
Well, what kind
of guitar do you have?

861
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:42,143
A Fender. You?
