1
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,299
I thought I'd give you a lift.

2
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,966
What happened to you?

3
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,870
A rough night. Tell you later.

4
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,442
You okay?

5
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:01,470
Yeah, fine.

6
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:03,657
And the job?

7
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,849
Okay.

8
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,194
And your son...
Got him this weekend?

9
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,908
I don't know.

10
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,031
You're a real chatterbox.

11
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,310
We might take the kids
for the weekend.

12
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,753
I don't know what I'm doing Saturday.

13
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,154
Okay.

14
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,191
I'll quit inviting you.

15
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:48,357
What's he doing?

16
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,272
Move it!

17
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,354
Where's my coffee?

18
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,753
It's on its way.

19
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,792
About these night hours...
I can't stay.

20
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:13,114
You'll have to.
The extra is out sick.

21
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:15,314
- I need all hands.
- And my son?

22
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:18,193
Do like me, ask your wife.

23
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:22,551
Is the coffee walking in?

24
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:24,990
Get off me with your coffee.

25
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:54,512
Not working nights?

26
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:57,469
Great. We can team up now.

27
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:09,273
Hey buddy.

28
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,346
What's that?

29
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:18,072
Sorry, not mine.

30
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:20,427
Why are you sorry then?

31
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:22,553
Pick 'em up.

32
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:26,990
You deaf or something?

33
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:38,625
Pick 'em up.

34
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:40,672
That's a good boy.

35
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,393
Good little security car driver.

36
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,386
Hurry up.

37
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:51,827
Give.

38
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:53,106
Get lost.

39
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,147
Get lost, I said.

40
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,428
<i>/t rains every day...</i>

41
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,309
Manon, darling.

42
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:00,315
Auntie says you were a pain.

43
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,032
It's not true. I'm real nice.

44
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:04,306
<i>You're nice.</i>

45
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:06,707
<i>So auntie's a /iar?</i>

46
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:14,506
Listen, dear. I miss you too
but three days isn't long.

47
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:18,224
<i>You know your daddy</i>
<i>rea//y /oves you.</i>

48
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:19,994
I love you too.

49
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:23,232
<i>Auntie's taking me to a movie.</i>

50
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,347
A movie? Wow!

51
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,874
I have to hang up, honey.
I'll call you back.

52
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,067
- <i>Where are you, daddy?</i>
- At work.

53
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,831
I'll call again.
Be good to auntie.

54
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:36,345
A big kiss. I love you.

55
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:40,431
First, explain the dealers
in the parking lot.

56
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,986
Dealer-shootout-arrest...
will that do?

57
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:48,546
Sure. The court lawyer is suing for
assault and battery. Will that do?

58
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:50,553
Let him. What can I say?

59
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:53,154
Another mess like this
and I report you.

60
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:55,911
Is that clear?

61
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:02,634
What do we have here?

62
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:05,549
Marc Cipriani. Criminal record.
No trace of shells.

63
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:08,475
Scour the area.
See if you can find a witness.

64
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:12,114
Get to work.

65
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:21,269
Here we go again.
Damn it!

66
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,348
Forget about your party.

67
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,068
Then I'll run away.

68
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:32,425
If you do, I'll kill you.

69
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:13,908
<i>/f //eave a message about your son,</i>
<i>you might at /east ca// back.</i>

70
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,028
I was going to.

71
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:22,827
/ <i>managed for tonight</i>
<i>but what wi// you do tomorrow?</i>

72
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,183
I'll pick him up after judo.

73
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:30,387
<i>He to/d you. /t's his first match.</i>
<i>You have to be there.</i>

74
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:33,508
I'll be there.

75
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:36,429
/ <i>hope so.</i>
<i>He's counting on you.</i>

76
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:38,873
How's it going?

77
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,469
<i>Okay.</i>

78
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,389
<i>/t's at 11 o'c/ock. See you tomorrow.</i>

79
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:20,988
Wake up.

80
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:25,828
We make the arrest of the century
and that jerk takes credit.

81
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:27,745
He's telling it in our place.

82
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,708
- Where you going?
- Home. Alice is waiting.

83
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:32,988
Stay a while.

84
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,387
So long, guys.

85
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,311
- Coming?
- Be right out.

86
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:40,065
Go on and party, asshole.

87
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:01,906
Let's go.

88
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:05,103
Shit! I forgot Manon's gift.

89
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:08,023
- Be right back.
- No, wait.

90
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:47,746
Was he drinking?

91
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:51,943
He'll be struck off
the police force.

92
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,740
Three dead, including a child.

93
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:57,340
If he tests positive,
he goes down.

94
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:02,620
Simon...

95
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,504
Can you hear me?

96
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,741
That is a simple class exercise?

97
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,020
Yep.

98
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,785
Damn...

99
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,783
Was my dad really like you?

100
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,389
What do you mean like you?

101
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,659
A cop.

102
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,224
It's true. Why not?

103
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,668
It doesn't look like it.

104
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,022
I can assure you
he was a great cop.

105
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,229
Did you know
the people he killed?

106
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,739
But you know,

107
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,624
that wasn't his fault.

108
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,982
Then why did he go to jail?

109
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,661
It's not always your fault
when you go to prison.

110
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,823
Did your wife really die
when Manon was born?

111
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,300
Who's the cop, you or me?

112
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:34,347
Let's cut the questions

113
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,826
and exercise!
I won't do everything either.

114
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:41,345
Gabriel Hachour, drug dealer.

115
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,386
Same modus operandi
as this morning.

116
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:45,665
No cartridges but the same guys.

117
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:48,379
Where were you?

118
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:53,819
What about her?

119
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:55,866
His daughter, age 14.

120
00:14:57,109 --> 00:14:58,462
What else do we have?

121
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,307
The guardian heard a shot.

122
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:01,982
He saw a black car.

123
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,544
We're trying to trace tire tracks.

124
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:30,067
<i>Look at yourse/f.</i>

125
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,536
<i>You're just a ghost.</i>

126
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:34,018
We've been waiting two years
for you.

127
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:37,348
Right out of prison,
and you want to leave.

128
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:39,261
What did you expect?

129
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:44,386
What did you expect?

130
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:46,540
Will this bring them back?

131
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,465
We're alive.

132
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:52,383
We're alive! We're here!

133
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,458
Fight back.

134
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,021
Say something.

135
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:02,301
I'm sorry.

136
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:07,455
He's the one who's sorry.

137
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,621
Are you happy?

138
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:27,458
I swear, it was terrific.

139
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:34,059
- Make sure you get him home.
- I know. 8...

140
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:43,821
Came in first?

141
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,177
No, second.

142
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:49,419
Second place is good too.

143
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,421
Let's go.

144
00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:58,858
Aqualand would be nice.

145
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:00,465
We've been there.

146
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,021
You used to love the dolphins.

147
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:04,102
I was only six then.

148
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:06,464
Aqualand is for babies.

149
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:11,054
There's a match Sunday.
We've never done one.

150
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:14,665
Jean-Marc has a surprise for us.

151
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,464
Who's Jean-Marc?

152
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:31,056
Who's Jean-Marc?

153
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,134
A friend of mom's.

154
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,098
What's his surprise?

155
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,422
I don't know. It's a surprise.

156
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:53,096
I hope it's not Aqualand.

157
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,103
See you Saturday.

158
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:16,293
It's me.

159
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:05,974
What is it?

160
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,572
You're beautiful.

161
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:23,892
It's on the table.

162
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:35,778
Maybe we could
get together for real.

163
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,379
For real?

164
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:39,937
I mean

165
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:41,893
go eat.

166
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:43,892
I don't eat.

167
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:47,533
It explains your perfect figure.

168
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:51,455
What about a restaurant?

169
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:54,413
At the worst, you spend a great night

170
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:56,062
with a swell guy.

171
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,732
How do you like it?
Nice surprise.

172
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:30,934
Not for a child.

173
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,700
There are lots of kids.

174
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:43,618
And colors, music, animals.
Just like the circus.

175
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:48,976
Where are you going?

176
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:49,932
To the toilet.

177
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:51,531
Stay here. Not alone.

178
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,095
You'll miss the execution.

179
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:55,012
Go to the toilet.

180
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:58,299
Tell him to wait.

181
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:19,251
And now?

182
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:22,015
Should I go?

183
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,773
You have to stand up.

184
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,855
Look at him good.

185
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,337
Are you okay, honey?

186
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:56,609
Let's go.

187
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:58,053
We're not finished.

188
00:23:58,299 --> 00:23:59,732
He's seen them all twice.

189
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:00,849
Wait a second.

190
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:02,777
We won't find his picture.

191
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,816
These guys killed 5 people.

192
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:05,809
First, he gets rest.

193
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,333
He's the only witness...

194
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,013
He's my son, he's ten,
and he's going to rest.

195
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,291
First thing in the morning.

196
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:20,655
Do you know
where those guys come from?

197
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,978
Susini, what are you doing?

198
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:26,054
What do you do
for their protection?

199
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,448
Get a team together.

200
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,132
I'm the one who decides that.

201
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:32,052
Now get lost,
and let the police work.

202
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:33,329
I didn't hear that.

203
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:35,769
Don't touch me.

204
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:38,218
Fuck off, dickhead!

205
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:41,849
Fuck off where?

206
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,091
Close the door.

207
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:48,653
Get off me too.

208
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:00,128
I'll take you home.

209
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:03,411
- No, we'll manage.
- I'll take you home.

210
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:04,937
I said, no.

211
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,131
Your son needs rest
and not hollering.

212
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:11,490
So calm down
and with dignity for once.

213
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:07,290
I want you to rest.

214
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:08,247
Let's go.

215
00:26:22,257 --> 00:26:23,087
Théo...

216
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,287
come on.

217
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:37,531
Don't move!

218
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:44,205
Get down!

219
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:47,294
Théo, duck!

220
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:00,131
Théo, run for it!

221
00:27:15,616 --> 00:27:16,366
Run!

222
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,686
Don't move!

223
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:12,439
We'll get out of here.
Don't worry.

224
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,126
Hide!

225
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,645
Daddy!

226
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:25,362
Stop it, Simon!

227
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:28,158
Stop it, for chrissake!

228
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:31,288
Come on.

229
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:41,278
You okay?

230
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:44,083
Where's your son?

231
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:58,283
We're in the old market.

232
00:33:58,489 --> 00:33:59,524
Are you okay?

233
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:27,562
Are you okay?

234
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,880
Frank, come here.

235
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:43,323
Find a safe place for the night.
We can't take any risks.

236
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,405
I'll take them to my place.

237
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:47,527
I want Jacquet with you
all the time.

238
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:49,923
Jacquet, you watch the witnesses.

239
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:53,327
I want to see him
as soon as he can talk.

240
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:03,123
You're not hurt?

241
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:14,756
He's okay.

242
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:37,840
Will you sleep with me?

243
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,283
Yes, but not right now.

244
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,041
Daddy's gone?

245
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,325
He's still here.

246
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:53,326
Don't worry. He'll come to see you.

247
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,555
Good night.

248
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:26,364
He's waiting for you.

249
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,958
Where's your daughter?

250
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:52,084
At my sister's in Paris.

251
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:54,604
She left for a week.

252
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:59,274
It's your longest separation.

253
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:10,955
Don't.

254
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:13,839
What's wrong?

255
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:18,237
Better you don't stay here.

256
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,114
Okay.

257
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:25,514
I'll call you.

258
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:34,794
I'm sorry.

259
00:37:57,724 --> 00:37:59,077
Why would they hurt me?

260
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:04,394
You saw something
you shouldn't have.

261
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,563
Think they'll come back?

262
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:13,157
They won't come again.

263
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:21,874
Get some sleep.

264
00:38:29,964 --> 00:38:30,714
Daddy?

265
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:35,762
Did you also practice judo?

266
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:42,596
But a long time ago.

267
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:48,479
Good night.

268
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:06,471
- Sure you won't stay here?
- No, I'm going.

269
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:22,313
Take care of them.

270
00:39:22,803 --> 00:39:24,236
I'm counting on you.

271
00:40:02,162 --> 00:40:03,595
Working nights now?

272
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:22,992
What do you want?

273
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,753
What the hell are you doing here?

274
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:16,511
Get in.

275
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,919
I'm coming with you.

276
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,551
We'll take 'em on
like we used to.

277
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,632
Why are you doing all this?

278
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,954
All this what?

279
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,073
Being here for me.

280
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,992
I'm going it alone this time.

281
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:45,232
What's your game?

282
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:48,788
You're under arrest.

283
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:00,111
You won't make it on your own.

284
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,107
Nice of you to visit.

285
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:13,712
Pastor sent me.

286
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:16,558
I have better things to do
than keep you company.

287
00:43:17,919 --> 00:43:19,352
Is he awake?

288
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:22,948
And what with your pal gave him
he'll be sleeping a while.

289
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:25,473
I have time to buy you coffee.

290
00:43:26,558 --> 00:43:27,832
We're up for a coffee.

291
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:29,909
- You're on duty till when?
- 6:00.

292
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:31,628
I hate nights.

293
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:36,631
Make mine a short coffee.

294
00:43:36,998 --> 00:43:39,387
- It's no good.
- It rarely is.

295
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:01,626
See this bubble?

296
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:05,469
When it reaches your brain,
you're done for.

297
00:44:06,638 --> 00:44:07,832
Understand?

298
00:44:11,158 --> 00:44:11,908
Watch out.

299
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:14,156
You hit the "soup" button.

300
00:44:17,277 --> 00:44:20,189
Coffee makes me edgy at night.

301
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,591
Why are you and your friends here?

302
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,350
Why did you come here?

303
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,750
We came to do business.

304
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:50,436
What kind?

305
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:51,467
Heroine and girls.

306
00:44:52,477 --> 00:44:53,796
And my son?

307
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:55,027
Still in danger?

308
00:44:55,717 --> 00:44:58,948
He saw us. Milan never takes risks.

309
00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:02,756
Where can I find Milan?

310
00:45:04,957 --> 00:45:05,707
I don't know.

311
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:12,429
Where can I find Milan?

312
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:19,666
I don't know.

313
00:45:22,196 --> 00:45:23,026
Stop!

314
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:25,909
They meet tonight in a club.

315
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:26,986
Which club?

316
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:28,185
The Why Not.

317
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:31,389
I mean it, I'm not lying.

318
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,271
Wait...

319
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:39,951
Milan will realize
that I talked.

320
00:45:40,156 --> 00:45:41,874
Protect me or I'm dead.

321
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:46,224
You're dead.

322
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:52,751
To your health.

323
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:55,115
Here, I doubt it.

324
00:45:57,596 --> 00:45:58,745
Health...

325
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:03,026
Sure, hospital... health...

326
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,308
That was a good one.

327
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,546
- I knew you'd like it.
- Funny cop.

328
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:12,311
It's my cell.

329
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:14,271
I'm so sorry.

330
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:15,225
It's scalding hot.

331
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:16,629
Sure, it is.

332
00:46:16,835 --> 00:46:18,666
You should take it off.

333
00:46:18,915 --> 00:46:20,268
Look, it's all red.

334
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:21,749
Don't spread it.

335
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:23,274
Now you burned me.

336
00:46:23,475 --> 00:46:25,306
- I'll pay for the cleaning.
- Even a shirt.

337
00:46:25,515 --> 00:46:27,028
I wouldn't go so far.

338
00:46:27,595 --> 00:46:29,665
- Sure, it's a nice shirt.
- A nice make over.

339
00:46:40,995 --> 00:46:41,950
What's this club?

340
00:46:42,195 --> 00:46:44,072
It's also a brothel.

341
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:51,025
Is that them?

342
00:46:51,715 --> 00:46:52,830
Looks like them.

343
00:46:53,715 --> 00:46:54,670
Stay in the car.

344
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:56,906
Why is it always me?

345
00:46:57,195 --> 00:46:58,787
Because I'm your big brother.

346
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:01,031
- I'm coming along tonight.
- No.

347
00:47:01,275 --> 00:47:02,674
I have a bullet-proof vest.

348
00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:07,546
Fuck you.

349
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:09,233
You stupid turd.

350
00:47:35,474 --> 00:47:36,270
Come with me.

351
00:47:38,154 --> 00:47:39,303
Stay here and watch the door.

352
00:47:39,514 --> 00:47:40,390
Okay.

353
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:35,702
Sit down.

354
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,311
Can't you serve drinks?

355
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:22,942
I'm busy with the gentleman. Later.

356
00:49:27,272 --> 00:49:29,024
I'm not available.

357
00:49:31,312 --> 00:49:32,222
Shit, they're cops.

358
00:49:32,672 --> 00:49:34,264
I know that guy.

359
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:06,387
Are they yours?

360
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:14,827
Take a look.

361
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:16,907
Move it!

362
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:07,018
I'm okay.

363
00:54:26,427 --> 00:54:27,382
Go ahead.

364
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:30,214
Drop your gun!

365
00:56:35,584 --> 00:56:36,414
Drop your gun.

366
00:56:36,624 --> 00:56:37,534
Shut up and drop it.

367
00:56:41,304 --> 00:56:42,453
Drop it!

368
00:56:48,464 --> 00:56:49,499
Drop your gun!

369
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,098
Let's get outta here.

370
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:42,261
My brother.

371
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,814
Pastor's no genius,
but he'll make the connections.

372
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:17,620
You have to lie low.

373
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:19,177
We have to find them.

374
00:58:19,422 --> 00:58:21,299
Not with Pastor on your back.

375
00:58:21,982 --> 00:58:23,938
Alice and Théo have to leave town.

376
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,101
And the jerk at your place?

377
00:58:27,822 --> 00:58:29,619
I forgot about Jacquet.

378
00:58:34,822 --> 00:58:36,175
I said, go easy.

379
00:58:39,262 --> 00:58:40,411
You're crazy.

380
00:59:02,982 --> 00:59:04,700
It's the right thing to do.

381
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:08,701
My sister can take you in,
you have to leave.

382
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:10,215
You have to leave now.

383
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:24,894
Trust me.

384
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:31,813
Why don't you come with us?

385
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:33,813
Because I am.

386
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:38,294
I won't leave you alone.

387
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:51,692
We've been alone for years.

388
01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:03,815
I'll get Théo ready.

389
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,895
Why kill the kid now?
Everybody's seen us.

390
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,251
Screw the kid.

391
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,974
It's them I want.

392
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,856
I brought you
but I won't be involved.

393
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:44,970
Get rid of her.

394
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:26,929
Thanks.

395
01:02:18,098 --> 01:02:19,167
Be right back.

396
01:02:21,698 --> 01:02:22,448
Where you going?

397
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,290
To get a bite to eat.

398
01:02:38,698 --> 01:02:40,051
<i>This is Simon's voicemai/...</i>

399
01:02:41,938 --> 01:02:43,132
Can you call that TGV?

400
01:02:44,418 --> 01:02:45,567
Can you call the train?

401
01:02:45,818 --> 01:02:47,171
With the tunnels,
not before 10 minutes.

402
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:49,136
- The next stop?
- Aix.

403
01:02:51,577 --> 01:02:53,295
You let them beat you up?

404
01:02:56,457 --> 01:02:57,856
Where are they now?

405
01:02:58,057 --> 01:02:59,012
At his sister's.

406
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:01,168
You know the sister?

407
01:03:02,457 --> 01:03:03,606
You don't?

408
01:03:19,577 --> 01:03:21,568
<i>No network avai/ab/e</i>

409
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,609
I got you a coffee.

410
01:03:48,296 --> 01:03:49,615
What's this mess at the Why Not?

411
01:03:49,856 --> 01:03:51,050
There are more important things.

412
01:03:51,296 --> 01:03:53,651
Listen.
Get your ass down here now...

413
01:03:53,856 --> 01:03:54,606
<i>You /isten!</i>

414
01:03:54,856 --> 01:03:56,972
Send a team to block the TGV Aix...

415
01:03:57,216 --> 01:03:58,854
- No, you listen.
- <i>Shut up!</i>

416
01:03:59,096 --> 01:04:01,212
Simon's family is on board
along with the killers.

417
01:04:01,616 --> 01:04:05,006
<i>For once in your /ife,</i>
<i>do your job, assho/e.</i>

418
01:04:10,736 --> 01:04:11,691
What?

419
01:04:22,256 --> 01:04:24,167
Look downstairs,
we'll look up here.

420
01:05:33,255 --> 01:05:34,404
You all right, mister?

421
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:42,213
Get out, please.

422
01:05:51,974 --> 01:05:53,293
Tickets, please.

423
01:05:56,214 --> 01:05:57,693
Sorry, no tickets.

424
01:05:57,894 --> 01:05:59,930
That will be two fines.

425
01:06:00,334 --> 01:06:03,849
2 adults, plus 58 euros per person.

426
01:06:04,054 --> 01:06:05,772
For a total of 286 euros.

427
01:06:06,214 --> 01:06:08,364
You're lucky
I put you in second class.

428
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:31,126
Simon, they're on the train.

429
01:06:33,933 --> 01:06:35,252
Get down.

430
01:06:41,293 --> 01:06:42,806
What's that?
Come on.

431
01:07:04,213 --> 01:07:04,963
Get him out!

432
01:07:05,213 --> 01:07:06,362
Go!

433
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:23,121
Upstairs!

434
01:07:44,572 --> 01:07:45,322
Get down.

435
01:08:11,332 --> 01:08:13,050
<i>Our train has stopped on the tracks.</i>

436
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:15,123
<i>P/ease don't open the doors.</i>

437
01:08:46,291 --> 01:08:47,406
Come on,

438
01:08:47,611 --> 01:08:48,441
climb over.

439
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:52,919
Come out.

440
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:06,999
Downstairs!

441
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,128
It's open, follow me.

442
01:10:27,129 --> 01:10:28,608
Get out!

443
01:10:58,929 --> 01:10:59,884
Thierry?

444
01:12:41,967 --> 01:12:43,446
Run, Théo!

445
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:45,122
Mommy!

446
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:06,244
You okay, Simon?

447
01:13:07,206 --> 01:13:08,639
Look at me. You okay?

448
01:13:09,526 --> 01:13:11,596
Alice and Théo, run for it.

449
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:30,915
Let go!

450
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:12,724
Everything's all right.

451
01:15:44,444 --> 01:15:45,274
Let go!

452
01:15:46,324 --> 01:15:47,882
What are you doing?

453
01:15:50,244 --> 01:15:52,677
If you don't let go, you'll die too.

454
01:15:53,483 --> 01:15:54,802
What the fuck are you doing?

455
01:15:55,243 --> 01:15:57,837
You'll get us both killed.

456
01:15:58,083 --> 01:15:59,277
You're gonna die!

457
01:16:49,562 --> 01:16:50,961
It will be all right.

458
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,681
I'm sorry.

459
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:33,801
Let's go.

460
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:37,199
Shit, I forgot Manon's gift.

461
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:39,521
- Be right back.
- No, wait.

462
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,951
I thought you were dead.

463
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:42,766
I'm sorry.

464
01:20:27,402 --> 01:20:29,797
Frank Vasseur
has joined the long list

465
01:20:30,008 --> 01:20:31,890
of officers killed on duty.

466
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:33,895
Men like you and me.

467
01:20:34,098 --> 01:20:36,618
We choose to serve and protect

468
01:20:37,225 --> 01:20:39,870
without worrying about the risks.

469
01:20:40,994 --> 01:20:44,199
We don't become policemen by chance
but by conviction.

470
01:20:44,723 --> 01:20:46,159
Today we honor the man,

471
01:20:46,727 --> 01:20:49,247
the colleague
and most of all the friend.

472
01:20:49,815 --> 01:20:51,775
Those who knew him
will tell his daughter

473
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,819
about the policeman of valor,
the man of conviction,

474
01:20:56,069 --> 01:20:58,909
and most of all the model father.

475
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,637
Goodbye, Frank.
