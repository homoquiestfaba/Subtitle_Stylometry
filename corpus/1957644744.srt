1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:04,466
(suspenseful introductory music)

2
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,280
Multiple personality,

3
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,850
I don't feel right calling it that,

4
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,293
That's like I'm possessed.

5
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,083
Dissociative disorder.

6
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,440
That's better, yeah.

7
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,980
That's much better.

8
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,240
Like I can't make connections with my selves

9
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,433
or with the world.

10
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,500
It's like, sometimes I'll open a door somewhere,

11
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,593
and I'll be in a whole different place altogether.

12
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,320
And it'll be two hours later,

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,723
or even a whole day or night.

14
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,101
I just lose track of time in between.

15
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:37,700
(suspenseful music begins)

16
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,053
Like when I met Sean,

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,530
I don't really remember that,

18
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,020
or the wedding.

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,003
Though everybody tells me I was never happier.

20
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,163
I do remember Molly being born.

21
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:54,185
Oh God.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,423
That's when I learned what love really meant.

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,842
And when Rosie came along, feeling just doubled.

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,590
Having my family made me believe

25
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,320
that everything was gonna turn out wonderful after all.

26
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,030
Then my father was in his office last August

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,553
and everything came unglued.

28
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:30,553
Jim. Jim?

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,463
(Jim groaning)

30
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,950
Jim?

31
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,783
Hello, Jim?

32
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,803
Jim?

33
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:46,803
(suspenseful music intensifies)

34
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:56,574
Dr. Tremayne?

35
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:58,418
(telephone ringing)

36
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:00,086
Oh my God.

37
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:06,747
(telephone ringing)

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,233
Hello.

39
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,893
Oh, my God.

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,153
Suzy.

41
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,400
Suzy!

42
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:27,538
(hurried footsteps thumping)

43
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:32,190
Mom.

44
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,380
He's asked for you.

45
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:37,237
Daddy,

46
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:39,305
Daddy.

47
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:41,606
Hi, hi, hi.

48
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,481
Hi, Daddy.

49
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:47,727
(monitor beeping)
Jim? Jimmy?

50
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,622
Code blue!

51
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,143
(nurses and doctors frantically speaking)

52
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,163
Code blue, I need an EpiPen.

53
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:52,996
Coming through.

54
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:56,572
I need the paddles please, give me a charge.

55
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:57,530
Get in here with the paddles

56
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,447
Oh, my God, somebody!

57
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:02,821
(heart monitor goes flat)
Clear!

58
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,333
One more time, go in again.

59
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,457
Clear!
Oh my God. Oh my God!

60
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,499
Give me a charge again, one more time.

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,416
Daddy!
Clear!

62
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:14,123
Bonnie, look what I did.

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,072
Good honey.

64
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,967
Is it okay maybe if I play too?

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,803
If you want to that'd be fun.

66
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:31,128
(tense suspenseful music)

67
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,456
Look what mommy's doing.

68
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:38,956
I wanna do that.

69
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:44,095
(girls giggling)

70
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,425
So what's going on?

71
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:49,640
We're coloring, Daddy.

72
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,030
Yeah.

73
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,020
Girls, why don't you go inside,

74
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,159
and clean your face and your hands.

75
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,550
Come on, let's go.

76
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,063
Lookie my pretty picture.

77
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,270
What are you doing?

78
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,103
Why aren't you dressed?

79
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:01,710
We have to be there in 15 minutes.

80
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,150
Where?

81
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,200
The funeral.

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,352
Uh, I can't go like this.

83
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:13,435
No kidding.

84
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,543
You take the girls.

85
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,343
I'll get dressed and I'll meet you there, okay?

86
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,810
(door bell jingling)

87
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,393
Hi, can I help you?

88
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,232
Do you see this dress?

89
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:41,914
This is a really nice one.

90
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,313
And so it is said,

91
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:46,320
that I say Dr. Tremayne was far more

92
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,220
than just a caring citizen,

93
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,233
and a loving husband and father.

94
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,480
He was more even, then one of those rare- (fades out).

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,980
Another scotch, hun.

96
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,093
Ginger.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,833
It's Huff.

98
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:07,047
Sup?

99
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,160
Heard you were living with some guy.

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,993
Oh yeah, on and off.

101
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:15,285
Wanna make some money?

102
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:17,179
Eddie,

103
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,223
looking for a game?

104
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,263
Sure, why not.

105
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,185
Eddie, this is Ginger.

106
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:29,580
Hey Ginger.

107
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,016
How ya doing?

108
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,849
I'm doing just fine.

109
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,918
(slow sensual music)

110
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:40,868
You owe me 20 more.

111
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,113
(Eddie and Ginger moaning)

112
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:59,382
You like that? You like that?

113
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,314
Come on.

114
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,550
No, no.
What happened?

115
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,913
Everybody's freaking out.

116
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,133
You missed the funeral.

117
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,120
I called and called, why didn't you answer?

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,210
Who are you?

119
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,043
Suzy cut it out.

120
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:18,163
Come on, wake up.

121
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,861
We gotta call your mom, she's frantic.

122
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:22,332
Mom? Mommy!

123
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:23,166
Shh!

124
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,775
We waited a half hour for you before we started the funeral.

125
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,318
My head hurts!

126
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:28,800
(Sean sighs)

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
You want some aspirin?

128
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,868
I can't swallow.

129
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,214
Do you want those baby aspirin again?

130
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:38,047
Stay!

131
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,462
Stay.

132
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:41,295
Shh,

133
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,643
take it easy.

134
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,274
It's okay.

135
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:46,691
Don't leave me.

136
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:48,811
Dad, my daddy.

137
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:53,520
(Suzy crying)

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,370
I know, I know.

139
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,203
It's awful.

140
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,950
I remember when my father died.

141
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,593
I was crazy too.

142
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,313
Sean.

143
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,166
I missed him.

144
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:31,957
Oh my god.

145
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:36,152
(dramatic music begins)

146
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:57,068
I'm sorry Daddy, I wasn't here.

147
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,648
I'm sorry I missed your funeral.

148
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,480
I'll be a good girl, I will.

149
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,547
The door opened, and his father peered in.

150
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:05,127
"You're already dressed," he said.

151
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:05,960
"Yes," said Bertick.

152
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,970
Mom, Dad's skipping again!

153
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,187
No I'm not!

154
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,962
"Yes," said Bertick, that's not skipping.

155
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:12,833
Yes you are, right there.

156
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,464
(Sean chuckles)

157
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:17,304
Mom, can you read to us?

158
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:18,827
Sure. Hello.

159
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:19,660
Thanks, Dad.

160
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,135
You're impossible.

161
00:09:21,135 --> 00:09:22,135
Right there.

162
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,363
Okay.

163
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,379
"Stick out your tongue," said his father.

164
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:30,134
"more, more, more! Say Ah."

165
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,112
Ahhh.

166
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:35,480
"Your throat is clear, your nose is stuffed.

167
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,090
I'll make some broth," said Bertick's mother.

168
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,007
Ewwww.

169
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:41,710
Ew? Have you girls brushed your teeth?

170
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,543
I have!

171
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:43,775
No you haven't
I have.

172
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:44,608
Yes I have.
Get in there,

173
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:45,940
I'll finished the story after.
Mommy, I have too!

174
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,904
No you haven't, you get in there.

175
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,775
That big monster's gonna get you if you don't go.

176
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,141
(girls squealing)

177
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:52,770
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth.

178
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,603
Good girls.

179
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:54,436
Suzy?

180
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,990
Where'd this money come from?

181
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,090
My sock drawer.

182
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,960
Well it was on the floor.

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,810
Well, it must have slipped out.

184
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,910
I'm waitressing again.

185
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,320
Where?

186
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,603
It's only part- time.

187
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,240
Well who's taking care of the girls?

188
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,010
My mom, mostly.

189
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,340
Are you okay with that?

190
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,550
I have to be, 'til we get ahead.

191
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,719
Then maybe I can take some classes.

192
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,552
(phone ringing)
Classes?

193
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,610
What are you talking about?

194
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,200
Hello.

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,243
Ginger. Got you another date.

196
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,740
I'm sorry, what number are you calling?

197
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,373
Oh, I get it.

198
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:40,480
I get it, that guy's there huh?

199
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,630
Listen, call me back on my car phone, okay?

200
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,190
You must have the wrong number,

201
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,840
there's no one here by that name.

202
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:53,172
What kind of classes are you talking about?

203
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,523
For teaching.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,083
I wanna be a teacher.

205
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,420
For what?

206
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,633
You always hated school.

207
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,693
I want to work, okay?

208
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,032
We've got bills to pay,

209
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,980
and I don't want to have to ask my mom for money.

210
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,830
She's got problems of her own anyway.

211
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,250
Look, I'm sorry I'm not a doctor like your father was,

212
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,660
but at least give me enough respect

213
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,823
that if you get a job, to tell me about it.

214
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,490
Sean, where are you going?

215
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,790
To put the girls to bed.

216
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:32,811
(girls squealing and laughing)

217
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:43,614
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy.

218
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,467
Mommy, come out and do the new one.

219
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,445
Hold your horses.
Aww. Mom, please.

220
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:49,278
Come out.

221
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:55,333
Ready?

222
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,753
Down by the river where the green grass grows.

223
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:07,753
One, two, three, four, five.
(girls giggling)

224
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:13,545
(ominous music)

225
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,045
Come on.

226
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,780
It seems you've inherited

227
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,990
some of my brother's lawsuits.

228
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,260
Malpractice suits.

229
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,050
Yes, I just found out about it,

230
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,470
It's nothing to worry about, it happens all the time.

231
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,630
I'm going to tell your mother on Thursday.

232
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,240
Oh, it doesn't matter what you tell Martha,

233
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,093
she only believes what she wants to.

234
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,040
Well, if you need money,

235
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,350
I'm sure she'd give you a loan.

236
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,143
Loan?

237
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,750
I earned that money.

238
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,553
In what sense, Suzy?

239
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,020
I was counting on it.

240
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,690
That's what I meant.

241
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:08,414
(cars screeching)

242
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:33,578
(echoing of cars and tires screeching)

243
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:50,003
(ominous music begins)

244
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,665
Car?

245
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,498
Mommy?

246
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:59,329
Daddy?
(car alarm beeping)

247
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:00,300
Where's the car?

248
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,050
Where'd I put my car?

249
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:03,851
Car?

250
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:09,358
Bad car, bad.

251
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:14,014
Bad, where were you hiding, car?

252
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:15,514
Bad, bad, bad car.

253
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,653
Bad. Bad car.

254
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,623
Bad.

255
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:24,660
Suzy?

256
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:28,400
What?

257
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,250
You were talking about McWhorter College.

258
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,083
What about it?

259
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,640
You said you wanted to go there.

260
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,980
It's only $300 a credit.

261
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,080
What about the SATs?

262
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,333
Don't they require around 1,200?

263
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,870
Girls, please be careful over there.

264
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,760
I'll get it,

265
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,633
I'll get 1,200.

266
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,963
Maybe you shouldn't set your sights quite so high.

267
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,323
Remember all the trouble you were having in school?

268
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,263
You really don't remember?

269
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,410
Maybe that's why you don't test well.

270
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,230
Which is only one kind of intelligence,

271
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,270
but unfortunately is what school's all about.

272
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,680
Mom, I want to be a teacher.

273
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,880
I wanna help people, I wanna make things clear.

274
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,713
I understand.

275
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,050
Just because you didn't work.

276
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,600
What are you talking about?

277
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,173
I managed a restaurant from the time you were 11.

278
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,443
I swear, sometimes your brain is like Swiss cheese.

279
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,353
Here.

280
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,403
Oh, I can't take any more of your money, Mom.

281
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,980
You said you needed a loan.

282
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,533
Just now, at lunch.

283
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,110
Don't you remember?

284
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,511
Of course.

285
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,110
It's just that I...

286
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,160
I know how you feel.

287
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,023
I feel awful sometimes myself.

288
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,470
Some days since your dad is gone,

289
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
I feel like...

290
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,423
So please let me, let me help you.

291
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,011
Take this.

292
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:20,011
(cars revving)
(dogs barking)

293
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:34,116
(bar patrons chattering)

294
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:36,350
All right darling, here's the deal.

295
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,700
It's a twofer.

296
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,722
Think you're up for it?

297
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:41,050
A no in the winter?

298
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,180
Gotta make up for next week.

299
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,200
Why, where are you going?

300
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,860
This guy and his kids.
Suzy?

301
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,283
His family reunion.
Suzy?

302
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:53,250
Sorry, hun, you want something?

303
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,250
You're Suzy Tremayne.

304
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,163
English Three?

305
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,993
Or I hope so.

306
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,113
Name's Ginger.

307
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,823
Hey, your dad was a doctor, right?

308
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,050
Wasn't his name Jim Tremayne?

309
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,827
Yeah, what about him?

310
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,123
So now your name is Ginger, huh?

311
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,863
My dad knew your dad.

312
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,323
Don't know why that gonna impress me.

313
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:22,358
Well he died recently, didn't he?

314
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:23,191
Your dad?

315
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:34,320
Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude.

316
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:36,640
I really have to go.

317
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,116
Whoa, hey, Ginger.

318
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:39,064
Hey, hey, where you going?

319
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,333
Hey, settle down now.

320
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,620
I have to pick up my kids.

321
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,550
Oh, suddenly they're your kids, huh?

322
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:48,033
You know, I went to some trouble here Ginger.

323
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,933
And you're making me look bad.

324
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,413
You're embarrassing me.

325
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,740
All right, gentlemen.

326
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,010
Ginger, come here sweetheart.

327
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,893
Hey, come here.

328
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:04,414
Where the hell are you going?

329
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:07,656
Open up, open up.

330
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:08,489
Daddy no.

331
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:09,322
Daddy no, no, no.

332
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,750
Listen to your daddy.

333
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,196
Please Daddy, no.

334
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:13,562
Suzy, no.

335
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:16,395
(banging on door)

336
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,048
Ginger

337
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:21,881
Open up.

338
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,644
Open up.

339
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,106
Ginger, I need you to open up now.

340
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:34,771
(door banging gets louder)

341
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:39,148
No, no!
Hey, where you going?

342
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:42,481
Don't touch me, don't touch me!

343
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:47,832
You are really getting drifty, aren't you?

344
00:18:47,832 --> 00:18:49,205
Let's go get some coffee.

345
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:51,393
No, no coffee or tea.

346
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:55,578
All right, let the lady through.

347
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:56,790
Lady?

348
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,800
Look like a hooker to me.

349
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,550
Hey, she's all right.

350
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,580
The bigger the mouth, the smaller it is.

351
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,260
Hey, why don't we go check that out?

352
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,343
Yeah? Oh yeah?

353
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,667
(loud punch)

354
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,109
(ominous music begins)

355
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,527
Hey, Ginger!

356
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:30,186
Where you going, baby?

357
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:31,422
Come on back.

358
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:32,942
(car starts)

359
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,692
Hey Ginger!

360
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,467
Now you did it.

361
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:42,360
(ominous music intensifies)

362
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,943
(cars honking)

363
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,963
Suzy?

364
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,152
Hey Mom.

365
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:53,460
Kids give you any trouble?

366
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,403
No, I just popped by to help with dinner.

367
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,570
I meant last week.

368
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,420
Last week what?

369
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,513
Suzy, where are the children?

370
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:07,069
Oh no.

371
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:16,866
Molly, Rosie!

372
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:19,845
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

373
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,730
It's okay!

374
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,164
We made a fort.

375
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:26,231
Or, it's a castle.

376
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,660
Mom, what's for dinner?

377
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,579
Can we have macaroni?

378
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:30,412
Dinner.

379
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,990
(girls laughing)

380
00:20:38,356 --> 00:20:39,252
Can I go in the basket?

381
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:41,561
Oh, I've gotta stop, girls stay right here.

382
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:42,394
Okay.

383
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:47,555
(suspenseful music begins)

384
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,480
What is this, who got all this?

385
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,897
Mommy, you did.

386
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:07,033
I'm sorry, they won't take your card.

387
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,460
What do you mean?

388
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,583
Ginger spent it.

389
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:13,707
What?

390
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:16,455
She doesn't want us to go to school.

391
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,173
Excuse me.

392
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:23,785
Oh boy.

393
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,985
Why don't you just step in traffic and get it over with?

394
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:28,818
Shut up.

395
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:29,651
Excuse me?

396
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,550
Ma'am are you all right?

397
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,637
You're losing it Suzy.

398
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,333
You're going insane?

399
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:41,760
Where are you going?

400
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,927
Molly come on.

401
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,070
You have three hours

402
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,560
to work on the questions in this test book.

403
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,750
There are five 30-minute sections,

404
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,233
and two 15-minute sections.

405
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,180
Okay?

406
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,760
Break your seals and open the booklets.

407
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,610
Now, if you finish in the allotted time

408
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,270
you may go back and work on this section,

409
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,560
but you may not go on to any other section.

410
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,563
Is that clear?

411
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,787
Begin.

412
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:28,771
Oh gosh.

413
00:22:35,663 --> 00:22:38,080
(Suzy sighs)

414
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:46,075
Dummy.

415
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:50,817
So stupid.

416
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:04,834
(Suzy quietly mumbles to herself)

417
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,403
Sorry I'm late.

418
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,903
Honey?

419
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,853
I got promoted.

420
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,570
I mean, it still sucks,

421
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,386
but I'll be making more money and

422
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:25,282
(loud kiss)

423
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:27,223
I won't be on the loading dock anymore.

424
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,566
That's great.

425
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:32,016
And you're going to school.

426
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,530
No, I'm not gonna get into school.

427
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,685
Come on, stop that.

428
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:37,718
No, I'm not.

429
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:38,801
Look at me.

430
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:48,297
Oh, my, my, my, we're eager.

431
00:23:49,217 --> 00:23:51,717
(Sean laughs)

432
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,689
(Sean and Suzy moaning)

433
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:58,214
Oh Sean.

434
00:23:58,214 --> 00:24:03,214
Oh, Suzy.

435
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:15,939
(children laughing)

436
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,518
Sean.

437
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:49,806
Sean!

438
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:54,899
Sean?

439
00:24:58,777 --> 00:24:59,610
Sean?

440
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:01,379
Sean?

441
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,100
(suspenseful music)

442
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:28,243
Sweetie, time for dinner!

443
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:30,215
Itchy, itchy, itchy
Honey, come on!

444
00:25:30,215 --> 00:25:32,155
Get off me itchy clothes.

445
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,313
Get off.

446
00:25:33,313 --> 00:25:34,917
Didn't you hear your mom?

447
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,026
What's the matter?

448
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:37,466
Get out of here!

449
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:38,772
Get out of here!

450
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:40,934
(loud repeated punching)

451
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:44,184
(Jim groaning in pain)

452
00:25:51,903 --> 00:25:55,236
(Suzy groaning in pain)

453
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:06,542
Honey?

454
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:09,201
Suzy?

455
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:11,871
Suzy where are you?

456
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,288
I'm right here.

457
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:21,060
Hun, I thought you were packing.

458
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,962
Are you okay?

459
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:22,795
Yeah, I'm fine.

460
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:24,940
Come on, your mom's freaking out.

461
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,400
Why?

462
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,233
We're running late,

463
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,603
traffic's gonna be real bad.

464
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:38,270
(kids laughing)

465
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,010
Maybe I'll teach kindergarten.

466
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,350
I'm good with children.

467
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,243
Or maybe outro.

468
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,243
Okay.

469
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,650
Mom, I got a 710 on my math,

470
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,590
I'm getting into McWhorter.

471
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,040
Suzy, you barely finished high school.

472
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,960
There's no way-

473
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,860
All I know is I'm getting in.

474
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,030
Who's gonna watch the kids?

475
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,640
Sean.

476
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,270
How's he gonna do that?

477
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,389
I don't know,

478
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:06,780
it was good enough for you and Dad.

479
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,780
Your dad and I had money to hire help.

480
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,750
Yes, Martha.

481
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,700
And why didn't I get any of that money?

482
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,693
Suddenly I'm Martha.

483
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,870
Is something wrong with your hand?

484
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,110
I'll tell you why I didn't get the money.

485
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,800
Because his patients are suing the estate.

486
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,607
That's nonsense, who told you that?

487
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:25,860
Let me see your hand.

488
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,770
Chester did, he told me.

489
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,603
That's ridiculous.

490
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:30,163
Why would Chester lie to you?

491
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,283
Martha, what color is this frying pan?

492
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,063
What are you talking about?

493
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:36,997
The color.

494
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,903
Black.

495
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:40,923
Just checking.

496
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,233
I just thought you might think it was white.

497
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,973
Suzy.

498
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:51,516
(Jim whistling)

499
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:54,687
Back bitch.

500
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:57,444
Stop hiding it.

501
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,057
Stop it!

502
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,260
Stop!

503
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,243
Suzy, Suzy stop it
Suzy?

504
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:04,130
Martha?
Suzy, where are you going?

505
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,140
Come back here.

506
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,533
Sean, Sean help her.

507
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:10,986
(suspenseful music begins)

508
00:28:10,986 --> 00:28:12,157
Chicken.

509
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,112
Chicken.

510
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:13,945
Chicken.

511
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:21,722
(Suzy breathing heavily)

512
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:24,030
Stupid.

513
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,863
Stupid.

514
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:27,656
Suzy!

515
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:33,013
Let me go!

516
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:35,607
Let me.

517
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:37,762
Let go!

518
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:38,595
No!

519
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,285
(Suzy grunting)

520
00:28:44,995 --> 00:28:46,486
Suzy!

521
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:47,319
Suzy.

522
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,649
Suzy.

523
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:00,575
Suzy.

524
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:03,956
Okay.

525
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,375
Come on, go, go.

526
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:10,323
Honey?

527
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:13,219
Suzy?

528
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:15,301
Suzy?

529
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:16,968
I wanna go around.

530
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,445
(Suzy crying)
Honey.

531
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:27,741
Honey, it's okay.

532
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:28,574
Suzy?

533
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:30,736
Honey?

534
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:32,643
Honey, it's just me.
(Suzy shrieks)

535
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:33,857
It's okay, it's okay.

536
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,107
It's all right.

537
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,117
Sh, it's okay.

538
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:48,497
And what do these voices say?

539
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,967
Well, some are telling me to die.

540
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:56,853
And some are telling me to live.

541
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:00,368
When does this happen?

542
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:01,868
When you're tired?

543
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:03,608
Yeah.

544
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,390
She's worried about the children.

545
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,640
I imagine so.

546
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,483
Wake up, Chester.

547
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,763
We need a psychiatrist.

548
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,030
You mean, for the family.

549
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,110
A family therapist.

550
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,303
Is that what I mean?

551
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,560
Well, I think that'd be best.

552
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,253
It's not free,

553
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,610
but maybe your mother will help out.

554
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,130
I'll make some calls.

555
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,330
In the meantime,

556
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,093
I want you to take this for depression,

557
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,980
and this

558
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,590
to help prevent the panic.

559
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:46,874
(Suzy mumbling)

560
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,663
Sometimes I feel like different people.

561
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,393
I understand.

562
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Some days you're up.

563
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,400
Some days you're down.

564
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,900
The bigger the silverware, the closer to the plate,

565
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,604
and napkins on your right.

566
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:14,794
This is a dirty spoon,

567
00:31:14,794 --> 00:31:16,492
maybe I should wash it.
Hey!

568
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:17,843
Daddy's home!

569
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,322
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

570
00:31:19,322 --> 00:31:20,155
Hey you!

571
00:31:21,703 --> 00:31:23,275
Hey girls, how you doing?

572
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:24,108
Good.

573
00:31:26,138 --> 00:31:27,259
(quiet thud)

574
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:29,570
Hey, be careful sweetie.
Be careful.

575
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,340
(Sean chuckles)

576
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,882
So did you fill the prescription?

577
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:35,076
Mhmm.

578
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:35,909
Yeah, the pills working?

579
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:37,722
On me they are.

580
00:31:37,722 --> 00:31:38,857
Huh?

581
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,520
I'm a happy zombie.

582
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,353
Oh.

583
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,453
You smell good.

584
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:46,201
You smell like a

585
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:47,034
(loud kissing)

586
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:48,439
raw onion.

587
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,272
(Sean grunts)

588
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:51,280
Hey, what was that for?

589
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,520
Come on.

590
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,917
Gimme your hands you little brats.

591
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:56,128
It's time to wash your hands.
(girls crying)

592
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:57,050
Don't talk to the girls like that.

593
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,220
What's wrong with you?

594
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,320
You wash your hands.

595
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,230
It's no use Pigeon.

596
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,433
Nobody gets it.

597
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,251
(door slams)

598
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:15,668
(Suzy breathing heavily)

599
00:32:24,468 --> 00:32:27,135
(ominous music)

600
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,142
Now just sit down.

601
00:32:29,142 --> 00:32:30,892
Sit down, I'll be right back, okay?

602
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,930
Yeah, get some bread.

603
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:41,203
(Suzy shouting)

604
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:48,704
(rapid knocking at door)

605
00:32:48,704 --> 00:32:49,870
What's going on?

606
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,870
She won't talk to me.

607
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,964
She's scared to death of me.

608
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:54,797
Has this ever happened before?

609
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:57,623
Yeah, but I've always been able to snap her out of it.

610
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:09,553
(Suzy calmly typing)
Suzy?

611
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,020
Suzy, it's Chester.

612
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,300
What are you working on?

613
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,350
My college application.

614
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,100
I'm taking 12 credits at McWhorter.

615
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,400
Didn't Suzy tell you?

616
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:23,505
No.

617
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,993
Suzy didn't tell me.

618
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,940
Well that's probably because Suzy doesn't know.

619
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,230
You see what I mean?

620
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,058
You understand, don't you Chester?

621
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:36,891
No,

622
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,883
I'm sorry I don't.

623
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:42,660
Then please,

624
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,163
help us find someone who does.

625
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,370
We're here to see Dr. Mullins.

626
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,610
Certainly.

627
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,847
I'll be in a room and I'll wonder,

628
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,370
"what am I doing here?

629
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,357
What did I come in here for?"

630
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,280
Have you been drinking more lately?

631
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,380
No, I can't stand the taste of alcohol.

632
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,633
Then how do you account for the blackouts?

633
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,199
Well, I don't take drugs,

634
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,253
so maybe it's because I've been so stressed out lately.

635
00:34:14,146 --> 00:34:16,719
[Female Therapist] And your cat scan was normal.

636
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,500
So when you're stressed,

637
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,533
is that when you start to talk to yourself?

638
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,453
Never out loud.

639
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,300
But how would you know, if you're losing whole days?

640
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,409
It's hard to say.

641
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:36,533
What did the other doctors have to say?

642
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:38,893
The other doctors.

643
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,623
I mean, how many doctors have you seen so far?

644
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,587
Um, two, three, four?

645
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,750
You don't remember.

646
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,283
I,

647
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,633
I thought that's why I was sent to you.

648
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,330
Your specialty is amnesia.

649
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,230
In a way, in a way.

650
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,600
Actually, my specialty is dissociative disorders,

651
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,763
in which memory loss is one of the symptoms.

652
00:35:12,784 --> 00:35:13,770
Dissociative.

653
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,880
No, it doesn't matter, it's just a term.

654
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,610
What's more important is this memory loss.

655
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,460
Now how long has this been happening?

656
00:35:26,712 --> 00:35:27,545
Um.

657
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:29,040
No, it's okay.

658
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,033
Can you tell me your earliest memory?

659
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,353
Um.

660
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,590
Oh, god.

661
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,360
I'm sorry, is there someplace you have to be?

662
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,193
My children.

663
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,890
I have to leave here by four to pick them up.

664
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,810
My mom's watching them.

665
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,023
Mrs. Mitchell,

666
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,023
do you remember what you told me on the phone?

667
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,063
About my mom?

668
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,510
Is that what you want me to do, talk about my mom?

669
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,988
Well sure, if that's what you want to talk about.

670
00:35:59,988 --> 00:36:03,743
Because, I really can't afford this.

671
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,703
Money's very tight right now.

672
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:10,980
I don't know where it all goes, I'm just,

673
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,513
I'm terrible with money.

674
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,470
It's probably my biggest problem in life.

675
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,530
Other than the voices?

676
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,610
They're not really voices,

677
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,393
it's just me talking to myself.

678
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:34,490
You know, the way everybody does.

679
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,323
Okay.

680
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,333
I see.

681
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,230
Let's go back to the money, all right?

682
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,380
Who's been spending it?

683
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
We don't have any money.

684
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,140
We can't pay for this.

685
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,660
That's all there is to it.

686
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,493
We?

687
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,500
Me and Sean.

688
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,850
What did you think I meant?

689
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,124
I'm sorry, I really have to go.

690
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:04,957
Now Mrs. Mitchell-

691
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:07,063
I don't have a very good memory.

692
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,230
Coming home from the hospital with Molly.

693
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:13,970
She's nine years old,

694
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,450
that's as far back as I can remember, okay?

695
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,290
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry if that sounds weird to you.

696
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,887
No, no.

697
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:22,590
That doesn't sound weird to me.

698
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,330
Why don't we sit down and we can work this out.

699
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,033
No, I'm late. Sorry.

700
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,370
You've been very kind.

701
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:32,071
Thank you.

702
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:44,250
He's not even a medical doctor.

703
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,811
Suzy, what did he tell you?

704
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:47,540
Nothing, he thinks I'm a freak.

705
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,900
He's trying to put ideas in my head.

706
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,733
Come on honey,

707
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,370
that sounds a little crazy to me.

708
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,910
See, you think I'm a nut, too.

709
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,640
Sean please, I'm tired,

710
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,943
and I've been from one doctor to another.

711
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,960
It's helped, it really has.

712
00:38:05,397 --> 00:38:07,550
I just want to get back to my life.

713
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,507
Why are you looking at me like that?

714
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:17,562
Suzy's great with the girls.

715
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,120
I mean, they're great kids,

716
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,700
They're strong, they love her.

717
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,763
I mean, there's no better mother on Earth.

718
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,540
Go on.

719
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,613
Well, you know,

720
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,713
sometimes she goes into these modes.

721
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,780
You do, you just don't realize it.

722
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,570
What kind of modes?

723
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,910
Well, there's the little girl mode,

724
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,560
when she doesn't want to know me.

725
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,240
Then lately, if

726
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,300
I even try to touch her,

727
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,300
she goes into this butch routine.

728
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,229
(Suzy gasps)

729
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:57,450
I do not!

730
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,650
That's not true.

731
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,483
What do you call it?

732
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:01,160
You're awful to me, you treat me like-

733
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,250
I understand.

734
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,300
Well she does.

735
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Stop this, please.

736
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:07,990
(Sean sighs)

737
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,700
Tell me about when the two of you first met.

738
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,353
Suzy was working at a bar,

739
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,033
dancing.

740
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:18,830
Y'know, nothing that raunchy,

741
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,963
just kind of bikini dancing.

742
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,840
Can you believe it, this shy thing?

743
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,020
So when did things begin to change?

744
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,500
When Molly was born,

745
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,443
our oldest girl.

746
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,913
It sort of spelled the end of the party girl.

747
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,550
Did it Suzy?

748
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,047
No, for me everything was fine.

749
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,871
That's not true.

750
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:44,421
It's like you just disappeared,

751
00:39:46,565 --> 00:39:48,820
and we didn't have sex for months.

752
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,540
Do you recall that Suzy?

753
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,373
No.

754
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:52,220
She's lying. Why are you doing this?

755
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,270
He's trying to help us.

756
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,450
You don't remember, do you?

757
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,283
No.

758
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:56,830
Stop fighting this, damn it.

759
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,573
You stop fighting it.

760
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,573
And you step back.

761
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,683
Hi, how are you.

762
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:10,450
(Suzy sighs)

763
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,693
How do you think I am?

764
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:14,780
I don't know.

765
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,883
Fed up, already, with both of you.

766
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,490
Okay, that's fair.

767
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,493
Don't give me that flossy crap.

768
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:26,420
Didn't I tell you he wasn't straight up?

769
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,263
Yeah, sort of.

770
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:30,197
But at least you're being honest now.

771
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,940
Cut the crap, what do you want?

772
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,613
Whatever you wanna tell me.

773
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:40,740
Here we go again with your lame ass questions.

774
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,353
Okay, okay.

775
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,653
Do you spend Suzy's money.

776
00:40:46,805 --> 00:40:49,120
Don't put Ginger's moves on me.

777
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,953
Ginger.

778
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,053
Who's Ginger?

779
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:58,164
Damn it, damn it,

780
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,184
you stupid slut.

781
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:01,934
Stupid, stupid, dumb.

782
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:08,020
(Suzy quietly mumbling)

783
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,023
She does this sometimes.

784
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,003
Suzy.

785
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,653
Suzy, honey.

786
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,893
Suzy.

787
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,393
Did you hear any of that?

788
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,453
Sean.

789
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,650
I know things have been kind of weird lately,

790
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,890
but your mom, she's been going through something.

791
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,230
You know, I get upset with her,

792
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,720
and then she forgets to do some things,

793
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,490
like picking you up at school.

794
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,970
Dad, it's okay.

795
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,093
No, it's not okay.

796
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,660
It's gotta be pretty scary.

797
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,420
Now your mom and I, we're trying to deal with it.

798
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,740
Sometimes your mom's your mom,

799
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,993
and then sometimes she's like somebody else,

800
00:42:15,844 --> 00:42:19,270
and every since Grandpa died, it's starting to get worse.

801
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,403
We know Dad.

802
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,810
No, you see, it's more complicated than that.

803
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,870
It's not like sometimes she's happy, sometimes she's sad.

804
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,340
It's more complicated than that.

805
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,983
Daddy, we know.

806
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,740
How do you know?

807
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,703
Can we still play with Bonnie?

808
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:43,580
Who's Bonnie?

809
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,153
The one who likes to play.

810
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,983
Why is Bonnie lying in the corner?

811
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:53,200
To sleep.

812
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,033
Why?

813
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:59,610
'Cause, she's gonna have to leave.

814
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,423
Well, she's gonna come back.

815
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,260
No. Never.

816
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,093
Why not?

817
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:14,692
'Cause everybody's fighting about money.

818
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:18,770
Well fighting about money isn't good,

819
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,970
why are they doing that?

820
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:24,875
(Suzy breathes heavily)

821
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:32,981
Because your prices are high as hell you idiot.

822
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,700
Well hello again.

823
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,340
Yes I'm afraid I do have to make a living,

824
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,510
but didn't Sean say something about

825
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,953
you getting some financial help from your mother?

826
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,020
What do I look like, an accountant?

827
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,813
Well who does the books?

828
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,800
And who's the math whizz?

829
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,893
Who got a 650 on her boards?

830
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:04,579
A 720.

831
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,360
And the money, for your information,

832
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,210
is tied up in malpractice suits,

833
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:15,120
which I happen to be in the process of investigating.

834
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,650
I see.

835
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,110
Oh, I'm Eric by the way.

836
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:19,943
Who are you?

837
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,593
Me.

838
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,500
Well it's nice to meet you Me.

839
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,560
You know, I think you could be very helpful to us.

840
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,993
Which would be a triumph for you Dr. Scanlon.

841
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,510
A victory for Prince Scanlon,

842
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,903
scandled for the lean clean beautiful queen.

843
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,893
Victoria's my name.

844
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:46,323
What's your lame brain saying game?

845
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,020
That's a very difficult game Victoria,

846
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,270
I'm not gonna lie to you.

847
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,930
Our process is, we work together

848
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,620
to begin to talk to each other,

849
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,632
so that we can finally blend and become one.

850
00:44:57,632 --> 00:44:59,240
(Suzy sighs)

851
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,463
You want us to ask our mother for money.

852
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,380
I'm warning you, Ginger will never countenance that.

853
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,230
Why not?

854
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,209
Because that's her policy.

855
00:45:12,452 --> 00:45:15,483
Well could you explain that to me?

856
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:19,010
Oh please, Eric.

857
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,870
Don't be disingenuous.

858
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,430
I'm sure you've read the same texts we have.

859
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,440
Of all recorded cases of multiple personality,

860
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,070
fewer than 5% have failed to demonstrate

861
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,993
an etiology of repeated traumatic abuse.

862
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,050
That's very good.

863
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,210
Are you saying that your mother abused you?

864
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,660
You're saying that.

865
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,110
You don't remember, do you?

866
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,770
Well what about Ginger?

867
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,713
Does she remember?

868
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:55,503
(Suzy chuckles)

869
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:58,717
Well.

870
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,030
Ginger won't talk to you.

871
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,880
Why not?

872
00:46:06,283 --> 00:46:09,533
(Suzy speaking French)

873
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:11,729
Well what about Bonnie?

874
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,453
Bonnie?

875
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,153
Do you wanna come out and play again?

876
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,430
Of course, we could always forget to pay you,

877
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,263
couldn't we?

878
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,323
It's another alternative.

879
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,073
Bonnie?

880
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:31,923
Hi.

881
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,113
It's me, Eric.

882
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,500
Bonnie, what do you see?

883
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,283
Who am I?

884
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,543
Suzy.

885
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,483
I need to talk to Suzy now.

886
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,093
Suzy!

887
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,040
Why are you doing this?

888
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,580
Because sweetheart,

889
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,690
between therapy and chauffeuring the kids,

890
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,290
you can't be everywhere at once.

891
00:47:19,056 --> 00:47:19,956
Are you all right?

892
00:47:21,063 --> 00:47:21,896
Yeah.

893
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,767
Listen, why don't you go lie down,

894
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:28,767
and I'll make sure that Sean and the girls get their dinner.

895
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,503
Incidentally, I sent a check to your therapist directly.

896
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,550
Are you sure you're okay with that?

897
00:47:42,504 --> 00:47:43,504
Of course.

898
00:47:44,536 --> 00:47:47,710
It makes me feel useful now that your dad is gone.

899
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,810
How's your therapy coming by the way?

900
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,013
I don't know.

901
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,790
I guess I'm finding out some stuff.

902
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,263
Well, so long as it doesn't become a crutch.

903
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,673
Thanks, Mom.

904
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,710
(door slams)

905
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:09,643
Lying bitch!

906
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:16,657
(Suzy breathing heavily)
(ominous music)

907
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:19,157
Think you can hide it from me?

908
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:28,398
(cars rushing by)

909
00:48:29,437 --> 00:48:30,270
Hey!

910
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:35,974
Come on!

911
00:48:35,974 --> 00:48:38,891
(glass shattering)

912
00:48:41,331 --> 00:48:44,164
(window thudding)

913
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:46,416
Okay, Mom.

914
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:52,244
Let's see.

915
00:48:59,408 --> 00:49:00,830
Where'd she put it.

916
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,130
Where'd you hide it Mommy?

917
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,943
Oh, Daddy's office?

918
00:49:08,601 --> 00:49:09,434
Clever.

919
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:18,080
(Suzy gasps)

920
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,959
Didn't even open these.

921
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:22,709
(papers falling)

922
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,823
Claimant, Natalie Adams.

923
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:52,311
(loud thud)

924
00:49:52,311 --> 00:49:55,532
(dogs barking)

925
00:49:55,532 --> 00:49:58,282
(metal scraping)

926
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:02,976
(ominous music intensifies)

927
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:08,756
(dogs continue barking)

928
00:50:35,304 --> 00:50:37,721
(Suzy gasps)

929
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:54,781
That'll teach you, Natalie Adams.

930
00:50:54,781 --> 00:50:56,293
(phone ringing)
Honey, get the phone.

931
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,767
Ginger, I don't know about phone tag.

932
00:51:13,426 --> 00:51:15,203
I gotta get out of here.

933
00:51:15,203 --> 00:51:16,036
Good,

934
00:51:16,036 --> 00:51:18,610
'cause I need you to make another run to San Diego for me.

935
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,523
Trevor again? How much?

936
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,820
How much do you need?

937
00:51:24,232 --> 00:51:27,127
Hm. Enough for a ticket to Hawaii.

938
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,763
I'm serious hun, I'm going nuts.

939
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:34,513
Yeah, you never did strike me as much of a homebody.

940
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:40,129
Does this mean I'm gonna lose my best girl?

941
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:42,060
(Suzy chuckles)

942
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,410
You're breaking my heart.

943
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,050
You're not gonna flake out on me again, are you?

944
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,820
No, no way.

945
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,423
This has gotta work on Dad.

946
00:51:55,004 --> 00:51:56,453
See ya in an hour!

947
00:51:56,453 --> 00:51:58,570
Bye! I'll miss you!

948
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,624
See you tonight!

949
00:52:00,624 --> 00:52:01,897
I love you, I'll miss you!

950
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:05,730
Come on, come on, let's get inside.

951
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,393
Hi there, can I help you?

952
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,920
Yes please, can I see that there?

953
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,333
That's a pretty gun.

954
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:17,563
This one?

955
00:52:17,563 --> 00:52:19,671
Yeah, that one there.

956
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:21,162
All right.

957
00:52:21,162 --> 00:52:22,745
Thank you mister.

958
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,750
Let's go home.

959
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,963
Let's stop this.

960
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:49,883
Well, let's just see.

961
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,983
(loud country music)

962
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:59,233
(bar patrons chatting)

963
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:09,848
How you doing, precious?

964
00:53:09,848 --> 00:53:11,015
How you doing.

965
00:53:12,205 --> 00:53:13,342
Wanna get something to eat?

966
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:14,175
Oh sure.

967
00:53:17,323 --> 00:53:18,789
(Suzy laughs)

968
00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:20,660
Hey, baby, how about a dance.

969
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,129
How 'bout a sandwich.

970
00:53:22,129 --> 00:53:24,379
How about a little later.

971
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,250
Hey stranger.

972
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,640
Hey.

973
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,740
You working tonight?

974
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,728
No, I'm just looking for Trevor.

975
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:37,800
He's around

976
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,796
I don't know where he could be.

977
00:53:39,796 --> 00:53:40,629
So.

978
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,303
How are your kids?

979
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:45,283
Fine.

980
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,570
How's your old man?

981
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,863
He died.

982
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,210
That's awful.

983
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,053
I'm sorry.

984
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,510
That's gotta be really tough on your kids, huh?

985
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:04,367
Oh.

986
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,420
I thought you were talking about my father,

987
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:12,170
no, no my boyfriend, he's still alive.

988
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,370
He's watching the girls.

989
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,290
Any more at home like him?

990
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,190
Hey, precious.

991
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,323
You wanna go again?

992
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:23,623
She's with me.

993
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,993
Oh.

994
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,304
Oh, I get it.

995
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,643
Good.

996
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,023
Good, now go on, take it somewhere else.

997
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:42,343
Um, gotta get ready for my set.

998
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,673
Do you maybe wanna go get some dinner later?

999
00:54:49,722 --> 00:54:51,687
Oh, yeah, maybe.

1000
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:55,473
I don't know if I'll have time.

1001
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,813
Bye.

1002
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:03,503
Hey precious.

1003
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:06,593
Can um, can I watch?

1004
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,100
Watch what?

1005
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,030
You and your friend.

1006
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,223
Hey Ginger.

1007
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,970
Hello Mr. Trevor.

1008
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:17,803
What, are you stoned?

1009
00:55:17,803 --> 00:55:19,240
Hey, I've got money.

1010
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,290
Excuse me a second.

1011
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,230
Hold up, come on.

1012
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,570
So you got it?

1013
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,512
Got what?

1014
00:55:29,512 --> 00:55:30,460
My product.

1015
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,293
Oh.

1016
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,293
It's safe.

1017
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:35,933
Wait a minute, hey,

1018
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:36,766
what the hell does that mean?

1019
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:37,599
Don't you get it?

1020
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,432
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

1021
00:55:38,432 --> 00:55:39,570
Look, just stay out of this.

1022
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,880
No you stay out of this.

1023
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,546
Hey, stop it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1024
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:44,519
Settle down boys.
Stop, stop fighting!

1025
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:49,186
(loud punching)
No, don't hurt that man!

1026
00:55:50,249 --> 00:55:51,082
Ow!

1027
00:55:54,058 --> 00:55:54,990
Where the hell is it?

1028
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:56,044
Where's my money.

1029
00:55:56,044 --> 00:55:57,081
(Trevor breathing heavily)

1030
00:55:57,081 --> 00:55:58,870
All right, look.

1031
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,363
Just give me whatever you've got-

1032
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,883
Good Ginger, you crazy bitch.

1033
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:10,704
We're out of here.

1034
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:13,454
(loud bar music)

1035
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,383
Hey, come back.

1036
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,370
You don't wanna mess with me,

1037
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,203
take my word for that.

1038
00:56:25,203 --> 00:56:27,156
But, I love you.

1039
00:56:27,156 --> 00:56:31,157
(loud kick)
(man groans in pain)

1040
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:34,074
(tires screeching)

1041
00:56:42,938 --> 00:56:45,771
(loud rock music)

1042
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:33,089
(car door slamming)

1043
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:42,563
(phone ringing)
Suzy?

1044
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:43,396
D.J.

1045
00:57:43,396 --> 00:57:45,164
Where's Suzy, I wanna talk to Suzy.

1046
00:57:45,164 --> 00:57:46,190
I have too much to deal with right now.

1047
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,023
Hello.

1048
00:57:47,023 --> 00:57:48,880
Sean, I think we gotta call the police.

1049
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,920
This isn't Sean, it's D.J.

1050
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,310
Oh, I must've dialed the wrong number,

1051
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,430
I'm terribly sorry.

1052
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,803
Suzy, where were you tonight?

1053
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:55,673
I had to lie to your mom,

1054
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,850
I had to lie to the kids.

1055
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,184
Yeah, it hurts doesn't it?

1056
00:57:58,184 --> 00:57:59,260
Just don't make me lie to you.

1057
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,093
I wanna talk to the woman I married.

1058
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:01,020
She's not here!

1059
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,712
The bitch almost got us all killed.

1060
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,291
Suzy, what in the hell's going on here?

1061
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,564
Are you deaf?
Suzy!

1062
00:58:05,564 --> 00:58:06,916
(door slams)

1063
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:07,749
Suzy!

1064
00:58:07,749 --> 00:58:09,109
Hello? Hello?

1065
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:10,310
What's going on, is somebody there?

1066
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,890
Hello?

1067
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,440
Yeah, I'm calling for Ginger.

1068
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,440
Didn't work out, the deal's off.

1069
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,263
Who's this?

1070
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,543
A friend of Ginger's.

1071
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,380
She's through with you.

1072
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:28,580
You listen to me, whoever you are.

1073
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,960
You tell her that I want back what belongs to me.

1074
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,560
Otherwise she's gonna disappear.

1075
00:58:34,404 --> 00:58:35,904
You tell her that.

1076
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:38,000
Hello?

1077
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,904
You understand that?

1078
00:58:38,904 --> 00:58:40,956
Hello? Hello?
Suzy.

1079
00:58:40,956 --> 00:58:42,158
Who the hell's Suzy?
Suzy.

1080
00:58:42,158 --> 00:58:45,158
What's goin on here?
Suzy

1081
00:58:47,012 --> 00:58:49,679
(phone dialing)

1082
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,866
Hey Martha, I don't know what's going on.

1083
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,327
I need you to watch the girls.

1084
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:57,244
(tires screeching)

1085
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:03,283
(dramatic music plays)

1086
00:59:05,982 --> 00:59:06,815
Hey hun.

1087
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,438
Hey, Ginger-

1088
00:59:10,438 --> 00:59:13,021
(dogs barking)

1089
00:59:18,109 --> 00:59:20,526
(door slams)

1090
00:59:34,932 --> 00:59:36,044
(Suzy knocking on door)

1091
00:59:36,044 --> 00:59:37,432
Hello?

1092
00:59:37,432 --> 00:59:38,432
Dr. Scanlon?

1093
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:40,223
Eric.

1094
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,033
Dr. Scanlon.

1095
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:44,101
Hello?

1096
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,590
Suzy?

1097
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,580
Don't you move, don't you move.

1098
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,413
You stay there.

1099
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:53,163
Sit down Eric.

1100
00:59:53,163 --> 00:59:53,996
Okay.

1101
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,163
We haven't met, I'm Ginger.

1102
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,257
What's going on?

1103
01:00:02,257 --> 01:00:03,680
Nothing much,

1104
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,853
just took us a little trip to San Diego.

1105
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,580
Any particular reason?

1106
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,190
Money.

1107
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,779
Well what about money?

1108
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:14,690
Oh, I had to make some.

1109
01:00:16,368 --> 01:00:18,060
And how did you do that?

1110
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,283
The old-fashioned way.

1111
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:21,810
With a gun.

1112
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,113
With this.

1113
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:28,953
I see.

1114
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,230
How long you been doing that?

1115
01:00:37,076 --> 01:00:37,909
Forever.

1116
01:00:40,943 --> 01:00:42,560
Don't you tell Suzy.

1117
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,710
All that girl knows is how to fold laundry.

1118
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,190
She didn't even exist before those kids.

1119
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:51,180
We created her, not the other way around, okay?

1120
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,013
Okay.

1121
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,690
Just ask Suzy what she remembers before her kids.

1122
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,623
Well, I know what she remembers.

1123
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:02,837
And that's the way it's gonna stay, hm?

1124
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:05,510
You know, I think you'd be really surprised

1125
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,810
at how much Suzy is finding out about herself.

1126
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:10,483
Tell me about it.

1127
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:13,780
She's totally freaking out.

1128
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,133
You just lay off, or we'll all be history.

1129
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,040
What are those burns on your arm?

1130
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:31,751
I don't know.

1131
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,893
Well, who does?

1132
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:40,565
No, you stay back.

1133
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,850
You think you know about our history?

1134
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,882
You think we were molested?

1135
01:01:46,882 --> 01:01:49,382
(frantic knocking at door)
That's a load of crap!

1136
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,660
I was always in control.

1137
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,822
Is anybody in here?
Always!

1138
01:01:53,822 --> 01:01:54,655
Suzy?

1139
01:01:54,655 --> 01:01:55,560
You stay back.

1140
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,240
Sean, please.

1141
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,073
Stay back.

1142
01:01:58,073 --> 01:01:59,113
Stay back!

1143
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,792
It's okay.

1144
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:05,813
Stay there.

1145
01:02:05,813 --> 01:02:06,730
Stay there.

1146
01:02:08,924 --> 01:02:11,424
(Suzy crying)

1147
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:18,217
Honey, it's okay.
No, Don't!

1148
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:20,217
It's okay, shh.

1149
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:24,907
You're hurting me, Ow!
It's okay, it's okay.

1150
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,657
It's okay, it's okay.

1151
01:02:27,856 --> 01:02:28,689
Shh.

1152
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,665
Hey.

1153
01:02:44,665 --> 01:02:45,498
Hey!

1154
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,383
Suzy?

1155
01:03:02,267 --> 01:03:03,100
You okay?

1156
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,647
What am I doing here?

1157
01:03:08,762 --> 01:03:10,003
You had a crisis.

1158
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:15,963
Great.

1159
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,070
You don't remember?

1160
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:22,102
No.

1161
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:26,243
You were-

1162
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,410
there was this guy at a bar,

1163
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:32,017
and you threw a package to him.

1164
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:36,160
Then when I got to Eric's office,

1165
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,310
you were holding a gun.

1166
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,978
I don't remember.

1167
01:03:42,978 --> 01:03:45,210
Well when are you going to remember, damn it.

1168
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,990
When you got a whole secret life going here,

1169
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,053
all these firearms and guys and bars.

1170
01:03:53,606 --> 01:03:56,134
Sorry.

1171
01:03:56,134 --> 01:03:56,967
I'm sorry,

1172
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,743
I'm going a little crazy here myself.

1173
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:11,510
How are the girls?

1174
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,163
They're fine.

1175
01:04:19,317 --> 01:04:22,437
They asked me to give you these.

1176
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:35,763
Oh god.

1177
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:41,265
(Suzy starts crying)

1178
01:04:41,265 --> 01:04:42,182
I'm a mess.

1179
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:48,590
Well you look better.

1180
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,963
Finally got some sleep.

1181
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,053
My work's been kinda nocturnal.

1182
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,653
Well how did you get into your line of work?

1183
01:05:00,884 --> 01:05:02,500
(Suzy chuckles)

1184
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,694
My line of work?

1185
01:05:03,694 --> 01:05:04,920
Mm hmm.

1186
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,750
Oh come on Eric, you can say it out loud.

1187
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,143
I'm a prostitute.

1188
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:11,320
A hooker.

1189
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,750
A beat girl.

1190
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,430
Street meat.

1191
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,560
Ho.

1192
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,210
Pro.

1193
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:18,750
Strawberry.

1194
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,450
Back-Alley Sally.

1195
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,283
Ginger.

1196
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:25,340
What do you like when it's time to charge up?

1197
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:29,630
What makes you hot and horny and freaky?

1198
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,940
Out with it boy, what gets you off?

1199
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:32,773
Suzy.

1200
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,750
Did you hear any of that?

1201
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:41,663
No.

1202
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,940
Suzy, what did you hear?

1203
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:46,809
I don't know.

1204
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:50,279
Do you think Ginger was lying?

1205
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:52,663
Yes.

1206
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,428
No.

1207
01:05:55,428 --> 01:05:56,511
I don't know.

1208
01:05:58,863 --> 01:06:00,100
I don't know what to do.

1209
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,743
This is important Suzy.

1210
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,923
You just heard somebody else.

1211
01:06:08,241 --> 01:06:09,074
Oh my god.

1212
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,279
Does Sean know?

1213
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,040
Well he's starting to.

1214
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,860
He already asked me about the gun,

1215
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:21,070
and about some guy that you threw a package to.

1216
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,598
No, don't tell him.

1217
01:06:22,598 --> 01:06:24,298
You can't tell him, he can't know.

1218
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:28,560
My life, my life.

1219
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:32,083
He'll leave me, he'll take my kids.

1220
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:33,987
He'll kill me. He'll kill me.

1221
01:06:33,987 --> 01:06:36,404
He'll kill me. He'll kill me.

1222
01:06:50,419 --> 01:06:53,560
(girls shouting in excitement)

1223
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,784
There you are, my babies.

1224
01:06:55,784 --> 01:06:56,912
(loud kissing)

1225
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:57,745
Molly.

1226
01:06:59,242 --> 01:07:00,884
Here they are!

1227
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:03,478
Welcome home there, Mommy's home.

1228
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:05,019
We ate oatmeal for breakfast,

1229
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:07,269
and we cleaned up our room.

1230
01:07:10,185 --> 01:07:12,800
We also made a surprise for you.

1231
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,232
It's a picture of you, see?

1232
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:16,566
(sad slow music)
Oh, it's beautiful.

1233
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:17,731
Tell me about it.

1234
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:18,886
It's a picture of you.

1235
01:07:18,886 --> 01:07:19,983
We have an artist here.
Welcome home sweetheart,

1236
01:07:19,983 --> 01:07:21,675
welcome home.

1237
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:24,508
Welcome home sweetheart.
Hey mom.

1238
01:07:26,064 --> 01:07:27,396
Thanks for helping me out.

1239
01:07:27,396 --> 01:07:28,904
It's great to have you back sweetie.

1240
01:07:28,904 --> 01:07:30,970
It's great to be back.

1241
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,128
Can we play with Bonnie?

1242
01:07:32,128 --> 01:07:32,961
Oh, not right now.

1243
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:34,264
Please, I wanna play with Bonnie.

1244
01:07:34,264 --> 01:07:35,701
Bonnie's not feeling very well.

1245
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:38,393
Please, I wanna play with Bonnie, please please.

1246
01:07:38,393 --> 01:07:40,060
Where's Bonnie gone?

1247
01:07:42,573 --> 01:07:44,360
Come on Suzy, deal with it.

1248
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,506
Why? Nobody else is.

1249
01:07:46,506 --> 01:07:49,589
They're afraid of the truth, are you?

1250
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:53,279
Okay, where'd you put it.

1251
01:07:55,725 --> 01:07:56,558
Cold.

1252
01:07:58,522 --> 01:07:59,355
Cold.

1253
01:08:02,002 --> 01:08:04,669
(ominous music)

1254
01:08:08,622 --> 01:08:11,622
(drawers shuffling)

1255
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:19,413
Warmer.

1256
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:23,206
Warmer.

1257
01:08:26,555 --> 01:08:27,389
Come on.

1258
01:08:30,163 --> 01:08:30,996
Warmer.

1259
01:08:33,955 --> 01:08:36,455
(Suzy grunts)

1260
01:08:37,691 --> 01:08:39,109
Oh.

1261
01:08:39,109 --> 01:08:39,942
Come on.

1262
01:08:45,559 --> 01:08:48,542
Daddy barbecued it, now you rescued it.

1263
01:08:49,544 --> 01:08:51,359
(Suzy laughing)

1264
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,670
Claimant.

1265
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,330
Natalie Adams, you little tattletale.

1266
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,792
Tattely Natalie Adams.

1267
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,372
Come on, Suzy, it's now or never.

1268
01:09:10,618 --> 01:09:13,368
(car door slams)

1269
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:36,191
(rapid knocking at door)

1270
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,212
Yes?

1271
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:42,323
Can I help you?

1272
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,223
Are you Natalie Adams?

1273
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,082
Yes.

1274
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:51,090
I'm Suzy Tremayne.

1275
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,690
Dr. Tremayne's daughter, please.

1276
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,290
Look, I'm not supposed to talk about the case

1277
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,960
with anyone, okay?

1278
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,853
Please help me.

1279
01:09:59,115 --> 01:10:00,465
I've gotta talk to someone.

1280
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:02,670
Just tell me one thing.

1281
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,383
One thing, I'll go away, please.

1282
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,163
I don't care about the money.

1283
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,647
I probably shouldn't have come.

1284
01:10:20,647 --> 01:10:22,740
No, you probably shouldn't have.

1285
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,110
Sorry.

1286
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:24,980
Yes, I'm sure you are.

1287
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,600
Would you like some tea?

1288
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,750
No, thank you.

1289
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:31,863
So what do you wanna hear about?

1290
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,870
The time I woke up in his office

1291
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,643
with my panties around my ankles?

1292
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,363
Or the time he climbed onto the examining table.

1293
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,530
Or the nightmares, maybe you'd like to hear about those.

1294
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,140
Or the injections he gave me.

1295
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,583
And asking me to come back again and again.

1296
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,133
And I went.

1297
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,930
What did I know?

1298
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:55,293
I was just a kid, right?

1299
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:58,100
He said if I didn't,

1300
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,630
he had friends who could find me anyway.

1301
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,123
He said that he had eyes in the back of his head.

1302
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:07,160
Thank you, thank you very much.

1303
01:11:08,507 --> 01:11:10,550
And there's others, you know.

1304
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:12,190
I'm sorry, I have to go.

1305
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:13,636
I'm not the only one.

1306
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:14,600
Okay.

1307
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,720
You want their phone numbers?

1308
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,839
No, I'm fine, thank you.

1309
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:17,672
'Cause I could give you their phone numbers.

1310
01:11:17,672 --> 01:11:19,240
You know I got their phone numbers.

1311
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,483
Thank you so much.

1312
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,020
Come back and finish your dinner.

1313
01:11:29,747 --> 01:11:30,947
You didn't eat the eyes.

1314
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:36,400
Now they'll always be watching you.

1315
01:11:42,033 --> 01:11:44,031
Mom, we're home!

1316
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:46,193
Mom where are you, we brought you some cake!

1317
01:11:46,193 --> 01:11:47,301
Suzy?

1318
01:11:47,301 --> 01:11:48,704
Mom?

1319
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:49,780
Mom?

1320
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:50,613
Suzy?

1321
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,095
Suzy?

1322
01:11:55,095 --> 01:11:55,928
Shh.

1323
01:11:56,934 --> 01:11:58,945
Suzy, it's me.
No!

1324
01:11:58,945 --> 01:11:59,778
It's okay honey.

1325
01:11:59,778 --> 01:12:00,836
It's me, I'm here.
No! No! No!

1326
01:12:00,836 --> 01:12:02,262
He can see me!

1327
01:12:02,262 --> 01:12:03,179
No! No! No!

1328
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,530
Bonnie?

1329
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,222
Can I talk to Suzy please?

1330
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,055
No!

1331
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,023
Suzy.

1332
01:12:16,482 --> 01:12:18,270
Can you hear me?

1333
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:22,638
(Suzy mumbling to herself)

1334
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:23,721
Are you Suzy?

1335
01:12:25,654 --> 01:12:26,487
Suzy?

1336
01:12:28,266 --> 01:12:29,099
Baby.

1337
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:34,715
Suzy gimme a break.

1338
01:12:36,723 --> 01:12:40,056
(Sean and Suzy moaning)

1339
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,512
Oh Suzy.

1340
01:12:42,512 --> 01:12:43,429
Suzy, whoa.

1341
01:12:44,951 --> 01:12:46,650
You're really gonna do this, aren't you?

1342
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,655
What?

1343
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,273
You were supposed to be different!

1344
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:51,420
What are you talking about?

1345
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,940
Why don't you pay for it like all the others?

1346
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,963
Then maybe you'll be honest.
(door slams)

1347
01:12:55,963 --> 01:12:56,796
Pay?

1348
01:13:00,872 --> 01:13:01,881
Who's talking?

1349
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:03,236
Oh, don't be stupid with me.

1350
01:13:03,236 --> 01:13:04,068
What?

1351
01:13:04,068 --> 01:13:05,580
You know where all that cash comes from.

1352
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,820
What do you think she does at those bars?

1353
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:08,653
You're lying.

1354
01:13:08,653 --> 01:13:10,200
And all those little tricks that turn you on,

1355
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,931
where do you think she learned them?

1356
01:13:11,931 --> 01:13:12,800
I wanna talk to Suzy.

1357
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,863
Think she made 'em up?

1358
01:13:13,863 --> 01:13:14,696
I wanna talk to Suzy now!

1359
01:13:14,696 --> 01:13:16,349
That's no half of what she knows how to do.

1360
01:13:16,349 --> 01:13:17,507
That is only half of it.
Don't touch me.

1361
01:13:17,507 --> 01:13:19,110
Don't touch me, get away from me!

1362
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:20,690
Get away from me!

1363
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,080
I can't take this anymore.
Sean?

1364
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,390
Sean?
No, get away!

1365
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:25,223
I can't deal with this.

1366
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:26,723
I can't handle this!
No!

1367
01:13:26,723 --> 01:13:28,052
I didn't know, please don't.

1368
01:13:28,052 --> 01:13:29,100
Please.

1369
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,290
Sean please!

1370
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:32,309
Please, the kids!

1371
01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:34,402
The kids, please!

1372
01:13:34,402 --> 01:13:35,235
Please.

1373
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,413
I'm sorry.

1374
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:42,915
I'm sorry, I didn't know!

1375
01:13:42,915 --> 01:13:44,373
Girls.

1376
01:13:44,373 --> 01:13:45,206
Girls!

1377
01:13:45,206 --> 01:13:46,130
What's happening?

1378
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,966
Come on, we're getting out of here.

1379
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:49,010
(girls crying)
I'll explain later.

1380
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,095
Don't, don't take them.
Get away!

1381
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:53,345
Please don't leave.
Mommy!

1382
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,425
Don't do this.

1383
01:13:56,425 --> 01:13:57,893
Come on, you're scaring them,

1384
01:13:57,893 --> 01:13:59,204
please don't do that!
(girls screaming)

1385
01:13:59,204 --> 01:14:00,637
You're scaring them, please.

1386
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:02,130
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

1387
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:02,963
Come on girls, get in the car.

1388
01:14:02,963 --> 01:14:03,910
I didn't do anything.

1389
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,930
Please, come on honey.
Suzy get away from us.

1390
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,743
Come on girls, scoot over.

1391
01:14:09,635 --> 01:14:11,852
Molly! Rosie!
Get out of here!

1392
01:14:11,852 --> 01:14:12,873
Please don't leave!

1393
01:14:12,873 --> 01:14:13,776
Please don't leave.

1394
01:14:13,776 --> 01:14:15,180
Please, my babies.

1395
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,763
Please don't leave.

1396
01:14:18,236 --> 01:14:20,901
Please, don't take my babies.

1397
01:14:20,901 --> 01:14:22,798
Sean don't leave me here.

1398
01:14:22,798 --> 01:14:24,434
Please.

1399
01:14:24,434 --> 01:14:25,268
My babies.

1400
01:14:32,031 --> 01:14:33,355
Molly.

1401
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:36,438
(Suzy starts crying)

1402
01:14:39,216 --> 01:14:41,966
(vacuum running)

1403
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:50,240
(ominous music)

1404
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:32,647
(engine starting)

1405
01:15:32,647 --> 01:15:35,314
(radio playing)

1406
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:39,373
There we go.

1407
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:42,775
Thanks, Dad.

1408
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,663
Where are we going?

1409
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,973
Anywhere you'd like, sugar.

1410
01:15:49,973 --> 01:15:51,390
Don't touch me.

1411
01:15:52,269 --> 01:15:54,019
Besides this, Suzy.

1412
01:15:58,618 --> 01:16:00,285
I would like that.

1413
01:16:04,658 --> 01:16:07,825
(laughing) that's good.

1414
01:16:07,825 --> 01:16:11,325
(both speaking inaudibly)

1415
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:32,207
(fire crackling)

1416
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:36,840
Oh my god.

1417
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,673
Daddy?

1418
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,854
Daddy, help me.

1419
01:16:41,854 --> 01:16:42,687
Help me!

1420
01:16:43,863 --> 01:16:44,696
Daddy.

1421
01:16:45,626 --> 01:16:48,439
(Suzy coughing)

1422
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:49,272
Daddy?

1423
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:05,997
(phone buttons beeping)

1424
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:08,843
Hello?

1425
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:15,293
Someone tried to set us on fire.

1426
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,960
Suzy?

1427
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,793
Where are you?

1428
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:22,682
Where am I?

1429
01:17:22,682 --> 01:17:24,559
I don't know.

1430
01:17:24,559 --> 01:17:25,477
Where am I?

1431
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,693
(loud thud)

1432
01:17:32,216 --> 01:17:34,883
(phone ringing)

1433
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,073
(dial tone)

1434
01:17:53,761 --> 01:17:56,428
(phone ringing)

1435
01:17:58,124 --> 01:17:58,957
Your daughter's here.

1436
01:17:58,957 --> 01:18:00,559
She inhaled a lot of smoke,

1437
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:01,930
and we had to pump her stomach.

1438
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:02,763
Where is she?

1439
01:18:02,763 --> 01:18:04,370
I think we should let her rest right now.

1440
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,960
She's my daughter damn it.

1441
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,830
I have to see her.

1442
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,553
I think she tried to kill herself.

1443
01:18:15,512 --> 01:18:16,570
(car door slams)

1444
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,920
Okay guys, we're going home.

1445
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,840
Did you find Mommy?

1446
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,007
Soon.

1447
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:36,304
She's not here.

1448
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:41,980
Yeah, Dr. Scanlon? This is Sean Mitchell.

1449
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,433
Have you heard from Suzy?

1450
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:47,183
I can't find her and she's not at her mother's.

1451
01:18:49,304 --> 01:18:51,554
I think I scared her, she told me some stuff.

1452
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,820
I left her home alone in the house.

1453
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:59,083
Could you call me as soon as you get this message?

1454
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:02,659
Thank you.

1455
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:03,492
Molly.

1456
01:19:04,419 --> 01:19:05,350
Rosie.

1457
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:06,683
Suzy, thank god.

1458
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:10,480
Oh, where's Sean?

1459
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,510
He's okay. The kids too.

1460
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:15,136
You'll be fine darling.

1461
01:19:15,136 --> 01:19:15,969
No.

1462
01:19:15,969 --> 01:19:16,809
Won't you be fine?

1463
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,083
Suzy?

1464
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,713
Suzy?

1465
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:31,873
Suzy?

1466
01:19:37,349 --> 01:19:38,182
Sean.

1467
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,253
Suzy.

1468
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,333
Okay, doctor says you can go home.

1469
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:50,640
Where's Sean?

1470
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,809
Did he call?

1471
01:19:51,809 --> 01:19:53,390
No, not yet.

1472
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,700
Let's get you dressed.

1473
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,532
But what about Eric?

1474
01:19:55,532 --> 01:19:57,150
I think I should talk to Eric.

1475
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:58,010
You will.

1476
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:59,830
Oh come on honey, let's go home.

1477
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:01,480
He's given up on me, hasn't he?

1478
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,881
No, no one's given up on you.

1479
01:20:03,881 --> 01:20:05,840
But it worries me to hear you think that, honey.

1480
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,073
Come on now, let's go.

1481
01:20:07,073 --> 01:20:08,073
Why?

1482
01:20:08,073 --> 01:20:09,780
Because sweetheart,

1483
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,447
what happened the other night was terrible.

1484
01:20:11,447 --> 01:20:14,280
And we're just trying to figure out why.

1485
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,180
It was terrible.

1486
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,100
I told Sean terrible things, I'm horrible.

1487
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,760
Darling, that's not true.

1488
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,480
It is true!

1489
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,980
There are others worse than me.

1490
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,770
What are you talking about?

1491
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:28,214
D.J. and Ginger,

1492
01:20:28,214 --> 01:20:29,664
and others I don't even know.

1493
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,303
Oh god, I can feel them.

1494
01:20:32,303 --> 01:20:33,603
I can feel them coming up.

1495
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,640
(Suzy crying)

1496
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,133
I don't know what else to do.

1497
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:44,540
I've called Martha,

1498
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:47,210
and I've left messages for her uncle.

1499
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,043
Yeah.

1500
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:50,723
Of course.

1501
01:20:52,809 --> 01:20:54,059
All right, I'll call you.

1502
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,993
Thanks Dr. Scanlon.

1503
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,662
Daddy?

1504
01:21:00,662 --> 01:21:01,495
Is Mommy dead?

1505
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,238
No baby, no, no.

1506
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:08,088
(Rosie crying)

1507
01:21:08,088 --> 01:21:11,171
(door creaking open)

1508
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,023
Go lie down and I'll make you a cup of tea.

1509
01:21:41,362 --> 01:21:44,779
(rapid knocking at door)

1510
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:46,933
Oh god.

1511
01:21:46,933 --> 01:21:48,660
She's gonna be all right, Sean.

1512
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,493
What happened? Where is she?

1513
01:21:49,493 --> 01:21:52,270
She's at her mother's, she's resting.

1514
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,980
She set her car on fire.

1515
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,901
But she's gonna be fine Sean.

1516
01:21:56,901 --> 01:21:57,734
Oh my god.

1517
01:21:57,734 --> 01:21:58,740
Molly!

1518
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:59,710
Rosie!

1519
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,543
Sean, wait, wait.

1520
01:22:00,543 --> 01:22:01,557
For what? I gotta see her.

1521
01:22:01,557 --> 01:22:03,300
No, no, not yet.

1522
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,000
Why? She doesn't wanna see me?

1523
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,320
Eventually, yes, of course.

1524
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,690
But right now she's still a little shaky.

1525
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:12,523
I know.

1526
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,233
I went nuts.

1527
01:22:15,776 --> 01:22:18,350
I was afraid for the girls, I was...

1528
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,754
I should never have left her alone.

1529
01:22:19,754 --> 01:22:21,279
Sean, no Sean. It wasn't your fault.

1530
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:22,112
Yes it is.

1531
01:22:22,112 --> 01:22:23,749
Is that what that doctor's been telling you?

1532
01:22:23,749 --> 01:22:25,020
No!

1533
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,170
I've gotta call him.

1534
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:27,003
No, no, Sean.

1535
01:22:27,003 --> 01:22:28,130
I don't think she'd want you to do that.

1536
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:28,963
You know,

1537
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,800
she's been having second thoughts about him.

1538
01:22:34,763 --> 01:22:35,803
We all have.

1539
01:22:37,059 --> 01:22:37,893
Why?

1540
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,640
Because of what happened last night.

1541
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,100
It wasn't Eric's fault, it was me.

1542
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,073
I went crazy.

1543
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,240
Why did you go crazy?

1544
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:50,782
She told me some things.

1545
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:53,837
She told you?

1546
01:22:55,432 --> 01:22:58,630
Or did one of the personalities?

1547
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:01,740
D.J. Ginger, Victoria, Bonnie?

1548
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,640
How can we be sure any of it was true?

1549
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:06,830
You don't think it is?

1550
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:10,282
I'm not sure.

1551
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,450
Well what about Molly and Rosie?

1552
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:14,990
They should see her.

1553
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,123
That's her biggest worry too, Sean.

1554
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,610
Right now she's afraid

1555
01:23:23,809 --> 01:23:25,960
for the children to see her the way she is.

1556
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:31,510
Remember the first time I made this?

1557
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:32,343
Mm hmm.

1558
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,117
You dropped half of it on your dress?

1559
01:23:35,117 --> 01:23:36,870
(Suzy laughs)

1560
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:39,236
What size piece you want, big or little?

1561
01:23:39,236 --> 01:23:40,068
Big.

1562
01:23:48,663 --> 01:23:51,023
I'll be right back Suzy, you wait right here.

1563
01:24:03,059 --> 01:24:04,300
What are you doing here?

1564
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,133
Didn't Chester talk to you?

1565
01:24:05,133 --> 01:24:07,163
We need to see her.
Hi girls.

1566
01:24:26,841 --> 01:24:30,591
(group talking and laughing)

1567
01:24:45,374 --> 01:24:46,590
You get everything you wanted there?

1568
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,003
I'm good with the drinks.

1569
01:24:48,003 --> 01:24:49,651
You're doing okay there, aren't you?

1570
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,330
All right, good news.

1571
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:52,930
You boys okay?

1572
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:54,430
Yeah, bring her out.

1573
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,340
Where are you sweetie?

1574
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,173
Suzy?

1575
01:24:59,173 --> 01:25:00,006
Hey come on out now.

1576
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,610
Come on out and play Suzy.

1577
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:04,790
Hold on for now.

1578
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:06,460
Now don't you wanna come out and play?

1579
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,780
Suzy, where are you?

1580
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,970
Now don't you wanna dance for our friends?

1581
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,333
Now come on out.
Yeah!

1582
01:25:11,396 --> 01:25:14,148
Come on out Suzy.

1583
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:15,898
Come on Suzy.

1584
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:18,780
Suzy, where are you?

1585
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,890
I'm sorry Sean, please not yet.

1586
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,450
We're looking for another doctor.

1587
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,850
Just give this some time, it'll work itself out.

1588
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,983
Rosie, sweetheart.

1589
01:25:27,983 --> 01:25:30,337
Wait a minute!
Mommy!

1590
01:25:30,337 --> 01:25:31,170
Mommy!

1591
01:25:34,037 --> 01:25:35,427
Mommy?

1592
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:36,727
Mommy!

1593
01:25:36,727 --> 01:25:38,071
Mommy!

1594
01:25:38,071 --> 01:25:39,213
Mommy!
Come on, Martha.

1595
01:25:39,213 --> 01:25:41,010
Wait a sec, just let her go.

1596
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,327
Martha, it's all right, let her go.

1597
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:47,720
Rosie?

1598
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,309
Rosie where are you?
Mommy?

1599
01:25:49,309 --> 01:25:51,400
Mommy don't, don't Mommy.

1600
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,461
Mommy!

1601
01:25:52,461 --> 01:25:53,336
Mommy?

1602
01:25:53,336 --> 01:25:55,126
Suzy, oh my god.

1603
01:25:55,126 --> 01:25:55,959
Rosie come here.

1604
01:25:55,959 --> 01:25:57,861
Mommy? Mommy!

1605
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,222
Get your hands off of her!

1606
01:25:59,222 --> 01:26:00,479
No, let go!

1607
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:03,786
(Rosie shouting)

1608
01:26:03,786 --> 01:26:05,396
Suzy-

1609
01:26:05,396 --> 01:26:06,780
Suzy.

1610
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:07,989
Suzy!

1611
01:26:07,989 --> 01:26:09,637
Suzy!

1612
01:26:09,637 --> 01:26:10,473
Honey?

1613
01:26:10,473 --> 01:26:11,957
Now do you understand?

1614
01:26:11,957 --> 01:26:13,007
Honey.

1615
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:14,677
(loud knocking on door)

1616
01:26:14,677 --> 01:26:18,393
Honey, I'm gonna call Dr. Scanlon, okay?

1617
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,010
Sean, wait a minute.

1618
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,490
Wait a minute, I don't think you should call.

1619
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:23,880
Well I'm calling him.

1620
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,483
Stop, this is my house damn it.

1621
01:26:25,483 --> 01:26:26,316
What are you hiding?

1622
01:26:26,316 --> 01:26:27,234
What are you trying to make her forget?

1623
01:26:27,234 --> 01:26:28,067
I'm not trying to hide anything,

1624
01:26:28,067 --> 01:26:29,013
Keeping her away from her family.

1625
01:26:29,013 --> 01:26:29,846
She's my daughter for God's sake,

1626
01:26:29,846 --> 01:26:30,679
I'm trying to protect her.

1627
01:26:30,679 --> 01:26:31,512
Hello, may I speak to Dr. Scanlon please?

1628
01:26:31,512 --> 01:26:32,890
What about your daughters?

1629
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:34,237
Dragging them out here, making them-

1630
01:26:34,237 --> 01:26:35,210
What could be worse for our daughters

1631
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,360
than Suzy going crazy?

1632
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,240
Suzy killing herself.

1633
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,076
That would be worse.

1634
01:26:39,076 --> 01:26:41,493
(loud crash)

1635
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,350
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1636
01:26:48,308 --> 01:26:49,141
I know.

1637
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:51,463
Good.

1638
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,630
That's good.

1639
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:57,380
Oh, I knew you'd say that.

1640
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,543
You did? Why?

1641
01:27:01,243 --> 01:27:04,193
I won over those men.

1642
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:10,823
Now you're next.

1643
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:12,763
Suzy I-

1644
01:27:12,763 --> 01:27:14,173
And I will die first.

1645
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,120
That's what you want.

1646
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,320
Why would I want that?

1647
01:27:22,397 --> 01:27:23,814
Because.

1648
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:30,190
You think I'm your dad, don't you?

1649
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:31,340
Messing with your head.

1650
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:34,303
Well he's dead.

1651
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:37,270
And he can't hurt you anymore.

1652
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:40,853
Can I talk to Suzy now?

1653
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,193
Sure.

1654
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,020
That means no, doesn't it?

1655
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:54,452
You're somebody new, somebody deeper.

1656
01:27:56,382 --> 01:27:58,050
(Suzy laughs)

1657
01:27:58,050 --> 01:27:58,883
Suzy?

1658
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,173
Victoria? Bonnie?

1659
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:06,860
Can any of you hear me?

1660
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,303
If you can, listen.

1661
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:11,540
I'm here talking to somebody who wants you dead.

1662
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,823
She thinks everything's your fault.

1663
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:18,160
She thinks you deserve to die,

1664
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,809
that that would solve everything.

1665
01:28:23,523 --> 01:28:25,441
They're already dead.

1666
01:28:29,032 --> 01:28:31,950
And you know why she thinks that?

1667
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,480
Because then at least,

1668
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,367
there would be some sense in the world.

1669
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:45,193
I'm bad because I hurt so much.

1670
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:48,110
That's what you think.

1671
01:28:49,798 --> 01:28:51,013
But you're not bad.

1672
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:55,843
Something happened to you when you were little.

1673
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,403
And you were helpless.

1674
01:29:01,809 --> 01:29:02,643
Not bad.

1675
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:05,393
Helpless.

1676
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,223
Let me talk to Suzy.

1677
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:16,993
Suzy.

1678
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,063
Suzy?

1679
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:31,273
Suzy, can you hear me?

1680
01:29:42,383 --> 01:29:44,047
Am I-

1681
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:44,880
am I

1682
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:47,063
hallucinating?

1683
01:29:51,809 --> 01:29:52,643
No.

1684
01:29:54,063 --> 01:29:55,291
(Suzy gasps)

1685
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:56,291
There we go.

1686
01:30:00,253 --> 01:30:02,170
Are you really there?

1687
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:06,199
Yes.

1688
01:30:10,043 --> 01:30:12,273
After everything I've done?

1689
01:30:25,799 --> 01:30:27,049
I'm so ashamed.

1690
01:30:30,182 --> 01:30:31,432
I'm so ashamed.

1691
01:30:36,242 --> 01:30:37,492
I'm so ashamed.

1692
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:42,163
(Suzy sobbing)

1693
01:30:43,612 --> 01:30:44,695
Shh.

1694
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:02,993
What now?

1695
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:07,303
Now we can begin.

1696
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:12,532
Mommy?

1697
01:31:12,532 --> 01:31:13,366
Rosie.

1698
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,948
She's okay.

1699
01:31:15,948 --> 01:31:18,166
Mommy's gonna be fine.

1700
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:19,588
It's okay.

1701
01:31:19,588 --> 01:31:21,588
We're all gonna be okay.

1702
01:31:23,635 --> 01:31:26,802
(hopeful piano music)

1703
01:32:00,546 --> 01:32:04,796
(dramatic orchestral ending music)
