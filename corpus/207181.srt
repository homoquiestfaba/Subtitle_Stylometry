00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,790
''THREE SEASONS''

2
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,510
You must be Kien An.

3
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,380
Yes, l am.

4
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,890
Follow me.

5
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,520
Here are your things.

6
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,840
You are here on recommendations.

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,610
l hope you don't let us disappoint.

8
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,670
l will not sir.

9
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,580
We follow strict rules here.

10
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,770
lt is important they are not violated.

11
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,380
Teacher Dao is no forgiving man.

12
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,050
The bell rings early every morning.

13
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,160
The flowers must be picked and
bundled to be sold in the city

14
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,290
Teacher Dao takes pride in his flowers.

15
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,590
Customers take pride in his flowers.

16
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,070
Thus, you must take pride in his flowers.

17
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,300
Try not to think about it.

18
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,820
Don't let the temple distract you.

19
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,770
lt is important to keep busy.

20
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,840
You'll soon forget it there.

21
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,310
lt looks abandoned.

22
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,310
lt is the Teacher's home.
He has not left it in years.

23
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,350
The older women say
his soul left him long ago.

24
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,430
ls this lade what is there
as pretty as a lotus?

25
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,330
Green leaves, white flowers?

26
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,430
Green leaves, white flower,

27
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,040
yellow center.

28
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,410
Yellow center. . .
white flower, green leaves.

29
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,850
lt is near the mud, yet does not smell of mud.

30
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,590
A woman's destiny is like a raindrop.

31
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,520
Some fall in the gutter. . .

32
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,170
some fall in rich ponds.

33
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,830
You buy for me? Chewing gum. . .cigarette?

34
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,290
Hai, l've been waiting all morning.
Did you bring the rubbing oil?

35
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,290
Yes, the arm still bothering you, huh?

36
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,090
lf it's not the arm, then it's the back.

37
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,730
Let me have some of that.

38
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,280
Hai, maybe you can put a stop to this debate.

39
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,440
What now?

40
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,950
You see that hotel there?

41
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,410
What about it?

42
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,110
l was betting Minh here.

43
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,790
The towels used in there must have
some kind of perfume in them.

44
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,420
What is that?

45
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
You ever notice the smell?

46
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,930
Everyone we drive from there has a fresh smell.

47
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,570
Like l said, it's the smell of money.

48
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,670
Where there's money there's that smell.

49
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,500
Well, it's a waste of money.

50
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,510
We need to work. . .

51
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,270
. . .a whole month to barely afford. . .

52
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,080
. . .their cheapest room.

53
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,590
Four star, five star. . .

54
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,550
. . .they can't match my thousand star deluxe.

55
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,790
What's your thousand star deluxe?

56
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,630
From my bed, l see a thousand stars.
No roof, just a thousand stars.

57
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,230
At least you have a bed.

58
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,370
Are you still reading that old book?

59
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,330
You sure are persistent.

60
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,500
You haven't fixed that?

61
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,330
lt's gonna get you one day.

62
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,450
Come back here!

63
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,490
l need a ride! Let's go!

64
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,220
That was close.

65
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,660
What happened?

66
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,700
Just watch the street.

67
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,430
Don't ask questions.

68
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,800
Drop me off at the Marqu Hotel.

69
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,710
Damn, my lipstick is all smeared.

70
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,510
They should know better.
l never let anyone take me home.

71
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,110
lt was great to see the look on their faces.

72
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,140
Thanks for the fast legs.

73
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,210
Should l wait?

74
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,740
No, lt'll be a while.

75
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,540
l don't mind.

76
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,280
lt'll be hours. l'll get another ride.

77
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,590
Fresh white lotuses!

78
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,230
Fresh white lotuses!

79
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,160
Fresh white lotuses!

80
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,300
Wait a minute. . .

81
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,880
Splendid, the white lotuses have arrived.

82
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,450
You must be new.

83
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,780
l've not seen you before.

84
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,660
Yes, sir. l started this week.

85
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,370
These are nice flowers your Teacher sells.

86
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,990
May l have a bundle?

87
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,670
Smells wonderful.

88
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,420
So beautiful. . .How much?

89
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,710
5,000.

90
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,580
Thank you.

91
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,100
You again. Why are you here?

92
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,100
l said you didn't have to wait.

93
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,810
l didn't mind.

94
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,210
You're not expecting more money, are you?

95
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,600
l was just making sure you had a ride.

96
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,780
Alright. Take me to District Two.

97
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,270
Tomorrow l'll work the Majestic.

98
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,270
There are wealthier guest there.

99
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,670
They know how to treat a woman.

100
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,440
l'm tired of cheap bastards.

101
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,480
You got a cigarette?

102
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,510
No.

103
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,020
lt's too damn hot for smoking anyway.

104
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,190
l could be in a cool room now if l wanted to.

105
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,090
l'd just have to do nightovers. l don't though.

106
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,200
Sometimes l wish l could
fall asleep on the large bed. . .

107
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,740
. . .and let the air-conditioner run all night
until l want to wake up.

108
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,230
That's what they all do up there.

109
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,630
l could use a drink right now.
l bet you don't drink.

110
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,670
No.

111
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,460
What do you do then?

112
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,300
You don't smoke, you don't drink
. . .what the hell do you do?

113
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,530
Besides waiting for pretty girls.

114
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Damn it! Not another blackout!

115
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,170
The third time this week.

116
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,530
lt's damn hot on a night like this.

117
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,850
What's the problem?

118
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,140
Where are you headed?

119
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,220
Taking her home.

120
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,190
lt's all right. She lives here.

121
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,780
Let them go!

122
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
Our block hasn't been safe during blackouts.

123
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,430
Some streets have it worse though.

124
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,070
Stop at the lamppost ahead.

125
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,960
Yellow center, white flower, green leaves.

126
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
lt is near the mud, yet does not smell of mud.

127
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,830
A woman's destiny. . .

128
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,370
. .is like a raindrop

129
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,780
Some fall in gutter. . .

130
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,390
. . .some fall in rich ponds.

131
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,660
Can anyone ever know how many stalks.

132
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,030
. . .are in a rice field?

133
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,580
How many bends are in river?
How many layers are in a cloud?

134
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,910
Can anyone sweep the leaves of a forest?

135
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,950
And tell the wind to shake the trees no more.

136
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,550
How many leaves must a silkworm eat. . .

137
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,750
. . .to make a dress of colors from the past.

138
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,740
How much rain must. . .

139
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,790
Don't let them bother you.

140
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,720
For the old women sing the same song.
They've been here so long

141
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,350
they think they own the lake.

142
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,490
l didn't know.

143
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,290
How could you?

144
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,070
Let's get back to work.

145
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,470
Lack of work
makes Mr.Huy look bad to Teacher Dao. . .

146
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,800
. . .thus he punishes severely for it.

147
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,640
After all these years
still can't stand this heat.

148
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,640
You just have to not think about it.

149
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,850
Throw up a bag of nuts for me!

150
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,260
l'm waiting for the day that corner of ours. . . .

151
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,850
. . .is replaced by a hotel.

152
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,120
lt's so crowded, we just have to live with it.

153
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,830
l hope when l'm their age
l'm still not waiting around to give rides.

154
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,180
Tell me something.

155
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,510
You ever notice the American over there?

156
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,080
Just him and his cigarettes. . .

157
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,820
Days?

158
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,320
Days?

159
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,430
He's been there for weeks.
Someone in the hotel told me.

160
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,900
He sits there smoking all day.

161
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,600
He just stares at that restaurant. . .

162
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,370
. . .across from him.

163
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,440
Bet you didn't know that.

164
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,180
that used to be a G. l .A. Bar.

165
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,120
l got stuck driving him around town
last week. We went around. . .

166
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,160
. . .looking fo a young woman in a photo.
l personally think he's nuts.

167
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,260
Let's go back to our corner
and join the guys.

168
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,700
Kien An.

169
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,740
Get dressed.

170
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,410
Teacher Dao would like to see you.

171
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,590
Thank you for coming.

172
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,770
Do not be afraid.

173
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,950
l have a simple request.

174
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,250
Your song from this afternoon. . .

175
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,160
. . .tell me where you learned it?

176
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,030
From my mother.

177
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,230
She sang it to me when l was a child.

178
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,600
l would like you to sing the song.

179
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,540
l don't understand.

180
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,610
You were not brought here to understand.

181
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,740
Your song from this afternoon. . .

182
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,780
l want you to sing it.

183
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,030
Can anyone ever know.

184
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,500
How many bends are in the river?

185
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,140
How many layers are in a monsoon cloud?

186
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,650
Can anyone. . .

187
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,870
. . .sweep the leaves on a forest.

188
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,580
And tell the wind to shake. . .

189
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,870
You buy, you buy?

190
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,240
Stop! Stop!

191
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,250
Hey, Woody!

192
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,280
Pay money!

193
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,290
Pay money!

194
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,920
How much?

195
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,360
Have you seen my box?

196
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,360
Mr. have you seen my box?

197
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,270
l hope. . .

198
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,610
. .my private thoughts. . .

199
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,110
. . .have been entertaining.

200
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,690
l'm sorry. l will leave immediately.

201
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,720
How much of my work did you read?

202
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,260
Enough.

203
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,270
ls that right?

204
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,670
Enough. . .

205
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,480
. . .to know your pain.

206
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,970
What do you know about pain?

207
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,420
l too have had a hard life.

208
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,680
l too have been alone.

209
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:02,930
. . .to have children point
and mock as you walk down the street?

210
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,860
Or when they see you coming. . .

211
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,440
. . .to have people
close their doors and windows?

212
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,030
ls that why you hide in the shadow?

213
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,240
l am not hiding.

214
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,240
They say
you have not left this temple in years.

215
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,780
More nonsense!

216
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,690
. . .my ears escape these windows
to embrace the songs of the birds.

217
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,080
My nose pierces these walls. . .

218
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,060
. . .and naps in the fragrance of my lotuses.

219
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,660
With every sunrise and sunset. . .

220
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,140
. . .my eyes flutter into the air.

221
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,760
Any my heart. . .

222
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,570
My heart has transcended

223
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:51,070
. . .above the bondage of man.

224
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,250
Until you have travelled far,

225
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,990
Do not come back here.

226
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,470
On fully flapping wings fly l.

227
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,210
Chasing chubby, Lazy clouds across the sky.

228
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,980
And herding evening breezes
through plains and meadows.

229
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,010
To visit the Seas my fluttering sails l see.

230
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,550
Brother to the Marlin together in the night.

231
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,660
Pucking at the moon her reflection in waves.

232
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,160
l raise my bardly which on the rising tides.

233
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,230
Oh rise, gentle sun, golden in your reach.

234
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,130
And weave, dear Moon, your silvery filament.

235
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,870
Unveil away the darkness that over me hangs. . .

236
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,070
One this funered cloth my they, my Preshiment.

237
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,340
Upon a lake a lotus wish l be.

238
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,710
Scenting the day's breath
with fragrance and poetry.

239
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,340
Searching in the wind
for traces of my formed spirit. . .

240
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,920
The discovery my reflected present

241
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,360
Can l see. . .

242
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,230
that was the last poem l wrote.

243
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,730
Before l lost my fingers.

244
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,180
You may leave now.

245
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,840
l will lend you my fingers.

246
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,940
You do not want to be bothered
with a bitter man's thoughts.

247
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,440
l would not be here if it was bother.

248
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,310
You should leave. .

249
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,720
. . .before others begin to worry.

250
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,260
Wait.

251
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,230
Maybe.

252
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,130
. . .we could start tomorrow.

253
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,100
We shall start tomorrow.

254
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,720
Have you shined any shoes
for an American with a wooden case?

255
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,170
l haven't shined one shoe in this rain.

256
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,840
You're not following me, are you?

257
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,110
You said you would start working here.

258
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,180
Yeah, so what?

259
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,310
That didn't mean for you to be here.

260
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,580
Did you wait in front all night?

261
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,850
l just thought you might want a ride.

262
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,620
There aren't too many safe cyclos at this hour.

263
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,420
Yeah, well how do l know you're one of them?

264
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,200
Pull over right here.

265
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,630
This is for you.

266
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,560
Please, l can't take it.

267
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,870
Take it.

268
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,380
l'm usually not so generous.

269
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,940
What are you doing?

270
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,720
lt's too hot to sleep indoors.

271
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,520
You're crazy.

272
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,550
l'd trade places with you anytime.

273
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,650
So pale was the moonlight. . .

274
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,490
. . .it could not shroud the pallid lake.

275
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,670
Yet l found joy. . .

276
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,110
. . .admist searing pair.

277
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,110
to write these words.

278
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,710
. . .is like striking a note.

279
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,250
Plucking a chord. . .

280
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,060
. .vibrating a stream of light.

281
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:57,590
lt's melody echoes from my forlorn heart.

282
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,690
Did you get all that?

283
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,370
Yes, l have it all.

284
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:21,610
Good.

285
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,050
That will be enough for now.

286
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,360
l could go on further.

287
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,000
Unfortunately, l cannot.

288
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,600
l am out of words for now.

289
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,440
Do you ever plan on leaving this place?

290
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:58,320
l sometimes have this dream. . .

291
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,350
l dream my fingers have grown back.

292
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,920
. . .and the swelling on my face has subsided.

293
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,300
l dream that l have with me. . .

294
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,840
. . .a dozen baskets of my best white lotuses.

295
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,970
. . .and travel to the floating market of youth.

296
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,640
As l approach the women. . .

297
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,810
l would free all of my lotuses into the water. . .

298
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,350
. . .and watch them float through the market
like a white river.

299
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:35,260
lt would be then,
that l had finally returned home. . .

300
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,560
. . .set free and pure.

301
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,170
Then l would wake up into the black night

302
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,430
. . .and realize it was simply a dream. . .

303
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:54,980
. . .one of many that will never be fulfilled.

304
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,280
lt's not too late.

305
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,790
lt is late.

306
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,490
lt is later than you realize.

307
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,300
Don't come back until you find it.

308
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:50,360
Have you heard?
The cyclo race is on after all.

309
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,460
Who's my challenger this year?

310
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,460
You know Khoi over there?

311
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,660
ls he the one to beat?

312
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,430
Not only is he entering,
but he's betting he'll beat you.

313
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,200
And you, are you entering?

314
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:07,680
l don't think so.

315
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:21,320
You'll think l'm crazy. . .

316
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,490
What did you say?

317
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,530
l said l really enjoy the heat.

318
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,460
To most people it's unbearable.

319
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,440
l remember going to school
and wearing a white Ao Dai.

320
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,500
. . .and near our school
were rows of Phuong Vi trees. . .

321
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,810
. . .with red flowers that blossom
during the warm months.

322
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,090
All the girls would put them in their hair. . .

323
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,280
But if we were lucky,
a boy would give them to us.

324
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:55,090
And we would dry them as bookmarks.

325
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:00,730
So we wouldn't forget the boy.

326
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,270
You must have gotten a lot of flowers.

327
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,850
Miss. . .How much do you charge?

328
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,620
Charge for what?

329
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,750
. . .and evening with you.

330
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,450
Fifty dollars.

331
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,420
But as you know l don't do overnights.

332
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,230
Why? You have some new clients for me?

333
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,800
No. Curious, that's all.

334
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:46,110
Hey, don't think
l'm going to be doing this forever.

335
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,970
l have plans you know.

336
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,820
There are other ways to make money.

337
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,580
Yeah, Like what?

338
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:56,750
Like my mother. . .

339
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,860
. . .who died breaking her back for her family.

340
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,430
What did she get out of it?

341
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,220
That's not going to happen to me.

342
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,260
Have you been in one of those hotels?

343
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:09,660
No.

344
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,110
lt's a different world in there.

345
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,810
They are not like us.

346
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,780
They have a different walk, a different talk.

347
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,380
The sun rises for people like them. Not us.

348
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,010
We live in their shadows. . .

349
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,620
. . .and it grows bigger with each new hotel built.

350
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,190
Next time pay close attention. . .

351
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,230
. . .to who comes through those front glass doors.

352
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,400
How many do you see like yourself?

353
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,880
One day l will remain in that world.

354
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,050
. . .to become one of them.

355
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,280
l'm not sure that's the solution.

356
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,160
Yeah, what do you suggest,
marry a cyclo driver?

357
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,410
Here are your flowers.

358
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,010
Thank you.

359
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,500
Could l have some flowers?

360
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,200
You are selling, aren't you?

361
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,630
Yes l figured you want the. . .

362
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,300
Plastic lotuses?

363
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,570
l want no part of it.

364
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,940
They're popular.
l've had trouble selling my flowers all day.

365
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,740
l've yet to sell one.

366
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,020
People have been giving in to their convenience.

367
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,890
And they won't wilt or die.

368
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:28,060
They even spray the flowers
to make them smell real. . .

369
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,430
These days. . .

370
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,700
. .that seems to be the trend for everything.

371
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,870
Give me a couple.

372
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:44,270
How much?

373
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:46,780
Thank you.

374
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,890
ls that you Woody?

375
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,120
l'm being chased.

376
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:33,990
Quick, get on.

377
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,210
Causing trouble again?

378
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,410
lt was stolen.

379
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,680
Have you given any rides
to an American with a case like mine?

380
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,850
l haven't seen anyone with a case like yours.

381
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,260
And in this rain it's hard to see anything.

382
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,320
Stay out of trouble Woody.

383
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,120
l'll find you if l see him. Go on.

384
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:58,770
Watchout for the motorbikes.

385
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:11,050
Don't disturb my restaurant again!

386
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,350
l'm sorry.

387
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,780
Teacher Dao has
terminated your meetings with him as of today.

388
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,080
Mr. Huy, is something wrong?

389
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:32,160
. . .for you to write.

390
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:34,200
How is that possible?

391
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,330
We just started writing.
He can't be out of poems.

392
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:43,430
lt is not for me to question the teacher.

393
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,700
Could l speak to him?

394
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,110
lf you just let me talk to him. . .

395
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,050
l'm sorry but his request is clear.

396
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,860
Enough.
l recommend you return to the sleeping hall.

397
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,340
ls everything okay?

398
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,920
Are you all right?

399
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,870
Please l have to go now.

400
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,280
Where's my case? You took my case.

401
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,890
Beat it! Quit bothering the customers!

402
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,990
No problem, tell me what he say.

403
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,140
What happened?

404
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:26,820
He say you make him offer
then up and left with his case.

405
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:39,170
You see. He says he didn't take anything. . .

406
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,050
l want you to leave...and don't come back here!

407
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:18,350
l'm glad you could make it.

408
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,760
That's what Binh said last year. . .

409
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:23,800
. . .right before l beat him.

410
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,090
Brothers and sisters. . .

411
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,630
. . .are you ready for the cyclo race?

412
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,700
Riders, are you ready?

413
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,100
On your mark. Get set. . . Go!

414
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,890
Look, l no longer need a ride from you.

415
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,860
lt's better for both on us.

416
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,190
ls something wrong?

417
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:12,630
l just won't be needing. . .

418
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,990
. . .a ride anymore, all right?

419
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:17,260
Did you see me race today?

420
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:18,860
No.

421
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,430
l won.

422
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,070
Congratulations.

423
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,830
l'll follow you home.

424
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,670
l have 50 dollars.

425
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,330
Should we get started now?

426
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,070
What is this all about?

427
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:00,710
Open it.

428
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:06,920
Wait. . .

429
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:12,180
l want you to put it on without your make-up

430
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:15,550
Look, what does it matter?

431
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,350
Please, l've already bought this for you.

432
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,500
Walk back and forth for me.

433
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,660
l want you to sleep.

434
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:52,140
l just want to watch you sleep.

435
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,130
How much?

436
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:54,400
5,000 dongs.

437
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,020
Hello.

438
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,020
What are you doing here?

439
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:47,790
l've. . . l've been waiting at the Hotel
but you haven't been around.

440
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,990
Didn't l tell you. . .

441
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:50,930
l no longer need a ride from you.

442
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,270
Besides, l don't work there anymore,

443
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,060
Please leave.

444
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,210
What do you want from me?

445
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:07,010
l did what you asked.
Why can't you leave me alone?

446
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,810
l want to spend another night with you.

447
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,650
l'll pay you again.

448
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,220
Wait here.

449
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:25,200
Here, take it. l don't want your money.

450
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,860
l don't deserve it.

451
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,630
We didn't make love.

452
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:32,970
So you owe me nothing.

453
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:40,470
You have given me more than you know.

454
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,010
What are you trying to do to me.

455
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:45,390
Why me.

456
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,650
Have you forgetten l've been. . .

457
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:49,760
. . .with many men?

458
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:52,250
Not with you the way l have.

459
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:56,390
Open your eyes Hai.

460
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:00,740
l am a whore. . .

461
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:08,240
. . .and you were just a cyclo driver.

462
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,450
That's all.

463
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:16,480
Nothing more.

464
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:26,090
Please don't make me feel
what l'm not capable of.

465
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,330
lt's alright. Let her in.

466
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:39,640
Why?

467
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,550
There was no need for you to know

468
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:56,460
Why now, when you have fought so long?

469
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,540
Do your words mean nothing to you?

470
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:06,000
l have hidden from Death long enough

471
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:13,150
. . .to welcome it. . .

472
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,580
. . .as my final guest.

473
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:26,220
Do you know why. . .

474
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:30,820
. . .the first night you were here?

475
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:37,960
The song you sang
in the lake that afternoon. . .

476
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:45,410
. . .had crossed my ear before

477
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:51,480
. . .of the women
of the floating market of my childhood.

478
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:56,820
l had forgotten. . .

479
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,330
. . .my youth.

480
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:09,700
The only time. . .

481
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:19,280
. . . l was pure and whole. . .

482
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:23,390
. . .your song.

483
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:31,990
l would like you to sing. . .

484
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:37,690
. . .that song one last time.

485
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:58,920
Can anyone ever know?

486
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,220
How many bends are in a river?

487
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:08,620
How many layers are a cloud?

488
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:14,300
Can anyone sweep the leaves of a forest?

489
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:21,370
. . .to shake the tree no more?

490
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:29,040
How many leaves must the silkworm eat. . .

491
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:35,920
. . .to make a dress of colors form the past?

492
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:40,120
How much rain must fall from the sky. . .

493
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:47,400
. . .before the ocean overflows with tears.

494
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:56,880
How many years must the moon. . .
ln the middle of the night,

495
01:30:57,310 --> 01:31:02,450
the moon comes and waits nearby. . .

496
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:06,750
He who can steal my heart. . .

497
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:15,720
l will forever sing joyful songs.

498
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,610
Hey Woody!

499
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,040
Come join us!

500
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,180
Are you in?  Yeah, l'm in.

501
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:39,100
Woody! What's taking so long?

502
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,320
He will see you now.

503
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,150
Thank you for coming.

504
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,690
Please have a seat.

505
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:49,500
Thank you, sir.

506
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:59,350
He wanted you to have this.

507
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:11,990
The teacher was a handsome man.

508
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:18,970
When the leprosy spread to his face. . .

509
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,260
. . .it devastated him.

510
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,510
He blamed himself. . .

511
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:29,510
. . .and lived a life of self-punishment.

512
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,980
The photo was taken on his 23rd birthday.

513
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:41,920
Six months later he sent to his campus

514
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:45,490
The photo has remained hidden until now.

515
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:55,830
His words will not fall on deaf ears.

516
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,940
lf there is anything I can do for you. . .

517
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:03,280
. . .do not hesitate to present your request.

518
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,660
There is one thing.

519
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:31,390
You don't have to pretend any more.
