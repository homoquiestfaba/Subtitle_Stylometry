63
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:55,861
She's real excited.

66
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:03,300
It means so much
we couldn't say no.

67
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,305

Excuse me!

74
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:53,378
Excuse me! Wheelchair case!

75
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,379
Excuse me.

76
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,013
I'm sorry. She's paralyzed.

77
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:57,914
I am not.

78
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,715
Excuse me.

79
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,717
May I help you, ma'am?

80
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,385
Oh, thank you.

81
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,919
She's a lifelong democrat.

82
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,620
She still votes every time.

83
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:09,556
She's been bumping my feet
against everybody.

84
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,424
Thank you so much.

85
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:14,860
This is the high
point of her life.

86
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,761
Let us through, please.

87
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:18,395
Thank you. Thank you.

88
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:21,398
She doesn't have much time.

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,566
Come on, Jackie.

90
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:27,970
Jackie!

91
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:29,037
Jackie!

92
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,605
Is that Johnson?

93
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,406
Who cares? She looks wonderful.

94
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,442
I have the pattern
to that suit.

95
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:38,211
We have the same tastes.
Please shake our hands.

96
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,979
Jackie!

97
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:41,880
My bag.

98
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:42,947
My bag!

99
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,049
Lurene, my bag's gone.

100
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,051
I said keep it on your lap.

101
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:48,419
My bag is gone.

102
00:05:56,261 --> 00:06:00,229
What a beautiful suit.
I love that color.

103
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:03,098
Get out of my way.

104
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,800
Oh, Mrs. Kennedy, please.

105
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:08,002
Oh, my God.

106
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,970
Did you get the bag?

107
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:11,972
I'll keep it this time.

108
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:13,506
You spoke to them?

109
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:16,275
They seemed like a nice couple.

110
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,416
Watch out.

111
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,450
My God.

112
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,086
What's wrong with him?

113
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,099
Hey!

114
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:51,002
You guys know what happened?

115
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:53,671
Over the radio.

116
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:07,016
It's on the TV.

117
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:14,123

183
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:02,317
<i>I will do my best.</i>

184
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:05,787
<i>That is all I can do.</i>

185
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:08,923
<i>I ask for your help.</i>

186
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:11,458
You want me to take you

187
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,426
out to dinner or something?

188
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:15,428
No. I want to see

189
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,363
where they're burying him,

190
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:18,964
Boston or Washington.

191
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:20,332
What's the difference?

192
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:23,335
I got bean-and-bacon
and clam chowder.

193
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:25,970
What are the maps for, baby?

194
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:27,972
Do you want them mixed?

195
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:28,973
Baby.

196
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:31,808
All right. All right.

197
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,977
I think we should
go to the funeral.

198
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,945
What?

199
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,481
The president's funeral.

200
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,983
You could be back to work

201
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,151
by Tuesday or Wednesday.

202
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:48,387
I'm on call, like I told you.

203
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,623
Bob could cover for you.

204
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:56,360
It could be a second honeymoon.

205
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,995
Remember the cherry
trees in Washington?

206
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:04,066
It would be nice going there.

207
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:14,408
We deserve a second honeymoon.

208
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,010
I'll take you to new Orleans.

209
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:19,045
I have to see her.

210
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:20,379
He was my president,

211
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:23,048
the only one I voted for.

212
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,850
Because he looked
like a movie star.

213
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,018
It was more than that.

214
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,386
The new frontier.

215
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:32,021
She got me through the baby.

216
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:33,422
You know she did.

217
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:36,591
I'd be dead if it
wasn't for her.

218
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:38,259
Don't talk like that.

219
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,397
You can watch it on the TV.

220
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,932
You'll get a better view.

221
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,068
Fix your own goddamn soup!

222
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,404
I don't need you.
I'll go by myself.

223
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,038
Damn it, lurene!

224
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,041
You've got to stop
this crazy stuff!

225
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,043
You are not going anywhere!

226
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,078
That's the end of it!

227
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,880
I didn't mind you taking my car

228
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:07,048
and driving to the airport,

229
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,450
and I know that old lady

230
00:13:09,452 --> 00:13:11,418
didn't make you take her,

231
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,053
but this here, this is crazy.

232
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:17,622
I can't let you.
I'm putting my foot down.

233
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:24,094
You go too far, is all.

234
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:34,369
Well, thank you for your
opinion and your sympathy.

spitting on me...

language, especially today.

238
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,116

they're burying him.

361
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:08,499
No. We're just going home.

362
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:13,435
It's going to be
a hard Thanksgiving.

363
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:17,171
He did a lot for the negro.

364
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:18,271
Right.

365
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:20,672
Do you want this?

366
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:21,806
I'm finished.

367
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,008
It's got lots of pictures.

368
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,978
Oh...

369
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:33,515
Thanks.

370
00:22:33,517 --> 00:22:35,183
You're welcome.

371
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:17,055
<i>It's understood</i>
<i>that arrangements</i>

372
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:20,658
<i>are underway for the burial</i>
<i>of the president</i>

373
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,660
<i>in Arlington national cemetery.</i>

374
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,965
Ma'am.

375
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,033
Ray.

376
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:34,669
Oh, jeez. You scared me,

377
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:36,671
just like the boogeyman.

378
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:40,507
Coming up to spring creek.

379
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:42,575
10-minute stop.

380
00:23:42,577 --> 00:23:44,677
Oh, thank you.

381
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,047
This whole thing
has just got me...

382
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:50,315
I just keep thinking...

383
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:56,520
Maybe it's all not real.

384
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,555
They said on the radio

385
00:23:58,557 --> 00:24:00,723
that they'll bury him
in Arlington.

386
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:04,593
Well, you win.

387
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:17,705
That's my husband ray.

388
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:21,741
It's his trophy, like a prize.

389
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:23,075
It's hard to see.

390
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:26,111
It's a little
naked man bowling.

391
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:28,580
Oh, and that's hazel.

392
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:31,516
She owns the beauty
parlor I work for.

393
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:34,519
That streaky part's
a rinse I tried,

394
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,920
and that's me.

395
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:38,789
Well, I know,
but the dress looks good.

396
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,524
Excuse me, ma'am.

397
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:41,892
That's enough now, jonell.

398
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,593
Don't bother the lady.

399
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:46,529
She's too quiet to be a bother.

400
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:49,532
I was the same way at her age.

401
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:51,901
Wouldn't open my mouth
to anyone.

402
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:54,904
Maybe she'll grow
out of it, too.

403
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:58,140
You can stretch out in the back.

404
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:01,742
Here, hon.

405
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,811
Let's go.

406
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:09,781
Thank you, again.

407
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,048
Mm.

408
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:27,796
One good thing about a bus,

409
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:29,731
puts you right to sleep.

410
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,132
Excuse me.

411
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:32,399
Oh.

412
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:37,770
I can never sleep in a car.

413
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:40,606
Ray, my husband...
he has a nice car,

414
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,341
but he couldn't come.

415
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:45,777
He wanted to, but work and all.

416
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,779
Isn't it sad, what happened?

417
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,781
Caroline turns 6
next Wednesday.

418
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:51,149
Isn't that sad?

419
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:52,150
Yeah.

420
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,785
Yours is about 6, isn't she?

421
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,955
I almost had
a little girl, but I...

422
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,791
I told you already. I'm sorry.

423
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,693
That's o.K.

424
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:08,763
I only know her first name.

425
00:26:08,765 --> 00:26:10,297
Johnson.

426
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:12,666
I'm Paul Johnson.

427
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:14,634
I'm Mrs. Hallett.

428
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:21,493
Driver, on your left.

429
00:27:24,864 --> 00:27:26,663
Aah!

430
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:39,440
Are you all right?

431
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:44,277
Yes, I think so. Thank you.

432
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:48,247
You o.K., hon?

433
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,449
Oh, my God.

434
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:55,787
Now, what exactly did you see?

435
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:57,188
I was asleep.

436
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,057
Mr. Johnson must have seen it.

437
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,763
Any chance of a lift?

438
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:10,899
Sorry, but I'm turning
off just up here.

439
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:14,935
I don't see him anywhere.

440
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,904
Oh, Mr. Johnson!

441
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:27,279
What are you doing?
They said to stay.

442
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:28,913
Here's your doll, honey.

443
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,882
She's fine. Not even a scratch.

444
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,950
She was on the floor.

445
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:35,918
What's he want?

446
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:39,320
You saw everything.

447
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:40,754
Shit.

448
00:28:40,756 --> 00:28:42,956
They needed witnesses.

449
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,925
Just tell him what you saw.

450
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:48,426
Identification?

451
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:49,927
Sure.

452
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:59,903
"Paul cater."
Didn't you say Johnson?

453
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:11,112
Uh, I... I always
get names wrong.

454
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,749
That school bus there,

455
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:17,851
that's taking y'all
to the depot

456
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:19,052
in readyville.

457
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:21,687
Lieutenant's on his way there.

458
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:25,624
I want you there, boy.

459
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:34,899
What time's this one
get into D.C.?

460
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,434
About 11:00 on Monday morning.

461
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:39,102
O.K. Thank you.

462
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:40,436
Yes, ma'am?

463
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:43,071
11 A.M. that's o.K.
That's good.

464
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,076
What are you doing, honey?

465
00:29:57,085 --> 00:30:00,086
Tell me, sweetie,
is your last name Johnson?

466
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:08,726
I guess your daddy's
playing games on me, huh?

467
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:13,730
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

468
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:22,737
They killed the president.

469
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:26,407
I almost shook his hand,

470
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,742
and they... they killed him.

471
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,413
I'm lying to the police,

472
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,115
and people are lying to me.

473
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,484
My husband's ready
to divorce me.

474
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:42,120
I can't do this.
I can't do this anymore.

475
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,093
Sorry, honey.
I'm just a little sad.

476
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:52,995
Did your mamma die?

477
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:56,531
No, honey.
I'm just a little sad

478
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:59,500
about the president and all.

479
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:01,168
Well...

480
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:05,171
You do know how to talk,

481
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:07,706
don't you, hmm?

482
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,974
Well, that's good, honey.

483
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:12,609
That's nice.

484
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:15,778
Now we don't have to
be shy anymore.

485
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:19,347
Did your mamma die?

486
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,352
You poor thing.

487
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:30,155
Here, I've just been
blabbering on,

488
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:32,123
feeling sorry for myself.

489
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:38,195
Come on. We've got
some time before the bus.

490
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,363
Want a Coca-Cola?

491
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,166
Come on.

492
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,043
When did you see the car?

493
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:59,379
I was in the back of the bus.

494
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:01,013
We know.

495
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:03,981
There you go.

496
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:05,582
Let's get our picture taken.

497
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:06,583
Want to?

498
00:32:19,997 --> 00:32:22,197
That's a 1960 Chevrolet.

499
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:24,499
A white Chevy.

500
00:32:26,603 --> 00:32:29,570
<i>Folks, there will be</i>
<i>a short layover...</i>

501
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:33,106
Oh, that's a good one of you.

502
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:37,676
Oh, I knew my eyes were closed.

503
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:41,046
Honey, you've got
some blood on your head.

504
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:44,215
How come we didn't see that?

505
00:32:44,217 --> 00:32:46,250
Come on.

506
00:32:48,587 --> 00:32:51,220
From the back of the bus,

507
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:53,522
you witnessed a 1960
Chevrolet impala,

508
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:56,525
which you referred
to as a white Chevy,

509
00:32:56,527 --> 00:33:01,796
attempt to pass
and then eventually pass

510
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,933
a 1962 light green
Pontiac or oldsmobile.

511
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:07,801
Ow.

512
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:11,804
What? Are you hurt
over here, too?

513
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,809
Let me see.

514
00:33:45,268 --> 00:33:47,268
Here you're making
an assumption

515
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,137
that the pickup
was making an attempt

516
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:52,305
to avoid a collision

517
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:54,307
with the 1960 Chevy impala.

518
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:56,575
At this time,
you hollered something,

519
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,444
you don't recall what,
to the bus driver.

520
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:15,292
Who is he, jonell, huh?

521
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:19,295
Now, honey,
I'm your friend, o.K.?

522
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,134
Is jonell your real name?

523
00:34:25,136 --> 00:34:27,769
It's not Johnson. Is it cater?

524
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,537
Is jonell cater right?

525
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:31,705
No.

526
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,341
Look, I told you

527
00:34:35,343 --> 00:34:38,310
I went to get my little girl.

528
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:40,945
Mr. Cater, the Tennessee
highway patrol

529
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:43,814
did not send me
out here at night

530
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,715
to play games.

531
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:48,684
We will have a complete
statement from you

532
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,552
of everything
that you witnessed.

533
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:52,954
You understand me?

534
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:58,692
Yes, sir.

535
00:34:58,694 --> 00:35:00,160
That's good.

536
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:01,161
Long distance.

537
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:03,296
Operator, this is an emergency.

538
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:05,298
How may I help you?

539
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,200
Who do I talk to
about a kidnapping?

540
00:35:08,202 --> 00:35:10,335
What city?

541
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:11,703
Dallas, Texas.

542
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:13,905
Hold the line.
I'll connect you.

543
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:15,907
Hello?

544
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,708
Federal bureau
of investigation.

545
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,342
Please state your name.

546
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:20,343
Lurene hallett.

547
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:21,344
Ma'am?

548
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:23,346
All I want to know

549
00:35:23,348 --> 00:35:26,716
is if you have a little
colored girl missing.

550
00:35:26,718 --> 00:35:29,385
I don't want to cause trouble.

551
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:32,388
Anyone report that?
About 5 years old?

552
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,255
Yes, ma'am.

553
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:36,358
Could you please
give us the number

554
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,759
you're calling from?

555
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,360
Let me see.

556
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:42,730
Uh, kl5-6422.

557
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:45,399
There's a little
colored girl here.

558
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:47,768
She's traveling with
this colored man,

559
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,870
and there's something wrong.

560
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:02,281
Who did you call?

561
00:36:02,283 --> 00:36:03,248
Excuse me?

562
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,883
Just then. Who did you call?

563
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:08,218
If you must know, Mr. Cater,

564
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,420
if that's who you are,

565
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:12,889
I tried to reach my husband...

566
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:16,392
If it's any of your
concern, which it's not.

567
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:19,762
Me and my little girl
will be going now.

568
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:22,564
She says she's not
your little girl.

569
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:25,233
And don't you pull her away.

570
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:27,201
There's people all around here,

571
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:29,303
and I'll scream, I swear.

572
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:38,111
She spoke to you?

573
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,980
Maybe you said
not to, but she did,

574
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:43,048
didn't you, sweetheart?

575
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,217
Well, she did before.

576
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:48,385
Her name's not
cater or Johnson.

577
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:49,986
You're not her father.

578
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:53,422
I am her father, Mrs. Hallett.

579
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:56,391
She just doesn't
understand that yet.

580
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:58,626
She's confused.

581
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,061
Her mother died suddenly.

582
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:03,595
I know about that,

583
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,997
and I know about the bruises.

584
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:09,266
What else have you seen?

585
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,302
Have you seen her run from me?

586
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:14,637
Have you seen her pull away?

587
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,605
See who she comes to.

588
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:19,907
I've seen you act
like a guilty man.

589
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,109
Honey.

590
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:28,346
Tell this lady who I am.

591
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:31,449
When did I bring you the doll?

592
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:32,917
Remember Monday?

593
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,021
And this.

594
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,458
Remember I showed you
these that day?

595
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,594
Huh?

596
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,434
Who is that, huh?

597
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:00,540
Is that mamma?

598
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:25,161
Who hurt you, honey?
Was it this man?

599
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,165
No.

600
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,604
I took her from
the county home.

601
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,005
Somebody there beat her.

602
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:41,608
I don't know who,
and I sure as hell

603
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,644
wasn't going to
leave her there.

604
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:48,581
I can fight for her
better back home.

605
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,983
So now, Mrs. Hallett,

606
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:54,619
if you'd just leave us
alone, we'll be fine.

607
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:57,622
It's just, when I saw
the bruises...

608
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:01,258
Oh, my God.

609
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,259
What?

610
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:04,427
The phone. That's the FBI.

611
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:08,631
I gave them that number
to call me back.

612
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:10,099
Mister...

613
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:13,468
hello.

614
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:21,007
Kidnapping?

615
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:23,009
You've got the wrong number.

616
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:25,878
This is the
readyville bus depot.

617
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,814
Did you say you're from the FBI?

618
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,049
Reckon you guys were busy.

619
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:35,452
Mr. Cater!

620
00:39:35,454 --> 00:39:36,453
Shh...

621
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:38,621
Mr. Cater, it was them.

622
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:41,724
You've got to get out of here.

623
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:44,026
It's my fault. I panicked.

624
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:47,029
Look, if I asked you
to watch jonell,

625
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:50,232
would you do it
and not call anyone?

626
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:52,500
I won't make any calls.

627
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:54,834
Honey,

628
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:57,837
stay with her, all right?

629
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,739
Maybe if I just
tried to explain things...

630
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:03,842
when we're gone,
explain all you want to.

631
00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:07,078
Get my suitcase
and meet me over there.

632
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:14,718
Honey, do you know what
his suitcase looks like?

633
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:18,855
O.K. Come on. Go faster, o.K?

634
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:21,858

00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:48,514
I'm looking for a tall colored
man and a little girl.

645
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:49,882
Have you seen them?

646
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:51,750
No.

647
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:05,595

I can't stay any longer, see?

652
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,154
I've got to be someplace.

653
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,792
He'll be right here, honey.

654
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,564
You're not scared, are you?

655
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:51,566
Good-bye.

656
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,572
You call me at this number.

657
00:41:58,574 --> 00:42:02,775
Just dial a zero
and say it's collect, o.K.?

658
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:06,411
If anybody hurts you
or anything.

659
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:09,847
O.K. I'm going to
put it in your pocket.

660
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:14,350
<i>Final call for Knoxville,</i>

662
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:45,812
May I have
your attention, please?

663
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,181
Folks, didn't anyone
on this bus

664
00:42:48,183 --> 00:42:52,851
see where the colored man
with the little girl went?

665
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:58,856
Who's missing?

666
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:03,192
That white woman.

667
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:06,128
Very friendly with them.

668
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,829
Do you know her name?

669
00:43:07,831 --> 00:43:12,065
No, sir. Sort of skinny,
very blonde hair.

670
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:15,668
There's her suitcase.

671
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:22,073
Take off.

672
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:53,669
Where the hell have you been?

673
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:56,038
You made me miss my bus.

674
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,673
I never stole a car before.

675
00:43:58,675 --> 00:44:01,676
I think they checked
the bus for you.

676
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:36,474
She's out like a light.

677
00:44:36,476 --> 00:44:39,743
Of course,
she's had a long day.

678
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:53,889
It's o.K.
You can go faster now.

679
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,826
What is it?

680
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:00,294
40.

681
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,397
41, that's it.

682
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,767
Couldn't you steal a good car?

683
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:11,770
The one next to it
wouldn't even start.

684
00:45:11,772 --> 00:45:14,773
Where'd you go looking,
a repair shop?

685
00:45:19,112 --> 00:45:21,145
You're kidding me.

686
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:26,149
And you're flooring it?

687
00:45:34,158 --> 00:45:37,425
I wanted to buy
a car like this,

688
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:39,960
but ray wouldn't let me.

689
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:58,444
What are you doing?

690
00:45:58,446 --> 00:46:01,146
Come on. Out. You can
wave somebody down.

691
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:05,983
You don't want to
get mixed up in this.

692
00:46:05,985 --> 00:46:08,352
I'm not mixed up in anything.

693
00:46:08,354 --> 00:46:11,355
I didn't ask you
to get this car,

694
00:46:11,357 --> 00:46:13,390
but seeing as you did

695
00:46:13,392 --> 00:46:16,226
and you made me miss my bus...

696
00:46:16,228 --> 00:46:19,795
I didn't "get" this car,
I stole it.

697
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:21,696
That's a felony.

698
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,164
Well, it shouldn't be

699
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,299
if it can't go over 40.

700
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:27,000
And kidnapping.

701
00:46:27,002 --> 00:46:29,969
You've got the FBI
down on my ass!

702
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:32,237
You'll be an accessory
to kidnapping.

703
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:33,705
You want that?

704
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:37,008
I want to go to my
president's funeral!

705
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,843
What I want

706
00:46:38,845 --> 00:46:41,245
is to go to that rotunda

707
00:46:41,247 --> 00:46:43,180
and file past that coffin

708
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:44,814
and pay my respects.

709
00:46:44,816 --> 00:46:48,584
How can you think
of setting me down

710
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:50,519
in lord-knows-where

711
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:52,854
after all I've tried to do?

712
00:46:52,856 --> 00:46:53,988
You owe me.

713
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,389
Owe you! Jesus!

714
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:58,024
I know you're going
to Philadelphia.

715
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,026
I read your luggage tags.

716
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:01,660
It's on your way.

717
00:47:03,397 --> 00:47:06,398
When I saw you
bearing down on me

718
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,401
in that bus, I should have run.

719
00:47:09,403 --> 00:47:12,070
You feel sorry for some people.

720
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:13,104
Sorry for me!

721
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:15,873
They keep dogging you
and dogging you!

722
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:23,012
Look, this is not
going to work.

723
00:47:23,014 --> 00:47:25,347
You've got to get out.

724
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,216
I'm doing what's best for you.

725
00:47:29,218 --> 00:47:31,851
And it's for my own good.

726
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:34,119
I hate when I'm told that.

727
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:37,055
Sometimes they're right.
Come on. Out.

728
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:38,623
I know your name,

729
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:42,059
and I have just
memorized your face.

730
00:47:42,061 --> 00:47:44,361
The license plate on this car

731
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:47,364
has two 8s and a 2 in it.

732
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:49,632
You don't have a choice.

733
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:09,151
You can catch the
bus in Knoxville.

734
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:10,752
Thanks, but no thanks.

735
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,153
I ain't felony accessorizing

736
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:15,055
to sit in another damn bus.

737
00:48:37,277 --> 00:48:38,276
Mr. Hallett,

738
00:48:38,278 --> 00:48:41,012
we'd like to talk to you

739
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:43,247
about your wife.

740
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,592
<i>Noon, eastern time.</i>

741
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:59,595
<i>The casket will be carried</i>
<i>to the capitol...</i>

742
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,531
<i>Military drummers will</i>
<i>accompany naval personnel...</i>

743
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:06,100
Shut off the engine.

744
00:49:06,102 --> 00:49:07,701
<i>The president's widow...</i>

745
00:49:10,872 --> 00:49:13,906
Can you get it
to go any faster?

746
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:17,409
Well, I can try.

747
00:49:27,153 --> 00:49:31,288
They're taking him
to the capitol today.

748
00:49:34,259 --> 00:49:36,659
I guess folks from around here

749
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:39,061
will be up there already.

750
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,262
Why would that be?

751
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:44,898
It's less than a day's drive.

752
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,100
Well, he did a lot
for your people.

753
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:55,939
Take a look around, ma'am.

754
00:49:55,941 --> 00:49:58,574
Look like he done much here?

755
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,157
Jonell, now, you be careful!

756
00:50:27,336 --> 00:50:30,370
Man, I got no luck with cars.

757
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:32,105
Mm-hmm.

758
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:37,009
Yeah, well, there's bad
luck that you run from

759
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:42,280
and bad luck that you
bring along with you.

760
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:46,016
Hell, man.

761
00:50:46,018 --> 00:50:48,985
I only have to put up with her

762
00:50:48,987 --> 00:50:50,486
as far as Washington.

763
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:52,488
You must be crazy, man.

764
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,389
You got a white woman

765
00:50:54,391 --> 00:50:56,991
riding in your car around here.

766
00:50:56,993 --> 00:50:59,193
Have her ride in back.

767
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:02,196
Heh heh heh.
Well, that's an idea.

768
00:51:02,198 --> 00:51:04,364
As long as I have

769
00:51:04,366 --> 00:51:07,300
one of those wind-up windows

770
00:51:07,302 --> 00:51:10,369
because I tell you,
the bitch can talk.

771
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:13,038
Ha ha ha ha!

772
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,006
Ha ha ha!

773
00:51:15,008 --> 00:51:18,009
It's a wonder her name
ain't niagara falls.

774
00:51:18,011 --> 00:51:19,977
She runs like water.

775
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:21,511
Keeps running.

776
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,415
Busiest mouth I know.

777
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,016
Ha ha ha!

778
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,351
Quack, quack, quack.

779
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:43,397
Sure hope your luck changes.

780
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:45,732
Thanks, man.

781
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:56,241
Can we just go now, please?

782
00:52:07,753 --> 00:52:11,187
I thought the negroes
liked president Kennedy.

783
00:52:12,356 --> 00:52:13,955
Some did.

784
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:15,456
You didn't.

785
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,424
Nothing against the man.

786
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:21,427
I just don't expect much
from white folks.

787
00:52:24,198 --> 00:52:25,397
Oh.

788
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:27,232
I think that's
pretty prejudiced,

789
00:52:27,234 --> 00:52:30,401
if you don't mind my saying so.

790
00:52:30,403 --> 00:52:32,970
I don't mind.

791
00:52:58,294 --> 00:52:59,459
¶ There was a bird ¶

792
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:00,927

819
00:54:00,143 --> 00:54:01,976
ray hates to travel.

820
00:54:01,978 --> 00:54:06,113
He says it puts
too many Miles on the car.

821
00:54:06,115 --> 00:54:08,682
We went to Mexico once,

822
00:54:08,684 --> 00:54:11,651
but he's found the
center of the universe

823
00:54:11,653 --> 00:54:14,353
on the living room couch.

824
00:54:14,355 --> 00:54:17,689
That's the trouble marrying
someone you grow up with.

825
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:20,658
You think you know things
without asking him,

826
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,661
like, "is it o.K. If I work?"

827
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:25,295
Or, "without kids,

828
00:54:25,297 --> 00:54:27,297
"what do we talk about

829
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:29,499
for the rest of our lives?"

830
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:34,803
Or, "are you going to want
creamed corn<i> every</i> night?"

831
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,306
There you go.

832
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:40,907
Thank you.

833
00:54:44,312 --> 00:54:47,313
Why didn't you marry her?

834
00:54:52,686 --> 00:54:54,318
I asked her to,

835
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,220
but she knew I really
didn't want to.

836
00:54:57,222 --> 00:54:59,188
You didn't?

837
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:02,424
See, I was going
back to the service

838
00:55:02,426 --> 00:55:04,726
for the pharmacy
training program.

839
00:55:04,728 --> 00:55:07,729
Well, that's what
I have on my mind

840
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:10,364
when riva says she's pregnant.

841
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,700
Well...

842
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:18,704
I didn't even think
about being a husband,

843
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:20,338
never mind being...

844
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,006
Being a father.

845
00:55:23,342 --> 00:55:25,342
She knew that.

846
00:55:25,344 --> 00:55:26,910
And, uh...

847
00:55:26,912 --> 00:55:31,380
She turned me down and
went back home to Dallas.

848
00:55:31,382 --> 00:55:34,349
Didn't it kill you
knowing she was growing up

849
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:36,417
and you not seeing it?

850
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:39,720
I had other things on my mind.

851
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:41,722
Sure, I can see that.

852
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:43,023
Look,

853
00:55:43,025 --> 00:55:45,558
I'd do the same thing again.

854
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,426
It's crazy to think

855
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,728
if I hadn't let her go,

856
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,362
we'd all be together

857
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:53,030
and she'd be alive.

858
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:59,134
You got anybody now?

859
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,869
No.

860
00:56:02,972 --> 00:56:05,405
Good-looking man like you?

861
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:06,939
How come?

862
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:12,210
I just don't have anybody
right now, that's all.

863
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:17,380
Must be lonely.

864
00:56:23,454 --> 00:56:27,755
Anyhow, I think
she's the spit of you.

865
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,977
This looks like a good
spot, don't you think?

866
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:57,648
I'll cover you with this map.

867
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,450
I won't even look.

868
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:06,021
Honey, go on. No
one's going to see.

869
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,527
I'll go, too.

870
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:12,928
Watch.

871
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:17,365
Mr. Cater, would you go
around to the other side?

872
00:57:24,906 --> 00:57:26,772
Squat down.

873
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:32,143
Look at that here!

874
00:57:39,919 --> 00:57:41,919
How far is tazewell?

875
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:43,553
45 Miles, maybe.

876
00:57:43,555 --> 00:57:44,820
I know people there.

877
00:57:44,822 --> 00:57:46,588
Hazel's folks.

878
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,623
Hazel at the beauty parlor?

879
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,558
Tazewell, Virginia.
I remember now.

880
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,926
They could help us.

881
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:54,228
Why would they do that?

882
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,596
Why not?

883
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:57,564
Assassination or not,

884
00:57:57,566 --> 00:58:00,800
this country's full of
good, trusting people.

885
00:58:01,836 --> 00:58:05,604
Besides, we don't have
to tell them the truth.

886
00:58:36,368 --> 00:58:38,601
What's going on?

887
00:58:38,603 --> 00:58:39,802
Car trouble.

888
00:58:39,804 --> 00:58:43,172
Can we hitch a ride
with you into tazewell?

889
00:58:43,174 --> 00:58:45,440
What's your business with him?

890
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,376
Stand back, baby.

891
00:58:48,378 --> 00:58:51,679
He gave me a ride.

892
00:58:51,681 --> 00:58:54,448
Where you from, lady?

893
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:55,982
Much obliged, gentlemen,

894
00:58:55,984 --> 00:58:59,618
but I'm going to get
this car going quick.

895
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,986
Thank you anyway.

896
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:25,908
Can you fix it?

897
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:27,209
Maybe.

898
00:59:27,211 --> 00:59:28,843
You know what?

899
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:31,645
You'd get a ride up the road.

900
00:59:31,647 --> 00:59:34,714
Nobody's going to
pick up the three of us.

901
00:59:34,716 --> 00:59:36,649
Go on.

902
00:59:40,688 --> 00:59:41,853
Well...

903
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,359
I'll come back for you.

904
00:59:50,228 --> 00:59:51,527
You'll wait?

905
00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:53,829
Sure. We'll be right here.

906
00:59:56,667 --> 00:59:58,233
I'll be back.

907
01:00:07,677 --> 01:00:08,909
Can you help?

908
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:11,945
I need to hitch a ride
into tazewell.

909
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:13,546
Hop in.

910
01:00:13,548 --> 01:00:15,247
Thank you.

911
01:00:39,772 --> 01:00:41,471
Let's go, baby.

912
01:00:47,078 --> 01:00:49,945
Now, we've got to go on, o.K.?

913
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:53,714
You're going to be
a big girl about that?

914
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,916
You're going away, too, daddy?

915
01:01:03,725 --> 01:01:04,990
No, baby.

916
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:08,926
Daddy's going to be
right here with you.

917
01:01:10,729 --> 01:01:13,830
Daddy's never
going to go away again.

918
01:01:14,966 --> 01:01:16,598
Come here.

919
01:01:39,354 --> 01:01:42,822
Baby, get in here and lie down,

920
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:46,025
and don't look up,
no matter what.

921
01:01:46,027 --> 01:01:48,193
Don't look up.

922
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:24,693
Where's the woman?

923
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:27,162
She got a ride into town.

924
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:30,365
Where do you think
you're going, boy?

925
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:32,567
I don't want no trouble.

926
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:35,803
He don't want no trouble!

927
01:02:37,873 --> 01:02:39,572
Hold him! Hold him!

928
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,473
Ugh!

929
01:02:49,582 --> 01:02:50,581
Ugh!

930
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:51,882
Ah!

931
01:02:55,854 --> 01:02:57,920
Hello, Mrs. Enright?

932
01:02:59,023 --> 01:03:00,922
Hello?

933
01:03:03,192 --> 01:03:04,724
Who is it?

934
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:07,059
Mrs. Enright,
it's lurene hallett.

935
01:03:07,061 --> 01:03:09,394
I'm a friend of hazel's.

936
01:03:09,396 --> 01:03:10,928
I work in the shop.

937
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,729
Is it something with hazel?

938
01:03:12,731 --> 01:03:14,197
Oh, no, no.

939
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:17,200
I saw her Friday evening.
She's fine. I...

940
01:03:17,202 --> 01:03:18,701
Um...

941
01:03:18,703 --> 01:03:21,270
I'm just passing
through, and...

942
01:03:21,272 --> 01:03:24,839
you're the girl that lost
the baby, aren't you?

943
01:03:26,209 --> 01:03:29,910
Mrs. Enright, please,
can I use your phone?

944
01:03:34,215 --> 01:03:35,214
Yeah.

945
01:03:35,216 --> 01:03:36,949
Ray, honey, it's me.

946
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:38,116
Jesus, lurene!

947
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:41,085
Thank God!
Where the hell are you?

948
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:42,853
Ray, I'm fine, um...

949
01:03:42,855 --> 01:03:45,055
I'm in a real hurry.

950
01:03:45,057 --> 01:03:48,691
The FBI said some colored
guy grabbed you.

951
01:03:48,693 --> 01:03:50,859
That is not true.

952
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:53,862
I... I'm just hitching
a ride with him.

953
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:55,063
That's why...

954
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:56,230
you're hitching a ride?

955
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,233
He's going to drop
me in Washington.

956
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,935
What the hell is going on?

957
01:04:01,937 --> 01:04:03,469
What are you doing?

958
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:06,871
I'm going to the president's
funeral, what else?

959
01:04:06,873 --> 01:04:08,138
And...

960
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,273
And I was just wondering

961
01:04:10,275 --> 01:04:13,242
if you could get me
some money here?

962
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:15,744
Isn't there some way
to do that?

963
01:04:15,746 --> 01:04:18,246
You listen to me, Louise Irene.

964
01:04:18,248 --> 01:04:20,781
You call the police and run.

965
01:04:20,783 --> 01:04:23,049
They will hunt that nigra down.

966
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:24,917
Oh, for God's sake!

967
01:04:24,919 --> 01:04:26,285
You won't help? Fine!

968
01:04:26,287 --> 01:04:29,288
I was crazy to think you would.

969
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,256
I'll call from the motel.

970
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:32,390
What motel?

971
01:04:32,392 --> 01:04:34,392
Where we spent our honeymoon.

972
01:04:34,394 --> 01:04:36,594
Didn't you read my note?

973
01:04:36,596 --> 01:04:38,796
I read the goddamn note!

974
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:41,665
If you had come with me,

975
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:43,667
this wouldn't have happened.

976
01:04:43,669 --> 01:04:45,468
Get your ass back here,

977
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,403
or I swear to God,

978
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:48,804
I'm... I'm...

979
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:53,107
I'm going to take you to
some doctor for your head!

980
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:09,088
Is everything all right?

981
01:05:12,193 --> 01:05:15,160
Do you have a car?

982
01:05:44,222 --> 01:05:46,155
Mr. Cater!

983
01:05:47,158 --> 01:05:48,724
Jonell?

984
01:06:08,977 --> 01:06:11,377
Let me talk to her first.

985
01:06:11,379 --> 01:06:15,180
She didn't expect me back
till day after tomorrow.

986
01:06:16,683 --> 01:06:19,216
Mrs. Enright, it's me!

987
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:22,251
Well, lurene,

988
01:06:22,253 --> 01:06:24,987
did that car let you down?

989
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:26,254
Oh, no, no.

990
01:06:26,256 --> 01:06:29,257
Well, I'm glad you
changed your mind.

991
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:31,359
We don't get much company.

992
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:51,010
I'm Paul cater, ma'am.

993
01:06:51,012 --> 01:06:53,379
This is my daughter, jonell.

994
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:57,249
Come on in.

995
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:05,122
They're taking him from the
white house to the capitol.

996
01:07:05,124 --> 01:07:08,291
I don't want to
be any trouble, ma'am.

997
01:07:08,293 --> 01:07:10,259
Iodine and everything
for the doctor's

998
01:07:10,261 --> 01:07:13,395
in here in the front
room with Cal.

999
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:14,929
He don't speak much.

1000
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:17,399
That's where
the stroke got him,

1001
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:21,135
but he hears you
if you speak up.

1002
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,704
Where is the doctor's box, Cal?

1003
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,907
Maybe I can help find it.

1004
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:30,010
<i>Lee oswald is being</i>
<i>transferred...</i>

1005
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:33,146
Do you know my daughter,
too, Mr. Cater?

1006
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:36,549
No, ma'am. I'm not from Dallas.

1007
01:07:36,551 --> 01:07:37,716
This it?

1008
01:07:37,718 --> 01:07:40,018
<i>There is Lee oswald.</i>

1009
01:07:41,554 --> 01:07:44,221
<i>He's been shot! He's been shot!</i>

1010
01:07:44,223 --> 01:07:46,189
Oh, my God.

1011
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:48,524
<i>There's the man with the gun.</i>

1012
01:07:48,526 --> 01:07:50,526
<i>It's absolute panic</i>

1013
01:07:50,528 --> 01:07:54,162
<i>here in the basement of the
Dallas police headquarters.</i>

1014
01:07:54,164 --> 01:07:56,063
<i>Detectives have</i>
<i>their guns drawn.</i>

1015
01:07:56,065 --> 01:07:58,598
<i>Oswald has been shot.</i>

1016
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,434
<i>There is no question.</i>
<i>Oswald has been shot.</i>

1017
01:08:01,436 --> 01:08:03,769
<i>Pandemonium has broken loose.</i>

1018
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:06,171
<i>It is almost unbelievable.</i>

1019
01:08:06,173 --> 01:08:09,073
<i>It's almost unbelievable.</i>

1020
01:08:09,075 --> 01:08:14,177
<i>Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy is...</i>
<i>and her daughter...</i>

1021
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:17,446
<i>are walking up to the casket.</i>

1022
01:08:18,615 --> 01:08:23,384
<i>This will be her last good-bye</i>
<i>for today.</i>

1023
01:08:28,424 --> 01:08:31,191
<i>And now Mrs. Kennedy</i>
<i>and Caroline</i>

1024
01:08:31,193 --> 01:08:33,459
<i>are walking slowly</i>
<i>past the crowd,</i>

1025
01:08:33,461 --> 01:08:35,561
<i>past president and Mrs. Johnson</i>

1026
01:08:35,563 --> 01:08:38,063
<i>and the distinguished</i>
<i>members of congress</i>

1027
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:40,198
<i>and the late</i>
<i>president's cabinet,</i>

1028
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,400
<i>the justices</i>
<i>of the supreme court,</i>

1029
01:08:42,402 --> 01:08:45,269
<i>and Mrs. Kennedy</i>
<i>and her daughter</i>

1030
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:48,438
<i>leave the capitol rotunda,</i>
<i>leave the capitol building</i>

1031
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,207
<i>on their way back</i>
<i>to the white house.</i>

1032
01:08:51,209 --> 01:08:53,576
We better get you fixed up.

1033
01:08:53,578 --> 01:08:56,612
<i>The public will begin</i>
<i>filing past the casket.</i>

1034
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:02,584
I don't know when we
started killing people

1035
01:09:02,586 --> 01:09:04,218
to solve things.

1036
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,086
I didn't know we stopped.

1037
01:09:06,088 --> 01:09:08,421
Mr. Cater.

1038
01:09:11,092 --> 01:09:14,493
Would your daddy let you
come upstairs with me?

1039
01:09:14,495 --> 01:09:18,263
There's lots of my daughter's
old toys up there.

1040
01:09:23,103 --> 01:09:25,269
Thank you, ma'am.

1041
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:31,441
Do you like dolls?

1042
01:09:31,443 --> 01:09:35,444
I believe we can find
you a little girl.

1043
01:09:37,114 --> 01:09:40,481
I don't know how
Jackie's bearing up.

1044
01:09:46,522 --> 01:09:48,488
Well...

1045
01:09:51,259 --> 01:09:54,260
Sorry, it's going
to pull a little.

1046
01:09:54,262 --> 01:09:55,694
I can't help it.

1047
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:57,529
Oh...

1048
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:11,776
First time I saw her, she...

1049
01:10:13,112 --> 01:10:15,045
Kind of grabbed me.

1050
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:18,881
I'd be eating
and imagine her eating...

1051
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:20,949
Or sitting in the bathtub

1052
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:23,318
or just walking
down the street,

1053
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,521
and I'd think
of her doing that,

1054
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:30,324
and it would be o.K.

1055
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:33,360
Sometimes ray would
say something

1056
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:35,729
and I'd pretend it was Jack.

1057
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,164
It eased me, you know.

1058
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:44,169
See, I don't get ordinary life.

1059
01:10:44,171 --> 01:10:47,505
When I went to Mexico
that time with ray,

1060
01:10:47,507 --> 01:10:50,541
everyone was talking
Spanish, or Mexican.

1061
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:55,578
That's what the newspaper
and the signs were in.

1062
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:59,081
I loved him that weekend.
I almost felt that,

1063
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:02,350
because he wasn't
understanding it either,

1064
01:11:02,352 --> 01:11:07,521
and I thought,
"honey, now you know."

1065
01:11:13,195 --> 01:11:16,329
I guess you think I'm crazy.

1066
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:21,899
No, lurene, I don't think that.

1067
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:32,375
It's a policeman.

1068
01:11:38,616 --> 01:11:40,115
Mrs. Enright?

1069
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:43,584
Who's in here?

1070
01:11:43,586 --> 01:11:45,118
Hi!

1071
01:11:47,555 --> 01:11:49,187
Can I help you?

1072
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:50,555
Is Mrs. Enright in?

1073
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:52,223
She's upstairs lying down.

1074
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:55,593
I don't want to wake her.

1075
01:11:55,595 --> 01:11:58,562
Uh, well, we're looking
for a nigger, ma'am.

1076
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,597
He's kidnapped a little girl

1077
01:12:00,599 --> 01:12:02,198
and a white woman.

1078
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,633
A wh... a white woman?

1079
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:06,368
You sure?

1080
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:07,736
Yeah, FBI report.

1081
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:09,370
She's a Dallas woman.

1082
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:12,940
I got a name here somewhere.

1083
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:14,641
She tried to report him,

1084
01:12:14,643 --> 01:12:16,442
so he took her.

1085
01:12:16,444 --> 01:12:18,143
Oh.

1086
01:12:18,145 --> 01:12:19,544
Anyway, we're just hoping

1087
01:12:19,546 --> 01:12:21,279
we're not too late.

1088
01:12:21,281 --> 01:12:24,282
Oh, yeah, sure.

1089
01:12:24,284 --> 01:12:26,384
Well,

1090
01:12:26,386 --> 01:12:28,386
there ain't no niggers here.

1091
01:12:28,388 --> 01:12:30,755
He is in the area, ma'am.

1092
01:12:30,757 --> 01:12:33,290
The car he stole from Tennessee

1093
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:34,624
was found on 61.

1094
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:36,592
A farmer and his sons

1095
01:12:36,594 --> 01:12:38,393
tried to help him.

1096
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:40,261
Well, he nearly killed them.

1097
01:12:40,263 --> 01:12:41,829
Who's down there, child?

1098
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,999
Carl swinson, ma'am.

1099
01:12:47,102 --> 01:12:50,303
He pulled up here,
I said to myself,

1100
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:52,772
"Jackie, my God,
it's the police.

1101
01:12:52,774 --> 01:12:55,641
Something must have happened
back home in fredericksburg,"

1102
01:12:55,643 --> 01:12:57,676
but he's looking for niggers.

1103
01:12:57,678 --> 01:13:00,812
We ain't seen nothing
like that around here.

1104
01:13:00,814 --> 01:13:02,580
Ma'am, that true?

1105
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,420
If you're the swinson boy,

1106
01:13:10,422 --> 01:13:13,623
you know I can barely see.

1107
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:16,659
It's the same thing
your grandma had.

1108
01:13:16,661 --> 01:13:18,427
Now run along.

1109
01:13:18,429 --> 01:13:21,797
I'm so tired,
I'm fit to be laid up.

1110
01:13:21,799 --> 01:13:23,331
Thank you, ma'am.

1111
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,333
He probably went back South

1112
01:13:25,335 --> 01:13:27,702
to throw you off the track.

1113
01:13:27,704 --> 01:13:29,336
He won't get far.

1114
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,704
We got roadblocks

1115
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,338
in three counties.

1116
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,806
Miss.

1117
01:13:52,658 --> 01:13:54,457
Thank you, Mrs. Enright.

1118
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:56,725
I won't lie for you again.

1119
01:13:56,727 --> 01:13:58,493
They got it all wrong.

1120
01:13:58,495 --> 01:14:01,529
They'll have roadblocks
from Lebanon to bluefield.

1121
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:03,664
They'll be down
tomorrow morning.

1122
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:06,733
You and the child
can sleep in hazel's room.

1123
01:14:06,735 --> 01:14:09,469
Mr. Cater, sleep in the barn.

1124
01:14:09,471 --> 01:14:10,736
Thank you, ma'am.

1125
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,471
We'll be leaving tonight.

1126
01:14:12,473 --> 01:14:13,738
They got roadblocks.

1127
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,840
I'll just get my things.

1128
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:17,842
I'm sorry for the trouble.

1129
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:21,044
Let me fix the child
a meal first.

1130
01:14:27,351 --> 01:14:28,850
We'll be staying, ma'am,

1131
01:14:28,852 --> 01:14:33,053
and we really do appreciate
all you're doing for us.

1132
01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:50,769
We can't leave yet.
They're looking for you.

1133
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:52,504
I didn't mean you.

1134
01:14:52,506 --> 01:14:54,205
Just jonell and me.

1135
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:59,342
What about me?

1136
01:15:01,346 --> 01:15:02,878
You'll get to Washington.

1137
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,347
I'd bet my life on it.

1138
01:15:05,349 --> 01:15:08,083
What are you going to do?

1139
01:15:08,085 --> 01:15:10,185
Excuse me.

1140
01:15:12,522 --> 01:15:15,523
It's because I called
you nigger, isn't it?

1141
01:15:15,525 --> 01:15:17,892
I did that to fool him.

1142
01:15:17,894 --> 01:15:19,526
I didn't mean it.

1143
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:21,895
That's a load off my mind.

1144
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:24,898
Thank you
for not meaning nigger

1145
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,901
and for putting
the FBI on my ass

1146
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:30,904
and for bringing
those crackers down on me.

1147
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:33,539
Hey, baby,
thanks for that, too.

1148
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,207
Excuse me for not staying

1149
01:15:35,209 --> 01:15:37,742
for the next time you're sorry.

1150
01:15:37,744 --> 01:15:39,043
Stay for jonell's sake.

1151
01:15:39,045 --> 01:15:41,545
Think of what's best for her.

1152
01:15:41,547 --> 01:15:44,548
What's best for her
is not your business.

1153
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,450
It wasn't yours either
till a week ago.

1154
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:49,919
When you have a child,
you can judge me.

1155
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:52,454
Until then,
sit in your dream world

1156
01:15:52,456 --> 01:15:55,323
where the first lady
gives a fuck about you!

1157
01:15:55,325 --> 01:15:57,625
Go to hell!

1158
01:15:58,728 --> 01:16:01,395
I thought we
understood each other.

1159
01:16:01,397 --> 01:16:03,563
We're both running, aren't we?

1160
01:16:03,565 --> 01:16:05,565
We're both wanting
something more.

1161
01:16:05,567 --> 01:16:08,568
Don't you dare think
that we're the same.

1162
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:11,571
Being bored and being
black are different.

1163
01:16:11,573 --> 01:16:13,139
Do you hear that?

1164
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:16,442
Your life in Dallas, hell.

1165
01:16:16,444 --> 01:16:19,578
That's open air my child
may never breathe.

1166
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,846
Free to live where she wants,

1167
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:24,014
to drive north without hiding.

1168
01:16:24,016 --> 01:16:27,817
Free to grow up as bored,
stupid, or useless

1169
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:29,084
as any white woman.

1170
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:31,486
We are not the same!

1171
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:07,586
You did what you could for us.

1172
01:17:07,588 --> 01:17:08,987
I know that,

1173
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:12,090
but it's more harm
than good now.

1174
01:17:12,092 --> 01:17:13,991
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1175
01:17:13,993 --> 01:17:16,326
Don't.

1176
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:19,995
Everything's gone so wrong.

1177
01:17:19,997 --> 01:17:22,330
Shh.

1178
01:19:08,097 --> 01:19:11,198
That's the quietest
child I ever did see.

1179
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,099
Mrs. Enright.

1180
01:19:13,101 --> 01:19:16,502
She wouldn't let me bathe
her or tuck her in.

1181
01:19:16,504 --> 01:19:19,938
Do you know what you're
headin' for, child?

1182
01:19:22,108 --> 01:19:23,407
No.

1183
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,343
Then I feel sorry for you.

1184
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,878
Sorry for your husband, too.

1185
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,047
I'll expect you-all
to be out of here

1186
01:19:33,049 --> 01:19:35,049
as soon as it's light.

1187
01:19:36,218 --> 01:19:39,085
I'll bring the car back
day after tomorrow,

1188
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:41,520
if it's still all right.

1189
01:19:41,522 --> 01:19:44,022
That'll be fine.

1190
01:19:47,227 --> 01:19:50,861
Or you can drive it
on down to hazel.

1191
01:19:50,863 --> 01:19:53,230
It'll be hers
soon enough anyway.

1192
01:19:53,232 --> 01:19:56,066
No need for all that.

1193
01:19:56,068 --> 01:19:57,434
We'll leave now.

1194
01:19:57,436 --> 01:19:59,436
The child needs her sleep.

1195
01:19:59,438 --> 01:20:00,970
First light's soon enough.

1196
01:20:00,972 --> 01:20:04,073
It's that first room
upstairs on the right.

1197
01:20:04,075 --> 01:20:07,076
I left something clean
for you to wear...

1198
01:20:07,078 --> 01:20:09,044
one of hazel's old dresses.

1199
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,113
Good night, Mr. Cater.

1200
01:20:12,115 --> 01:20:14,381
Good night, Mrs. Enright.

1201
01:20:20,154 --> 01:20:22,087
Good night.

1202
01:20:23,156 --> 01:20:24,922
Good night.

1203
01:20:34,566 --> 01:20:40,101
<i>And Mrs. Kennedy steps forward</i>
<i>to light the eternal flame.</i>

1204
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:44,805
<i>Perhaps never</i>
<i>in the history of the world</i>

1205
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:48,408
<i>have so many of the world's</i>
<i>greats been gathered...</i>

1206
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,111
Yes, sir?

1207
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:53,512
Uh, name's ray hallett.

1208
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:54,779
Mm-hmm.

1209
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:57,314
My... my wife check in yet?

1210
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:10,026
Thank you, Mrs. Enright.

1211
01:21:29,512 --> 01:21:30,978
You forget something?

1212
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:46,324
Honey, I got to
stay here, o.K.?

1213
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:51,161
Give me a kiss good-bye.
Come on.

1214
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:56,865
What are you doing?

1215
01:21:56,867 --> 01:22:00,168
They'll be looking for three.
You're safer without me.

1216
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,202
Lurene.

1217
01:22:01,204 --> 01:22:04,338
I'll be o.K. With them
about the car.

1218
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:09,042
Uh... Just send me the money,
and I'll get it to hazel.

1219
01:22:18,052 --> 01:22:19,584
Bye.

1220
01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:49,668
I'll be right back.

1221
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,254
We're almost home.

1222
01:24:10,256 --> 01:24:12,289
We're almost home.

1223
01:24:49,393 --> 01:24:53,361
You realize what
kind of trouble you're in?

1224
01:24:55,164 --> 01:24:58,331
You want everyone
to read in the papers

1225
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:00,700
about you
and some colored fella?

1226
01:25:00,702 --> 01:25:03,202
Oh, ray! For God's sake!

1227
01:25:03,204 --> 01:25:05,837
Are you going to shoot me

1228
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:09,373
'cause I hitched a ride
with a colored man?

1229
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:11,808
No white people stopped, o.K.?

1230
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:15,344
I didn't know
what I'd find up here.

1231
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,312
Listen, honey,

1232
01:25:17,314 --> 01:25:20,514
we got to talk, I know.

1233
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:25,151
Right now, I have me
a real bad headache.

1234
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:28,053
Some beer and bufferin,
I'll be fine.

1235
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:30,422
You want to get me some?

1236
01:25:30,424 --> 01:25:32,157
What's out there?

1237
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:36,060
I'm just trying to see
if we have a view

1238
01:25:36,062 --> 01:25:38,028
of a monument or something.

1239
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:39,396
I'll get it myself.

1240
01:25:39,398 --> 01:25:41,831
Just stay here and simmer down.

1241
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:44,867
I'm not letting you
out of my sight!

1242
01:25:44,869 --> 01:25:46,335
Now, I know you, lurene!

1243
01:25:46,337 --> 01:25:48,003
We are going home,

1244
01:25:48,005 --> 01:25:51,406
and you're going to
listen to me.

1245
01:25:51,408 --> 01:25:54,409
You're damn lucky
you're not in jail already.

1246
01:25:54,411 --> 01:25:57,678
What's the difference between
jail and what we have?

1247
01:25:59,782 --> 01:26:01,848
No! Let me go!

1248
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:03,416
Oww!

1249
01:26:04,218 --> 01:26:06,451
Ow! Stop!

1250
01:26:10,389 --> 01:26:12,422
Let me out of here!

1251
01:26:12,424 --> 01:26:16,191
No! No! Let me go!

1252
01:26:17,561 --> 01:26:19,460
It's the night manager, sir.

1253
01:26:19,462 --> 01:26:21,195
Don't. Don't.

1254
01:26:21,197 --> 01:26:22,462
Don't.

1255
01:26:24,098 --> 01:26:26,064
Don't you say anything.

1256
01:26:30,403 --> 01:26:33,404
Excuse me, sir.
Is everything all right?

1257
01:26:33,406 --> 01:26:35,305
I heard some screaming.

1258
01:26:38,209 --> 01:26:40,576
Uh... Yeah.

1259
01:26:40,578 --> 01:26:42,477
It's, uh...

1260
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:44,212
It's just my wife.

1261
01:26:44,214 --> 01:26:47,281
She's upset because of
the president and all.

1262
01:26:47,283 --> 01:26:48,715
Of course.

1263
01:26:48,717 --> 01:26:51,317
Are you sure everything's o.K.?

1264
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:53,419
Everything's fine. Thank you.

1265
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:55,387
This is the guy.
This is the guy!

1266
01:26:55,389 --> 01:26:57,889
Paul, get out! Take the car!

1267
01:26:57,891 --> 01:27:00,091
Don't move!

1268
01:27:00,093 --> 01:27:01,425
Ray, please!

1269
01:27:01,427 --> 01:27:03,827
Jesus, lurene!

1270
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:07,663
What did he do to you?

1271
01:27:07,665 --> 01:27:10,666
Do you think
I'd let him touch me?

1272
01:27:10,668 --> 01:27:13,235
He gave me a lift!

1273
01:27:13,237 --> 01:27:15,604
If you don't let him go,

1274
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:19,507
they'll say I took up
with a colored man.

1275
01:27:19,509 --> 01:27:23,143
You said it yourself.
The papers will say it.

1276
01:27:23,145 --> 01:27:25,612
I couldn't hold my head up.

1277
01:27:25,614 --> 01:27:28,848
You shoot him,
might as well shoot me.

1278
01:27:30,251 --> 01:27:31,683
You're lying.

1279
01:27:31,685 --> 01:27:34,352
I wouldn't! Not about this!

1280
01:27:34,354 --> 01:27:36,754
Ray, ray. He never touched me.

1281
01:27:36,756 --> 01:27:40,490
I felt sorry for
the little girl, is all.

1282
01:27:40,492 --> 01:27:42,425
Ray...

1283
01:27:42,427 --> 01:27:44,427
I'll go with you.

1284
01:27:44,429 --> 01:27:46,362
Let him go.

1285
01:27:46,364 --> 01:27:49,264
I'll go back to Dallas
with you tonight.

1286
01:27:49,266 --> 01:27:50,665
O.K., honey?

1287
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:52,667
I give you my word.

1288
01:27:52,669 --> 01:27:56,370
Let this nigger go back
to where he came from.

1289
01:27:56,372 --> 01:27:58,705

1290
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:02,142

1292
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,046
Ow!

1293
01:28:23,397 --> 01:28:24,996

1395
01:37:32,423 --> 01:37:34,756
I'll wait.

1396
01:37:36,626 --> 01:37:38,926

1402
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,039

1403
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:57,374

in port Arthur now,

1411
01:38:18,093 --> 01:38:19,459
has a girl friend.

1412
01:38:19,461 --> 01:38:20,960
Oh.

1413
01:38:20,962 --> 01:38:22,094

1415

1417
01:38:34,573 --> 01:38:35,872
Well, uh...

1418
01:38:35,874 --> 01:38:38,841
I lie about it, Paul, you know,

1419
01:38:38,843 --> 01:38:42,044
to the police, those
people in there, everyone.

1420
01:38:42,046 --> 01:38:44,613
I just want you to know...

1421
01:38:44,615 --> 01:38:47,115
I've never been sorry.

1422
01:38:47,117 --> 01:38:48,716
Never.

1423
01:38:51,587 --> 01:38:53,853
I'm the same.
