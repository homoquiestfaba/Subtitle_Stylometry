PENNY: Uncle Gadget?
Is this tr.ue?

361
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:13,247
They're giving the Claw case
to this G2 character?

362
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:15,950
For the time being,
but don't worry, Penny...

363
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,487
I'm being reassigned to
another high-profile case.

364
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:21,789
What could be more
high-profile than Claw?

365
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,124
It's top secret, Penny.

366
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:27,361
So top secret that
they haven't even told me yet.

367
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,096
PENNY: Hmm.

368
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:30,798
So, what are you making?

369
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,467
I'm just making
your favorite dessert.

370
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,970
Apple crumb cake
with raisin cinnamon icing...

371
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,638
and coconut sprinkles?

372
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:40,308
OK, I'm making your
second favorite dessert...

373
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,810
Iemon pudding.

374
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,146
So, since

you're off the case...

375
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:48,382
you wouldn't want to see
this clue I found about Claw.

376
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:50,251
Clue claw?
I mean, a Claw clue?

377
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:52,053
Is it a clue about Claw?

378
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,180
Take a look
at today's classifieds.

379
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:56,850

380
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,664

381

"Call 555-01 39
for appointment."

382
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:10,604
I've already got a job,
Penny, but thanks.

383
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:12,106
No, I checked the number...

384
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:14,141
and it's for a bar called
"The Blue Monkey."

385
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:15,576
You know what this means?

386
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:16,911
Hmm.

387
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:19,113
Uncle Gadget,
if you go to The Blue Monkey...

388
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:21,115
I bet it will
lead you right to Claw.

389
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,684
You can get back on the case
and get a jump on G2.

390
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:26,520
You know, Penny,
if I went to The Blue Monkey...

391
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,289
it might just lead me to Claw.

392
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:31,258
Then I could get back on
the case and get the jump on G2.

393
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:32,727
That's what I was just saying.

394
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:36,497
Did you? I guess
great minds think alike.

395
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:38,466
So, we'll leave

right after dinner?

396
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,868
No. Nope.
I'm sorry, Penny...

397
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:43,371
but this is official
police business only.

398
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:46,640
You gotta let me come with you.
I can help you.

399
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,909
Penny,
this is no place for a kid.

400
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:52,436
I'm not just a kid,
Uncle Gadget.

401
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:57,685
Of course not.
You're a very special kid.

402
00:18:57,685 --> 00:19:01,622
But there's more to being
a detective than being smart.

403
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:03,624
It takes a sharp eye...

404
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:05,726
for every detail,
every little nuance.

00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:08,095

Think about it.

539
00:25:18,438 --> 00:25:20,674
No, really.
You can't arrest me.

540
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:22,676
I'm one of the good guys.
Really, I am.

541
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:24,711
Hold on. She's with me.

542
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,581
What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

543
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:30,750
Never mind that.
Look what I found about Claw.

544
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,019
McKlBLE: Dr. Claw's pulling
a little heist tomorrow night...

545
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:35,956
at the Concentrated
lndustries warehouse.

546
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:38,258
Wowsers!
We'll have to have a stakeout.

547
00:25:38,258 --> 00:25:40,393
You mean,

I'll have to have a stakeout.

548
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:42,796
This is our case, lady.

549
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:44,030
Penny.

550
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,333
I know.
You told me to stay out of it...

551
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,435
but I did find you this clue.

552
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:51,771
Penny, I know you want
to be a detective.

553
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:54,241
But this following me
around all the time...

554
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:56,877
just isn't going to fly.

555
00:25:56,877 --> 00:25:58,812
Oh!

556
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:00,046

558
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:04,114
Hi, Chief.

559
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,956
Gadget, what are you doing
in a barroom brawl?

560
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:11,658
Looking for Clue claws.

561
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:13,727

clue about Claw.

562
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,396
And I was right.
We got a valuable lead.

563
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:17,731
Yeah, a very valuable lead.

564
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:19,466
We have evidence
of a possible heist...

565
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:22,302
at Concentrated lndustries
warehouse tomorrow night.

566
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:23,670
Great work, G2!

567
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,772
Stake it out
and catch him red-handed.

568
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:28,275
GADGET: Fantastic.
I'll bring the doughnuts.

569
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:31,144
I already told you.
You're off this case.

570
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:33,647
Both you and Nancy Drew here.

571
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,316
Hey! Pbbt!

572
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:39,753
And you're off the force,
too, if you get within...

573
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:41,087
as a hundred yards
of that stakeout.

574
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:43,023
Fine, but if Claw gets away
with his plan...

575
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:45,692
for world domination,

don't come crying to us.

576
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:48,862
Remember, Gadget--100 yards!

577

00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:58,672
I'm at the stakeout...

580
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:01,374
but I haven't violated
the chief's orders.

581
00:27:01,374 --> 00:27:03,276
See? At the stakeout...

582
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:04,811
not at the stakeout.

583
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:06,813
Stakeout...
not at the stakeout.

584
00:27:06,813 --> 00:27:09,049
I don't think the chief
will see it that way.

You're tricked out with
more extras than the Batmobile.

598
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:47,754
Just show her that
it's all good under the hood.

599

I have no idea
what you just said...

600
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:51,257
but I'm sure
that if I were a car...

601
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:52,826
it would have been very helpful.

602
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:54,694
All I'm saying is,
you got to show her...

603
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:56,329
you got what it takes, man.

604
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:59,093
