1
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,130
George, wake up.

2
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:54,005
It's Saturday.

3
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:57,912
I know, but it's the first day of soccer.
It's our first game.

4
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:59,209
Soccer?

5
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:03,551
I can't today. I caught a cold while sleeping.

6
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:06,885
You'll be fine.

7
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,392
Come on, come on, it'll be great.

8
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,630
We're going to play like Brazilians.

9
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:22,163
-Here you go.
-Thanks, Mom.

10
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,470
Stuart, don't forget your water bottle.
George....

11
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,271
Don't forget your cleats.

12
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,705
You look especially beautiful today.

13
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:31,475
Some people just know how to wear oatmeal.

14
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:33,047
Okay, open up.

15
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,483
Did you hear that? She said "blah-blah."

16
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:39,350
I can't believe it.

17
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:40,954
Her first word.

18
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:44,723
Where's the baby book? I'm writing it down.

19
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:47,157
I'm not sure that's technically a word.

20
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,892
Of course it is.

21
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:53,335
But your Uncle Crenshaw says
that every Little starts talking by nine months.

22
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:55,565
In Uncle Crenshaw's case, never stops.

23
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,574
Are you both coming to the game?

24
00:03:57,642 --> 00:03:59,007
Wouldn't miss it.

25
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:00,908
Frederick...

26
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,979
...this soccer game's making me very....

27
00:04:04,148 --> 00:04:07,311
-Proud?
-Anxious. Especially about....

28
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,214
-I'm fine.
-He's fine.

29
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:18,556
All those boys stomping around with cleats.
What if someone....

30
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,788
Oh, honey. He's a Little.
All Littles are natural athletes.

31
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:24,763
-Do you need....
-Could you?

32
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:31,965
Okay, that's it for you.

33
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,305
Snow, food.

34
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,548
Food? Is it tuna? Or herring?

35
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:41,307
Or, dare I say it, is it lox?

36
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,352
Oh! Please be lox!

37
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,187
That's for you.

38
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:51,384
-Boys, are we ready to play some soccer?
-You bet, Dad.

39
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,256
Oh, great. It's glop.

40
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:58,334
Look what I'm reduced to.
I'm a Handi Wipe with hair.

41
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:08,976
Wallace! Get up! There we go!

42
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:13,642
That's right! Dig! Dig!
Go downfield! Downfield!

43
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:15,978
You guys, spread out! Spread out!

44
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:30,959
Well, George is getting a workout.

45
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:35,329
What bothers me is that every kid
has had a chance to play except Stuart.

46
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:36,839
There's plenty of time.

47
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:39,239
Plenty of time? There's 40 seconds.

48
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,379
He did an excellent job
of handing out the orange slices.

49
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:44,437
That's not as easy as it looks.

50
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:48,477
Okay, I'm glad he's not in the game.
I don't want him to get hurt.

51
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:51,043
It's Pee-Wee soccer. Nobody gets hurt.

52
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:58,725
Irwin, are you okay?

53
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:00,495
Are you all right, Irwin?

54
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:01,826
Do I look all right?

55
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,628
Here. Come on.

56
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:08,738
Better substitute.

57
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:11,238
Tie game. We could play with just 10.

58
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,570
But we have George, so it's like having nine.

59
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,077
We'll have none of that.

60
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:17,171
Come on, coach.

61
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:20,382
Stuart! Go in for Irwin!

62
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:23,610
Mom! Dad! I'm going in!

63
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:24,980
Yeah, Stuart!

64
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:26,114
Oh, dear.

65
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,222
Watch your tail out there.

66
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:34,591
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

67
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,030
Now, go get them.

68
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:44,671
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

69
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,707
Over here! I'm open!

70
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:51,437
I got it! I got it!

71
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:54,607
-I'm going to snatch him off the field.
-Honey, honey.

72
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,811
Knowing boys as I do,
I think he might find that a little....

73
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,219
Embarrassing.

74
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:08,922
Get it, George!

75
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:10,958
Go after it!

76
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:13,868
Pass me the ball, lame-o. Come on.

77
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,932
George, shoot!

78
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:18,431
I got it! I got it!

79
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:19,836
Shoot!

80
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,571
I got it! I got it!

81
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:36,757
Yeah, I did it!

82
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:49,432
I have to start wearing a cup.

83
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,037
He just looked so small out there.

84
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:59,947
So lacking in bigness.
Does he really have to go back next week?

85
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,381
We have to give him room to grow.

86
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:05,147
I do. I let him slice his own banana.

87
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,482
With a spoon.

88
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:09,822
I let him drive his car to school.
No other mother does that.

89
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:12,761
With George walking beside him
every step of the way.

90
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,128
How much more room should I give him?

91
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,099
A bit more than you're giving him now.

92
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:33,608
Maybe Mom was right.
Maybe I shouldn't be playing soccer anymore.

93
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,182
What does she want you to go out for?

94
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:38,084
Painting or dancing.

95
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:40,953
I guess it's my fault.

96
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,727
I'm sorry I kicked you into the goal.

97
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:47,355
That's okay. You won the game.
That's the main thing.

98
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:51,625
No. The main thing is I hit Wallace in the face.

99
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:32,105
Bogeys, 12:00! I got him, Brooklyn!

100
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:36,439
Wouldn't it be cool if I actually flew this?

101
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,947
Yeah. There's only one problem.

102
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:41,646
Mom.

103
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:44,211
-Hello, Mrs. Little.
-Hi, Will.

104
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:46,415
-ls George home?
-He's with Stuart.

105
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:49,683
We just need to tighten her up
and she's ready to fly.

106
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,385
Hi, George. Hi, Stuart.

107
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:52,759
Hi, Will.

108
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,797
You want to take a break for a while?
I brought my PS2.

109
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:56,992
Yeah, okay.

110
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,930
But what about the plane?

111
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:02,200
I want to play with Will for a while.
Play with Snowbell.

112
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:19,483
Oh, well. Guess I'll have to finish it myself.

113
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:30,364
If I can just....

114
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:35,962
Oh, dear.

115
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,077
Hey, what's that noise?

116
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,942
Sounds like a lawnmower.

117
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,947
Inside the house?

118
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,351
Stuart!

119
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:01,525
What are you doing?

120
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:03,361
I'm not doing anything!

121
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:05,161
Pull the brake!

122
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:12,903
Get the book!

123
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,776
This is cool.
All my brother does is jam crayons up his nose.

124
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:20,278
It says, "On takeoff, pull back on the throttle."

125
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:22,213
Takeoff? I'm in the air!

126
00:11:27,324 --> 00:11:29,815
Snowbell, get out of the way!

127
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,788
Please, don't hurt me!

128
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:34,790
What's going on?

129
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:36,992
Stuart's just flying in the house.

130
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:39,128
Flying in the house?

131
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:41,797
At least he's indoors, nothing bad can happen.

132
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:42,964
Watch out!

133
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,368
Hit the dirt!

134
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:48,672
Stuart!

135
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:57,045
Duck!

136
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:12,894
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

137
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,835
I'm okay.

138
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:16,370
Everything's fine.

139
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:20,602
Fine? Stuart, you destroyed it.

140
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:23,836
I'm sorry I wrecked it, George.

141
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:28,951
I'm sure we can fix it with some glue.

142
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,246
No, we can't. That's going in the trash.
It's much too dangerous.

143
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:31,948
Thanks, Stuart.

144
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:43,293
Why don't you take the boys home?
I think Stuart and I need to have a talk.

145
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,866
Good idea.

146
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:48,170
Come on, boys. Let's go home.

147
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:50,663
She treats me like a baby.

148
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,603
I'll fix you both some lunch.

149
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:58,177
She just loves you so much.
It's hard for her to think ofyou in danger.

150
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,341
Oh, this has been a bad day.

151
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:03,351
Mom's mad, George won't play with me....

152
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:08,122
I know. But every cloud has a silver lining.

153
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,587
Doesn't that make them kind of heavy?

154
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:13,562
No, it's an expression, Stuart.

155
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,191
The thing about being a Little is
that you can look at any situation...

156
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,326
...no matter how bleak, how hopeless...

157
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:22,861
...and still see the bright side. The silver lining.

158
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:29,338
Like in this situation,
the silver lining would be....

159
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:32,311
Help me, Dad, because I'm struggling.

160
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,986
George has found a newfriend.
So you could find a newfriend, too.

161
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:39,246
You're a lot better at this than I am.

162
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,120
I've been a Little a lot longer than you have.
You'll get the hang of it.

163
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:46,856
Meantime, keep your chin up...

164
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,193
...your back straight and your heart open.

165
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,393
-Then what?
-One step at a time.

166
00:13:56,673 --> 00:14:01,337
And Canada is separate
from the United States because...

167
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:04,504
...Canadians like to be alone.

168
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,979
Review tomorrow, test on Friday.

169
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,142
And please take your leftover lunches with you.

170
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,812
My husband is tired of me coming home
smelling like salami.

171
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:17,256
Tony, would you like to come over
to my house this afternoon?

172
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:19,659
Sorry, pal. I've got karate.

173
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:21,089
Hey, Mark.

174
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:23,029
Guitar lessons.

175
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:50,352
Some of the guys are going over to Will's house
to play basketball.

176
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:51,519
Can I come?

177
00:14:51,595 --> 00:14:54,086
They didn't exactly mention
that you were invited.

178
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:57,797
Oh, that's okay. I'm busy anyway.

179
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,129
Just tell Mom I walked you home.

180
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,962
I owe you one.

181
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:04,704
Sure.

182
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:27,655
Whoa!

183
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,533
Miss?

184
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,200
Miss?

185
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:40,400
Are you alive?

186
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:44,307
She's alive.

187
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:46,375
Out of the way, please.
Injured bird coming through!

188
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:54,981
What's going on?

189
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,123
My wing.

190
00:15:57,294 --> 00:16:00,286
Where am I? Hey! Where's the falcon?

191
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:01,624
What falcon?

192
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:06,163
That falcon! Drive! Get out of here!

193
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:07,963
Oh, my!

194
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:10,302
Get lost, you disgusting vulture!

195
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:15,677
Eat my feathers, you vile buzzard!

196
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:18,078
Do we really want to antagonize him?

197
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:23,946
Oh, boy, we've got a problem.

198
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:26,385
No, you can make it. Don't slow down.

199
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,431
You did it.

200
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:43,435
Yeah. I did.

201
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:46,132
So, who do I have to thank?

202
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:50,206
Forgive me. My name is Stuart. Stuart Little.

203
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,009
I'm Margalo. Just Margalo.

204
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:56,417
Margalo.

205
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:03,190
You're so strong. Are you an athlete?

206
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,191
Well, yeah.

207
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,360
I play a little soccer...

208
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:09,131
...fly airplanes...

209
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,461
...race boats.

210
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:15,027
You can put me down now.
My legs are fine. It's my wing that's hurt.

211
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:19,039
Oh. Yeah. Of course.

212
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,576
There used to be bandages in here.

213
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:30,910
-Hey, why don't we try your scarf?
-Good idea.

214
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:35,885
My pin, it's....

215
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:40,559
Must have happened
when that falcon smashed into me.

216
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:44,790
It was part of our nest when I was a baby.
I've had it my whole life.

217
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:47,832
It's the only thing I have left of my mother's.

218
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:50,199
Gee, that's too bad.

219
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,930
Yeah.

220
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,972
There. How's that?

221
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:02,346
That's much better, thank you.

222
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:05,544
So tell me, Stuart Little,
do you actually live here?

223
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:08,724
Oh, yeah. I'm a real Little. I'm the middle child.

224
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:10,392
The middle Little.

225
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:11,583
Cute.

226
00:18:11,928 --> 00:18:13,759
So, where do you live?

227
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:18,834
-You know, here and there.
-You mean you don't have a home?

228
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:21,961
Once, we lived in a box. Well, not really a box.

229
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:25,540
It was one of those things
where people keep their jewelry.

230
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:26,801
A jewelry box?

231
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:29,903
Yes! That's what it must have been.
A jewelry box.

232
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,414
It was wonderful.

233
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,678
Well, I've taken too much of your time.
I'd better go before it gets dark.

234
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:42,552
No, wait. You can't go out there.
Not while you're hurt. You should stay here.

235
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,786
I couldn't impose.
I mean, you'd really do that for me?

236
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:49,793
Sure, I have just the thing. I'll be right back.

237
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,869
-Meanwhile, you can use my cat's bed.
-You have a cat?

238
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:56,531
Don't worry about Snowbell.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

239
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:05,748
Those flies really come back on you.

240
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:15,685
I try to eat right and yet I still feel bloated.

241
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,924
Maybe more food will help.

242
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:21,753
Hi there.

243
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:25,467
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you!

244
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:28,297
Scare me? That's a laugh.

245
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,739
Hear that? That was a laugh.

246
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:40,310
Hairball. Major hairball.

247
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:44,715
And yet we continue to lick ourselves.
Unbelievable.

248
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:48,447
Hey, Snowbell. Meet Margalo.
She'll be staying with us for a while.

249
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,686
Staying? Are you out of your mind?

250
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:55,663
You can't just drag stray birds in here.
Do you think this is a halfway house?

251
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,366
Look, she's filthy.

252
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,958
No offense. She could have germs.

253
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:04,469
And how do you know she's not a vagrant
or a thief? Get rid of her.

254
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:06,404
We're home. Sorry we're late.

255
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,309
-Little hi, Little low.
-Little hey, Little ho.

256
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,173
What the heck was that?

257
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:14,143
That's just how we greet each other.

258
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:15,477
Interesting.

259
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:18,916
Nauseating is more like it.
You're in for it now, missy.

260
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,456
Mother Little hates when animals
walk in here off the street.

261
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:26,119
When she sees this, she's going to throw a fit.

262
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:34,596
Such a pretty little birdie.

263
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:38,330
Maybe it's just my friends she hates.

264
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:42,476
-I found her.
-Found me? He saved my life.

265
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,911
He did?

266
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,015
-From a falcon.
-What's that?

267
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,313
Stuart saved this little bird from a falcon.

268
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:52,080
A falcon? They are fierce creatures.

269
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:55,784
Why does the city have falcons?
That shouldn't be allowed. Write a letter.

270
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:59,727
On the other hand, we have a hero here.
Way to go, Stuart.

271
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:01,957
-Hey, Dad.
-What?

272
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:03,793
Silver lining.

273
00:21:06,303 --> 00:21:07,793
It's a guy thing.

274
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:09,097
Is it?

275
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:12,973
Isn't it nice that Stuart has a friend?

276
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:15,941
I don't think Stuart thinks of her as a friend.

277
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:19,582
-What do you mean?
-I mean he's smitten.

278
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:22,309
He's infatuated. He's bedazzled.

279
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:25,086
But he's a baby.

280
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:28,122
Boys start having crushes really young.

281
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,657
Frederick, did you have many crushes?

282
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:36,660
I'm still having one.

283
00:21:42,706 --> 00:21:45,368
So, Margalo, can I get you anything else?

284
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:48,408
Whip you up an omelet? Pop you a tart?

285
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:50,239
Stuart, I'm full.

286
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,476
Full? You eat like a bird.

287
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:56,882
Come on, Stuart, time for school.

288
00:21:56,953 --> 00:22:00,684
I'm not going to school.
I'm staying home to take care of Margalo.

289
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:04,959
Guess again. You are going to school,
and I'll take care of Margalo.

290
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:06,689
Look both ways crossing the street...

291
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:09,493
...wear galoshes and, in art class,
don't run with scissors.

292
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:11,193
I'll get your backpack.

293
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:15,231
Mothers.... You know.

294
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:18,564
-Well, I don't really know.
-No?

295
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:22,239
See, my mom just kind of one day...

296
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:24,436
...wasn't there anymore.

297
00:22:25,682 --> 00:22:28,583
So you've been completely
on your own all your life?

298
00:22:28,752 --> 00:22:31,778
-You bet.
-I'll bet it's been scary.

299
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:33,985
No, it's been an adventure.

300
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:36,355
I wish I had some adventures.

301
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:38,556
I'm only allowed to paint.

302
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:43,562
Hey, life is an adventure.
Just walking out that door is an adventure.

303
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:45,724
Come on, Stu. We're late.

304
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:52,537
Go for it, kid.

305
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:54,300
The adventure begins.

306
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,112
That feels like enough adventure for one day.

307
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,887
Hey, look! The Yankees won.

308
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,885
There we go.

309
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:12,718
Can you say, "Walk with Mommy"?

310
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,227
"Mommy"?

311
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:15,987
"Walk"?

312
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:19,057
Nothing.

313
00:23:30,914 --> 00:23:33,974
Martha and I are going out for a bit.
Can I bring you anything?

314
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,310
No, thanks.

315
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,752
Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."

316
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:40,984
Say, "Bye-bye." Martha. Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."

317
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:56,261
Fresh air.

318
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:08,579
Remember me?

319
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:10,118
You scared me.

320
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:12,882
What can I say? I'm a scary guy.

321
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:18,151
So, Margalo, you case the joint?
Any valuables? Come on, thrill me. Chill me.

322
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:21,925
They ain't got much.
The mom's got a ring, but it's only two carats.

323
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:23,259
All right, fine.

324
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:28,370
What else have they got?

325
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:30,234
Well, you know, not that much.
I mean, they mostly just have each other.

326
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:32,666
A moment while I vomit.

327
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:34,710
Why don't we just try somewhere else?

328
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,074
Because you're set up here.

329
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:38,410
They trust you. They like you.

330
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:42,113
And maybe...

331
00:24:42,318 --> 00:24:44,411
...you like them.

332
00:24:46,156 --> 00:24:47,714
Hey, Margalo, come on.

333
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:49,657
Don't con a conman.

334
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:52,589
Nobody else ever invited me to live with them.

335
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:55,892
Oh, really? Who found a pitiful orphan bird...

336
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,363
...and plucked her out of the gutter?

337
00:24:58,434 --> 00:25:00,163
Who shared his food with her...

338
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:03,603
...and, I hasten to add,
taught her a trade? Who?

339
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:06,569
-You did.
-I did. Right.

340
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:11,736
Well, then, straighten up and fly right.
And remember, you are here on business.

341
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:13,939
You're not here to play around.

342
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:19,715
Come on, Falcon!
When I'm on a job, I never play around!

343
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,809
Are you cold?

344
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:03,084
I guess when the weather gets too cold,
you'll just fly south for the winter?

345
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,922
Well, to tell you the truth, I've never flown south.

346
00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:09,621
It's kind of a dream of mine.

347
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:13,095
Get out of this cold, windy city,
catch that jet stream....

348
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:18,173
Fruit trees, millions of new birds to meet.

349
00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:21,004
-I hear it's paradise.
-Then how come you haven't gone?

350
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:25,111
Something's always stopping me.

351
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:27,875
Something's always stopping me, too.

352
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,215
Everybody around here thinks
I'm too small to accomplish anything.

353
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:35,121
Hey, the way I see it, you're as big as you feel.

354
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:38,089
Yeah. Boy, I'm really glad you fell into my car.

355
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:43,121
I mean, you know....
I mean I'm not glad you fell. I just....

356
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,130
Want some more popcorn?

357
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:46,932
Okay.

358
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,132
What?

359
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,275
My pin.

360
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,805
It's fixed. How--

361
00:27:56,012 --> 00:27:59,379
On my way home from school,
I drive right past where you crashed.

362
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:01,007
It was no big deal.

363
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,945
I mean, there was finding it...

364
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:06,284
...figuring out how the pieces fit together...

365
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:08,547
...and you know, fixing it.

366
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:11,150
And no big deal. Just...

367
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:12,387
Oh, Scottie.

368
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:15,193
...one, two, three.

369
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:21,203
Good as new.

370
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:26,607
No, Stuart, it's not.

371
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:30,603
It's much, much better.

372
00:28:31,214 --> 00:28:33,876
-Stay with me.
-All the time.

373
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:05,146
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

374
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:07,111
What are you talking about?

375
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm talking about you
and your little mouse friend.

376
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:17,187
Big mistake! Never make a friend I can eat.

377
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,691
Now, get me that ring!

378
00:29:19,962 --> 00:29:23,489
Or the mouse is lunch.

379
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:40,675
-I'll do the dishes.
-You did them last night.

380
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,011
For you, I'd do dishes every night.

381
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:50,982
That way, I don't have to change the baby.

382
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,862
She just dropped her dolly.

383
00:30:00,503 --> 00:30:01,663
I'll just--

384
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,905
-Frederick!
-What?

385
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,101
-My ring. It's gone.
-What do you mean?

386
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:09,667
It's gone!

387
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:11,642
-Are you absolutely....
-Positive.

388
00:30:11,714 --> 00:30:13,204
Unless....

389
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,342
I'll call the plumber!

390
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:19,380
What's going on?

391
00:30:19,455 --> 00:30:22,947
Mom's ring went down the drain. I can't reach it.

392
00:30:23,192 --> 00:30:24,955
Hey! What about me?

393
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,618
I can do it. Let me go, Dad.

394
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:29,956
-Go where?
-Down the drain.

395
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:33,191
I can bring it back up. It's an adventure.

396
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:35,860
I don't know. It's awfully dark down there.

397
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,903
And smelly. And cold.

398
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:42,066
But it's Mom's ring. She loves that ring.

399
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:45,370
Come on, Dad. Let me try.

400
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:09,661
Now, if it gets too cold, or too scary...

401
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,136
...you just tell us.

402
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:13,903
Don't worry, Dad. I can handle it.

403
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:19,473
-Or yank on the string, we'll pull you up.
-Will do.

404
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:27,086
How's it so far?

405
00:31:27,256 --> 00:31:30,589
Wet. There's a lot of slimy stuff
all over the walls.

406
00:31:30,893 --> 00:31:34,226
-What does it look like?
-Like the inside of your nose.

407
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,591
-Can you see the bottom yet?
-No, just more pipe.

408
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:42,237
And everything we ate for dinner last week.

409
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:44,771
And the pipe seems to go on and on.

410
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:46,871
Well, the plumber said....

411
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:48,840
What's going on?

412
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,310
Is that a new top?

413
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:55,948
You know, you have such taste.
Simple elegance is what I call it.

414
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:57,881
What's on the other end of that string?

415
00:31:57,954 --> 00:31:59,353
-This string?
-Yes.

416
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:04,058
Well, now, don't get excited,
but someone that you and I love...

417
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,723
...has volunteered to go down the drain
to get your ring.

418
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,895
-Stuart?
-Good guess, Mom.

419
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,862
You let our son go down the kitchen drain?

420
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:14,900
Now, Eleanor, don't be upset.

421
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:19,303
It's been well thought out.
If there's a problem, I pull on the string and....

422
00:32:21,043 --> 00:32:22,567
Now you can be upset.

423
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:24,774
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

424
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:27,441
Hurry! I'm slipping.

425
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:29,712
-Get more string.
-Great.

426
00:32:30,553 --> 00:32:32,043
There must be string here.

427
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:35,113
-There is no more.
-What else can we use?

428
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:36,816
-Spaghetti?
-We're out of spaghetti.

429
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:39,622
-Well, do we have macaroni?
-That's too short.

430
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:42,025
-We can tie it together with--
-No.

431
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:43,630
Hurry!

432
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:45,264
Hang on, Stuart!

433
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:49,397
-Margalo, what are you doing?
-Stuart, I'm coming! Grab on!

434
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,233
Lower! Lower!

435
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:53,070
I got it!

436
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:57,742
-Are you all right?
-Are you hurt?

437
00:32:59,982 --> 00:33:02,246
Don't scare me like that.

438
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:06,046
Margalo, you're the best friend I ever had.

439
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:17,859
What if someone had accidentally
turned on the garbage disposal?

440
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,692
I would not have let that happen.

441
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,363
-You let him go down the drain.
-He wanted to go.

442
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:24,201
If Martha wanted to go up the chimney...

443
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:27,367
...or George wanted to go into the toilet,
would you let them?

444
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:30,105
I love Stuart as much as you do.

445
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:32,744
I just don't happen to be quite as....

446
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:36,716
Emotional? Irrational?
What were you going to say?

447
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:38,915
I forget.

448
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:41,612
I know I'm overprotective, it's just...

449
00:33:41,891 --> 00:33:44,758
...I can't stand the idea of Stuart getting hurt.

450
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,534
I'm sorry, Stuart.

451
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,342
What?

452
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:26,220
You people sure like your meat loaf.

453
00:35:26,896 --> 00:35:28,295
You find the ring?

454
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:31,129
Everything but.

455
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,603
Has anyone seen Margalo?
I can't find her anywhere.

456
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,176
Maybe she just went for a walk
or a little flight around the neighborhood.

457
00:35:42,244 --> 00:35:44,007
Sure, to strengthen her wing.

458
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,140
Yeah, maybe. But why'd she leave me her pin?

459
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:52,410
Oh, you know, Stuart...

460
00:35:52,588 --> 00:35:55,489
...Margalo is kind of a free spirit.

461
00:35:55,758 --> 00:35:58,090
Maybe she just felt it was time to go.

462
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,487
Without even saying goodbye?

463
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:25,750
What are you doing?

464
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:29,052
I think I know what happened.
I think that falcon got her.

465
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:32,126
-Yeah?
-I'm going to find her.

466
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:35,722
And don't try to talk me out of it.
I've made up my mind.

467
00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:38,631
Are you crazy? You can't go out there.

468
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:42,965
Because I'm too small? Let me tell you
something, you're as big as you feel.

469
00:36:43,472 --> 00:36:45,633
Then let me come with you.

470
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:48,402
No, I need you to stay and cover for me.

471
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,478
Cover for you? How?

472
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:52,739
Make something up. You're smart.

473
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:54,442
Stuart, she's just a bird.

474
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:57,349
No, George, she's my friend.

475
00:36:57,653 --> 00:37:01,350
And when you're friends with Stuart Little,
you're friends for life.

476
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:06,420
Well, ifyou won't let me come,
at least get somebody to go with you.

477
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:12,166
Snow!

478
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:15,362
The good silverware's in the dining room.
Take anything, but don't hurt me.

479
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:17,098
It's me. Stuart.

480
00:37:18,274 --> 00:37:20,606
You. This better be important.

481
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:22,367
Margalo's still missing.

482
00:37:22,444 --> 00:37:25,936
I should've been more specific.
I meant important to me.

483
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:28,777
I'm going to look for her. I hoped you'd come.

484
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:33,149
Look, Stuart, do yourself a favor.
Buy a parakeet and forget her.

485
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:37,155
I can't forget her.
She's in terrible trouble and I have to help her.

486
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,793
I mean what am l, a man or a...

487
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:40,984
...mouse?

488
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:44,694
Is that a trick question?

489
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:48,292
It's important. You got to help me.

490
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,131
And why would I do that?

491
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:51,898
Well, because we're family...

492
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:54,966
...and because I'd do the same for you.

493
00:37:55,144 --> 00:38:00,138
And if you don't, and the Littles ask where I am,
George'll say you ate me.

494
00:38:00,316 --> 00:38:01,681
What?

495
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,748
Why you little rat!

496
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:07,085
You know something?

497
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:11,919
Everybody thinks you're so nice.
You're not so nice.

498
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:16,155
Come on! It'll be fun. It's an adventure.

499
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:23,935
Hey! Mario Andretti, slow down.
Let's pace ourselves.

500
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,733
I'll have a heart attack.

501
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:30,438
I think I'm having a thrombosis
and I don't even know what it means.

502
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,717
George! Stuart! Breakfast!

503
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:40,179
Get it while it's hot.

504
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:42,154
Say, "Mama."

505
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:45,422
Say, "Dada."

506
00:38:45,594 --> 00:38:47,824
Say anything?

507
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:50,754
'Morning, George.

508
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:52,194
Where's Stuart?

509
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:53,632
He already left.

510
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:56,429
He did? Without eating breakfast?

511
00:38:57,673 --> 00:39:00,005
He had to get to school early...

512
00:39:00,209 --> 00:39:02,302
...because he's in a school play.

513
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:04,040
Really?

514
00:39:04,113 --> 00:39:08,209
Yes. He plays a mouse.
And they rehearse every morning before school.

515
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:11,978
Why didn't he tell us?

516
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:15,420
He forgot.
You know, being worried about Margalo.

517
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,289
Right.

518
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:21,122
Good. This'll keep his mind off it.

519
00:39:22,398 --> 00:39:23,626
Got to go.

520
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,308
Say, "Oatmeal."

521
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:41,112
Oh, boy. This is a sign, Stuart.
Like the burning bush.

522
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:44,080
Except it's a carburetor and I'm not Moses.

523
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:46,184
But it's telling us something.

524
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:48,189
Let your people go!

525
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:50,756
-We're not giving up.
-Oh, why not?

526
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:54,019
Giving up is fun.
And look at all the time you save.

527
00:39:54,163 --> 00:39:58,657
I'm telling you, if more people gave up,
there'd be fewer wars.

528
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,057
Bill.

529
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:32,832
George.

530
00:40:33,135 --> 00:40:34,227
Hi, Mom.

531
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:37,130
Where's Stuart?

532
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:38,468
He's not home?

533
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:43,242
Oh, I just remembered.
He told me to tell you that he's rehearsing again.

534
00:40:43,312 --> 00:40:46,338
At Will's house.
And he's sleeping over there tonight.

535
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:48,483
Sleepover? On a school night?

536
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,212
Hey, that's what he said. Got to go.

537
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,556
Hello?

538
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:08,331
Hey, Will. It's me, George.
If my mom calls, Stuart's at your house, okay?

539
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:10,162
Hold on a second.

540
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,429
Hello?

541
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:16,008
Will, hi. It's Mrs. Little.
May I speak with Stuart, please?

542
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,341
-Stuart?
-You know, my son.

543
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:21,310
Oh, Stuart. You mean now?

544
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:23,417
Well, now is when I'm calling.

545
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:25,851
Oh, he just went in the bathroom.

546
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:29,784
I think he'll be a while. He brought a magazine.

547
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,927
-Well, then, is your mother there?
-Hold on a second.

548
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:35,860
-I told her.
-Did she buy it?

549
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:39,229
Yeah, but now she wants to speak to my mom.
What will I tell her?

550
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:40,893
Make something up. You're smart.

551
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:43,767
If I was smart, I wouldn't be in this situation.

552
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:49,133
She can't come to the phone right now.
She's in the bathroom, too.

553
00:41:49,211 --> 00:41:51,543
But not the same bathroom!

554
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:55,715
-Just let her know I called. Thanks.
-Okay, Mrs. Little.

555
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:59,150
-It's all clear.
-I owe you one.

556
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:03,553
-Now will you tell me what's going on?
-It's too complicated. Later.

557
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,428
Little hi, Little low.

558
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:09,256
Little hey, Little ho.

559
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:13,430
-Boys home?
-Well, George is.

560
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:18,129
But Stuart is rehearsing his play.
Then he's sleeping over at Will's house.

561
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:23,004
-He's going without George?
-I think it'll give him room to grow.

562
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:33,283
Oh, Stuart, we've been walking for hours.
I can't take another step.

563
00:42:34,456 --> 00:42:38,654
You know me, I hate to be negative.
But when I walk this much, I chafe.

564
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:42,489
Also, I hate to bring this up...

565
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:44,927
...but I need to go tinky.

566
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:46,766
How about the alley?

567
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:49,702
I'm a house cat. We're fastidious creatures.

568
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:54,535
We don't just yell, "Bomb's away!"
and go wherever we are!

569
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:57,644
Oh, look, let's face it. We'll never find her.

570
00:42:57,879 --> 00:43:00,507
If only we knew someone
who really knew the city.

571
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:03,813
Yeah, someone who knows
the city's disgusting underbelly.

572
00:43:04,286 --> 00:43:06,311
Who do I know that's disgusting?

573
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,032
Don't threaten me!
What I could tell the health inspector...

574
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:22,593
...would close you down in a New York minute!

575
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:24,036
Monty!

576
00:43:24,973 --> 00:43:29,774
Snowbell! What are you doing here?

577
00:43:29,845 --> 00:43:32,973
-We've been looking all over for you.
-We need your help.

578
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:36,347
Hey, Snow, are you two still friends
or can I eat him?

579
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:39,645
-No, Monty, you can't eat him.
-Please.

580
00:43:39,721 --> 00:43:41,450
No! Now, pay attention.

581
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:44,151
What do you know about a bird called Falcon?

582
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:48,921
Falcon? Oh, that's a bad guy.
You don't want to fool with him.

583
00:43:49,097 --> 00:43:50,655
Where would we find him?

584
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:52,927
You don't want to find him.

585
00:43:53,101 --> 00:43:56,400
You don't want anything to do with him.
Trust me.

586
00:43:56,471 --> 00:44:00,430
He'd eat you so fast you'd be falcon poop
before you could yell for help.

587
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:02,437
Falcons are vicious.

588
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:06,447
They grab you by your neck and carry you
so high, you can't even see the ground.

589
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:11,851
Then they drop you. And when you land,
they drink what's left through a straw.

590
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:14,645
Snowbell, are you all right?

591
00:44:14,723 --> 00:44:17,920
Oh, yeah. In fact, good news:

592
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:20,584
I no longer need a litter box.

593
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:25,256
Mop up on aisle three.

594
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:30,463
Stu, listen.
This whole thing has been a groove and a gas...

595
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:33,201
...but it's important to know when the fun's over.

596
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:36,438
You don't want to be that last pathetic person
who leaves a party.

597
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:40,447
I told you. I'm not giving up.
We're going to find the falcon.

598
00:44:40,782 --> 00:44:43,342
All right, then. It's your funeral.

599
00:44:43,552 --> 00:44:46,020
Okay, listen. Listen carefully.

600
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:48,951
The falcon lives across the park...

601
00:44:49,257 --> 00:44:52,454
...at the very tiptop of the Pishkin Building.

602
00:44:52,627 --> 00:44:56,393
Not many people go up there.
And even fewer return.

603
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:22,387
Well, here we are, Snowbell. This is it.

604
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,558
"Salmon, catfish, tuna."

605
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:33,291
Why do they taunt me?

606
00:45:33,435 --> 00:45:37,735
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Stay on track, will you?

607
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:40,237
I'm nervous. When I'm nervous, I eat.

608
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:45,335
Because I know in my growling gut
if anything happens to you, I'll be blamed.

609
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:49,677
I'm sure they already know we're gone
and plan to replace me with a hamster.

610
00:45:49,918 --> 00:45:51,886
Don't worry. George has us covered.

611
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:55,855
George?
George doesn't know poop from applesauce.

612
00:45:56,057 --> 00:45:58,252
And I say that with a great deal of affection.

613
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:08,193
-Hello, Little residence.
-Oh, George. I'm glad you answered.

614
00:46:08,403 --> 00:46:10,166
Who is it? Can you speak louder?

615
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:12,638
George, it's me, Stuart.

616
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:19,771
Where are you? How are you? Did you
find her? Are you all right? How's Snowbell?

617
00:46:19,848 --> 00:46:22,715
When'll you be home?
Mom and Dad are asking lots of questions.

618
00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:23,682
So are you.

619
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:27,415
I only have a second.
I just want you to know that we're on the trail...

620
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:30,890
...and with any luck, we'll be home by dinner.
And, George...

621
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:33,559
-...thanks for covering for me.
-Sure.

622
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:35,127
But where are you?

623
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,461
Now, listen closely.
We're at the Pishkin Building.

624
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:41,502
Please deposit $0.35 for the next five minutes.

625
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:45,768
-Snowbell, I need more change.
-What do I look like, a fanny pack?

626
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:47,565
Are you still there?

627
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:49,937
Is that Stuart?

628
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:52,110
Let me think. Yeah.

629
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:55,072
I thought he was coming home.

630
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:58,343
He is. Later.
He and Will just need to rehearse some more.

631
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,412
In fact, I just left him at Will's.

632
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:09,023
Hello, Mrs. Little. Is George home?

633
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,797
-Will, I found it!
-Found what?

634
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:16,394
-The calculator.
-The calculator?

635
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:18,731
Will, where's Stuart?

636
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,972
It's okay. She knows about the play.

637
00:47:22,244 --> 00:47:24,371
It's supposed to be a surprise.

638
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:28,978
I had to tell her so she'd know
Stuart's at your house. We're going back there.

639
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,814
Oh, yeah. Right. It's going to be great.

640
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:34,014
I just need to get the calculator?

641
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:37,650
-To figure out how long to rehearse.
-It's a very complicated play.

642
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:40,991
-Come on. Let's go.
-See you later, Mrs. Little.

643
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:44,325
George, don't forget
you two have a soccer game later.

644
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:45,889
We'll meet you there!

645
00:47:50,238 --> 00:47:54,607
I can't handle this. I'm too stressed.
All this lying. I've never lied before.

646
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,741
That's why she believes you.

647
00:47:56,912 --> 00:47:58,846
-Boy, are we in trouble.
-"We"?

648
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:02,611
Yeah, "we." He didn't spend the night
rehearsing at my house.

649
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:16,460
What are you planning to do,
Mighty Mouse, scale the wall?

650
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:18,563
I'll think of something.

651
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:33,980
So long, Snowbell!

652
00:48:34,149 --> 00:48:35,673
You've got guts, kid.

653
00:48:36,151 --> 00:48:38,745
Guts and spunk.

654
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:41,148
Not to mention moxie.

655
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:43,682
You've got guts, spunk and moxie.

656
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:04,742
Okay. Here we go.

657
00:49:05,313 --> 00:49:09,443
All right, Falcon.
Hand her over and nobody gets hurt.

658
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:32,537
You up here?

659
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:39,745
Is anybody here?

660
00:49:39,948 --> 00:49:41,916
I'm here.

661
00:49:45,186 --> 00:49:49,145
I came for my friend Margalo.
lfyou've hurt her, I'll--

662
00:49:49,324 --> 00:49:52,487
-You'll what?
-Tell me right now. Is she all right?

663
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:55,528
Why not ask her yourself, Whiskers?

664
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:00,524
Margalo, run!

665
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:04,596
Fly away while I've got him covered.
What are you waiting for?

666
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:11,311
This kid's priceless.
Tell me, Cheese-face, does this sound familiar?

667
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,548
"Oh, my wing. I don't think I can fly."

668
00:50:15,116 --> 00:50:16,879
What are you talking about?

669
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:21,445
I can't drill through the wood.
She scammed you. She played you like a harp.

670
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:24,452
Margalo, what does he mean?

671
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:29,356
Okay, now it's getting sad.
Maybe this will clear things up.

672
00:50:30,198 --> 00:50:32,189
My mom's ring.

673
00:50:35,003 --> 00:50:39,133
I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.

674
00:50:39,841 --> 00:50:42,708
But, Margalo, why?

675
00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:45,040
Don't be upset, Mouse-boy.

676
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,512
She has conned smarter than you.
Or did you think you were special?

677
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:51,346
A real friend?

678
00:50:51,553 --> 00:50:54,044
I didn't lie about that, Stuart.

679
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:56,353
You are my friend.

680
00:50:57,258 --> 00:50:58,953
Then come with me.

681
00:50:59,761 --> 00:51:01,490
She's not going anywhere.

682
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:03,361
Oh, yes, she is.

683
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:10,235
Was that your best shot?
Now, let me show you mine.

684
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:13,367
Don't hurt him, Falcon!

685
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:16,806
I won't hurt him. The sidewalk will!

686
00:51:17,011 --> 00:51:19,377
Can't we talk this over?

687
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:23,113
No! Stuart!

688
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:27,886
Let me go! No, Falcon!

689
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:45,302
A few days in here should provide you
with an attitude adjustment.

690
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:52,913
What have I done?

691
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:59,482
I'll bet something terrible has happened.
The Littles will kill me.

692
00:51:59,554 --> 00:52:03,581
I know, I'll bring home another mouse
in a snazzy outfit...

693
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:07,492
...teach him to drive a sports car
and pass him off as Stuart.

694
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:11,564
Who am I kidding?
I have to get up there. But how?

695
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:21,765
I hope I live to regret this.

696
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:29,344
Stuart? Yoo-hoo?

697
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:37,688
Come out, come out wherever you are.

698
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,724
Please don't jump out from behind anything.

699
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:46,123
Remember, I have a strong stomach
but a very weak heart.

700
00:52:48,303 --> 00:52:49,793
Here, Mousie-Mousie.

701
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:53,198
Snowbell? Is that you? Is that really you?

702
00:52:53,441 --> 00:52:56,604
-Margalo? Where are you?
-ln the can.

703
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:58,278
Oh, okay. I'll wait.

704
00:52:58,346 --> 00:53:00,780
No, in the paint can.

705
00:53:03,718 --> 00:53:06,710
Why are you in there?
Is this some kind of trick?

706
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:08,411
Just get me out.

707
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,585
Is Stuart in there, too?

708
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:13,591
No, Snowbell, he's dead.

709
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:16,152
What? Stuart is dead?

710
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:17,921
Falcon killed him.

711
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:21,000
No. He can't be, he's....

712
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:24,596
I was supposed to protect him.

713
00:53:25,773 --> 00:53:28,606
I wish it was me who had been killed.

714
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:30,633
Really?

715
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:35,473
No. But I am very unhappy!

716
00:53:57,705 --> 00:54:01,937
Oh, dear. I'm dumped on a boat.

717
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:06,037
I'm on a garbage barge. I got to get off.

718
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:09,817
Hello there!

719
00:54:09,884 --> 00:54:14,844
I'm over here! On the barge! Can you hear me?

720
00:54:15,023 --> 00:54:16,354
Help!

721
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:19,116
I'm not supposed to be here!

722
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:21,628
I need to get off!

723
00:54:21,996 --> 00:54:23,964
Help me!

724
00:54:24,866 --> 00:54:26,265
Help!

725
00:54:36,678 --> 00:54:40,239
Rita, hi. I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd get the boys.

726
00:54:40,415 --> 00:54:42,610
-George and Will?
-George and Stuart.

727
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,218
George is here, but I haven't seen Stuart.

728
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,451
But he slept here last night.

729
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:49,512
No.

730
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:51,824
George!

731
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:56,324
What are you going to do now?

732
00:54:56,397 --> 00:54:57,864
Which way's Canada?

733
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,406
This is terrible.

734
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,241
I just want to go home.

735
00:55:13,014 --> 00:55:16,347
I know a Little is supposed
to always see a silver lining.

736
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:20,744
Maybe this means I'm not really a Little.

737
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:25,019
Maybe I'm just Stuart Nobody.

738
00:55:25,593 --> 00:55:27,424
Stuart Nothing.

739
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:45,775
There is no silver lining!

740
00:55:51,753 --> 00:55:54,085
Oh, no. What have I done?

741
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:13,897
My plane.

742
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:15,834
My plane!

743
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:19,240
The silver lining! This is it!

744
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,712
-All right, George, where is he?
-And this time, the truth.

745
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:31,552
I'm not sure.

746
00:56:31,826 --> 00:56:34,192
It is never okay to lie to your parents.

747
00:56:34,262 --> 00:56:36,526
Is it okay to break a promise to your brother?

748
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:39,498
It's wrong to promise your brother
you'll lie to your parents.

749
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:43,594
Listen to the tone of my voice.
Tell us where Stuart is.

750
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:45,696
It was a promise. Brother to brother.

751
00:56:45,773 --> 00:56:48,435
George, I understand. I have a brother.

752
00:56:48,743 --> 00:56:52,679
But if he was in danger,
that would matter more to me than the promise.

753
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:57,150
How would we all feel
if anything happened to Stuart?

754
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:01,187
He's at the Pishkin Building.

755
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,682
-Dad.
-What?

756
00:57:03,858 --> 00:57:07,191
-Am I in trouble?
-No, son. You're in big trouble.

757
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:48,786
-Mom, Dad, I'm really sorry.
-You should be.

758
00:58:48,896 --> 00:58:53,424
For all we know, Stuart could be out there now,
lying face down with his--

759
00:58:54,202 --> 00:58:57,694
Or, he could be fine.
We don't have to assume the worst.

760
00:58:58,072 --> 00:59:00,233
After all, it's not the Little way.

761
00:59:00,408 --> 00:59:05,175
Yes, you're right. He could be puttering home
right now in his shiny little car.

762
00:59:05,513 --> 00:59:06,878
Smiling and happy.

763
00:59:06,948 --> 00:59:09,246
His whiskers fluttering in the breeze.

764
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:10,850
-Mom.
-Yes, George.

765
00:59:11,052 --> 00:59:13,179
I don't think he's puttering home.

766
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:17,856
Who would do this?

767
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,559
Tiny little vandals.

768
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:27,727
That miserable falcon!

769
00:59:28,236 --> 00:59:31,603
From this day forward, I vow revenge.

770
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:35,331
If that falcon were here right now,
I'd rip his throat out.

771
00:59:35,543 --> 00:59:37,909
I'd scratch his face off. I'd--

772
00:59:40,248 --> 00:59:41,340
That's him.

773
00:59:41,549 --> 00:59:42,811
Don't hurt me.

774
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:44,578
Kill the bird, not me.

775
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:47,253
I'm going to be falcon poop.

776
00:59:48,256 --> 00:59:51,521
Well, well, well. The canary is out of her cage.

777
00:59:51,726 --> 00:59:54,923
And how nice.
She's brought a friend for dinner.

778
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:58,190
Too bad I don't like canned food.

779
01:00:02,403 --> 01:00:03,836
Snowbell, get out!

780
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:07,271
Can't. Stuck. Too fat!

781
01:00:19,287 --> 01:00:21,949
Don't do it, Falcon. Or else!

782
01:00:22,123 --> 01:00:23,715
Do what? What's he doing?

783
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:25,019
Or else what?

784
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:28,789
Or else you'll lose this.

785
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,389
Put that down, Margalo.

786
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,626
I'm through doing what you tell me to do.
I'm leaving you, Falcon, forever.

787
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:39,133
Oh, and what do you think you'll be without me?

788
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,171
Free.

789
01:00:44,312 --> 01:00:49,249
Big mistake. I'll be back for you, Fur-ball.

790
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,510
Don't hurry!

791
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:10,265
-Stuart! You're alive!
-So far!

792
01:01:10,471 --> 01:01:12,063
Where'd you get the plane?

793
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:13,572
A garbage dump.

794
01:01:13,808 --> 01:01:15,105
Sorry I asked.

795
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:18,676
-I hope we're not too late.
-Keep your eyes peeled. He could be anywhere.

796
01:01:18,746 --> 01:01:20,907
Careful now. One step at a time.

797
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:24,413
That's it. You're going to make it. Yeah!

798
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:35,125
I'm alive. I'm alive.

799
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:40,791
Stuart! Is that you? Take me with you!

800
01:01:41,502 --> 01:01:45,233
What about me? How will I get down from here?

801
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,743
I think this is it. Turn here.

802
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:51,937
Okey-dokey. No problem.

803
01:01:58,085 --> 01:01:59,575
Hey, look! It's Stuart.

804
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:01,314
Stop the car!

805
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:08,925
Stuart!

806
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:12,664
Look at that bird. He's bigger than me.

807
01:02:12,867 --> 01:02:14,732
We got to save him. Come on.

808
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:17,563
It's the Littles. I'm saved!

809
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:19,669
Wait! It's me!

810
01:02:19,807 --> 01:02:21,399
Follow that flying mouse.

811
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:23,170
-No problem.
-Hey-Little, Ho-Little...

812
01:02:23,244 --> 01:02:26,304
...Hoo-Little, Hey-Hottle, Ho-Wottle, Wo-Wittle.

813
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:45,625
There he is!

814
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:54,666
If we get out of this,
I'm sticking to painting and dancing.

815
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:59,272
Hey, lady! Get out of the way!

816
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,073
He's closing in.

817
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:20,998
Oh, my goodness.

818
01:03:27,775 --> 01:03:28,969
Keep it running.

819
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:30,772
Okey-dokey. No problem.

820
01:03:42,189 --> 01:03:43,588
He can't hear you.

821
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,895
I think we lost him.

822
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:51,795
Going up?

823
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:56,733
Frederick, I feel so helpless.

824
01:04:00,641 --> 01:04:02,939
A mouse needs to know his limitations.

825
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:09,681
Stuart! Pull up!

826
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,951
I can't! It's stuck!

827
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:13,950
Well, try harder!

828
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:17,521
Margalo! Get out! Save yourself!

829
01:04:17,992 --> 01:04:21,291
No, Stuart! If we go, we go together!

830
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:26,527
Stuart! Pull up!

831
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,428
-Pull up, Stuart!
-Stuart, pull up!

832
01:04:41,348 --> 01:04:46,081
You should've stayed
in your little hole, Mouse-boy.

833
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:50,183
Stuart, we can't outrun him.

834
01:04:50,257 --> 01:04:52,248
Then we'll just have to face him.

835
01:04:52,326 --> 01:04:55,193
It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.

836
01:04:55,462 --> 01:04:58,488
But I have to try. I'll be back for you later.

837
01:04:59,133 --> 01:05:00,464
What do you mean?

838
01:05:03,504 --> 01:05:05,734
Stuart! Don't do it!

839
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:13,804
Party's over, Fur-face.

840
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:23,180
What's he doing?

841
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:24,519
They'll crash!

842
01:05:24,658 --> 01:05:26,387
Stuart! Turn! Run away!

843
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:44,009
Bye-bye, Birdbrain!

844
01:05:51,986 --> 01:05:53,715
Oh, dear.

845
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:57,022
Got you.

846
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:07,127
Can't I get a decent meal in this city?

847
01:06:14,108 --> 01:06:15,302
Thank you.

848
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:20,871
Stuart! Are you okay?

849
01:06:20,948 --> 01:06:22,813
I am now. Margalo saved me.

850
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:24,644
We saved each other.

851
01:06:24,952 --> 01:06:27,079
What did you think you were doing?

852
01:06:27,254 --> 01:06:30,712
-You almost gave me a heart attack.
-I'm sorry, Mom.

853
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:32,720
-You ran away from home.
-I know.

854
01:06:32,793 --> 01:06:34,590
And you had George lie to us.

855
01:06:34,662 --> 01:06:35,686
Yeah.

856
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:39,259
Then why am I so proud of you?

857
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:42,267
Mrs. Little, this belongs to you.

858
01:06:44,038 --> 01:06:45,232
My ring.

859
01:06:45,572 --> 01:06:47,403
Yeah, I took it.

860
01:06:47,574 --> 01:06:49,474
And now she's giving it back.

861
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,947
I'm just happy to have all ofyou back.

862
01:07:00,721 --> 01:07:02,245
Snowbell!

863
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:03,482
You made it.

864
01:07:03,891 --> 01:07:04,915
Thank goodness you're all right.

865
01:07:05,225 --> 01:07:10,162
Snowbell, where have you been?

866
01:07:10,264 --> 01:07:12,255
You wouldn't believe
what Stuart and Margalo have been through.

867
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:17,497
You should have seen it.
These two were so brave.

868
01:07:19,573 --> 01:07:21,006
Let's go home.

869
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:27,207
And how about me? I played no part in this?

870
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:31,678
Well, I have had enough!
I'm staying right here, folks!

871
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:35,048
Oh, yeah. You'll never see me again!

872
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:37,720
Snow, want some tuna when we get home?

873
01:07:37,825 --> 01:07:41,283
Tuna? I love these people.

874
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:44,727
Wait! Wait for me!

875
01:07:49,603 --> 01:07:53,095
I guess they're flying south for the winter?

876
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,805
I guess.

877
01:07:58,212 --> 01:08:02,649
You've always dreamed of going, haven't you?
But Falcon never let you.

878
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,077
Every year I'd just watch all the other birds go.

879
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:09,380
The ones who were free.

880
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:11,788
You're free.

881
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:15,884
We'd be so far apart.

882
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:19,322
It wouldn't change a thing.

883
01:08:43,924 --> 01:08:44,913
Well....

884
01:08:45,392 --> 01:08:49,522
-You're sure of the way? We can call AAA.
-We can get you maps, discount coupons.

885
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:53,430
There's a place in South Carolina
where they do the best pecan pie.

886
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,194
I'm a bird. Instinct should take over.

887
01:08:56,603 --> 01:08:58,696
I guess you've waited for this a long time.

888
01:08:58,772 --> 01:09:01,707
All my life. Only....

889
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,702
Only what, dear?

890
01:09:04,778 --> 01:09:08,270
Well, now it's not just talk.
Now, it's the real thing.

891
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:09,745
Are you scared?

892
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:13,383
The world's pretty big, and I'm pretty small.

893
01:09:13,787 --> 01:09:17,484
Somebody once told me,
"You're as big as you feel."

894
01:09:18,058 --> 01:09:19,992
Just spread your wings...

895
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,223
...and soar.

896
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:25,257
I'll miss you, Stuart.

897
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:33,071
I'll miss you, too.

898
01:09:38,278 --> 01:09:40,246
I'll miss all ofyou.

899
01:09:41,315 --> 01:09:42,976
You, too, Snowbell.

900
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,576
I'm not going to cry.

901
01:09:54,995 --> 01:09:56,986
Little hi, Little low.

902
01:09:57,197 --> 01:09:59,529
Little hey, Little ho.

903
01:10:04,004 --> 01:10:05,164
Stuart?

904
01:10:05,339 --> 01:10:06,431
Yeah, Dad?

905
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:08,768
What's the silver lining this time?

906
01:10:09,843 --> 01:10:11,936
She'll be back in the spring.

907
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,941
Bye-bye, birdie.

908
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:23,620
-Did you hear that?
-Her first words! She spoke!

909
01:10:23,824 --> 01:10:26,349
-Of course she did.
-I knew she could do it.

910
01:10:26,493 --> 01:10:31,123
Big deal. When she can fall from a tree
and land on her feet, then I'll be impressed.
