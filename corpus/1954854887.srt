I'm still thinking about it.

176
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:43,282
I thought you never
wanted to get married.

177
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:43,849
I know.

178
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:46,351
You said it was the surest
way to ruin a relationship.

179
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:49,754
Well, not getting married
doesn't seem to work either.

180
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:52,022
Are you kidding me?

181
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,290
Look, I know this is sudden

182
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,426
but if I'm going to do this,
I'd really like your support.

183
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:58,660
I thought you were still
thinking about it.

184
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:01,029
I am. I am still thinking
about it.

185
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:05,266
You're thinking right now
about it, as we speak?

186
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,533
I'm pregnant.

187
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:11,703
Oh. Oh, wow.

188
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,038
Is it his?

189
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,073
- Of course it's his!
- Just asking.

190
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:22,812
Look, I just want to know there's going to
be someone there when I'm old and gross.

191
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:25,747
I was going to be there.

192
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:27,848
Don't.

193
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:34,286
- I think I should go.
- Why?

194
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:35,620
I don't know.

195
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:38,389
Just feels like what
I should do right now.

196
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,357
- Will?
- Yeah?

197
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,892
Take the cookie.

198
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,295
Okay, great.

199
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:05,945
"Why does life suck..."
Double underline... "So hard?"

200
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:07,112
Any thoughts?

201
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,848
Because people are selfish
and petty.

202
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,317
I love that passion, but no.

203
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:12,884
It doesn't?

204
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:17,421
No, life sucks because my ex left
me for an Off-Broadway monologist

205
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,524
who just knocked her up
and asked her to marry him.

206
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,361
Now Gary is going to see my
daughters more than I do.

207
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,496
He's going
to live in my old house,

208
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,964
he's going to take over
my family

209
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:32,735
while I eke out a lonely existence
in a studio apartment in Astoria.

210
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:35,870
Have you been to Astoria?

211
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:39,073
I think like once,
for a party or something.

212
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,608
- Yeah, once.
- What's a monologist?

213
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,743
It's like a comedian without
the jokes.

214
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:44,910
- That's a thing?
- Yeah, that's a thing.

215
00:14:44,912 --> 00:14:48,079
According to the MacArthur
Foundation, it's a thing.

216
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:51,415
He's probably monologuing
to my daughters right now.

217
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:51,982
JASON: I don't get it.

218
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:54,918
Does any of this have to do
with the graphic novel?

219
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:57,619
Why are we here?

220
00:14:57,787 --> 00:14:58,852
To learn?

221
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:02,922
You're on fire today, Paul.
To learn. To learn what?

222
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:03,489
How to tell a story.

223
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:06,492
Why does anyone need to tell
a story in the first place?

224
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,327
Because...

225
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,163
You did it again. Anyone else?

226
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:12,597
To understand ourselves better.

227
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,098
Okay, that sounds
nice, but, uh...

228
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,801
If that's the only reason, then
why not just go to therapy?

229
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:20,436
Because therapy is stupid?

230
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:21,670
WILL: Yeah...

231
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,339
Maybe it's stupid.

232
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,209
Yeah, can I go home?

233
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:32,146
Just... Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.

234
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,982
Great comments, guys,
thank you.

235
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,758
- Uh, Mr. Henry?
- Yeah?

236
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,825
Are you okay?

237
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:51,829
- Yeah, I'm fine. -I'm
just having a bad life.

238
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:54,464
It'll be over eventually.

239
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,132
Um...

240
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:57,500
I don't want this to seem
weird or anything,

241
00:15:57,502 --> 00:16:00,936
but would you maybe like to
come to my place for dinner?

242
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,905
Uh...

243
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:10,343
Listen... Thank you so much...

244
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,814
- Kat.
- Kat? Yeah, Kat.

245
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,883
Uh, that's a really
kind offer, Kat.

246
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:18,550
Ah, but...

247
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:20,952
(WHISPERING) We're not
supposed to date students.

248
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,887
No, oh, my God, no!

249
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,422
Oh, this? Yeah, no never!

250
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:27,457
Did you think I was
asking you out?

251
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:29,958
- No!
- Oh, my God!

252
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
(STUTTERS) No, no,
definitely not.

253
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:35,663
No, no, I would never do that.
That is so gross!

254
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:39,900
Wow, I... Sir, I would never, I
would never, ever, ever do that.

255
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:41,201
Okay, I'm not the Elephant Man.

256
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:43,903
No, no, I know, you're just,
you're so old.

257
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,804
Why the hell did you ask me
over for dinner for?

258
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,273
Because I want you
to meet my mom.

259
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,607
Oh, your mom?

260
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,875
- Yeah, a cute mom.
- How old is your mom?

261
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,843
- Forty-five.
- How old do you think I am?

262
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:58,747
Oh, I don't know, I...
Like, between 50 and 62?

263
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:01,449
I'm only 39...
Uh, no, I turned 40.

264
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:04,785
- I'm a young 40.
- Well, here she is.

265
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:07,486
Oh, that... That's your mom?

266
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,321
Yeah, and she likes
your work too.

267
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:11,889
Well, that's sweet.

268
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,891
Mmm-hmm, she's sweet.

269
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,261
Listen, Kat, I'm...
I'm still getting over my ex.

270
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:19,629
Look, you should
just meet my mom.

271
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,998
I promise you won't meet
anybody nearly as hot as her

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,799
in your apartment, okay?

273
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:26,768
God, I hate that apartment.

274
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,903
You know what, Kat?

275
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:31,771
What the hell,
I'll meet your cute mom.

276
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:35,674
Great. Here's the address,
be there at 8:00.

277
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:39,544
And wear something nice.

278
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:41,512
Like this kind of thing?

This is just so awkward.

286
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,453
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
it would be awkward.

it's nice to meet you too.

Look, I don't mean
to be rude, but,

291
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:46,033
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm seeing someone.

293

Yeah, you know,
Kat doesn't know.

294
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,636
Which is why she set this up.

295
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:51,637
Truth is, I don't think
she'd like the guy.

296
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:54,406
I'm not even sure if I like him
but, we've had a couple dates

297
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:58,009
and I just, I don't know, I just feel as
though I should be straightforward with you.

298
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,177
I know a lot of people date a
lot of people nowadays and...

299
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,246
I don't know, I'm not comfortable
with that sort of thing. Yeah.

300
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:05,047
No judgment of course
if, if that's what you do.

301
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:08,750
I mean you could be coming from a
date right now for all I know, right?

302
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,352
You're not coming from
a date right now though?

303
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:11,785
Huh?

304
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:14,354
Uh-uh, no, no, don't
answer it, don't answer it

305

and as a matter of fact,
just forget it.

That is none
of my business. Hmm.

307

And I'm sorry.

Mmm. Dating sucks.

00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,299
It does.

00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,668
Um, well, okay...

311
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,138
I guess I'll... I guess
I'll just go home then.

312
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,506
Oh, no...

313
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,741
- You can't go.
- Why not?

to know your teacher.

- Yeah.

Very tight...
Very tight friends.

326
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:18,839
So, how long have you been
making comic books?

327
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:22,676
I'm not sure, um, ever since
I was a kid, I suppose.

328
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:24,010
Hmm, really?

329
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:25,478
Were your parents encouraging?

330
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,314
- Oh, not at all.
- Why not?

331
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:31,450
Not a lot of successful comic
book artists where I'm from.

332
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:35,187
- Oh. Where are you from?
- New Zealand.

333
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:37,522
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

334
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:40,057
Oh, you've been to New Zealand?

335
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,190
No, but...

336
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:44,393
Kat makes me go see
all the <i> Hobbit</i> movies, so...

Oh, so, you know
all about us and our ways.

- That was sassy. -Yeah, I'm
a sassy little hobbit.

Now tell me, truthfully...

341
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,271
Are there any successful
comic book writers anywhere?

342
00:20:58,273 --> 00:21:01,507
Well, the School of Visual
Arts has had its share. Yeah.

343
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:05,443

- American literature?

00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:12,578
I need someone
to look after my girls.

685
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,313
You want me
to babysit your kids?

686
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:17,082
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone
else to call on such short notice.

687
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:20,018
Charlie got all our friends
when we split.

688
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,554
Please. I'm desperate,
I've got a class in an hour.

689
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:25,722
Yeah, I know,
I'm in that class!

690
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,491
Well, I'll, uh, excuse
your absence.

691
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:32,161
Really? That's unbelievable.

692
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,429
Uh, I can pay you.

693
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:38,098
- Do they watch TV?
- They love TV!

694
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,433
Right, girls,
you like TV, right?

695
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:43,736
- Come on!
- Yeah, okay, fine...

696
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:45,904
- Whatever.
- Thank you so much.

697
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:46,738
Sure, what is this?

698
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,239
These are just
a couple of cellos.

699
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:50,941
- Couple of cellos? -Are they
supposed to play this right now?

700
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:52,909
No, you know, of course not.

701
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:55,211
Okay, girls, this is Kat.

702
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:58,581
- What's up?
- That means "hello."

703
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,350
C'mon, ya'll carryin'
your own cellos.

704
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,788
All right.

705
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:12,259
Memory pieces. Who wants
to share theirs first?

706
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,463
- Tom.
- Yeah.

707
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:25,470
Hi.

708
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:29,440
I decided to write about
how I learned to masturbate.

709
00:41:29,508 --> 00:41:31,441
I was 12.

710
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:34,577
So, one day, I walked into my
dad's office,

711
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,745
where he kept
all the dirty magazines.

712
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,382
And, uh, I found
some lotion and...

713
00:41:48,724 --> 00:41:50,590
You have a lot of nerve,
do you know that?

714
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,526
Is this because I didn't call you, because
I thought you were dating someone.

715
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:56,095
- No! No! -I thought... I wasn't
sure if the chemistry...

716
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,730
What are you
even talking about? (SIGHS)

717
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:00,898
This has nothing to do with us!

718
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,598
What's this to do with then?

719
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,535
This is about the fact that you asked
my daughter to skip your class

720
00:42:05,537 --> 00:42:07,336
so that she could
baby-sit your kids.

721
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:09,571
I'm sorry, I was in a desperate
situation this morning.

722
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:12,941
But you didn't think to ask any
of your male students for help?

723
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:14,909
Are you kidding?
My male students are idiots.

724
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,577
Oh! So, the idiots get to
go to class

725
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,647
while the bright girl stays at
home and takes care of your kids?

726
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:22,949
What kind of message
does that send to Kat?

727
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:24,417
Or to your daughters,
for that matter?

728
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:28,988
- I'm sorry, I just didn't think...
- Yeah, guys never do.

729
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:30,656
Is she here?

730
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:33,625
She went out, after she
put your girls to bed.

731
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:37,862
- They're asleep? It's only seven o'clock.
- They were exhausted!

732
00:42:37,864 --> 00:42:40,297
What are you doing to them?

733
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:44,500
I just wanted
more time with them.

734
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,636
Come inside.

735
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:53,973
Look, it's, it's none of my
business but...

736
00:42:53,975 --> 00:42:59,078
It just seems to me like you and your ex
are a little loose about all of this.

737
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,945
I mean they're children.

738
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:03,648
You can't just pass them
back and forth like puppies.

739
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,683
Yeah, I know.

740
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:09,720
- Why not? Why not?
- They need structure.

741
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:12,923
- Stability. -They get
that most of the time.

742
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:17,060
Look, it's pretty simple. In this kind
of situation, a child just wants to know

743
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:18,928
where they're gonna
sleep at night.

744
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,163
You shouldn't change that
on a whim.

745
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:24,666
- Yeah. Our kids are so screwed.
- No.

746
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,768
Believe me, I've made just about
every mistake there is to make

747
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:32,907
and if it's any consolation... Kat
made it through intact, more or less.

748
00:43:33,175 --> 00:43:34,707
Oh, Kat's a great kid.

749
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:39,244
Yeah, she is.
She really admires you.

750
00:43:39,346 --> 00:43:40,978
She does? Why?

751
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,679
She thinks you're
a great teacher.

752
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:46,916
- Not counting today, maybe.
- (CHUCKLES) No, minus today.

753
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:48,850
Wow, that's...

754
00:43:48,852 --> 00:43:50,885
That's really nice to hear.

755
00:43:50,887 --> 00:43:56,023
I think she was a little disappointed
when we didn't hit it off.

756
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:00,893
Yeah.

757
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,195
Uh, well, uh, we should
get going.

758
00:44:04,197 --> 00:44:08,432
What? You're not leaving!
Your girls are still sleeping.

759
00:44:08,434 --> 00:44:09,566
Yeah, we can't stay here.

760
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:11,501
- Sure, you can.
- I don't know.

761
00:44:11,503 --> 00:44:15,171
I do. And I'm not letting you
drag them back to Astoria

762
00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:16,739
in the middle of the night!

763
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:18,140
What is that, a $40 cab ride?

764
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:20,675
- I was going to take the subway.
- (SIGHS)

765
00:44:20,677 --> 00:44:25,646
Come on. I'm going to get you
some blankets for the couch.

766
00:44:28,884 --> 00:44:33,253
I can probably find you
some pajamas in here too.

767
00:44:33,521 --> 00:44:38,657
Oh, no, that's okay. I can
just sleep in, uh, my clothes.

768
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:41,425
(GRUNTS)

769
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:51,234
I see you've been doing
some reading?

770
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:54,703
Oh, yeah, I...

771
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:57,138
Felt bad after our...
Whatever it was.

772
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,741
And I thought I should at least
see what you were talking about.

773
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:05,011
- So, what did you think?
- I think that you were right.

774
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:08,614
Comic books are an under-appreciated
part of American literature.

775
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:11,083
- Really?
- Yeah, I had no idea

776
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:12,050
what people were doing
in the form.

777
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:16,554
I mean there's some really complex,
emotionally-wrenching stuff

778
00:45:16,556 --> 00:45:17,688
- going on there.
- What?

779
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:22,893
That's, that's amazing! I, I'm so
surprised to hear you say that.

780
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:27,731
(SIGHS) Actually, I...
I need to thank you.

781
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:28,164
What for?

782
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:32,635
Well, I have a new appreciation for
what Kat wants to do with her life.

783
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:37,106
I can't believe
I was being so dismissive.

784
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:40,476
I really am turning
into my mother.

785
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:42,244
Wow. That's wonderful.

786
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:47,349
Not that you were turning into your
mother, I mean that you would...

787
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:51,753
- You know what I mean.
- No, yeah, I do, I get it.

788
00:45:54,824 --> 00:45:55,255
Uh, so, uh...

789
00:45:55,257 --> 00:45:59,125
You still seeing that guy, the one
you weren't sure if you liked?

790
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:04,563
Oh, no, no, no, I...
Broke it off after our dinner.

791
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:08,466
- Since dinner, yeah.
- Oh.

792
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:10,667
So...

793
00:46:10,669 --> 00:46:14,270
- Oh, I have your blankets.
- Oh, thanks.

794
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,905
Holding these. (CHUCKLES)

795
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:24,279
Got you the soft ones that I had so
you can be comfortable out there.

796
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:28,148
These are really nice blankets.

797
00:46:28,383 --> 00:46:30,349
It's no problem.

798
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:34,786
Are you okay with me
standing this close?

799
00:46:34,954 --> 00:46:38,055
Yeah, I like it actually.

800
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:44,994
- Is this okay here? -This is,
this is good, I like it here.

801
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:58,973
- We probably shouldn't be doing this.
- No, we probably...

802
00:46:59,508 --> 00:47:01,474
- Okay, let's stop.
- Okay, let's stop.

803
00:47:01,476 --> 00:47:03,542
No, let's not.

804
00:47:04,211 --> 00:47:07,078
- You want to stop, say it.
- Stop.

805
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,480
- Gee, you smell so good.
- Yes...

806
00:47:09,482 --> 00:47:14,518
Okay, listen, we have to be quiet.
I don't want to wake up the kids.

807
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,420
(WHISPERING) Yeah, okay,
I'm going to be so quiet.

808
00:47:17,855 --> 00:47:19,788
Well, not too quiet,
I like to be affirmed.

809
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:24,492
Okay, I'll be whispering
affirmations at you.

810
00:47:26,229 --> 00:47:26,894
Wait a minute.

811
00:47:26,896 --> 00:47:30,330
- I have to tell you something.
- Something wrong?

812
00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:34,500
No, I just...
I want to just say...

813
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:38,804
- No bullshit, okay?
- Oh, yeah... No.

814
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:41,472
I mean I, uh...

815
00:47:41,474 --> 00:47:42,706
I'm a big girl and...

816
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:47,944
I don't need this to be anything
more than what it is, but just...

817
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:50,446
Don't bullshit me.

818
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:57,151
Do you understand,
I've been through enough.

819
00:47:57,219 --> 00:47:59,519
Yeah, I understand.

820
00:47:59,521 --> 00:48:03,022
- I've been hurt, too.
- I know.

821
00:48:03,024 --> 00:48:05,290
I could tell the minute we met.

822
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:07,191
It's actually one of the first
things I liked about you.

823
00:48:07,193 --> 00:48:11,595
That's funny. Do you know one of the
first things I liked about you was?

824
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,862
- What?
- Your tits.

825
00:48:12,864 --> 00:48:17,066
That's so nice.
Please touch them.

826
00:48:19,537 --> 00:48:22,538
(DIANE LAUGHING)

827
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,277
- CLIO: Daddy?
- Oh, no, no...

828
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:33,647
- You have to go get her.
- Daddy, are you there?

829
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:35,348
No, no, no, no, no.

830
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,352
- Okay, I'm going to be right back.
- Okay.

831
00:48:39,354 --> 00:48:42,154
I'll be here. (SIGHS)

832
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:44,288
Hey.

833
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,255
Where were you?

834
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:48,992
I was, uh, just getting some
blankets from Kat's mom.

835
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:52,762
She's invited us all to
have a sleep-over tonight.

836
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:54,263
Isn't that fun?

837
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,531
Where are the blankets?

838
00:48:58,067 --> 00:49:02,069
Let's go, let's, um, get
you back to bed.

839
00:49:19,354 --> 00:49:23,889
- Where are you going?
- Just stretching.

840
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:09,267
Well, this is wildly
inappropriate.

841
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:15,405
Oh... Hey, Kat.

842
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:16,873
Hi, good morning.

843
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,140
Where have you been all night?

844
00:50:18,142 --> 00:50:20,242
What? None of your business!

845
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:22,277
Is your, uh, is your mom up?

846
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:23,511
Actually, no, she just
left for work,

847
00:50:23,513 --> 00:50:26,547
but she did tell me
to tell you good-bye.

848
00:50:26,882 --> 00:50:28,381
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

849
00:50:28,383 --> 00:50:29,648
How did she say it?

850
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,149
"Tell him I said bye."

851
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:33,317
Do you know where my
children are?

852
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:35,352
Yeah, they're in the kitchen,
eating breakfast.

853
00:50:35,354 --> 00:50:37,454
Okay, good. Good.

854
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:39,956
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

855
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,424
Yeah, no, it's fine.

856
00:50:41,426 --> 00:50:45,728
Actually, I really like your kids.
They are very, very fun.

857
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,529
Yeah. Thank you.

858
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:50,532
Uh, I want to make it up to you.
How does $20 sound?

859
00:50:50,534 --> 00:50:53,868
Sounds like you don't know
how much to pay a baby-sitter.

860
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,737
How much,
uh, how much would you like?

861
00:50:58,474 --> 00:50:59,739
$350.

862
00:50:59,874 --> 00:51:02,040
- $350?
- Yeah!

863
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:03,741
Could you give me a month?

864
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:07,344
Um, you know, you...

865
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:11,114
Do you think you can
just read this? Please?

866
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:12,415
- If you have time?
- What is this?

867
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:15,484
- It's like a story I've been working
on for like forever. -Uh-huh.

868
00:51:15,486 --> 00:51:18,620
Um, I don't know actually,
it's pretty dumb,

869
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:19,487
it's not like,
really finished, so...

870
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:21,202
No, I'll read it. No,
I'd love to read it.

871
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:22,556
No that's fine, I'll take it.

872
00:51:22,558 --> 00:51:23,590
I'd love to read it.

873
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:26,893
- You would? -Sure, it
would be my pleasure.

874
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:28,628
Thank you.

875
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,097
Um, now get out of my room.

876
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:32,598
Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.

877
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,702
And take the sheets
with you, please. Burn them.

878
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:40,871
COLETTE: Dad, why did we sleep
at Kat's last night?

879
00:51:41,206 --> 00:51:44,540
Because, uh, you guys fell asleep
and I didn't want to wake you.

880
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:47,476
- Do you like her?
- Who, Kat? Of course I do.

881
00:51:47,478 --> 00:51:51,179
- I like all my students.
- Are you going to marry her?

882
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:53,981
No! She's only 19!

883
00:51:55,684 --> 00:51:58,317
(WHISPERING) I'm not
going to marry her.

884
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,387
Okay, have a great day, girls.

885
00:52:03,056 --> 00:52:04,588
Hey, what's wrong?

886
00:52:05,724 --> 00:52:06,355
What did I do?

887
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,423
We don't want you to marry Kat.

888
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,191
I'm not going to marry Kat.

889
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:13,727
- I miss Mommy!
- Oh, my God.

890
00:52:14,229 --> 00:52:15,995
Come here.

891
00:52:17,565 --> 00:52:19,331
It's okay.

892
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:36,380
- Hi!
- Was it today?

893
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:39,916
- No, I'm in a fitting.
- Oh.

894
00:52:39,918 --> 00:52:41,050
What are you doing here?

895
00:52:41,052 --> 00:52:44,286
- Can we, can we talk?
- Yeah.

896
00:52:54,131 --> 00:52:57,966
- Are you going to sit?
- I can't sit in this.

897
00:52:58,435 --> 00:53:02,937
Okay, well...
You look really good.

898
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:06,906
Oh... (CHUCKLES)
I don't know, I...

899
00:53:06,908 --> 00:53:09,041
I'm gonna be showing
so much by this wedding.

900
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:10,742
I feel like I should
wear something that

901
00:53:10,744 --> 00:53:14,312
reveals more leg, kind of
distract from the belly.

902
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:18,582
- So, you wanted to talk to me
about something? -Yeah, I...

903
00:53:18,584 --> 00:53:21,785
I just think that the kids
are very confused.

904
00:53:21,787 --> 00:53:23,286
Why? What have you been
doing to them?

905
00:53:23,288 --> 00:53:25,221
I haven't been doing
anything to them.

906
00:53:25,223 --> 00:53:28,557
They weren't confused when I
dropped them off at your place.

907
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,725
No, I'm not sure that's true.

908
00:53:30,727 --> 00:53:31,492
What do you mean?

909
00:53:31,494 --> 00:53:34,528
I just think the girls are
struggling with all of the changes

910
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,695
that are going on
at the moment.

911
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:40,232
- Which changes? -Like, you
know, like, all of the...

912
00:53:41,268 --> 00:53:42,734
Changes.

913
00:53:43,236 --> 00:53:46,237
- Are you seeing someone?
- What?

914
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,540
Oh, my God,
you're seeing someone!

915
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:53,143
Oh, well, I wouldn't... I wouldn't
say we're seeing each other.

916
00:53:53,145 --> 00:53:57,847
Unbelievable! I can't believe you pick
the one week I give you the girls

917
00:53:57,849 --> 00:53:58,981
to start seeing someone?

918
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:00,515
I thought you
wanted me to date.

919
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:02,683
How old is she?
I hope she's not a student.

920
00:54:02,685 --> 00:54:06,653
- She's not a student, she's
a student's mother. -Wow.

921
00:54:06,655 --> 00:54:08,154
Where were the girls
when you were with her?

922
00:54:08,156 --> 00:54:12,925
They were sleeping in her
daughter's bed, the student...

923
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:15,093
Oh, right, okay...

924
00:54:15,528 --> 00:54:16,460
No wonder they're confused.

925
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:19,930
Well that... Yeah, that sounds
bad, but it's not like that.

926
00:54:19,932 --> 00:54:24,034
No, it's, it's fine. I, I love
that you're seeing somebody.

927
00:54:24,036 --> 00:54:26,603
- I think that's awesome.
- I'm not seeing...

928
00:54:26,605 --> 00:54:28,571
Look, this isn't
about me or you.

929
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:29,939
I just want the kids
to be happy.

930
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:32,441
I thought happiness was not
a sustainable condition?

931
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:34,042
You're absolutely correct,
it's not.

932
00:54:34,044 --> 00:54:35,777
But I don't think they
need to live in chaos.

933
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:39,680
There is nothing chaotic about the
world I provide for my girls.

934
00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:42,416
You left their father
on their fifth birthday.

935
00:54:42,418 --> 00:54:45,133
Now you're marrying the
guy who broke us up.

936
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:46,520
Their nanny left them.

937
00:54:46,522 --> 00:54:47,521
- Have you told them?
- Okay.

938
00:54:47,523 --> 00:54:48,989
You haven't told them, have you?
Have you told them?

939
00:54:48,991 --> 00:54:51,324
- Have you... You haven't
told them yet? -Stop!

940
00:54:51,326 --> 00:54:52,591
You drop them off
at my place on a whim.

941
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:54,960
I think their lives
are pretty fucking chaotic!

942
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:55,660
- Here!
- What is this?

943
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:57,728
The girls' schedules.
French, cello, tap.

944
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,262
Museum Mondays.
Alternate cooking play-dates

945
00:54:59,264 --> 00:55:01,030
with the Sheldon girls
every Thursday afternoon.

946
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,132
Oral storytelling workshop
for spring break.

947
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:04,133
Then there's breakfast
and dinner every day.

948
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:07,336
Cello practice every day. Reading
them to sleep for an hour every day.

949
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,438
Don't tell me their
lives are chaotic!

950
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,739
Well, I'm glad you
feed them regularly.

951
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:11,973
I'm not implying that
you're a bad mother.

952
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,009
- I'm a great fucking mother.
- I know you are.

953
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,910
Their lives have never been
chaotic with me.

954
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,879
It's my life that's been chaotic
because I was unhappy for years

955
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:19,813
and didn't do
anything about it.

956
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:23,449
Because first I was taking care of you,
and then I was taking care of them...

957
00:55:23,451 --> 00:55:25,250
And no one was
ever taking care of me!

958
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:28,386
Well, I'm sorry I didn't know you
wanted to take improv classes.

959
00:55:28,388 --> 00:55:30,788
- Fuck you!
- Charlie...

960
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,156
I could be so much more
than what I am.

961
00:55:32,158 --> 00:55:34,958
What does that mean? I don't
even know what that means.

962
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,793
Of course you don't. God!

963
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:37,960
Of course you don't! God!

964
00:55:37,962 --> 00:55:41,897
I can't believe you're dating
a student's mother!

965
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:45,766
We're not dating.

966
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,168
Do you like her?

967
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,004
I told you, I barely know her.

968
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:54,339
I think you like her.

969
00:56:04,417 --> 00:56:06,750
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

970
00:56:48,226 --> 00:56:50,993
COLETTE: Dad, who
are you texting?

971
00:56:51,228 --> 00:56:52,794
- No one.
- Is it Kat?

972
00:56:52,796 --> 00:56:55,029
No, it's not Kat.

973
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,268
- (WILL SIGHS)
- DIANE: Hmm.

974
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:03,770
WILL: This is a really
nice office.

975
00:57:03,772 --> 00:57:06,572
DIANE: Yeah, I thought
you would like it.

976
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,039
I do.

977
00:57:08,107 --> 00:57:08,672
I actually do, I mean,

978
00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:13,076
I'm not using it as a euphemism,
I do like your office, really.

979
00:57:13,078 --> 00:57:17,947
You know I believed you, I
didn't receive it negatively.

980
00:57:19,116 --> 00:57:23,051
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

981
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,488
What happened
with you and your...

982
00:57:28,224 --> 00:57:30,724
- My baby mama?
- (CHUCKLES)

983
00:57:30,726 --> 00:57:33,460
Please don't ever say
"baby mama" again.

984
00:57:33,462 --> 00:57:34,661
(DEEPLY) My baby mama...

985
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:37,430
- Don't! You sound...
- She's my baby mama.

986
00:57:37,432 --> 00:57:39,932
(LAUGHING) That's three times.

987
00:57:40,434 --> 00:57:42,200
I don't know.

988
00:57:42,202 --> 00:57:43,834
You don't know?

989
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:46,402
We were always very different.

990
00:57:46,404 --> 00:57:49,571
And it was really
fun at first, and then,

991
00:57:50,106 --> 00:57:54,475
gradually, less and less fun
as it went on.

992
00:57:55,377 --> 00:57:57,310
Different how?

993
00:57:57,445 --> 00:58:02,815
Lots of ways, she was outgoing.
I was quite.

994
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:06,051
- Hmm.
- She had money and I didn't.

995
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:08,053
Hmm, that's a big one.

996
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:09,521
It wasn't that.

997
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:12,790
Charlie was always
generous with what she had.

998
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:18,862
She actually gave up everything so
that I could concentrate on my comics.

999
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:21,898
She had so much
confidence in me.

1000
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,402
Probably more than I had
in myself at that time.

1001
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:29,037
So, what went wrong?

1002
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,040
I guess she just
she stopped talking.

1003
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:35,476
And I enjoyed
the silence too much.

1004
00:58:39,014 --> 00:58:42,281
What happened with you
and your ex?

1005
00:58:42,283 --> 00:58:46,184
Oh, it's...
It's not that interesting.

1006
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:50,454
He was just a fucking
asshole. (SIGHS)

1007
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:53,790
Mmm.

1008
00:58:56,728 --> 00:58:59,261
Who can tell me what this is?

1009
00:58:59,263 --> 00:58:59,961
A pipe.

1010
00:58:59,963 --> 00:59:04,031
Hasn't anyone here ever
taken an art history class?

1011
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:06,366
All right, does anyone
speak French?

1012
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:07,567
Is it a French pipe?

1013
00:59:07,569 --> 00:59:09,235
It's <i> The Treachery of</i>
<i>Images</i> by Magritte.

1014
00:59:09,237 --> 00:59:12,638
Those words say, "This is
not a pipe" in French.

1015
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,272

the opposite of what we're seeing.

01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:36,324
so if that's any consolation.

1361
01:19:36,326 --> 01:19:37,558
Well...

1362
01:19:38,928 --> 01:19:40,227
Do you know where she is?

1363
01:19:40,229 --> 01:19:42,495
Nobody... Nobody can find her,

1364
01:19:42,497 --> 01:19:44,196
she's not answering her phone.

1365
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:45,664
Are you serious?

1366
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:46,731
Why would I kid about that?

1367
01:19:46,733 --> 01:19:48,399
Well, I don't know,
I don't know you.

1368
01:19:48,401 --> 01:19:50,401
I don't know
your sense of humor.

1369
01:19:50,403 --> 01:19:51,902
I'm not kidding.

1370
01:19:53,305 --> 01:19:54,771
(SIGHS)

1371
01:19:56,941 --> 01:19:59,741
Hey, I love her, you know?

1372
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:04,144
Yeah.

1373
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:06,211
I know now.

1374
01:20:20,193 --> 01:20:22,059
- You came.
- I came.

1375
01:20:22,061 --> 01:20:24,194
Your pants are too short.

1376
01:20:24,196 --> 01:20:25,828
Yeah, I just got them.

1377
01:20:26,764 --> 01:20:28,530
You look good.

1378
01:20:28,798 --> 01:20:30,898
There are people
looking for you.

1379
01:20:32,434 --> 01:20:34,033
And only you know
where to find me.

1380
01:20:34,035 --> 01:20:37,536
It kind of helped that you
texted me where you were.

1381
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:41,806
What are you doing?

1382
01:20:41,808 --> 01:20:44,608
I'm afraid
I'm making another mistake.

1383
01:20:46,244 --> 01:20:49,144
I don't think of what we did
as a mistake.

1384
01:20:49,446 --> 01:20:51,179
It didn't work out.

1385
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:52,813
It did...

1386
01:20:52,815 --> 01:20:54,648
And then it didn't.

1387
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:57,417
What does that mean?

1388
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:58,684
It means... (SIGHS)

1389
01:20:58,686 --> 01:21:01,319
We can't predict
what's going to happen.

1390
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:03,721
Or how we're going to change.

1391
01:21:11,564 --> 01:21:13,497
I love you.

1392
01:21:14,933 --> 01:21:16,499
I love you, too.

1393
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:20,269
But if you wait any longer, you're
going to miss your wedding.

1394
01:21:21,472 --> 01:21:23,138
Are we friends?

1395
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,139
We're more than that.

1396
01:21:25,241 --> 01:21:27,007
What are we?

1397
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:30,343
We're parents.

1398
01:21:38,152 --> 01:21:40,185

- CLIO: No.
