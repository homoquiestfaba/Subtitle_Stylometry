00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
[shovel thudding]

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
[man panting]

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
[thudding continues]

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
[water splashing]

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
[Herschel]  In old country of Schlupsk, I am ditch digger.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It is not always great.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Life is difficult.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But then one day,

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hashem gives me a miracle.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
[Herschel]  Her name is Sarah.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She is strong

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and she has all her teeth, top and bottom.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I decide at once to woo her.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
[speaking foreign language]

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
[speaking Yiddish]

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
[Herschel]  Wooing fails,

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but I am determined to win her.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Every day, I dig twice the ditch.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It is greatest summer of my life.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We have so much in common.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Her favorite color black. My favorite color black.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Her parents murdered by Cossacks.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My parents murdered by Cossacks.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I notice nice little thing about her.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She always sneeze same way.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Four time.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Is adorable.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sometimes, when we want to be alone,

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we go to very special bog.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We tell each other all our hopes and dreams.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
[Sarah speaking foreign language]

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
[chuckles]

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
[both chuckling]

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
[sighs]

37
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
[Herschel]  We have wedding in front of whole town.

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hashem blesses us.

39
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
[shouts in foreign language]

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
[Herschel]  For a bit.

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We are attacked by Cossacks.

42
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Bloodthirsty, Jew-hungry,

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Russian maniacs drunk from vodka.

44
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Jew!

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
-[sword swishing] -[indistinct shouting]

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
[Herschel]  The Cossacks destroy our whole world.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But...

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
we are the Greenbaums.

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We are strong.

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And together there is no stopping us.

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We keep fighting till we have American dream.

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
[man] All right, let's get these

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
dumb Polacks outta here.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
[child screams]

55
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
[Herschel] Compared to Cossacks,

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Americans very kind.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
[man] All right. This way, you filthy Jews. Let's go.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
[Herschel]  I find good job in pickle factory.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
A good Jewish business.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The foreman will not let me mix salt.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Or sort cucumber.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But he says I can chase rats with club

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and he will pay nickel for every ten Herschel smash.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
[rat squeaking]

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
[grunts]

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
[Herschel] It is not dream job.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But I am grateful for chance to prove my worth.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Get your seltzer water here! Just one bright, shiny nickel.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
[Herschel]  Some things still out of reach.

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Seltzer water. Get your seltzer water!

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, you, sir. Seltzer water today?

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's only one bright, shiny nickel for the men.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's only one bright, shiny nickel for the ladies.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
[Herschel]  But over time we work and save.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I grant Sarah's wish.

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
A beautiful Greenbaum family plot

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
for us to share.

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Forever.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then Hashem gives us biggest miracle of all.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So one night to Sarah

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I make this vow.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Our child will be strong.

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And our child's child will be strong.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Our family will prosper.

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And in 100 years,

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the Greenbaums will be powerful.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Successful.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The strongest in the land.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
[Herschel] And then one day,

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
everything changed.

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
[rats squeaking]

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
[squeaking]

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
[screaming]

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Attention!

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This factory has been condemned.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
[indistinct chatter]

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
[thuds]

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
-Damn it. -Shit.

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
[boy 1] Dude, we're never gonna find this, bro.

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
[boy 2] No, it's definitely this way.

101
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Whoa.

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
[lid clattering]

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
[all screaming]

104
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
[boy] Let's go!

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
[breathing heavily]

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
-[indistinct chatter] -[cameras flashing]

107
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Please! Please! Settle down.

108
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Essentially, the pickle brine preserved him perfectly.

109
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's been 100 years, but he hasn't aged a day.

110
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
-That's impossible. -You don't honestly expect us

111
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
to buy that, do you?

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's the science behind it?

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please, let me explain.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
[Herschel] The scientist explains.

115
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
His logic is good.

116
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It satisfies everyone.

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
-Oh, yes. -It makes sense.

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
-Absolutely. -Very clear.

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
[Herschel]  But...

120
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm very sad.

121
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The world has changed.

122
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Everything I know is gone. And...

123
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
...everyone.

124
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
[doctor] I'm so sorry, Herschel.

125
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You will check again.

126
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We already checked the city records twice.

127
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She wasn't brined.

128
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She's been dead for 80 years.

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You will check again.

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We already checked.

131
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
[grunts]

132
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
[alarm beeping]

133
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
[Herschel] My Sarah is gone.

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Our child is gone.

135
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I have nothing.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then I get some great news.

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Great news, Herschel.

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It took a little bit of doing,

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
but we were able to track down a living relative.

140
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I have family?

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes.

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
A great-grandson.

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And, as luck would have it, he lives right here in Brooklyn

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and he's exactly the same age as you.

145
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
-His name is "Ben Greenbaum." -[sighs]

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And we're contacting him right now.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Thank you.

148
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
[Herschel]  I am so excited I forget all my misery.

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Even though I have not met this Ben,

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I can see him in my mind.

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He will be just like how I vowed to Sarah,

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
powerful.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Successful.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The strongest in the land.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
[man speaking indistinctly]

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
[man sneezes four times]

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
-[woman] Bless you. -[man] Oh, I'm sorry.

158
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Excuse me.

159
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Greenbaum.

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

161
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Greenbaum.

162
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Greenbaum.

163
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Greenbaum.

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Greenbaum!

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Greenbaum!

166
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Greenbaum!

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
[laughs]

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All right!

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is nuts. [laughs]

170
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It must be so crazy for you.

171
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Very crazy.

172
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Crazy for me, too, man.

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you allowed to leave?

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you wanna come back to my apartment?

175
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
-Very much. -All right. Let's go.

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
[Ben] Yeah, I got him. I'm his great-grandson.

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So he's gonna stay with me for a bit. Yeah. Thank you.

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
[car honking]

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
[Ben] Take it in.

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Cool, huh?

181
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Make way.

182
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
[Ben] It's a scooter.

183
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
They're actually pretty fun.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Anyway, I can't wait to show you, like, the future.

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There's so much cool shit, man. You're gonna love it.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
[horn honking]

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's cool, man. It's a cab.

188
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's gonna take us back to my apartment. Hop in.

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
[chuckles] It's all right.

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, yeah, crawl in.

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There you go. You got it.

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We're going to Brooklyn, please. Thank you.

193
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Here we are, man.

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Home, sweet home.

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey, check this out.

196
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Alexa, lights.

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Pretty cool, huh?

198
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
All this yours?

199
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah. I mean, I don't own it or anything like that.

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I do live here by myself. I work from home,

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
though, a lot.

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It would be nice, honestly, to have someone around.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So you can stay here as long as you want.

204
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I do not want to be burden to you.

205
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's not a burden, Herschel. At all. I mean...

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm amazed you're alive. [chuckles]

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I really never thought I would get a chance

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
to meet another Greenbaum. So...

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Neither did I.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You must be thirsty.

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean, you were brined for, like, a century.

212
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And there's salt in brine, right?

213
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So you must be pretty parched, to say the least.

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Can I get you something to drink?

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Macadamia milk? Or there's cashew milk.

216
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I got pea milk. They're milking peas now.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They're milking everything these days, dude.

218
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You name it, they're milking it.

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I got mint tea. I have kombucha.

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
-"Kombucha"? -Yeah.

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's fermented... stuff. Honestly, I don't even know.

222
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Tastes nasty. But it's very healthy.

223
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
-Would you like some? -Is fine.

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They inject drink into my arm in hospital.

225
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
-I am fine. -Fair enough.

226
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There must be something I can get you.

227
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Would you like some seltzer?

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You have seltzer.

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, I got seltzer for days, son.

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I got a whole seltzer machine. It's pretty cool, actually.

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ya just fill this up there.

232
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's it. You put in the cartridge.

233
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
"Cartridge."

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And you just press that button. Makes you seltzer.

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Press button.

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Exactly. You wanna press it?

237
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You'll let me press seltzer button?

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah. It's a pretty big deal, but we're family.

239
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So you can press the seltzer button.

240
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Knock yourself out.

241
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah!

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There you go. You're seltzering.

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Pretty cool, huh?

244
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
-The bubble. -So many bubbles.

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well...

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
One for you. And one for me.

247
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Cheers.

248
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
L'chaim.

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Ooh!

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
[chuckles]

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah.

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Lots of bubbles. [chuckles]

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Crazy.

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This must be very overwhelming for you.

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's a lot. It's a little much.

256
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But I think you'll find there's actually, like,

257
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
some pretty cool stuff about the future.

258
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
[scoffing]

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, yeah. Exactly. Not just that.

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Uh, I know what else you might like.

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You like music, right?

262
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes.

That is a weirdly inappropriate thing to say.

How many pairs of shoes you own?

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Um, like seven, maybe?

313
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Seven. How many sock?

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I have like 20, 25 pairs of socks.

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
[chuckles]

316
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Twenty-five socks! Twenty-five.

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's a lot of socks.

Wait, let me guess. You're a doctor.

324
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No. You're a lawyer.

325
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No.

326
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Close. Freelance mobile app developer.

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What?

328
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Check it out, man.

332
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Go.

333
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
A magic rectangle. You make this?

334
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, I didn't invent the iPad. I wish I did, though.

335
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But let me ask you this,

336
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
before people buy something

337
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
what's something they wish they knew?

338
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
How long has meat been dead for?

339
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, that.

340
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Also, they want to know

341
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
whether or not the company they're buying from is ethical.

342
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
-They do? -Yes.

343
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They do. It's called "conscientious shopping."

344
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's very popular.

345
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
My app makes it very easy.

346
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
All you do is, you scan a product.

347
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And it tells you whether or not the company is ethical

348
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
by analyzing its carbon footprint,

349
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
its labor policies,

350
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and a bunch of other things and it gives you a score.

351
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000

These kale chips are gonna be extra delicious

354
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
because I know how ethical they are.

355
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Thanks to Boop Bop.

356
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
-"Boop Bop"? -Boop Bop, yeah.

357
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
-It's called "Boop Bop." -Why Boop Bop?

358
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Um...

359
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You know, it's kinda just like the trend,

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I guess, these days

361
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
to give apps, like, silly names.

362
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You know, Venmo, Hulu, Hipmunk and...

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You know, you might think it's kinda silly.

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But I've been working on it pretty hard

365
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
for five years now, basically.

366
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And once I sell this thing, I can finally, you know,

367
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
start the next chapter, which is exciting.

368
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You work for five years. How come you no sell?

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's just...

370
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
not ready yet.

371
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm still finalizing some things.

372
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Just really focused on getting it right, you know?

373
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Making it perfect.

374
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think once it's ready, though, I'll have

375
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
a pretty easy time selling it.

376
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I went to school with this guy who works in venture capital.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And I'm pretty sure he'd be into it.

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He said that they wanna hear the pitch as soon as it's done.

379
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But I'm still kind of noodling with the logo.

380
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I mean, this mustardy one has really been growing on me.

381
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I kinda wish it was mustardier, though.

382
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Is this your father?

383
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No, that's David Bowie.

384
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is this your mother?

385
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No, that's also David Bowie.

386
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That whole poster's David Bowie.

387
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
How come in this whole place you have so many things,

388
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
but no pictures of family?

389
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I have pictures of my family.

390
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I just haven't really,

391
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
you know, like, framed them and incorporated them in my...

392
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
design.

393
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But I got that stuff right here.

394
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
[sighs]

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You kept.

396
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah. I kept.

397
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
[exhales heavily]

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Who is this?

399
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's...

400
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
your son.

401
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's Mort Greenbaum.

402
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
"Mort"?

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
[sighs]

404
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Sarah had son.

405
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
How was his life?

406
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Was he success?

407
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah. He was a foreman of a brick factory.

408
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
A foreman?

409
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah.

410
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Who is this?

411
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Uh...

412
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's Mort's son.

413
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
David Greenbaum. Your grandson.

414
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
He was also foreman?

415
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
He was an accountant.

416
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
-Accountant. -Yeah.

417
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This his wife?

418
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Mm-hmm.

419
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Who is this very shapely young woman here?

420
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's me.

421
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
These are your parents.

422
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Where are they?

423
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They passed away.

424
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm very sorry.

425
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Murdered or regular?

426
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It was a car crash.

427
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So, regular.

428
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You will tell me everything of their death

429
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
so I may bear witness to your grief.

430
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
How their bodies died, their faces as the life left.

431
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Be very specific.

432
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Spare no detail.

433
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We will bond over our pain.

434
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
No detail too small.

435
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We don't have to get into that right now.

436
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You wanna get outta here? Let's go to Smorgasburg.

437
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
They have jackfruit nachos that are actually really good.

438
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We will go to cemetery now.

439
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Visit Greenbaum family grave, pay our respect to dead.

440
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Actually, I'm not sure...

441
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't think the cemetery's open right now.

442
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So we go to cemetery tomorrow.

443
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I think it was maybe supposed to rain.

444
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So I guess weather permitting.

445
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
All right. But now we go to shul,

446
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
we say Mourner's Kaddish, prayer for dead.

447
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Must properly honor memory of Sarah, Mort, your parents.

448
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yeah, I'm not...

449
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm not sure that's something I want to do right now.

450
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But I would be happy to walk you over there.

451
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What is problem?

452
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not a problem.

453
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I guess I understand why you're a religious person.

454
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That makes sense for someone from your era.

455
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But I am not...

456
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm not very religious.

457
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You do not know Mourner's Kaddish?

458
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
[clicks tongue]

459
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Not anymore, no.

460
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
How do you grieve for dead parents

461
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
if you do not say prayer for dead?

462
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm doing okay.

463
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I do not understand.

464
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You were raised Jew.

465
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah.

466
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Are you not still Jew?

467
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Technically.

468
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I also had a Jumanji-themed bar mitzvah.

469
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's not like I was that religious

470
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
in the first place.

471
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Also, like, organized religion is very regressive.

472
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
[sighs]

473
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Praise Hashem, there is still beautiful Greenbaum plot.

474
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Very special place. Very special.

475
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Tell me, how high is elm tree now?

476
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
100 feet?

477
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
200 feet?

478
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah. Something like that. Probably. I'm not 100% sure.

479
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
When last time you come?

480
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't know, maybe like five years ago, or somethin'.

481
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So been a little while.

482
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Wait.

483
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's this way.

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This way!

485
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Sweet Hashem.

486
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You let them put garbage.

487
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And you let them put huge sign block out sun and kill tree!

488
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah, it's not on our property.

489
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
There's nothing we can do about it.

490
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Sarah.

491
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
[Herschel sniffles]

492
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You okay?

493
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We will pray.

494
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
[praying in foreign language]

495
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Hey, guys!

496
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Sorry, you can't be there.

497
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What?

498
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
We're putting up a billboard!

499
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
[Herschel] What it say?

500
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's an ad for vanilla-flavored vodka.

501
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Vanilla-flavored...

502
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
...vodka?

503
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Cossacks.

504
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Cossack!

505
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Hershel, what are you doin', man?

506
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You will take down vanilla vodka...

507
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
or I will do violence.

508
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
What?

509
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You will take down vanilla vodka...

510
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
or I will do violence.

511
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Look, buddy, I don't have time for--

512
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Oh, shit. No!

513
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
[grunting]

514
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
-Stop! -Yes!

515
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Stop!

516
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Come on! Come on!

517
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Ben! Ben!

518
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Come on!

519
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You can never stop the Greenbaums!

520
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You will never stop the Greenbaums!

521
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
[door buzzes]

522
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Your payment's been processed. You're free to go.

523
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Fantastic.

524
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We must go back to grave.

525
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We will cut down Cossack billboard.

526
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Dude, if we do that,

527
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
we're gonna go back to jail. So, no.

528
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Okay. We must purchase billboard from Cossack,

529
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
which I do not like,

530
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and then we cut down billboard.

531
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
First off, the Cossacks don't own it.

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Second off, it's owned by some giant billboard company.

533
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It costs $200,000.

534
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Then we buy from giant company and then we cut down billboard.

535
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Why are you being so difficult about this?

536
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I can't afford it!

537
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You have moneys? Your parents leave you moneys?

538
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't have $200,000.

539
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You have all this, so you have moneys.

540
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
How much moneys you have?

541
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I have some money left, but I don't have a lot left.

542
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And I have a lot less now that I had to bail us

543
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
out of jail, Herschel.

544
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's not my fault!

545
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
What is your fault is that you started a fight with

546
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
some construction workers!

547
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Someone has to defend honor of family. Not you.

548
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And I'd be defending the honor of our family more

549
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
if I wasn't busy trying to create a company

550
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and a product, man!

551
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You're busy? Oh, yes. Not selling Boop Bops.

You don't understand how much pressure there is

553
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
on this stuff. Okay?

554
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm trying to make it perfect.

555
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Blue. Green. Red. Who cares?

556
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Pick a color!

557

Companies are made or broken by the color of their logo!

558
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Let me tell you something.

559
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
In Schlupsk, we have saying.

560
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, good. Yeah, what is it? I'm sure this has aged well.

561
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
If man says he is going to throw punch,

562
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
but he does not throw punch,

563
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
it is because this man secretly has polio arm.

564
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
This is you.

565
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You have polio arm.

566
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
This your polio arm.

567
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Throw your punch!

568
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Do something, Ben!

569
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Don't just sit there, looking at Boop Bops.

You know they cured polio, right?

579
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
-They did? -Yes, they did.

580
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
A long time ago. A guy named Jonas Salk.

581
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Was he Jew?

582
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
He was. Yes.

583
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
-He was Jewish? -Yes.

584
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yes! Knew it.

585
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, yeah, big win.

586
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I would look at polio people and think,

587
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
"They could fix this."

588
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You thought that?

589
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
This problem not unfixable problem.

590
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You put a Jew on this, he will fix this.

591
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Very prophetic of you, Herschel.

592
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I was right. Very good.

He says my idea's "straight fire."

That's a good thing.

He wants me to come in today and pitch my idea in person.

Hey! How's it going, man?

603
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
We're not gonna invest.

-What? -Yeah. Sorry, man.

605
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What's the problem?

606
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Before you came in, we googled your name

607
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and the first thing that comes up is your arrest.

608
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Look, it's just bad optics.

609
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I mean, the whole app is about ethics,

610
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and the founder is a violent criminal.

611
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Like, if you Boop Bopped Boop Bop,

612
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
you'd get a really low Boop Bop score.

613
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Is there anything we can do?

614
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Can we spin this or something like that?

615
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Oh, no. Definitely not.

616
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
No one's gonna touch this, man. This is...

617

-Five years.

Five years. That's--

Sorry to disappoint you, I guess.

627
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Maybe you can make an app where it doesn't matter

628
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
if the founder's a bad person.

629
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000

Hey. I don't know if you want my advice, man,

but it's never too late to do things completely differently.

No. I didn't get moneys.

And I'm afraid that I might never get moneys

640
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
for my business that is based on ethics

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
now that I have a criminal record for assault

I was worried no one would want your Boop Bops

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
because is terrible idea. So...

645
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I have other idea.

646
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
We start pickle business.

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Ew!

735
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Also, you bring back jar when you finish.

736
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
-He reclaims his jars. He reclaims his jars.

737
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
-Wow.

738
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
There is nothing wrong with used jar.

739
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
They same after many, many use.

740
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Amen to that!

741
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
-Amen. -Amen.

742
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You are religious.

743
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Amen! Well, thank you so much. Have a good day.

744
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Don't forget bring back jar.

745
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Or I will find you, and I will do

746
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
terrible violence.

747
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You know what? You should do a post on him.

748
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh. Yeah. How could I not?

Yeah, not fantastic.

763
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I found out I gotta basically throw away

764
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000

-Bummer. -Yeah. Big bummer.

767
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
But I'll think of something.

768
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
[Herschel] It's about the smell.

769
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You know is good.

770
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Pickles should smell like vomit.

771
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Excuse me, what is that?

772
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's a blog post about that old-timey pickle guy

773
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
over on  Bedford.

774
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh, yeah. I heard about that guy.

775
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's crazy, right? Look, here, check it out.

776
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Herschel's jars have no label,

777
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and his product doesn't even have a name.

778
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But he just might be the most authentic

779
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
artisanal pickler in all of Williamsburg.

780
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And his accent is cute AF.

781
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Hello.

782
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Aww! Oh, my God!

783
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So he uses, like, repurposed pickle jars,

784
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
cucumbers, salt and rainwater, and that's it.

785
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Time to invest right now, right?

786
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Is this a popular blog?

787
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
This video's got like a million views,

788
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
so people are loving this pickle guy.

789
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Maybe we should sell those here.

790
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Picklebacks, pickle shots. That's cool, right?

791
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
[man] Looks cool.

-[woman] Aw, I love his hat. -[man] I know.

793
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Herschel, your pickles are the hottest thing in Brooklyn.

794
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
How does it feel to be such a runaway success?

795
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Ben Greenbaum, you see me now on your television box.

796
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Well, I become huge success.

797
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Soon I buy back Cossack billboard

798
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and I prove you are stupid.

799
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You are stupidest person I ever seen in my life.

800
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Wow, that Ben guy really sounds stupid.

801
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
...genius compared to you.

802
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
[clears throat]  Okay. Not sure who Ben is.

803
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Herschel, I understand your pickles are made

804
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
with rainwater.

805
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
-Rainwater, yes. -Yes.

806
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Rainwater from gutters.

807
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Nutrients from roof come off into jar.

808
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
[reporter]  There's bird droppings in there?

809
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
[Herschel]  All sorts of animal parts in here.

810
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Little essence of animal feet.

811
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Could you pull over, please?

812
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Hello. Health Department?

813
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I'd like to file a complaint.

814
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
-There you go. You take pickle.

815
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
-Gratitude.

816
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Are you Herschel Greenbaum?

817
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yes, 14 dollar for pickle.

818
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Ten dollar extra if you want telephone photograph

819
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
with the Herschel.

820
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Get in line.

821
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Listen, you're gonna have to shut this down immediately.

822
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Why shut down?

823
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Because you've got dozens of flagrant health violations.

824
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You can't just take food out of a garbage can

825
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and sell it to people.

826
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
-That's insane. -But is all-natural. Is vegan.

827
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
No benzoate. No preservative.

828
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You're lucky no one has died.

829
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You owe $12,000 in taxes, fees and fines.

830
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Till then, you are shut down.

-KEVIN: Yeah, what happened?

839
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I was shut down by evil woman.

840
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
They tell me I have to "bring things up to code."

841
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I do not know how to do this all by myself.

842
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
-You could scale up the business, right?

843
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
-True.

844
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
-Maybe hire some workers. -That's good.

845
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Cannot afford workers.

846
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You could get interns!

847
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
[Christian gasps] Yes.

848
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
"Interns"?

849
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, they're unpaid workers.

850
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Unpaid workers.

851
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Right. You compensate them in education and experience.

852
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Like slave?

853
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
No, no, no. That's not what I mean.

854
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That's a little bit of an oversimplification.

855
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Now, listen, Herschel. You run a small,

856
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
ethically conscious...

857
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Next.

858
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Mr. Greenbaum, I would just like to thank you in advance

859
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
for considering me for this internship.

Herschel is back!

866
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Gloves, here you go. Everyone needs gloves.

867
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That's the regulation.

868
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Like the beard tucked in. That's important!

869
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
All right. Let's get this up to code, people.

870
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Just pickling. No talking.

871
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
No!

872
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
No, no, no!

873
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Good pickle. Bad pickle. [grunts]

This is the goal.

879
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Perfect jar of pickle.

880

00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
-Yes, absolutely. Bottom.

916
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
My company doesn't even have a name yet, so I think

917
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
it's a little premature.

918
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Come on! You'll think of something.

919
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
[David]  You could just call it "Mom and Dad."

920
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
[Susan] You're so creative, inventive.

921
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
"Mom and Dad." I like that--

922
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
[banging]

923
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I have done it.

924
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I have restored honor to family and conquered the Cossacks.

925
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Congrats.

926
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Now I have some free time on my hands,

927
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
so I have good news.

928
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Herschel is back.

929
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I have decided I would come back

930
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
to be with you.

931
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Not for me. I am fine. Very stable.

932
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Not ups and downs. Herschel feel very happy

933
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
all the time.

934
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Oh, yeah?

935
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But for Ben, I figure maybe I come back and I help you.

936
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You have no wife, no children, no friends, and now no job.

937
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You need help!

938
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Herschel will help. Do not worry.

939
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Go away, Herschel. I don't want you here.

940
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Okay?

941
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Just please leave my apartment.

942
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
But I am only family you have left.

943
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You need Herschel.

944
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Without Herschel, you'll be all alone.

945
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
No one to fix broken life.

946
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
My life isn't broken, Herschel.

947
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'm fine. I'm completely happy.

948
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The only problem I have right now, honestly, is you.

949
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Just please go!

950
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
If you do not realize you need Herschel,

951
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
you are stupider than Polish person.

952
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And they are the stupidest.

953
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
How's your Twitter presence these days, Herschel?

954
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
What is Twitter?

955
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
"What is Twitter?" You don't know what Twitter is?

956
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Big, powerful pickle magnate like you doesn't know

957
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
what Twitter is?

958
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I might know what it is by other word.

959
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Well, maybe tell me what it is. Clarify.

960
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Twitter, you know, it's a marketplace of ideas

961
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
where the world's best and brightest come

962
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
to share their opinions

963
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
in a very measured and reasonable manner. Twitter.

964
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I will do Twitter.

965
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You probably think you can but it's very complicated.

966
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I don't think you'll get it.

967
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
-I can do anything. -I don't think you can.

968
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
-Can you do Twitter? -Oh, I can do Twitter.

969
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
If you can do Twitter, I can do Twitter.

970
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
In order to do Twitter really well,

971
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
you gotta be raw and uncensored

972
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and share your completely unfettered opinions.

973
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I don't think you'll be good at that.

974
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
-I will do Twitter! -Really? I don't know.

975
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You watch me, Ben! I will do Twitter.

976
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I will do Twitter better than anyone has ever

977
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
done Twitter.

978
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Well, I'll believe it when I see it, Herschel.

979
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You will see it. And you will believe it.

980
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Well, have at it, my friend!

981
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Watch.

982
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
[door closes]

983
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
[Clara]  Sir, some people hire a publicity team to help.

984
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
No help.

985
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I will be Twitter and nothing can stop me now.

986
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Now read me back my dictation.

987
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Okay.

988
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
"Wheelchair people,

989
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
-my pickles are so good... -Yes.

990
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
...it will make you forget Hashem has cursed you."

991
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Hashem has cursed their legs but not their mouths.

992
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
They can eat pickle.

993
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
-Is good. -Okay.

994
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
-Send to Twitter. -Sending.

995
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
"We sell to all peoples

996
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
even woman, unless they are menses,

997
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
in which case, stay in tent."

998
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Stay in tent.

999
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Next Twitter.

1000
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
-"Attention, sodomites." -Yes.

1001
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
"Hashem will smite you for your sin!

1002
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You will burn in flames for your crimes against God.

1003
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Buy my pickles."

1004
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Perfect to send.

1005
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Very good.

1006
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yep.

1007
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
[indistinct chatter]

1008
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Oh, lots of customers today.

1009
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Those are not customers. Those are protesters.

1010
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
-[woman 1] You're disgusting, man!

1011
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
-[woman 2] How dare you?

1012
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
"Protesters"?

1013
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
[man] Down with Herschel!

1014
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
[all] Down with Herschel!

1015
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Down with Herschel!

1016
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Down with Herschel!

1017
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Sir, as grateful as I am to you

1018
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
for this educational opportunity,

1019
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I am afraid that I can no longer

1020
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
continue this endeavor in good conscience.

1021
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Thank you for the college credit.

1022
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Clara!

1023
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
[indistinct shouting]

1024
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Down with Herschel! Down with Herschel!

1025
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You traitor!

1026
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
After everything I do for you!

1027
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
[mouthing] I'm sorry.

1028
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Down with Herschel!

1029
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Go away! Go away!

1030
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
[narrator] Who is Herschel Greenbaum?

1031
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And what is he selling?

1032
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Is it pickles?

1033
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Or is it hate?

1034
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Greenbaum's tweets are so outrageous,

1035
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
they seem almost designed to cause offense.

1036
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You're insane!

1037
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
[narrator]  He's drawing protests and boycotts.

1038
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
But maybe that's the point.

1039
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Some view him as a hateful bigot

1040
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
with rage in his heart.

1041
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Others see him as a defender of free speech,

1042
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
a clever provocateur testing the limits

1043
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
of the First Amendment.

1044
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
[woman]  Look, I get it. He's saying

1045
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
some controversial things

1046
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
but he's religious, so I believe him.

1047
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
He's what we need right now.

1048
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
[man]  Everybody in the mainstream media's like,

1049
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
"Herschel's this terrible person."

1050
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I think they got it all wrong.

1051
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
He's playing chess. Everybody else

1052
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
is playing checkers.

1053
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
[narrator]  Tonight, we'll find out who

1054
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Herschel Greenbaum really is

1055
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
from the man himself, Herschel Greenbaum.

1056
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Tell me, Herschel. How do you respond

1057
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
to those who have called your belief system abhorrent?

1058
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I would tell these people

1059
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I do not understand what this word means.

1060
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So, what you're saying is when it comes to online speech

1061
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
you don't understand restrictions.

1062
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I am saying I do not understand

1063
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
what is happening.

1064
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I do not understand...

1065
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
what is happening...

1066
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
with this whole thing.

1067
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
What is happening

1068
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
with this whole thing?

1069
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
With our culture, our country, our way of life?

1070
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
This is a question Herschel Greenbaum

1071
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
for better or worse, is determined to ask.

1072
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
What is happening?

1073
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
What is happening right now?

1074
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I really wish somebody would tell me

1075
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
what is happening.

1076
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Indeed.

1077
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Herschel, you have captivated the imagination,

1078
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
the hearts and minds of the entire world

1079
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
with your passion and your truth.

1080
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Buy my pickle. Buy my pickle. Buy my pickle.

1081
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
[host]  We will.

1082
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
[cheering and applause]

1083
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Okay, be that as it may

1084
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
your stance on gender roles is so regressive

1085
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
that it would effectively limit women to a life of servitude.

1086
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Exactly, servitude. Woman like to serve.

1087
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
She has little hands for serving things to people

1088
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
in very nice, graceful way.

1089
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Women have nipples to serve milk to people.

1090
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Woman have hole in lower body to produce babies.

1091
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
In other words, serve babies out of hole in body.

1092
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Yeah. Yeah!

1093
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Woman like serve! Yes!

1094
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Incredibly offensive.

1095
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
-Someone is menses. -No.

1096
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
[crowd laughing]

1097
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
That debate is certainly settled.

1098
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Let's throw it to the audience for questions.

1099
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You, sir.

1100
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Herschel, wow. It's amazing to talk to you.

1101
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
What an honor.

1102
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Honor to be here.

1103
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I was wondering how you felt about the taxes

1104
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
that are crushing small businesses.

1105
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I'm glad you ask.

1106
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You tax Herschel, Herschel will do

1107
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
violence to you.

1108
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yes, terrible violence!

1109
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
[all cheering]

1110
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Miss.

1111
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Herschel, have you considered running for office?

1112
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I would like office.

1113
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
[all cheering]

1114
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I would like big office.

1115
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I would like biggest office in America!

1116
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Huge office!

1117
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Oh, how about you? In the back.

1118
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yes, the shapely young woman in the back row. Cannot see.

1119
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
[man] Yes, thank you. Hello. Thank you.

1120
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I was wondering what your thoughts are

1121
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
on Christian prayer in public schools.

1122
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Yes, thank you.

1123
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Oh, simple question. Easy to answer.

1124
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I don't think I'm saying anything controversial

1125
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
when I say everybody know Jesus Christ mother

1126
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
was prostitute.

1127
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
-[all gasp] -And she invent story

1128
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
of Christianity

1129
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
to cover up fact that she prostitute.

1130
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So if you believe in Jesus,

1131
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
you are stupid idiot.

1132
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You suck, Herschel! I'm gonna get you!

1133
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
[siren wailing]

1134
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
[door opening]

1135
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
[female reporter] We interrupt your

1136
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
regularly scheduled program

1137
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
to bring you this special report.

1138
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Herschel Greenbaum the time-traveling immigrant

1139
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
who captured America's hearts and minds

1140
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
has fallen hard from grace.

1141
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
The public outcry against his bigotry

1142
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
is spreading throughout the country.

1143
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
He's been condemned by leaders on the left and right.

1144
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And that's not all.

1145
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Authorities are apparently calling for his deportation.

1146
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Due to an outdated filing system

1147
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
at the Ellis Island storage facility,

1148
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
his paperwork cannot be located.

1149
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Therefore, his citizenship has been revoked.

1150
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
If you have information about the whereabouts

1151
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
of the fugitive illegal alien Herschel Greenbaum,

1152
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
please call the tip hotline below.

1153
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
[host on TV]  I just feel bad for this guy at this point.

1154
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Look, I don't see how Herschel

1155
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
can come back from this one, folks.

1156
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Everyone has deserted him. He's alone in the world.

1157
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
His life is in ruins.

1158
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And the only person he has to blame for all of it,

1159
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm sorry,

1160
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
is Herschel Greenbaum.

1161
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
[glass breaking]

1162
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
The hell?

1163
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Dude.

1164
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Dude!

1165
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Stop!

1166
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Herschel, what the hell, man? What are you doing?

1167
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
These Christians, they try to kill me.

1168
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
They're not trying to kill you, Herschel.

1169
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
They just wanna send you back to Schlupsk.

1170
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Is worse! I never go back to Schlupsk.

1171
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Everything me and Sarah sacrificed

1172
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
to come here is for nothing.

1173
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Well, I don't know what to tell you, man.

1174
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I can't do anything for you.

1175
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
There is something.

1176
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You must smuggle Herschel away from American authorities.

1177
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
What?

1178
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I have accepted I have new fate.

1179
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I will move to Canada,

1180
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
become icicle man.

1181
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I will trade beaver for fire.

1182
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's not ideal. But this is what must happen.

1183
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'm terribly sorry this is happening to you

1184
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
and that everyone's turned on you

1185
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
because you've said truly despicable things.

1186
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
But I'm not gonna risk getting arrested again

1187
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
to help you.

1188
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Is not help.

1189
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Is trade.

1190
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
"Trade"?

1191
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I know you do not like Herschel.

1192
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I know you think your life better

1193
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
before Herschel.

1194
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You take me to Canada,

1195
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
you never have to see me again.

1196
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
All right.

1197
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Ten miles to Canada, no roads, no checkpoints.

1198
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Just walk from here.

1199
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
This will work.

1200
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
[mysterious music playing]

1201
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000

[groans]

1204
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Very good.

1205
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
[shivering]

1206
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
We stay warm together.

1207
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Thank you.

1208
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
[Ben] There's the border.

1209
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
We made it.

1210
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
[vehicle approaching]

1211
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Oh, shit. Someone's coming. Here.

1212
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Come on. Here, come on, come on.

1213
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
This way, this way.

1214
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
[officer] Stop. Stop!

1215
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
[grunts]

1216
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
[indistinct chatter]

1217
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Looks like they're just taking a break or something.

1218
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
So we'll just chill here till they're gone.

1219
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You do not mind?

1220
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
No, I don't mind.

1221
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
-Is there a lot of woods in Schlupsk?

1222
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
-Forest.

1223
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
-What's the difference? -Wolves.

1224
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh, wow.

1225
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Sarah loved to chase wolf.

1226
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
She would club them with stick,

1227
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
hit them with rock, kill them.

1228
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Very good time.

1229
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
She sounds pretty amazing.

1230
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I wish I could have met her.

1231
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Although, maybe it's for the best that I didn't.

1232
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Why you say this?

1233
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I'm probably not, like,

1234
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
the best-case scenario for what the family's become.

1235
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
She probably wouldn't be too psyched to,

1236
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
you know, to see who I am.

1237
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Not so sure.

1238
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Perhaps once I live in Canada,

1239
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
you come to visit Herschel.

1240
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You know, maybe--

1241
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
-Maybe you don't have to go to Canada.

1242
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
-What do you mean?

1243
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I mean, now that I think about it,

1244
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
you know, maybe we just haven't exhausted all of our options.

1245
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You don't have to go hide in Canada for the rest

1246
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
of your life.

1247
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
We'll fix this, and in the meantime,

1248
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
you can stay with me. We'll figure it out.

1249
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You do not want this.

1250
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
What do you mean?

1251
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You try to get rid of Herschel.

1252
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Take Herschel to middle of wilderness

1253
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
to take Herschel to Canada.

1254
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
You hate Herschel.

1255
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I'm just gonna tell you this, man.

1256
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I'm the one who called the Health Department on you.

1257
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I got you shut down. That was me.

1258
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And that's not all I did.

1259
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I told you to go on Twitter,

1260
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
knowing you would say despicable things.

1261
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
You always do.

1262
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And I did that to sabotage your business.

1263
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Is this it?

1264
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
No. After the Twitter thing didn't destroy you,

1265
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I attended the debate you were having.

1266
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I went to the back row and I disguised my voice

1267
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
and I asked the question about Christian prayer in school.

1268
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I knew exactly what you were gonna say.

1269
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I'm so sorry, Herschel.

1270
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
It was wrong. I shouldn't have done it.

1271
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I caused this whole thing to happen. Do you forgive me?

1272
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
[grunts]

1273
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
-Wait. -You are traitor

1274
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000

1308
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Herschel Greenbaum has been deemed

1309

a persona non grata on American soil.

His deportation trial got off to a strange start

1311
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
as his lawyer put forth a truly unexpected defense,

1312
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
that Herschel Greenbaum was not,

1313
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000

01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
What precedent are we setting here?

1321
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
That the defendant isn't actually the defendant?

1322
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Well, then, maybe Charles Manson

1323
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000

You not sell Boop Bops
