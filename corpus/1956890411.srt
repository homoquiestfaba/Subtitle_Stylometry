You still sick? Gonna throw up?

7
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:43,242
A little.

8
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,108
We're almost there, sweetie.

00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:47,609
What's the difference
between Memorial Day

10
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:49,108
and Veterinarians Day?

11
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,943
- You mean Veterans Day!
- Veteran.

12
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,809
- Veterans Day...
- Veterans Day.

13
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:56,042
...is when we celebrate all the
soldiers that fought for our country.

14
00:01:56,175 --> 00:02:03,042
Memorial Day is the day we remember all
the soldiers that died for our country.

15
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,776
Honey, your Daddy was a veteran.

16
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:06,209
He fought in the Gulf War.

17
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:08,542
There was a war over a gulf?

18
00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:10,209
It's a place!

19
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:11,909
I'm glad you didn't die.

20
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:15,042
- Me too, cutie.
- Me three!

21
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:17,108
Can we go fishing
when we get there, Dad?

22
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:18,476
Oh, honey, when we get there,

23
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:20,375
I'm gonna hang that sign
around my neck,

24
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:23,375
'cause you and me,
we are gone fishing, sweetheart.

25
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,642
Can you put the worms
on the hooks for me?

26
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:26,809
I hate the wormy part.

27
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,542
I got you covered!

28
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,876
- Are we ready?
- Oh, God.

29
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,476

Hey, yes, sir,
I got a reservation.

41
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:33,309
Should be under Paul,
Paul Michaelson.

42
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:34,943
How many?

43
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:37,242
Oh, just me, me and my wife.
My wife, Wendy.

44
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,042
Mommy, my game's dead,
do you have a charger?

45
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:41,843
Yeah, but just a sec, munch.

46
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:44,943
- And our daughter Taylor.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:47,509
- How old's the kid?
- Ten, and don't forget Lucky.

48
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:50,742
- Yeah, Lucky's our dog.
- You better keep Lucky on a damn leash,

49
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:53,442
- or he's gonna be unlucky.
- Right!

50
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:57,075
I'm gonna put you at site 10,
right in front of the lake.

51
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,509
- Stick this on your dash.
- Thank you.

52
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,175
- No loud music after 9.
- Thank you.

53
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,409
- Thank you.
- Stop by with a credit card.

54
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,943
- Okay.
- My store closes at 6.

55
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:09,175
Checkout time's 11 sharp,
or I'm gonna charge you another day.

56
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:12,042
You get a lot of people
out here on Thanksgiving?

57
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:13,776
Hell, we're rather busy as ever.

58
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,576
We got 12 sites and you're 40
miles from the nearest town.

59
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,409
You're smack dab in the middle
of Shitsville, USA.

60
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:23,042
You come here looking for a
party, you're in the wrong place.

61
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:26,275
- Thank you!
- Charming.

62
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:28,642
Come on, Lucky!

63
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,242
You good?

64
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:02,442
I guess so.

65
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:05,909
Hey, be sure to watch your head
on the slide out this time!

66
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:10,676
Yeah, the nine stitches I got last
time taught me that lesson, thank you!

67
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,242
And Taylor, be sure
to put your fishing boots on,

68
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,509
we don't need an RV
full of mud this time.

69
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:17,142
Okay, Mama!

70
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,442
Beautiful!

71
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:25,242
You want to go pay Grandpa
while I finish hooking up here?

72
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,375
Sure, make me do the dirty work?

73
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,909
Yeah. Hey.

74
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,042
I'm really glad
we're doing this.

75
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:35,108
You know?
It was nice to get away.

76
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:36,676
Some family time.

77
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:39,576
It's gonna be good for us.

78
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:41,676
Good for Taylor too.

79
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,676
- Hon.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:47,909
You just had your hands
on the sewage pipe.

81
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,542
Shit.

82
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,042
Literally.

83
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:55,709
Hey, Taylor,
put a jacket on, huh?

84
00:05:55,843 --> 00:06:00,142
And feed the dog
before we go to the lake, okay?

85
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,476
Tay!

86
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,209
Taylor!

87
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:10,209
Dad, you want me to feed Lucky
before we go to the lake?

88
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,509
That would be great!

Hello?

92
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,542
Gotta watch out for those.

93
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,108
Yeah.

94
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:08,442
Man.

95
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,108
Nice hat.

96
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:12,409
Gone fishing.

97
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,242
Going fishing.

98
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,275
Yeah, I figured that.

99
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:19,943
Yeah.

100
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,442
Uh, taking my daughter out.

101
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:23,609
Aw.

102
00:08:23,742 --> 00:08:25,342
So cute.

103
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:27,175
Quiet, Lucky!

104
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,075
She don't even really like fish.

105
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,075
I mean, she likes fish,
just-just not eating them.

106
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,742
Except fish sticks,
she'll eat those,

107
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:39,242
but, uh, we gotta tell her
they're chicken nuggets.

108
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,375
Oh, master of deception.

109
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:45,442
When I have kids,
I don't wanna ever lie.

110
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:50,175
There's no Santa Claus,
no Easter bunny, no tooth fairy.

111
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:53,075
I mean, why start off life
being lied to?

112
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:54,142
It's hard enough.

113
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,342
I don't know, it's...

114
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:59,609
I'm Miranda.

115
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:02,008
I'm Paul.

116
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,709
Been here long, Miranda?

117
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,809
Since yesterday.

118
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:10,742
Beautiful... here.

119
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:11,975
Lovely.

120
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,042
Lovely lake.

121
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,876
Yep, that's our bad boy
next door.

122
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,409
It's a rental.

123
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:24,342
Oh, nice, yeah, you staying
for Thanksgiving or...?

124
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:27,776
We might. It's so peaceful
and quiet here.

125
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,676
That's what I hear.

126
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,442
Well, if we catch anything,
you're welcome to come over for dinner.

127
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:35,175
Sure.

128
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,876
As long as my husband's invited.

129
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:39,309
Oh, my wife wouldn't have it
any other way.

130
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:42,442
Nice to meet you.

131
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:44,309
You too.

132
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,309
How was it?

133
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,943
Expensive, 68 bucks a night!

134
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:57,642
- They don't even have cable.
- Jesus.

135
00:09:57,776 --> 00:10:00,776
Remember when we used
to camp out with 15 bucks?

136
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,609
No. I don't.

137
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:03,909
Oh, yeah, worms are up too.

138
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,542
Jesus, expensive little fuckers.

139
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:08,609
And I thought the three of us
could make s'mores tonight.

140
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,709
I love you.

141
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,375
Aw, I love you s'mores.

142
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:17,342
Mrs. Corn-Corny corn Paul
came to town.

143
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:20,676
Oh, this is gonna be good.

144
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,609
Taylor is gonna love it here.

145
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:24,542
There's a swing set!

146
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:26,375
Yeah, look at that.

147
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:29,042
And look, there's even got
some motorboats out here.

148
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,242
Oh, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

149
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,876
You remember that dinner cruise
we took on that boat?

150
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:38,209
- Oh, God.
- You know, she projectile vomited all over that one.

151
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:41,809
Oh, God, I'd forgotten
all about that, Jesus Christ.

152
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:45,342
That woman's face! Oh!

153
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:48,008
Christ, that was like something
out of <i>The Exorcist.</i>

154
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:49,509
It was.

155
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:50,975
That woman's face.

156
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,742
Oh, shit.

157
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,576
- Hey, Lucky. No, no, no.
- Hey, Lucky!

158
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,042
- What the hell are you doing out?
- No, no, no, honey. You can't.

159
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,642
Honey, Taylor, you can't leave
Lucky outside, babe!

160
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,476
He's gotta be on the leash!

161
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:07,242
Sweets, that old man
is gonna get so mad!

162
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,909
Come on, kitten,
it's getting cold out here!

163
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:14,742
We're gonna go
if we're gonna go!

164
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:16,309
All right.

165
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,175
I am gonna make lunch
while you guys are out fishing.

166
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,843
How long do you think
you're gonna be?

167
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:22,909
I think we're gonna be
maybe an hour,

168
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,008
something like that.

169
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,075
- Yeah.
- You know.

170
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,242
Come on, Tay!

171
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:32,576
Taylor!

172
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,375
I hope she didn't get locked
in the bathroom again.

173
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:36,676
Hey, Taylor!

174
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,742
Taylor, honey!

175
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,676
- She's not in there.
- Huh?

176
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,476
- Paul.
- What?

177
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,008
She's not in there.

178
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:54,576
Wendy... she has to be.

179
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:55,909
Taylor!

180
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,242
She's not.

181
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,476
- Taylor!
- No, no, hey, hey, hey.

182
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:01,843
I'll find her.

183
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,676
Hey, Taylor!

184
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,975
Taylor!

185
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,609
What?

186
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:10,008
Hey!

187
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:13,943
- She's...
- Paul, she's not in there.

188
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:16,375
Did she come out when I went up
to the office?

189
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,709
I don't know.

190
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:21,142
I mean I was on the other side
of the RV, I...

191
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,042
- Taylor!
- I didn't hear her come out.

192
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,709
Taylor!

193
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,242
She's probably just hiding,
right?

194
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,576
- Oh, hiding, huh?
- She couldn't have gone far.

195
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,042
If she's hiding,
she's gonna be in big trouble.

196
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,709
Here, here, the outhouse.

197
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,609
Taylor!

198
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,409
Taylor!

199
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,042
Taylor!

200
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,876
Paul?

201
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,576
Where is she?

202
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:03,209
She's... She's gotta be...

203
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,642
here somewhere.

204
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:08,609
- Where could she go?
- Taylor!

205
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:12,042
- Check...
- Taylor!

206
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,709
She's gotta be close by.

207
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,742
Taylor!

208
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,542
Taylor!

209
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,342
Hey, Tay!

210
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:27,542
Taylor, come out!

211
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,442
Taylor!

212
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,876
Taylor!

213
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:46,642
- We got a little girl...
- They already filled me in before on the ride over.

214
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:49,175
Let's go the south
and west end of the lake.

215
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:51,509
They're ringing on the phone
for Franklin County,

216
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:53,209
- see if we get a helicopter.
- Done.

217
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:55,476
Any word on that runner?

218
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:58,175
Found his blood in the woods
a few miles from the prison.

219
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:01,008
- Suspect he's wounded.
- Good, slow him down.

220
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,275
All right, anything else?

221
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,075
FBI called about the convict.

222
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,542
Told him about the girl,
he asked if we needed help.

223
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:09,476
Yeah, well you tell him
I got it covered.

224
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:11,776
- Parents?
- Yep.

225
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:13,442
Not a word to them
about the prisoner

226
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,409
till we get any updates,
all right?

227
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:16,776
They already know.

228
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,709
Well, shit.

229
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,042
Mr. Michaelson, Mrs. Michaelson,

230
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,509
Sheriff Baker.

231
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:29,442
I'm gonna be running
the investigation.

232
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,876
Do you think the prisoner
had anything to do with this?

233
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:33,642
Well, I can see why
you'd be concerned,

234
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:36,476
but the last thing that a runner
that's been shot is gonna want

235
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,008
is to pick up a kid
and slow him down.

236
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:39,742
He was shot?

237
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,576
Yeah.

238
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,108
I promise, I'll always be as
transparent and as honest as I can be.

239
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:47,843
You got a partner here.

240
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,909
We'll get through this.

241
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,309
We'll find her, together.

242
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,542
Yeah.

243
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,576
Mind if I sit down?

244
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,742
Yeah, sure.

245
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:04,576
I know it's hard,
but if you can try to remember.

246
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,375
Now I know Mrs. Michaelson
was at the store,

247
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,209
and Mr. Michaelson, I heard
you were on the other side,

248
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:13,909
hooking up the RV,
is that right?

249
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,375
- Yeah.
- You remember hearing anything?

250
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:17,642
No.

251
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,309
A door maybe, footsteps?

252
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:20,909
- Nothing.
- A voice, cries?

253
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,476
I was on the other side
of the RV,

254
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:26,108
I'm hooking it up,
I get my fishing poles,

255
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:30,309
turn around,
I see another camper.

256
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:33,975
And that would be
Miss Miranda Hudson.

257
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,008
- I guess, yeah.
- She gave us a statement.

258
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:39,442
She said her and her husband are traveling
across country for a couple weeks.

259
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:42,075
Well, I didn't see him, I mean,

260
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,909
did he see anything?

261
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,642
He said he was in his RV
watching TV.

262
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:49,275
What about anybody else?
Did anybody else see anything?

263
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:51,843
We don't get many visits up here
in the winter.

264
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:54,776
It's a bit a ways,
as you can see.

265
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:59,008
Other than Mr. And Mrs. Hudson
and the owner, Tom Henry,

266
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:03,008
and groundskeeper
named Justin Knowles.

267
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,742
He was there.

268
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,209
He was right there, I seen him.

269
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:11,409
He drove by right here
on his Gator, thing.

270
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:15,075
He was, shit, it was just
right after the disappearance.

271
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:16,876
I mean, do...

272
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:19,175
Well, we questioned both,

273
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,175
and Tom says the last time he
saw was when you pulled in.

274
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,642
They could have lied.

275
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:26,909
We don't know them.

276
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,943
Look, there is no evidence
of foul play here.

277
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:32,709
All right.
That being said,

278
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:36,309
I've asked that no one leave
until we further investigate.

279
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:39,975
Now Mr. Henry and Mr. Knowles, they live
on the property, that's not a problem.

280
00:16:40,108 --> 00:16:46,175
But I have no legal right to
detain the Hudsons without cause.

281
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,909
No, of course not.

282
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:51,809
But they have offered to stay a while.
Help with your daughter.

283
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:54,975
The only advice I can give you
is stay as calm as you can.

284
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:57,642
Most of the time
these kids just wander away.

285
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:01,576
How long do you think she's gonna survive
in the woods having just wandered off?

286
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:04,542
We're bringing in a mobile unit.
We're gonna tape off all the area.

287
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:07,375
We're gonna have search teams
working all through the night.

288
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,476
Okay? I want you two to stay
here in case she comes back.

289
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,642
Why? Don't you think
we should be looking with you?

290
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,275
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

291
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,542
I told you I'll be honest
with you, and I will.

292
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:21,142
This runner,
he's armed and he's dangerous.

293
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,509
Now I don't think
he has your daughter, I don't.

294
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,175
I don't want you out in the
woods while he's running loose.

295
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:28,409
You stay here,
I'll have my men protect you.

296
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,909
Take this.

297
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,542
As soon as we get any update,

298
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:38,509
I'll have the team call you
and let you know right away.

299
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:43,008
If you need anything,
you call me.

300
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:45,175
Anytime.

301
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:54,242
Thirty-two years I've been
in this department come May,

302
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,975
and I've never lost a child.

303
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:58,676
Not one.

304
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:02,476
And I don't plan to.

305
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,108
We'll find her.

306
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:09,108
- Okay?
- Yeah.

307
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,876
Easy, easy, shh, shh.

308
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,409
It's okay.

309
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:44,776
We should be out there
searching too.

310
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:52,542
There is a team
of police out there, Wendy.

311
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,275
Just stop.

312
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:01,375
They're looking for her.

313
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,542
They'll find her.

314
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,175
Please.

315
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:33,576
Please, Paul.

316
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:42,142
We have to look for her.

317
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:49,042
What if
the convict has her?

318
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,442
We gotta sneak by the cops.

319
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:36,075
If they see us...

320
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:40,108
they'll stop us.

321
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:59,242
Taylor!

322
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,909
Taylor!

323
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:04,709
- Taylor!
- Taylor!

324
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:06,476
Taylor!

325
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,008
Taylor!

326
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,008
Taylor!

327
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:11,776
Taylor!

328
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:14,309
Taylor!

329
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:17,142
Taylor!

330
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,509
What is that?

331
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:24,242
It looks like a campfire.

332
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,442
That's him,
they said he'd been shot.

333
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:45,309
Wendy, stop,
we have to get the police.

334
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:47,609
No, he'll be gone by then.

335
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:49,409
We have to hold him here.

336
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,776
I'll grab the gun.

337
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,042
Wendy.

338
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:54,609
Wait, stop.

339
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:55,809
Wendy, stop.

340
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:02,375
Shh, shh.

341
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:31,709
Give me the gun.

342
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,042
Wendy, give me the...

343
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,509
Did you hear that?

344
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:44,175
<i>Sounds like it
came from the other side of the lake.</i>

345
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,709
<i>Get your men over there now.</i>

346
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:47,275
Let's move!

347
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,509
We have to tell them.

348
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,209
Tell them what?

349
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,742
- The truth.
- We can't do that.

350
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:01,042
We have to.

351
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:08,209
It was an accident.

352
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:10,242
Honey, you could tell them.

353
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,709
You could tell them a guy tried
to attack you

354
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:16,042
and, you know...

355
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:19,576
he's an escaped convict
for fuck's sake.

356
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,008
Eh, who's gonna miss him?

357
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:23,509
Did 'em a favor.

358
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,242
Paul.

359
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:30,375
We have to tell them the truth.

360
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,242
They'll take you away, Wendy.

361
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,542
I'm not gonna let
that happen, okay?

362
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:43,542
You understand that I would do
anything to keep that from happening.

363
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:48,309
I'm not gonna lose
both of you, okay?

364
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:53,409
We gotta stick together on this.

365
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,375
That's the only way
we're gonna get through this.

366
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:02,642
We have to tell them the truth.

367
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:08,209
Mr. And Mrs. Michaelson.

368
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:09,409
Hello?

369
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:26,975
It's the sheriff, hello?

370
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,075
Anybody home?

371
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,542
Yeah, hang on!

372
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,108
Hey, Sheriff, how you doing?

373
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,209
You wanna come on in?

374
00:25:56,342 --> 00:26:00,409
Wendy's just in the back
getting dressed, so.

375
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:01,809
Oh, yeah.

376
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:04,742
Yeah, it was a long night,
you know.

377
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:06,476
Yeah, how you doing?

378
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:07,642
You want some coffee?

379
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,943
Thanks, yeah.

380
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:11,242
Sugar if you have any.

381
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,476
I do.

382
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:19,476
I've yet to get to sleep myself.

383
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:20,809
Yeah.

384
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:26,609
Any news?

385
00:26:26,742 --> 00:26:29,576
Let's wait till your wife
comes out, and we can all talk.

386
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,509
Easier that way.

387
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:33,175
Okay.

388
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:41,075
What's that?

389
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:43,342
What's what?

390
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,676
- That coffee maker.
- Oh, this...

391
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,843
I was thinking about getting one
of those for my wife.

392
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,075
You know,
I don't know what that is.

393
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,542
Something my wife picked up,
you know.

394
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:56,876
I don't even know
where the hell she got it.

395
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:59,142
Um, I can add a little sugar.

396
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:02,242
I think I got
just enough left here.

397
00:27:04,008 --> 00:27:06,275
There we go.

398
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,275
Okay.

399
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:11,943
Here you go.

400
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:13,008
Shit!

401
00:27:13,142 --> 00:27:14,108
I'm so sorry!

402
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:16,876
- God, Jesus!
- All right.

403
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:19,309
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

404
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:26,008
Gosh, I'm just so jittery
this morning.

405
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:31,008
Rough night, man.

406
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:32,509
Just, you know.

407
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:38,008
Sheriff.

408
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:39,609
How you doing?

409
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:42,142
Why don't you sit down?

410
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:44,342
Let's all sit down for a minute.

411
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:01,542
Well, we found
the escaped inmate.

412
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:07,108
Sheriff.

413
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:09,342
Arrested him on a bus...

414
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,142
trying to cross state lines.

415
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,843
Questioned him,
and there's no indication that

416
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:21,642
he has anything to do with the
disappearance of your daughter.

417
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:25,108
- Oh, thank God.
- Hmm.

418
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,275
Yeah.

419
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,142
Good.

420
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:35,843
Both of you heard
that gunshot last night,

421
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,476
but we looked into it
this morning,

422
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:39,242
and on the south side
of the lake,

423
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,876
we found the body of a camper.

424
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:43,943
Been killed.

425
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:45,975
Wait, I don't understand.

426
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,943
You found a camper...

427
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:49,275
Survivor.

428
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:51,509
He was a survival weekend guys.

429
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,342
They come up here
from time to time,

430
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:57,108
to just spend the weekend trying
to survive off the land.

431
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:59,142
Sometimes a little longer.

432
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:01,909
Uh-huh.

433
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:07,075
So, do you think there's some
kind of connection between...

434
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,476
Right now, we're treating it
as two separate cases.

435
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:11,242
That's the best way
to go about it.

436
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,008
There's no indication
there is any connection.

437
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:17,476
Your daughter's out there,
we're gonna find her.

438
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:19,142
Sure.

439
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:21,476
Yeah, I mean, what else, yeah.

440
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:24,709
I'm gonna need you to come down
to the station.

441
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:27,709
Okay. Well, what for, why?

442
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:31,309
Well, we need to file a
official missing person report.

443
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:33,142
It's been over 24 hours now.

444
00:29:33,275 --> 00:29:36,142
Bring some pictures,
some videos.

445
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,676
Anything you think might help.

446
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:41,642
Sure.

447
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:43,309
We'll be there.

448
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,742
We'll be there.

449
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:53,476
...take a search party around
the other side of the lake.

450
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,742
What have I done?
What have I done?

451
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:59,442
What have I done?
I killed a man. I killed a man.

452
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:02,509
I killed... I killed an innocent man.
Oh, my God, I killed...

453
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:05,075
There's nothing we can do
about that, you hear me?

454
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:06,742
I killed an innocent man.

455
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:09,042
Taylor is missing.

456
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,843
We need to focus on that, okay?

457
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:16,375
Hey, hey,
it was an accident, okay?

458
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:25,476
I, uh... I'm real sorry to hear
about your daughter.

459
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:28,175
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

460
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:31,442
I'm Justin.
I take care of this place.

461
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:36,642
- Justin, I'm Paul.
- Paul.

462
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:38,509
This is my wife, Wendy.

463
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:42,542
You guys must be pretty bummed.

464
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:45,342
I mean, the cops asked me
if I saw anything weird

465
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,042
and I was just dumping trash
in the Gator, you know.

466
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:51,975
I didn't see nothing. It was just like...
It's like any other day, you know?

467
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:54,008
Thanks.

468
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:56,442
How old was she?

469
00:30:57,642 --> 00:30:59,209
Ten.

470
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:04,975
Why?

471
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,075
Why did you ask how old she was?

472
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:10,642
Why did you say "was"?

473
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:13,375
He said "How old was she?"
Is that what he just asked?

474
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:16,042
- How old was my daughter?
- No, no, I didn't mean that.

475
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,108
I was just thinking, um...

476
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:20,008
I don't know why I said that.

477
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:21,709
All right, thank you, Justin.

478
00:31:21,843 --> 00:31:24,242
Okay, anyway, if you guys
need anything or whatever,

479
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,375
I'm in my trailer at site four
just around there, all right.

480
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:30,409
Okay.

481
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:33,309
I heard about the dead camper,
that's pretty fucked.

482
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,409
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

483
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,142
What is going on?

484
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,409
What... What's happening?

485
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:02,676
Yeah, we come to fill out
a missing persons report, okay,

486
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:06,142
- but I feel like you guys are treating us like criminals here.
- Yeah, yeah.

487
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,776
Standard procedure I'm afraid.

488
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:09,042
I know it doesn't
feel very good.

489
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:11,108
Feel very good?
It's just...

490
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:12,676
isn't this wasting time?

491
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:15,375
- I mean, this time here...
- We're combing the lake.

492
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:17,642
There's a lot of land to cover.
We'll get it done.

493
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:20,876
- Tell us how this gets our daughter back?
- Yeah.

494
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:22,342
I wanna get her face out there.

495
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:24,609
The more eyes looking for her,
the better.

496
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:26,175
And better it come from you.

497
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:28,809
People tend to listen
a bit more that way.

498
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:31,042
What... What are you
talking about?

499
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,409
Press conference.

500
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,576
Jeffrey Michaelson,
that your father?

501
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:36,843
My brother.

502
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,242
All right.

503
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,075
Might wanna give
your family a call,

504
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:41,975
let 'em know what's going on.

505
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:44,075
Oh.

506
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:47,609
At this time,
we have no indications

507
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:49,409
that Taylor Michaelson
has been kidnapped

508
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,142
or that there is any foul play.

509
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:53,108
The homicide in the woods
is a separate case

510
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:55,075
until we find a connection
that says otherwise.

511
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:57,175
If you are part of a fire
or a police reserve

512
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:00,409
and would like to volunteer to join
the search, please contact my office.

513
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,209
The Michaelsons would like
to make a statement.

514
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:06,075
We pray to God
that our daughter, Taylor,

515
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,175
comes back to us unharmed.

516
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:10,309
<i>I would do anything
to get my daughter back.</i>

517
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:12,576
Ah, fuck! Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

518
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:27,509
Hey, Jeffrey, it's your brother.

519
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:30,709
Listen, Wendy and I are having
a little trouble with Taylor.

520
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:32,576
So...

521
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:38,309
So give me a call, okay.

522
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:40,008
Please.

523
00:35:06,342 --> 00:35:07,509
Shh.

524
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:09,642
Lucky!

525
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,275
- Lucky, hey, Lucky!
- Hey!

526
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,809
Hi, sorry.

527
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:15,242
I hope we're not interrupting.

528
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:16,943
We thought maybe you guys
might be hungry,

529
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,042
so we brought you some dinner.

530
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:20,909
- Wow.
- I'm Eric.

531
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:23,509
- Hi.
- You've already met my wife, Miranda.

532
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:26,576
Yep. Yep.

533
00:35:27,476 --> 00:35:29,309
Thanks. Wendy.
I'm Wendy. Hi.

534
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:31,309
It's the least we could do.

535
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:33,642
Feel free to join us
if you want.

536
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:35,142
Oh, no, thank you.

537
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:37,342
We don't wanna intrude.

538
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:40,676
Plus, the police told us that
we could help search tonight.

539
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,042
Eric is a reserve fireman...

540
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:43,442
Part-time.

541
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:45,342
I'm a musician.

542
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,609
Hey, hey, quiet!
I'm sorry about that.

543
00:35:47,742 --> 00:35:50,776
That's all right. I'm not really
a big dog person. They can tell.

544
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:55,142
Look, we can only
imagine how hard this must be.

545
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:58,309
So if there's anything
that you need, we'd...

546
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:01,843
Thanks, guys, thank you.

547
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:04,442
We really...
We really appreciate it.

548
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:07,242
- Just let us know.
- Sure. Thanks for the help.

549
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,375
Uh-huh.

550
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,609
What's going on, Wendy?

551
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,709
Our daughter is missing,

552
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:24,209
and you're inviting
Miss Congeniality to dinner!

553
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:26,943
Hey, hey, what the hell
are you talking about, Wendy?

554
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:28,776
I'm trying to be a nice guy.

555
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:30,609
- Nice?
- Yeah.

556
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:33,442
Nice?

557
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:36,342
You don't think I saw the way
that you looked at her? Huh?

558
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:39,108
You don't think that maybe
if you didn't get distracted

559
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,409
- our daughter wouldn't still...
- Okay, stop, stop!

560
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,075
- ...be in this trailer?
- Stop, stop!

561
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:44,709
Okay, I know what this is about.

562
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:46,943
All right, don't blame me.

563
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:50,476
Do you think that's gonna bring
her back? Hmm?

564
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:55,542
It was a long time ago, Wendy.

565
00:36:55,676 --> 00:36:58,075
I told you
that would never happen again,

566
00:36:58,209 --> 00:36:59,642
and that's what I meant.

567
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:06,342
Okay, I fucked up!
But don't keep beating me up about it!

568
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,175
Taylor's the only reason
I'm with you!

569
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,075
- Knock it off!
- Taylor's the only reason

570
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:11,776
- I'm with you!
- Stop it!

571
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:13,375
- We don't have anything, Paul!
- Shh!

572
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:15,042
We don't have anything, Paul!

573
00:37:15,175 --> 00:37:16,943
We don't have anything
without Taylor!

574
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:19,509
What do we have, Paul?
What do we have?

575
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:22,442
Tell me, what do we have
without our daughter?

576
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,108
We have each other.

577
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,876
Hey, hey, hey.

578
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:29,809
We have each other.

579
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,175
That's all we have,

580
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:34,742
and we're gonna
get through this.

581
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,542
Together.

582
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:44,242
- You and me.
- We'll get through it.

583
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,175
- You and me.
- We're all right.

584
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:48,375
Are you getting anywhere on that
little girl's disappearance?

585
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:57,375
You can't take it home
with you, John.

586
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:02,209
It's not fair to me.

587
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:21,008
<i>There's some
thunder and lightning outside,</i>

588
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,309
<i>and I miss you! Mwah!</i>

589
00:39:23,442 --> 00:39:26,609
<i>And I have three friends that...</i>

590
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:32,075
<i>three friends that are Korean,</i>

591
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:35,008
<i>that one of them knows Korean.</i>

592
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:37,375
<i>It's... Happy birthday,
and they went up</i>

593
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:41,576
<i>in front of the whole class
and sang it to everybody.</i>

594
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:42,876
<i>This is how you sing it.</i>

595
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,409
We gotta get some sleep.
Come on.

596
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:47,442
You haven't slept in two days.

597
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:49,042
Oh, I know.

598
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:52,209
- Come to bed with me.
- No, I can't.

599
00:39:52,342 --> 00:39:54,975
I mean, I want to, but I can't.

600
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:57,876
I've already taken two Ambien.

601
00:39:58,008 --> 00:40:04,375
My body's so tired,
but I cannot stop my mind from racing.

602
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:09,175
Eric... Eric told the police

603
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:13,642
that he was watching TV.
There's no cable here.

604
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:15,409
Eric.

605
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:18,576
And Lucky... Lucky was looking
at them. Lucky was barking.

606
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,776
Lucky never barks
at anybody like that.

607
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:22,509
Why was he barking
at him like that?

608
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:25,175
- Okay.
- Why?

609
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:26,576
Why?

610
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,843
Why?

611
00:40:28,975 --> 00:40:30,375
Why do dogs do anything?

612
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:31,709
Where you going?

613
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:34,242
Going to bed?

614
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,975
I'm gonna call the sheriff.

615
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:37,642
What?

616
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:38,742
Give me that!

617
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:40,108
- What? Give it to me.
- Hey!

618
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:42,576
- What are you doing?
- To tell him what? Ow!

619
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:44,809
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, but what are you gonna tell him?

620
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,476
- I was gonna tell him that the guy was lying!
- Our dog barked?

621
00:40:54,776 --> 00:40:58,975
You know what, they said that they were
gonna go help with the search party, right?

622
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:01,209
So maybe we should just...

623
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:03,975
go look around.

624
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:05,776
- Give me that.
- What?

625
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:06,975
That's crazy. Come on.

626
00:41:07,108 --> 00:41:08,709
You and me are going to bed.

627
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,409
That's what we're gonna do.

628
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,975
Now come on.

629
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:16,008
- What if she's over there?
- Huh?

630
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:19,943
What if Taylor is over there
tied up?

631
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:24,375
Fifty feet away.

632
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:32,209
Paul.

633
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,242
Don't slam it.

634
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:56,008
I'll check the back.

635
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,275
Damn it.

636
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:34,742
Hey, did you check?

637
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:36,209
Yeah.

638
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:37,709
Sorry.

639
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:01,309
Paul.

640
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:05,943
Yeah.

641
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:08,776
Prenatal drugs.
That's clomiphene.

642
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:11,809
IVF injectors,
prenatal vitamins.

643
00:43:11,943 --> 00:43:14,209
They were trying to have a baby.

644
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,042
Okay.

645
00:43:16,175 --> 00:43:18,342
What if they were trying
to have a baby so badly

646
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:21,309
that they took ours instead?

647
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:24,175
Or maybe they're just
trying to have a baby.

648
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:26,709
- Come on.
- She said that they were newlyweds.

649
00:43:26,843 --> 00:43:28,142
What?

650
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,509
They're newlyweds.

651
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:34,142
What if Miranda
was distracting you

652
00:43:34,275 --> 00:43:38,509
so that her husband
could take our daughter?

653
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:45,542
Okay, so,
what'd they do with her?

654
00:43:47,843 --> 00:43:50,476
The compartments down below.

655
00:43:56,943 --> 00:43:58,209
Nothing there.

656
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:05,909
Look at this one here.

657
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,776
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hurry up.

658
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:11,175
Oh... locked.

659
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:13,142
- Hi.
- Jesus...

660
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,676
Christ,
you guys scared us.

661
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:17,776
Man, we were just coming back

662
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:19,876
to see if you guys
were back yet.

663
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:21,108
- We were wondering...
- Yeah.

664
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,509
if anybody found anything.

665
00:44:23,642 --> 00:44:25,442
Anybody find anything?

666
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:27,609
No. Uh...

667
00:44:27,742 --> 00:44:29,442
They're still out there.

668
00:44:29,576 --> 00:44:32,075
We just came back
'cause she wasn't feeling well.

669
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:35,576
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep
last night.

670
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:37,242
Me neither.

671
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:42,342
Yeah, I'm sure we could all
use a little sleep.

672
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:47,008
So, you know, it's just been
one of those days.

673
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,975
So let's go.

674
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:51,409
Good night. Come on, honey.

675
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:54,676
But, you know, hey, you guys.

676
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:57,843
You know, Paul and I were thinking
of sneaking one of the fishing boats

677
00:44:57,975 --> 00:45:02,075
out in the morning to search the
lake, but they won't let us search,

678
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:05,375
but they'd let you,
so maybe if we go together?

679
00:45:06,275 --> 00:45:10,175
- Uh, I...
- Yeah, absolutely.

680
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:13,742
We'll meet you guys
at the dock at 7 a.m.

681
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:18,008
Okay, thank you.
Wow.

682
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:20,275
- Thanks.
- Good night.

683
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:21,709
Come on.

684
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:41,175
Shh, Lucky!

685
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,642
Shh!

686
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:56,709
Shh, shh.

687
00:45:58,409 --> 00:45:59,642
Baby!

688
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:02,876
Shh, hey!

689
00:46:03,008 --> 00:46:04,442
Shut up.

690
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,975
Hey, shh, shh.

691
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:23,609
Right there, right there.

692
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,476
What are you doing?

693
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:30,709
Are you serious right now?

694
00:47:30,843 --> 00:47:31,975
- Hey.
- Knock it off.

695
00:47:32,108 --> 00:47:33,375
Hey, hey, hey.

696
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:36,209
Oh, please, Paul.

697
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,108
Wendy.

698
00:47:39,242 --> 00:47:40,642
Would you knock it off?

699
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:47,209
You're completely nuts.

700
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:51,309
- I said, stop.
- Shut up, honey.

701
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:54,042
Get off me.

702
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,542
Oh, my God. Just get off me.

703
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,476
Don't do that.

704
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:03,476
Don't do that.

705
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:10,642
Where'd you go?

706
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,742
Listen, about last night,
I wanted to tell you...

707
00:48:35,876 --> 00:48:38,242
I don't wanna talk about that.

708
00:48:40,175 --> 00:48:42,042
Fine. Uh...

709
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:44,008
You wanna tell me what
we're doing here?

710
00:48:44,142 --> 00:48:45,709
I thought you didn't even like
these people,

711
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:48,142
then you wanna invite 'em out
for an afternoon on the lake.

712
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:51,442
We are getting them alone, gonna get information,
and then we're gonna go to the police.

713
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:53,676
We can go to the police now
and tell them what we found.

714
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:56,275
That's a good idea. After we tell
them that we broke into their RV

715
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:58,242
and searched through
all their belongings,

716
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,876
maybe we can tell them
that I killed a camper too!

717
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:03,943
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

718
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:07,175
Thanks for doing this, guys.
We appreciate it.

719
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:10,142
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no worries.

720
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:15,542
Okay.
All right.

721
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,576
Okay.

722
00:49:27,008 --> 00:49:29,008
All right.

723
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:31,409
Get us off the dock here.

724
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,642
Okay.

725
00:49:34,576 --> 00:49:36,309
We're good.

726
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:35,909
Maybe we should head back now.

727
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:37,742
I think we're almost out of gas.

728
00:50:39,576 --> 00:50:40,876
Hey, wait.

729
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:43,975
There's something... There's
something floating over there.

730
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:47,642
Right on the edge of the lake,
look. See?

731
00:50:47,776 --> 00:50:49,442
Oh, yeah, no, I see it.

732
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:53,008
I mean, it's something...
Something's floating over there.

733
00:50:59,843 --> 00:51:00,943
What is it?

734
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:02,676
It looks like
a plastic trash bag.

735
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,576
- No.
- Come on, guys. We've been out here six hours,

736
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:08,509
getting dehydrated. We should head
back, get some food, refuel.

737
00:51:08,642 --> 00:51:10,342
It's just a bag.

738
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:15,442
We can take a quick look,
all right.

739
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:18,609
Come on. Come on.

740
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:22,108
Okay, okay, okay.

741
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:55,042
Let me see it.

742
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:01,209
Go back now?

743
00:52:01,342 --> 00:52:03,542
You wanna open it or...?

744
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:07,843
- You didn't even wanna look.
- Huh?

745
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:09,843
He didn't wanna look.

746
00:52:09,975 --> 00:52:11,709
How... How are you so sure?

747
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:14,909
Well, I wasn't.

748
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:17,075
But it looked
like a plastic bag,

749
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:20,476
and it was, so I guess
I was right about that.

750
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:23,876
Damn it!

751
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:25,409
We're out of gas.

752
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,142
I was right
about that too. Shit!

753
00:52:27,275 --> 00:52:29,476
Maybe you didn't wanna look

754
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:33,576
because you were sure
that it wasn't her.

755
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:34,943
What?

756
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:36,375
Wendy.

757
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:38,642
I don't mind asking them
a few questions, okay,

758
00:52:38,776 --> 00:52:40,909
but let's not just start
accusing people...

759
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:42,742
Wait, wait, wait, questions?

760
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:44,075
What questions?

761
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:46,975
For example,
how is the honeymoon going?

762
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:49,476
Huh?

763
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:53,042
Look, guys, I don't know
what you're talking about,

764
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:54,442
but we're stranded out here.

765
00:52:54,576 --> 00:52:56,975
It's gonna take a long time
to row back.

766
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:59,108
I think what my wife
is trying to say

767
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,542
is that we just find it
a little ironic

768
00:53:01,676 --> 00:53:04,042
that you guys are trying
to have a kid

769
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:07,476
and our kid goes missing.

770
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:08,975
How do you know that?

771
00:53:09,609 --> 00:53:10,876
We found the IVF.

772
00:53:11,008 --> 00:53:12,709
If you have her,
just give her back to us.

773
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:15,375
- You go through our shit?
- We won't say anything, I promise we won't.

774
00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:17,476
We're out here trying to help
and they're fucking accusing us!

775
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:20,342
Calm down, Eric.
They're obviously going through a lot.

776
00:53:20,476 --> 00:53:23,409
You know, and just think, like,
you guys are newlyweds,

777
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:25,876
but you've been trying
to have a kid for years.

778
00:53:26,008 --> 00:53:27,709
It just looks a little,
you know.

779
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:29,609
Don't even answer that question!

780
00:53:29,742 --> 00:53:32,042
I'm gonna row us back myself,

781
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,175
when we get back we're getting
the hell out of here.

782
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:37,042
Fuck these people!
Get out of my way. Fuck you!

783
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:40,742
I am so sorry.

784
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:43,709
- You're not going anywhere.
- Jesus, fuck!

785
00:53:43,843 --> 00:53:45,642
- What?
- No, honey, I'm sorry.

786
00:53:45,776 --> 00:53:47,876
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna answer a couple of questions.

787
00:53:48,008 --> 00:53:50,476
You better get your wife in
check before someone gets hurt.

788
00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:53,075
Wendy, put the gun down.
She's not normally like this.

789
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:54,809
- She's not a violent person.
- I feel it in my body.

790
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:57,309
I feel it. I know you can feel it.
They have her.

791
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,108
What are you talking about?

792
00:53:59,242 --> 00:54:00,909
We never said we were newlyweds.

793
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:02,542
We've been married
for five years.

794
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:04,776
We spent all of our money
trying to have a kid

795
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,342
so we decided to take this trip,

796
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,776
just focus on us,
and forget about having kids.

797
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:12,375
Until you found our daughter

798
00:54:12,509 --> 00:54:14,542
and you thought
that you could have

799
00:54:14,676 --> 00:54:15,943
- one of your own.
- No!

800
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:18,642
We would never do
something like that.

801
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:20,008
You are lying.

802
00:54:20,142 --> 00:54:22,943
- This game is over, we're done!
- Paul!

803
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:24,876
You protecting
your little girlfriend?

804
00:54:25,008 --> 00:54:26,409
What are you talking about?

805
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:28,175
You thought I was sleeping?

806
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:31,008
I watched you.
I watched you watch her.

807
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,075
Oh, you're good.

808
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:35,843
You like being watched, a lot.

809
00:54:35,975 --> 00:54:38,709
Maybe it's because my husband
could get me pregnant

810
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:39,975
and hers can't.

811
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:41,375
That's enough!

812
00:55:08,909 --> 00:55:10,209
Jesus!

813
00:55:10,342 --> 00:55:12,209
Wendy!

814
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,509
Hey!

815
00:55:17,642 --> 00:55:19,275
Hey! Hey!

816
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:21,943
Wendy! Wendy!

817
00:55:22,075 --> 00:55:23,442
God!

818
00:55:23,576 --> 00:55:24,442
You okay?

819
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:25,709
Hang on to the boat!

820
00:55:25,843 --> 00:55:28,142
Oh, God, you're okay.

821
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:30,342
Are you okay? Are you okay?

822
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:32,142
Oh, God.

823
00:55:34,642 --> 00:55:36,642
- Where's Miranda?
- I don't know.

824
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:39,742
I don't know.

825
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:51,943
Okay, let's go, let's go.

826
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:54,309
Let's go right now.

827
00:56:14,642 --> 00:56:15,609
Got a minute?

828
00:56:15,742 --> 00:56:17,442
Yep.

829
00:56:17,576 --> 00:56:18,609
What is it?

830
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:20,409
FBI called again.

831
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:22,776
Not their territory.
This ain't connected yet.

832
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:25,742
What if it's connected
to the dead camper in the woods?

833
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:28,309
- No proof of that.
- Look, John...

834
00:56:28,442 --> 00:56:30,108
this isn't looking good,
all right.

835
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:33,275
I'm just saying,
maybe we can use some help.

836
00:56:34,342 --> 00:56:37,409
Who you working for? Huh?

837
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:48,209
Rakes, get Tim Bradley
on the phone,

838
00:56:48,342 --> 00:56:51,242
tell him the situation,
get him down here.

839
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:05,209
Anything you wanna tell me?

840
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:11,342
Any detail come back in?

841
00:57:17,209 --> 00:57:19,242
Every piece
of information matters.

842
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:20,609
Sheriff...

843
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:25,375
we feel so helpless.

844
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:31,175
Well, there's someone
I'd like you to talk to.

845
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:33,375
I think he might be able
to help you.

846
00:57:35,075 --> 00:57:37,108
His name is Dr. Bradley.

847
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:39,742
He's a grief counselor.

848
00:57:42,175 --> 00:57:44,509
We have nothing to grieve.

849
00:57:46,342 --> 00:57:49,442
Taylor is still out there.

850
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:52,309
You said you would find her.

851
00:57:52,442 --> 00:57:57,409
You said
that you would find her.

852
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,542
You need to come see this.

853
01:01:21,108 --> 01:01:23,409
This mean anything to you?

854
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,676
It's...

855
01:01:30,476 --> 01:01:31,342
it's Taylor's.

856
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:33,542
It's Taylor's
favorite necklace.

857
01:01:33,676 --> 01:01:35,108
Where did you find it?

858
01:01:35,843 --> 01:01:37,075
Hudson's RV.

859
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:40,809
Eric Hudson's been stabbed
multiple times.

860
01:01:40,943 --> 01:01:44,909
So at this point, high probability
your daughter's been abducted.

861
01:01:45,042 --> 01:01:48,075
We got an APB out
for his wife, Miranda.

862
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:51,375
We'll get some answers.

863
01:01:58,676 --> 01:02:00,309
I had lied to you.

864
01:02:01,576 --> 01:02:04,142
I told you
I'd never lost a child.

865
01:02:04,943 --> 01:02:06,409
I lost one.

866
01:02:07,476 --> 01:02:09,008
My son.

867
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,975
A few years back.

868
01:02:11,742 --> 01:02:13,008
Drug addiction.

869
01:02:14,509 --> 01:02:18,142
And it's a pain that no one
should ever go through.

870
01:02:19,476 --> 01:02:22,609
And the reason I can make sure
you don't have to.

871
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:25,142
My word.

872
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:30,576
Oh, my...

873
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:34,943
What are we gonna tell him?
We gotta tell him something!

874
01:02:35,075 --> 01:02:37,242
They're wasting time looking
for Miranda.

875
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:38,375
Yeah.

876
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:41,242
They are not gonna find her.
She's dead.

877
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,108
- Shh!
- How are they gonna find her?

878
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:44,709
We don't know that for sure.

879
01:02:44,843 --> 01:02:47,843
Well, Eric's dead.

880
01:02:47,975 --> 01:02:49,576
Eric's dead.

881
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:51,676
We are murderers.

882
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,008
No, no, that was an accident.

883
01:02:54,142 --> 01:02:57,943
- No, once is an accident, twice?
- God damn it.

884
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,943
What do you want me
to do, Wendy?

885
01:03:00,075 --> 01:03:04,075
- I don't know.
- Fuck, for all we know, they did do it! Right?

886
01:03:04,209 --> 01:03:06,542
- If they did it, where is she?
- I don't know!

887
01:03:06,676 --> 01:03:09,175
- Maybe they took her somewhere!
- Where is Taylor?

888
01:03:09,309 --> 01:03:11,709
Maybe they had an accomplice.
They hid her, okay.

889
01:03:11,843 --> 01:03:14,108
Or they gave her to somebody.

890
01:03:15,776 --> 01:03:18,509
We can't ask them now.

891
01:03:18,642 --> 01:03:21,975
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

892
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:26,642
Jesus.

893
01:03:38,609 --> 01:03:40,342
Shut up.

894
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:55,008
I saw you talking
to the sheriff.

895
01:03:56,108 --> 01:03:57,975
- So?
- So?

896
01:03:58,108 --> 01:04:00,209
Don't play games with me.

897
01:04:00,342 --> 01:04:02,576
I didn't say anything,
all right?

898
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:09,042
- I'm scared, Tom.
- What are you scared of?

899
01:04:09,175 --> 01:04:11,008
Dead bodies keep popping up
all over.

900
01:04:11,142 --> 01:04:14,442
I don't like this, Tom,
and I need some answers.

901
01:04:14,576 --> 01:04:15,975
Like what?

902
01:04:16,108 --> 01:04:18,142
Did you kill those people?

903
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:20,175
I've known you
since you were 14,

904
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:23,509
took you in
when no one else wanted you,

905
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:25,442
hired you, fed you...

906
01:04:25,576 --> 01:04:27,776
treated you like a son,
you're gonna ask me that?

907
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:31,509
That's what I'm asking you,
Tom, 'cause I know you.

908
01:04:31,642 --> 01:04:32,975
I know all about you.

909
01:04:33,108 --> 01:04:34,476
I know everything.

910
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:36,843
I didn't kill those people.

911
01:04:36,975 --> 01:04:39,275
Well, did you take
that little girl?

912
01:04:41,142 --> 01:04:43,742
Don't you ever insult me
like that again!

913
01:04:43,876 --> 01:04:45,275
You understand me?

914
01:04:46,108 --> 01:04:47,375
You understand me?

915
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,375
Yeah, yeah.

916
01:04:50,642 --> 01:04:51,709
Here.

917
01:04:54,108 --> 01:04:56,075
Now get.

918
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:01,175
Just don't drag me into
any of your shit!

919
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:03,209
You're welcome!

920
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:35,909
Taylor!

921
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:39,476
Taylor!

922
01:05:41,876 --> 01:05:43,075
Taylor!

923
01:05:51,676 --> 01:05:53,108
Dinner's getting cold.

924
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,876
How can you eat right now?

925
01:05:56,008 --> 01:05:59,742
Wendy, I haven't eaten
in three days, okay.

926
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:03,209
I haven't slept in three days.

927
01:06:03,342 --> 01:06:07,943
And even if we do get Taylor
back, guess what?

928
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:10,843
When the police find out
what we did,

929
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:14,042
we're all going to jail, okay?

930
01:06:15,108 --> 01:06:20,242
So this, right now,
is all we've got.

931
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:26,975
And I'm not gonna sit
around wasting it by worrying.

932
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,242
All right?

933
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:31,576
So please, come sit down.

934
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:36,175
Why don't we just try to have a
semblance of a nice, normal night?

935
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:44,042
You wanna watch a movie
after dinner?

936
01:06:56,909 --> 01:06:58,509
Ah.

937
01:07:22,409 --> 01:07:23,476
Hello?

938
01:07:38,509 --> 01:07:40,409
Hello?

939
01:08:18,776 --> 01:08:20,108
Hello?

940
01:08:33,975 --> 01:08:35,909
Oh! Okay.

941
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:37,375
- We're closed.
- Yeah, I...

942
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,375
Sorry.

943
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:44,642
You scared me.

944
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:52,042
Uh, I was...

945
01:08:52,175 --> 01:08:54,108
I had some...

946
01:08:54,242 --> 01:08:57,042
I'm sorry,
I already opened the chocolate.

947
01:09:01,476 --> 01:09:05,142
Be a dollar for the candy bar
plus the videos.

948
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:09,008
- I don't have a wallet.
- Of course.

949
01:09:10,943 --> 01:09:14,809
Write down what you take, time in and
time out, and I'll put it on your bill.

950
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:16,609
So generous.

951
01:09:16,742 --> 01:09:18,075
Considering the circumstances.

952
01:09:18,209 --> 01:09:19,876
Fine, if it'll make
you feel better,

953
01:09:20,008 --> 01:09:21,542
I won't charge you
for the candy bar,

954
01:09:21,676 --> 01:09:24,075
but make sure
you bring those back.

955
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:27,509
Will do.

956
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:31,609
Hey!

957
01:09:32,442 --> 01:09:34,642
Sorry about your daughter.

958
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,476
I rented out some movies.

959
01:10:14,609 --> 01:10:15,975
Well, that's great.

960
01:10:16,108 --> 01:10:18,943
So we can have a nice,
normal night of camping.

961
01:10:19,075 --> 01:10:21,008
Yeah, oh, what about this one?

962
01:10:21,142 --> 01:10:22,876
It's one of Taylor's favorites.

963
01:10:23,008 --> 01:10:26,409
It's where a daddy fish
loses a baby fish.

964
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:30,742
Or, oh, yeah,
I got an action movie about abduction.

965
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:33,509
Or... Oh, what about this one?

966
01:10:33,642 --> 01:10:35,642
This one flew
over the cuckoo's nest.

967
01:10:35,776 --> 01:10:38,409
That's one you can relate to,
isn't it, Paul?

968
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:41,809
Or maybe we could go out
to the campfire

969
01:10:41,943 --> 01:10:48,442
and finally make those s'mores
you were talking about!

970
01:10:48,576 --> 01:10:50,042
Enough!

971
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:58,576
Nice dinner.

972
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,442
Paul!

973
01:11:24,742 --> 01:11:25,876
Shut up.

974
01:11:26,008 --> 01:11:27,776
Let's have that glass
of wine, Paul!

975
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,642
Fuck off!

976
01:11:31,175 --> 01:11:32,476
It's pretty good.

977
01:11:32,609 --> 01:11:34,576
Shut up, shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up,

978
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:35,742
Paul!

979
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:43,008
Lucky.

980
01:11:44,242 --> 01:11:45,876
Lucky, quiet.

981
01:11:47,576 --> 01:11:49,275
What, what, what?

982
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:53,342
What are you barking for?

983
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,309
Come here.

984
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:02,175
Yeah?

985
01:12:02,309 --> 01:12:04,776
- I'm sorry to bother you...
- Don't.

986
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:08,843
Um, it's a beautiful night.

987
01:12:14,442 --> 01:12:18,042
- How are you doing today?
- Peachy.

988
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:21,142
Sorry, I'm not too good
at talking to people.

989
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:23,409
I seem to say the wrong things.

990
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:28,409
I just wanted to say I really
hope you guys find your daughter.

991
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:30,776
You know, alive.

992
01:12:30,909 --> 01:12:32,843
Okay.

993
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:36,075
This is for you.

994
01:12:41,242 --> 01:12:44,442
Okay, thanks.

995
01:12:45,275 --> 01:12:47,309
Have a good night.

996
01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:13,142
Shit!

997
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:18,409
Taylor, Taylor, honey!

998
01:16:18,542 --> 01:16:19,709
Hey!

999
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:21,042
Hey, I found her!

1000
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:24,042
Hey, over here!

1001
01:16:24,943 --> 01:16:26,175
Help!

1002
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:28,409
Come back to me, please!

1003
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,742
Please, honey, please,
come back to me!

1004
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:31,843
Taylor!

1005
01:16:31,975 --> 01:16:33,042
Honey, come back to me!

1006
01:16:43,576 --> 01:16:45,342
Get inside.

1007
01:16:51,342 --> 01:16:54,542
Looks like someone screwed the pooch.

1008
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:57,542
Make sure you get a good shot
of those cuts right there.

1009
01:16:57,676 --> 01:17:01,642
I wanna know, what the hell
is going on here, okay?

1010
01:17:01,776 --> 01:17:04,075
Our daughter is still missing.

1011
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:06,342
You got some dead guy
in the woods over there.

1012
01:17:06,476 --> 01:17:08,375
These guys are either dead
or missing,

1013
01:17:08,509 --> 01:17:12,242
so please, tell me where the
hell everybody was this morning?

1014
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:14,776
It's Thanksgiving day.

1015
01:17:14,909 --> 01:17:16,709
I pulled these men
from their tables.

1016
01:17:16,843 --> 01:17:20,642
Everyone else we got is out in the
woods looking for your daughter.

1017
01:17:21,909 --> 01:17:24,509
I forgot about that, Jesus.

1018
01:17:24,642 --> 01:17:26,342
How's your wife?

1019
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:28,309
How the hell do you think
she is, man?

1020
01:17:28,442 --> 01:17:30,709
Somebody murdered our dog!

1021
01:17:30,843 --> 01:17:32,075
You don't know that.

1022
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:33,476
It could be an animal.

1023
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:35,242
An animal?

1024
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:38,975
Listen, last night,
my wife said she saw

1025
01:17:39,108 --> 01:17:41,175
that creepy kid Justin
doing drugs.

1026
01:17:41,309 --> 01:17:45,108
And this morning, I hear him, he's buzzing
all over the campground on his Gator.

1027
01:17:45,242 --> 01:17:49,709
- Drugs, where?
- Doing drugs in that van back there that he lives in, okay.

1028
01:17:49,843 --> 01:17:53,476
He comes to my wife last night, and he
hands her a chocolate bar, all right.

1029
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:55,576
Acting strange,
stranger than usual.

1030
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:58,242
So, you know, she follows him.
She sees him.

1031
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:00,342
He's smoking something
out of a glass pipe.

1032
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,676
We'll bring him in,
and we'll talk to him.

1033
01:18:02,809 --> 01:18:05,876
I think it's time for you and Mrs.
Michaelson, maybe you go to a hotel.

1034
01:18:06,008 --> 01:18:09,275
A hotel? We're not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere

1035
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:14,242
until my daughter is back here
with me safely!

1036
01:18:23,975 --> 01:18:24,975
Bag it up.

1037
01:18:25,108 --> 01:18:26,375
You got it.

1038
01:18:27,876 --> 01:18:31,476
Forensics found a hair
under Eric Hudson's ring.

1039
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,642
Well, their records are clean.

1040
01:18:35,843 --> 01:18:37,676
Find the wife.

1041
01:18:37,809 --> 01:18:39,375
FBI called again!

1042
01:18:39,509 --> 01:18:40,542
Not now!

1043
01:18:42,209 --> 01:18:44,876
Wendy, open the door.

1044
01:18:47,809 --> 01:18:50,142
Hey, Wendy!

1045
01:18:52,275 --> 01:18:55,642
Wendy, open the door
or I'll break it down!

1046
01:18:57,242 --> 01:19:00,409
Hey, you okay in there?

1047
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:04,008
Yeah.

1048
01:19:04,142 --> 01:19:06,509
I just need to sleep.

1049
01:19:26,075 --> 01:19:29,042
Maybe I should have
a lawyer present.

1050
01:19:29,909 --> 01:19:31,642
Something you need a lawyer for?

1051
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:35,975
No, I just don't feel
real comfortable right now.

1052
01:19:36,108 --> 01:19:37,909
Well, you're not arrested.

1053
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:39,642
We're just talking.

1054
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:41,476
You and me.

1055
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:45,909
Anything you wanna tell me?

1056
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:48,409
I don't know nothing.

1057
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:50,609
Don't know nothing
about that dog?

1058
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:52,175
What dog?

1059
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:56,609
Okay, okay.

1060
01:19:56,742 --> 01:19:58,975
Well I know some things.

1061
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:02,309
That your mama left you
when you were 10.

1062
01:20:02,442 --> 01:20:04,642
You never knew your daddy.

1063
01:20:04,776 --> 01:20:09,342
In and out of juvie for years
and years, drugs.

1064
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:12,609
Drugs, drugs, drugs,
petty theft.

1065
01:20:12,742 --> 01:20:15,676
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

1066
01:20:25,175 --> 01:20:29,509
I got a warrant for that van of
yours, what do you think I'd find?

1067
01:20:29,642 --> 01:20:32,843
- Drugs.
- I don't do drugs anymore. I'm clean.

1068
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:36,075
- You're lying. You're lying, Justin.
- I don't. No, I'm not.

1069
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:38,442
Drugs make you lie.
That's what they do.

1070
01:20:38,576 --> 01:20:41,108
They keep you
from being yourself.

1071
01:20:41,242 --> 01:20:43,943
Make you do things
you normally wouldn't do.

1072
01:20:44,075 --> 01:20:45,375
All right?

1073
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:52,509
My son was an addict.

1074
01:20:52,642 --> 01:20:54,042
I didn't even know it.

1075
01:20:54,175 --> 01:20:55,975
That's how good a liar he was.

1076
01:20:57,776 --> 01:21:01,108
Time I found out, it's too late.

1077
01:21:02,342 --> 01:21:03,843
I don't want that for you.

1078
01:21:03,975 --> 01:21:05,975
I'm here to help you.

1079
01:21:06,108 --> 01:21:08,476
But I need you to help me first.

1080
01:21:08,609 --> 01:21:13,175
Now what happened
to the little girl?

1081
01:21:13,309 --> 01:21:15,509
- Yeah, you know something.
- No I don't. No I don't.

1082
01:21:15,642 --> 01:21:18,042
Whether you saw, whether you
overheard something.

1083
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:20,676
You were all around there.
Come on, now.

1084
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:23,275
What, you're trying
to protect someone? Is that it?

1085
01:21:23,409 --> 01:21:26,642
Miranda Hudson, is that it? Huh?

1086
01:21:27,409 --> 01:21:28,676
Mr. Henry?

1087
01:21:28,809 --> 01:21:32,142
I told you... I told you,
I don't know nothing, all right?

1088
01:21:32,275 --> 01:21:33,776
I don't know nothing.

1089
01:21:33,909 --> 01:21:36,909
You don't know nothing about
those two dead people neither?

1090
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:39,075
No, no.

1091
01:21:39,209 --> 01:21:41,175
Well, let me let you in
on a little secret.

1092
01:21:41,309 --> 01:21:43,509
We got a hair of the killer.

1093
01:21:43,642 --> 01:21:46,975
It's only a matter of time
before we know who he is.

1094
01:21:48,609 --> 01:21:51,776
You might wanna look up
that lawyer.

1095
01:21:51,909 --> 01:21:53,375
You might need that.

1096
01:21:58,042 --> 01:21:59,642
Tell you what...

1097
01:22:01,108 --> 01:22:03,142
give him a card.

1098
01:22:03,275 --> 01:22:05,442
Call me, you know where I am.

1099
01:22:05,576 --> 01:22:07,709
Maybe something
will come back to you.

1100
01:22:20,943 --> 01:22:22,409
Baker.

1101
01:22:24,008 --> 01:22:25,476
What?

1102
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:27,409
Shit.

1103
01:22:39,909 --> 01:22:41,442
She gonna be okay?

1104
01:22:41,576 --> 01:22:43,909
She swallowed a whole bottle
of sleeping pills.

1105
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:47,275
We just pumped her. She is gonna be
okay, she just needs some rest.

1106
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:50,209
Her husband's in there
with her right now.

1107
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:59,108
I think we'll see that grief
counselor now, sheriff.

1108
01:23:02,576 --> 01:23:06,442
I want you to know
you're not alone in this.

1109
01:23:06,576 --> 01:23:08,476
You have each other.

1110
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:13,209
It's important
that you lean on one another

1111
01:23:13,342 --> 01:23:15,742
in times of duress.

1112
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:22,409
There are five stages
to losing a loved one.

1113
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:25,975
Although you haven't officially
lost your daughter forever,

1114
01:23:26,108 --> 01:23:29,909
you are still experiencing
a sense of loss,

1115
01:23:30,075 --> 01:23:32,642
and going through those stages.

1116
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:35,742
Denial,

1117
01:23:35,876 --> 01:23:38,509
anger, bargaining.

1118
01:23:38,642 --> 01:23:42,776
I'll do anything
to get my daughter back.

1119
01:23:42,909 --> 01:23:46,309
Placing blame on others,

1120
01:23:46,442 --> 01:23:49,542
<i>and then moving
into depression.</i>

1121
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:53,075
<i>You might fluctuate
between those stages</i>

1122
01:23:53,209 --> 01:23:57,209
<i>until you arrive
at the final stage.</i>

1123
01:23:59,008 --> 01:24:00,609
<i>Acceptance.</i>

1124
01:24:02,309 --> 01:24:04,275
<i>That last stage,</i>

1125
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:07,975
<i>well, in your situation,
staying hopeful</i>

1126
01:24:08,108 --> 01:24:11,476
<i>and supportive of each other.</i>

1127
01:24:13,843 --> 01:24:19,642
<i>In many couples,
a wedge can be created.</i>

1128
01:24:19,776 --> 01:24:21,142
<i>They can blame each other.</i>

1129
01:24:21,275 --> 01:24:23,108
<i>It can erode the marriage.</i>

1130
01:24:23,242 --> 01:24:27,442
<i>But by leaning on
each other for support,</i>

1131
01:24:27,576 --> 01:24:30,075
<i>the relationship
can strengthen.</i>

1132
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:34,709
<i>You must not give up hope,</i>

1133
01:24:34,843 --> 01:24:40,209
<i>but you also must not get stuck
in those other stages.</i>

1134
01:24:40,342 --> 01:24:44,142
<i>It'll lead you
into a downward spiral.</i>

1135
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:51,042
<i>It's a fine line
between denial and hope.</i>

1136
01:24:52,709 --> 01:24:56,975
<i>Acceptance means letting go.</i>

1137
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:05,642
<i>Letting go of that
which is not in your control.</i>

1138
01:25:48,142 --> 01:25:49,509
Hey, whoa!

1139
01:25:51,275 --> 01:25:53,843
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

1140
01:25:53,975 --> 01:25:58,175
Yeah, just returning tapes,
okay?

1141
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:14,609
Hello?

1142
01:31:30,209 --> 01:31:32,175
<i>Come sit on the bed.</i>

1143
01:31:32,309 --> 01:31:35,209
<i>No, I don't want to.</i>

1144
01:31:36,442 --> 01:31:39,142
<i>I'm not gonna hurt
you, darling.</i>

1145
01:31:39,275 --> 01:31:41,709
<i>You don't need to be scared.</i>

1146
01:31:43,142 --> 01:31:44,576
<i>Come on.</i>

1147
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:46,509
<i>Come sit next to me.</i>

1148
01:32:03,008 --> 01:32:04,975
Wendy!

1149
01:32:42,809 --> 01:32:44,342
Oh, shit.

1150
01:33:43,876 --> 01:33:45,975
Have you seen my wife?

1151
01:33:46,108 --> 01:33:47,676
Nope.

1152
01:33:48,909 --> 01:33:50,042
I'm gonna grab some sugar.

1153
01:33:50,175 --> 01:33:52,042
We're closed.

1154
01:33:53,909 --> 01:33:55,576
It'll take you like a minute.

1155
01:33:56,676 --> 01:33:58,442
Make it quick.

1156
01:34:04,876 --> 01:34:06,676
Take it, it's on me.

1157
01:34:08,876 --> 01:34:10,108
Thanks.

1158
01:34:11,409 --> 01:34:13,642
Hey, you sure
you haven't seen Wendy?

1159
01:34:14,975 --> 01:34:16,108
Nope.

1160
01:34:16,242 --> 01:34:17,943
She must've dropped
'em off earlier.

1161
01:34:18,075 --> 01:34:19,375
Oh, yeah?

1162
01:34:19,509 --> 01:34:20,609
Yeah.

1163
01:34:20,742 --> 01:34:22,709
Yeah? About when was that?

1164
01:34:22,843 --> 01:34:25,309
I don't know, we were closed.

1165
01:34:26,576 --> 01:34:28,175
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:34:29,309 --> 01:34:31,509
Thanks for the sugar.

1167
01:36:12,509 --> 01:36:14,309
At around 11 p.m. last night,

1168
01:36:14,442 --> 01:36:17,709
the RV park owner Mr. Tom Henry
was killed

1169
01:36:17,843 --> 01:36:20,209
after attacking Mrs. Michaelson
in the back room

1170
01:36:20,342 --> 01:36:24,309
of the RV front office, which
contained child pornography.

1171
01:36:24,442 --> 01:36:26,476
<i>At this time,
we believe that Mr. Henry</i>

1172
01:36:26,609 --> 01:36:29,075
<i>was behind the disappearance
of Taylor Michaelson.</i>

1173
01:36:29,209 --> 01:36:31,375
We speculate
that he may be involved

1174
01:36:31,509 --> 01:36:33,542
in an underground
child pornography ring

1175
01:36:33,676 --> 01:36:36,275
<i>and may be involved
in the murder of Eric Hudson</i>

1176
01:36:36,409 --> 01:36:38,975
<i>and the disappearance
of his wife, Miranda Hudson.</i>

1177
01:36:39,108 --> 01:36:42,809
We still do not know the
whereabouts of Taylor Michaelson.

1178
01:36:42,943 --> 01:36:46,375
<i>We fear that Mr. Henry has
taken the secret to his grave.</i>

1179
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:49,642
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Michaelson have
asked for privacy during this time</i>

1180
01:36:49,776 --> 01:36:53,242
<i>and are declining
any further press statements.</i>

1181
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:55,476
<i>We ask that if you have
any information</i>

1182
01:36:55,609 --> 01:36:58,509
<i>regarding Taylor Michaelson,
that you please come forward</i>

1183
01:36:58,642 --> 01:37:01,975
<i>and contact the sheriff's
department, thank you.</i>

1184
01:37:05,576 --> 01:37:09,375
Want you to know
this investigation isn't over.

1185
01:37:14,142 --> 01:37:19,309
I will continue to work around the
clock to get your daughter back.

1186
01:37:21,776 --> 01:37:22,943
Thank you.

1187
01:37:23,075 --> 01:37:24,843
We're pulling the teams
from the lake.

1188
01:37:24,975 --> 01:37:26,476
I don't think she's there.

1189
01:37:26,609 --> 01:37:29,342
Gotta focus our manpower
on the leader of that tape ring.

1190
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:31,642
I'm hoping there's
some kind of connection,

1191
01:37:31,776 --> 01:37:34,008
maybe find out where she is.

1192
01:37:35,409 --> 01:37:39,642
Just got off the phone
with the FBI, filled them in.

1193
01:37:39,776 --> 01:37:43,075
They're sending someone up from
their field office up north.

1194
01:37:43,209 --> 01:37:45,809
Should be here
tomorrow afternoon.

1195
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:47,175
Makes sense.

1196
01:37:50,309 --> 01:37:52,242
Try to get some sleep.

1197
01:37:59,975 --> 01:38:01,876
You find anything
in Justin's van?

1198
01:38:02,008 --> 01:38:03,576
Nope.

1199
01:38:03,709 --> 01:38:05,175
Kid's staying quiet.

1200
01:38:06,609 --> 01:38:08,142
Well...

1201
01:38:09,108 --> 01:38:11,042
we have the FBI.

1202
01:38:11,175 --> 01:38:14,375
Try to throw scare
on him tomorrow.

1203
01:38:14,509 --> 01:38:16,409
I'm sorry, John.

1204
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:19,108
I know you wanted this one.

1205
01:38:40,209 --> 01:38:42,242
What are you doing?

1206
01:38:48,843 --> 01:38:51,209
She's not coming back.

1207
01:38:55,242 --> 01:38:57,108
We gotta stop
torturing ourselves.

1208
01:38:57,242 --> 01:39:00,309
Wait... Give... Give me the box.

1209
01:39:03,309 --> 01:39:04,709
No.

1210
01:39:04,843 --> 01:39:06,476
Wendy.

1211
01:39:10,275 --> 01:39:12,409
I can't do this anymore.

1212
01:39:14,442 --> 01:39:15,175
I can't.

1213
01:39:15,309 --> 01:39:17,409
I can't look at this stuff.

1214
01:39:17,542 --> 01:39:21,142
Everywhere I look,
I've been seeing her...

1215
01:39:21,876 --> 01:39:25,042
and not you.
You understand?

1216
01:39:25,175 --> 01:39:28,108
You just wanna throw away every
memory of her, you wanna forget?

1217
01:39:28,242 --> 01:39:29,809
- No, no, no.
- Is that what you want, Paul?

1218
01:39:29,943 --> 01:39:32,442
- Just give me the box. Give me the box!
- No. Wendy, Wendy!

1219
01:39:32,576 --> 01:39:35,642
- Give me this box!
- Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

1220
01:39:35,776 --> 01:39:37,709
I-I...

1221
01:39:39,175 --> 01:39:41,576
I can't do it.

1222
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:43,509
No.

1223
01:39:43,642 --> 01:39:45,242
No.

1224
01:39:47,442 --> 01:39:50,975
I'm not playing
this game anymore, so...

1225
01:39:52,542 --> 01:39:54,075
I'm sorry.

1226
01:40:03,542 --> 01:40:04,542
Taylor's gone.

1227
01:40:06,008 --> 01:40:07,709
Not coming back.

1228
01:40:09,709 --> 01:40:11,742
We need to accept that.

1229
01:40:13,776 --> 01:40:17,476
We need to accept that.

1230
01:43:01,209 --> 01:43:04,108
<i>This is Sheriff
Baker, leave a message.</i>

1231
01:43:12,909 --> 01:43:14,742
Marianne!

1232
01:45:13,075 --> 01:45:14,476
Hello.

1233
01:45:14,609 --> 01:45:17,609
Rakes, we do a background check
on the Michaelsons?

1234
01:45:17,742 --> 01:45:19,209
Yeah, records were clean.

1235
01:45:19,342 --> 01:45:22,843
<i>Dad was a decorated veteran,
nothing else came up, why?</i>

1236
01:45:22,975 --> 01:45:24,108
What about the kid?

1237
01:45:24,242 --> 01:45:27,209
The kid, why would we?

1238
01:45:27,342 --> 01:45:29,476
I mean, I didn't think
she'd have any arrests.

1239
01:45:29,609 --> 01:45:32,242
I'm looking at a picture here
of Mrs. Michaelson

1240
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:33,943
about nine months pregnant,

1241
01:45:34,075 --> 01:45:35,943
in the background
is the Twin Towers.

1242
01:45:36,075 --> 01:45:37,409
So?

1243
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:40,776
So the Twin Towers went down
17 years ago.

1244
01:45:40,909 --> 01:45:44,542
So how could Taylor Michaelson
possibly be 10 years old?

1245
01:45:47,676 --> 01:45:50,676
On that missing persons form,
there's an emergency contact.

1246
01:45:50,809 --> 01:45:51,975
I believe it's his brother.

1247
01:45:52,108 --> 01:45:55,375
- <i>Get a hold of him.</i>
- Shit. Shit!

1248
01:45:56,676 --> 01:46:00,075
<i>Taylor accidentally drowned
in Wolf River Harbor, Canada,</i>

1249
01:46:00,209 --> 01:46:02,609
<i>six years ago
while on an RV camping trip.</i>

1250
01:46:02,742 --> 01:46:06,676
<i>They were in therapy for a
while, but they stopped going.</i>

1251
01:46:06,809 --> 01:46:09,108
<i>They have these shared
delusional episodes</i>

1252
01:46:09,242 --> 01:46:11,576
<i>where they both think
Taylor's still alive.</i>

1253
01:46:11,709 --> 01:46:14,275
<i>It's a syndrome called
folie à deux.</i>

1254
01:46:14,409 --> 01:46:16,609
<i>Sometimes one will be more
in it than the other.</i>

1255
01:46:16,742 --> 01:46:19,142
<i>I mean, they usually just play
this game at home.</i>

1256
01:46:19,275 --> 01:46:21,342
<i>Making breakfast for her,
talking to her.</i>

1257
01:46:21,476 --> 01:46:26,375
<i>The worst it ever got was they took her to
school one day, but no one ever got hurt.</i>

1258
01:46:26,509 --> 01:46:29,809
<i>I thought it was their way to cope,
to keep their marriage together.</i>

1259
01:46:29,943 --> 01:46:32,542
<i>You know, I mean, they can
function in the real world,</i>

1260
01:46:32,676 --> 01:46:35,342
<i>both have good jobs,
so I just told my wife</i>

1261
01:46:35,476 --> 01:46:37,542
<i>to leave them alone
if it helps them.</i>

1262
01:46:37,676 --> 01:46:40,275
Hey, forensics got a match
on that DNA sample found

1263
01:46:40,409 --> 01:46:42,275
in Eric Hudson's ring.
Paul Michaelson's.

1264
01:46:42,409 --> 01:46:43,843
<i>What's happening?
Is everything okay?</i>

1265
01:46:59,943 --> 01:47:01,576
Police, open up!

1266
01:47:03,175 --> 01:47:05,175
- Can I help you?
- There was a couple parked

1267
01:47:05,309 --> 01:47:07,042
in that RV spot,
you see anything?

1268
01:47:07,175 --> 01:47:10,342
Yeah, there was an RV
when we first got here, but...

1269
01:47:10,476 --> 01:47:11,476
but they left.

1270
01:47:11,609 --> 01:47:12,576
You see anyone else?

1271
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:13,642
Groundskeeper, anyone?

1272
01:47:13,776 --> 01:47:15,008
No, no one else was around

1273
01:47:15,142 --> 01:47:16,742
and there was no one
at the front desk.

1274
01:47:16,876 --> 01:47:19,576
Should we be worried?
Are these people dangerous?

1275
01:47:21,542 --> 01:47:23,142
Where's your kid?

1276
01:47:23,275 --> 01:47:25,409
What?
Where's your kid?

1277
01:47:25,542 --> 01:47:27,342
She was out by the swing set.

1278
01:47:27,476 --> 01:47:30,008
Cindy! Cindy!

1279
01:47:30,142 --> 01:47:33,843
- Cindy! Cindy! Cindy!
- Cindy! Oh!

1280
01:47:33,975 --> 01:47:35,843
Cindy! Cindy!

1281
01:47:35,975 --> 01:47:37,309
I'm right here, Mama!

1282
01:47:37,442 --> 01:47:38,476
Oh, God!

1283
01:47:39,809 --> 01:47:42,142
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

1284
01:47:48,142 --> 01:47:52,342
<i>There are five
stages to losing a loved one.</i>

1285
01:47:53,909 --> 01:47:55,409
<i>Denial.</i>

1286
01:47:55,542 --> 01:47:58,542
<i>Everywhere I look,
I've been seeing her.</i>

1287
01:48:00,809 --> 01:48:02,209
<i>Anger.</i>

1288
01:48:02,342 --> 01:48:04,409
- Fuck!
- We don't have anything, Paul!

1289
01:48:04,542 --> 01:48:07,209
Taylor is the only reason
I'm with you! She is the glue!

1290
01:48:07,342 --> 01:48:10,609
What do we have without her?

1291
01:48:10,742 --> 01:48:11,809
Enough!

1292
01:48:11,943 --> 01:48:13,209
<i>Bargaining.</i>

1293
01:48:13,342 --> 01:48:14,975
You understand
that I would do anything

1294
01:48:15,108 --> 01:48:16,275
<i>to keep that from happening.</i>

1295
01:48:16,409 --> 01:48:19,142
I'm not gonna lose both of you.

1296
01:48:19,275 --> 01:48:21,342
<i>Placing blame on others.</i>

1297
01:48:21,476 --> 01:48:23,309
That's Taylor's favorite
necklace.

1298
01:48:27,609 --> 01:48:31,142
<i>Moving into depression.</i>

1299
01:48:34,108 --> 01:48:38,175
<i>It might fluctuate
between those stages.</i>

1300
01:48:38,309 --> 01:48:40,042
We have to tell them the truth.

1301
01:48:40,175 --> 01:48:41,843
I'm not gonna play
this game anymore.

1302
01:48:41,975 --> 01:48:43,175
We're murderers, Paul.

1303
01:48:43,309 --> 01:48:45,309
<i>You must not give up hope,</i>

1304
01:48:45,442 --> 01:48:48,476
<i>but you also must not get stuck
in those other stages.</i>

1305
01:48:48,609 --> 01:48:50,476
Wendy and I are having
a little trouble with Taylor.

1306
01:48:50,609 --> 01:48:54,742
<i>It leads you
into a downward spiral.</i>

1307
01:49:04,342 --> 01:49:09,442
<i>It's a fine line
between denial and hope.</i>

1308
01:49:11,275 --> 01:49:14,542
<i>Acceptance means</i>

1309
01:49:14,676 --> 01:49:16,809
<i>letting go.</i>

1310
01:49:16,943 --> 01:49:18,642
<i>Letting go</i>

1311
01:49:18,776 --> 01:49:22,642
<i>of that which is not
in your control.</i>

1312
01:49:45,409 --> 01:49:48,075
<i>Dad, you want me to feed Lucky
before we go to the lake?</i>

1313
01:49:48,209 --> 01:49:50,476
