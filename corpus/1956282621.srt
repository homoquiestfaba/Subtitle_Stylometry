<i>The only difference</i>
<i>between cowgirls and angels...</i>

3
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,809
<i>my granddaddy used to say...</i>

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,850
<i>is that angels can't ride as good.</i>

Cowgirls 'n Angels (2012)

6
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,854
<i>I wouldn't call myself a cowgirl.</i>

7
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,731
<i>And I'm not much of an angel, either.</i>

8
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:03,054
<i>The truth be told,</i>
<i>I'm not really a rodeo fan.</i>

9
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:08,176
<i>But it was summertime, and the rodeo</i>
<i>was the most exciting thing around.</i>

10
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,570
<i>I'm not exactly your typical</i>
<i>Oklahoma girl.</i>

11
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,692
<i>See, I'm half-orphan,</i>
<i>which means I don't have a daddy.</i>

12
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,491
<i>And my mama works all the time.</i>

13
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,530
<i>So I'm basically on my own.</i>

14
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,776
<i>I did have a granddaddy.</i>
<i>He was a rodeo trick rider.</i>

15
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:35,208
<i>One of the best.</i>

16
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:37,136
<i>When I was real little, he'd tell me...</i>

17
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,454
<i>"It's not enough for a man</i>
<i>to know how to ride.</i>

18
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,570
<i>He's gotta know how to fall."</i>

19
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,929
<i>Well, I couldn't ride a horse</i>
<i>to save my life.</i>

20
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,771
<i>I have to admit, though,</i>
<i>it sure looked like fun.</i>

21
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:54,416
- Yeehaw!
- Hey! What are you doin' in my purse?

22
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:57,611
- Get outta there! Get on!
- Hey! What are you doin' under here?

23
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:58,455
Come here.

24
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,055
Hey, you can't get away from me, now--
Hey!

25
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,174
Just stop!

26
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:25,131
All right. Come on out of there.

27
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:28,334
Hi.

28
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,330
Security guard went that way.
I suggest you go that way.

29
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,097
Thank you, sir.

30
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,972
- Don't let me catch you in here again.
- I promise!

31
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,967
It's okay, boy.

32
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,887
Hey.

33
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,331
Hey, boy.

34
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,051
Come on. Step off it.

35
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,174
Come on. Work with me, boy.
Here we go.

36
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,695
Come on over here.

37
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,289
What are you doin' out here, huh?
All you need is just a little love.

38
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,128
Good boy. Here we go.

39
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,773
All right, girls, listen up.

40
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,171
Real nice job, ladies.

41
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:21,415
Just a few little things I noticed
I think we can improve on.

42
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,009
Nora, when we crack the whip,
you gotta keep up, okay?

43
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,094
I know.

44
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,296
Has to be a tassel--

45
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:41,370
Hi. That was an awfully
great show, everybody.

46
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,936
Thank you!

47
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,290
<i>Like I said, I ain't</i>
<i>much of an angel, either.</i>

48
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:56,134
<i>Yep. The only ridin' I did</i>
<i>was on my old bicycle.</i>

49
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,777
<i>One thing was for sure.</i>

50
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,369
<i>I wasn't gonna tell my mama</i>
<i>I was hanging out at rodeos.</i>

51
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,057
<i>She hated the rodeo.</i>

52
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:09,256
<i>"Rodeo's nothin' but</i>
<i>a bunch of deadbeats", she'd say.</i>

53
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,258
<i>And by rodeo... she really</i>
<i>just meant my daddy.</i>

54
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,654
<i>Hey, Punky Brewster,</i>
<i>just checkin' in on ya.</i>

55
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,815
<i>I know I promised to swing by the market.</i>

56
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:22,409
<i>But we are shorthanded tonight.</i>
<i>You know the drill.</i>

57
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,531
<i>Gotta be somethin' left in the old fridge,</i>
<i>right? Love you.</i>

58
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,692
Love you too.

59
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,775
<i>Mama made it clear a long time ago.</i>

60
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,050
<i>No talkin' 'bout my daddy.</i>
<i>Wouldn't even tell me his name.</i>

61
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:40,849
<i>But just like a Texas Ranger,</i>
<i>I had my ways.</i>

62
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,217
<i>"Elaine...</i>

63
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:54,615
<i>I'm sorry for the sudden departure.</i>
<i>I'll always remember you.</i>

64
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,457
<i>Walker."</i>

65
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:58,968
<i>Can you think of a cooler name</i>
<i>for your daddy than that?</i>

66
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,535
I mean, I'm not tryin' to get down, but...

67
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:06,810
that's only the third rodeo since spring,
and there ain't been a--

68
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,016
Sorry. There hasn't been
a "Walker" at any of them.

69
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,415
I mean, at this rate, my grandkids
are gonna still be lookin' for him.

70
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,897
Okay.

71
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:36,018
All right. Just wait a second. Ho. Easy.

72
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,089
Okay, boy.

73
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,848
Gosh.

74
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,970
You're too big. That's the problem.

75
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:48,338
Point your toes. Keep 'em straight.

76
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:54,013
- Up, up, up!
- Come on strong!

77
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,731
Rose, when you touch the ground,
you gotta jump back up.

78
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:05,971
That's better. Good girl.

79
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,731
Dang.

80
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,247
- Madison, that ain't funny.
- It's funny to me, Kansas.

81
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,291
You just don't have a well-developed
sense of humor like I do.

82
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,653
Don't worry about it.

83
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:26,658
Hey. Okay.

84
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,254
Who was in here last night?

85
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,334
Looks like the gelding got loose again.

86
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,418
What's the matter with that horse,
Augustus? Nothin' but trouble.

87
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,218
Lock was broken. Found this.

88
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:04,492
Come on. Keep up the speed!
You gotta sell it!

89
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,333
- There you go, Terence.
- Thank you, Alice.

90
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,495
And how are you doin'?

91
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:20,168
Well, I get up every morning...

92
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,210
and make it to bed most nights.

93
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:24,295
So I guess I should count my blessings.

94
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:28,976
You hang in there.
You sure do mean a lot to all of us.

95
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,613
Thank you, Alice.
I appreciate the kind words.

96
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:40,218
- Beg pardon, ma'am.
- That's okay.

97
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:42,899
Excuse me, ma'am.

98
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,771
You have a nice day now.

99
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,094
You too.

100
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,210
I swear I was gonna pay for it.

101
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:51,455
Is that why you were
halfway out the door?

102
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:54,218
- No! I was halfway in the door!
- You save your story for the sheriff.

103
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,488
There you are.

104
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,137
Thought I told you
not to run off like that.

105
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,648
- Is she with you, Terence?
- Uh-huh.

106
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,374
Well, it looks like she was trying
to make off with this bottle of aspirin.

107
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,412
It's for my mama.

108
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:10,497
She's got a real bad headache,
and it's extra-strength.

109
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:15,173
Sorry about that, Marta.
I'll give her a good talkin'-to.

110
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,017
Come on, kid.

111
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,337
So, what's your name, kid?

112
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,333
Ida Clayton...

113
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:35,131
Mr. Parker, sir.

114
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:38,128
And how is it that you know my name?

115
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,609
You're Terence Parker.
Used to ride in the rodeo.

116
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,007
You were almost as good
as my granddaddy.

117
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,334
That a fact?

118
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:52,855
Jim Clayton. Ever heard of him?

119
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:04,887
So, how are things at home, Ida?

120
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,130
Everything okay with you and your folks?

121
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,290
Just me and my mama.

122
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,374
Never knew my daddy.

123
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:24,655
Well, you best be gettin' on home.

124
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,169
Imagine your mama's waitin'
for these aspirin.

125
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,495
Yep! Yep. Gotta run.

126
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,771
Thank you, sir.

127
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,337
Whoa, boy.

128
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,497
All right.

129
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:08,611
Okay.

130
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:12,288
I promise I'm gonna get on you.
If you just give me a second, I'll do it.

131
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:16,495
Come on. All right. Good boy.

132
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,809
There we go.

133
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:25,895
Let's go for a little spin, huh?

134
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,408
Boy, slow down!

135
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,490
Come on.

136
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,089
He's a beauty, ain't he?

137
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:54,131
Takes somethin' special
to ride a horse like this.

138
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,454
How'd you feel about
ridin' with the Sweethearts?

139
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:04,334
Don't take this the wrong way, but...

140
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,211
did you forget to take
that medicine that you got?

141
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,011
Come on now. How about it?

142
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,696
What are you afraid of?

143
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,935
I'm about the worst rider in the world.

144
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,411
Sweethearts goin' out on a big tour.

145
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,814
Rodeos all over the West.

146
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:24,534
And Rebecca-- That's my daughter--
She's lookin' for a couple of alternates.

147
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,251
Did you say all over the West?

148
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,694
If I help you,
you gotta do something for me.

149
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,013
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:35,528
No more lyin'. No more stealin'.

151
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,968
You gotta ask your mama's permission.

152
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:40,734
Thank you, sir.

153
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:48,818
Come on. Come on.

154
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,811
No way. Absolutely not.

155
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,691
But, Mom, come on! It's Terence Parker!

156
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,457
I don't care about Terence Parker.

157
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,171
Anyway, you don't even know
how to ride a horse.

158
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:00,652
Oh, well, I do so!

159
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,417
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

160
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,894
Summer camp.
That was two years ago.

161
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,577
The rodeo's no place for a little girl.

162
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:08,576
- It's just a bunch of--
- Deadbeats?

163
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,009
You sure you not talkin' about
what's-his-face picking you up tonight?

164
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,367
He's not that bad.

165
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:19,538
There he is.
No on the rodeo. I got my phone on me.

166
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:21,968
I'll be back by midnight.
You sure you're okay?

167
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,451
I always am.

168
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:41,854
Okay.

169
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:56,055
Just for a little while.

170
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,688
Mr. Parker...

171
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:06,578
"I would be honored, Mr. Parker--"

172
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,894
She really wanted to come out today...

173
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,135
but it's just so hard to get off of work.

174
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:21,847
- Okay. Let's get you on in there.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,935
- In you go.
- All right.

176
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,376
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

177
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:33,691
Now, don't you want to name him first?

178
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,852
You want me to name him?

179
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:46,095
Hi.

180
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,611
Well...

181
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:56,609
I think... that your name
should be Prince.

182
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:01,615
- Prince.
- Prince it is.

183
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:04,811
- Go on. Get up.
- All right.

184
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:08,611
All right, now hold on a second.

185
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,053
First thing I want you to remember
is that you and this horse are a team.

186
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,090
Every team has a leader.

187
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,574
So that makes you the leader
of the Ida-Prince team.

188
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:20,777
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Let's get you on up.

189
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,730
- All right.
- On three.

190
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:24,690
One, two, three.

191
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,248
- There we go.
- All right now.

192
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:29,334
Hi, Prince.

193
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,053
You just hold on to the reins
and tell him where to go.

194
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,012
- You might wanna put your heel into it.
- I got it.

195
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:39,051
I'm sure that you do.

196
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,170
But you still gotta listen to me.

197
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,859
That's part of the deal.

198
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:47,369
- All right? Off you go.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,412
Show him who the boss is.

200
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:54,257
I'm the boss!

201
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,769
- What are you doin' over here?
- I don't know!

202
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:00,417
Get on over there. Go on.

203
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:02,897
That horse should be riding you.

204
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,692
Come on. Faster! All right.

205
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:30,616
- Here's the turn! They're watchin'!
- That's right.

206
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,730
Good boy.

207
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,532
That's it. Now hold him up. Hold him up.

208
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,213
Attagirl, Ida. Lookin' good.

209
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,249
Keep it up, boy. Good boy.

210
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,697
- Good girl.
- Good job.

211
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:00,333
- You're as ready as you're gonna get.
- Here. You deserve it.

212
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:05,448
Better, boy?

213
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,894
Then, Madison, you'll be up, okay?

214
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,975
And then you'll go last on Friday.

215
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:13,414
Howdy.

216
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,495
Howdy.

217
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,849
This here's the young lady
I was tellin' you about.

218
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:19,617
Rebecca, I'd like you to meet Ida Clayton.

219
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,855
You're Jim Clayton's granddaughter?

220
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:24,015
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,216
How old are you?

222
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,934
I'm two years older than Mr. Parker
when he started performin', ma'am.

223
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:38,215
Okay. Well, why don't you go ahead
and show us what you can do?

224
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:40,978
- And you can lose the "ma'am."
- Oh, yes, m--

225
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,493
You gotcha.

226
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,931
Okay. All right, Prince.

227
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:49,894
Okay.

228
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:55,250
- Ride like the wind.
- Thank you.

229
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,493
That's a different way
to get up on the horse.

230
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:02,657
She's learnin'.

231
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,132
Didn't you once tell me...

232
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,171
"You can't make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear"?

233
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:10,496
Come on, now. Just give her a chance.

234
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,774
You gotta admit, she shows promise.

235
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,897
Form's not bad.

236
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:22,408
Let's see.

237
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:35,407
Not bad, Ida.
Thanks for comin' out today.

238
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,130
Thank you, Miss Parker.

239
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,737
Sorry for wastin' y'all's time.

240
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:54,494
You'll fit in just fine.

241
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:58,855
Welcome
to the Sweethearts of the Rodeo.

242
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,697
Seriously?

243
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,057
Wait. I'm in? Thank you, Miss Parker.

244
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,137
I promise I won't be a problem at all
to any of you.

245
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,658
Thank you.

246
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,976
Rebecca, we done?
I got some laundry I gotta fold.

247
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:17,138
No, we are not done. We have
a new member who needs to practice.

248
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,932
And I'd like to try her out
on Friday night.

249
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,778
Congratulations. I'm Kansas. Good job.

250
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,093
Hi.

251
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,255
We'll see if she can really ride.

252
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,495
Race y'all to the well.

253
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,452
Come on, girls! Let's go!

254
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:35,977
<i>I used to think of people</i>
<i>as a great big box of crayons...</i>

255
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:38,408
<i>and each one of us</i>
<i>had our own special color...</i>

256
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,053
<i>that God would scribble</i>
<i>into his book of life.</i>

257
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,251
<i>Only up till now,</i>
<i>I thought my color was "clear."</i>

258
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:55,455
Come on, boy! Howdy, partners.
I'm Ida.

259
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,217
Yeehaw!

260
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:59,978
Why, yes, I'm a cowgirl.

261
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:06,772
Occupied!

262
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:10,209
One second.

263
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,375
Ida, now! I'm late for work.

264
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:14,808
Give me a moment!

265
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:17,974
What?

266
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:19,691
Is that makeup on your face?

267
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:25,252
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
See? I'm just goofin' around. That's all.

268
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:27,939
Oh, Lord. You've discovered boys.
I'll be back by 10:00.

269
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:45,694
Hey, babe. I forgot my purse.

270
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,170
<i>What a beautiful day for a rodeo.</i>

271
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,893
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>We're gonna have us a calf-ropin'...</i>

272
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:18,091
<i>bronco-bustin', barrel-racin' afternoon.</i>

273
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,335
- Ida.
- Hey, Augustus.

274
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,097
- Hi, preacher.
- Howdy.

275
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:23,777
Why do people call you preacher?

276
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:26,618
That's what I am. The rodeo preacher.

277
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,734
So, you, like,
pray for the riders or somethin'?

278
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:35,979
Oh, yeah. Riders, animals,
even new members of the Sweethearts.

279
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,771
Anyone who may need help. Come on.

280
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,493
It's just me and you.

281
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:05,098
Well, now look at you all gussied up.

282
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:06,652
Is your mama gonna make it tonight?

283
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:09,088
My mama, sir?

284
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:11,687
Oh, no. No. She has to work.

285
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:14,049
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

286
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:15,976
Well, get up on there. Let's do it.

287
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,691
- Okay.
- They're waitin' on you.

288
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,775
- Hi, Prince.
- Come on.

289
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:23,050
Yes. Mr. Mack, I realize I am late. But--

290
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:25,534
No. You're not listenin' to me.
I have to go get my daughter.

291
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,772
All right, girls.
If you feel it, I wanna hear ya.

292
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:43,494
Keep your lines tight.
If you make a mistake, just keep ridin'.

293
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:45,098
Kansas, keep an eye on Ida.

294
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:48,135
Hey, Ida, don't be nervous.
Just have fun.

295
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,490
Make a ruckus!
That's what Sweethearts do best.

296
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,257
<i>Sweethearts of the Rodeo.</i>

297
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:56,212
All right! Ride 'em like you stole 'em!

298
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:51,774
Yeah!

299
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:54,213
That's so funny.

300
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:55,931
Step on up, folks.

301
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:59,290
Line up.

302
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,178
Can I have your autograph?

303
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,336
- Wait. You want mine?
- Aren't you the new Sweetheart?

304
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,051
Well, I guess I am.

305
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:11,975
What's it like
to be a Sweetheart of the Rodeo?

306
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,252
It's better than anything
in the whole wide world.

307
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:21,132
Sign mine "No-good stinkin' liar."

308
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,816
- Mom, I swear I can explain.
- Yeah, you always can.

309
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:26,292
- Get outta here.
- That hurts!

310
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:29,411
- Ma. Mama, that hurts.
- Ma'am? Ma'am?

311
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:32,331
I reckon you must be Ida's mom.

312
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,769
And I reckon you must be the one
who put her up to this.

313
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,497
Well, no. Not exactly.

314
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:41,611
She gave me the letter you wrote. But I--

315
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,009
If you actually believe I wrote this, then
you're dumber than I thought you were.

316
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:51,936
Mom! That hurts!

317
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,689
You just ruined the best thing
that's ever happened to me!

318
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:58,094
Pretty sad if this is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

319
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:01,291
Well, how would you know? When all
you care about is your dumb old job!

320
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:05,458
Yeah, I care about my job so much,
I just threw it away so I could look for you!

321
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,537
Right along with any chance
of me ever findin' my daddy!

322
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:10,536
Wait. That's what this is about?

323
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:14,334
You actually think you're gonna just stroll
into every rodeo this side of Louisiana...

324
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,609
and say, "Hi. I'm Ida.
Which one of you is my daddy?"

325
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,172
You're gonna be waitin' in a long line.

326
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,857
Well, maybe if I didn't know his name.

327
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:22,254
But I do, and it's Walker! So ha!

328
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:25,775
What are you gonna do
if you find him, huh?

329
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,130
Transform magically into a respectful
and loving daughter?

330
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:36,655
Baby, listen to me.

331
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,169
Listen. There's only one thing
you need to know about your daddy.

332
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,449
And that's the fact that he deserted us.

333
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:45,934
He did. He deserted us.

334
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:47,731
You just have to accept that and move on.

335
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:52,454
Oh, me? Me, move on?

336
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:56,891
You're the one who keeps him
stuffed in your closet!

337
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:02,487
All right? He is gone. All right? Gone!

338
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:06,974
I hate you! I hate you!

339
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,168
Oh, hey. There's Kim now.
Nice job, girls.

340
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,338
We gotta get all this loaded up
so we can get on the road by 10:00.

341
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:41,178
Sorry, Rebecca, but I'm not goin'.

342
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,450
Well, why not, Kim?

343
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:46,854
Kenny doesn't want me
to be away that long.

344
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,976
I didn't know it was up to Kenny.

345
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,012
I'm sorry.

346
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:00,653
What are we gonna do?

347
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,451
We should bring Ida back.

348
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,412
That crazy lady is not
lettin' her anywhere near us.

349
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,573
After she lied,
I'm not sure I want her back.

350
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:11,054
Well, I think we all knew she was lyin'.

351
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:13,773
I'm just startin' to think
maybe she's too much trouble. That's all.

352
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:16,459
- I think you said that about me once.
- And me.

353
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:19,047
Definitely said that about me.

354
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,295
You even said that about me.

355
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:22,818
Weak.

356
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:47,696
Well, I don't know
what I would do with Ida...

357
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,891
but now that I'm unemployed,
I could really use the money.

358
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,898
Okay. Let me call you first thing
tomorrow morning, and I'll let you know.

359
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,930
All right. Thanks.

360
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,017
Who was that?

361
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,811
Carrie wants me to go to Oklahoma City...

362
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:06,895
and help her with her catering
for a few weeks.

363
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,807
- You gonna do it?
- I don't know, okay?

364
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,850
I'll figure it out.

365
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:23,847
Howdy, ma'am.

366
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,812
- I'm Terence Parker.
- I know who you are.

367
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:34,256
Yeah, well, look, Miss Clayton.

368
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,973
You and me kinda got off
on the wrong foot, and I was thinkin'--

369
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:38,657
My daughter's not ridin' with you.

370
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:40,929
So you might as well
just turn around and go.

371
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:52,534
Miss Clayton, the Sweethearts,
they give everyone a fresh start in life.

372
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:55,378
Sweethearts takes 'em all in
and gives 'em a second family.

373
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:57,330
Well, Ida's already got a family.

374
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:02,769
I know that. And a mighty fine mom too.

375
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,890
How would you know that?

376
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,131
Because I knew your daddy.

377
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:12,293
And I know how much care
he put into raising ya.

378
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,809
Even if you did start out as an ornery
little thing no higher than my knee.

379
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:19,294
Yes, sir. Jim was a good man.

380
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:20,932
And a fine cowboy.

381
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,015
Sure looked out for me.

382
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:25,494
Wish someone
would've looked out for him.

383
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,535
You and me both.

384
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:33,049
I think he'd be proud
to know that Ida was ridin' with us.

385
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,932
Don't you dare tell me what my daddy
would've wanted, Mr. Parker.

386
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,971
And don't you go usin' his memory
for your personal gain.

387
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:43,933
You're right. Sorry. That was out of line.

388
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,288
I don't know if I mentioned
that there's pay involved?

389
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:55,088
Seventy-five dollars a performance.

390
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:59,576
Twelve performance
works out to be about-- about $900.

391
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,533
Times is hard right now. For all of us.

392
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:07,574
I could pay you half up front, and...

393
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:10,813
well, the rest of it when we come back.

394
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:15,049
And I'd be personally responsible for Ida.

395
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:46,411
Girls, now that's not very nice, now, is it?

396
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:48,131
You said we should be
practicing our roping.

397
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:49,897
Not on Sierra.

398
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,212
Yeah, well, they said they was gonna
come see us up in Fremont...

399
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,170
but I'll believe that when I see it.

400
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:10,169
Five years of ridin' rodeos, my parents
have only come to see me one time.

401
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,137
Must be hard for you.

402
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:18,935
- Nope. I don't care one way or the other.
- What about your folks, Ida?

403
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:26,176
Did you hear Chuck Norris found
a way to make butter without churnin' it?

404
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:29,575
He just roundhouse kicks the cow,
and it comes out butter.

405
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,658
- I hate those stupid Chuck Norris jokes.
- No. Do another.

406
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:54,653
- Hey there.
- How can I help you?

407
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,929
I'm Rebecca Parker with the Sweethearts.

408
00:31:58,379 --> 00:31:59,732
The Sweethearts of the Rodeo.

409
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:02,054
- Heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

410
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,057
- Dean Stucky, Selby's manager.
- Hi, sir.

411
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:07,534
Gimme a sec.
Lemme grab your paperwork.

412
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,614
Okay.

413
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:17,733
Careful there, little lady.
This here's some sensitive information.

414
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:21,974
Okay.

415
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:27,412
If you'll just sign those,
I will grab y'all's passes.

416
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,769
You see, Mr. Stucky,
I've been tryin' to call you all day.

417
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:32,015
It's very important
that we get a chance...

418
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:34,892
to practice in the arena
before tomorrow night's show.

419
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,091
- Why is that?
- We always do.

420
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:41,256
The girls and the horses need to
get familiar with their surroundings...

421
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:44,098
so we don't have any accidents.

422
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,057
Dang. I am sorry to say...

423
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:49,773
ring's all booked up tomorrow.

424
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,572
Well, what about tonight?

425
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,297
Now come on.

426
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:58,809
Now you know these gals just gonna
prance around in their pretty little britches.

427
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:00,497
The only accident they may have...

428
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:03,497
one of them may get their makeup
smudged a little dab.

429
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,608
Practice.

430
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:08,015
Look here, Mr. Stucky.

431
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:10,255
My name's Terence Parker.

432
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:14,531
Case you don't recognize the name,
that's me up there on that wall.

433
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,334
Me and my wife started the Sweethearts
of the Rodeo over 25 years ago.

434
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:22,532
Now, all I'm askin' you
is to make that dirt available tonight.

435
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,896
And show these ladies some respect.
If you don't...

436
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:30,011
I'm gonna give you such a whoopin',
you won't sit down for a month.

437
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:32,334
Well--

438
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:36,611
Okay, Mr. Parker. Well--
Why don't I just meet you on out there?

439
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:45,696
She's pretty.

440
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:50,374
Yeah!

441
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,609
I seen her first there, buddy.

442
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:59,296
Come on, Daddy. Please be in here.

443
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:06,414
Are you dumber than a box of dirt?
What are you doin' in here?

444
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,495
- Kansas!
- What are you doing?

445
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:12,328
- I'm trying to find my daddy.
- What is that smell?

446
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:13,414
Come on--

447
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:16,007
What in the Sam Hill
are you girls doin' in here?

448
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:18,774
Nothin'.

449
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:21,174
Looks like somethin' to me.

450
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:25,815
I was tryin' to find out about
a cowboy that I met tonight.

451
00:35:25,939 --> 00:35:30,490
And... Ida must have woke up and
followed me. I'm sorry. It was stupid.

452
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,009
Darn right it was stupid.
If word of this got out to any sponsors--

453
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,891
Nothin' was missin' here.

454
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:38,658
I ain't gonna press any charges.

455
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:41,457
- I was young once too.
- Thank you.

456
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:45,614
It won't happen again. I promise.

457
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:54,734
Mr. Parker?

458
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:56,654
Yeah?

459
00:35:58,379 --> 00:36:00,335
It's me, Ida.

460
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,415
Can I come in?

461
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:04,416
Sure thing. Come on in.

462
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,574
Shut the door and make yourself at home.

463
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:24,856
Is that your sweetheart?

464
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,734
That's my wife, Gracie.

465
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,009
She's beautiful.

466
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:34,255
Yeah.

467
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:38,129
Where's she at now?

468
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:42,492
Well, Ida, I guess you could say
she's with the angels.

469
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:47,372
I'm sorry.

470
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,330
You needn't be.

471
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:51,937
She's in good hands.

472
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:55,453
And I'm doin' okay down here.

473
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:59,811
I reckon we'll be together soon enough.

474
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:06,168
What's on your mind?

475
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:10,932
Well--

476
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:14,814
Kansas. She--

477
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:20,813
She shouldn't take the blame
for something I did, sir.

478
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:23,697
I'm sorry for lyin' to you...

479
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:26,379
about my mama and...

480
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:28,649
for not doin' my chores
when you told me to.

481
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:32,089
And the other million things
that I haven't even done yet...

482
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:34,779
but, I mean, I will.

483
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,971
Yeah, that's all.

484
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:45,170
Okay.

485
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:49,172
Well, I'm gonna go now.

486
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:51,447
Yeah.

487
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:54,014
Okay.

488
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:58,133
Oh, and, Ida--

489
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,567
Yes, sir.

490
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:04,370
Thanks for tellin' the truth.

491
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,490
You're welcome.

492
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:18,529
Why didn't you just ask for help?

493
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:21,537
Yeah, why didn't you tell us
about your daddy? Hey!

494
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:22,614
Kansas.

495
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:25,697
What's your daddy's name?

496
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:30,256
It's Walker.

497
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:33,928
His first name is Walker.
That's all I know.

498
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:37,290
Oh, I get it. <i>Walker, Texas Ranger.</i>

499
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:40,377
Chuck Norris, bad jokes. It's cute.

500
00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:44,094
Wait. Chuck Norris is your father?

501
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:46,414
No. Her father's a Texas Ranger.

502
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:49,212
No, her dad's just a dude named Walker.

503
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:56,889
So, what's your daddy like?

504
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,655
Well, I've never met him before.

505
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:08,568
But I've dreamt about him
more times than I can count.

506
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:12,495
He's always the same.

507
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,658
He's nice, funny and helpful.

508
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:24,455
He cares about me more than anything
in the whole wide world.

509
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:27,617
He's definitely a good daddy.

510
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:32,334
I just know it.

511
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,095
Well, if there's any justice
in this world...

512
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:39,175
I'm sure you'll be
reunited with your daddy.

513
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,409
So, should we start lookin'?

514
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,654
Hey, excuse me.

515
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:55,135
- Any of y'all named Walker?
- No, ma'am.

516
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,977
Do you all know anyone named Walker?

517
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,818
- No, ma'am. Sorry.
- All right then.

518
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,614
- Hey. Either of you boys named Walker?
- No, ma'am.

519
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,092
Thank you.

520
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:07,892
I think there's some guys
down by the breeding barn.

521
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:10,737
Hey!

522
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:15,650
- One of y'all named Walker?
- Honey, I can be any name you want.

523
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:18,293
How about Ricky Rodeo?
All hat and no cattle.

524
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:25,695
So no? Okay.

525
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:28,889
- All right. Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

526
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:31,010
You've only been to one rodeo.

527
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,731
Didn't think it'd be that easy, did ya?

528
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:35,612
Don't give up hope.
We'll find your daddy.

529
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:37,855
I've been waitin' this long.

530
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:40,777
I reckon I can wait a little bit longer.

531
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:09,532
All right now, ladies, keep your spacing.
Don't cut the pin.

532
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:11,695
Terence, there's somethin' wrong
with my stirrup.

533
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,889
Well, let me take a look.

534
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:16,772
- Go on. Back.
- Prince, stop.

535
00:41:16,899 --> 00:41:19,857
- I need a piece of rope.
- All right. Try this.

536
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:23,210
<i>This year's Landon Rodeo Queen,</i>
<i>Jean Simms...</i>

537

538
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:28,329
Ida, you were supposed
to check the saddles.

539
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:30,211
- I did.
- It was your chore.

540
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:33,734
No, it's too thick.
I need somethin' I can tie.

541
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:37,135
<i>Oklahoma's own</i>
<i>the Sweethearts of the Rodeo.</i>

542
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:41,332
<i>And as they get ready to go,</i>
<i>they make some very last-minute details...</i>

543
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:44,656
- What are you doin'?
<i>- Make sure everything is taken care of.</i>

544
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:47,771
- What about your blood clots?
- I won't have 'em off long enough.

545
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:51,369
Ida, you wanna be a Sweetheart,
you pull your own weight, got that?

546
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:52,488
Yes, ma'am.

547
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,930
Y'all are on now, girls. Let's go.

548
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:56,014
All right. That'll do 'er.

549
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,458
- Come on, Dad.
- Go.

<i>Once again,</i>

552
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:34,497
<i>As she'll make her way</i>
<i>around the arena...</i>

553
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,338

<i>and the cowgirl tonight.</i>

00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:46,929
<i>Rose will lay over</i>
<i>the neck of her horse at a full gallop.</i>

556
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:56,531
<i>Once again, a round of applause</i>
<i>for the Sweethearts of the Rodeo.</i>

557
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:09,697
Wish me luck.

00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:13,452
Well, hey there. Annie Oakley.

559
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:16,927
Annie Oakley was a sharpshooter,
not a rider.

560
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:20,657
- Well, I stand corrected.
- Just sayin'.

561
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:23,498
That was some fancy ridin'
you were doin' tonight.

562
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:25,928
Thank you.

563
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:38,219
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't know. Leave me alone.

564
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:39,692
- He's cute.
- Hey there! Cowboy!

565
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:42,094
- Ida!
- What's your name?

566
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,732
Justin Wood. What's yours?

567
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,896
- I'm Ida Clayton.
- Pleased to meet you, Miss Clayton.

568
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:49,055
This here's Kansas. She's a little shy.

569
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:51,613
But trust me,
she's <i>real</i> pleased to meet you.

570
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:53,218
- See ya.
- Stop.

571
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,172
- What are you doin'?
- Don't yell at me.

572
00:43:56,299 --> 00:44:00,008
We're gonna speed things up a little bit
and do a song I wrote called "Come On."

573
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,890
- You wanna dance?
- Sure.

574
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,091
Wanna dance? Come on, girls.
Come on. Let's dance.

575
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:12,369
- All right.
- Come on.

576
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,128
<i>Come on</i>

577
00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:18,337
You can dance.

578
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:21,929
Thank you guys so much.

579
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:23,970
I'm gonna slow it down
a little bit for you guys...

580
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:25,771
and do a father-daughter song.

581
00:45:25,899 --> 00:45:28,891
I'm going to actually get some help
from my special dad.

582
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:31,692
So if you guys would help me
welcome Mr. Doug Grant.

583
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:53,170
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>how I begged you</i>

584
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:56,575

00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:03,935

<i>Girl to go to the junior prom</i>

<i>You thought your world would end</i>

00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,255
<i>Make me smile</i>

594
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:33,894
<i>Knowin'that</i>

<i>You're always there</i>

597
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:44,295
<i>Always there for me</i>

00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:50,978
<i>My baby daughter</i>
<i>Off to Nashville</i>

599
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:54,855
I know.

600
00:46:56,899 --> 00:46:59,367
<i>Hi. It's Elaine.</i>
<i>Sorry I couldn't take your call.</i>

601
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:01,057
<i>Leave a message.</i>

602
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:06,097
<i>Even where we're</i>--

603
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,698
To a great performance tonight.

604
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:09,696
I'll drink to that.

605
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:16,015
So, how did you get a name like Kansas?

606
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:22,893
My mom and daddy said
that I was conceived in Kansas...

607
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:25,852
on a road trip that they took
right after they eloped.

608
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:28,937
- I think Kansas is nice.
- Thanks.

609
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:46,130
All right, let's go.

610
00:47:46,259 --> 00:47:48,090
Rebecca! Justin's gonna take me home.

611
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:50,096
- I don't think so.
- I'll catch up with you later.

612
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:52,335
I wouldn't count on it, cowboy.

613
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,695
Rebecca, what is wrong with you?

614
00:47:57,819 --> 00:48:00,253
You are about as sharp
as a marble, aren't you?

615
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:01,334
Let go!

616
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:04,496
Do you even remember what brought you
to the Sweethearts in the first place?

617
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:06,568
Rebecca, I've changed.

618
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:10,089
Have you? Because last night
you were breakin' and enterin'.

619
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:13,416
And tonight you're throwin' back
longnecks with John Wayne Jr.

620
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:16,053
Looks to me like you're
hell-bent on gettin' sent back to prison.

621
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:18,170
It was a correctional institute.

622
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:22,212
Whatever it was, do you ever wanna
walk through those doors again?

623
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,848
Well, then you gotta stay clean.

624
00:48:28,979 --> 00:48:32,176
And stay away from that cowboy.
You hear me?

625
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:35,138
Yes, ma'am.

626
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:25,692
Hey, Walker, you got them halters?

627
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:27,935
Yeah, I got one right here.

628
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:35,212
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

629
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,295
He kinda looked like her,
but I don't know.

630
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:38,977
What was his last name?

631
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:41,693
She doesn't know his last name.

632
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:45,095
- What you doin'?
- Kansas found your daddy.

633
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,811
- I didn't say that.
- Where's he at?

634
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:48,850
He's at the stockyards.

635
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:50,571
Ida, I said "I think"!

636
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:07,894
Howdy.

637
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,538
Howdy, sir.

638
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:13,970
What can I do for ya?

639
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:18,732
Well, if you don't mind me askin'.

640
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:21,612
Does your first name
happen to be Walker?

641
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:24,012
Yes, it is.

642
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,891
My name's Ida. Ida Clayton.

643
00:50:32,939 --> 00:50:35,578
My mama's name is Elaine Clayton.

644
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:39,135
It's a fine name.

645
00:50:43,379 --> 00:50:46,610
Well, you see, sir, we're from Dalton,
and that's in Oklahoma.

646
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:49,537
But we used to be from Springville,
or at least that's where my mama was.

647
00:50:49,659 --> 00:50:52,890
I wasn't actually born
on account I'm only 12 years old.

648
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:54,418
But that's kind of the point...

649
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:57,053
because she fell in love
with a rodeo man named Walker.

650
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,172
I was just thinking that since his name's
Walker, and he could be my father.

651
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:04,609
You know. Since your name's Walker,
it could be perfect.

652
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:07,128
Your name is Walker, right?

653
00:51:07,259 --> 00:51:09,409
That's good.

654
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:12,337
I mean, you're just
the right age and everything.

655
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:15,934
I was just wondering...

656
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,375
if you could be him.

657
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:22,890
My father.

658
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:29,652
Ida, you seem like
a wonderful young lady.

659
00:51:30,939 --> 00:51:33,055
But I've never been to Springville.

660
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:35,497
I'm sorry.

661
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:47,216
Wait a minute.

662
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:50,888
They didn't meet in Springville.
They met in Kansas City.

663
00:51:57,379 --> 00:51:59,210
I'm from Colorado.

664
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:02,130
I'm pretty sure
I've never met your mother.

665
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:07,339
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

666
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:21,778
Hey, babe.

667
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:31,729
Well, what are you doin' here?

668
00:52:33,419 --> 00:52:35,979
Well, I was on my way to Missouri...

669
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:38,977
and I passed a sign that said,
"You are leaving Kansas."

670
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:42,653
It hit me I'm not ready to leave you.

671
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:48,935
Look, I got a confession to make.

672
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:51,857
I'm not supposed to drink anymore.

673
00:52:51,979 --> 00:52:56,177
I'm sorry. I thought you just bein'
a big rodeo star and all--

674
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:02,098
No, it's just I used to be kinda wild.

675
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:04,972
I guess I got
what you could call a past...

676
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,216
and... I'm different now, but--

677
00:53:10,459 --> 00:53:12,415
Is that okay?

678
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:15,736
Of course it's okay.
You know, I got a past too.

679
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:25,175
So what's this past of yours?

680
00:53:26,939 --> 00:53:29,533
I went to business school for two years.

681
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:33,487
That is not a past.

682
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:35,371
A past is something bad...

683
00:53:35,499 --> 00:53:38,013
like petty theft at least.

684
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,697
I dropped out.

685
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:46,092
- All right. That's a little better.
- Gettin' there?

686
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:47,777
How come?

687
00:53:49,499 --> 00:53:52,297
My parents own this big business...

688
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:55,172
and I was expected
to take it over one day.

689
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:56,812
Yeah.

690
00:53:56,939 --> 00:53:59,851
When I got there,
I just felt like I was penned in.

691
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:01,537
I couldn't breathe.

692
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:06,137
Thought it was my destiny
to be out here and think for myself.

693
00:54:06,259 --> 00:54:08,489
How about you?

694
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:11,853
- Am I happy?
- Yeah.

695
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:15,129
Hopefully the bad times are behind me.

696
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:55,850
Don't I know you from somewhere?

697
00:54:55,979 --> 00:54:59,449
Here I thought you
did all your hidin' in the hay cart.

698
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:03,535
Oh, come now, angel.

699
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:06,014
Tell old Rawley what's all the fuss.

700
00:55:08,859 --> 00:55:10,895
I ain't no angel.

701
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:13,611
Bad day, huh?

702
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:16,371
It's a bad life.

703
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:20,174
Well, I don't know about that.

704
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:22,210
Aren't you one of those Sweethearts?

705
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:25,297
More like one of their stray horses.

706
00:55:27,459 --> 00:55:30,019
Mama was right.

707
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:32,448
I'm such a mess.

708
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,696
He wouldn't wanna have
anything to do with me.

709
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:37,855
Hey. Hey now. Hey.

710
00:55:37,979 --> 00:55:39,970
What are we talkin' about?

711
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:41,657
Boy trouble?

712
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:43,849
You just wouldn't understand.

713
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:47,217
You probably right about that.

714
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:50,968
I never been too good
at relationships myself.

715
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:56,253
But I will say sometimes
it's just as simple...

716
00:55:56,379 --> 00:55:58,574
as that boy not even knowing
there's a problem.

717
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:00,257
You can't give up.

718
00:56:00,379 --> 00:56:02,688
- You gotta get right back in the saddle--
- Wait.

719
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:05,572
- What did you just say?
- About giving up?

720
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,894
No, no. About "not even knowing."

721
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:10,178
Yeah.

722
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:18,015
That's what I'm talkin' about.

723
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:20,653
- Can I have this?
- Well, I--

724
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,256
Well, I'm glad I could be of help.

725
00:56:24,379 --> 00:56:26,370
<i>That cowboy helped me see the problem.</i>

726
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:28,615
<i>My daddy probably didn't know I existed.</i>

727
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:30,730
<i>But if I could become</i>
<i>a famous trick rider...</i>

728
00:56:30,859 --> 00:56:32,736
<i>and get my picture on the front page</i>
<i>of the newspaper...</i>

729
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:34,417
<i>then he would find me for sure.</i>

730
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:40,492
The Hippodrome?

731
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:42,575
You want me to teach you
the Hippodrome?

732
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:44,814
- Why?
- Why?

733
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:46,372
That's right. Why?

734
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:49,411
I can't even get you
to practice your drills.

735
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,734
Well, you said I had what it takes.

736
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:53,850
Well, maybe you do,
but that doesn't mean...

737
00:56:53,979 --> 00:56:55,890
I'm gonna teach you a dangerous trick
like the Hippodrome.

738
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:59,137
Listen.

739
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:02,456
Did Kansas and Madison ever make
the front page doing a Spin the Horn?

740
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:09,249
Not that I know of.

741
00:57:09,379 --> 00:57:11,609
Then Hippodrome it is.

742
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:16,293
I hope someday you find your daddy, Ida.

743
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:17,932
I really do.

744
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:20,656
But whether you do or not...

745
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:24,658
you can't go living your life lettin' all
those yesterdays define your tomorrows...

746
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:26,690
not if you wanna be a trick rider.

747
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,856
You gotta step into that arena
with a clear head...

748
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,412
and a quiet heart.

749
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:34,497
But you don't start out
with the Hippodrome.

750
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:38,931
You gotta learn
every piece of it step by step.

751
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:41,772
Fine.

752
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:43,491
Then that's what I'll do.

753
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:45,735
You don't have to get
all Mr. Miyagi on me.

754
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:53,411
Come on. Relax.

755
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:50,050
That a girl.

756
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:51,692
Easy.

757
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,094
Breathe. Breathe.

758
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:00,094
Good girl. Easy as pie.

759
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:12,730
- Hey.
- Hey.

760
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:16,975
Any news on the sponsor front?

761
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:19,010
You know.

762
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:23,337
"We'd sure love to, Miss Parker, just as
soon as this economy picks back up."

763
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:29,098
I heard there's gonna be a big honcho
from the Cactus Saddlery here tonight.

764
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:32,052
- Really?
- Word is they lookin'.

765
00:59:32,179 --> 00:59:34,329
They'd be great.

766
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:38,895
I know you been praying, Augustus.

767
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:40,975
We all have.

768
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:44,375
But I'm not sure it's doing any good.

769
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:46,490
I mean, every time we get close to it...

770
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,975
it seems like someone
just snatches it away from us.

771
00:59:50,979 --> 00:59:52,492
If God is driving our car...

772
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:56,578
then honestly, it seems to me...

773
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:59,975
he took a wrong turn
a few miles back, or I--

774
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:01,737
Okay.

775
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:03,971
I know you believe, Rebecca...

776
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:07,808
but believin' and trustin'
is two different things.

777
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:10,612
So you think all
my second-guessin' makes me a fool?

778
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:17,531
Just means you've been given a chance
to find out what trust really means.

779
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:19,737
Thank you.

780
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:28,012
I am ready to practice
more of my Hippodrome.

781
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:30,414
- You don't say.
- Well, yes, sir.

782
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:33,611
I mean, I've had my fill
of "waxin' on and waxin' off."

783
01:00:33,739 --> 01:00:36,412
Well, how about we start
on it tomorrow, okay?

784
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:40,327
All right, ladies, listen up.
We gotta look extra sharp tonight.

785
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:43,690
There's gonna be some
potential sponsors in the audience.

786
01:00:43,819 --> 01:00:45,730
Hey, that's good, ain't it?

787
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:48,498
Good. Yeah, that means
we can finally go legit.

788
01:00:48,619 --> 01:00:49,938
Hey, where's Kansas?

789
01:00:57,739 --> 01:00:59,536
I'm just wondering, is this--

790
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,974
Is this just for fun, or what?

791
01:01:03,979 --> 01:01:06,254
Well, I mean, it's fun, but...

792
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:10,095
I think there's somethin' more.

793
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:12,851
Me too.

794
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:17,971
Bye.

795
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:22,970
Come on.

796
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:30,248
Rebecca.

797
01:01:30,379 --> 01:01:32,813
I told you not to see that cowboy.

798
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,930
Rebecca, it's not a big deal.

799
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,777
It's not?

800
01:01:36,899 --> 01:01:40,574
I'm 21 years old.
I should be able to have a boyfriend.

801
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:43,452
You can see him all you want
when we're back home.

802
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:46,651
But you know the rules about fraternizin'
with boys when we're on the road.

803
01:01:46,779 --> 01:01:48,735
I'm not fraternizing with him.

804
01:01:49,659 --> 01:01:53,447
I need you to be focused on the job
that you are here to do.

805
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:55,535
I am focused.

806
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:58,093
Kansas, you see that boy again
while we're out here...

807
01:01:58,219 --> 01:02:00,733
you can say good-bye to the Sweethearts!

808
01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:05,773
Well, you know what? That's fine by me.

809
01:02:05,899 --> 01:02:09,972
'Cause I would choose love
over trick riding any day.

810
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:19,296
What are y'all starin' at?
Tend to your horses!

811
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:23,938
- Howdy, Ida.
- Hi, sir.

812
01:02:42,779 --> 01:02:44,735
Can you imagine it, Prince?

813
01:02:45,939 --> 01:02:47,691
Everyone just watching you and me?

814
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:55,967
Ladies and gentlemen and
worldwide audience watchin' at home...

815
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:59,375
please help me in welcomin'
at only 12 years old...

816
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:02,172
the greatest trick rider in the world...

817
01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:04,494
Miss Ida Clayton!

818
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:07,213
See, Ida Clayton rides for many reasons.

819
01:03:07,339 --> 01:03:09,728
But tonight, she rides
in honor of her daddy...

820
01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:11,770
who doesn't even know that she exists.

821
01:03:11,899 --> 01:03:15,335
She was born to Elaine Clayton
of Dalton, Oklahoma...

822
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,290
and a mysterious cowboy named Walker.

823
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:20,058
Ida's the youngest to perform
the death-defyin' Hippodrome...

824
01:03:20,179 --> 01:03:22,295
in competition!

825
01:03:27,619 --> 01:03:28,335
Hey, kid!

826
01:03:31,379 --> 01:03:33,847
What were you thinkin',
pullin' a stunt like that out here?

827
01:03:33,979 --> 01:03:36,015
- Come on. Let's see.
- My arm.

828
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:37,333
- You all right?
- No.

829
01:03:37,459 --> 01:03:40,212
It's gonna be okay.

830
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:43,936
I'm gonna go get you set down here.

831
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:50,810
How bad is she?

832
01:03:50,939 --> 01:03:54,534
Well, she's a little banged up,
but I think she'll be all right.

833
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:56,251
She's definitely not riding
for a few days.

834
01:03:56,379 --> 01:03:59,177
- Thanks for all your help.
- Well, no problem. Hey.

835
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:00,812
Take care, missy.

836
01:04:00,939 --> 01:04:02,577
Thank you.

837
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:05,657
Great. Now we're down two.

838
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:11,934
- Hi.
- Don't you "hi" me.

839
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:15,369
You was practicin' the Hippodrome.
And I straight up told you not to.

840
01:04:16,299 --> 01:04:17,778
I'm sorry.

841
01:04:27,419 --> 01:04:29,410
- Hey there, sweetie.
- Don't call me sweetie.

842
01:04:29,539 --> 01:04:31,291
Didn't mean anything by it.

843
01:04:31,419 --> 01:04:33,455
I'm Mark Winters, Cactus Saddlery.

844
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:37,935
I'm looking for
the Sweethearts of the Rodeo.

845
01:04:38,059 --> 01:04:40,857
You'd best steer clear of the Sweethearts.

846
01:04:40,979 --> 01:04:44,096
- Excuse me?
- They only care about themselves.

847
01:04:44,979 --> 01:04:46,332
- Is that so?
- Yep.

848
01:04:46,459 --> 01:04:48,256
You'd be wasting your time,
as far as I'm concerned.

849
01:04:48,379 --> 01:04:50,017
And who would you be?

850
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:53,609
I used to be one of their riders.

851
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:55,570
Have a nice day.

852
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:02,572
But I almost had it!

853
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:06,169
The trouble with you, Ida,
is you just don't listen.

854
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:08,976
What?

855
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:13,092
Those men from the saddle company
that were comin' tonight... aren't.

856
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:16,609
What? Did Miss Grumpypants
over here say somethin' to them?

857
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:19,128
No. Kansas did.

858
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:23,292
- This was our big break.
- Then why did you go and hurt your arm?

859
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,887
It wasn't my fault
I went and hurt my arm.

860
01:05:26,019 --> 01:05:29,056
Dang it, Ida.
Whose fault was it then, the horse?

861
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:32,814
Fine. I'm sorry.

862
01:05:35,819 --> 01:05:38,697
Well, you know
what I'm really sorry about?

863
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:41,287
Is that they ever let Kansas out of jail.

864
01:05:41,419 --> 01:05:45,173
Ida, hush. Kansas was there for you
when no one else was.

865
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:49,893
Girl, you gotta stop worrying
about other people's problems...

866
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:53,455
and take a long, hard look at yourself.

867
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:56,218
Maybe you could call 'em up
and explain everything?

868
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:58,455
I don't have their number.

869
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:00,654
Terence!

870
01:06:00,779 --> 01:06:02,815
- Dad!
- Terence!

871
01:06:02,939 --> 01:06:03,974
Dad!

872
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:05,657
Augustus, call 911.

873
01:06:08,419 --> 01:06:11,855
It's all right. It's all right.
He's gonna be fine.

874
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:18,811
Come on. He's gonna be all right.

875
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:23,456
<i>Rebecca pulled everyone from the show.</i>

876
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,491
<i>There was no way</i>
<i>we were performing that night.</i>

877
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:28,894
<i>There was one more show</i>
<i>scheduled at home...</i>

878
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:32,807
<i>but without Terence, it was lookin'</i>
<i>like the Sweethearts were done.</i>

879
01:06:32,939 --> 01:06:34,452
But he'll be okay?

880
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:36,535
Well, Mr. Parker has stage two.

881
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,298
It is treatable,
but he has a long road ahead.

882
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,893
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

883
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:46,498
It's okay.

884
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:48,610
- It's all right.
- All right.

885
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:50,491
It's gonna be all right.

886
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:53,292
You can't let him see you like this.

887
01:06:53,419 --> 01:06:54,977
Hey.

888
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:58,338
Doctor said Terence needs to rest.

889
01:07:08,939 --> 01:07:11,533
What if your mama's cooked up
a big feast to welcome you home...

890
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:14,127
and you're sittin' here missin' it?

891
01:07:14,259 --> 01:07:15,817
She doesn't cook.

892
01:07:15,939 --> 01:07:17,497
Hey, what are you doing?

893
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:22,008
What's it look like I'm doing?
My arm feels better.

894
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:25,128
Don't think your mama didn't miss you.

895
01:07:25,259 --> 01:07:27,136
I promise you. She has.

896
01:07:28,139 --> 01:07:29,936
And I promise you
she's probably just sittin' there...

897
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:32,050
waitin' for you to come home.

898
01:07:45,085 --> 01:07:46,598
Thanks, Madison.

899
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:52,483
All right. Go on now.

900
01:07:55,245 --> 01:07:56,678
You have fun with your mama.

901
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,523
Madison was right.

902
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:39,161
Stop tryin' to replace my daddy!

903
01:08:39,805 --> 01:08:41,204
Stop!

904
01:08:58,085 --> 01:08:59,677
How you feeling?

905
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:03,395
Well, you just rest, Mr. Parker.

906
01:09:38,405 --> 01:09:39,360
Come on, boy.

907
01:09:39,485 --> 01:09:41,760
- She ran away.
- What?

908
01:09:41,885 --> 01:09:45,002
- Prince is gone too.
- We better try and find her.

909
01:10:38,605 --> 01:10:41,119
She looks like an angel, doesn't she?

910
01:10:49,085 --> 01:10:51,963
You'd have been proud of her
out there on the road, Elaine.

911
01:10:53,485 --> 01:10:54,998
She's a real trouper...

912
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:58,197
just like you were when you were her age.

913
01:10:59,565 --> 01:11:00,793
Really?

914
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:07,438
I sure am sorry I lost track of you
after your daddy passed.

915
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:12,354
But I'm real grateful
Ida's brought us all back together.

916
01:11:13,845 --> 01:11:15,244
Me too.

917
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:21,923
Now, this lovely lady here
is Nurse Joan...

918
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:26,402
and she's gonna bust me out of here
for that last rodeo tomorrow night.

919
01:11:26,525 --> 01:11:29,358
I'm gonna appeal
to her sense of adventure.

920
01:11:31,685 --> 01:11:34,802
Would you mind passing me
that box over there on the way out?

921
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:37,004
Bless your heart.

922
01:11:40,205 --> 01:11:42,924
I found this up in the attic
a little while ago.

923
01:11:44,085 --> 01:11:46,553
No idea how long it's been there.

924
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,158
It can wait.

925
01:11:59,005 --> 01:12:01,838
I think your little girl needs to go home.

926
01:12:04,205 --> 01:12:06,082
Yeah. All right.

927
01:12:08,205 --> 01:12:09,558
Take care.

928
01:12:10,765 --> 01:12:11,959
You too.

929
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:35,684
Is that you?

930
01:13:40,245 --> 01:13:42,236
You have your grandfather's eyes.

931
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:44,802
I have your eyes.

932
01:13:47,645 --> 01:13:49,522
You have my stubbornness.

933
01:14:07,285 --> 01:14:10,083
You really miss him, don't you?

934
01:14:10,205 --> 01:14:12,082
Yeah.

935
01:14:13,405 --> 01:14:15,714
- I'm real--
- I like those--

936
01:14:15,845 --> 01:14:18,757
No. It's okay. Go ahead.

937
01:14:19,965 --> 01:14:22,638
Those curtains in my room are real pretty.

938
01:14:23,805 --> 01:14:25,523
I'm glad you like 'em.

939
01:14:27,165 --> 01:14:28,803
I wasn't sure whether to put 'em up now...

940
01:14:28,925 --> 01:14:30,677
or wait till after
your show tomorrow night.

941
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:35,313
I'm not gonna ride tomorrow.

942
01:14:35,445 --> 01:14:37,037
What?

943
01:14:38,365 --> 01:14:40,356
I'm retiring.

944
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,440
No, honey, I'm not asking you to.

945
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,078
I know.

946
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,520
But--

947
01:14:50,645 --> 01:14:54,684
All I ever do is talk, Mama.

948
01:14:56,285 --> 01:14:58,116
When words come cheap...

949
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:01,725
sometimes you just gotta find another way
to say what you really mean.

950
01:15:09,725 --> 01:15:12,193
I missed you.

951
01:15:23,165 --> 01:15:25,042
What time is it?

952
01:15:26,365 --> 01:15:30,677
I wanted to show you the morning paper,
see if I could get you to reconsider.

953
01:15:30,805 --> 01:15:32,955
Terence isn't even gonna be there.

954
01:15:34,965 --> 01:15:39,038
Besides, I'm sure
they'd do far better without me.

955
01:15:40,325 --> 01:15:42,475
I'm just gonna go back to sleep, okay?

956
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:44,436
- All right.
- Love you.

957
01:15:52,565 --> 01:15:54,203
Mom!

958
01:15:54,325 --> 01:15:56,441
You are not gettin'
away from us that easy.

959
01:15:56,565 --> 01:15:58,999
Did you think we wouldn't miss you?

960
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:01,844
We're draggin' you out
whether you like it or not.

961
01:16:01,965 --> 01:16:03,523
Okay, okay, I'm going!

962
01:16:48,885 --> 01:16:51,604
We got a big show tonight, boy,
for everyone.

963
01:16:51,725 --> 01:16:53,761
Gotta help Mr. Terence.

964
01:16:53,885 --> 01:16:56,160
Got the sponsors comin' tonight, huh?

965
01:16:56,285 --> 01:16:58,879
That way,
the Sweethearts can keep ridin'.

966
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:01,200
We've been through a lot together.

967
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:05,201
Thank you for being there for me.

968
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:12,203
Good boy.

969
01:17:14,525 --> 01:17:16,880
- Hi.
- Hi, Ida.

970
01:17:19,325 --> 01:17:21,395
I'm really sorry about the other night.

971
01:17:22,525 --> 01:17:24,880
You seem like a really nice man,
Mr. Rawley.

972
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,482
You can date my mama if you want to.

973
01:17:28,605 --> 01:17:30,721
I'm sure she'd be happy.

974
01:17:30,845 --> 01:17:32,073
No, I--

975
01:17:34,365 --> 01:17:36,720
Ida, I didn't come here to date your ma.

976
01:17:42,765 --> 01:17:45,518
Ida, I came here...

977
01:17:47,005 --> 01:17:48,802
to ask permission...

978
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:51,120
to introduce myself to my little girl.

979
01:17:52,245 --> 01:17:54,395
Why do you need permission to--

980
01:17:57,805 --> 01:18:00,160
People call me Rawley. Rawley West.

981
01:18:01,325 --> 01:18:03,520
But my real name is Walker.

982
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:07,194
And I don't know why it didn't work out
between me and your mom.

983
01:18:07,325 --> 01:18:09,202
I'm sure it's my fault.

984
01:18:09,325 --> 01:18:11,998
I was more bullheaded
than the bulls I rode back then.

985
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:14,564
I didn't know about you, Ida.

986
01:18:17,725 --> 01:18:22,162
And when I saw your confidence
and your determination, it...

987
01:18:24,685 --> 01:18:26,403
convicted me, and...

988
01:18:26,525 --> 01:18:30,882
I can't get those beautiful
brown eyes out of my head.

989
01:18:33,405 --> 01:18:35,077
Hey, you know--

990
01:18:36,365 --> 01:18:39,960
You know what the difference is
between a cowgirl and an angel?

991
01:18:40,085 --> 01:18:41,484
What?

992
01:18:44,365 --> 01:18:46,833
Angels can't ride as good.

993
01:18:56,605 --> 01:18:58,641
Oh, sweet little girl.

994
01:19:01,085 --> 01:19:02,564
Yeah.

995
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:07,481
I'm here now, Ida. I'm here now.

996
01:19:19,725 --> 01:19:23,513
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to rodeo night in Clarksville.

997
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,558
The Sweethearts of the Rodeo...

998
01:19:25,685 --> 01:19:28,153
are a very special set of ladies
I'm gonna introduce you to in a moment.

999
01:19:28,285 --> 01:19:29,923
They ride with a purpose.

1000
01:19:30,045 --> 01:19:32,036
<i>And tonight, they ride for a gentleman.</i>

1001
01:19:32,165 --> 01:19:34,679
<i>He dazzled us with his riding, and</i>
<i>we wanna take care of that gentleman.</i>

1002
01:19:34,805 --> 01:19:36,796
<i>And the Sweethearts</i>
<i>of the Rodeo wanna make sure...</i>

1003
01:19:36,925 --> 01:19:38,961
<i>that he knows he's not</i>
<i>going through it alone.</i>

1004
01:19:39,085 --> 01:19:40,882
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>help me and the Sweethearts...</i>

1005
01:19:41,005 --> 01:19:42,358
<i>and welcome Mr. Terence Parker.</i>

1006
01:19:42,485 --> 01:19:45,716
- Did they just say "welcome"?
- You mean that old coot is here?

1007
01:19:45,845 --> 01:19:48,313
- Dad?
- Guys, come on! Come on!

1008
01:19:57,405 --> 01:19:59,316
There he is! Terence!

1009
01:20:02,685 --> 01:20:06,075
Oh, my gosh!
He's gonna see us perform!

1010
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:10,723
We got a show to do. Come on.

1011
01:20:11,925 --> 01:20:13,517
He's gonna see us ride.

1012
01:20:13,645 --> 01:20:16,398
Well, that means he's feelin' better.
That's all that matters.

1013
01:20:18,725 --> 01:20:19,680
Kansas!

1014
01:20:23,165 --> 01:20:24,757
- What are you doing here?
- Look at you.

1015
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:26,113
I know.

1016
01:20:27,645 --> 01:20:29,522
I heard y'all could use another rider.

1017
01:20:29,645 --> 01:20:31,283
- Got my message.
- Yeah, I did.

1018
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:34,078
- Well, can we go ridin' now?
- Yeah.

1019
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:36,082
- Mr. Parker's here.
- He's here?

1020
01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:37,923
- He's out of the hospital.
- Come on.

1021
01:20:38,045 --> 01:20:40,639
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>here they are for your enjoyment...</i>

1022
01:20:40,765 --> 01:20:43,199
your cowgirls, your angels...

1023
01:20:43,325 --> 01:20:46,044
your Sweethearts of the Rodeo!

1024
01:21:22,685 --> 01:21:26,724
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a very special moment for us this evening.

1025
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:30,365
Last, but certainly not least...

1026
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:33,716
Ida Clayton will perform
a surprise for the man...

1027
01:21:33,845 --> 01:21:36,279
who believed in her
when she didn't believe in herself.

1028
01:21:36,405 --> 01:21:38,794
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Ida Clayton!

1029
01:21:40,805 --> 01:21:43,797
- All right, Ida, you can do it!
- Yeah, come on, Ida!

1030
01:21:43,925 --> 01:21:47,600
<i>Terence, Ida wants you to know</i>
<i>this one's for you.</i>

1031
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:56,758
Yeah. Yeah. Whoo!

1032
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,443
Come on, girl. Come on now.

1033
01:22:09,045 --> 01:22:12,435
That's my girl! That's my girl!

1034
01:22:14,845 --> 01:22:17,643
Wow! Look at that!

1035
01:22:18,445 --> 01:22:21,994
<i>I guess you're wondering</i>
<i>how everything else turned out.</i>

1036
01:22:22,845 --> 01:22:25,598
<i>Well, Terence ended up being just fine.</i>

1037
01:22:25,725 --> 01:22:28,285
<i>Said he had at least another</i>
<i>hundred years or so in those boots.</i>

1038
01:22:28,405 --> 01:22:30,441
Congratulations.

1039
01:22:33,285 --> 01:22:35,924
<i>Kansas and her cowboy</i>
<i>were truly meant to be.</i>

1040
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:38,676
<i>Rebecca said that from now on...</i>

1041
01:22:38,805 --> 01:22:41,763
<i>true love would always trump</i>
<i>rules and regulations.</i>

1042
01:22:41,885 --> 01:22:45,195
- Rebecca, this is Justin.
- I know who he is. Come here.

1043
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:47,034
Welcome.

1044
01:22:47,165 --> 01:22:48,757
Thank you, ma'am.

1045
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:50,557
Thank you.

1046
01:22:50,685 --> 01:22:53,722
<i>The man from the saddle company</i>
<i>was mighty impressed by the show...</i>

1047
01:22:53,845 --> 01:22:56,154
<i>and very excited about striking</i>
<i>a sponsorship deal...</i>

1048
01:22:56,285 --> 01:23:00,039
<i>to keep the Sweethearts of the Rodeo</i>
<i>riding for years to come.</i>

1049
01:23:05,165 --> 01:23:06,837
<i>As for my mama and daddy...</i>

1050
01:23:06,965 --> 01:23:09,035
<i>I don't claim to know</i>
<i>what the future will bring.</i>

1051
01:23:09,165 --> 01:23:12,953
<i>But I'm hoping the spark that once burned</i>
<i>so brightly between them...</i>

1052
01:23:13,085 --> 01:23:15,440
<i>just might rekindle itself.</i>

1053
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,322
<i>And as for me...</i>

1054
01:23:19,445 --> 01:23:21,436
<i>well, I sure learned how to fall...</i>

1055
01:23:21,565 --> 01:23:24,079
<i>but I do believe</i>
<i>that I also learned how to fly.</i>

1056
01:23:24,205 --> 01:23:27,515
<i>After all, I had gone</i>
<i>searchin'for my daddy...</i>

1057
01:23:27,645 --> 01:23:29,601
<i>but did one better.</i>

1058
01:23:29,725 --> 01:23:31,363
<i>I found myself.</i>

1059
01:23:32,885 --> 01:23:38,482
<i>Yep, it was like the good Lord himself</i>
<i>was smilin'down on all of his cowgirls.</i>

1060
01:23:38,605 --> 01:23:41,995
<i>Of course, the only difference</i>
<i>between cowgirls and angels...</i>

1061
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:44,161
<i>my daddy once told me...</i>

1062
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:46,958
<i>is that angels just can't ride as good.</i>
