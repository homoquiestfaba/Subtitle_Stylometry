1
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,460
Nibiru, M class planet

2
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,250
Damn it man,
that was our ride.

3
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:35,254
You just stunned our ride.

4
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:37,518
Great...

5
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,938
Run!

6
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:49,438
- What the hell did you take.
- I have no idea but they were valued to him.

7
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:53,051
Kirk to shuttle 1, both
of us is out of the kill zone.

8
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:54,164
Your are clear, repeat...

9
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:58,513
Spock, get in there and neutralize
the volcano let's get out of here.

10
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:06,532
We have do this now!

11
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:09,667
I told the Captain, the shuttle
was not built to this kind of heat.

12
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:12,023
Captain, did any one
indigenous life forms see you.

13
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:13,626
No, Mr. Spock they did not.

14
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:16,365
The prime directive clearly states
that there cannot be no interference,

15
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:18,381
with the internal development
of alien civilizations.

16
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:22,135
I know what it says which is why
I'm running through jungle, wearing a disguise.

17
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:25,165
Now, drop off your
super ice-cube, and let's go!

18
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,324
- Kirk out.
- You are good.

19
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:29,807
If we are going to do this,
we got to do it now.

20
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:32,111
Ash is killing our coils.

21
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:33,884
Are you sure you don't
want me go instead.

22
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,422
That would be highly illogical as I'm
already outfitted in heat resistance...

23
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:38,175
Spock, I was kidding.

24
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:42,246
- You got this.
- Guys, we have to go, now!

25
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:53,295
They are trying to kill us!

26
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:55,601
They are trying to kill us!

27
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:57,998
I'll see you in 90 seconds.

28
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:04,372
Do it... do it!

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,373
H-two, seven, three...

30
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:28,051
I can't hold this position,
Spock, I'll got to pull you back up!

31
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,051
Negative. This is our only
chance to save the species.

32
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:33,302
If this volcano erupts,
the planet dies.

33
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:37,727
Pull back up! Now!

34
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,450
Spock, are you okay?

35
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:04,294
I'm surprisingly, alive.
Standby.

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,398
We have to get him back!
I suit up and go down.

37
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,608
- We have to abandon the shuttle.
- We cannot just leave him there.

38
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:10,686
We don't have a choice.
Uhura, I'm sorry.

39
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:13,864
Spock, we are going back to the Enterprise.
We get you out of there.

40
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,212
Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle.

41
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:18,763
- You must make it to Enterprise
on your own. - Wonderful.

42
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,728
- Uhura, are you ready to swim?
- I'm ready.

43
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,382
Jim, the beach
is that way.

44
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:30,484
I know, we don't
going to the beach!

45
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,520
Oh, no, no!

46
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,460
I hate this!

47
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,645
I know you do!

48
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:26,688
Do you have any idea, how ridiculous is
to hide a starship on the bottom of the ocean.

49
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:28,843
We've been doing this since last night.
The salt-water is going to erodes...

50
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:31,174
Scotty! Where is Spock?

51
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:33,340
Still in the volcano, sir.

52
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,089
Captain on the bridge!

53
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,524
Lieutenant, do we have
an open channel for Mr. Spock?

54
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,856
The heat is frying his comms
but we still have a contact.

55
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,238
Spock!

56
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,283
I activated the device, Captain.

57
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:29,311
When the countdown is complete
the reaction should render the volcano inert.

58
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, that's going
to render him inert.

59
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,782
- Should we have use of the transporters?
- Negative, sir.

60
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,480
- Not with this kind of magnetic field...
- I need to beam Spock back to the ship.

61
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,845
Give me one way to do it.

62
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,718
Maybe if we have
direct line of sight...

63
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,190
No way. You are talking
about an active volcano.

64
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,500
Sir, if that thing erupts, I can't guarantee
that will withstand the heat.

65
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,400
I do not know if we can maintain
that kind of altitude.

66
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,679
Our shuttle was concealed by the ash cloud,
but the Enterprise is too large.

67
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:54,200
If utilized in a rescue effort,
it would be revealed to the indigenous species.

68
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,951
Spock, nobody knows the rules better than you,
but there got to be an exception.

69
00:06:57,998 --> 00:07:00,694
Non. Such action
violates prime directive.

70
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,810
Shut up, Spock!
We are trying to save you, damn it!

71
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:05,654
Doctor, the needs of the many
out weight needs of the few.

72
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,309
Spock we are
talking about your life.

73
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:09,820
The rule cannot be
violated in any case...

74
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:11,421
Spock!

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,379
Try to get him back on-line.

76
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:15,253
90 seconds to detonation.

77
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,419
If Spock were here
and I was there, what would he do?

78
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,207
He lets you die.

79
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,508
Spock!

80
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:10,326
You are all-right?

81
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:12,700
Captain, you let them
see our ship.

82
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,141
He is fine.

83
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,267
- Bridge to Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

84
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:19,893
- Is Commander Spock on board, sir?
- Safely and sound.

85
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,994
Please notify him that,
the device successfully detonated.

86
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,031
<i>You heard that?
Congratulations, Spock!</i>

87
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:28,230
You just saved the world.

88
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:32,902
- You violated the prime directive.
- Ah, come on Spock, they saw us big deal.

89
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,750
-Subs  by the 24hpie-
Corrected and synced by: Szaki

90
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,977
I can save her.

91
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,502
What did you say?

92
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:17,284
Your daughter.

93
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,140
I can save her.

94
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,731
Who are you?

95
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:43,991
Jim, come on,
Let it go.

96
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,919
You are not actually
answer that, are you?

97
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,762
San Francisco,
Starfleet Headquarters

98
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:52,299
Spock, I'm telling you
this why he called, I can feel it.

99
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:55,200
Your feelings aside,
I consider highly unlikely,

100
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,936
we will be selected
for the new program.

101
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,272
Why else would Pike
want to see us?

102
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,404
Forget about seniority, they gave
us the newest ship in the fleet.

103
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:05,849
- And who else they going to send out.
- I can think numerous the possibilities...

104
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,476
A five-year mission, Spock.

105
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:11,287
That's deep space, that's uncharted
territories, think incredible that's going to be.

106
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:13,574
Hello, ladies!
Jim Kirk.

107
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:17,111
- Uneventful.
- Admiral?

108
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:19,853
That's the way you describe
the survey in Nibiru in Captain's log.

109
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:22,213
Yes sir, I didn't want to waste your time
going with the details.

110
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:24,053
Tell me more about this volcano.

111
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:27,401
Data says was highly volatile. If it would
be erupt, it would wipe out the planet?

112
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:30,762
- Let's hope it doesn't, sir.
- Something tells me it won’t.

113
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:34,532
Well sir, volatile is all relative.
Maybe our... data was off.

114
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:39,150
Or maybe it didn't erupted, because Mr. Spock
detonated a cold fusion device inside it,

115
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:43,387
right after a civilization that's
barely invented the wheel,

116
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:46,336
happen to see a starship
rising out their ocean.

117
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:48,954
That's pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

118
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:51,945
- Admiral... - You filed a report?
Why did you not tell me?

119
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,550
I correctly assumed that you would
be truthful in your Captain's log.

120
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:56,490
Yeah, I'd would been
if I didn't have to save your life.

121
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:58,187
A fact for which I'm
deeply grateful

122
00:13:58,188 --> 00:14:01,521
and very reason I felt necessary to take
responsibility for the actions taken by...

123
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,499
Oh, yeah don't be so noble pointy
if you also throwing me under the bus.

124
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,397
- Pointy? Is that a derogative
reference? - Gentlemen.

125
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:12,787
Starfleet's mandate is to explore-
and to observe, not to interfere.

126
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:15,019
Had the mission had
gone as planned, admiral,

127
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,331
Indigenous species would be never
been aware of our interference.

128
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:19,597
- That's a technicality.
- I am Vulcan, sir.

129
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,645
- We in-praise technicality.
- You giving me attitude, Spock.

130
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:24,209
I'm expressing multiple attitudes
simultaneous, sir.

131
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,667
- To which you are referring to?
- Out.

132
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,491
You're dismissed, Commander.

133
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:43,082
- Do you have any idea what
a pain in the ass, you are? - I think so, sir.

134
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:46,569
So, tell me what did you wrong?
What's the lesson to be learned here?

135
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,577
- Never trust a Vulcan. - I see,
you cant even answer the question.

136
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,158
You lied on a, official report,
you lied.

137
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,980
You think the rules don't apply to you
because you disagree with them?

138
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,979
That's why you talk me into signing up in first place.
That's why you gave me your ship.

139
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,931
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you...

140
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,864
And now I see you don't
have got ounce of humility.

141
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:07,500
- What I suppose to do? Let Spock die?
- You are missing the point.

142
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:09,233
I don't think I'm, sir.
What would you have done?

143
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:12,823
I would not risked my first officers
life in the first place.

144
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:16,450
You suppose to survey a planet
not alter its destiny.

145
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:20,850
You violated dozens starfleet regulations and
almost got everyone under your command killed.

146
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:23,658
But except I didn't, you know
how many crew have I lost since...

147
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:25,423
- That's your problem! - Since I took command?
- This and the defect is.

148
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,380
- You think you're infallible. - Not one.
- You think not you can't make mistakes,

149
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,019
It's a pattern with you.

150
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:31,386
- That the rules are for the other people.
- Some should be.

151
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:35,402
And what's worse is you using
plain luck to justify, you playing God!

152
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:41,567
Given the circumstances, this has been
brought to admiral Marcus attention.

153
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:44,836
He convened a special tribunal
to which I was not invited.

154
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:49,254
You understand what's starfleet
regulations mandate be done in this point?

155
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:54,588
They taken Enterprise
away from you...

156
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,630
They are sending you
back to the academy.

157
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:04,148
Admiral, listen.

158
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:06,165
No, why should I listen?

159
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,106
You don't listen anybody but yourself!
Every decision I've made...

160
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:10,727
I can't listen.

161
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:14,304
You don't comply with the rules,
you don't take responsibility for anything,

162
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,816
and you don't respect the chair.

163
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,655
You know why?

164
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,459
Because you're not ready for it.

165
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:41,669
LONDON

166
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:51,921
Transmission sent
to: admiral Marcus

167
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:48,366
- How did you find me?
- I know you better than you I think you do.

168
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:53,428
When I first time found you
was in a dive-bar like this.

169
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:56,850
Remember that? Got your ass
handed to you.

170
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,341
- No it didn't.
- You don't?

171
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:01,871
- No, it wasn't what happen...
- That was an epic beating.

172
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,213
No, it wasn't.

173
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:06,926
You had napkins hanging
out of your nose... did you not?

174
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,296
Yeah, that was a good fight.

175
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:13,387
A good fight?

176
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:19,107
I think that's your problem
right there.

177
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:25,491
They gave it back to me.

178
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,358
The Enterprise.

179
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,425
Congratulations!

180
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:46,127
Watch your back with
that first officer, thou.

181
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,497
Spock not going to work
with me, he is been transferred.

182
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:53,295
USS Bradbury.

183
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:57,747
You are going to be
my first officer.

184
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,608
Yeah, Marcus took
some convincing...

185
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:05,046
But any now and then
I can make a good case.

186
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:11,961
- What did you tell him?
- The truth...

187
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,870
That I believe in you.

188
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,517
And if anybody deserves
a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.

189
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,826
I don't know what to say.

190
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,962
That is a first.

191
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:37,527
It's going to be okay, son.

192
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,016
An emergency session
at the Daystrom.

193
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:50,410
- That's us.
- Yeah.

194
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,406
Suit up.

195
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:12,652
- Captain. - Not any more,
Spock, first officer.

196
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:16,580
I was demoted
and you were resigned.

197
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,341
It's fortunate that the consequences
were not more severe.

198
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,889
You gotta be kidding me!

199
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,319
- Captain, my intention was not...
- Not Captain.

200
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:26,890
I saved your life Spock. You
wrote a report, I lost my ship.

201
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:33,058
Commander, I see now I should
alerted to the fact I submitted the report.

202
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:37,681
Now I'm, familiar with your compulsion to follow
the rules, but, see I cant do that.

203
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:42,016
Where I come from, if someone saves
your life you don't stab him at the back.

204
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,663
Vulcan's cannot lie.

205
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,928
Then I'm talking to
the half-human part of you.

206
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:49,992
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

207
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:53,359
Commander Spock?
I'm Frank Abbott, USS Bradbury.

208
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,699
Guess you are with me.

209
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:58,574
Yes, Captain.

210
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:08,871
The truth is
I'm going to miss you.

211
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,873
<i>Admiral Marcus, sir.</i>

212
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,517
Thank you for meeting
on such short notice.

213
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:24,723
Be seated.

214
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,965
By now some of you heard
what happened in London.

215
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:33,175
The target was a starfleet data archive,
now it's a damn hole in the ground.

216
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,145
42 men and women are dead.

217
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,148
One hour ago, I received a message
from starfleet officer,

218
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:40,557
who confessed to
carrying out this attack.

219
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:44,566
That he been forced to do this by this man,
Commander John Harrison.

220
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:49,119
He's one of of our own and he's the man
responsibility this act of savagery.

221
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:53,822
For reasons unknown, John Harrison has just
declared one man war against starfleet.

222
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:59,172
Under no circumstances are we to allowed
this man to escape Federation space.

223
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:04,110
You here tonight represent the senior
command of all the vessels in the region.

224
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,357
And in the name of those
that we lost...

225
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:09,277
You will run this bastard down.

226
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,193
This is a manhunt, pure and
simple so let's get to work.

227
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,318
Earth perimeter sensors hasn't detected
any warp signatures leaving the system,

228
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,559
so we know he cannot be far.

229
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,091
You park ships at
blockade formation,

230
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:24,497
and deploy search vehicles
and landing parties,

231
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:26,544
to run down every lead.

232
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,998
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people...

233
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:33,561
so rules of engagement are simple
if you come across this man

234
00:24:33,562 --> 00:24:36,662
and you or your life
lies those nearby

235
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:40,561
you are authorized to use
deadly force on the subject.

236
00:24:40,572 --> 00:24:42,280
- What's in the bag?
- James, not now!

237
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,655
Does it seem odd that he targeted
an archive? It's like bombing a library.

238
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:47,950
Chris, is everything okay there?

239
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:52,723
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acquainting
to his new position as first officer.

240
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:56,140
If you have something to say,
Kirk, say it tomorrow is too late.

241
00:24:58,047 --> 00:24:59,928
I'm fine, sir,
my apologies.

242
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,198
Spit it out son, don't be shy.

243
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,480
Why the archive?

244
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:10,439
All that information is public record...
if he really wanted to damage starfleet.

245
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,432
- This could be just the beginning.
- Beginning of what, Mr. Kirk?

246
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:18,427
Sir, in event of attack,
protocol mandates...

247
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:21,781
that senior commands gather,
Captains and first officers

248
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,242
at Starfleet Headquarters,
right here.

249
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:25,830
In this room.

250
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:30,099
<i>It is curios Harrison would Commander
a jump ship without warp capability...</i>

251
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:37,780
Clear the room!

252
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:48,213
We need air defense team,
Daystrom conference room.

253
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:05,414
Go, go, hurry!

254
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:18,669
- Yeah? - Commander, Mr. Scott has found
something in wreckage of Harrison's ship,

255
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,247
He asked to see us right away.

256
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,149
Captain, I found this in the crashed jump ship, sir.
This is how the bastard got away.

257
00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:30,131
- What do you mean?
- It's a portable transwarp beaming device.

258
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,862
- Can you figure out where he went?
- I already did, sir and you are not going to like it.

259
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:39,998
He gone to the one place
we just cannot go.

260
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:45,011
Admiral, sir, he is
not on Earth.

261
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:47,999
He is on Kronos, sir.

262
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:51,985
I request my command to be reinstated
and your permission to go after him.

263
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:55,749
Give us a minute.

264
00:30:56,082 --> 00:30:57,477
- Kronos?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,924
So Harrison has gone
to the Klingon home world?

266
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,907
- Is he defecting?
- We are not sure, sir.

267
00:31:01,908 --> 00:31:04,145
He has taking refugee in the Keth
province, region uninhabited...

268
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:08,292
He got to be hiding there, sir. He knows if we even
go near Klingon space, it will be all out war.

269
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,561
Starfleet can't go
after him, but I can.

270
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,879
Please, sir.

271
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:18,300
All out war with the Klingons
is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

272
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:20,047
If you ask me,
it's already has begun.

273
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,249
Since we first learned
of their existence, the Klingon Empire,

274
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,820
conquered and occupied
two planets that we know of,

275
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:27,846
fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

276
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:31,963
They are coming are way.

277
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:35,019
London was not an archive.

278
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:39,256
It was top secret branch of starfleet
designated to Section 31.

279
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,224
They were developing
defensive technologies,

280
00:31:41,225 --> 00:31:43,738
training our officers to gather
intelligence on Klingons,

281
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,705
And any other potential enemy
means to do us harm.

282
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:48,729
Harrison was one of
our top agents.

283
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,757
Now he's a fugitive and
I want to take him out.

284
00:31:52,984 --> 00:31:56,326
Pike always said you're one
of our best and brightest.

285
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:58,894
You should have heard him
defend you.

286
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:02,581
He was the who talk you
to joining starfleet, wasn't he?

287
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:04,112
Yes, sir.

288
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:07,127
Did he ever tell you
who talk him into joining?

289
00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:13,317
His death is on me.

290
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,635
And yours won't be.

291
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:17,093
Sir, please, all I...

292
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:20,227
Mr. Spock, you said that the province
where Harrison is hiding uninhabited?

293
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:21,882
Affirmative, sir.

294
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:28,814
As part of our defensive strategy,
31 developed a new photon torpedo.

295
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,593
Long range, untraceable.

296
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:35,114
You will be invisible
Klingon sensors.

297
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:37,984
I don't want you hurt,
but I want to take him out.

298
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:42,563
You park on the edge of the Neutral Zone,
you lock on to Harrison’s position,

299
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,703
You fire, you kill him
and hall ass.

300
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:49,177
Permission to restate Mr. Spock
as my first officer.

301
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:52,033
Granted.

302
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:00,739
Jim?

303
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,633
- Where were you?
- For what?

304
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:07,078
Your medical exam. 10 hours ago,
you were at damn fire-fight.

305
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:09,497
- Now, It's my duty to...
- I'm fine, Bones.

306
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,652
Hell you are!

307
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:14,939
I'm fine.

308
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:21,167
Status report, Mr. Spock.

309
00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:24,943
The Enterprise should be ready
for launch by the time we arrive.

310
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:26,658
Good, good.

311
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:28,211
Captain.

312
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,846
Thank you requesting
my reinstatement.

313
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,938
You are welcome.

314
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:38,404
As I'm again your first officer, it is now my duty,
strongly object to our mission perimeters.

315
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:39,702
Of course it is.

316
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:43,114
There are no starfleet regulations
that condemns a man to die without trial.

317
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:45,448
Something you and
admiral Marcus are forgetting.

318
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:49,431
Also, preventively firing torpedoes
at the Klingon home-world.

319
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:53,063
You yourself said that the area is uninhabited.
There is going to be only one casualty.

320
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,386
In case you weren't listen our orders
have nothing do with starfleet regulations.

321
00:33:56,387 --> 00:33:58,757
Wait a minute, we are firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

322
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:01,118
Regulations aside this
action is morally wrong.

323
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,100
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of the volcano was morally right.

324
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:05,887
- And didn't win any point for that.
- Jim, calm down.

325
00:34:05,888 --> 00:34:08,045
I'm not going take
ethic lessons from a robot.

326
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,293
Resorting to name calling suggest that you are
defensive, therefore find my opinion valid.

327
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:14,808
I wasn't asking for your opinion.
Bones, get that thing off my face!

328
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:17,865
Captain, our mission could
start a war with the Klingons,

329
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:19,698
and is by very definition
is immoral.

330
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,226
Perhaps, you should take requisite time
to arrive to this conclusion for yourself.

331
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:25,500
Captain Kirk.

332
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:30,186
Science officer Wallace. I've been
signed to Enterprise by admiral Marcus.

333
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,454
These are my transfer orders.

334
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:36,651
- You requested an additional
science officer, Captain? - I wish I had.

335
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,577
Lieutenant Carol Wallace
doctor in applied physics,

336
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:44,406
specializing in advanced weaponry.

337
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,718
- Impressive credentials.
- Thank you.

338
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,055
But redundant now that I'm back
on-board the Enterprise.

339
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:51,989
And yet, more than merrier,
have a seat, Doctor.

340
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,997
Shuttle crew, standby for lift off.

341
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:23,401
No, I'm not signing anything, now,
get these bloody things off of my ship.

342
00:35:23,402 --> 00:35:25,344
- Is there are problems, Mr. Scott?
- Aye, sir,

343
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:27,418
I was just explaining
to this gentlemen,

344
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,912
I can’t authorize any weapons on board this
ship without knowing what's inside them.

345
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:33,686
- Mr. Scott rises yet another point.
- Report to the bridge.

346
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,287
Captain!

347
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:39,047
Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns
but we need these torpedoes on board.

348
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,800
Due respect, sir, but
photon torpedoes run on fuel.

349
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:44,008
Now I can not even detect
the type what fuel

350
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,921
is in compartments, on these
torpedoes, because they are shielded.

351
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:48,851
Now I asked for the specs,
but he said...

352
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:50,690
- Classified.
- It’s classified.

353
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,359
So, I said, no specs,
no signature!

354
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,746
Captain.

355
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:58,122
- Flight checks completed. We are good
to go, sir. - Thank you, Mr. Sulu.

356
00:35:58,124 --> 00:36:01,365
Now, if will you excuse me, sir,
I' have warp core to prime.

357
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,043
Get down.

358
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:06,116
- Jim, your vitals way off.
- Report to med bay.

359
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:09,408
Scotty! I need you to approve
those weapons.

360
00:36:09,412 --> 00:36:11,900
- Do you know what is this, Captain?
- I have no time for a lecture, Scotty.

361
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:14,815
- Do you know what is this?
- Its a warp core.

362
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,717
It's a radioactive catastrophe
waiting to happen.

363
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,378
A sudden shift in magnetic
output from, say,

364
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,756
firing one or more of 6 dozen
torpedoes with unknown payload,

365
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:27,397
could start a chain reaction which will
kill every living thing on this ship.

366
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:30,288
Letting those torpedoes on board
Enterprise is the last straw.

367
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,286
- What was the first straw?
- What was the...

368
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,161
There are plenty of straws,

369
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,915
How about starfleet confiscating
my transwarp equation

370
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:39,562
now some madman using it now
to hop a cross the galaxy.

371
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,553
- Where do you think he got it from?
- We have orders, Scotty.

372
00:36:41,556 --> 00:36:43,448
That's what scares me.

373
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,050
This is clearly
a military operation.

374
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:50,000
Is that we are now?
Cause, I thought we were explorers.

375
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,934
Sign for the torpedoes.
That's an order!

376
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:57,016
Right, well you don't leave me
no choice than resign my duties.

377
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,537
- Come on, Scotty.
- You are giving me no choice, sir.

378
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,834
- You don't give much of a choice.
- I will not stand by...

379
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:03,305
Make an exception
and sign it!

380
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,731
- Do you accept my resignation or not?
- I do!

381
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,848
I do.

382
00:37:15,906 --> 00:37:18,018
You are you're relieved, Mr. Scott.

383
00:37:27,408 --> 00:37:28,781
Jim.

384
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,258
For the love of God.
Do not use those torpedoes.

385
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,997
Captain, I'm so sorry
about admiral Pike.

386
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,738
We all are.

387
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:01,437
- Are you okay?
- Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.

388
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:08,702
Actually, Scotty just quit,

389
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:13,018
and your boyfriend second guessing
me every chance he gets.

390
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:18,873
I'm sorry, that was impropriety.
It just some times I want to rip

391
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:21,514
those thing of his head.

392
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:26,080
- Hell maybe it's me.
- It’s not you.

393
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:28,554
It’s not?

394
00:38:30,504 --> 00:38:33,464
- Are you guys, are you guys, fighting.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

395
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:35,996
Oh, my God, what is it even like?

396
00:38:41,554 --> 00:38:43,143
Your ears burning.

397
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:44,985
Captain on the bridge.

398
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:48,045
Mr. Chekhov.

399
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:52,085
You've been shadowing Mr. Scott, you are
familiar with Engineering systems of this ship?

400
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:53,928
- Affirmative, sir.
- Good.

401
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:58,067
You are my new chief,
go and put on a red shirt.

402
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:03,144
Aye, Captain.

403
00:39:06,852 --> 00:39:09,330
Re-tract all moorings, Mr. Sulu.

404
00:39:09,368 --> 00:39:11,146
Yes, sir.

405
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:32,643
- Lieutenant Uhura, open a ship
wide channel. - Yes, sir.

406
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:34,585
Mr. Chekhov, how are
we looking down there?

407
00:39:34,611 --> 00:39:36,831
- All systems nominal, Captain.
- Copy that.

408
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,927
- Warp available at your command.
- Thank you, Mr. Chekhov.

409
00:39:40,603 --> 00:39:42,908
- All right, let's ride.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,131
Channel open, sir.

411
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,992
Attention, the crew of the Enterprise.

412
00:40:01,328 --> 00:40:05,300
As most of you know, Christopher Pike
former Captain of this ship,

413
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:07,316
and our friend,

414
00:40:08,404 --> 00:40:10,111
is dead.

415
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,120
The man who killed him has fled our system,
and hiding in the Klingon home-world.

416
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,939
Somewhere he believes
we are unwilling to go.

417
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:19,988
<i>We are on our
way there now.</i>

418
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:24,431
<i>For admiral Marcus it is essential
that our presence go undetected.</i>

419
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:28,279
<i>Tensions between the Federation
and the Klingon Empire have been high,</i>

420
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,005
<i>any provocation could
lead to all out war.</i>

421
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:45,926
I will personally lead
a landing party,

422
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:48,709
to abandoned city
on the surface of Kronos.

423
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,659
There we will capture
the fugitive John Harrison,

424
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:57,012
and return him to Earth so he can
face judgement for his actions.

425
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:03,655
All right, let's go get this
son of the bitch! Kirk out.

426
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,455
Captain, I believe you
made a right decision.

427
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:15,304
If I can be assistance, I would be happy
to accompanied you to your away team.

428
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:18,047
You happy?

429
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:21,262
I was simply attempting to
use your way to convey an idea.

430
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:24,613
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

431
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:47,475
Spock, you startled me.

432
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:51,400
- What are you doing, doctor?
- Verifying the torpedoes and...

433
00:41:51,404 --> 00:41:53,658
You misunderstand. What are you
doing on board this ship?

434
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:56,978
There is no record of you
being signed to the Enterprise.

435
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,688
- Really, that must be some sort of mistake.
- My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus.

436
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:04,475
Except that you have lied
about your identity.

437
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:06,676
Wallace is the sir name
of your mother.

438
00:42:07,052 --> 00:42:09,974
I can only assume that,
admiral is your father.

439
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:14,197
Mr. Spock.

440
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,233
I am aware that I have no right
to ask this of you...

441
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:20,785
But please...
He cannot know that I'm here.

442
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:30,554
Engineering manually
dropped out of warp, sir.

443
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:34,189
- Mr. Chekhov, did you brake my ship?
- Sorry, sir I do not know what happened.

444
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:36,927
The core overheated.
I had to activate the emergency stop.

445
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:39,139
It must be a cooling leak,
I need time to find it.

446
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:40,929
- Sorry, Captain.
- Dammit.

447
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:44,700
- Mr. Sulu, time down to our destination.
- 20 minutes, sir.

448
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,235
It's 20 minutes in enemy space
that we weren't counting on.

449
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,001
We better hop to it.

450
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:50,810
- Where is Spock?
- Here, Captain.

451
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,851
You coming with me to Kronos.

452
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:55,357
- Lieutenant, how is your Klingon?
- It's rusty but it's good.

453
00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:56,964
Good, you are coming too.

454
00:42:56,999 --> 00:42:59,648
Is this giving me any problems,
is it, you two working together?

455
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,360
Absolutely not.

456
00:43:03,866 --> 00:43:05,572
Unclear.

457
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:07,992
I'll meet you
in shuttle bay.

458
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,640
Jim, you are not actually
going down there, are you?

459
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:13,947
You don't rob a bank, when
a getaway car has a flat tire.

460
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,765
I'm sure engineering will have us all
patched up, by the time we get back.

461
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,291
- Is that right, Mr. Chekov?
- Yes, Captain.

462
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,435
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

463
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,689
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.

464
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,143
Once we are on route, I want you to transmit
a targeted comm-burst to Harrison's location.

465
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,965
Tell him you have bunch of real
big torpedoes pointed at his head,

466
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,178
if he doesn't play nice
we are not afraid to use it.

467
00:43:36,987 --> 00:43:38,867
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

468
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,764
But I have never sat
on that chair before.

469
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:43,722
You going to do great.

470
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:46,601
Jim, wait.

471
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,400
You just sat that man down
on high stakes poker game,

472
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,518
with no cards
and told him to bluff.

473
00:43:51,657 --> 00:43:53,880
Now, Sulu is a good man,
but he is no Captain.

474
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:57,320
For next 2 hours he is, and enough with
the metaphors, all-right. That's an order.

475
00:43:57,362 --> 00:44:00,376
Mr. Sulu, make sure that
the knormian ship is ready to fly.

476
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:11,863
Acting Captain Sulu
to shuttle-bay 2.

477
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:15,645
<i>Please have the trade ship we confiscated
during march-man incident last month.</i>

478
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,717
<i>Fuelled and flight ready. Captain Kirk
is on route to you right now.</i>

479
00:44:22,669 --> 00:44:25,679
- Ready to Deploy, Captain.
- Lieutenants loose the red shirts.

480
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,980
- You are knormien arms
dealers, put those on. - Sir?

481
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,153
For this thing goes south, there
can be nothing, tying us to starfeet.

482
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:35,200
Unless of course you want to
start a war, Mr. Hendor.

483
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:36,769
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

484
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,570
Good, me neither.

485
00:44:55,422 --> 00:44:58,500
I'm detecting a single life sign
in Keth province.

486
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:00,579
Given the information
provided by Mr. Scott,

487
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,695
this is most likely
John Harrison.

488
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,700
Mr. Sulu, I think we found our man
you let him know you mean business.

489
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:07,173
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

490
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:10,378
Attention, John Harrison.

491
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:14,248
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu
of the USS Enterprise.

492
00:45:14,685 --> 00:45:18,143
A shuttle of highly trained officers
is on it's way to your location.

493
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:21,528
If you do not surrender
to them immediately,

494
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:25,667
I will launch entire payload of
advanced long range torpedoes,

495
00:45:26,145 --> 00:45:28,206
currently locked on
to your location.

496
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:31,165
You have two minutes
to confirm your compliance.

497
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:35,195
Refusal do so will result
in your obliteration.

498
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,080
If you test me,
you will fail.

499
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,975
Mr. Sulu.

500
00:45:46,183 --> 00:45:48,400
Remind me never
to piss you off.

501
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:53,148
KRONOS

502
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,468
We arrive at Harrison's location
in three minutes, Captain.

503
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,589
It's unlikely that he
will come willingly.

504
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,328
I calculate the odds him to
attempting to kill us 91.6%.

505
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:05,416
- Fantastic.
- Good thing you don't care about dying.

506
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:09,414
I'm sorry, Lieutenant
I couldn't hear what you...

507
00:46:09,425 --> 00:46:11,284
Oh, I didn't say anything.

508
00:46:12,756 --> 00:46:14,902
Actually I'll be happy to speak
if you are willing listen to me.

509
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:16,902
- Guys.
- I'd prefer discuss this in private.

510
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:18,700
You'd prefer not to
discuss this at all.

511
00:46:18,701 --> 00:46:20,708
- Our plans...
- Are you really going to this now?

512
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:22,519
You never seems to require
my attent...

513
00:46:22,525 --> 00:46:24,340
- Miss Uhura...
- I'm sorry, Captain just two seconds.

514
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:27,770
Okay. It's us. At that volcano you
didn't give a thought to us.

515
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:30,361
What would it do to
me if you died, Spock.

516
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,218
You didn't feel anything.

517
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:35,120
You didn't care.

518
00:46:35,518 --> 00:46:38,500
And not I'm  the only-one whos is upset
with you, the Captain is too.

519
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:40,872
No, no, don't drag me into this.

520
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:46,754
She's right. Your suggestion that
I do not care about dying is incorrect.

521
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:50,948
Te sensitive beings optimal chance
to maximizing utility is long and prospers life.

522
00:46:50,951 --> 00:46:53,659
- Great.
- Not exactly a love-song, Spock.

523
00:46:53,662 --> 00:46:55,563
You misunderstand.

524
00:46:56,655 --> 00:47:01,189
It is true I chose not to feel anything
upon realizing that my own life was ending.

525
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:05,669
As admiral Pike was dying
I join in with his conscience,

526
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,252
and experienced what he felt
at the moment of his passing.

527
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:13,884
Anger, confusion, loneliness.

528
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,420
Fear.

529
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,720
I had experienced
those feelings before,

530
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:24,188
multiplied exponentially on the day
my planet was destroyed.

531
00:47:26,272 --> 00:47:30,194
Such a feeling is something
I choose never to experience again.

532
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,311
Nyota, you mistake
my choice not to feel,

533
00:47:36,891 --> 00:47:39,238
as a reflection
of me not caring.

534
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,767
While I assure you, the truth
is precisely the opposite.

535
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:51,820
What the hell was that?

536
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,475
What happen?
Where is the signal?

537
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,340
They are cut out,
I'm working on get them back.

538
00:47:59,062 --> 00:48:01,744
We are pursued by
a D-4 class Klingon vessel.

539
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,369
- I thought this sector was abandoned.
- Is must be a random patrol.

540
00:48:04,404 --> 00:48:05,875
Hold on.

541
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:10,808
This ship has no
offensive capabilities.

542
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:13,821
- She got us, give me all six fuel cells.
- Aye, Captain.

543
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,452
Dammit!

544
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,537
They are closing fast.
bearing 2-8-5.

545
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:38,087
Right there! There,
we can loose them there.

546
00:48:39,254 --> 00:48:42,175
If you are suggesting we utilize passage
between approaching structures,

547
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,618
- the ship will not fit.
- Will fit.

548
00:48:43,645 --> 00:48:46,266
- Captain, we will not fit.
- Will fit, Will fit!

549
00:49:04,744 --> 00:49:07,500
- I told we fit.
- I'm not sure that qualifies.

550
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:13,475
- Any sign of them?
- No, which worries me.

551
00:49:13,594 --> 00:49:15,514
- We lost them.
- Or they are jamming our scanners.

552
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,041
Or we lost them.

553
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:36,900
They are ordering us to land.

554
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:41,239
Captain, they are going want
to know why we are here.

555
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:44,525
And they are going to
torture us, question us,

556
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,988
and they are going to kill us.

557
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:51,309
So, we come out shooting.

558
00:49:54,235 --> 00:49:56,208
We are outnumbered,
out-gunned.

559
00:49:57,075 --> 00:49:59,287
There is no way we survive
if we attack first.

560
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,908
You have me here
because I speak Klingon.

561
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:07,104
Then let me speak Klingon.

562
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,049
This is not going to work.

563
00:50:57,108 --> 00:50:58,879
It is our only
logical option.

564
00:50:59,016 --> 00:51:02,275
And if you interrupt her now you
will not only wrath of the Klingons,

565
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,275
but that of Lieutenant Uhura as well.

566
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,727
I'm here to help you.

567
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,681
- Lieutenant.
- Thanks, Captain.

568
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:48,782
With full respect.

569
00:51:48,945 --> 00:51:53,523
A terrorist is hiding here
in the ruins.

570
00:51:53,564 --> 00:51:56,440
He has killed many of our people.

571
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,041
Why should I be interested
into a human who kills humans?

572
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:17,142
Because you believe in honor.

573
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:21,200
This man doesn't have honor.

574
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:24,730
You and your people
are in danger.

575
00:54:43,952 --> 00:54:45,730
- Stand down!
- How many torpedoes?

576
00:54:45,736 --> 00:54:47,186
Stand down!

577
00:54:47,439 --> 00:54:51,386
The torpedoes! The weapons you threaten
with me in your message. How many are they?

578
00:54:54,004 --> 00:54:55,419
72.

579
00:55:01,896 --> 00:55:03,557
I surrender.

580
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:21,700
On the behalf of
Christopher Pike,

581
00:55:22,424 --> 00:55:23,794
my friend,

582
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,955
I accept your surrender.

583
00:55:50,408 --> 00:55:51,964
Captain!

584
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,133
Captain.

585
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:15,168
Cuff him.

586
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:37,246
- Bones, meet me at the brig.
- I'll be right there.

587
00:56:37,944 --> 00:56:41,956
Lieutenant, contact starfleet. Let them know
that we have Harrison in custody.

588
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:46,306
- And we will be on our way
once the warp core is repaired. - Yes, sir.

589
00:57:02,932 --> 00:57:04,696
Why the hell did he surrender?

590
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:08,308
I don't know. He just took out squadron
of Klingons single handedly. I want to know how.

591
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,396
Sounds like we have
a Superman on-board.

592
00:57:10,915 --> 00:57:12,630
You tell me.

593
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:23,420
Put your arm through that hole.
I'm going to take a blood sample.

594
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,806
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

595
00:57:41,205 --> 00:57:44,545
An unexpected malfunction
perhaps in your warp core,

596
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:47,500
immediately stranding you on
the edge of the Klingon space.

597
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,081
- How the hell do you know that?
- Bones.

598
00:57:50,101 --> 00:57:53,838
I think you would find my
insight valuable, Captain.

599
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:57,740
Are we good?

600
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,644
Let me know
what you can find.

601
00:58:00,823 --> 00:58:04,458
Ignore me, and you will get
everyone on this ship killed.

602
00:58:10,911 --> 00:58:13,991
Captain, I believe he will only
attempt to manipulate you.

603
00:58:14,192 --> 00:58:16,751
I would not recommending
engaging prisoner further.

604
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,374
Give me a minute.

605
00:58:30,756 --> 00:58:32,800
Let me explain what
is happening here.

606
00:58:33,494 --> 00:58:34,949
You're a criminal.

607
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:38,123
I watched you murder
innocent men and women,

608
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:40,250
I was authorized to end you.

609
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,660
And the only reason
why you are still alive

610
00:58:43,675 --> 00:58:46,051
is because
I am allowing it.

611
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:48,520
So shut your mouth.

612
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,913
Captain, are you're going to
punch me again over and over,

613
00:58:52,923 --> 00:58:54,800
till your arm weakens?

614
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:57,055
Clearly you want to?
So, tell me,

615
00:58:58,412 --> 00:59:01,702
- Why did you allow me to live?
- We all make mistakes.

616
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,122
No.

617
00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:07,159
I surrender to you because, despite
your attempt to convince me otherwise,

618
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,113
you seems to have
a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

619
00:59:11,425 --> 00:59:15,976
If you did not, it would be impossible
me to convince you of the truth.

620
00:59:16,906 --> 00:59:18,024
2, 3,

621
00:59:18,026 --> 00:59:19,113
1, 7,

622
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:20,380
4, 6,

623
00:59:20,502 --> 00:59:21,764
1, 1.

624
00:59:22,636 --> 00:59:24,895
Coordinates not
far from Earth.

625
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:27,954
If you want to know
why I did, what I did

626
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:30,505
go and take a look.

627
00:59:30,865 --> 00:59:33,120
Give me one reason
why I should listen you.

628
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,900
I can give you 72.

629
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:38,370
And they are on-board
your ship, Captain.

630
00:59:39,601 --> 00:59:41,810
They have been all long.

631
00:59:42,484 --> 00:59:45,003
I suggest you open one up.

632
01:00:10,594 --> 01:00:12,400
You know what really
bothers me, thou?

633
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:15,899
It's the modifications,
you know the enhancements.

634
01:00:16,254 --> 01:00:18,355
Right, and like that
I'm off the ship.

635
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,699
Just trying to do
what's right.

636
01:00:21,947 --> 01:00:25,121
And what did you do anyway? You just
stood there like an oyster, looking at me.

637
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,186
- What?
- Scotty, it's Kirk.

638
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,700
Oh, well now.

639
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,559
If is it Captain James
Tiberius perfect hair.

640
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:35,196
<i>Did you hear that,
I called him perfect hair?</i>

641
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,084
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

642
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,440
Are you drunk?

643
01:00:38,464 --> 01:00:40,876
What I do in my private time
is my business, Jimbo.

644
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,902
I need your help me
with something.

645
01:00:42,933 --> 01:00:47,291
Will you take these coordinates
down 23, 17, 46, 11.

646
01:00:48,556 --> 01:00:50,936
- Are you writing? - What, you think
I do not remember 4 numbers?

647
01:00:52,073 --> 01:00:53,728
You have little faith.

648
01:00:54,342 --> 01:00:56,901
- What was the third one?
- 46.

649
01:00:57,837 --> 01:00:59,896
Don't know exactly what
you are looking for but...

650
01:01:00,305 --> 01:01:03,008
I have feeling you
know when you see it.

651
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,747
May been right
about those torpedoes.

652
01:01:08,057 --> 01:01:12,373
I will consider that an apology,
and I will consider that apology.

653
01:01:13,672 --> 01:01:15,969
- You are the one who quit.
- You make me quit!

654
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,646
Mr. Scott! Scott!

655
01:01:21,913 --> 01:01:23,602
Enough with that guy.

656
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,350
I'm not doing that
man any favors.

657
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:29,509
No!

658
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:31,400
All-right then.

659
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:33,401
Are you out of corn-fed mind?

660
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,603
You're actually not going
to listen this guy?

661
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:37,589
He killed Pike,
he almost killed you,

662
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,200
And now think it's a good idea to pop open
a torpedo because he dare you to do it?

663
01:01:41,205 --> 01:01:42,966
Why did he saved
our life's, Bones?

664
01:01:43,206 --> 01:01:44,902
The doctor does have
a point, Captain.

665
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,531
Don't agree with me, Spock,
it's make me very uncomfortable.

666
01:01:47,532 --> 01:01:50,140
Perhaps you two should learn
governing yours emotions, doctor.

667
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:53,001
- In this situation, logic dictates...
- Logic! My God!

668
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:56,317
There is a maniac trying to make us
blowing up our damn ship, and you all talking about...

669
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,578
I don't know why he
surrendered but that's not it.

670
01:01:58,917 --> 01:02:01,178
So, if we are going to open
a torpedo the question is how?

671
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,245
But Jim, without Mr. Scott on board
who's exactly qualified

672
01:02:04,246 --> 01:02:06,720
to just pop-up a four ton
stick of dynamite?

673
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:10,400
Admiral's daughter appear to be have interest
in torpedoes and she is a weapon specialist.

674
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,650
Perhaps she could
be some use.

675
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:16,092
- What admiral's daughter?
- Carol Marcus.

676
01:02:16,204 --> 01:02:19,552
Your new science officer concealed
her identity to board the ship.

677
01:02:19,853 --> 01:02:23,680
- And when were you going to tell me that?
- When it became relevant, as it just did.

678
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:27,430
- Are the torpedoes in the weapons-bay?
- Loaded and ready fire. What are they?

679
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:30,566
I do not know. So I transferred
to your ship to find out why.

680
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,302
I do apologize for that.

681
01:02:32,337 --> 01:02:34,935
By the way, if I cause you
any problems I'm sorry.

682
01:02:35,147 --> 01:02:37,395
- I'm Carol Marcus.
- James Kirk.

683
01:02:37,401 --> 01:02:39,079
Torpedoes.

684
01:02:39,335 --> 01:02:41,710
My father gave me access
to every programs, he had control.

685
01:02:41,726 --> 01:02:44,850
So when I heard he was developing
these prototype torpedoes

686
01:02:45,142 --> 01:02:48,144
when I went to confronting him
about it, he wouldn't even to see me.

687
01:02:48,892 --> 01:02:52,420
That's when I discovered that torpedoes
had disappeared from all the official records.

688
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,901
And then he
gave them to me.

689
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,948
You much clever than your
reputation suggest, Captain Kirk.

690
01:02:57,996 --> 01:03:01,290
- I have reputation? - Yes you do,
I'm friend of Christine Chapels.

691
01:03:02,453 --> 01:03:05,369
- Christine, yes. How is she?
- She transferred to frontier to be a nurse.

692
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:08,077
- She's much happier now.
- That's good.

693
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,730
You have no idea who
I'm talking about, do you?

694
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,689
- What are we doing in here? - Is this shuttle
prepared to fly? - Of course it is.

695
01:03:14,695 --> 01:03:16,673
- Would you please turn around.
- Why?

696
01:03:17,615 --> 01:03:19,239
Just turn around.

697
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:24,101
It's too dangerous to try open one
of these a torpedoes on the Enterprise.

698
01:03:24,108 --> 01:03:28,320
But there is a nearby planetoid,
I can open up one there.

699
01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:30,285
But I will need some help...

700
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:32,779
Turn around.

701
01:03:33,705 --> 01:03:35,068
Now!

702
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:38,011
Captain on the bridge.

703
01:03:38,513 --> 01:03:42,645
Mr. Sulu, Dr. Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid, yet?

704
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:45,205
Yes, sir. They are moving
the torpedo into the position now.

705
01:03:45,496 --> 01:03:47,398
Good, any activity
from the Klingons?

706
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:51,155
Not yet, but if we are stuck here
much longer they will find us.

707
01:03:51,925 --> 01:03:55,076
Lieutenant Uhura, did you let starfleet know
that we have Harrison in custody?

708
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,190
Yes, sir.
No response.

709
01:03:57,195 --> 01:03:59,561
<i>Engineering to bridge.
Hello, Captain, can you hear me?</i>

710
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,465
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.

711
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:05,265
We found the leak, sir,
but damage is substantial.

712
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,400
- We are working on it.
- Any idea what caused it?

713
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:11,957
No, sir but I except
full responsibility.

714
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,810
Something tells me that
it wasn't your fault.

715
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,870
- Stay on it.
- Shuttle is standing by, Captain.

716
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:23,838
Bones, thanks for helping out, Dr. Marcus
asked for steadiest hands on the ship.

717
01:04:24,874 --> 01:04:28,068
You know, when I dreamed about being stuck
on a deserted planet with a gorgeous woman,

718
01:04:28,129 --> 01:04:29,687
there was no torpedo.

719
01:04:29,738 --> 01:04:32,189
Dr. McCoy, may I remember you
that you're not there to flirt.

720
01:04:32,195 --> 01:04:35,901
- So, how can these legendary
hands help you Dr. Marcus? - Bones.

721
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,130
To understand how powerful these
weapons are we need to open the warhead.

722
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:44,465
To do that, we need to access the fuel compartment.
Unfortunately for us, warhead's on these weapons are live.

723
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:47,936
Sweetheart, I once performed
an emergency c-section on a pregnant Gorn.

724
01:04:47,939 --> 01:04:51,085
Eight cubs, let me tell you
those little bastards bite.

725
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,200
I think I can work some
magic on your missile.

726
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:58,405
Dr. McCoy, there is a bundle
of fiber optic-cables against the inner casing.

727
01:04:58,665 --> 01:05:02,575
You need to cut the 23th wire down.
Whatever you do, do not touch anything else.

728
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,680
- Do you understand?
- Right. That thought never crossed my mind.

729
01:05:05,685 --> 01:05:07,863
Dr. McCoy, wait for my word.

730
01:05:08,854 --> 01:05:10,862
<i>I'm re-routing detonation processor.</i>

731
01:05:11,506 --> 01:05:13,084
- Are you ready?
- Born and ready.

732
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,167
Good luck!

733
01:05:15,689 --> 01:05:18,500
- Sir, torpedo just armed itself.
- The warhead is going to detonate in 30 seconds.

734
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:21,345
What the hell happened?
I can get my arm out.

735
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,215
Aim their signal!
Beam them back right now?

736
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,450
Transporter can not difference
between Dr. McCoy and torpedo.

737
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:28,590
We can not beam back
one without the other.

738
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,015
- Dr. Marcus can you disarm it?
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

739
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:37,547
- Jim get her hell out of here. - No, if you
beam me back, he dies. Just let me do it.

740
01:05:37,857 --> 01:05:40,600
10, 9, 8...

741
01:05:40,758 --> 01:05:43,480
Standing by to transport
Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.

742
01:05:44,084 --> 01:05:45,705
4, 3...

743
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:47,453
Shit!

744
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,001
De-activation successful, Captain.

745
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:57,755
Dr. McCoy, you all-right?

746
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,949
Bones.

747
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,066
Jim?

748
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:08,812
You gonna
want to see this.

749
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:22,200
Coordinates 23.17.46.11
Jupiter

750
01:07:15,338 --> 01:07:18,432
<i>... loading dock 12.</i>

751
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:23,388
<i>USS Vengeance bridge crew requesting
entry to the construction hangar.</i>

752
01:07:25,299 --> 01:07:27,632
<i>You are clear enter the hangar.</i>

753
01:07:35,748 --> 01:07:39,427
<i>I need a welding-team
on number one cell.</i>

754
01:07:42,713 --> 01:07:44,411
Holy shi...

755
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:48,189
- What do we got?
- It's quite clever actually.

756
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,522
This fuel container has removed from torpedo
and retro fitted to, hide this Cryo-tube.

757
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,154
- Is he alive?
- He is alive.

758
01:07:57,637 --> 01:08:01,132
But if you try revive him without
the proper sequence, could kill him.

759
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:03,548
This technology is beyond me.

760
01:08:03,892 --> 01:08:06,218
- How advanced, Doctor?
- It's not advanced.

761
01:08:06,676 --> 01:08:08,407
That Cryo-tube is ancient.

762
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:11,359
We have not needed to freeze anyone,
since we develop warp capability.

763
01:08:11,364 --> 01:08:14,520
Which explains the most interesting
thing about of our friend here.

764
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,487
He is 300 years old.

765
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:28,010
Why there is a man
in that torpedo?

766
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:33,504
There are men and women in all those
torpedoes, Captain. I put them there.

767
01:08:36,954 --> 01:08:38,652
Who the hell are you?

768
01:08:42,398 --> 01:08:44,600
"A remnant of the time long past."

769
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:51,017
Genetically engineered to be superior, as
to lead others to peace in a world at war.

770
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:56,755
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced in to exile.

771
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,154
For centuries we slept.

772
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:04,574
Hoping when we woke,
things would be different.

773
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,400
And as result of
the destruction of Vulcan,

774
01:09:07,638 --> 01:09:11,245
your starfleet began to aggressively
search system quadrants of space.

775
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:14,081
My ship was found in-drift,
I alone was revived.

776
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:17,775
I looked up John Harrison.
Until a year ago he did not exist.

777
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:21,950
John Harrison was fiction created the moment
I was awoken by your admiral Marcus,

778
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:24,287
as to help him in
advance his cause.

779
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,883
A smoke screen to conceal
my true identity.

780
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:32,642
My name is Khan.

781
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:40,450
Why would a starfleet admiral

782
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:44,390
ask a 300 year old
frozen man for help?

783
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,313
Because, I'm better.

784
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,408
- At what?
- Everything.

785
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,366
Alexander Marcus needed to respond
to uncivilized threats in civilized times.

786
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:57,363
For that he needed
a warriors mind.

787
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,407
My mind,

788
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,752
to design
weapons and warships.

789
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,630
You are suggesting the admiral violated
every regulation he vow to uphold,

790
01:10:05,636 --> 01:10:07,995
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

791
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,706
To exploit my savagery.

792
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:13,105
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

793
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:17,270
You, you can not even break a rule
how would you be excepted to break bone?

794
01:10:18,704 --> 01:10:20,760
Marcus used me
to design weapons.

795
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:24,256
To help him realize
his vision of militarized starfleet.

796
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,870
He sent you to
use those weapons

797
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,166
to fire my torpedoes on
an unsuspecting planet.

798
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,730
And then he purposely crippled
your ship in enemy space,

799
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,320
leading in one
inevitable outcome.

800
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:42,000
The Klingons would come searching
for whom ever was responsible,

801
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:44,366
and you have had
not chance of escape.

802
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,860
Marcus...

803
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,740
would finally have the war he talked
about the war, he always wanted.

804
01:10:51,578 --> 01:10:53,300
No. No.

805
01:10:54,343 --> 01:10:58,300
I watched you open fire in a room full of
unarmed starfleet officers.

806
01:10:58,604 --> 01:11:00,350
You killed in cold blood!

807
01:11:00,355 --> 01:11:02,725
Marcus took my crew from me.

808
01:11:02,727 --> 01:11:07,400
- You're a murderer!
- He used my friends to control me.

809
01:11:12,038 --> 01:11:14,608
I tried to smuggling
them to safety

810
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:17,500
by concealing them in
the very weapons I had designed.

811
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,655
But I was discovered,

812
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:26,214
I had no choice,
but to escape alone.

813
01:11:28,309 --> 01:11:32,470
And when I did, I had
every reason to suspect,

814
01:11:32,475 --> 01:11:36,630
that Marcus had killed
every single one

815
01:11:36,635 --> 01:11:39,721
of the people
I hold most dear.

816
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:46,511
So, I respond it in unkind.

817
01:11:51,226 --> 01:11:52,713
My crew...

818
01:11:52,882 --> 01:11:55,200
is my family, Kirk.

819
01:11:55,953 --> 01:11:59,341
Is there anything you would
not do for your family?

820
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,954
<i>Proximity alert, sir. There is a ship
at warp heading right for us.</i>

821
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,664
- Klingons?
- At warp?

822
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,776
No, Kirk.
We both know who it is.

823
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,365
<i>I don't think so, it's not
coming at us from Kronos.</i>

824
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,368
- Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay, post six
security officers on him. - Yes, Captain.

825
01:12:21,782 --> 01:12:22,885
Captain on the bridge.

826
01:12:24,234 --> 01:12:26,681
- ETA on incoming ship?
- Three seconds, sir.

827
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:31,004
- Shields.
- Aye, Captain.

828
01:12:55,465 --> 01:12:57,472
They are hailing us, sir.

829
01:12:57,662 --> 01:12:59,443
On screen.

830
01:12:59,994 --> 01:13:02,680
Broadcast ship wide
for the record.

831
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:07,947
Captain Kirk.

832
01:13:09,191 --> 01:13:11,978
Admiral Marcus,
I wasn't excepting you.

833
01:13:12,464 --> 01:13:14,505
Hell of a ship you got there.

834
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:17,582
I wasn't expecting to get word
of that you taking Harrison to custody,

835
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:19,533
in violation of your orders.

836
01:13:20,045 --> 01:13:22,762
Well, we have to improvise when,

837
01:13:22,763 --> 01:13:25,578
our warp core unexpected
malfunction.

838
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:29,084
- But you already know that, sir.
- I don't take your meaning.

839
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:32,913
Oh, that's why you are here isn't?
To assist with our repairs.

840
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:36,309
Why else would the head of
starfleet personally come to,

841
01:13:36,313 --> 01:13:38,384
the edge of the neutral zone?

842
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:42,826
- Captain, they are scanning our ship.
- Is there something I could find, sir?

843
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:45,510
Where is your prisoner Kirk?

844
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,064
Per starfleet regulation, I'm planning
on returning Khan to Earth

845
01:13:50,074 --> 01:13:51,751
to stand trial.

846
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:54,114
Well, shit.

847
01:13:55,122 --> 01:13:57,188
You talked to him.

848
01:13:58,062 --> 01:14:00,564
Exactly what I wanted
to spare you from.

849
01:14:00,654 --> 01:14:03,590
I took a tactical risk and
I woke that bastard up.

850
01:14:03,633 --> 01:14:06,959
Believing that his superior intelligence
could help us protect ourselves,

851
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,538
from whatever
came after us next.

852
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:12,088
But, I made a mistake.

853
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:15,654
And now the blood of
everybody's kill is on my hands.

854
01:14:15,867 --> 01:14:18,253
So, I'm asking you,

855
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,007
Give him to me,

856
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:23,219
so, I can end what I started.

857
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:30,038
And what exactly would you like
me to do with the rest of his crew, sir?

858
01:14:31,294 --> 01:14:34,991
Fire at them to the Klingons
and end 72 lives?

859
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:36,708
To start a war in process?

860
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:39,856
He put those people in those torpedoes.

861
01:14:39,857 --> 01:14:43,336
I didn't simply wanted burden you
with knowing what's inside of them.

862
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,292
You saw what this
man can do all by himself.

863
01:14:45,293 --> 01:14:49,190
Can you imagine what would happen
if we woke up rest of his crew?

864
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:52,788
What else did he tell you,
that he is a peace keeper?

865
01:14:52,813 --> 01:14:55,703
He is playing you, son.
Don't you see that?

866
01:14:55,828 --> 01:14:59,781
Khan and his crew were condemned
to death as a war criminals.

867
01:14:59,881 --> 01:15:01,954
And now it is our duty
to carry out that sentence

868
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,905
before anybody else dies
because of him.

869
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:09,337
I'm going to ask you again.

870
01:15:10,009 --> 01:15:12,483
One last time, son.

871
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,814
Lower your shields.
Tell me where he is.

872
01:15:20,739 --> 01:15:23,001
He is in Engineering, sir.

873
01:15:24,631 --> 01:15:28,103
But I have him moved to
the transporter room right away.

874
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,480
I'll take it from here.

875
01:15:30,895 --> 01:15:33,188
- Do not drop those shields, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, Captain.

876
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:35,555
Captain given your wearness
Khan's true locations in med bay,

877
01:15:35,556 --> 01:15:37,609
may I know the details
of your plan?

878
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:40,409
I told Marcus we will bring
a fugitive back to Earth,

879
01:15:40,423 --> 01:15:42,123
that is what
we going to do.

880
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,948
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?

881
01:15:43,949 --> 01:15:48,691
Sir, if we go to warp, we runs
a risk of seriously damaging the core.

882
01:15:48,692 --> 01:15:50,517
Can we do it?

883
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:54,774
Technically yes,
but I would not advise it, Captain.

884
01:15:54,856 --> 01:15:56,456
Noted.

885
01:15:57,182 --> 01:16:00,234
- Mr. Sulu, set a course for Earth.
- Yes, sir.

886
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,917
Pparte'.

887
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:12,161
Well, at least we are moving again.

888
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:16,993
If you think,
you are safe at warp,

889
01:16:17,334 --> 01:16:19,236
you are wrong.

890
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:23,923
Lieutenant Uhura, contact starfleet.

891
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:27,050
Tell them we are pursued into the neutral-
zone by unmarked Federation ship.

892
01:16:27,056 --> 01:16:28,981
Comms are down, sir.

893
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,027
- Permission to coming on the bridge.
- Dr. Marcus.

894
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:36,741
He is going to catch us and when he does the
only thing that's going to stop his ship is me.

895
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,700
- So you must let me talk to him.
- Carol, we are warp.

896
01:16:38,705 --> 01:16:40,556
- He can't catch up with us.
- Yes, he can.

897
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,909
The ship has advanced
warp capabilities.

898
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:45,283
Captain, I'm getting a reading
I don't understand.

899
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,423
- Where are we?
- 237,000 Km from Earth.

900
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:19,227
- Damage report.
- Weapons are not working.

901
01:17:19,255 --> 01:17:21,163
We have a bulk head-breach.

902
01:17:21,274 --> 01:17:23,431
- Where is the damages?
- Major hull damage, Captain.

903
01:17:28,867 --> 01:17:31,420
Evasive maneuvers,
get us to the Earth, right now!

904
01:17:31,425 --> 01:17:34,244
Stop! Everybody on
this ship is going to die,

905
01:17:34,247 --> 01:17:36,306
if you don't let
me speak to him.

906
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,273
Uhura, hail them.

907
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:43,006
Sir, it's me, it's Carol.

908
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:55,213
What are you doing on that ship?

909
01:17:55,513 --> 01:17:57,381
I heard what you said.

910
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:02,425
That you made a mistake and now
you are doing every thing you can to fix-it.

911
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:05,440
But, Dad...

912
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:13,000
I don't believe that, the man who
raised me is capable,

913
01:18:14,104 --> 01:18:16,740
of destroying a ship
full of innocent of people.

914
01:18:17,023 --> 01:18:18,402
<i>And...</i>

915
01:18:18,603 --> 01:18:22,387
If I'm wrong about that, then you going
to have to do it with me on board.

916
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:27,597
Actually Carol, I won't.

917
01:18:31,112 --> 01:18:33,737
- Jim.
- Can we intercept the transport signal?

918
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,203
No, sir.

919
01:18:36,705 --> 01:18:38,036
Carol!

920
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:42,533
Captain Kirk without authorization, in league
with the fugitive John Harrison,

921
01:18:42,538 --> 01:18:44,693
you went rogue in
enemy territory.

922
01:18:44,894 --> 01:18:48,016
Leaving me choice, but hunt
you down and destroy you.

923
01:18:48,398 --> 01:18:50,382
- Lock phasers.
- Wait, wait, wait!

924
01:18:50,453 --> 01:18:54,000
I make this quick, target all out door
torpedoes on the Enterprise bridge.

925
01:18:54,002 --> 01:18:56,459
Sir, my crew was just,
just following my orders.

926
01:18:56,555 --> 01:18:59,127
I take, I take full responsibility
for my actions,

927
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:01,758
but they were mine,
and they were mine alone.

928
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:06,177
If I transmit Khan's location to you now,
all that I ask is that you spare them.

929
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,141
Please, sir.

930
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,575
I'll do anything you want.

931
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,932
Just let them live.

932
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:26,609
That's a hell of an apology,

933
01:19:26,822 --> 01:19:28,893
but if it is any conciliation...

934
01:19:29,088 --> 01:19:31,788
I was never going
to spare your crew.

935
01:19:32,954 --> 01:19:34,675
Fire at will.

936
01:19:55,027 --> 01:19:56,767
I'm sorry.

937
01:20:00,168 --> 01:20:02,508
- Weapons aren't firing. - There is
a problem down here. Energy going down!

938
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:04,991
Someone in engineering just
manually reset our systems.

939
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,247
What do you mean,
someone! Who?

940
01:20:07,447 --> 01:20:09,922
Their weapons
are powered down, sir.

941
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:12,322
<i>Enterprise, can you hear me?</i>

942
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:14,149
Scotty!

943
01:20:15,784 --> 01:20:18,800
- Guess what I found behind Jupiter?
- You are on that ship!

944
01:20:18,807 --> 01:20:22,060
I sneak on it, seems that I just committed
an act of treason against a starfleet admiral

945
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:25,251
and I really like to get off
this bloody ship. Now beam me out!

946
01:20:25,398 --> 01:20:29,357
You're miracle worker, we are little low
on power right now. Just standby, standby!

947
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,332
What do you mean low on power?
What happened to the Enterprise?

948
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,467
I call you back.

949
01:20:35,468 --> 01:20:36,768
Scotty!

950
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,115
Spock, our ship,
how is she?

951
01:20:40,688 --> 01:20:44,678
Our options are limited, Captain.
We cannot fire and we can not flee.

952
01:20:47,124 --> 01:20:48,744
There is one option.

953
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:51,575
Uhura, when you get Scotty
back, patch him through.

954
01:20:51,589 --> 01:20:54,171
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Spock, you have the com.

955
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,777
Captain, I strongly object.

956
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,698
To what? I haven't
said anything yet.

957
01:21:01,755 --> 01:21:05,183
Since we cannot take the ship from the outside,
the only way we can take it is within.

958
01:21:05,187 --> 01:21:06,957
And as large boarding
party would be detected,

959
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:09,776
it is optimum for you take
few members of crew as possible.

960
01:21:09,964 --> 01:21:11,790
You will meet resistance,
requiring personal,

961
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:15,316
with advanced combat ability's
and big knowledge of that ship.

962
01:21:15,406 --> 01:21:17,912
This indicates that you
planned to align with Khan,

963
01:21:17,913 --> 01:21:19,708
the very man we were
sent here to destroy.

964
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:21,617
I'm not aligning with
him, I'm using him.

965
01:21:21,632 --> 01:21:23,852
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend my.

966
01:21:23,853 --> 01:21:27,790
An arabic proverb attributed to an prince
who was betrayed and decapitated by his own subjects.

967
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:29,785
Still, it's a hell of quote.

968
01:21:29,794 --> 01:21:31,752
- I will go with you, Captain.
- No, I need you on the bridge.

969
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,701
I can't allow you to do this.

970
01:21:33,737 --> 01:21:37,189
It's my function on this ship to advise
you making wisest decisions possible,

971
01:21:37,255 --> 01:21:39,761
something I firmly believe you
are incapable doing in this moment.

972
01:21:39,779 --> 01:21:41,549
You are right!

973
01:21:42,783 --> 01:21:47,729
What I am about to do doesn't make
any sense. It’s not logical, it is a gut feeling.

974
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:52,998
I have no idea what I suppose to do.

975
01:21:53,998 --> 01:21:56,413
I only know
what I can do.

976
01:21:57,204 --> 01:22:00,542
The Enterprise and her crew needs
someone in that chair who knows what he is doing.

977
01:22:05,098 --> 01:22:07,106
And it's not me.

978
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,871
It's you, Spock.

979
01:22:33,523 --> 01:22:35,805
Tell me everything you
know about that ship.

980
01:22:35,891 --> 01:22:40,219
Dreadnought class two times the size
three times the speed, advanced weaponry,

981
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:42,267
modified for minimal crew.

982
01:22:42,405 --> 01:22:45,637
Unlike most Federation vessels,
it is built solely for combat.

983
01:22:46,242 --> 01:22:49,344
I will do everything I can

984
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:52,078
to make you answer
for what you did.

985
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:01,323
- But right now I need your help.
- In exchange for what?

986
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,714
You said you would do
anything for your crew.

987
01:23:06,332 --> 01:23:09,179
- I can guarantee their safety.
- Captain.

988
01:23:10,432 --> 01:23:13,631
You cant even guarantee
safety of your own crew.

989
01:23:19,882 --> 01:23:21,742
Bones, what are you
doing with that tribble?

990
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:25,172
Tribble's dead, I'm
injecting Khan's platelets

991
01:23:25,174 --> 01:23:27,476
into the deceased
tissues of necrotic host.

992
01:23:28,233 --> 01:23:30,731
Khan's cells regenerate
like nothing I ever seen.

993
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,633
I want to know why.

994
01:23:38,038 --> 01:23:40,270
You coming with
me or not?

995
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,308
You want to do what?

996
01:23:44,316 --> 01:23:47,968
We are coming over there, Sulu is maneuvering
the Enterprise in position as we speak.

997
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,673
<i>To this ship? How?</i>

998
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,809
There is a cargo door,
hanger 7, access port 101A.

999
01:23:52,109 --> 01:23:54,348
You need to find a manual
override to open that airlock.

1000
01:23:54,352 --> 01:23:56,827
Are you crazy?
Whoever you are.

1001
01:23:56,925 --> 01:23:58,954
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's going to be all right.

1002
01:23:59,045 --> 01:24:02,384
It is not going to be all right. You want me
to open an airlock into space

1003
01:24:02,386 --> 01:24:04,868
where upon I will freeze,
die, and explode?

1004
01:24:04,912 --> 01:24:09,148
Lieutenant, from our current position is it
possible to establish contact with the new Vulcan.

1005
01:24:09,863 --> 01:24:12,494
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

1006
01:24:14,278 --> 01:24:16,390
Mr. Sulu, what is
the status of the other ship?

1007
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:20,086
Their systems are still off-line.
I'm aligning our ship now.

1008
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:58,516
- Scotty, how are we doing over there?
- Captain, I wish I had better news.

1009
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:01,033
They blocked our access
to the ship's computer.

1010
01:25:01,043 --> 01:25:04,010
They will have full weapons
in three minutes.

1011
01:25:04,013 --> 01:25:08,252
So next time I will not be able to stop
them destroying the Enterprise. Standby.

1012
01:25:08,352 --> 01:25:12,742
Commander, our trash chute is aimed at
access port 101A on the other ship.

1013
01:25:12,751 --> 01:25:15,600
- Captain the ships is aligned.
- Copy that.

1014
01:25:15,827 --> 01:25:19,297
- Scotty!
- I'm in the hangar, give me a minute.

1015
01:25:23,026 --> 01:25:25,182
I'm running, standby.

1016
01:25:35,495 --> 01:25:39,289
Whoa, whoa! I do not know, Captain.
This door is very vee, I mean small.

1017
01:25:39,383 --> 01:25:41,290
It's 4 square meters tops.

1018
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:43,958
It's going to be like, jumping
out of a moving car,

1019
01:25:44,001 --> 01:25:45,867
off a bridge
into a shot-glass.

1020
01:25:45,916 --> 01:25:48,362
It's okay.
I've done it before.

1021
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:52,839
Yeah, I was vertical
we jump down to a...

1022
01:25:54,096 --> 01:25:57,892
- It doesn't matter. Scotty! - Did you find
manual override? - The manual override, Scotty?

1023
01:25:57,906 --> 01:25:59,961
Not yet.
Not yet.

1024
01:26:05,797 --> 01:26:07,630
Captain, before you launch,
you should be aware,

1025
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:10,059
that there is a considerable
debris field between our ships.

1026
01:26:10,066 --> 01:26:11,733
Spock, not now.
Scotty, are you good?

1027
01:26:11,738 --> 01:26:15,607
It's not easy just, give me two
seconds all-right? You mad bastard!

1028
01:26:24,024 --> 01:26:26,263
Tell me this going to work.

1029
01:26:27,206 --> 01:26:30,441
I have neither the information
nor confidence to do so, Doctor.

1030
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,060
<i>Okay Captain. Standby.</i>

1031
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,844
You are real comfort.

1032
01:26:35,245 --> 01:26:36,845
Come on, come on!

1033
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,658
Yes! Okay, okay I've set
to open the door.

1034
01:26:40,324 --> 01:26:42,677
- You ready?
- Are you?

1035
01:26:46,021 --> 01:26:47,910
<i>Spock, pull the trigger.</i>

1036
01:26:48,678 --> 01:26:50,278
Yes, Captain.

1037
01:26:55,449 --> 01:26:58,284
Launching activation sequence on 3...

1038
01:26:58,504 --> 01:27:00,120
2...

1039
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:01,711
1...

1040
01:27:11,913 --> 01:27:14,697
Sir, Kirk is heading
for a collision at 0.32.

1041
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,928
- Captain, there is debris directly ahead.
- Copy that.

1042
01:27:21,496 --> 01:27:23,390
Wow, Jim you way off course.

1043
01:27:23,395 --> 01:27:25,367
I know, I know. I can see that.

1044
01:27:34,928 --> 01:27:36,774
Don't move.

1045
01:27:38,518 --> 01:27:42,737
Use the display compass, Captain.
You must correct precisely 37.243 degrees.

1046
01:27:42,739 --> 01:27:45,038
Got it! I'm working
my way back.

1047
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:49,998
Scotty, are you going to be
ready with that door, right?

1048
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,248
What are you doing here?

1049
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:56,200
Little bit of maintenance
on the airlock console. You're big.

1050
01:27:56,202 --> 01:27:57,425
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1051
01:27:57,428 --> 01:28:01,006
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.
I'm working on getting his signal back. Stand by!

1052
01:28:03,562 --> 01:28:05,546
- Damn it!
- Captain, what is it?

1053
01:28:05,684 --> 01:28:08,513
My helmet was hit. Uhura, tell
me that you have Mr. Scott back.

1054
01:28:08,514 --> 01:28:10,231
Not yet. I'm still working
on the signal.

1055
01:28:10,232 --> 01:28:12,848
<i>His communicator is working,
I don't know why he is not responding.</i>

1056
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:15,469
- What is that? - Are you starfleet
or private security?

1057
01:28:15,471 --> 01:28:17,688
- Show me your other hand.
- Because you look like private security.

1058
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,397
Impending collision detected.

1059
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,815
Khan use evasive action
there are debris directly ahead.

1060
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:23,606
I see it.

1061
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,327
Mr. Sulu did we loose Khan?

1062
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:34,011
I don't know, Commander, I'm having
trouble tracking him in all this debris.

1063
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,600
- Was Khan hit?
- We are trying to find him now.

1064
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:40,773
Captain, you need to adjust your target
destination 183 by 473 degrees.

1065
01:28:52,862 --> 01:28:55,081
Spock, my display
is dead, I'm flying blind.

1066
01:28:55,418 --> 01:28:56,962
Captain, without
your display compass,

1067
01:28:56,997 --> 01:28:59,429
hitting your target destination
is mathematical impossible.

1068
01:28:59,432 --> 01:29:02,153
Spock, if I get back, we really need
to talk about your bedside manner.

1069
01:29:02,154 --> 01:29:04,553
Commander, he is
not going to make it.

1070
01:29:09,637 --> 01:29:11,457
My display is still function.

1071
01:29:11,643 --> 01:29:14,567
I see you Kirk. You're 200 meters
ahead of me in mine one o'clock.

1072
01:29:14,576 --> 01:29:17,470
Cut to your left few
degrees and follow me.

1073
01:29:28,971 --> 01:29:31,500
Scotty, we're getting close,
need welcome. Do you copy?

1074
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:33,241
Do you copy, Scotty?

1075
01:29:33,252 --> 01:29:35,553
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,
open door in 10...

1076
01:29:35,611 --> 01:29:36,994
- Scotty!
- 9.

1077
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,465
- The person counting down, what is that?
- I think you hear things, mate..

1078
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,510
7.

1079
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:42,250
- Mr. Scott, where are you?
- 6.

1080
01:29:42,261 --> 01:29:44,400
- 1800 meters, 1600 meters.
- 5.

1081
01:29:44,544 --> 01:29:46,010
- Scotty, where are you?
- 3.

1082
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:48,035
- You copy? Please!
- 2.

1083
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,074
- Sorry about this. - For what?
- Mr. Scott open the door!

1084
01:29:50,111 --> 01:29:51,941
- Open the door!
- Mr. Scott, now!

1085
01:30:13,356 --> 01:30:14,956
Welcome aboard.

1086
01:30:16,925 --> 01:30:18,405
It's good to see you, Scotty.

1087
01:30:18,444 --> 01:30:20,086
Who is that?

1088
01:30:21,268 --> 01:30:22,921
Khan, Scotty,
Scotty, Khan.

1089
01:30:22,925 --> 01:30:24,537
Hello.

1090
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:28,131
They know we are here.
I know the best way to bridge.

1091
01:30:32,788 --> 01:30:34,490
It's locked to stun.

1092
01:30:34,806 --> 01:30:37,482
- Theirs won't be.
- Try not get shot.

1093
01:30:41,206 --> 01:30:44,373
Commander, I have that
transmission as requested.

1094
01:30:44,502 --> 01:30:47,226
- On screen, please.
- Stand by.

1095
01:30:53,608 --> 01:30:55,169
Mr. Spock.

1096
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,874
Mr. Spock.

1097
01:31:02,297 --> 01:31:03,933
Admiral.

1098
01:31:06,575 --> 01:31:08,556
I'll deal with
you in moment...

1099
01:31:10,036 --> 01:31:12,382
I'm ashamed to
be your daughter.

1100
01:31:16,483 --> 01:31:19,602
Sir, we did have a hangar
door open on deck 13.

1101
01:31:20,566 --> 01:31:21,906
Khan.

1102
01:31:21,966 --> 01:31:24,106
They are going to have full
power, and we are walking?

1103
01:31:24,131 --> 01:31:26,610
The turbo-lift is easily tracked, and
Marcus would have us in a cage.

1104
01:31:26,721 --> 01:31:29,249
This path right takes us
to the engine room.

1105
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,460
And won't be able to use their weapons here
without destabilizing the warp core.

1106
01:31:32,495 --> 01:31:35,670
- Which gives us the advantage. - Where
did you find this guy? - It's a long story.

1107
01:31:36,554 --> 01:31:38,303
I'll be brief.

1108
01:31:38,403 --> 01:31:41,901
In your travels, did you ever
encounter a man named Khan?

1109
01:31:47,248 --> 01:31:50,481
As you know, I have made a vow
to never give you information,

1110
01:31:50,556 --> 01:31:53,174
that could potentially
alter you destiny.

1111
01:31:54,386 --> 01:31:58,788
Your path is yours to walk,
and yours alone.

1112
01:32:02,503 --> 01:32:04,602
That being said,

1113
01:32:05,985 --> 01:32:09,843
Khan Noonien Singh is the
most dangerous adversary,

1114
01:32:09,878 --> 01:32:12,300
the Enterprise ever faced.

1115
01:32:12,886 --> 01:32:15,720
He is brilliant, ruthless,

1116
01:32:15,974 --> 01:32:20,698
and will not hesitate to kill
every single one of you.

1117
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:26,210
Did you defeat him?

1118
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:29,367
At great cost,

1119
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,765
yes.

1120
01:32:32,055 --> 01:32:33,369
How?

1121
01:32:33,437 --> 01:32:35,702
I don't need to temp faith here
but where is everybody?

1122
01:32:35,708 --> 01:32:38,142
The ship was designed to flown with
minimal crew, one if necessary.

1123
01:32:38,169 --> 01:32:39,529
One?

1124
01:33:00,042 --> 01:33:01,988
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1125
01:33:02,287 --> 01:33:03,858
Where is Khan?

1126
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:13,076
Lieutenant, I need you to assembly all senior, medical
and engineering staff at the weapons-bay.

1127
01:33:13,712 --> 01:33:15,199
All right.

1128
01:33:16,338 --> 01:33:20,705
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently activated
a torpedo, could you replicate the process?

1129
01:33:20,715 --> 01:33:23,746
Oh, why the hell would I want to do that?
I'm not a torpedo technician.

1130
01:33:23,784 --> 01:33:27,384
The fact that you're doctor is precisely
why I need you to listen very carefully.

1131
01:33:28,972 --> 01:33:30,576
Where is he?

1132
01:33:35,567 --> 01:33:37,007
Shit!

1133
01:33:37,262 --> 01:33:38,873
This way.

1134
01:33:41,772 --> 01:33:44,068
The minute we get to
the bridge, drop him.

1135
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:47,742
What, stunning Khan?
I think he is helping us.

1136
01:33:47,943 --> 01:33:49,886
I'm pretty sure
we are helping him.

1137
01:33:58,568 --> 01:34:01,998
- Are we coming on-line, sir.
- Re-target Enterprise, now. - Aye, sir.

1138
01:34:16,063 --> 01:34:18,257
Make sure he stays down.

1139
01:34:18,964 --> 01:34:20,610
Excuse me.

1140
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:25,856
Admiral Marcus,
you are under arrest.

1141
01:34:25,863 --> 01:34:28,199
You are not actually
going to this, are you?

1142
01:34:29,825 --> 01:34:31,845
Admiral get out of the chair.

1143
01:34:31,855 --> 01:34:34,512
You better stop and think about
what are you doing, Kirk.

1144
01:34:34,532 --> 01:34:36,672
You better think about
what you did on Kronos.

1145
01:34:36,926 --> 01:34:39,553
You made an incursion
on an enemy planet.

1146
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,415
You killed a Klingon patrol.

1147
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:44,874
Even if you got out
without trace, war is coming!

1148
01:34:45,066 --> 01:34:46,923
And who's going to lead us?

1149
01:34:47,152 --> 01:34:48,832
You?

1150
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:53,308
If I'm not in charge our entire
way of life is decimated.

1151
01:34:54,092 --> 01:34:56,751
So, you want me off this ship,

1152
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,900
you better kill me.

1153
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:01,234
I'm not going to kill you, sir.

1154
01:35:02,288 --> 01:35:05,740
But I could stun your ass
and drag you out of the chair.

1155
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,000
But, I'd rather not do that
in front of your daughter.

1156
01:35:12,442 --> 01:35:14,915
- You all-right?
- Yes, Captain.

1157
01:35:16,714 --> 01:35:18,042
Jim!

1158
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:33,160
Listen!
Wait!

1159
01:35:46,317 --> 01:35:50,316
You should have let me sleep.

1160
01:35:55,148 --> 01:35:56,801
Where's the Captain, Mr. Sulu?

1161
01:35:56,805 --> 01:35:59,201
Our sensor arrays are down, sir.
I can't find him.

1162
01:36:00,851 --> 01:36:02,614
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

1163
01:36:02,615 --> 01:36:05,546
- Captain!
- Your crew for my crew.

1164
01:36:05,547 --> 01:36:08,598
- You betrayed us.
- You are smart, Mr. Spock.

1165
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,740
Spock, don't...

1166
01:36:12,832 --> 01:36:16,068
Mr. Spock, give me my crew.

1167
01:36:16,749 --> 01:36:18,502
And what will you do
when you get them?

1168
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:20,796
Continue the work we were doing
before we were banished.

1169
01:36:20,803 --> 01:36:22,962
Which as I understand it involves
the mass genocide

1170
01:36:22,963 --> 01:36:25,725
of any being you find
to be less than superior.

1171
01:36:25,763 --> 01:36:28,006
Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock?

1172
01:36:28,409 --> 01:36:31,063
Or will you give me
what I want?

1173
01:36:33,617 --> 01:36:35,517
We have no transporter capabilities.

1174
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,886
Fortunately, mine perfectly functional.
Drop your shields.

1175
01:36:39,991 --> 01:36:43,688
If I do so, I have no guarantee
that you will not destroy the Enterprise.

1176
01:36:43,702 --> 01:36:46,096
Well, let's play this
out logically then, Mr. Spock.

1177
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,518
Firstly, I will kill your Captain
to demonstrate my resolve,

1178
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,337
and then if yours holds,
I'll will have no choice,

1179
01:36:52,338 --> 01:36:54,900
but to kill you and
your entire crew.

1180
01:36:54,908 --> 01:36:59,295
If you destroy our ship,
you will also destroy your own people.

1181
01:36:59,302 --> 01:37:01,913
Your crew requires oxygen
to survive. Mine does not.

1182
01:37:02,099 --> 01:37:06,042
I will target your life support
systems located behind the arcne cell.

1183
01:37:06,047 --> 01:37:09,401
And after every single person
on-board your ship suffocates,

1184
01:37:09,482 --> 01:37:13,922
I will walk over your cold
corpses to recover my people.

1185
01:37:16,586 --> 01:37:18,186
Now...

1186
01:37:18,754 --> 01:37:20,868
shall we begin?

1187
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:26,589
Lower shields.

1188
01:37:29,681 --> 01:37:31,690
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.

1189
01:37:40,345 --> 01:37:43,438
I see, all the 72 torpedoes
are still in their tubes.

1190
01:37:43,453 --> 01:37:45,950
If they are not mine,
Commander I will know it.

1191
01:37:45,971 --> 01:37:48,164
Vulcan's do not lie.

1192
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:51,449
The torpedoes are yours.

1193
01:38:01,954 --> 01:38:03,785
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

1194
01:38:04,009 --> 01:38:06,077
I have fulfilled your terms.

1195
01:38:06,775 --> 01:38:08,484
Now, full-fill mine.

1196
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,509
Well, Kirk.

1197
01:38:11,204 --> 01:38:13,542
It seems right
to return to your crew.

1198
01:38:14,176 --> 01:38:15,702
After all...

1199
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:22,048
no, ship should go down
without her Captain.

1200
01:38:24,715 --> 01:38:26,613
He has locking phasers on us, sir.

1201
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,516
Get us out here, now!

1202
01:38:42,464 --> 01:38:44,308
Shields at 6%.

1203
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:47,945
- The torpedoes, how much time,
Lieutenant? - 12 seconds, sir.

1204
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:50,715
The crew of the Enterprise, prepare
for immediate proximity detonation.

1205
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,697
What are he talking about?
What detonation?

1206
01:38:52,708 --> 01:38:54,817
He just armed
the damn torpedoes.

1207
01:39:04,858 --> 01:39:07,408
No!

1208
01:39:12,937 --> 01:39:15,081
Sir, the weapons
have been knocked out.

1209
01:39:15,748 --> 01:39:18,126
- Not bad, Commander.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

1210
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:20,870
- Bones!
- Bones, nurse!

1211
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:28,763
- Good to see you, Jim. - You helped
Spock detonate those torpedoes?

1212
01:39:28,773 --> 01:39:31,056
- Damn right I did.
- He killed Khan's crew.

1213
01:39:31,407 --> 01:39:33,507
Spock is cold, but he not that cold...

1214
01:39:33,618 --> 01:39:35,400
I've got Khan's crew.

1215
01:39:35,532 --> 01:39:37,270
72 human popsicles.

1216
01:39:37,275 --> 01:39:39,875
Safe and sound
in their Cryo-tubes.

1217
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,696
Son of a bitch!

1218
01:39:48,323 --> 01:39:50,151
Sir, the central power grid is failing.

1219
01:39:50,162 --> 01:39:53,164
- Switch to auxiliary power.
- Auxiliary power failing, sir.

1220
01:40:00,772 --> 01:40:02,777
Commander, our ship is
caught in Earth's gravity.

1221
01:40:02,925 --> 01:40:05,140
- Can we stop?
- I can't do anything.

1222
01:40:16,526 --> 01:40:18,099
Clear the area!

1223
01:40:18,453 --> 01:40:20,212
Engage emergency lock-down!

1224
01:40:20,303 --> 01:40:23,067
- I hope you don't get seasick.
- Do you? - Yeah.

1225
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,769
- Lieutenant, sound evacuation to all decks.
- Aye, sir.

1226
01:40:27,489 --> 01:40:30,721
As active Captain I order
you to abandon this ship.

1227
01:40:31,807 --> 01:40:33,730
I will remain behind
and devote all power

1228
01:40:33,731 --> 01:40:36,131
to life support and
evacuation shuttle bays.

1229
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:37,949
<i>Evacuation to all crew!</i>

1230
01:40:37,952 --> 01:40:40,034
I order you to abandon this ship!

1231
01:40:40,045 --> 01:40:43,597
All due respect, Commander,
but we are not going anywhere.

1232
01:40:47,656 --> 01:40:50,200
One day I've been off this ship.
One bloody day!

1233
01:40:54,864 --> 01:40:57,560
Gravity systems are
failing. Hold on! Hold on!

1234
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,690
There will be no time for evacuation
if don't get power to stabilize the damn ship.

1235
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:15,366
- Can we restore it?
- Only from engineering.

1236
01:41:15,672 --> 01:41:18,060
We have to get back
to the warp core.

1237
01:41:20,898 --> 01:41:22,325
Jim.

1238
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,931
Scotty, we must get
the power back on. Come on!

1239
01:41:43,512 --> 01:41:45,410
- We got to jump! - What?
- Jump! Jump!

1240
01:41:45,412 --> 01:41:46,982
Oh, God!

1241
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:51,315
Emergency power
at 15% and dropping.

1242
01:42:11,069 --> 01:42:12,472
- Jim.
- Hold on!

1243
01:42:12,573 --> 01:42:13,981
I can't.

1244
01:42:32,651 --> 01:42:34,339
I got you, Captain.

1245
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:36,271
- Chekov.
- Don't let go.

1246
01:42:46,822 --> 01:42:49,808
Even if we get the warp core on-line
we still need to re-direct the power.

1247
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:51,639
- He's right, Captain.
- What are you talking about?

1248
01:42:51,642 --> 01:42:53,706
Someone have to hit
the manual override.

1249
01:42:53,727 --> 01:42:56,146
- Lad there is a switch.
- Behind the deflect dish.

1250
01:42:56,157 --> 01:42:58,107
- I bridge the switch.
- Let's go.

1251
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:03,008
Oh, no!

1252
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:23,300
Mr. Sulu, divert every remaining
power to the stabilizers.

1253
01:43:23,303 --> 01:43:25,526
I do what I can, sir.
I do what I can.

1254
01:43:41,367 --> 01:43:43,109
<i>Core misaligned.</i>

1255
01:43:43,695 --> 01:43:45,595
- Danger.
- Oh, no! No, no, no!

1256
01:43:45,596 --> 01:43:47,690
- Core misaligned.
- Housings are miss-aligned.

1257
01:43:47,699 --> 01:43:49,401
There's no way we
can re-direct the power.

1258
01:43:49,702 --> 01:43:52,058
The ship is dead, sir.
She's gone.

1259
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:53,500
<i>Danger.</i>

1260
01:43:53,513 --> 01:43:56,700
- No, she's not.
- Wait, Jim.

1261
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,340
If we go in there, will...

1262
01:43:58,342 --> 01:44:00,424
Will you listen to me?
What the hell are you doing?

1263
01:44:00,459 --> 01:44:03,886
- I'm opening the door. I'm going in.
- That door is stop us to get irradiated.

1264
01:44:03,897 --> 01:44:06,279
We will be dead before
we made the climb.

1265
01:44:08,603 --> 01:44:10,621
You are not
making the climb.

1266
01:45:15,766 --> 01:45:19,590
If we don't get power and shields back on-line
we going to be incinerate at re-entry.

1267
01:46:27,096 --> 01:46:30,112
- Warp core is back on-line.
- Maximum thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

1268
01:46:36,164 --> 01:46:38,038
Standby, standby.

1269
01:47:04,889 --> 01:47:07,272
- Shields restored.
- Commander, power on-line.

1270
01:47:07,603 --> 01:47:09,708
Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing.

1271
01:47:10,063 --> 01:47:11,837
It's a miracle.

1272
01:47:12,677 --> 01:47:15,417
There are no such things.

1273
01:47:17,905 --> 01:47:19,708
Engineering to bridge, Mr. Spock.

1274
01:47:19,809 --> 01:47:22,928
- Mr. Scott.
- Sir, you better get down here.

1275
01:47:23,705 --> 01:47:25,439
You better hurry.

1276
01:47:47,689 --> 01:47:50,480
- Open it! - The decontamination
process is not complete.

1277
01:47:50,485 --> 01:47:53,491
You will flood the whole compartment.
The door is locked, sir.

1278
01:48:23,408 --> 01:48:25,827
How's the ship?
How's the ship?

1279
01:48:27,451 --> 01:48:29,080
Out of danger.

1280
01:48:31,524 --> 01:48:33,139
You saved the crew.

1281
01:48:35,162 --> 01:48:37,607
You used what he
wanted against him.

1282
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:43,757
That's a nice move.

1283
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:47,002
It is what you would have done.

1284
01:48:48,965 --> 01:48:52,934
And this, this is what
you would have done.

1285
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:55,108
It was only logical.

1286
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,979
I'm scared, Spock.

1287
01:49:06,851 --> 01:49:08,977
Help me to not to.

1288
01:49:12,633 --> 01:49:15,467
How do you choose not to feel.

1289
01:49:21,525 --> 01:49:23,607
I do not know.

1290
01:49:25,574 --> 01:49:27,829
Right now I'm failing.

1291
01:49:33,936 --> 01:49:37,019
I want you to know
why I couldn't let you die...

1292
01:49:40,552 --> 01:49:42,701
Why I went back for you.

1293
01:49:44,346 --> 01:49:46,843
Because you're my friend.

1294
01:51:06,815 --> 01:51:11,507
Khan!

1295
01:51:12,606 --> 01:51:14,402
That was close.

1296
01:51:16,488 --> 01:51:20,255
Set destination
starfleet headquarters!

1297
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:24,034
<i>Engines compromised.
Cannot guarantee destination.</i>

1298
01:51:24,175 --> 01:51:26,120
<i>Confirm order.</i>

1299
01:51:26,165 --> 01:51:28,163
Confirmed.

1300
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,685
Search the enemy
ship for signs of life.

1301
01:52:30,737 --> 01:52:32,857
Sir, there is no way
anyone survives.

1302
01:52:34,403 --> 01:52:36,881
- He could.
- Yes, sir.

1303
01:53:07,177 --> 01:53:08,977
Wow, he just jumped 30 meters.

1304
01:53:09,244 --> 01:53:12,620
- Can we beam him up? - There is too much
damage. I have no incoming signal.

1305
01:53:13,106 --> 01:53:15,675
But it maybe possible
to beam you down, sir.

1306
01:53:16,215 --> 01:53:17,985
Go get him.

1307
01:53:22,607 --> 01:53:24,673
- Standby for coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

1308
01:53:25,127 --> 01:53:28,969
- Enter 3517 by 2598.
- Coordinates confirmed.

1309
01:55:03,056 --> 01:55:05,937
Get me a Cryo-tube, now!

1310
01:55:58,338 --> 01:56:00,018
Get this men out of Cryo!

1311
01:56:00,024 --> 01:56:02,700
Keep him in an induced coma!
We are going to put Kirk inside.

1312
01:56:03,204 --> 01:56:06,430
- It's our only chance to preserve his brain
function. - How much Khan's blood is left?

1313
01:56:06,832 --> 01:56:08,232
None.

1314
01:56:08,532 --> 01:56:11,208
Enterprise to Spock.
Spock!

1315
01:57:09,114 --> 01:57:11,262
Activate the cryogenic sequence.

1316
01:57:13,511 --> 01:57:15,850
McCoy to bridge.
I can't reach Spock.

1317
01:57:16,069 --> 01:57:20,660
I need Khan alive, you get that son of
the bitch on-board, right now!

1318
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:23,520
I think he can save Kirk.

1319
01:57:23,540 --> 01:57:26,856
- Can we beam them up to the ship? - As they
keep moving, I cant get lock on either of them.

1320
01:57:27,131 --> 01:57:29,158
Can you beam someone down?

1321
01:58:10,258 --> 01:58:12,132
Spock! Stop!

1322
01:58:12,557 --> 01:58:15,843
Stop! He is our only
chance to safe Kirk.

1323
01:58:25,069 --> 01:58:26,546
What is it?

1324
01:58:26,625 --> 01:58:27,639
Who are you?

1325
01:58:27,674 --> 01:58:32,002
- This coming to... - Your father was Captain,
only for 16 minutes and he saved his crew...lives.

1326
01:58:32,005 --> 01:58:33,803
***

1327
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:45,960
Don't be so melodramatic,
you were barely dead.

1328
01:58:46,868 --> 01:58:48,920
It was the transfusion
that really took it's toll.

1329
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:51,302
- You were out cold for two weeks.
- Transfusion?

1330
01:58:51,450 --> 01:58:53,989
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1331
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:55,739
Khan?

1332
01:58:56,062 --> 01:58:59,334
Once we caught him, I synthesized
serum from his super blood.

1333
01:58:59,755 --> 01:59:03,652
Tell me, are you feeling homicidal
power-man, despotic?

1334
01:59:03,856 --> 01:59:05,709
No more than usual.

1335
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:08,663
- How did you get him?
- I didn't.

1336
01:59:17,338 --> 01:59:19,008
You saved my life.

1337
01:59:19,046 --> 01:59:22,023
Uhura and I has something
to do with it too, you know?

1338
01:59:22,839 --> 01:59:26,294
- You saved my life, Captain and
life of many on the ship... - Spock, just...

1339
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:30,640
Thank you.

1340
01:59:31,773 --> 01:59:33,796
You are welcome, Jim.

1341
01:59:44,323 --> 01:59:47,309
<i>There will always be those
who mean to do us harm.</i>

1342
01:59:49,687 --> 01:59:54,904
<i>To stop them, we risk wakening
the same evil within ourselves.</i>

1343
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:03,948
<i>Our first instinct
is to seek revenge,</i>

1344
02:00:04,049 --> 02:00:06,521
<i>when those we love
are taken from us.</i>

1345
02:00:09,450 --> 02:00:11,181
But that's not who we are.

1346
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:17,385
We are here today
to rechrist an USS Enterprise.

1347
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:22,606
And to honor those who
lost their life, nearly one year ago.

1348
02:00:23,979 --> 02:00:28,033
When Christopher Pike first gave me his ship
he had me recite the Captains oath.

1349
02:00:29,372 --> 02:00:31,969
Words I didn't appreciate at that time.

1350
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:35,889
Now I see them as a call
for us to remember...

1351
02:00:37,075 --> 02:00:38,830
who we once were...

1352
02:00:40,538 --> 02:00:43,328
And who we must be again.

1353
02:00:43,927 --> 02:00:46,074
<i>And those words...</i>

1354
02:00:46,222 --> 02:00:49,036
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1355
02:00:49,774 --> 02:00:53,264
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

1356
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:58,320
<i>Her five year mission,
to explore strange new worlds...</i>

1357
02:00:58,476 --> 02:01:01,577
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations...</i>

1358
02:01:02,527 --> 02:01:06,554
<i>To boldly go where no one
has gone before.</i>

1359
02:01:09,932 --> 02:01:11,527
Captain on the bridge.

1360
02:01:15,059 --> 02:01:17,199
It's hard to get out of it
once you got a taste.

1361
02:01:17,328 --> 02:01:19,027
Isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1362
02:01:19,197 --> 02:01:20,887
Captain does have
nice ring to it.

1363
02:01:21,238 --> 02:01:23,100
Chair is all yours, sir.

1364
02:01:24,536 --> 02:01:26,883
Mr. Scott, how's our core?

1365
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:31,172
Purring like a kitten, Captain.
She's ready for a long journey.

1366
02:01:31,616 --> 02:01:34,503
Excellent. Come on, Bones,
it's going to be fun.

1367
02:01:36,296 --> 02:01:39,136
Five years in space,
God help me!

1368
02:01:40,036 --> 02:01:41,541
Doctor Marcus.

1369
02:01:43,046 --> 02:01:46,078
- I'm glad you could be part of the family.
- It's nice to have a family.

1370
02:01:49,304 --> 02:01:51,212
- Spock.
- Captain.

1371
02:01:54,207 --> 02:01:55,952
Where should we go?

1372
02:01:57,282 --> 02:02:00,508
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted...

1373
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,887
I prefer to your good
judgement, Captain.

1374
02:02:14,207 --> 02:02:16,500
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1375
02:02:16,802 --> 02:02:18,300
Aye, Captain.

1376
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:33,100
