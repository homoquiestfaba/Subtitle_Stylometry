She inherited her kingdom from

because they

349
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,165

would hang the bodies up

00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,216
On the subject of so-called
acquaintance rape,

488
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,183
or date rape.

489
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,153
They found that nearly 80% of
these women

490
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,622
had been molested as children.

491
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,491
I'm not one to argue with their
results.

492
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,961
But they conclude that quote,
"these women don't

493
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,563
know how to set boundaries."

494
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,699
And what does that mean?

495
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,733
It's a bunch of bunk.

496
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,734
Bunk.

497
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,836
Bottom line is, they don't know
how to say no.

498
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,104
And whose fault is that?

499
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,808
No, I think most of these young
ladies seduced their daddies.

- Sort of.

Oh, the rapist.

519
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,255

00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,890
Right.

I haven't seen him around
lately.

523
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,195
Yeah, after they set his nose
in the emergency room,

524
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,429

your friend

would go back to L.A. instead of
going to the cops?

541
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,924
I'm Suzy, and I'm back.

542
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:26,925
We're back.

543
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,195
And what do I get if I put you
on the radio?

544
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,208
Who is our caller?

545
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,014
JOE: This hour we about breast
feeding in restaurants.

546
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,216
Ladies, you didn't bring enough
for everybody,

547
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,151
leave them at home.

548
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,986
Oh, so it takes a real man to
screw

549
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,788
a girl who can't even stand up.

550
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,256
Is that how you guys get most of
your dates?

551
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,891
There's no excuse for rape.

552
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,926
Next?

553
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,794
BILL (ON PHONE): Hi, this is
Bill from Lynwood.

554
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,629
Oh, it takes a lot of guts to
admit that.

555
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,730
Go on.

556
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,431
BRIAN (ON PHONE): Yeah, I'm
surprised there's not

557
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,299
more sexual assault on women.

558
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:07,999
Look what you wear, the skimpy
skirts,

559
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,802
and the bras with no shirts on.

560
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:11,870
I see where this is going.

561
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,071
So if we get dressed up, and
then

562
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,707
we complain about getting raped,
then that's not real good.

563
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,143
That's great, yeah, you really
are from Lynwood, aren't you?

564
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,110
Next.

565
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,281
And I don't think we should
limit it to sex offenders,

566
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,349
either.

567
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,952
Mean date rapists, men who
sexually harass women.

568
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,887
I mean, I think should cut off
all their balls.

569
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,028
See something you like, grandpa?

570
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,697
CALLER (ON PHONE): Hey, where's
Joe.

571
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,764
What's it to you?

572
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,333
CALLER (ON PHONE): I'll tell you
what it is to me.

573
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,168
And I own this station.

574
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,903
And you're aren't breaking
several laws

575
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,273
that I know of, and probably
several others, including

576
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,375
kidnapping, which is a felony.

577
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,509
SHELLY: Oh, great.

578
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,678
CALLER (ON PHONE): The cops are
on their way right now.

579
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,779
OK, let's go.

580
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:55,480
CALLER (ON PHONE): You'd just
better hope that Joe

581
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,614
isn't hurt, because if he is--

582
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,984
Listen, we're going to leave
you with a song that we

583
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,086
really, really like, and thank
you so much for listening.

584
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,154
Good night.

585
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,322
Goodbye, sweetie.

586
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,857
Have a good one.

587
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,791
Let's go.

588
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:07,726
All right.

589
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,997
[GRUNTING]

590
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,185
[CHEERING]

591
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,755
[LAUGHING]

592
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,789
Let's go, let's go.

593
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,100
Stop, or I'll shoot!

594
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,468
Oh, like you'd really shoot a
girl.

595
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,436
Come on.

596
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,742
SUZY: (SINGING) This girl that
you know well.

597
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,311
She last a minute strong.

598
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:05,350
She's stress your own men's
smiles with that TV on.

599
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:11,089
With a fashion magazine, they
lay across the floor.

600
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:16,061
With closet full of new clothes
that she never wore.

601
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,030
She's always dressed for every
occasion,

602
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,032
smiles and perfume her
persuasion.

603
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,067
You know Lisa.

604
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:30,375
With any bad joke, she'll laugh,
I've heard her laugh.

605
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:36,347
Pick her out a [INAUDIBLE] and
say, cry.

606
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,549
He goes, such a bitch.

607
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,985
She says she knows, but it's OK.

608
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:45,356
'Cause when she on top, they
made love anyway.

609
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,927
She's always dressed for every
occasion,

610
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,264
smiles and perfume her
persuasion, You know Lisa.

611
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,234
You know Lisa.

612
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,236
You know Lisa.

613
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,270
You know Lisa.

614
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,176
It's OK.

615
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,146
It's the way she likes to be.

616
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:13,084
And most say she's just funny
that way, she does it cleverly.

617
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:16,921
She's always dressed for every
occasion, smiles and perfume,

618
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,925
her persuasion, you know Lisa.

619
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,828
You know Lisa.

620
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,531
You know Lisa.

621
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,134
You know Lisa.

622
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,468
You know Lisa.

623
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,070
You know Lisa.

624
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,882
I'm going to go to the
bathroom.

625
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,192
Love you.

626
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,260
Love you too.

627
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,304
OK some things I hate about
Cindy Crawford.

628
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,439
First off let me just say that I
don't hate Cindy Crawford.

629
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,641
I don't even know Cindy
Crawford.

630
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,976
But she's made a choice to
represent a standard that women

631
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,211
find impossible achieve.

632
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,014
In fact, even Cindy herself
hasn't achieved that shag rug

633
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,315
eyelash perky breast look that
we

634
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,550
all see on the cover of Cosmo.

635
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,285
It's all airbrushed and computer
enhanced.

636
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,920
And speaking of choice, some
people

637
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,988
say that women are programed and
don't really have a choice

638
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,190
about what they do in life.

639
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,891
But in my opinion, Cindy isn't
done.

640
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,927
In fact, if other models put as
much time and effort

641
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,029
into exploring their
intelligence, or creativity

642
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,164
as they do into plucking their
eyebrows, injecting their lips

643
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,399
or bending over in front of the
camera,

644
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,466
we'd have cured cancer by now.

645
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,969
But Cindy has allowed herself to
be a dupe for all

646
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,170
those assholes who go to our
clubs

647
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,539
and the places where we hang
out, see what we're wearing.

648
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,942
Then they go back to their
Manhattan high rise offices,

649
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,643
draw a picture of it, have some
poor oppressed women

650
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,512
in Taiwan sew it up for a couple
of cents.

651
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,647
Slap it on Cindy's ass, so she
can wiggle down the runway

652
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,049
and sell it to a bunch of rich
mother

653
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,283
fuckers for a grand and a half.

654
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,551
Then we go back to the same
place

655
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,186
to buy the same shit we bought
last week,

656
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,321
because it was comfortable.

657
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,022
Only now the price is five times
higher,

658
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,090
because it's hip and trendy.

659
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,024
I don't think so.

660
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,031
SUZY: I don't think we're going
to be able to practice tonight,

661
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,666
because I gotta go see my mom.

662
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,068
It's her birthday.

663
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,436
SHELLY: I'm sorry.

664
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,137
Why are you sorry?

665
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,406
I know how much you hate seeing
your mom.

666
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,476
I wouldn't go, but she called
last night.

667
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,510
How is she?

668
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,945
Well, she was drunk.

669
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:21,913
As usual.

670
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,048
Could hear her boyfriend in the
background.

671
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,384
She's cocktailing, and he's on
disability.

672
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,953
God, what a bunch of losers.

673
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,655
Sometimes I wish she would die.

674
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,090
Do you really?

675
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,158
No.

676
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,160
I do wish she'd go away, though.

677
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,595
Can I ask you a question?

678
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,530
SUZY: Sure.

679
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:43,301
Did anything ever happen to you
when you were growing up?

680
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,335
Like what?

681
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,471
Like did any of your mom's
boyfriends ever--

682
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,705
No.

683
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,141
No one ever fucked with me.

684
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,278
Or should I say no one ever
fucked me.

685
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,346
Unless I let them.

686
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,348
I never let them.

687
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,383
I'm sorry.

688
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,717
I didn't mean to upset you.

689
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,287
SUZY: You didn't upset me.

690
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,721
Oh, I got a call from Debra
yesterday.

691
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,123
SHELLY: Who's that?

692
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,391
My friend that went to
Washington D.C.

693
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,126
a little while ago. SHELLY: Oh,
right.

694
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,128
She works with this group, Stop
The Violence.

695
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,130
She organizes demonstrations and
lobbying.

696
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:16,234
It's like, there are so many
activists down there right now.

697
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,602
She really loves it.

698
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,470
What are you saying?

699
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,738
I don't know, I--

700
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,740
I sometimes feel like if I was
in New York, if I was in D.C. I

701
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,310
could be doing something more.

702
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,211
I mean don't you ever feel like
we should be doing more?

703
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,212
For the cause.

704
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,115
Well, what about the music?

705
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,450
No, I'd never leave the band.

706
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,686
No, what about the music?

707
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,321
What do you mean?

708
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,424
I mean, music for music's sake.

709
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,226
I think music is a means to an
end.

710
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,494
Well, I'm not sure I agree with
you.

711
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,430
Of course you agree with me.

712
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,798
You always agree with me.

713
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,133
That's what makes you so great.
- Yeah, right.

714
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,393
SHELLY: Hi.

715
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,327
Hey.

716
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,096
SHELLY: What are you doing here?

717
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,564
I was just in the neighborhood.

718
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,631
Thought I'd stop by.

719
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,833
What?

720
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,102
It's just such a stupid thing
to say.

721
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,270
What's so stupid?

722
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,140
Well, I was just in the
neighborhood.

723
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,143
I'm sure you were.

724
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,412
So, where are we going?

725
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,380
I don't know.

726
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,482
Thought maybe we could go for
some coffee

727
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,851
at Lula's or something?

728
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,253
Why don't we just go to your
house?

729
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,322
It's in the next block, isn't
it?

730
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,523
How'd you know?

731
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,725
I've passed a couple of times.

732
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,795
I was just in the neighborhood.

733
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:51,763
Let me get my things.

734
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,668
I like this cartoon.

735
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,803
Which one?

736
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,772
The one where the girl carries
the guy's penis around

737
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,706
with her.

738
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:02,840
Oh, that one.

739
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,809
SHELLY: So you're really into
this shit, aren't you?

740
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,043
JIMMY: Yeah.

741
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,713
I'm very interested in getting
my message out there any way

742
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,649
I can.

743
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,551
You really didn't think you
could tell me?

744
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,485
No, I didn't.

745
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,460
That kind of hurts.

746
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,728
Still can't believe a friend of
mine

747
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,129
would do something like that.

748
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,564
Well, he did.

749
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,765
How?

750
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,866
I don't want to talk about it.

751
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,605
You want something to drink?

752
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,757
This is a great house.

753
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,793
JIMMY: It belongs to Brian's
grandmother.

754
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:59,230
He gets free rent so long as he
takes care of the place.

755
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,164
That's cool.

756
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,667
Yeah, works for me.

757
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,403
You don't need that.

758
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,405
What.

759
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,640
You don't have to be nervous
around me.

760
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:10,808
I'm not nervous.

761
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,480
Yeah, you are.

762
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,282
I'm not!

763
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,450
But you've changed.

764
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,558
When did you decide to become a
riot girl?

765
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,426
I don't know.

766
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,328
When did you decide to become a
slacker?

767
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,929
JIMMY: I'm not a slacker.

768
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,231
I'm not a riot girl.

769
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,637
Well, what's the deal with your
lead singer?

770
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,839
Suzy?

771
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,740
She's my lover.

772
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:43,708
Why?

773
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,980
[LAUGHING]

774
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,249
She's what?

775
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,285
Isn't that what you wanted to
know?

776
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,687
Well, no.

777
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,824
I mean, I just wanted to know
what her story was.

778
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,731
So.

779
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,432
Wow.

780
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,402
You left me for her.

781
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:15,640
No, I left you because I was
having emotional problems.

782
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,009
And then we started the band,
and we just--

783
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:18,976
She seduced you?

784
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,978
No one seduced anyone.

785
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,381
How did it happen?

786
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,552
We were just watching a movie,
and we were relaxed, and--

787
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,387
What movie were you watching?

788
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,788
Why does that matter?

789
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,790
I'm just curious.

790
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,493
I remember the first movie I
took you to see.

791
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,427
Ghost.

792
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,695
See, you remember.

793
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,730
So you must remember the movie
that you

794
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,499
and Suzy were watching.

795
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,000
OK, OK, it was Snow White.

796
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,407
You got all hot and bothered
over Snow White?

797
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,943
We didn't get all hot and
bothered.

798
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,911
We just-- you know.

799
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:54,979
JIMMY: Are you in love with her?

800
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,747
What?

801
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,784
Are you in love with her?

802
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,685
I don't know.

803
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,454
I don't-- I guess so.

804
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,622
That sounds convincing.

805
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:14,065
SHELLY: Do you still have that
disco tape I made for you?

806
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,800
The one with the version of
"Give Me

807
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,835
Just a Little More Time" on it?

808
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,036
Yeah.

809
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,074
(SINGING) Give me, give me,
give me

810
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,408
just a little more time.

811
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,343
Yeah I still got it.

812
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,780
(SINGING) Give me just a little
more time,

813
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:33,384
and our love will surely grow.

814
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,418
Give me--

815
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,353
Hey.

816
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,361
I think it's in my closet.

817
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,432
I lost mine when I moved.

818
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,569
You can borrow mine, if you
want to make a copy.

819
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,605
You find my address book
interesting?

820
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,106
Oh.

821
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,709
I thought that this was Jimmy's
book.

822
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,611
I was just going to put my
number in it.

823
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,984
Hey, Brian.

824
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,052
Can I see your phone book?

825
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,453
I want to put my number in it.

826
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,387
Sure.

827
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,601
This is my voicemail number.

828
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,604
You can call me here any time
and leave a message.

829
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,572
How's it going?

830
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,883
Well, I guess I'd better go.

831
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,753
Do you want me to give you a
ride?

832
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,422
I don't think that that would
be a very good idea.

833
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,757
I mean I can drop you nearby.

834
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,159
You could walk the rest of the
way.

835
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,127
OK.

836
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:26,864
Later.

837
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:27,798
This is my zine.

838
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,901
"Psychic Roadkill," dedicated to
reviewing

839
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,838
live political national
television.

840
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,040
Everything from "This Week with
David Brinkley"

841
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,776
to "The McLaughlin Group" to
"Nightline."

842
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,912
I review not only the content,
but the performances.

843
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:46,117
And did you know that over 60%
of Ted Koppel's male guests

844
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,918
wear rugs?

845
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,086
I'm not sure why this is, but I
think

846
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,221
it has something to do with the
fact

847
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,791
that Ted himself has like a like
a small animal on top

848
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,760
of his own noggin, right?

849
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:56,761
I mean it.

850
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,162
If he wasn't wearing a rug, he'd
look like Telly

851
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,730
Savala's twin brother.

852
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,699
So maybe this is why bald people
feel

853
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,235
more comfortable on his show.

854
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,070
The other thing about Ted is
he's

855
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,773
got this huge pumpkin head on
top

856
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,175
of these little tiny shoulders,
right?

857
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,711
So despite all these physical
irregularities,

858
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,646
he's a huge TV star.

859
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,847
Makes a ton of dough.

860
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,650
And I've heard he gets more
action the most rock stars.

861
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:20,885
"Psychic Roadkill."

862
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,587
Send six bucks, two stamps--

863
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:27,458
send six stamps, two bucks, and
I also take submissions.

864
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,536
This is it.

865
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,844
Sorry.

866
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,258
Call me.

867
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,226
I will.

00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,204
Hey, there.

869
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,042
How you doing?

870
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,810
SHELLY: Good, how are you?

871
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,687
[BELCH]

872
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,688
Ugh.

873
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,556
Oh. - You're done.

874
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,795
[GROANING]

875
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,032
Yes.

876
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,335
Oh, thank you.

00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,270
SHELLY: Here, I got something to
show you.

SUZY: What is it?

879
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,372
Here.

880
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,074
It's that guy Dale's work
number.

881
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,010
Down in L.A. I thought that
maybe we

882
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,578
could call him and get the
address,

883
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,848
and write to them or something.

884
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,184
Where'd you get this?

885
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:00,985
I--

886
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,655
How did you get his work
number?

887
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,691
Here, let me help you.

888
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,227
Shelly.

889
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,696
You went to see Jimmy, didn't
you?

890
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,764
I had to.

891
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,836
I had to find out where Dale
was.

892
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,906
I don't want what happened to me
to happen to anyone else.

893
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,108
- Makes sense. - That's
bullshit.

894
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,810
Shelly, why are you doing this?

895
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,313
Come on, Suzy, chill out.

896

01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,432
I didn't mean for it to happen,
it just did.

1253
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:51,640
And so what do you want to do
now?

1254
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,642
I want to move back in the
house,

1255
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:58,781
and I want us to have a platonic
relationship.

I'm not sure that's going to
work.

SHELLY: You always said that the
cause came first.

1258
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,821
Here's your chance to prove it.

1259
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,727
What about your boyfriend.

1260
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,363
No, I'm not going to be seeing
anyone.

1261
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:17,433
And I don't want anyone
bothering him.

1262
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,768

bothering him.

1263
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,741
So when do you want to move back
in?

1264
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:26,709
Tomorrow.

1265
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:27,576
Well, why not tonight?

1266

we have

1267
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,281

pack.

You're going back to Suzy?

1275
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,236
SHELLY: I'm not going back to
Suzy.

1276
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,904
I'm moving back in with the
band.

1277
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,606

labels

1278
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,675
that are interested in us.

1279
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:35,377
We need to practice more, and me
and Suzy have decided to have

1280
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:36,879
a platonic relationship.

1281
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:37,847
What about us?

1282
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:45,421
You weren't even going to tell
me, were you?

1283
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,290
You were just going to split,
without saying a word.

1284
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:50,259
You lied to me.

1285
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,229
How could you do that?

1286
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:56,232
I'm not leaving until tomorrow.

1287
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,667
I figured we could have one last
night together.

1288
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,503
Oh, how fun.

1289
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:03,539
Sort of like playing the last
game of shuffleboard

1291
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,609
I could leave earlier, if you'd
like.

more money.

1295

I didn't ask you to do that.

How fun.

1297
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,755
I'm doing this as much for you
as I am for me.

01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:21,390
JIMMY: Jesus, I should have
listened to Brian.

1299
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,259
You know he said she's trouble.
Would I listen?

1300
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,493
No.

1301
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:25,194
You need someone sweet and
sensitive, not someone like me

1302
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,061

easier to practice.

all people

1308

get my music out there.

pisses me off was the way

01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:37,873

01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:35,229
We are made to bleed, and scab
and heal and bleed again.

1599
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:40,968
And turn every scar into a joke.

1600
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:45,606
We are made to fight, and fuck
and talk and fight again,

1601
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,142
and sit around and laugh until
we choke.

1602
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:51,045
Sit around and laugh until we
choke.

01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:23,144
Don't know who you were
expecting.

1605
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:26,113
Probably some bitch who does not
budge, with

1606
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:31,118
eyes the size of snow.

1607
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,554
I may get pissed off sometimes,
but you

1608
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:36,090
seem like the type to hold a
grudge,

1609
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:39,227
and in the end I just let it go.

1610
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:42,830
In the end I just let it go.

1612
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:16,063
Buildings and bridges are made
bend in the wind.

1613
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:21,636
To withstand the world, that's
what it takes.

1614
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:26,073
All that steel and stone are no
match for the air, my friend.

1615
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:28,042
What doesn't bend breaks.

1616
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:29,710
What doesn't bend breaks.

1617
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:31,646
What doesn't bend breaks.
