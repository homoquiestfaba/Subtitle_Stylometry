00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:26,734
Welcome back, everybody,
to the 1997 World Series of Poker,

2
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:28,274
where Stu "The Kid" Ungar

3
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:32,209
is attempting to make one of
the greatest comebacks in poker history

4
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,442
by winning the no-limit
Texas Hold-em Championship

5
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:37,676
a record third time.

6
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:39,810
And Al,
the amazing thing about this

7
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:42,377
is that Stuey would be
achieving that feat

8
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:45,118
after 16 years
of personal struggle

9
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:48,286
where victories were really
few and far between.

10
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,458
And standing
between Stuey and history

11
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,195
is John Stremp,
a local casino executive

12
00:00:56,303 --> 00:01:00,000
who's shown remarkable fortitude,
actually, in making it to this point.

13
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:06,336
And here it is--Stu is raising enough
to put Stremp all in.

14
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:12,679
This could be it, Al. If Stremp wins,
it'll change the tide of the tournament.

15
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:17,656
If Stuey wins, he's got the championship
again after 16 long years.

16
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:12,142
You're not sure?

17
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:17,306
I thought you're supposed to be
some freaking genius or something.

18
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:19,045
Yeah? Well, fuck you, then.

19
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,921
Come on, Stuey.
You could do better than that.

20
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,555
Do better than what?

21
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,893
I wake up,
you're in my goddamn hotel room

22
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,125
wanting to know
if I seen you before.

23
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:36,327
What kind
of fucked-up game is that?

24
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,702
I thought you liked games.

25
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,740
Cards, horses, football...

26
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:47,139
I heard you play golf, even.

27
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:51,079
You got a good swing, Stuey?

28
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:54,386
So that's what this is about?

29
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:58,688
What do you think it's about?

30
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:02,524
Oh, man. Look...
stop screwing with me.

31
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,427
You do what you gotta do.

32
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:06,956
You in a hurry?

33
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,601
Got a hot date?

34
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,302
What are the odds, Stuey?

35
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,700
You're good with that stuff, right?

36
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:22,441
Maybe you can get to that blade before
I even figured out what you were up to.

37
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,850
You know...
cut and run.

38
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:32,186
Me? I'd say I'm a 20-1 favorite

39
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,319
to slice your fucking heart out
before you're off the bed.

40
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,761
That about right?

41
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:41,834
Hey, I know people, man.
I know important people.

42
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:45,230
Don't get all lathered up, Stuey.

43
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,904
You wanna know
what the game is?

44
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:53,076
I hear you're
a worthless piece of Vegas shit,

45
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:57,139
which is what you kind of look like
at this point, if you don't mind me saying.

46
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:58,275
No offense.

47
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,218
But then I hear other things.

48
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:09,288
Like...you're a--a God
or a legend or something.

49
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:11,330
A bona fide fucking legend.

50
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:13,489
Yeah?

51
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,661
That's interesting.

52
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:22,502
And my job
isn't usually real interesting.

53
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:25,808
So tell me a story.

54
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:29,775
A story?

55
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:31,339
Yeah.

56
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:32,749
About you.

57
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,787
Why the fuck would I?

58
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:38,688
Because then you might figure out
why I'm here.

59
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,350
And if you do that...

60
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:42,586
I'll go.

61
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,060
You'll go?

62
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,963
On my father's eyes.

63
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,840
Get off me!

64
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,382
Give us the money, Ungar!

65
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,918
Don't give us that crap.
Punch him again, Flesh!

66
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,478
No, wait! All right!

67
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:07,806
Hi, Leon.

68
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:34,362
Yeah, Franky. Stupid, I said 1 8.
Yes, 1 8. I don't make the line.

69
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:37,807
You want it or not? I don't wanna hear
a joke. Franky, I don't wanna hear--

70
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,674
I don't...

71
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:41,577
Are you a lonely person?

72
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:43,138
What's the matter with you?

73
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,909
Hey, Pop.

74
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,977
Oh, Christ.
What happened to you?

75
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:51,046
No, sorry. Call me back.

76
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:53,786
Who did this, Stuey?
That Sheinberg kid again?

77
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,452
I'll speak to his father.

78
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:57,393
No, no, no. It's okay.

79
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:00,494
Yeah, it's okay.

80
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,328
You mean that move
we talked about?

81
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:04,460
How?

82
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,835
I dropped some change.
It worked perfect.

83
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:08,066
Where'd you get him?

84
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:12,872
Solly, Stuey got that fat-ass bully
Sheinberg kid right in the chatchkes!

85
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:14,004
Congratulations.

86
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,741
I love it, ah! Beautiful!

87
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,976
That's it, kid.
That's how you're gonna do it.

88
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,450
You're smarter than all of 'em.

89
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,079
You don't have to be big
when you're smart, right?

90
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,213
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

91
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:24,722
You don't need
any of this nonsense, do you?

92
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,122
Here's what we're gonna do.

93
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,319
We're all gonna go out of town
this weekend and celebrate.

94
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:29,793
Some place fancy. Sound good?

95
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,524
- Sure.
- All right. Go get washed up.

96
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,158
I'll have Jimmy pour you something
to take the sting away. Go on.

97
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:37,627
Hey, Stuey...

98
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,639
This was special.

99
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,471
But you don't come down here
unless I bring you, okay? I mean it.

100
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,205
Yeah, no,
I'm talking to my kid.

101
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,771
My kid. My kid. He just kicked
the Sheinberg kid in the balls.

102
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,147
Yeah, you hope he don't kick
you in the balls.

103
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:54,482
Oh, you don't have any balls.
Yeah, I knew that.

104
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:17,071
You should know.

105
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,201
He's a good boy.

106
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:51,968
Sure you wanna do that?

107
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,437
You talk too much, shrimp.

108
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:58,245
Okay...just asking.

109
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:03,953
Gin.

110
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,426
Woo!

111
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:22,438
It's like I already knew
how to play.

112
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:26,171
My mom stanted to teach me.
she let me watch. but I knew.

113
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,643
I knew how they fit...
how they felt.

114
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,681
More like a mouth.

115
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,558
You know cards
were invented in China?

116
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:48,599
First they invented paper,
then cards right after.

117
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:52,337
Not these, though.
These came from England later.

118
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:54,600
That's why there's a Queen,
you know.

119
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:59,707
Four suits of 1 3 cards.

120
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,041
It's just...

121
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,643
...magic. It's perfect.

122
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:08,084
The Devil's work.

123
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:09,553
Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,581
But God, too.

125
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,430
Let's go to work.

126
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:30,706
Hello, everybody. I brought
my twin brother from Jersey.

127
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:32,108
We'll see you inside.

128
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:39,215
I wasn't really allowed
to go to the club.

129
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:43,779
But sometimes. when Ma was visiting
her sister or something. I got to go.

130
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:49,089
At night...
there was no place like it.

131
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:51,756
Hi, folks. Everything okay?
The martinis good?

132
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,331
God bless you.
Nice to see you.

133
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,230
Welcome. Welcome.
This is Stuey, my son.

134
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,394
Senator, how are you?
So nice to see you...

135
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:59,368
Pop was a big man there.

136
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,999
Everyone shook his hand--
Jews and Italians.

137
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:04,737
Brooklyn Moe Weinstein.
Big Anthony Tontolla.

138
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,302
Jackie Nose.
Bad Phillie Broma.

139
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,872
even celebrities
that came down sometimes--everybody.

140
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,783
Most of the time there.
I felt dizzy. I couldn't breathe.

141
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:17,380
It was so much...
bigger than everything else.

142
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:19,322
He's my bodyguard.
I brought him along.

143
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,024
I mean. broads. booze.
gambling--all of it.

144
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,929
But they never got sloppy. Ever.

145
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:30,059
And they took exactly zero shit
from nobody.

146
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,501
None of this corporate
political bullshit.

147
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:35,302
If they liked you. you were in.
If not. you were fucked.

148
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,038
Not like now.
Like you company muscle guys. right?

149
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:40,602
Not my style.

150
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,649
Martini time

151
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:48,119
I'm lining up my straws

152
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:50,619
So they liked you ?

153
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:52,716
Shit. yeah.

154
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,852
They saw I could play cards.
so I played for them.

155
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,862
The fish never saw me coming.
Never forgot me. either.

156
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:04,732
I razzed them so bad.
they always came back.

157
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,773
Vince and the other guys--
they respected me for my talent.

158
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,569
Don't work that way no more.

159
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,670
It's not so different now. Stuey.

160
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:19,377
When I was bar mitzvah'd in '66.
they all came. Every one.

161
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,944
They all gave me cash--
three grand. Out of respect.

162
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,252
You gonna tell me
it happens that way now?

163
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:30,586
Yeah. You give respect.
you get respect.

164
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:32,153
I gave respect.

165
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,558
What'd you do
with the money. Stuey?

166
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:38,133
I don't remember.

167
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,101
Yeah. you do.

168
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,240
No, Maxwell!
You're gonna kill him!

169
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,642
That's what I should do, Flo,
after what he did!

170
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,374
That was your bar mitzvah money,
you little shit!

171
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:51,212
- You spit on tradition!
- No!

172
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,445
I'm sorry, Pop.
I didn't mean--!

173
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,612
You didn't mean?
You didn't mean?!

174
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,019
Let me tell you what I mean.

175
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,025
From now on, no more club,
no more cards, no more track,

176
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:01,754
no more nothing,
you understand?!

177
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,686
You go to school,
you come home.

178
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:06,254
You use that big brain of yours

179
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,925
to do something other than
embarrass me and your mother,

180
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,502
you understand me?!

181
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:11,934
Vincent wants me to--

182
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:19,734
That's right, run away, you little shit.
Don't let me catch you!

183
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:23,239
What?!

184
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,551
He-Hey! There's my little genius.

185
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,256
Jesus Christ.

186
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:43,999
Who did this to you?

187
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,087
It's in your religion.

188
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,286
You understand my emphasis?

189
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,531
You really
wanna play cards, Stuey?

190
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,436
Yeah. More than anything.

191
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:32,146
All right.
I'll take care of it.

192
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,645
Let's go get a steak
for that shiner.

193
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,455
Good. 'Cause this credit thing...
it's for losers.

194
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,041
Stuey. Come here, son.

195
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:12,581
I'm sorry I was late, Pop.

196
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:16,491
Ralph's dad got a new color TV,
and we were watching, um...

197
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:50,660
My son the doctor,
driving up in his new Cadillac,

198
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:53,891
visiting us
from his house in Connecticut.

199
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,157
You think I wouldn't do it
another way if I could?!

200
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:30,291
I'm not smart enough!

201
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:37,607
I hate school.
It's boring!

202
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:40,007
And you don't like baseball,
you don't like football,

203
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:53,781
- Leave mom out of this!
- She doesn't see!

204
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:57,453
What--that you sit down at the club
and take these guys' money and respect

205
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,928
and then you spit on them
behind their backs?

206
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:01,464
No, she doesn't see!

207
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,628
Or someone did.

208
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,762
Everyone needs partners, man.

209
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:15,086
Where you been, Stuey?
I've been waiting for two fucking hours.

210
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:18,088
Jesus Christ.

211
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:21,689
Your dick is gonna fall off
if you keep going to them places.

212
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:23,825
- Where this time?
- Dolly's.

213
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,529
Skanks.
Victoria's is better.

214
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:27,764
You wanna go?

215
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:30,898
Nah, I don't wanna go.
Vince is gonna be mad as it is.

216
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:33,136
The game was supposed
to start an hour ago.

217
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,474
So? We still gotta eat, though,
don't we?

218
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:38,037
I guess so.

219
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,605
Whose is this?

220
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:41,173
Teddy's.

221
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,343
Teddy's?

222
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:56,232
And they look forward
to the trip.

223
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:58,365
Unbelievable.

224
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,428
Listen...

225
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:03,935
Vincent wanted me
to speak to you.

226
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:13,973
Tommy Spinotti,
Carmine Frangine--

227
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:15,518
Carmine's a prick.

228
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:30,664
and then you'll run off to the track or find
some asshole bookie to take your bet.

229
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:39,239
Okay, Anthony. Okay.

230
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:51,018
Flaming Christ, Anthony!

231
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:00,456
Absolutely, Mr. Leo.

232
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:02,590
Hi, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Leo.

233
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:10,705
So, shall we begin?
I believe knock rummy is the game?

234
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,399
What would you like
to play for, kid?

235
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,369
Anything you want.

236
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:44,202
Two bucks a point,
500 a game too much?

237
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:12,688
I'm rolling the dice

238
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:14,924
Feeling pretty good

239
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:53,196
Nice run of luck there, kid.

240
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:55,336
Oh, it ain't luck.

241
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:58,103
What, then?

242
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:59,506
I know you.

243
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:01,407
You know me?

244
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,181
Yeah, but I know now.

245
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:10,749
After four discards?

246
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:12,152
Impossible.

247
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:26,297
Well, I know you got
a pretty decent hand

248
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,703
'cause you always lean a little forward
when the cards look good on the deal.

249
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:37,637
Since I got the queen of diamonds,
you got kings.

250
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:52,461
until you hit something else
and you move 'em over.

251
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:54,019
Now, that's interesting, right?

252
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,809
No.

253
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,938
No, I don't think so, Mr. Leo.

254
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:08,002
Oh.

255
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:16,643
Oh, and, uh...

256
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:19,812
if you ever get to Vegas,
look me up.

257
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:38,565
So you're laying ten Gs
against 66 hundred to make that call.

258
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:40,899
Yeah, but I had him.

259
00:27:40,971 --> 00:27:43,030
I call right, he's destroyed.

260
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,671
If you could take a man out,
you do it.

261
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:54,377
What'd he do to you?

262
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:56,385
Nothing.

263
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:03,584
Yeah.

264
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:38,092
- Well--
- No, they don't. 'Cause they got class.

265
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:52,069
Look at that jacket.

266
00:28:52,142 --> 00:28:53,973
Like you've never been
in one before.

267
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:03,163
No, sir.

268
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,904
Good.
Because they spread disease.

269
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:03,064
Give young Stu here my food.

270
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:07,236
He's going to be
a millionaire, you know.

271
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:35,693
Don't let him near Funzi Giacomo
or the other families.

272
00:32:49,946 --> 00:32:51,607
Gratzi.

273
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:15,528
Just another $2 whore,
eh, Stuey?

274
00:34:04,454 --> 00:34:05,614
Gimme a dime.

275
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:08,681
...six--I don't have change.
Seven...eight...

276
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:10,316
Give me a fucking dime, Anthony.

277
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:30,137
four...five...six...

278
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:05,372
Sixteen...

279
00:35:05,448 --> 00:35:07,848
Yeah.
Oh, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

280
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:13,613
Yeah?

281
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:17,926
Okay. Uh, great. Um...

282
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:19,154
Friday?

283
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:22,889
7:30?

284
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:24,627
Great. Okay.

285
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:32,203
Okay, great.
I'll see you then.

286
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:33,435
All right, bye.

287
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:20,582
A king.

288
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:25,585
Now he's smiling real big,
he's relaxing, lights a cigar.

289
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:31,365
- The whole place goes berserk.
- No! What did he do?

290
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:34,662
He turned white as a sheet,

291
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,875
He died right there.

292
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:44,308
Oh, my God. Really?

293
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:53,952
Um, sir, about the wine,
my manager...

294
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:56,116
Do you possibly have
any identification?

295
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,023
A driver's license, perhaps?

296
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:11,765
Well, I don't drive,

297
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:34,957
You think?

298
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,227
Bad day.

299
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:52,177
You know, people coming and going,
winning, losing...

300
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:57,116
Yeah, exactly.

301
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:59,414
This is me.

302
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:06,715
Yeah, I talked to fucking Vincent,
you Jew bastard.

303
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:18,394
Carmine, let's go.

304
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:21,860
One of these days...

305
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:25,533
and with you,
it's just a matter of time.

306
00:39:25,608 --> 00:39:29,442
There ain't gonna be
no Vincent...no Gus.

307
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:37,916
...we're gonna have
a nice long dance.

308
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:39,648
Oh, yeah.

309
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,750
We will.

310
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,400
Want some coffee?

311
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:17,557
And they lived
happily ever after.

312
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,581
But it wasn't enough?

313
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:45,849
Hey, nobody gets everything they need
from one person.

314
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:08,307
So why'd she ask?

315
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:11,806
So he could tell her
what she wanted to hear.

316
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:14,978
And she could be with him.

317
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:31,126
Okay, good. Here.
Hold on one second.

318
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:42,104
Yeah, it's Stuey.

319
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:45,579
Uh, could you set us up with a couple
of spaghetti and meatballs--two orders.

320
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:54,180
What was that?

321
00:41:54,257 --> 00:41:56,589
- Joey's. I ordered for us.
- You ordered?

322
00:42:16,646 --> 00:42:18,705
Maybe I'll be there
when you get back.

323
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:21,045
We'll do it tomorrow,
I promise. Okay?

324
00:42:21,117 --> 00:42:24,280
Just you and me.
Real romantic-like. I promise.

325
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:35,596
I don't like this, Stuey.

326
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:51,705
This ain't like usual.

327
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:00,951
He wouldn't give it to me.
He said you owe him.

328
00:43:01,023 --> 00:43:02,285
Rosco, then?

329
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:03,347
No.

330
00:43:03,426 --> 00:43:04,484
Freddie.

331
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,027
No!

332
00:43:06,863 --> 00:43:07,921
Who, then?

333
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,235
Gus won't cover us if we lose.

334
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:55,204
I should've told you.

335
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,841
Why don't you get out of here.

336
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:44,782
They broke Anthony's arm.

337
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,452
- You think this is a fucking game?
- Jesus.

338
00:45:02,878 --> 00:45:04,641
Yes, you will.

339
00:45:04,714 --> 00:45:06,875
You're going
to Las Vegas tonight.

340
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:08,007
Tonight?

341
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:09,876
But Angela--

342
00:45:09,952 --> 00:45:11,112
Fuck Angela.

343
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:13,678
You don't even know when your life's
being saved, so shut the fuck up.

344
00:45:18,794 --> 00:45:21,729
Every penny comes back here,
you understand?

345
00:45:21,797 --> 00:45:23,458
Every fucking penny.

346
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,722
Come on, Gino.
Please.

347
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:34,733
Okay, Stuey. Sure.

348
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:51,177
Shit.

349
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:09,253
You have a wonderful evening, sir.

350
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:11,526
And if you wanna go anywhere,
ask for Gerald.

351
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,261
Okay, Gerry. I'll do that.

352
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:16,669
Welcome to Las Vegas, sir.

353
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:17,797
Thank you.

354
00:48:19,141 --> 00:48:20,199
Thank you.

355
00:48:25,548 --> 00:48:26,879
Me and Frank.

356
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:31,283
Best in the business--best in the world,
as far as I'm concerned.

357
00:48:31,353 --> 00:48:34,345
They got a couple of guys making
some noise now up and down the strip,

358
00:48:34,423 --> 00:48:37,415
but...it won't be the same.

359
00:48:50,706 --> 00:48:52,537
Some kind of player,
this boy.

360
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,102
Listen, Stu...

361
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:11,384
if I even hear you're near
any one of them before the tournament...

362
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:04,144
ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

363
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:06,807
and welcome little Stuey Ungar!

364
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:13,112
You sure you're old enough
to win this, kid?

365
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,454
Anthony. Jeez, man.

366
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:56,554
- Hello?
- Um.

367
00:50:57,232 --> 00:50:58,221
Sondra.

368
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,996
Yeah, Sondra, listen. I gotta take care
of some business, okay?

369
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:16,444
They're like fucking sharks around here.
They smell blood in the water.

370
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:59,424
Cops came....firemen.
Everything.

371
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:00,985
Big scene.

372
00:52:16,412 --> 00:52:18,573
You could do this, Stuey.

373
00:52:56,785 --> 00:52:58,275
I'm funny?

374
00:53:06,295 --> 00:53:07,956
gone back to New York,

375
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,522
gotten a job as an accountant
or some shit, made my apologies.

376
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:24,637
No! No!
For leaving the goddamn table!

377
00:53:24,713 --> 00:53:26,544
This was what I was meant to do.

378
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:28,947
This was where I
was supposed to be.

379
00:53:29,017 --> 00:53:32,145
Movie stars in Hollywood,
politicians in Washington.

380
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:45,990
I promised myself I wasn't
gonna gamble no more, and I didn't.

381
00:53:46,068 --> 00:53:48,002
I really didn't.
For a long time, I didn't.

382
00:54:45,928 --> 00:54:49,125
and the casinos edge on the game
just whittles it away.

383
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:52,929
Sometimes it's just a tiny edge.
but it's always there.

384
00:54:56,638 --> 00:54:59,129
so they buy you your room
and your dinner.

385
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:01,870
and they smile and wait for you
to lay your money down again

386
00:55:04,313 --> 00:55:06,144
And that's what we did. too.

387
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:07,807
Just waited forya.

388
00:55:48,857 --> 00:55:52,190
You get two private cards.
five others are dealt up.

389
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:08,107
'Cause these donkeys never figured out
that the game wasn't about cards.

390
00:56:14,816 --> 00:56:16,408
It was about people.

391
00:56:16,485 --> 00:56:17,645
Re-raise.

392
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:45,011
I gotta bet you 5,000, Mario.

393
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:42,400
That one.

394
00:57:42,471 --> 00:57:43,631
This one?

395
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,649
You lucky bastard.

396
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,059
Nice draw.

397
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:42,621
Hey!

398
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:56,867
In golf. you could do that.

399
00:58:57,412 --> 00:59:00,472
He's got about 1 80 yards
to the pin.

400
00:59:29,311 --> 00:59:31,302
And this certainly is anywhere.

401
01:00:01,276 --> 01:00:02,641
You'll drown!

402
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:31,933
He hits the ball off this huge tee
three feet from the fucking cup.

403
01:01:01,336 --> 01:01:03,668
Five fucking months!

404
01:01:03,738 --> 01:01:06,138
People stood six-deep to watch.

405
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:25,116
It was the fuckin'
World Series of Poker.

406
01:01:25,193 --> 01:01:27,855
and either you had the chops
to win a bracelet. or you didn't.

407
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:55,215
Tell me I'm learning

408
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,660
I call.

409
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:18,076
But I don't walk on water
and I don't read minds

410
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:33,823
Yeah, it's just
a matter of time

411
01:03:14,302 --> 01:03:16,099
When you made
the final table...

412
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:27,030
Listen, I'm gonna go
to my room and lie down.

413
01:04:27,108 --> 01:04:28,268
Okay. I'll--

414
01:05:45,135 --> 01:05:46,295
Stuey.

415
01:06:07,524 --> 01:06:08,957
Hand-made.

416
01:06:09,025 --> 01:06:10,754
You and those cards.

417
01:06:11,628 --> 01:06:12,822
We all knew it.

418
01:06:28,912 --> 01:06:30,311
I have to get home.

419
01:06:40,824 --> 01:06:42,155
change is good.

420
01:06:42,893 --> 01:06:44,053
It looks like.

421
01:07:49,459 --> 01:07:51,393
I need to wash these windows.

422
01:07:59,903 --> 01:08:02,633
He's, uh...really smart.

423
01:08:04,107 --> 01:08:05,165
Tall.

424
01:08:10,113 --> 01:08:13,207
I got a million bucks
in a vault at the Dunes.

425
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:38,767
Anything.

426
01:09:03,733 --> 01:09:04,995
In Vegas?

427
01:09:06,736 --> 01:09:08,897
For Vegas, it was a normal life.

428
01:09:19,849 --> 01:09:21,510
- Thank you.
- I'll be downstairs.

429
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:48,570
I'm gonna go look at this house.

430
01:11:13,596 --> 01:11:15,427
- Glass of wine.
- Okay.

431
01:11:33,149 --> 01:11:35,549
You get married,
you get soft.

432
01:12:04,147 --> 01:12:06,911
But there is a matter
of a down payment.

433
01:12:06,983 --> 01:12:08,644
Yeah, 40K, right?
Here you go.

434
01:12:38,114 --> 01:12:39,103
Stu.

435
01:12:39,182 --> 01:12:40,672
What? What?
Everything okay?

436
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:41,808
Yeah.

437
01:12:41,885 --> 01:12:43,045
Yeah?

438
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:45,053
Salmon or Hunter Green?

439
01:12:45,121 --> 01:12:46,247
What?

440
01:12:46,322 --> 01:12:47,653
I think Salmon.

441
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,927
Stuey, you haven't spent
one second in the new house,

442
01:13:00,069 --> 01:13:01,798
and I have made
every decision, all right?

443
01:13:11,815 --> 01:13:14,875
So paint the fucking thing
Day-Glo Purple, for all I care.

444
01:13:14,951 --> 01:13:16,942
Just leave me
the fuck alone, all right?

445
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:11,504
I'm gonna put it in the bank
and give it to my kid--what else?

446
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,615
Then why'd you say that?

447
01:14:21,684 --> 01:14:23,174
I was kidding.

448
01:14:35,265 --> 01:14:39,326
Great house, cars, vacations...

449
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:41,728
And Nicky.

450
01:14:41,804 --> 01:14:43,669
Your daughter.

451
01:14:51,981 --> 01:14:53,312
No.

452
01:14:55,685 --> 01:14:57,516
It's the most amazing thing.

453
01:14:58,988 --> 01:15:00,649
You don't sound amazed.

454
01:15:01,391 --> 01:15:02,517
Yeah.

455
01:15:04,327 --> 01:15:08,525
See, a kid is you...
perfect.

456
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:35,448
Stuey!

457
01:15:47,437 --> 01:15:48,768
- How ya doing?
- Good.

458
01:15:48,838 --> 01:15:51,329
Listen, go see if Scout
has enough water, okay?

459
01:15:51,407 --> 01:15:53,136
- Okay.
- All right.

460
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,119
- I don't know.
- How 'bout raw? Think he'll like that?

461
01:16:05,188 --> 01:16:07,213
How 'bout Susan?

462
01:16:12,762 --> 01:16:15,925
And now they have to come back over
and turn it on--again.

463
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,934
And I have to call Susan
and make something up.

464
01:16:23,206 --> 01:16:25,902
No! That's not the way it works!

465
01:16:25,975 --> 01:16:29,467
We could put it on a credit card,
but we don't have a credit card.

466
01:16:49,499 --> 01:16:51,558
You know, sometimes you can be
a real cunt, Angie.

467
01:16:56,539 --> 01:16:58,530
Sometimes you make me
fucking sick.

468
01:17:21,664 --> 01:17:24,895
You should've seen that fucking guy's
face, man. He was scared shit.

469
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,867
Aren't we havin'
a fucking party, or what?

470
01:17:32,942 --> 01:17:35,274
Yeah!

471
01:17:41,517 --> 01:17:42,848
Look, I gotta go, okay?

472
01:17:42,919 --> 01:17:44,910
Oh, come on.
We're just getting started here, DJ.

473
01:17:44,987 --> 01:17:46,978
No, man. I'm done.

474
01:18:01,504 --> 01:18:03,665
So, Stu--can I call you Stu?

475
01:18:03,739 --> 01:18:05,070
Yeah, sure.

476
01:18:05,141 --> 01:18:08,577
So, Stu, have you met
the lovely Sondra?

477
01:18:42,011 --> 01:18:44,172
We could settle up later,
okay, Stu?

478
01:18:44,247 --> 01:18:45,373
Yeah, sure.

479
01:18:46,249 --> 01:18:47,580
Thanks, Tony.

480
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:03,597
No fun at all.

481
01:19:04,467 --> 01:19:05,866
What, home?! Oh...

482
01:19:26,489 --> 01:19:29,322
Like you'd think she had a shitty life
or something like that.

483
01:19:29,392 --> 01:19:32,987
Like she didn't live in a fucking mansion
that I bought for her. She's like--

484
01:19:33,062 --> 01:19:35,792
- Ungrateful.
- Yes. Yes. Exactly that.

485
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:37,992
She's fucking ungrateful. Here.

486
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:39,959
Here. Look.

487
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,671
- Stuey.
- Right there.

488
01:19:45,741 --> 01:19:46,901
- Stuey.
- You're happy, right?

489
01:19:46,976 --> 01:19:48,409
You're thrilled, right?

490
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:08,793
Why should you?
You got 30 grand right there.

491
01:20:08,864 --> 01:20:12,027
With her, it's fucking different
'cause that shit is not important.

492
01:20:19,742 --> 01:20:23,234
Not that she hasn't smacked me.
No, that's okay, I guess. I don't know.

493
01:20:23,312 --> 01:20:26,975
There's a different standard.
There's a double standard there. Why?

494
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,832
Angie wouldn't
even touch me by then.

495
01:20:46,902 --> 01:20:50,303
But you didn't really mind.
You had two new mistresses.

496
01:21:25,374 --> 01:21:27,865
But I don't wanna talk
about this no more.

497
01:21:28,678 --> 01:21:30,202
Go on, Stuey.

498
01:21:32,081 --> 01:21:33,571
We need this.

499
01:22:09,485 --> 01:22:11,043
Oh, Bob, go fuck yourself, okay?

500
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,417
Security!

501
01:22:12,488 --> 01:22:13,546
Get him out.

502
01:22:13,622 --> 01:22:14,987
Why don't you just fucking kiss me, okay,

503
01:22:15,057 --> 01:22:17,082
because you've been
fucking me all night, anyway.

504
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:18,592
Who the fuck you think you are...

505
01:22:52,061 --> 01:22:53,153
Angie?

506
01:23:21,023 --> 01:23:22,684
What the fuck is going on?

507
01:23:57,126 --> 01:23:59,390
Don't fucking tell me this.

508
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:03,387
Don't you fucking tell me this.

509
01:24:04,467 --> 01:24:07,061
Motherfucker!

510
01:24:07,136 --> 01:24:09,297
You motherfucker!

511
01:24:11,373 --> 01:24:12,635
Huh?!

512
01:24:22,017 --> 01:24:24,679
Huh? You fucking miserable cunt!

513
01:24:24,753 --> 01:24:26,584
That's what you're gonna do?!

514
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:35,820
Yes, it's me.

515
01:24:35,898 --> 01:24:39,334
I know. I know.
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

516
01:24:48,511 --> 01:24:49,910
Okay.

517
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:51,241
Yeah.

518
01:24:58,287 --> 01:25:01,222
You miserable cunt bitch!
Fuck it!

519
01:25:36,926 --> 01:25:39,087
I don't remember, DJ.
I don't.

520
01:25:50,005 --> 01:25:52,667
Hey ,fuck you, man, okay?
I don't need any lectures right now.

521
01:25:58,414 --> 01:26:00,405
You like that, Stuey? Huh?

522
01:26:00,482 --> 01:26:01,972
Well, you better get used
to it, man.

523
01:27:07,616 --> 01:27:12,019
Well, I haven't been in this room
since, uh, Susan left.

524
01:27:53,996 --> 01:27:56,590
Yeah, one thing at a time,
okay, DJ?

525
01:27:56,665 --> 01:27:59,133
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Okay.

526
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:03,169
These okay?

527
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:05,900
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Wait a minute. Hold on. I...

528
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:11,202
Susan always, uh...

529
01:28:15,584 --> 01:28:17,245
She thought of everything, huh?

530
01:28:19,354 --> 01:28:20,616
Yeah, she did.

531
01:29:16,345 --> 01:29:17,835
Not today, brother.

532
01:29:19,715 --> 01:29:20,977
Not today.

533
01:29:30,959 --> 01:29:32,893
Good morning!

534
01:30:00,088 --> 01:30:06,084
Tonight I kinda lost myself
in a moment of a year

535
01:30:24,179 --> 01:30:29,173
To take away
yesterday's sorrow

536
01:30:40,062 --> 01:30:45,762
To take away
yesterday's sorrow

537
01:31:29,244 --> 01:31:33,704
To take away
yesterday's sorrow

538
01:32:10,886 --> 01:32:14,879
Send them angels

539
01:32:22,431 --> 01:32:23,591
It's good!

540
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,094
No shit.
It's really good!

541
01:33:10,278 --> 01:33:12,109
But I'll get to see Nicky.

542
01:33:41,777 --> 01:33:43,711
We sure fucked it up,
didn't we?

543
01:33:54,556 --> 01:33:58,549
You know...if I'd have known
about corned beef earlier,

544
01:34:42,104 --> 01:34:44,504
Come on, kid.
Get in.

545
01:35:29,651 --> 01:35:32,415
Where's your competitive spirit?

546
01:35:33,221 --> 01:35:35,815
I know, I know, I know.
You're worried about the money.

547
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:38,952
No, you wouldn't do that.
Of course not.

548
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,841
You're my player, all right?

549
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:02,577
I gotta think about that.

550
01:36:11,126 --> 01:36:12,957
And he wanna think about it?

551
01:36:20,602 --> 01:36:22,331
Well, thanks for the ride.

552
01:36:23,505 --> 01:36:25,666
Oh...my pleasure.

553
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,399
Those are for me, huh?

554
01:37:48,456 --> 01:37:50,856
You used to try and get me
to come out here, remember?

555
01:37:51,826 --> 01:37:52,884
Yeah.

556
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:06,031
She's a lot like you.

557
01:38:06,107 --> 01:38:08,098
- Oh, shit.
- No.

558
01:38:08,176 --> 01:38:09,438
In a good way.

559
01:38:13,114 --> 01:38:17,983
We're, uh...we're gonna be
moving back, Stuey. I got a job.

560
01:38:22,257 --> 01:38:23,849
Doesn't change anything.

561
01:38:29,264 --> 01:38:30,322
Well...

562
01:38:31,433 --> 01:38:32,491
See ya.

563
01:38:39,507 --> 01:38:40,974
I don't know.

564
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,815
It'll bring you luck at the series.

565
01:38:58,993 --> 01:39:00,790
Bye.

566
01:39:00,862 --> 01:39:01,920
Nicky.

567
01:39:07,469 --> 01:39:10,529
You can't lose--
not with me around.

568
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:17,801
And as aggressive
as Stuey has been throughout,

569
01:39:17,879 --> 01:39:21,371
here he comes again--
he raises $40,000.

570
01:39:23,585 --> 01:39:27,077
Stu raised seven times in a row
with no one calling him?

571
01:39:27,155 --> 01:39:28,622
Is he bluffing?

572
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:36,954
No one was willing to be the one
to pay to find out if Stu was bluffing.

573
01:39:49,577 --> 01:39:51,738
Well, that's no help for Stu,

574
01:39:51,813 --> 01:39:55,408
because he needs a four
or a deuce on the final card

575
01:40:19,207 --> 01:40:24,144
But wherever you are.
you gotta consider all your outs.

576
01:40:25,146 --> 01:40:28,309
See. sometimes they save you...

577
01:40:31,052 --> 01:40:33,577
you really ain't got no outs at all.

578
01:41:17,098 --> 01:41:18,258
Again.

579
01:41:20,301 --> 01:41:21,962
A bona fide legend.

580
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:23,862
Oh, yeah.

581
01:41:25,073 --> 01:41:27,064
Everybody's hero.

582
01:41:27,141 --> 01:41:28,369
Uh-huh.

583
01:41:36,784 --> 01:41:39,719
Oh, all the time, man.
They're always keeping me straight.

584
01:41:39,787 --> 01:41:41,948
See, that's the great thing
about Vegas.

585
01:41:42,023 --> 01:41:45,982
Is--is people are always
doing favors for each other.

586
01:42:40,148 --> 01:42:42,082
So you got where you've seen me?

587
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:51,309
You did good anyway.

588
01:43:52,387 --> 01:43:53,445
Really?

589
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:03,724
We could play a couple of hands
for, you know...
