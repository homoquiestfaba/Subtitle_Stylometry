1
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,244
Feb. 16th

2
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:43,048
Woke up with the usual headache -
another bad night.

3
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,489
A bad dream about an unsuccessful
experiment with tablets.

4
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:53,395
The uncertainty of the situation
caused excruciating pain.

5
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,330
Nov. 8th:

6
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,700
Coffee with Elsa, an informative
conversation about her family...

7
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,502
including criminal members.

8
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,476
Genetics isn't
empty madness after all.

9
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,972
Oct. 20th:

10
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:14,280
Repulsive essays
about Germany's past.

11
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,378
Truths, half-truths, lies...

12
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,755
Natural and cultural history
made easy.

13
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:26,765
German history hacked up
into flippant journalist jargon...

14
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,769
Fried into smug burgers.

15
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:39,004
The only great Germans were
Heine, Freud, Marx

16
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,103
and a few other names.

17
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,530
Are you deaf?

18
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,382
Said thanks.

19
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:24,278
Ezer Mahmud's job was selling
heroin in schoolyards in our city.

20
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,915
His motives are inexcusable.

21
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,621
It was pure personal profit
and cringing to orders.

22
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,093
Propose a sentence of 4 years.

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,102
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,229
Thank you, prosecutor.

25
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,773
Does the defense wish to interrupt?
- No, why'?

26
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:49,173
“Cringing to orders"
Duckmausertum.

27
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,808
Does that word exist
in any other language?

28
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,752
Like 'staying clean' -
Only Germans can do that.

29
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,551
Mr. Rohm, enough.
Make your point.

30
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:04,083
Want to explain how my
client managed to stay clean,

31
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,993
yet failed as a person.

32
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,027
Leave me alone.
 can get out on my own.

33
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,230
Get the stuff out
of the trunk.

34
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,147
Does he live here?
- No.

35
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,150
Why's he sneaking around here?
- No idea.

36
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,847
He really doesn't know?

37
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,887
No, it's a surprise.
 didn't say a thing.

38
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:35,019
When's he coming?
- When he's finished at court.

39
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,589
Mahmud was only
given two years.

40
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,689
There was a drug death
last night downtown.

41
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,234
Can you still sleep in peace?
- Ask the judge, not me.

42
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,134
Didn't sentence him.
- Why did you take on the defense?

43
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,070
Told you - I'm a lawyer.

44
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,039
How's your book
about Mengele coming along?

45
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,306
It's coming out in January.
It's called One of Us.

46
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,369
We're almost finished
processing the final data.

47
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,076
Isn't that a bit provocative?
- don't think so.

48
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,415
Come from the same town as Mengele.
Somehow he was our neighbor.

49
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,046
He could've come from here.
That's the point, isn't it?

50
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,862
Hi, honey.

51
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,531
Hi, Mother!
- He knew all along! You told him!

52
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,477
Happy Birthday, Petzi.
 love you.

53
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,844
Don't call me Petzi.
 love you too.

54
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,942
Where are the presents?

55
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,780
Thanks, Mother.
But What is it?

56
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,156
Know it's a long Way off.

57
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,568
This is great, Hillmann.
Thanks.

58
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,542
Where did you get it?

59
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,969
Here.

60
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,843
Don't know that shop.
Rebecca, we have to go there.

61
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,977
This is the last one.
- Who's it from?

62
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,249
Don't know.
It was in front of the door.

63
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,223
The stork must have brought it.

64
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,288
Mother, it's your big day.
There's probably a baby inside.

65
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,987
Oh, my God.
Is it real?

66
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,554
There's very few left.

67
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,065
Most of them were burned
by their owners.

68
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,626
The badges of rank are missing.
You can still see the stitches.

69
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,865
Those things
had serial numbers

70
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,169
so they didn't get
mixed up at the cleaners.

71
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,141
Where?

72
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,670
Look inside the right cuff.

73
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,214
Weren't we celebrating
a birthday?

74
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,792
4-3-9-7.

75
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,091
It's incomplete.
Those are the last digits.

76
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,259
How about some wine'?

77
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,302
Thanks.
- need to make a call.

78
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,316
Daniel.
Peter, here.

79
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,912
Peter Rohm?
Is that you?

80
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,480
How are you?

81
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,287
Haven't heard from you
both for over half a year.

82
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,329
Thought you'd drowned in
paperwork like we are here.

83
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,160
How's Rebecca?
How's the book?

84
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,790
Good.

85
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,859
Listen, you must have registration
numbers for SS uniforms, right?

86
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,565
What do you think we do here?
Tell me.

87
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,472
Think it's only the last digits.
- What's the number?

88
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:15,570
4-3-9-7.
- 4-3-9-7.

89
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,414
Sounds like you have a new clue.
- Very likely.

90
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,218
Can you find anything?
- Wait.

91
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,228
Bingo, buddy.

92
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,567
Is that Mengele's uniform?
- It might be.

93
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,301
Where did you get that number?

94
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,309
From a uniform in front of me.

95
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,278
I'll be there tomorrow, all right?
- Sure!

96
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,941
See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

97
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,386
It might be.
- What?

98
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,458
Mengele's uniform.
It might be Mengele's uniform.

99
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,894
You know what?
You're possessed.

100
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,091
Do you know
What this means, Rebecca?

101
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,794
It could've been a nice evening.

102
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,701
It's a piece of old cloth.
It's not a holy relic.

103
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,672
If it's really his uniform
then it can Wait till tomorrow.

104
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,606
You're acting as if
it was your birthday.

105
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,972
Up yours!

106
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,511
But it's our book!

107
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,604
It's your book!
Just write it!

108
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,945
We researched it for years
the World over.

109
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,076
Won't let it become
our lifetime job!

110
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,848
What's stopping you
from Writing it?

111
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,793
Don't Wait for me.

112
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,261
Are you nuts?
You drove into me.

113
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,099
What is this shit?

114
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,273
Peter, What's Wrong?
- The asshole drove into me!

115
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,728
Stop, asshole.

116
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,744
What's this?

117
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,817
Hello!

118
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,117
Mr. Rohm.
Glad you could come.

119
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,784
What's this all about?
Who are you?

120
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,418
Call me Schmidt.
Is that acceptable?

121
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,759
Or how about Muller.
How do you like Muller?

122
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,663
Don't give a damn.

123
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,837
Oct. 27th, '89.
Dear Mrs. Holtz:

124
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,844
Unfortunately you still haven't
replied to my request to meet.

125
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,643
It would mean a lot to me to talk
to you about former classmates.

126
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:49,744
It would mean a lot to me to
talk to you about former neighbors,

127
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:55,521
former colleagues,
fellow students, etc.

128
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,262
Where did you get those letters?

129
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:04,401
Reputable citizens the country over
received them for the last 8 years.

130
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,403
Always the same sender.

131
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:13,138
Always requesting information
about a certain prominent person.

132
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,805
A hero of the last World War.

133
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,474
What do you want from me?

134
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,518
Why so many questions, Mr. Rohm?

135
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,517
Why are you possessed
by long-forgotten things?

136
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,323
Yes. think you'll do it.

137
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,726
Do what?

138
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,827
Hail Hitler, Mr. Rohm.

139
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,598
You're finally awake.

140
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:32,732
How are you?
Do you have a headache?

141
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,913
You're finally here.

142
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:51,526
I'm Job...
and you're my Redeemer.

143
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,670
It's a reprint of the so-called
Euthanasia <i>Bible</i> from 1920.

144
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,969
Destroying Unworthy <i>Lives.</i>
What's this all about?

145
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,636
The book's not important.

146
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,476
But the epilogue is.
Get it?

147
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,810
Not really.

148
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,181
It's a contemporary essay
Written by a British historian.

149
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,776
It's about Mengele.

150
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:21,882
Mengele merely practiced
euthanasia in Auschwitz.

151
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:27,329
An attempt to offer new arguments
for defenders of Auschwitz.

152
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:32,597
The sole German Mengele expert
disappears at the same time.

153
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,660
Do you see the connection now?

154
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,396
Mr. Ginsberg, by all due respect,

155
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,775
you and your club's congitive
tunnel vision surpasses our means.

156
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,178
What about the SS uniform?

157
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,614
Is that also a product of
cognitive tunnel vision?

158
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,812
Cut it out.
My husband's disappeared!

159
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,116
What are you going to do?

160
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:58,059
Believe me, there was ho
other Way to get you here.

161
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,396
You've researched for years...

162
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,200
trying to write
the ultimate book about Mengele.

163
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,868
But you never Wrote it.

164
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,467
Why not?

165
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,345
Which questions were you
unable to answer?

166
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,775
Now you can ask them.

167
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:28,391
If you think I'm a liar or crazy...

168
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,759
won't force you to stay here.

169
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,236
Go back to your wife
and your well-assorted archive

170
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:48,001
You didn't bring me here
to give me a ticket home.

171
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,310
Said...

172
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:57,013
Go or ask me.

173
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,859
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Peter Rohm?

174
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,836
My name is Geppert, LKA.
You're under arrest.

175
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:48,963
Please come with us.

176
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,029
Are you crazy?
 was kidnapped!

177
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,769
Don't Worry.
A mere formality.

178
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,008
Please come with us.

179
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,483
Baumgarten?
Mr. Heinz Baumgarten?

180
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,680
No. Mengele.

181
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,349
Dr. Josef Mengele.

182
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,124
That young man is Peter Rohm.

183
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,461
He'll represent me in court.

184
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,993
He's lying. He's lying!

185
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,537
Won't represent him!

186
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,401
That's the lawyer.

187
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,040
Wait outside.
I'll see you outside.

188
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,214
Think you owe me
an explanation.

189
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,051
Wrong.
Completely Wrong!

190
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,590
You owe us an explanation

191
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,853
I'm Heribert Voigt,
senior public prosecutor.

192
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,053
Yes, know.
- Dr. Meyer.

193
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,097
Please listen carefully.
 don't want to tell this twice.

194
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,898
36 hours ago, was drugged
and smuggled into Argentina.

195
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,668
There met Mr. Baumgarten
who talked confusedly for hours,

196
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,903
and then let me go.
Now I'm here.

197
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,446
It's the biggest farce
I've ever experienced.

198
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,880
The motives are
a total mystery to me.

199
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,009
Let me make myself clear.

200
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,543
Anything Mr. Baumgarten does, <i>says,</i>
or thinks has nothing to do with me.

201
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,612
Do you understand?
- Mr. Geppert.

202
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,449
Sit down.

203
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,699
An Argentinian passport from 1956:
Mengele, Josef.

204
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:31,138
A Paraguayian passport from 1959:
Mengele, Josef.

205
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:35,645
Here, the lab reports from Auschwitz.
All are authentic.

206
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,843
Mengele's signature.
Didn't they come from you?

207
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,712
This is the first time I've seen them.

208
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,757
You didn't happen to organize
the press outside either?

209
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,626
Weren't you listening?

210
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,994
Just explained was kidnapped.

211
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,001
My wife's Waited hours
for me outside and now--

212
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,901
Mr. Rohm, this isn't only
your nightmare - it's also mine.

213
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,530
I'm the senior prosecutor.

214
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,438
It could be the entire
nation's nightmare.

215
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,499
So do us a favor.
Don't play the diva!

216
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,944
Whether you like it or not,
you're in deep.

217
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,290
What is your name?
- Josef Mengele.

218
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,528
Your parents' names?
- Karl and Walburga Mengele.

219
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,630
Your first Wife's name?
- Irene Schonbein.

220
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:41,906
My family didn't like her.
She was too Protestant.

221
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,946
You have a comment?

222
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,079
Ask him about Muller or Schmidt,
not about his mother.

223
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,090
One thing after the other.

224
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,990
We're strictly following procedure.

225
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,922
Please turn the tape back on.

226
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,060
Am Josef Mengele.

227
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,126
These bones, as you call them,

228
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:12,608
belong to my cousin Gerard Sladky.
He drowned swimming in Brazil.

229
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,942
We resembled one another.

230
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:25,516
Gerard lived by his own
discretion in Sao Paulo.

231
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,285
Friends buried him...

232
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,954
in Embu after the accident.

233
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,362
Then they broke into my dentist...

234
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:41,166
exchanged his papers for mine,
and had my peace, initially.

235
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:47,304
When my pursuers were close
on my heels, these friends...

236
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:51,872
led the police
to Josef Mengele's grave.

237
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,417
The hunt was over.
It was that easy.

238
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,044
Where are your dental records?

239
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,988
At my dentist.
Where else?

240
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,958
If you want,
I'll give you his address.

241
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,861
But that's all I'm saying...

242
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,332
until I've spoken to my lawyer.

243
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,861
Go or ask me.

244
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,879
Why did he do it?

245
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,514
It was his duty -
as a person.

246
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,553
That's nonsense.

247
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:38,056
If you want
your questions answered...

248
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,996
then get off your high horse.

249
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,159
Act more modestly.

250
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:49,467
Let's assume he's taken
to court in Germany...

251
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,941
and you're his lawyer.

252
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,035
What would you do?

253
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,740
Wouldn't be his lawyer.
I'd be his prosecutor.

254
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,341
Then you'd be as dumb
and clever as ever.

255
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:09,223
If you treat every answer as a lie,
the question still remains.

256
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,194
So you'd be his defense.

257
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,094
How can anyone defend
someone like him?

258
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,155
See?

259
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,567
That's a more sensible question.

260
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,869
Let's assume he's still alive.

261
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,474
Let's assume...

262
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,275
he surrenders...

263
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:39,955
to the German authorities
in order to tell the truth...

264
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,992
his truth.

265
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,586
Doesn't he deserve
a good lawyer?

266
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,756
The best?

267
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,800
Deserve?

268
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,097
No. He'd be entitled to one.

269
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:02,040
Let's say theoretically
you were his lawyer.

270
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,882
What would you ask him?

271
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,878
I'd ask him:
Why did you do it?

272
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,955
Yes.

273
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,394
Why...

274
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,276
I'm Mrs. Rohm
and want to see my husband.

275
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,643
Can't tell you anything else.

276
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,014
My husband is being held
Without a Warrant.

277
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,314
Didn't think that was possible
in our constitutional state.

278
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,482
Maybe your husband volunteered
to help the authorities.

279
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,254
After all, he found Josef Mengele.

280
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,785
My husband is not there by choice.
And Mengele is dead.

281
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,132
Of course know Mr. Rohm.

282
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,169
I'm a publisher, he's ah author.
Naturally we know one another.

283
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,434
I'm not an author, I'm a lawyer!
He kidnapped me!

284
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,566
Did not.

285
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,571
Do you know Heinz Baumgarten?

286
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,772
Never heard of him.

287
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:14,282
Is it true plane tickets to
Buenos Aires were booked in your name?

288
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,545
Yes.

289
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,111
Asked Mr. Rohm to research locally,
which he did successfully.

290
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:23,148
He's twisting the facts!
 Wasn't there voluntarily!

291
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,352
Mr. Rohm, don't be silly.

292
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,726
<i>Kiss my ass!
What a farce!</i>

293
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:33,430
No one in the Dept. of the Interior
wants to commit right now.

294
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:38,270
The public prosecutor denies
Josef Mengele's proven identity.

295
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,642
Experts will be presented
with a DNA analysis today.

296
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:46,672
The Israeli government
has requested extradition.

297
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,582
German officials are currently
examining this request.

298
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,282
The World is Watching our nation.

299
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,588
See the minimal difference
in the arched line.

300
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:03,392
A normal development
over the years.

301
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,436
Professor, we need results.

302
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,602
If it's a fake...

303
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,609
it's the best I've ever seen.

304
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:19,547
The dental records
need to be compared.

305
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:23,711
The story with the cousin
could be true.

306
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,686
The aim:

307
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:30,056
to compare exactly defined
facial points...

308
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,562
measuring every difference.

309
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,827
An X-ray of Baumgarten's skull.

310
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:40,927
How many measurable
differences are there?

311
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,903
Didn't find any.

312
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,464
Otherwise we'd all
be home by now.

313
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,447
Ladies and gentlemen...

314
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,744
What choice do we have?

315
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,851
Please unlock it.

316
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,557
Josef Mengele?

317
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,841
Dr. Josef Mengele.

318
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,275
I'm the investigating magistrate,
Ewald Kurten.

319
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,902
You're under arrest.

320
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,609
Plead not guilty,
Your Honor.

321
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,380
That's not the issue here.

322
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,513
You are in custody
pending trial.

323
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,217
You have the right
to a public defender.

324
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,351
My defense is Peter Rohm.

325
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,021
Please inform him
that wish to speak to him

326
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,705
ID, please.

327
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,070
Over to the Wall.

328
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,142
Hands up.

329
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,545
Clean.

330
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,435
So you came.

331
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,207
Won't take on your case

332
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,601
Why not?

333
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,872
Know too much about you.

334
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,914
Then Why are you here?

335
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,643
Voigt asked me.

336
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,015
What do you owe Voigt?

337
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,856
Why me?

338
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,552
Because you're
a renowned lawyer...

339
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,959
No, not at all.

340
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:51,990
Because you want to be one
of those rare specimens...

341
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,596
an honest person.

342
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,233
Thank you.

343
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,006
Want to tell you something.

344
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:05,741
Only came back
for one reason:

345
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,411
To tell my story.
The whole story.

346
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,819
What exactly did
in Auschwitz and Why.

347
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,357
No one's ever done that.

348
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,394
Josef Mengele's not the type to
come back 50 years later to confess.

349
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:24,831
Not to confess.
To tell the truth.

350
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,738
The whole truth?
The selections?

351
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:29,931
The excessive acts?

352
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,032
<i>The senseless,
sadistic pseudo-experiments?</i>

353
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,076
Mengele doesn't deny anything.

354
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,013
You mean he'd take
responsibility for all these crimes?

355
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,046
Crimes?

356
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,145
You call those crimes?

357
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,020
How else would you call it?

358
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,355
Compassion.

359
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,398
Know the Jews said...

360
00:30:56,454 --> 00:31:00,266
mutilated their Women...

361
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,827
and children.

362
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:06,535
They called me
the angel of death.

363
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,834
A butcher.

364
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:14,008
But I'm a doctor,
a person with heart and compassion.

365
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,281
So you mutilated them
out of compassion?

366
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,653
Is a surgeon a butcher
because he uses a knife?

367
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,491
Because he removes
a diseased organ

368
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,690
in order to save the rest?

369
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:32,895
That's not butchery...

370
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,868
that's medicine.

371
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:41,241
I'll tell you everything
so you can finally write your book.

372
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,508
But not here.
Not now.

373
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,947
Enemies are listening.

374
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,180
They're listening, right?

375
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,721
They hear everything we say.

376
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:55,883
Tell you for the last time:

377
00:31:55,947 --> 00:32:01,590
want to speak to my lawyer alone,
as the law dictates.

378
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,633
I'm not your lawyer.

379
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,660
Everyone has the right
to an adequate defense.

380
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,796
Those are your own Words.

381
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:15,243
Understand that monsters
are exceptions to this rule.

382
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,712
But I'm here...

383
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,012
Right in front of you...

384
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,915
and I'm a human.

385
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,821
Flesh, blood, eyes, nose, mouth.

386
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,653
A human.

387
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:33,953
Demand, like the lowliest
of your clients, a lawyer.

388
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,123
Or is this no longer
a constitutional state?

389
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,836
Will you defend him?

390
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:46,908
When was five, played
in the garden with my friend.

391
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,378
We had a tree house.
His father built it for us.

392
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,073
He was a carpenter.

393
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,577
When think of my childhood,

394
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,051
think of the tree house
and the carpentry.

395
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:01,887
One day many police came
and simply took his father away.

396
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,824
He was involved?

397
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:10,354
Years later my mother told me
he was an SS man in Treblinka.

398
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,595
Now you expect answers?
You won't get any.

399
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,434
I've hunted this man
for decades -

400
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,408
from 1975 to 1985
when the bones were found.

401
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,672
Know him as Well as you do.

402
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,840
His answers consist
of lies and deceit.

403
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:29,282
The best we can expect
is a show trial

404
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,321
revealing his lies and self-deceit.

405
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,756
Then lock him away for the
rest of his wretched life.

406
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,292
What if it's not so simple?

407
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,827
It will be simple.

408
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,625
What bothers me about your analysis
isn't your perception of Mengele,

409
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,395
but that you simply assume
we are better human beings.

410
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,460
It's not hard to be
a better human than Mengele.

411
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:53,805
You want to accuse Mengele of his crimes
before a jeering public and lock him up?

412
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,845
That's like Nazi justice.

413
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,743
Know.

414
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,017
I'm merely the public prosecutor.

415
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,347
And who are you?

416
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,046
I'm merely a lawyer.

417
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,723
Together we'd be
a good team, don't you think?

418
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,884
Wouldn't bet on it.

419
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,495
The point isn't that
someone has to do it.

420
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,629
If don't do it,
someone else will.

421
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,036
But he wants me.

422
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,097
Don't know Why shouldn't do it.

423
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,735
He's Josef Mengele!
That's reason enough!

424
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:36,847
This was confiscated from a
demonstrator half an hour ago.

425
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,787
An anti-fascist.

426
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,781
There you go.
Take it and go shoot Mengele.

427
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,488
You'd be a hero
and we'd spare the trial.

428
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,962
Would that be better?

429
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,727
No, not you.
Maybe you or you?

430
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,734
Cut the nonsense!

431
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,736
Nonsense?

432
00:34:54,792 --> 00:35:00,367
But denying Mengele
a defense is OK?

433
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,105
What qualifies you?
Wyatt Earp?

434
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,880
Two reasons.

435
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,681
First:
Everyone has the right to a defense.

436
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,351
Oh, God, son.

437
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,986
Second:
 come from Mengele's hometown

438
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,083
and know his biography
better than anyone else.

439
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,786
What does your Wife think?

440
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,057
Leave my Wife out of this!

441
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,248
Congratulations.
- Why?

442
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,846
It's a sure fire thing.
 checked the car.

443
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,324
Everything's fine.
Only there's still the dent.

444
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,487
Hillman, you can still quit.
You've no obligations.

445
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,588
I'll find someone else.
- No, no Way.

446
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,257
I'm still learning.

447
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,801
My second exam wasn't
so good and this is big.

448
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,427
I'm staying, sure thing.

449
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,903
You know there's only the
basic fee for a public defender.

450
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,340
Not a buck more, from no one.
Understand?

451
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,173
Yes.

452
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,712
See you tomorrow.

453
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,148
Shit.

454
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,735
Get out of the Way!

455
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,969
When does the trial start?

456
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,479
No comment.

457
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,709
Is it true right-wing publisher
Muller patronizes Mengele'?

458
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:48,876
No comment.

459
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,183
Do you have a trial strategy?
- Is there any defense for him?

460
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,223
No comment.

461
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,357
Nazi Pig!

462
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:02,715
Go on home!

463
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,273
Is that What you Wanted?

464
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,611
Where's mother?

465
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,885
She did the right thing.
She Went home.

466
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,358
She said that's his problem.

467
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,123
And? Is it my problem?

468
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,800
You're asking me now?
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

469
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,804
Couldn't get hold of you.

470
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,567
You didn't want to
because you knew my answer.

471
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,540
Know What you want,
but it's not Worth it.

472
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,235
You don't really believe
I'm doing it for career reasons.

473
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:52,042
Saw the press conference.
You get a kick out of it!

474
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,208
That's absolute bull.
 need your help!

475
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,379
Can't help you!
 don't want to be involved.

476
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,117
You're no longer a researcher.
You've no idea What's at stake.

477
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,852
You said you understand me.

478
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,325
Don't understand Why
you're so hard on me.

479
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,057
You want more of this crap?
- The truth!

480
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,892
The truth!

481
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,594
When it's all over,
you'll be a changed person.

482
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,399
Can't help you.
No one can help you then.

483
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,904
So What now?

484
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,271
I'll try to start earlier
at the Tagesspiegel.

485
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,571
So now you want
to Work against me?

486
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,306
We're grownups.
I'll do What think is right.

487
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,745
OK.

488
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,058
Hello.

489
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,497
Felix Hillmann,
my assistant.

490
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,734
Pleased to meet you.

491
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,643
Really?

492
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:02,583
You won't be able to sleep
at night after shaking this hand.

493
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,680
You really want to risk it?

494
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,657
Only talk to you, Mr. Rohm.
Alone.

495
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,888
Said, he's my assistant.

496
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:19,961
Want this envelope
sealed by a notary...today.

497
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,200
To be opened upon my death.

498
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,040
All right.
What's in it?

499
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,204
You'll find out soon enough.

500
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,372
Probably before die.

501
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,477
Fine.

502
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,383
Let's get started on this.

503
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:43,992
Witnesses testify you injected
dye into patients' eyes

504
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:48,554
While they were fully conscious.
Is that true?

505
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,421
Oh' my...

506
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,762
Coincidence rules.

507
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,329
So what?

508
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,503
Are you familiar with the
medical customs of that era?

509
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:04,910
Did you inject numerous conscious
patients in the eye with dye?

510
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:11,579
Can list the medical experiments.

511
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:16,853
But medical history's relevant.

512
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,088
Josef Mengele tacked prisoner's
eyeballs to a board

513
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:24,031
like a butterfly collection.
Did you have that collection?

514
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:30,372
Medical studies require
a collection of specimens.

515
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,600
In the Thirties-

516
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,664
Josef Mengele personally selected

517
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,871
300,000 men, Women
and children for death by gas.

518
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,471
Did you send these people
to the gas chamber?

519
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,551
Thought you
Wanted to understand?

520
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,713
Did you send them
to the gas chambers?

521
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,951
Yes, did.

522
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,995
Did all that.

523
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,628
Admit it.

524
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:03,327
Come, let's Walk a bit.

525
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:11,507
<i>Destroying Unworth y Lives</i>

526
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,916
A doctor must kill
out of compassion.

527
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,145
All of my colleagues
understood this message back then -

528
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,484
scientifically and practically.

529
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,386
That's your defense?

530
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,915
Auschwitz was a popular
medical trend?

531
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,826
If I'm supposed to defend you,
you better come up with better.

532
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,092
You know What a life
in Auschwitz was like?

533
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,768
Hell!

534
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:40,434
Hell Where children, aged
and ill suffered horribly...

535
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,739
Without a chance of survival.

536
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:48,339
Offered the only Way out.

537
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:53,279
Don't be so naive, Peter.

538
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:57,486
Medicine will never
conquer every disease.

539
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:04,090
There will always be
situations Where doctors must kill.

540
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,268
That is my defense...

541
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,776
The Death Angel's defense.

542
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,139
Why now of all times?

543
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,944
Because believe
the time is right...

544
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,078
to understand my motives.

545
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,780
You don't really believe that.

546
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,666
Did a general checkup.

547
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,969
He's in exceptional good health,

548
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:51,502
apart from his arthritic knee
and heart insufficiency.

549
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,105
Can he stand trial?

550
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,844
Absolutely.
Got a lot of fresh air.

551
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,352
Thank you, Dr. Fuglein.

552
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,915
So when's showtime?

553
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,893
We got a letter
from the Federal Chancellor.

554
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,157
They don't want us to lose time.

555
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:11,131
Why are they involved?
- They're nervous.

556
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,067
Is Tuesday in 4 weeks all right?

557
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,762
Tight.
- <i>It'll</i> be OK

558
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,166
Mr. Rohm?
- Yes.

559
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:27,239
I've decided to allow TV
coverage due to public interest,

560
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,581
except for the Witnesses.
 know it's unusual,

561
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,453
but think it's
within my discretion.

562
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,390
It serves the purpose.
So keep this in mind.

563
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:42,261
Mr. Rohm,
you have the hardest job of all.

564
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,698
Understand if you
don't feel comfortable.

565
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,465
But our entire judicial system
is being put to a test.

566
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:55,374
If I catch you not doing your job
I'll pull your license.

567
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,241
Understand?

568
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,611
Yes, understand.

569
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,479
Any more questions?

570
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:12,625
Hello, Rohm.
May I speak to Dr. Karl Gross?

571
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,323
A few questions from 1942--

572
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,127
Mr. Heinrich Knaup?

573
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,895
Yes. It's about the Mengele trial.

574
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,561
Not exactly, we know.

575
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:25,402
But you worked for
Dr. Hans Nachtsheimm in 1943 -

576
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:28,807
for epilepsy experiments.
Remember?

577
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,950
May correctly assume in 1944
you Went with Prof. Strugholt

578
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:41,456
to San Antonio, Texas
as an air force doctor?

579
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:45,619
Are you Willing to tell the
court about your duties in Dachau?

580
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,153
You were at Tubing University
with Dr. Rubenstroth-Bauer.

581
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,462
It would help us if...
But we...

582
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,799
No, fine. Thanks.

583
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,811
Come on, let's go.

584
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:55,158
Don't stand a chance,
no matter how Well defend him.

585
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,927
If do a good job,
I'm a bad person.

586
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,298
If do a bad job, I'm a bad lawyer.

587
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,303
If don't do it,
I'm a coward.

588
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,805
You're not a coward.

589
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:09,004
You can choose between being
a bad person or a good lawyer.

590
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,536
It's the same thing for me.
Otherwise wouldn't be a lawyer.

591
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,514
Did he kick?

592
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,584
Why always he?

593
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,850
What if it's a girl?

594
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,950
Who cares.
As long as it's healthy.

595
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,927
Don't know if can represent
his view in the least.

596
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,429
Must be an asshole.

597
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,473
He's lying!
I'm not his lawyer!

598
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,059
Please rise.

599
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,446
Please be seated.

600
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,074
Hereby open the 27th court.

601
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:22,599
The defendant is Josef Mengele.

602
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,873
This is our last Warning.

603
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:32,284
If you don't obey,
We'll clear the square.

604
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,380
The prosecution's charges
are admitted to the trial.

605
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,085
Will the prosecutor
please read the charges.

606
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,587
<i>Nazis go home!
Nazis go home!</i>

607
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,791
<i>Police line, get out your clubs!
Police line, forward!</i>

608
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,403
Josef Mengele is charged
in numerous cases

609
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:51,701
of murder with bloodthirsty motives.

610
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:57,178
Murder by treacherous,
cruel and dangerous means...

611
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:01,944
of attempting to kill or inciting
others to kill or as an accomplice.

612
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,248
<i>Water cannons, forward!</i>

613
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,884
In detail: Josef Mengele is charged,

614
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,323
in May 1943, Nov. 1944...

00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,762
in Auschwitz of selecting children,
elderly, the sick and handicapped...

616
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,357
Weak and pregnant persons
in 74 cases as unemployable.

617
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:27,240
Thereby sentencing them to a cruel
death by gas in the gas chamber.

618
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:31,172
Josef Mengele is charged with

624

Josef Mengele is charged...

625
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,052
Josef Mengele is charged...

626
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,100
Do you wish to testify?

627
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,360
Yes.

628
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,302
Please answer into the mic.

629
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,338
Yes, of course want to testify.

630
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,915
We will now question you
chronologically about your life,

631
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,179
in order to form a picture.

632
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:48,212
You were born March 16, 1911
in Gunzburg.

633
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,526
Yes, precisely.

634
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:58,089
But we could shorten
the biography.

635
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:03,264
The events after 1930
are relevant for this trial.

636
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:07,832
Let us decide What is relevant
and What is not for your own sake.

637
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:14,406
Don't understand now
my childhood can be relevant.

638
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:17,452
We neither.
But maybe We'll find out.

639
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,589
How long have you
had this problem?

640
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,598
Since this morning.
Yesterday was mad.

641
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,861
Now with them outside
it's simply quiet.

642
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,330
Never imagined
Nazis as bodyquards!

643
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,839
Demand police protection!

644
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,109
Can send a patrol every 2 hrs.
- Shit!

645
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,983
When did you meet your
scientific mentor, Mr. con Verschuer?

646
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:54,921
Oh, much later...

647
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:59,621
In 1937.

648
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:04,757
<i>May point out the book
Destroying Unworth y Lives</i>

649
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,963
by Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche
was published in 1920.

650
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:12,336
It was already a bestseller when
Mengele was in grade school.

651
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:15,103
Even Mr. con Veschuer
didn't come directly from hell.

652
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,202
All these men
were children of the times.

653
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:20,476
Mr. Rohm,
you're confusing cause and effect.

654
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,381
These men
are their nation's children,

655
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,851
influenced by the times.

656
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,912
We're talking about crimes
that never should have happened -

657
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:28,956
at any time.

658
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:34,553
If you're playing with prejudices,
then We're Wasting our time here.

659
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:39,158
Thought we Wanted to find out Why
and under which of society's influences

660
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,668
someone did something
to let justice prevail?

661
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,365
Don't we all want
answers to these questions?

662
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,538
<i>Posh, posh.</i>

663
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,812
Don't Worry.
It's on us.

664
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,984
Your room key.
- Thanks.

665
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:05,849
It's real over-budget,
but the city's booked out.

666
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:10,690
Peter's Waiting downstairs.

667
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,370
Read the daily paper or ask your
lawyer about any side effects.

668
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,812
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

669
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,387
So you're now Claire
from the Brandenburg paper.

670
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,980
You've got your method of
finding the truth and I've got mine.

671
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,686
Main thing is, we don't get
in each other's Way.

672
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,394
Come, let's Walk a bit.

673
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:51,628
Ingenico by Schuco, 1958.
There's only a dozen left.

674
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,807
How much?
- Let's say DM 800.

675
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,038
DM 600!

676
00:53:58,101 --> 00:53:59,944
It's not that late.
You can still quit.

677
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,643
Still haven't got What want.
 want to understand him.

678
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,242
Want to know
What we have in common.

679
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,412
Whoever says nothing,
is making things too easy.

680
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,717
Is it Muller?
- What are you getting at?

681
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,348
800!
- 600!

682
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,619
800!

683
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:14,127
Why don't you go lower?
- won't take less than 800.

684
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,824
Why didn't you start with 1,000?
- Because it costs 800!

685
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,263
Forget it!

686
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,782
Nice day today, Mr. Rohm.

687
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,650
This is the defense strategy:

688
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,990
Our only option is to Weaken
the Witnesses' testimonies.

689
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,930
That will Work
to a certain degree.

690
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:00,238
But there's still one problem:
Why should I do it?

691
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,903
Because you're my lawyer.

692
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:08,609
As your lawyer it's my duty
to tell you this file's full of shit.

693
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:12,518
You haven't changed my
opinion at all in the last 4 weeks

694
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,522
You didn't fulfill your part
of the bargain, Mr. Mengele.

695
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,094
What can say?

696
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,132
Honestly think
you did your best.

697
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,864
Maybe we should part ways now.

698
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:39,246
But first want to tell you
a story about a small girl...

699
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:45,116
A small, pretty, bright girl
who always knew What she Wanted.

700
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:49,885
She Wanted to help, she Wanted
to be a nurse,

701
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:52,722
maybe a doctor.

702
00:55:55,952 --> 00:56:00,799
She became a trainee nurse
here in the psychiatric clinic...

703
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:06,102
the Dr. Wurzbach Clinic,
a psychiatric clinic.

704
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,608
It still is.

705
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:12,374
She worked there for two years,
was very eager,

706
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:16,975
got good grades.

707
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,511
Then suddenly she quit.

708
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:32,222
She Went to Stuttgart
and became a children's nurse.

709
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:37,795
Later a pediatrician.

710
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:42,640
What do you know
about my mother?

711
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:46,647
She worked on her
grandparents' farm.

712
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,616
She did go to Stuttgart
when she was 20.

713
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,278
But she never worked
at Dr. Wurzbach's clinic.

714
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,379
That's the official version.

715
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:58,517
You know so many files
were destroyed in the war.

716
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:07,501
Many people couldn't resist
changing details from their past.

717
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,769
Why should she?

718
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,829
T4.

719
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:16,207
Don't you know What T4 means?

720
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,576
4 Tiergarten Street.

721
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,777
That's a damn lie.

722
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,939
Dr. Wendler?

723
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,572
Don't know who you are,

724
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,135
but this is my first
half hour off since 5:30 am.

725
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,613
I'm Peter Rohm.

726
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,911
It won't take long.
 want to ask a favor.

727
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,883
I've heard of you.
You're famous.

728
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,989
I'm curious What you want.

729
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:10,327
I'd like to look in your
archives from 1937 - 1942.

730
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:13,131
That's not possible.

731
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,032
Or do you have a search Warrant?

732
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,264
Do you have anything to hide?
- Checkmate.

733
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:24,676
Mr. Rohm,
We're a small, renowned institution

734
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,645
with a good reputation.

735
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:29,707
My patients' families-
- It's a private matter.

736
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,663
Hello?

737
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,978
Petzi, my son!
What's Wrong?

738
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,480
Didn't want to wake you up.

739
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,450
Hear everything.
Somethings the matter.

740
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:49,684
No, everything's fine.
Just fine.

741
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:52,283
I'll call you, OK?

742
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,057
Sleep Well.

743
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,742
In June 1941 you were sent
to the front in Hungary

744
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:18,377
with the "Viking" division
of the SS medical corps.

745
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:21,149
Yes, that's correct.

746
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,417
You cared for the injured.

747
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:25,425
According to your own records,

748
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:31,193
you decided Whether the injured
should be treated or left to die.

749
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,961
That's also correct.

750
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,765
Losses were higher
than expected.

751
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:42,902
You let seriously injured
soldiers perish in the mud.

752
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:48,244
Not that I'm comparing
this to Auschwitz...

753
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:51,080
But you had no pangs of guilt?

754
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,781
No, was awarded the Iron Cross.

755
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,516
Quiet, please.

756
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,858
While We're at it, let's not
forget Mengele risked his life

757
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:05,195
to save 2 comrades
under enemy fire

758
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,598
from a burning tank
and treat them.

759
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,534
He was also Wounded in the war.

760
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:13,563
Who decided if you should live
or not when you were Wounded?

761
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:16,235
God decided.

762
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,676
Quiet, please.

763
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,648
You were moved back to Berlin
at the end of 1942 -

764
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,446
to the so-called race
and settlement headquarters.

765
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,884
Correct.

766
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:29,082
Did you know back then about
the mass extermination camps?

767
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:33,616
Knew about
the concentration camps.

768
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,788
Concentration camps.

769
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:43,430
Vast amounts of human material
concentrated in confined quarters.

770
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:49,466
A great chance to conduct
human experiments in a big way?

771
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,940
Yes, of course it was

772
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:00,850
You came to Auschwitz in May, 1943.

773
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,518
How would you describe this camp?

774
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:12,323
It was a mass extermination camp.

775
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:15,460
But you know that.

776
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,171
Continue questioning.
I've no objections.

777
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,232
Could you repeat that?

778
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:27,475
It was a mass
extermination camp...

779
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:33,579
designed to exterminate Jews,
gypsies and political enemies.

780
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:39,355
They were gassed - all of them -
sooner or later.

781
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:45,197
The bodies were burned
in huge crematoriums.

782
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,934
How does one say today?

783
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,136
Disposed of.

784
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:05,544
The chimneys spewed huge clouds
of smoke visible 20, 30 km away.

785
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,447
Traitor.

786
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:12,049
You contributed
to the mass extermination.

787
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:16,153
You're mixing things up.

788
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,893
Never served the Nazis.

789
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,993
Never was a Nazi
in the ideological sense.

790
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:27,167
Simply came to terms with them.
 served under the Nazis,

791
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:31,645
as millions of people did.
- Stop splitting hairs.

792
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,679
Don't care What you
personally thought of Hitler.

793
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:38,480
You practiced race-hygiene for him.
You were a Nazi.

794
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,316
One of the worst.

795
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,991
Everything you did in Auschwitz
was done on your own initiative?

796
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,158
Without an order from above?

797
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,828
Yes. was free to do as chose.

798
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:06,738
Honestly never expected
such frankness.

799
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:11,512
This is a unique opportunity to
bury the Auschwitz lie forever,

800
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,420
with the testimony
by one of the main culprits.

801
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:20,985
Propose a break of 2 days
to re-organize my questions.

802
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,295
Please come to the bench.
Mr. Rohm.

803
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:34,708
Don't think we should
discuss Auschwitz's purpose here.

804
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:38,541
That's already been done.
- By all due respect.

805
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,605
Listen to What is being said.

806
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:45,050
The incorrigible
still find open ears.

807
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,883
Millions of people
are following this trial.

808
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,482
Some expect more lies
from Mengele.

809
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:54,118
Want to give them a chance
to hear the truth from him.

810
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:59,098
Assure you, the defense won't
question the purpose of Auschwitz.

811
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:05,536
In accord with the
prosecutor's proposal,

812
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:09,906
this trial is re-scheduled for
the day after tomorrow, 11 :00 am.

813
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,616
Knew it.

814
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:25,320
There was an autistic Woman
who always sang:

815
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:28,919
<i>What kind of trees are these</i>

816
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,626
<i>where big elephants stroll
without taking their toll.</i> ..

817
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,930
Again and again.

818
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,030
Got used to singing along.

819
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:44,644
Then the singing stopped.

820
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,578
Asked: Where's Greta?

821
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:51,140
They said: Greta died last night.

822
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:56,250
More kept dying.
Always at night.

823
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,220
More kept dying.

824
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,088
But you...

825
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,392
was 17.

826
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:08,902
Was assigned
to the night shift.

827
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:18,441
In Dec. 1940 more than 50 persons
died from cardiac arrest.

828
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,279
Did it.

829
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,247
What?

830
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,818
Twice.

831
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:36,060
Took the needle from the doctor.

832
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:38,564
Didn't know What was in it.

833
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,728
Gave the injection.

834
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:45,432
He said, You do that well

835
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,169
The next morning she was dead.

836
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:54,339
Said, "I can't do that!"

837
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:59,045
He said, "No problem.
You don't have to, Miss Hellweg."

838
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:05,125
My God, do you know
What you did?

839
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:12,266
You knew it the whole time.
- I'm sorry.

840
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:16,227
Never told your father.

841
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,966
Asked myself for years:
What should do?

842
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,974
What was to do?

843
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,801
You lied to me!

844
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,347
By concealing it from me,
you lied to me!

845
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,872
I'm sorry!

846
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,543
What for?
That found out?

847
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:32,847
Does that make you sorry?

848
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,319
You've no idea.

849
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:37,357
What do you know
about living with such guilt?

850
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:42,223
Did have the right
to burden you with it?

851
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,820
Yes, damn it!

852
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,497
Are you sure?
Fuglein?

853
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,872
Thanks.
See you.

854
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,887
<i>Mailbox 0171-8182133.</i>

855
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:10,184
<i>Please leave a message. Bye</i>

856
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:18,231
After a 2 day pause,
Mengele trial recommences tomorrow.

857
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:22,997
After unexpected
confessions from Josef Mengele,

858
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:28,371
radical right-wing
demonstrations abruptly ended

859
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:34,745
However, more violence is expected
from the neo-Nazi scene.

860
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:39,218
New clashes with the police
appear imminent.

861
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:47,959
Those bald monsters
with baseball bats...

862
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,088
are really scary.

863
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,661
Playing like overgrown children.

864
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:03,034
So easy to manipulate,
yet impossible to control.

865
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,638
Heribert Voigt, here.
We must urgently meet.

866
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:11,208
Mengele's confession must mean
trouble for men behind the scene.

867
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:14,152
The entire radical right-wing scene
has disappeared.

868
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,151
You're so quiet today.

869
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:24,159
Know What you're doing
requires considerable concentration.

870
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,533
Mengele is in acute danger.

871
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,230
We replaced the staff
in the high-security ward.

872
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,704
We need to discuss
all else alone in person.

873
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,745
What's that?

874
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,043
A vitamin cocktail.

875
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,545
Peter, Daniel here.

876
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:50,614
Muller has a buddy
in the high-security ward:

877
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:52,818
Dr. Fuglein.

878
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:56,954
You're not the only one
Mengele talks trial strategy to.

879
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:19,013
Once there was a man
who made a deal with another man.

880
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,611
About the truth.

881
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:29,892
One man Wanted to change the truth
and the other man had lied to him.

882
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:37,602
He said, "if you help me tell the
truth, I'll help you change it."

883
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:46,441
A bit like the fable about
the frog and the scorpion.

884
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:50,681
The scorpion asks the frog
to take him across the river.

885
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,810
The frog says:

886
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:56,584
"Why should ?
You'll bite me."

887
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:02,855
don't think the scorpion will.

888
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:07,529
There's a 10-page
sworn affidavit about the men

889
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:13,767
who were kind
enough to enable this trial.

890
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:22,146
Exactly those men
whose ambitions betrayed

891
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,269
Dr. Mengele?

892
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:58,307
That's the young man
 gave the envelope to.

893
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,184
Hope you kept it safe.

894
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,452
Yes, did.

895
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:18,434
How's your mother?

896
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,074
Feel so sorry for her.

897
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:31,079
Now you know.

898
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,121
There's no metamorphosis

899
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:38,818
between the neighbor and monster.

900
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:45,364
It's one and the same person
with the same convictions.

901
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:51,167
The difference lies
in the situation alone.

902
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:00,847
You're critically ill, aren't you?

903
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,313
Yes.

904
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:09,214
It's not rheumatism or arthritis.

905
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,459
It's bone cancer.

906
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:18,088
I've been pumped up
with morphine...

907
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,168
ever since we met.

908
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,942
We made a deal, Mr. Rohm.

909
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:31,477
Don't forget.

910
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:37,516
You want the truth
and want a lawyer.

911
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,149
Coming from your mouth,
truth is a rotten word.

912
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,191
We made a deal, Peter.

913
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,556
Please.

914
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,059
Mengele has cancer.

915
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:55,261
He was on morphine
the whole time.

916
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,104
Who else knows?

917
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:03,209
Dr. Fuglein, probably Muller,
me and now you.

918
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:07,236
Make sure no one finds out.

919
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,007
Muller will keep quiet...

920
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:13,451
if the envelope contains
What Mengele says it does.

921
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,321
He's not fit for trial.
We have to postpone the trial.

922
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:20,622
Are you serious?
The trial's too important.

923
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,491
The World is Watching us.

924
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,691
This is a historic occasion
to settle the account.

925
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,166
You want to miss this chance
because you're a coward?

926
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:32,095
It's my duty to inform my client
that under the circumstances

927
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,537
the trial must be stopped-

928
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:37,441
You know that's not true.
Mengele Wanted the trial from the start.

929
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,501
You did too.

930
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,639
What's Wrong with you?

931
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:50,382
Want to prevent any complaints
if do my job too Well.

932
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:53,422
Stop showing off.

933
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,825
What a pile of shit.

934
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,307
Normally selected healthy ones.

935
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:18,817
Even though you were a doctor?

936
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:22,151
Because was a doctor.

937
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:27,387
You sent the ill to the gas chamber
because you were a doctor?

938
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:29,827
Maybe you should let him finish.

939
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:33,355
Didn't invent Auschwitz.

940
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:38,667
Wanted to help.
Understand?

941
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,404
But the possibilities were limited.

942
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:47,464
There were 140,000 prisoners
crowded into the tightest space.

943
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,390
Couldn't help everyone.

944
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:03,886
Should have let old Women
suffer in a hell-hole of epidemics?

945
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:07,729
Or let small children starve to death?

946
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:15,731
No, was doing them a great
favor, putting an end to it.

947
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:20,339
You personally conducted
the selections.

948
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:23,940
Of course.
 had the authority to.

949
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,952
What was supposed to do?

950
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:30,656
Have you ever seen
a child gassed to death?

951
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,990
They don't die easily.

952
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:40,627
We had to come up
with other alternatives.

953
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,695
Here, help yourself.

954
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,465
Are you afraid?

955
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,014
Dr. Fuglein is identical
with Rudiger Fuglein,

956
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:05,786
who Wrote articles for
the National-Anzeiger regularly.

957
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,250
What about?

958
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,489
Mostly about the study of races.

959
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:14,463
I'm supposed to
say hello from Muller.

960
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,025
Don't Worry.

961
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:19,163
He's not accusing you.
You made the right choice.

962
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,299
He wants you
to fear the right people.

963
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,738
Dr. Fuglein, will you cooperate?

964
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:33,378
How did he become senior doctor
and the court's expert Witness?

965
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:36,389
Muller's got friends in
the Department of Justice.

966
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,584
He's got friends everywhere.

967
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:43,221
We begin tomorrow at 10:00
with Witnesses and experts.

968
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:45,822
No cameras are allowed during
the questioning of Witnesses,

969
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,867
for reasons of objectivity.

970
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:18,528
Important for
Kolbenhjeyer's philosophy...

971
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,693
Parallels between Lorenz
and Kolbenheyer are clear.

972
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:27,764
Lorenz compared modern
civilization to good pets.

973
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:33,112
Mu came with his family.

974
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:36,877
Talks about mescaline.

975
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:43,287
Evening talks with G about
the current political situation.

976
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:50,695
The military, industry and
syndicate is behind the president.

977
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:56,464
Only the international exponents
are yapping:

978
01:19:56,525 --> 01:20:01,531
Freemasons, Jews,
the clergy, Communists.

979
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:06,238
They get away with it
because they dominate the press.

980
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:11,301
The government is attempting
to take control of the media.

981
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,651
That's the key to everything.

982
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:27,390
Let's assume you were his lawyer.

983
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,427
How can anyone defend him?

984
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:41,403
The SS pushed us out
and we had to line up.

985
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:46,475
Dr. Mengele stood there Whistling.

986
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:50,216
Can still hear him...

987
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:53,384
Dvorak.

988
01:20:53,448 --> 01:21:00,559
One hand in his uniform
like Napoleon.

989
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:03,701
He conducted with the other.

990
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:07,106
Most had to go to the left.

991
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:14,543
When he saw Rosa and me,
he stopped Whistling.

992
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,014
We were twins.

993
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:21,180
We know for sure that Mengele
didn't set the death rate.

994
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:27,319
He sent us to his barracks.

995
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:31,762
Our mother and baby sister,
off to the gas chamber.

996
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,231
He decided!

997
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:37,395
You must have had fun.
Whistling, conducting.

998
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,439
Always smiling.

999
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:46,540
Was taught
not to show emotions.

1000
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:51,448
Like the prosecution:
 know you hate my client.

1001
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:54,009
But you seem calm and reasonable.

1002
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:57,488
Your analysis of my state of mind
borders on malicious insinuations.

1003
01:21:57,545 --> 01:22:00,389
Mr. Rohm.
- beg your pardon.

1004
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:11,098
Was a prisoner and doctor.
So had to Work for Mengele.

1005
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,334
What type of work?

1006
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:22,312
Was a pathologist.
 mostly did dissections.

1007
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,683
Mostly on twins.

1008
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,551
What were the results?

1009
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,960
Arm and leg amputations...

1010
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:42,533
removal of organs.

1011
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:51,576
Willful typhus injections.

1012
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,314
Acute anemia
from excessive loss of blood.

1013
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,452
Head wounds.

1014
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,564
We were supposed to study...

1015
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:21,631
if the twins reacted differently.

1016
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:26,972
Did you see Mengele commit
any of this violence to twins?

1017
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:28,912
Or see him kill them?

1018
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:34,950
No, never saw that.

1019
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:40,323
Witnesses have sworn Mengele
personally killed children.

1020
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:43,295
You know that!
- I'm not doubting the Witness.

1021
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:48,130
But Mengele Wasn't the only one
to kill for German science!

1022
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,465
But he killed!

1023
01:23:52,961 --> 01:24:01,540
Mr. Varadi, What results
were pertinent to the accused?

1024
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,522
There were no usable results.

1025
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:14,026
There was no justification
from a scientific viewpoint

1026
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,858
for the children's cruel death?

1027
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:24,199
No. None.

1028
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:28,798
There was a pair of hunchbacks.

1029
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:34,313
The SS came and picked them up.

1030
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:41,719
We thought we'd...
never see them again.

1031
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:46,759
Tell us What happened.

1032
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:53,597
We saw them again.
An SS man brought them back.

1033
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:12,450
They were sewed together...
Back to back!

1034
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:19,087
Their wrists as Well.
Sewn together!

1035
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:30,861
It stank of dying flesh.
The Wounds were dirty.

1036
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:38,970
They didn't scream -
they cried.

1037
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:44,681
They cried all night
until they died.

1038
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:54,252
You mentioned SS men.

1039
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:57,489
Was Mengele one of them?

1040
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,163
Did Mengele personally
sew the children together?

1041
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,794
Think so.

1042
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:07,669
Do you know for sure?
- No.

1043
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:11,575
Could it be another SS man
conducted the operation

1044
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:14,512
and Mengele
had nothing to do with it?

1045
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,139
Don't know.

1046
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:18,275
Please answeer precisely.
The question's simple.

1047
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,319
Is it theoretically possible?

1048
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,324
Maybe.

1049
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:29,960
Thank you.
No further questions.

1050
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:36,799
Except, Mr. Kerbel, you survived.
Did your brother survive?

1051
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,237
Yes. We have a shop in Brooklyn.

1052
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,002
Yes, know.

1053
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:45,101
Excuse the question,
but Why did you survive?

1054
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,544
We were twins.

1055
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:50,173
Mengele picked us.

1056
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,552
Personally?
- Yes.

1057
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:56,248
He needed us for experiments.

1058
01:26:56,311 --> 01:27:03,354
He chiseled
into my brother's right thighbone

1059
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:09,926
and rammed a pipe in...

1060
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:13,602
to get to the bone marrow.

1061
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:16,574
We're cripples.

1062
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:21,172
We were healthy,
now We're cripples.

1063
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:23,977
But you survived.

1064
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:27,611
You survived
because Mengele chose you.

1065
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:29,211
Right?

1066
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:31,154
Yes.
- Thank you.

1067
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:33,283
You goddamn pig!

1068
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,258
You're no lawyer!

1069
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:48,465
You're just as perverted
as that pig there!

1070
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:59,682
I'm supposed to warn you
if notice you're changing.

1071
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:04,312
Asked you to be patient.
- That's asking quite a lot.

1072
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:10,858
If Mengele hadn't killed
the children this way,

1073
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:12,898
would they have been gassed?

1074
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:17,531
He killed them
in order to dissect them.

1075
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:21,096
Please answer my question.

1076
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:24,109
Would they have been gassed?

1077
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,446
Can't say.

1078
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:31,046
May put the question
to the accused?

1079
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:35,343
Yes.

1080
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,717
Mr. Mengele?

1081
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:40,283
This assumption is correct.

1082
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:43,454
All the gypsies were gassed -
Without exception.

1083
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:47,227
Please explain
Why you killed the children.

1084
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:49,268
Simple...

1085
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:52,464
Wanted to spare
them unnecessary suffering.

1086
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:53,938
And succeeded.

1087
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,441
No, Mr. Mengele!

1088
01:28:56,497 --> 01:29:02,072
You killed them to cutout
their eyes, intestines and hearts!

1089
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,913
Already explained.

1090
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:11,980
They were doomed anyway.
 spared them being gassed.

1091
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:15,084
They were of great use
to my scientific research.

1092
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:18,255
Did these children give
you their prior permission?

1093
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,331
Of course not.

1094
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,667
They had no idea of their fate.

1095
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:30,005
If had explained
they wouldn't have understood.

1096
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:32,203
Do you know what?

1097
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:37,045
I'm fed up hearing how
Mengele and his defense

1098
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:42,487
disguise every proven crime
as a humanistic death benefit.

1099
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,682
Can hardly dictate the
defense's presentation of the case.

1100
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:48,888
But humanist ethics
condemns such behavior as

1101
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:51,726
abhorrent, barbaric and inhuman!

1102
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:53,561
Cut the humanist ethics!

1103
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,157
In every history book it says:

1104
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,760
Whatever happened back then
is unfathomable to the human mind.

1105
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:00,601
We're here to try and fathom it.

1106
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:03,574
How can you claim our current
ethics forbid certain behavior

1107
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,703
in the Third Reich when you're
not Willing to try and find out

1108
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:10,875
What the medical ethics
of that era were?

1109
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:46,443
Dr. Fuglein,
may speak to you for a moment?

1110
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:49,585
Could help you.
- Who are you?

1111
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:52,716
I'm the one who ratted on you.
- Leave me alone.

1112
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:56,387
You won't be left alone!
Listen to me!

1113
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,727
You're the lawyer's wife, right?

1114
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:01,494
I'm a journalist.
 need your information.

1115
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:08,366
My paper will pay you DM 100,000
cash and a trip to any destination.

1116
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:12,910
Call me tomorrow...

1117
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:15,675
3 p.m.
At home.

1118
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:17,374
Will.

1119
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:33,928
Quiet, please.

1120
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:39,563
Please concentrate on the trial
or I'll clear the court room.

1121
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:44,906
Mr. Voigt,
What was your last question?

1122
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,809
Please repeat it.

1123
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,378
What did he do to you?

1124
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:54,113
He scraped out
bone marrow Without anesthetic.

1125
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:57,384
But didn't have anesthetic!

1126
01:31:57,445 --> 01:32:04,363
Please listen to me briefly...

1127
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:10,926
A doctor diagnoses gangrene
but has no anesthetic.

1128
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:13,939
What does he do?
He amputates Without it.

1129
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:21,277
Do you call Witnesses who tell
how the surgeon sawed flesh?

1130
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:27,047
Or how the blood spurted?
Or how the patient screamed?

1131
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:32,108
Continue questioning the Witness.

1132
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:48,238
In the early 70s,
you said in a NBC TV show,

1133
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:50,799
you performed for prominent SS.

1134
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:55,211
We had to perform.
We were a circus family.

1135
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:57,749
That was in 1944, you said.

1136
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:58,977
Yes.

1137
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,884
Heinrich Himmler was among them.

1138
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:04,514
Said that,
but it Wasn't Himmler.

1139
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:09,722
Himmler wasn't in Auschwitz in 1944
He was a year earlier.

1140
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:12,094
What's the purpose of these questions?

1141
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:13,723
Want to make
the Witness unsure.

1142
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:15,995
Or make clear to her
that she's not sure herself.

1143
01:33:16,057 --> 01:33:18,503
How dare you!

1144
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:21,296
Interrupt these proceedings
for 15 minutes.

1145
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:23,399
Prosecution and defense -
To my chamber, please.

1146
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:29,004
That's symptomatic of her.
She was mistaken before.

1147
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:31,175
Now she says Mengele
gave her eye drops.

1148
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:34,447
She didn't say that in 1976
at the Shoah Research Center.

1149
01:33:34,508 --> 01:33:36,784
Why's she saying it now?

1150
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,790
She can't keep
repeating every detail.

1151
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:42,157
She has been till now!
In 1965 she said:

1152
01:33:42,216 --> 01:33:45,356
"There's only one reason
Why survived."

1153
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:48,263
"To tell my story over
and over, tell every detail..."

1154
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:50,029
"so nothing will be forgotten."

1155
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:51,035
She said that herself!

1156
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:53,368
She's told her story
over and over again.

1157
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:55,065
She's heard other people's stories.

1158
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,507
She started adding things here
and leaving out others.

1159
01:33:57,565 --> 01:34:01,570
Whatever suited her best.
She's polished her story over the years.

1160
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,246
My job is perfidious enough.

1161
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:08,185
You're making it worse
by not doing your homework.

1162
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:13,720
No memory remains
intact after 50 years.

1163
01:34:14,181 --> 01:34:15,683
What should do?

1164
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,526
Tear me apart, tear Mengeles apart.
But not like that, Mr. Voigt.

1165
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,033
Mrs. Chairman?
- Yes?

1166
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:33,704
The proceedings are interrupted.

1167
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:37,341
A decision to continue will be made
tomorrow morning at the earliest.

1168
01:34:55,656 --> 01:34:58,296
Mrs. Rohm's room?
- Room 1.

1169
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:24,596
The baby's unharmed.

1170
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:47,147
I'm quitting.

1171
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:53,118
It will never be
the way it was.

1172
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:01,164
Hilda told me.

1173
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:05,560
Peter, want to testify.

1174
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:07,870
What?

1175
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:11,171
Want to confront it.

1176
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:17,709
You can't.

1177
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:20,082
You're after the truth.

1178
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:27,016
I'm part of his truth.

1179
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:30,460
He's a part of my truth.

1180
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:32,523
Peter, please.

1181
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:34,725
Let's do it together.

1182
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,801
Let her testify, Peter.

1183
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:52,181
One day my daughter Clara
came out of Mengele's laboratory...

1184
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:55,686
deathly pale.
He'd sterilized her, too.

1185
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:58,349
We said nothing, just hugged.

1186
01:36:58,412 --> 01:37:03,361
Thought, how strong one must be
to endure and survive all this.

1187
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:07,797
She softly said,
"Mom, pray with me."

1188
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:09,960
To God.

1189
01:37:10,024 --> 01:37:13,062
Said, "You know what?"

1190
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:16,506
We always prayed
to the 3 angels at bedtime.

1191
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:19,477
She looked at me
with her big eyes.

1192
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:22,605
Held her tiny hands.
We kissed and hugged.

1193
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:26,914
Then prayed to the 3 angels
that we'll both go to heaven.

1194
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:32,447
When got to the third angel,
 realized the child was dead.

1195
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:53,443
We installed a room there.

1196
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,878
What kind of room?

1197
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:58,473
A small room -
maybe 20 square meters.

1198
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:02,919
Airtight...
Like a big shower.

1199
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:09,861
One pipe system entered the room,
another one led out of it.

1200
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:13,865
You installed the pipe systems?
- Yes.

1201
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:16,765
We built the entire room.
We checked the seals.

1202
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:20,931
That was real important.
No leaks, they always said.

1203
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:22,406
They?
Who are they?

1204
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:23,942
The doctors.

1205
01:38:24,365 --> 01:38:27,471
Do you know What you built?

1206
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:33,712
Of course asked.
But no one gave me a real answer.

1207
01:38:33,774 --> 01:38:38,587
Then someone said
it's for an experiment.

1208
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:42,458
You found out What kind
of experiment it was?

1209
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:44,496
Not the first time...

1210
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:46,792
but the second time
when they called me.

1211
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:49,460
Why were you there again?
Was there a leak?

1212
01:38:49,523 --> 01:38:52,003
No, no.
 did good work.

1213
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:56,974
They called
to have me dismantle it.

1214
01:38:57,031 --> 01:39:00,035
When was that?
- Two months later.

1215
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,376
Amazing.
Only 2 months later,

1216
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:07,818
in August 1942,
you figured out What it was for.

1217
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:12,315
I was only a plumber!
I only did What they told me!

1218
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:16,691
Please tell the court
Where you delivered this chamber.

1219
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,796
Please answer the question.

1220
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:24,725
To the East.

1221
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,865
Auschwitz?
Did you take it to Auschwitz?

1222
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:30,934
Yes.

1223
01:39:32,733 --> 01:39:36,044
Euthanasia is forbidden without
exception in our system of laws.

1224
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:38,549
Yet you're familiar with the topic.

1225
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:41,984
Euthanasia is practiced
daily in Germany.

1226
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:45,717
A vast legal gray area.

1227
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:48,684
Please be more precise.
Where?

1228
01:39:48,749 --> 01:39:50,558
In hospitals.

1229
01:39:50,617 --> 01:39:53,257
Doctors are confronted
with the decision daily...

1230
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,631
Whether to disregard
the principle of life-support

1231
01:39:56,690 --> 01:40:03,574
in order to free
hopeless cases from great pain.

1232
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:06,270
One lets them die?
- Yes.

1233
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:11,248
Does euthanasia occur Without the
consent of the patient or his relatives?

1234
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:15,048
They've loosened up
over the years in tiny steps.

1235
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:20,525
For moral reasons,
but the real reason is economical.

1236
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:26,532
Statistically seen a dying patient's
last 30 days are the most expensive.

1237
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:31,229
Money spent
when it is needed elsewhere.

1238
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:34,431
Other countries
discuss this much more openly.

1239
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:41,413
Figure in the next 10-20 years,
euthanasia will be legalized.

1240
01:40:41,468 --> 01:40:43,812
But no one would go so far as

1241
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:50,186
to condone testing
new drugs on dying patients.

1242
01:40:50,244 --> 01:40:53,851
That's a leading question
of the first degree.

1243
01:40:53,914 --> 01:40:56,622
Knew I'd be
asked such a question.

1244
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:58,526
It happens.

1245
01:40:58,585 --> 01:41:03,398
Several cases are on record
Where patients were misused.

1246
01:41:03,457 --> 01:41:06,995
Misused meaning,
they didn't give their consent.

1247
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:09,769
Why not?

1248
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:16,679
One doctor justified himself,
"They'll die anyway."

1249
01:41:17,838 --> 01:41:20,216
That's a quote.

1250
01:41:20,274 --> 01:41:24,518
That was Dr. Lutzmann
on trial in 1986 in Kassel.

1251
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:28,424
Where did Dr. Lutzmann work?

1252
01:41:28,482 --> 01:41:31,463
At a home for the mentally
and physically handicapped.

1253
01:41:32,986 --> 01:41:37,958
His guinea pigs weren't dying,
they were handicapped.

1254
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:43,540
Most of them were healthy.

1255
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:47,443
He tested a new
tranquilizer on them.

1256
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:49,777
One of them died,

1257
01:41:49,837 --> 01:41:52,374
it was proven, from an overdose.

1258
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:57,752
Dr. Luzmann was fined DM 4,000
and allowed to practice further.

1259
01:42:28,108 --> 01:42:30,213
When did you Work
in the Wurzbach Clinic?

1260
01:42:30,277 --> 01:42:32,154
Please follow protocol.

1261
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:35,785
The defense should use the polite
form when addressing the Witness.

1262
01:42:35,849 --> 01:42:38,329
She's my mother.
 don't know What's the point.

1263
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:40,023
Continue.

1264
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:43,296
When did you Work there?

1265
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:49,603
From 1940 to 1942.
 was a nurse trainee.

1266
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,404
What was your job?

1267
01:42:51,465 --> 01:42:56,312
Tended the handicapped,
adults and children...

1268
01:42:56,370 --> 01:43:00,250
The usual care.

1269
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:05,757
We learned how to use syringes.

1270
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:11,421
The drugs came from
the doctor on duty, of course.

1271
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:14,728
But gave the injections.

1272
01:43:19,793 --> 01:43:26,267
In at least 2 cases gave
patients a deadly overdose of Evipan.

1273
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:33,251
Did you do so voluntarily?

1274
01:43:33,307 --> 01:43:39,986
Didn't know What had done.
 just gave them an injection.

1275
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:43,358
They were dead the next morning.

1276
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:51,333
Told Dr. Beckmann...

1277
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:54,270
"I don't want to do it.

1278
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:56,035
Refuse."

1279
01:43:56,096 --> 01:43:59,441
never again had to.

1280
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:04,081
Thought for weeks about it,
for months.

1281
01:44:04,137 --> 01:44:08,142
More patients kept dying -

1282
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:12,213
simply dead the next morning.

1283
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:18,992
There was a new chamber
installed in Hall 3.

1284
01:44:20,487 --> 01:44:25,129
The whole building
stank faintly of fumes.

1285
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:29,366
That went on for 2 weeks

1286
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:32,137
Two weeks.
Then what'?

1287
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:35,009
Then it suddenly stopped.

1288
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:38,606
Why did these killings stop?

1289
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:42,586
They didn't want to any more.

1290
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:44,247
Who?
Who didn't want to?

1291
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:47,258
Everyone.
The people.

1292
01:44:47,314 --> 01:44:50,591
They knew What was going on.

1293
01:44:50,651 --> 01:44:55,623
Knew...
It Wasn't normal.

1294
01:44:57,591 --> 01:45:02,597
It was horrible and was in
the midst and didn't understand.

1295
01:45:03,563 --> 01:45:05,133
Then you quit?

1296
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:07,041
Yes.

1297
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:11,378
After the war lied.

1298
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:15,409
Erased those 2 years.

1299
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:18,752
Didn't want to remember.

1300
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:27,521
Because the chamber was used
for such a brief period...

1301
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:33,833
the Wurzbach Clinic was never officially
declared an euthanasia institution.

1302
01:45:35,128 --> 01:45:37,108
Thank you, mother.

1303
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:43,279
Mrs. Rohm?
Do you feel guilty?

1304
01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:46,684
Yes.

1305
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:53,083
High Court,
Ladies and Gentlemen:

1306
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:58,749
German law is based on a great
achievement of civilization:

1307
01:46:58,812 --> 01:47:01,554
Maximization of context.

1308
01:47:01,615 --> 01:47:03,788
We have done our duty.

1309
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:11,564
In this trial we've examined each
charge from every possible viewpoint.

1310
01:47:11,625 --> 01:47:13,332
What was the point?

1311
01:47:13,393 --> 01:47:17,466
The worst criminal
of all times sits over there.

1312
01:47:17,531 --> 01:47:20,910
What really happened here...

1313
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:25,507
was a gradual minimization
of the context,

1314
01:47:25,572 --> 01:47:29,076
turning the unfathomable
crimes committed my Mengele

1315
01:47:29,142 --> 01:47:31,986
into a topic of euthanasia.

1316
01:47:32,045 --> 01:47:38,189
This is a great achievement
by the defense, Peter Rohm.

1317
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:40,561
But do not reproach him.

1318
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:44,124
He defended his client well.

1319
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:49,903
He pointed out the difference
between Mengele and many others,

1320
01:47:49,963 --> 01:47:52,239
with his mother's testimony.

1321
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:58,306
She feels guilt
because she didn't know better.

1322
01:47:58,371 --> 01:48:01,875
She had to live with this guilt.

1323
01:48:01,942 --> 01:48:04,183
But Mengele feels no guilt.

1324
01:48:04,244 --> 01:48:08,351
Only bitterness towards
the accusations against him.

1325
01:48:08,415 --> 01:48:11,988
He is Well aware of his crimes.

1326
01:48:12,052 --> 01:48:14,726
How can he not feel guilt?

1327
01:48:14,788 --> 01:48:18,167
No regret?
No compassion?

1328
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:21,138
Why doesn't it tear him apart?

1329
01:48:21,194 --> 01:48:24,175
Why doesn't he scream
in pain for his deeds?

1330
01:48:25,932 --> 01:48:28,742
It doesn't play a role
if he was a Nazi or not.

1331
01:48:28,802 --> 01:48:31,612
He Wasn't a politically
motivated person.

1332
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:35,847
His personal motives were
primitive and egotistical.

1333
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:40,016
He was a lousy doctor,
an arrogant, incompetent scientist

1334
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,152
who used the system for his career.

1335
01:48:43,216 --> 01:48:47,824
Throughout the trial
he never let us doubt...

1336
01:48:47,888 --> 01:48:53,998
he was pleased with What
he did until February, 1945.

1337
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,939
This allows only 1 conclusion:

1338
01:48:56,997 --> 01:49:00,035
Josef Mengele
is one of the most cruel,

1339
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:03,877
power-hungry psychopaths
this country has ever faced.

1340
01:49:03,937 --> 01:49:10,650
He is intelligent and cunning
enough to hide his true, sick self

1341
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:16,888
behind pseudo-scientific
and pseudo-humanistic motives.

1342
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:23,333
He is well aware of his guilt,
but it leaves him cold.

1343
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:30,672
He enjoyed humiliating people,
torturing, killing...

1344
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:35,543
gloating over the suffering
and deaths of his victims.

1345
01:49:35,602 --> 01:49:38,708
That was back then.

1346
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:44,688
Now an old man sits here,
satisfied how he's become a myth.

1347
01:49:44,744 --> 01:49:50,319
His name a symbol of horror burned
in our collective consciousness:

1348
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:54,388
The Death Angel of Auschwitz!
What triumph!

1349
01:49:54,454 --> 01:49:57,094
But Mr. Mengele is bitter.

1350
01:49:57,157 --> 01:50:02,300
He spent half a century
in poverty, lonely, deserted -

1351
01:50:02,362 --> 01:50:05,536
unable to enjoy his fame.

1352
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,773
Kept Wondering Why
he turned himself in.

1353
01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:10,712
Now know:

1354
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:13,046
He could only win.
He had already won.

1355
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:17,714
During the trial he reaped
What he had sowh in Auschwitz.

1356
01:50:17,777 --> 01:50:24,490
His own legend
became human flesh and blood.

1357
01:50:24,551 --> 01:50:26,531
Congratulations, Mr. Mengele.

1358
01:50:28,655 --> 01:50:31,864
Call for the maximum sentence.

1359
01:50:31,925 --> 01:50:38,206
Know he'll spend the rest
of his life content in prison.

1360
01:50:38,264 --> 01:50:43,441
Three daily meals and with
comforts he never had in Argentina.

1361
01:50:43,503 --> 01:50:49,647
Even if he is so sentenced...

1362
01:50:49,709 --> 01:50:54,249
this man has already
conquered us.

1363
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:05,802
Defense Counsel?
Your summation.

1364
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:12,770
High Court,
Ladies and Gentlemen:

1365
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:18,077
This was a standard book
in the Third Reich and earlier.

1366
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:20,641
Every German doctor had a copy.

1367
01:51:20,707 --> 01:51:24,348
<i>For the Destruction of Unworth y Life.</i>

1368
01:51:24,411 --> 01:51:28,223
The authors maintained:
not all life is Worth living.

1369
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:32,821
Doctors must take not save
lives under certain circumstances.

1370
01:51:32,886 --> 01:51:34,991
Let me briefly explain.

1371
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:39,731
Imagine you're a doctor
and you have an 85-year-old patient.

1372
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:44,833
She will die within 1 week
from bone cancer.

1373
01:51:44,898 --> 01:51:47,902
Bone cancer is extremely painful.

1374
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:51,244
You give the patient morphine
again and again.

1375
01:51:51,304 --> 01:51:56,185
You know it's not enough.
She suffers incredible pain.

1376
01:51:56,242 --> 01:51:58,381
You can't increase the dosage -
it would kill her.

1377
01:51:58,445 --> 01:52:04,691
You explain this to her
and she begs you for more.

1378
01:52:04,751 --> 01:52:08,426
A small step
from healer to killer.

1379
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:11,332
This book advises doctors
to take this step.

1380
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:14,702
In the course of this trial
we learned

1381
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:17,742
this happens daily
here and now.

1382
01:52:17,797 --> 01:52:21,973
What if the patient
was 75 years old instead of 85?

1383
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:23,514
Or 55?

1384
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:25,846
She too suffers unbearably.

1385
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:27,851
She too asks for more.

1386
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:29,784
Could you refuse?

1387
01:52:29,843 --> 01:52:32,323
A further small step.

1388
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:39,091
Your patient is 30 or 15.
Or only 5 years old.

1389
01:52:39,152 --> 01:52:40,654
Then we have a problem:

1390
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:43,496
A child doesn't
realize the consequences.

1391
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:45,433
But its parents ask you:

1392
01:52:45,492 --> 01:52:48,598
Please, doctor. Give her more!

1393
01:52:48,661 --> 01:52:51,301
Could you refuse?

1394
01:52:51,364 --> 01:52:53,970
One further small step.

1395
01:52:54,033 --> 01:52:59,244
But We're not talking about a hospital
and a dying patient in this trial.

1396
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:02,411
We're talking about Auschwitz
and What happened there.

1397
01:53:02,475 --> 01:53:05,786
Let's think one small step further.

1398
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:10,419
Euthanasia as an act of grace
in a concentration camp.

1399
01:53:10,483 --> 01:53:12,622
You're a doctor there.

1400
01:53:12,685 --> 01:53:16,599
Many people,
including children, suffer incredibly.

1401
01:53:16,656 --> 01:53:19,830
They're not hospital patients.

1402
01:53:19,893 --> 01:53:25,343
No. They were carted there like
livestock for days in railway cars.

1403
01:53:25,398 --> 01:53:31,940
Suddenly they're in these
infested, inhumane barracks.

1404
01:53:32,005 --> 01:53:36,283
You're a doctor.
It's not your fault.

1405
01:53:36,342 --> 01:53:39,186
Now what?
You're a doctor.

1406
01:53:39,245 --> 01:53:43,421
How can you deny these people
What you already gave others?

1407
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:46,362
After taking all those steps?

1408
01:53:46,419 --> 01:53:49,059
Why am telling you all this?

1409
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:54,138
So that you see...

1410
01:53:54,194 --> 01:54:01,737
Mengele was
a victim of circumstance...

1411
01:54:01,801 --> 01:54:07,046
created by the era he lived in.

1412
01:54:23,623 --> 01:54:25,603
Mr. Rohm?

1413
01:54:28,027 --> 01:54:30,530
What do you call for?

1414
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:34,102
How do you plea?

1415
01:54:37,303 --> 01:54:41,718
Defended Mengele for 2 reasons:

1416
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:45,221
First, Wanted to know the truth.

1417
01:54:45,278 --> 01:54:50,023
Second, Wanted to be
a good lawyer defending justice.

1418
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:56,295
Tried to understand
Mengele's deeds...

1419
01:54:56,356 --> 01:55:00,099
in their context in time.

1420
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:04,630
Instead had to hear...

1421
01:55:04,697 --> 01:55:11,342
Mengele doesn't comprehend
that What he did back then

1422
01:55:11,404 --> 01:55:16,786
in Auschwitz belongs to the worst
crimes anyone can imagine.

1423
01:55:22,081 --> 01:55:24,857
We had to endure his excuse...

1424
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:31,893
that these crimes were
committed out of compassion.

1425
01:55:34,727 --> 01:55:40,507
Mengele hasn't shown the
slightest signs of remorse until now.

1426
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:45,776
A greater contempt
for mankind is inconceivable.

1427
01:55:47,674 --> 01:55:53,056
No one else has murdered
so perversely and cold-bloodedly.

1428
01:55:59,919 --> 01:56:03,366
This trial...

1429
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:07,565
has shown us
how susceptible we all are.

1430
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:14,306
It's also shown us how small
the step to loss of human values is.

1431
01:56:18,805 --> 01:56:21,479
Josef Mengele is guilty.

1432
01:56:23,876 --> 01:56:27,688
Call for a lifetime sentence.

1433
01:57:02,315 --> 01:57:07,822
If there is a God,
then he knows the truth.

1434
01:57:09,722 --> 01:57:12,168
Am innocent.

1435
01:57:13,259 --> 01:57:19,369
The truth always
hides behind the facts.

1436
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:23,813
Killed...
Of course killed.

1437
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:27,750
For the benefit of mankind,
because was a good doctor.

1438
01:57:27,807 --> 01:57:30,811
A good scientist.

1439
01:57:30,877 --> 01:57:34,848
A scientist can't afford
to make mistakes.

1440
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:47,327
The best doctors must kill daily.

1441
01:57:54,333 --> 01:58:01,342
Today they have rats
and mice, apes...

1442
01:58:02,942 --> 01:58:05,889
and waste precious time.

1443
01:58:06,512 --> 01:58:09,425
We didn't waste time back then.

1444
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:16,262
One more year and we'd
have revolutionized medicine.

1445
01:58:19,859 --> 01:58:22,897
It's all been delayed.

1446
01:58:24,197 --> 01:58:31,547
We laid the foundation
for What medicine achieves today.

1447
01:58:35,141 --> 01:58:38,679
Truth tolerates no mistakes.

1448
01:58:38,744 --> 01:58:43,744
We repeated our experiments
again and again and again...

1449
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:53,096
to assure absolute certainty.

1450
01:58:53,526 --> 01:58:56,439
Almost became a professor -

1451
01:58:56,496 --> 01:59:03,414
like my teacher and mentor,
con Verschuer.

1452
01:59:14,914 --> 01:59:19,920
We'd have a better position
in a medical court.

1453
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:29,373
These ignorant bureaucrats
haven't a clue What medicine can do.

1454
01:59:29,428 --> 01:59:32,739
The future is decisive.

1455
01:59:32,798 --> 01:59:35,574
We will see.

1456
01:59:37,503 --> 01:59:39,676
I'm optimistic.

1457
01:59:42,074 --> 01:59:45,146
What do you see?

1458
01:59:46,045 --> 01:59:51,358
Do you at least see
a bit of yourself in me?

1459
01:59:56,088 --> 01:59:59,831
Josef Mengele never had
to appear in a German court.

1460
01:59:59,892 --> 02:00:04,534
He died on February 7, 1979,
in Brazil.

1461
02:00:05,598 --> 02:00:07,839
Dear Goetz, dear Kai:

1462
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:10,540
Many thanks
for your exceptional involvement.

1463
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:13,848
This film wouldn't have been
possible Without the hard Work

1464
02:00:13,906 --> 02:00:15,078
and material sacrifices
of all the contributors

1465
02:00:15,141 --> 02:00:17,781
before and behind the camera.
My heartfelt thanks go to all of you.
