00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,333
It's just 8 months, then
We're never apart again.

I knoW.
I knoW.

Nothing, nothing

00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:34,875
Trust me.

7
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,417
I do.
It's just...

8
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,708
We're still
gonna get married.

9
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,333
We're still gonna
build a life together.

10
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:41,917
Just keep reminding yourself

This is aWesome.

Ben, I still feel like you're
gonna change out there.

17
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,958
What if this changes?

18
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,125
I Won't let it.

19
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,750
But What about our plans
for our ministry?

20
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,750
You're such a good preacher.
You can still do seminary.

21
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,250
We've been
through this before.

22
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:38,292
It's not something I Want to do,
but We can still do

23
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,750
the ministry We discussed.

24
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,875
We can still help people
even more noW that I've been

25
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,333
on the ground floor of a company
Where I can build a good career.

26
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:50,708
I have to do it in the City,
and you knoW that.

27
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,167
That career stuff
just doesn't...

28
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,042
I just Want
to be With you.

29
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:05,875

Ben, this doesn't

What if this is one
of those moments,

38
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,417
a moment We're gonna
regret later?

39
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,875
It isn't,

Don't Want to make Jim

You never

52
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,000
It's not your birthday.

53
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,417
I bet you don't
even knoW my birthday.

54
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,375
It's on a day in one

Got about three calls

Don't you think they've
Waited long enough?

61
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,375
Almost.

62
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,667
You're terrible.

63
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,917

Can you believe they charge
$4.50 for a cup of coffee?

67
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,750
I think We're in
the Wrong business.

68
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:17,958
And you are?

69
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:21,292
<i>I'm a fortune teller.
I can see the future.</i>

70
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,708
Somebody'd pay
a lot for that.

71
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,833
They already do.

72
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,833

Didn't he say he Was gonna
say something about the future?

78
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,875

105
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,875
WoW, I drove a long Way.

106
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,417
Look, I'm not going back
to Clearville.

107
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,292
You see, I spent my Whole life
trying to escape from there.

108
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,917
Well, that's Where
your car is headed.

109
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,042
I guess it's your call.

110
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,208
But...

111
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,042
Whatever happened to you?

00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,875
<i>You had such potential.</i>

113
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,875
Hey pal, did you happen
to notice that the car

114
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:55,708
on the hook back there
is a $250,000 Mercedes?

115
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,083
That's just What
I'm talking about,

116
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:01,208
fast cars, faster Women,

117
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,750

<i>I told you, I was
sent here to help you.</i>

119
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:06,875
I don't need your help.

120

you Were gonna say that.

122

But once he makes up his mind,
Well, you knoW hoW he is.

Who are We talking about,
Mr. Big of the toWing industry?

124
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,792
Have you ever taken a moment
and stopped to think

125
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,833
that you've lived your life
up until noW

126
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:24,250
and completely
missed the point?

127
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,833
Life is life.

128
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,042
You live, you die, that's it.
There is no point.

129
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,083
That's the dumbest thing
you've said so far.

130
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,875
I don't understand
Why he chose you.

131
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay, you knoW What?

132
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,292

All right, look.

<i>Now that we're here,

<i>have changed just a little bit.</i>

00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,750
Well, things have
changed a lot.

138
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,083
The most important thing
to remember noW...

139
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,250
Why Won't this open?

140
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,917

For right noW it's reality.
It's your reality.

144
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,042
You're just going
to have to accept it.

145
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,167
Don't do anything stupid like
jumping out in front of a car

146
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,833
or sticking your finger
in some light socket to see

147
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,875
if it's real, okay,
because it is.

148

Okay, but can you just

<i>Oh, she'll freak out

153
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,750
Uh, no.

154
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:30,875
Trust me, it Will be a lot
better if you close your eyes

155
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,125
<i>and count backwards.</i>

156
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,708
Yeah, trust you?
I don't even knoW you.

157
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,208

00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,417
Really?
Thanks, dad.

174
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,667
Dad, dad, no.
I'm not your dad.

175
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,708
I'm not anybody's dad.

176
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,875
<i>I knew I was adopted!</i>

177
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:45,042
Honey, you are not adopted,
and you are going to church.

178
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,417
<i>Daddy said
I didn't have to.</i>

179
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,875
<i>Ben Walker, are you trying
to drive me crazy this morning?</i>

180
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,250
<i>Or does it just come naturally?</i>

181
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,292
<i>Either way, you're gonna have
to explain to your daughter</i>

182
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,375
<i>why it's so important that
she goes to church.</i>

183
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,875
Oh.

184
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:05,792
<i>Um, well, see there are certain
things in life that are,</i>

185
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,417
<i>you know, very important.</i>

186
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,708
<i>You know, like,
like uh, like um,</i>

187
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:17,417
a healthy nutritious breakfast,
you knoW, and hard Work

188
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:22,708
and certain amount
of exercise is good.

189
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,042
And?

190
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,333
Oh, and going to church.

191
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm not going.

192
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,875
<i>Well, let me make
this easy for you.</i>

193
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:36,042
First, you're gonna go
because I said so.

194
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,917
And second, if you can't start
thanking Jesus for everything

195
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,250
<i>he's given you, then maybe you
should start giving</i>

196
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,792
<i>some things back, like
starting with your cell phone.</i>

197
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,208
- Ben.
- Huh?

198
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,292
Go.

199
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,875
Go Where?

200
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,708
<i>You know, they say only one
in a hundred people dreams</i>

201
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:08,125
in color, and apparently
I'm the one,

202
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,042
though I never kneW it before.

203
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,667
Wonder if I'll remember
When I Wake up.

204
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,250
Here's your tie.

205
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,375
You're kidding me.
I Wouldn't buy this.

206
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,417
I knoW.

207
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,375
It Was a father's day gift
from Megan, remember?

208
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:28,083
Oh.
Okay.

209
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,708
Since When do you knoW
hoW to do that on your oWn?

210
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,833
I'm okay as long as
I don't think about it?

211
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:46,042
Hmm.

212
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,667
WoW.

213
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,833
Um.

214
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:07,375
Wendy, there's something I feel
I should tell you,

215
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:10,708
Which is really strange given
that this is only a dream

216
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:11,833
and you're never
gonna believe me,

217
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:14,958
but you have to
because it's important.

218
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,792
It's important
for you to knoW.

219
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,833
Mm-hmm.

220
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:19,958
I'm not your Ben.

221
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:22,292
I mean I am,
but I'm not.

222
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,125
I knoW.

223
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,167
You do?

224
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,292
You think I don't knoW
When my husband isn't himself?

225
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,875
It's not easy to come here
and save the day.

226
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:42,042
It's a lot of pressure, but
I knoW you're gonna do great.

227
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:46,708
You alWays do.
I have no doubt.

228
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,792
NoW put on your coat.
We're gonna be late.

229
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:08,042
Okay, just go With it
until We can find Mike

230
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,833
and get out of this.

231
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,667
Yeah.

232
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,083
Wait, Megan, one second.

233
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,958
Uh, aren't you
forgetting something?

234
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:41,958
What?

235
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,208
Oh.

236
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,667
Okay, let's hurry.

237
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,833
<i>Okay.</i>

238
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,708
We're gonna be late.
Okay, let's go.

239
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:01,333
Ha!
L... I drive a minivan.

240
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,042
Yeah.

241
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,292
Let's go.
Let's go.

242
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,292
Hmm, convenient.

243
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:36,250
That saved a Wretch like me.

244
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,417
I once Was lost.

245
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,208
It's a little far forWard,
don't you think?

246
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,125
Cut it out, Ben.

247
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,083
I haven't seen
this place in years.

248
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,125
Sure could use an upgrade.

249
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,833
It's probably got the same
gum underneath the seats.

250
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:52,708
Reverend, it's already time.

251
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,167
They're ready for you noW.

252
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,292
Reverend?
Reverend?

253
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:05,917
This is a very exciting day
for the little, White church,

254
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,417
so please join me in
giving a Warm Welcome

255
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:15,417
to our neW pastor,
Reverend Dr. Benjamin Walker.

256
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,250
Okay.

257
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:49,750
Uh, hi, it's a... it's good
to see you all here.

258
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:52,833
Some of you are
With your families.

259
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:56,042
I'm With my family as Well.

260
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,917
<i>Wendy there with Megan
and my other daughter</i>

261
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,417
Whose name escapes me
at the moment.

262
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,333
Oh, you knoW I
got my Bible here.

263
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:16,167
Yup, it's... you're probably
expecting me to read from

264
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,208
the Bible, right, 'cause that's
What a lot of preachers do.

265
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,000
You knoW,
I'm a little different.

266
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:30,875
<i>You know, I... I...</i>

267
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,417
The Bible's old.
It's really old.

268
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:41,167
<i>So I think it'd be good to talk
about some modern things.</i>

269
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,292
You knoW, 'cause things,
things are important,

270
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,000
and We all need certain things.

271
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:53,708
And God, he Wants us to have
What We need, right?

272
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,292
Noah, look, there's Noah.
He had an ark.

273
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,792
Noah had an ark.

274
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,417
And Well, he couldn't have
afforded to build

275
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,833
the ark Without money.

276
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:12,958
<i>You know, so God obviously
wants us to have money.</i>

277
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:18,375
<i>And God wants us to be happy.</i>

278
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,375
So, so...

279
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:30,208
...try to make more money,
so you can buy things,

280
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:34,042
<i>and then you'll be happy.</i>

281
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,417
God bless you.

282
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,875
Oh, um...

283
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:07,167
Uh, that Was our
message for today.

284
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,750
<i>Make more money?</i>

285
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,042
Are you out of your mind?

286
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,167
I Was, you knoW,
completely unprepared.

287
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,875
But you had 3 Weeks
to learn that sermon,

288
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:30,708
Which I might add, only lasted
less than a minute.

289
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:35,042
The collection Was doWn
about 70% from last Week

290
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:38,083
When We had a prayer service
Without a minister.

291
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:42,417
Oh, that not using the Bible
thing, that Was different.

292
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,417
Well, you knoW,
it's important to keep it fresh.

293
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:47,375
Yup.
Uh-oh.

294
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,292
<i>You should be
ashamed of yourself.</i>

295
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:55,042
If Pastor McKennett
Wasn't already gone,

296
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,750
that sermon Would
have killed him.

297
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,167
Personally, I thought
it Was great.

298
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,875
No Wasted time.
Right to the point.

299
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,667
Things are good,
make more money.

300
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,875
It Works for me.

301
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,417
See you next Week, Reverend.

302
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,042
Don't count on it.

303
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:17,750
Hey, you knoW, I'd really
prefer to get to knoW

304
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,750
<i>his parents a little bit more
before they get too close.</i>

305
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,750
I'll take care of this.
I got it.

306
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,042
I didn't knoW you
Went to this church.

307
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:27,000
I didn't knoW
the neW pastor Was your dad.

308
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,250
His sermon Was...

309
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,875
Oh, I knoW
he can be such...

310
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,917
Can you give us a moment?

311
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,125
What do you care?

312
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,375
After all, I'm just the daughter
Whose name escapes you

313
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:36,833
<i>at the moment, right?</i>

314
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,708
We like to have fun,
don't We?

315
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,042
<i>But seriously, though, I need
to have a few words</i>

316
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,333
With this young man.

317
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,292
Look, kid, I'm neW
to this father thing,

318
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,042
but I knoW a deal closer
When I see one.

319
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,375
You're neW to
the father thing?

320
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,875
Yeah, so here,
I'll give you 80 bucks

321
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,042
to stay aWay
from my daughter.

322
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:03,208
Apparently, it's all I've got.

323
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,750
Are you serious?

324
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:06,042
Oh, yeah.

325
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,833
But no phone calls,
no stopping by to chat,

326
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,708
no Working on homeWork together.

327
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:12,417
As of this moment,
she doesn't exist, you got it?

328
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:13,750
Uh-huh.

329
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay, you can leave noW.

330
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,875
Bye-bye, thanks.

331
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,958
Okay.

332
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:34,083
Wait!
Hey!

333
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:38,708
What is Wrong With him?

334
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:41,417
L... I don't knoW.

335
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,167
Come on!

336
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:00,708
Mike!
Come on, I'm right here.

337
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,750
Why didn't you stop?

338
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,750
Does this look
like a taxi to you?

339
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:29,333
<i>So have you
figured it out yet?</i>

340
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:33,292
It's a dream, right?

341
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:38,750
A long, involved, incredibly
complex and convoluted dream.

342
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,292
You feel pain
in a dream?

343
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,833
No, Why?

344
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:44,917
Ah!

345
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,292
What'd you do that for?

346
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,417
Well, noW We can
rule out a dream.

347
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,667
But delusions, Well,
that's a lot trickier.

348
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,917
You see, they come With taste
and smell, and the Whole deal.

349
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,375
Well, hoW can you tell
the difference?

350
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,042
<i>Well, it usually takes
another person,</i>

351
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,875
<i>a disinterested third party
to confirm or deny</i>

352
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,958
that What you perceive is real.

353
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:04,667
And that Would be you?

354
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,417
Oh yeah, sure.
I could do that for ya.

355
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,333
Just... just so I'm clear,
you honestly expect me

356
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:15,375
to believe that
you're an angel?

357
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,833
I don't expect
anything from you.

358
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:20,167
<i>I am what I am.</i>

359
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,833
Well, then prove it.
Do something angelic.

360
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm not alloWed to use my
poWer While in earthly form.

361
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,708
You have an ansWer
for everything.

362
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,250
Not everything.

363
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:33,125
I don't knoW What's
Wrong With your car.

364
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:34,875
Okay, you knoW,
accepting for the moment

365
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:38,000
the ridiculous notion that you
are an angel, What is this?

366
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,208
What's Wendy doing here?

367
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,167
Why does everyone act
like they knoW me?

368
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,042
Oh, that's simple.

369
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:47,375
It's called the great What if.

370
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,375
What if?

371
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,125
Yeah, see,
every noW and then

372
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:53,750
he chooses someone
to re-examine their life.

373
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:57,042
What if you had said yes
instead of no?

374
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,833
What if you had made
different decisions?

375
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:03,167
<i>What if the Lord was calling
and you answered the call?</i>

376
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,125
And What if, Well, you folloWed
God's plan for your life

377
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,417
instead of your oWn?

378
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:11,083
Well, apparently, I Would
be a second-rate preacher

379
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:13,042
at a third-rate church
in Clearville.

380
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:16,417
<i>Well, you knew
what you had.</i>

381
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:19,417
You just have to see
What you passed up.

382
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,083
Why?

383
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,958
Well, I think it's probably
better if you figure that out.

384
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,208
What if I don't Want to?

385
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,250
Of course you don't Want to.

386
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,292
Humans never Want to do
What's good for 'em.

387
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:39,042
AnyWay, it's good to be you.

388
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,833
That's What you said before.

389
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:44,042
So this is all part
of being you.

390
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:47,833
Well, that's
not good enough.

391
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:50,042
It better be 'cause that's
all you're gonna get.

392
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:52,375
Excuse me, I got Work to do.

393
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,167
Angel.

394
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:29,208
I thought you
Weren't coming.

395
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:32,750
We already prayed.
You can sit doWn.

396
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:36,042
Meatloaf, that's aWesome.

397
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,083
What are you talking about?
It's your favorite.

398
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,792
No, no, I mean it.
It's aWesome.

399
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,333
It's leaving me
in a cold sWeat

400
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,667
contemplating the culinary
triumphs still to come.

401
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:52,833
Where Were you, daddy?

402
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:55,667
If you must knoW, I Was
having an argument

403
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,042
With an angel.

404
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,250
Did he have Wings?

405
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,417
No, he had
greased-stained coveralls.

406
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,417
What?

407
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:02,750
Why, he's a mechanic.

408
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:05,042
He had bad breath
and a nine-dollar hair cut.

409
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:13,667
Mmm, this angel,
What did he say to you?

410
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,750
We both agree on Ben Walker,
but I'm not your Ben Walker.

411
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,250
See, more specifically,
I'm not your husband,

412
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,417
and I'm not their father.

413
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,792
Is daddy having
a nervous breakdoWn?

414
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,000
<i>You know, you're all
very sweet in your own</i>

415
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,667
parallel universe,
"It's a Wonderful Life"

416
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,750
sort of Way.

417
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:33,958
And if I had to choose a family
to be my make-believe family,

418
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:36,375
it Would be you.

419
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,667
Girls, go to your rooms.
Your daddy and I need to talk.

420
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,042
NoW.

421
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,167
First you move us here.

422
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,083
You uproot the girls from their
friends and home to get back

423
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:06,125
to the pastoral Work that you
Want to do for a church

424
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,750
that needs you,
and I supported you.

425
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,292
But the first thing you do When
you get here is you alienate

426
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:16,000
yourself from the congregation,
insult and ignore everyone

427
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:20,292
that talks to you, including me
and the girls,

428
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:24,167
and you act as if you
barely even knoW me.

429
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,417
Is there something
you Want to tell me?

430
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:31,250
Wendy, I knoW you're
gonna think I'm crazy,

431
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:35,833
but I'm the Ben Walker Who's
a successful investment banker

432
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:38,000
at a huge firm.

433
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:40,875
And the reason I'm having
trouble being Pastor Ben is

434
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:43,750
that I haven't set foot inside
a church in over 15 years.

435
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:47,292
In my real life, I just closed
a complex but profitable deal.

436
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,208
Our fees alone Were
only $25 million.

437
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,250
And at the moment,
I'm supposed to be

438
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,375
in Paris celebrating With...

439
00:36:57,417 --> 00:37:02,208
This Ben Walker
you're talking about,

440
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:05,125
What's he doing here?

441
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,833
Apparently, I'm supposed
to figure it out on my oWn.

442
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,875
Well, that man
you just described...

443
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:23,042
...I didn't marry him.

444
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,417
The sheets go doWn first,
then the blanket.

445
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:41,042
Gotcha.

446
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:47,833
Are you and mom
gonna get a divorce?

447
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,917
No, absolutely not.

448
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:56,333
She and I... no, no,
Why do you ask?

449
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,917
When Liv's dad
slept on the couch,

450
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:00,667
they got divorced the next Week.

451
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:08,167
Your mom and your dad,
they're... We're,

452
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,792
We're not gonna do that.

453
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,750
<i>Can I say my prayers
out here?</i>

454
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,750
Yeah, come on.

455
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:20,167
Okay.

456
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:25,375
Dear God, please bless mommy
and daddy, Who We all knoW

457
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,333
is going through a tough time
right noW and probably

458
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:31,792
<i>doesn't know that he's making
mommy sort of nervous.</i>

459
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:34,417
<i>And maybe you could help his
brain because he seems</i>

460
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:37,708
to be forgetting a lot of
stuff he should knoW.

461
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:41,792
And please bless Kimberly
and Jonah, even though I keep

462
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,083
<i>forgetting to change his water.</i>

463
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:48,083
And thank you for dying
to save us all, Amen.

464
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,792
Amen.

465
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,750
Bedtime, Megs.

466
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,042
The great What if, huh?

467
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:46,083
Well, What if I just
drove back into the city?

468
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,167
What?

469
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,750
You've got to be kidding me!

470
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:39,833
Reverend Dr. Benjamin Walker
of Clearville.

471
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:44,125
They thought of everything.

472
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,000
No, no, stay focused.
Stay focused.

473
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,667
It's meant to distract you.

474
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,708
It's not real.
It's not real.

475
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,792
No cash, What?

476
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:05,708
What, no credit cards.

477
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,833
This guy's a loser.

478
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:19,833
We're married, right?

479
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:22,708
I mean, What's yours is mine
and What's mine

480
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:25,417
isn't in my Wallet right noW.

481
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:36,333
Daddy, What are you
doing With mommy's purse?

482
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:42,042
Well, I'm... I'm just...

483
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,958
Don't go anyWhere.

484
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:57,292
No, no, no I couldn't
take that from you.

485
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,792
No, it Wouldn't be right.

486
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,167
Hey.

487
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,042
It's prepay after 11:00.

488
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,125
Yeah, I knoW.

489
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:11,167
HoW much gas
Will this get me?

490
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:17,042
Huh, huh, look at that,
huh, huh?

491
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,917
It's um...

492
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,750
...it's a dollar.

493
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:26,042
I'm sWimming in the red,
droWnin' in the blues.

494
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:30,375
I ain't rollin' in the green
like I likes to.

495
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:33,917
My piggy bank is empty.
No chicks in the coup.

496
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,417
I need a cash coW,
a little moolah, Wooh!

497
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,125
There's too much...

498
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,417
See ya.

499
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,750
Oh, come on.

500
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:54,208
You gotta be kidding me.

501
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:57,125
Are you...

502
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:01,125
Ah!

503
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,833
Oh.
Oh, great.

504
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,833
Yeah, big surprise it's Mike.

505
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,000
Yup, big surprise.

506
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,208
I'm going back to the city,
you can't stop me.

507
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,417
Don't intend to.

508
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:19,042
So you can just knock off
the tWilight zone...

509
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:20,167
You don't?

510
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,708
So you're not here
to drag me back?

511
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,417
No.

512
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,375
Boss thinks it'd be a good idea
if you just saW What the World

513
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:27,333
Would be like Without ya.

514
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,958
Come on, jump in.

515
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,417
This is a big mistake.

516
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,792
I think so too.

517
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,708
I mean for you.

518
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:53,250
See, once We get
back into the city,

519
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:57,083
this "What if" charade of yours
is all gonna fall apart

520
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,000
and I can go back to being me.

521
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,208
Ben, this isn't a trick.

522
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,167
It's not some local phenomena
like a thunderstorm Where

523
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,667
it's raining here, 10 miles aWay
it's clear and sunny.

524
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,875
<i>It's all changed.</i>

525
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,083
<i>It's different,
the whole world.</i>

526
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:11,042
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Whatever.

527
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,667
Look, I'm an angel.

528
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,875
We don't lie.
We can't lie.

529
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,833
But you do Whatever the boss
tells you to do, right?

530
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:21,125
<i>Yeah, exactly.</i>

531
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,417
So What if the boss
tells you to lie?

532
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:26,375
I don't mean a big huge,
you knoW, hurtful lie,

533
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,875
but just a teeny, teeny
little White lie?

534
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,375
WoW, never
thought about that.

535
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:36,375
You knoW, I Wonder if God could
build a rock so big

536
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:39,042
that he himself
couldn't pick it up.

537
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,917
Yeah, exactly.

538
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,417
Ben, I'm just gonna
have to let you go

539
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,917
and see for yourself, huh?

540
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:00,792
<i>So why do you want to
come back here so bad?</i>

541
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:03,208
Among many things,
have you seen Cynthia?

542
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:04,417
She's gorgeous.

543
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:06,833
Oh, not our type.

544
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,292
Not your type?

545
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,708
My life is great.
People envy me.

546
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:16,083
I get What I Want.
I love my life.

547
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,208
<i>Ironically, this little stunt
of yours has reminded me</i>

548
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:21,208
of hoW happy I am With
the choices I've made.

549
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,125
Can I help you, sir?

550
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,917
Hey, Elaine, I'm in
to see the old man.

551
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,292
Excuse me, sir.
You need to Wait here.

552
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:52,375
<i>Do you have an appointment?</i>

553
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,000
No, I'm pretty sure that
becoming partner means

554
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,792
I don't need to make
an appointment.

555
00:45:56,875 --> 00:46:00,042
Oh, Claire, can you tell me
What's going on here?

556
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:03,958
Elaine's acting like she
doesn't knoW Who I am.

557
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm sorry, and you are?

558
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,917
Oh, right, yeah, you don't
knoW Who your boss is

559
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,167
from the last 5 years.

560
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,167
Hey, Jim, Jimbo,
hoW you doin'?

561
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,042
Hey, is that Ross Bessette
in there?

562
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:17,875
Is the Bessette Industry's
deal going forWard?

563
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,042
That's none
of your business.

564
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,667
Who are you here With?

565
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,750
I'm...

566
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:25,750
Are you a reporter
or With the SEC?

567
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:28,042
Jim, seriously,
are you putting me on?

568
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:32,292
Joel, this gentleman has
an interesting question.

569
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,667
<i>He wants to know if that's
Ross Bessette in there</i>

570
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,042
of Bessette Industries.

571
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,375
It's nothing,
We're just revieWing

572
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:41,833
their foreign holdings,
tightening up their portfolio.

573
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:43,167
Okay, you knoW What?

574
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,917
This charade is over.
It's not funny anymore.

575
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,208
We all knoW that
I belong here.

576
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:53,167
I graduated top of my business
school class at Harvard.

577
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,875

579
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,375
Carry on.

580
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:05,083
Believe it or not,
We already have all

581
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:08,667
the biblical archaeologists
on staff that We need.

582
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,083
If you'll excuse me,
I'm running late.

583
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:11,917
Love the jeans.

584
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
<i>Soda water.
I need soda water.</i>

585
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,125
<i>What happened?</i>

586
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,375
<i>Oh, some soccer mom let her
little brat spill juice</i>

587
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:20,792
all over my neW Versace.

588
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,708
What is this?

589
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:25,000
Of course, she doesn't
remember me either, right?

590
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:29,417
Yeah, okay, last time I saW you,
I Was your Benny bear.

591
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:30,667
Benny bear? > >

592
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,042
That's my fiancée you're
speaking to, Barney bear.

593
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,042
Fiancée, What?
This guy?

594
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,417
Are you kidding me?

595
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,083
You're engaged to me.

596
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:39,292
Oh, really?

597
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,875
Yes, We met 2 years ago
on your father's yacht

598
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,000
in the Caymans.

599
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,167
You Were Wearing
your purple bikini.

600
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,708
I Was having Way
too many Mojitos.

601
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,042
I have never laid eyes on
you before in my life,

602
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:53,333
unless, of course, you detailed
my car or served me coffee?

603
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:57,208
NoW you knoW Why
I love this Woman.

604
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,750
You knoW, if they continue
With this behavior,

605
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,875
their application for Weeping
and gnashing of teeth

606
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:04,125
Will be approved.

607
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,292
<i>All right, I'm
not leaving here.</i>

608
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,333
I'm not leaving here.

609
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:12,167
Call security.

610
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,875
<i>Seventeenth floor, please.</i>

611
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:25,125
You got a black Benz too.
Are you kidding me?

612
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:28,042
<i>Hey, hey, this isn't over!</i>

613
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,083
I did it once
and I'll do it again!

614
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,875
<i>I'll build this place up.</i>

615
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,125
- I'm gonna...
- Ben.

616
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,167
What?

617
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,708
You're embarrassing
yourself.

618
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,833
Well, you're
embarrassing yourself.

619
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,292
Oh, it's not like
I didn't Warn ya.

620
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:45,292
Well, you Were
a big help.

621
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,833
Look, I need you
to close your eyes

622
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:49,708
<i>and count backward
from a hundred.</i>

623
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:51,042
<i>I'll take care of the van.</i>

624
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,875
No, I'm not
going back there.

625
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,792
You can't make me.

626
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,875
Oh, I love sloW learners.

627
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:00,833
Look, Cynthia's
coming back.

628
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:01,750
That's not Cynth...

629
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,333
<i>Little twirp's been
in my closet again.</i>

630
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:04,417
<i>I was not!</i>

631
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,167
<i>Your sister is not a twirp.</i>

632
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,750
<i>You're right, mom,
she's a stupid twirp.</i>

633
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:11,208
I am not stupid.

634
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,750
You go apologize to your
sister and then come back

635
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:16,750
doWnstairs for breakfast
and apologize to me.

636
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:20,042
<i>Of course you take her side.</i>

637
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:29,167
Any idea What my morning
looks like?

638
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:33,042
Ten a. M.,
commitment testing?

639
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,750
We're meeting With
Brittney and Carl,

640
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,167
the couple that Wants
to get married.

641
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,208
Commitment testing?

642
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,000
Right, you knoW hoW, you knoW,
from your standpoint,

643
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:47,417
Would you best describe
commitment testing?

644
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:50,208
To discourage them from
making the Wrong decision,

645
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:52,292
if they're unequally yoked.

646
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,208
Shake 'em up a little.

647
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,875
Yeah.

648
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:01,042
Daddy, Why did Jonah die?

649
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,750
Well, I don't knoW, maybe he
didn't love Jesus

650
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,208
the Way fish are supposed to.

651
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:08,333
Mommy, my goldfish
is in hell!

652
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:10,375
Really?

653
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:14,833
Megan.

654
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,875
Probably not the best thing
to say, huh?

655
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:22,208
I thought
it Was funny.

656
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,750
<i>"Then the Lord God made
a woman from the rib</i>

657
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:29,750
<i>"he had taken out of the man
and he brought her to the man.</i>

658
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,375
"The man said, this is noW bone
of my bones

659
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:34,417
"and flesh of my flesh.

660
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:40,208
"She shall be called Woman,
for she Was taken out of man.

661
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:44,208
"For this reason, a man Will
leave his father and mother

662
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,875
"and be united to his Wife.

663
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:50,000
"And they Will become one flesh.

664
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:53,875
The man and his Wife Were both
naked and they felt no shame. "

665
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,917
NoW, that's What
I'm talking about, hmm?

666
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:07,000
But seriously, Carl,
Why do you Want to get married?

667
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,042
Because We love each other.

668
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:15,042
Want my opinion?

669
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:19,042
This is isn't love.
It's hormones.

670
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:23,417
Carl, hoW much money
do you make per month?

671
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:24,708
What?

672
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:25,750
I'm guessing your
after-tax income

673
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,917
isn't much more than 3K,
am I right?

674
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,208
It's something like that.

675
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:31,750
And once you bring
your girl into the mix,

676
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:32,833
the monthly net doubles.

677
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,250
I mean, that's not gonna
kill you, but once she's got

678
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:36,292
a bun in the oven
and stops Working,

679
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:37,750
are you gonna
be ready for that?

680
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,667
And even if We assume that
you get your income up

681
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,750
the typical 10% over
the next couple of years,

682
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,417
that's not gonna be nearly
enough to protect you from

683
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:46,167
all the money arguments that
cause over 50% of divorces.

684
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,000
And then you tWo are gonna be
back in here saying,

685
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,875
"Pastor Ben, Pastor Ben,
Why didn't you stop us?

686
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:53,250
Why didn't you stage some
sort of intervention?"

687
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:58,375
He's just playing
devil's advocate.

688
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:02,000
See, When the Lord
blesses a union,

689
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:05,208
he sends a thousand little
consolations every day,

690
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,875
most of Which We never
even really notice.

691
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,875
Grace is to help us endure
the trials of life

692
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:15,167
and learn to treasure
the precious moments

693
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,958
along the Way.

694
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:21,875
They're his Way of
letting us knoW, to him,

695
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:26,292
marriage is sacred
and it is special.

696
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:27,958
Yeah, special.

697
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:30,125
It's like that 4 by 4
you drove up in.

698
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:33,333
I bet you're fond of that, huh?

699
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,708
Yeah, I love that truck.

700
00:52:35,792 --> 00:52:37,250
Brittney loves me in it.

701
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:40,250
Mm-hmm, a year from noW,
it's a minivan.

702
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,000
Trust me on this.
Attractive, right?

703
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,792
It's hard to look hot
When your ride

704
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,833
has child safety
seats, isn't it?

705
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,208
Yeah.

706
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,833
What?

707
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,000
Well, that Went Well.

708
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,042
You Wanted me
to push 'em, right?

709
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,833
Within biblical parameters.

710
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:24,708
Ben, you compared marriage
to life imprisonment

711
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,042
Without the possibility
of parole.

712
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:28,292
What's next?

713
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,333
You gonna reWrite
the beatitudes?

714
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:33,792
"Blessed are they Who remain
single for they can be

715
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,417
"as selfish as they Want
drinking beer

716
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:40,750
and Watching ESPN all night"?

717
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:45,208
Where did that come from?

718
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:49,292
I feel like I don't
even knoW you right noW.

719
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:57,333
Kimberly, What's going on?

720
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:58,417
Dillon just dropped me off.

721
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,042
Why?

722
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:02,000
Everybody's talking about me.

723
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:05,167
What?
Why?

724
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,667
Daddy paid Dillon Jordan,
the most popular guy

725
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,292
in Clearville, $80 to
stay aWay from me.

726
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,208
Please tell me
that isn't true.

727
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,292
I kneW I should have
given him a hundred.

728
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,792
He Wasn't supposed
to say anything.

729
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:22,042
HoW could you?

730
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,083
This is the Worst thing
that's ever happened to me,

731
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:25,375
and it's all because of you.

732
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:27,125
Kimberly.

733
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,792
Ben, are you kidding me?

734
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:31,875
You told me to handle it.

735
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,208
I didn't mean to hurt her.

736
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,292
<i>Kimberly!</i>

737
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:41,042
I don't knoW hoW to do this.

738
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:43,292
The Bessettes have alWays
been stubborn about staying

739
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:46,292
a family business and not
being oWned by anyone else.

740
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:49,125
And in this case, it's
going to be their doWnfall.

741
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:51,875
<i>You'd be wise to avoid
purchasing any of their stock</i>

742
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,667
<i>until this situation
is settled.</i>

743
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,417
Couch again, huh?

744
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:59,042
Actually, it's more of
a doghouse than a couch.

745
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:01,167
It's your fault.

746
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,875
I knoW.

747
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:04,042
Any piece of their company.

748
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:06,125
Quite frankly, I think
they're in trouble.

749
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:09,167
Why are you
Watching this?

750
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,750
Bessette Industries is about
to become a takeover target.

751
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,792
Is that good?

752
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:20,833
I used to think so,
but I don't knoW noW.

753
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:24,042
Don't Worry,
it's all gonna Work out.

754
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:25,750
Ya think?

755
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:28,750
Hey, sugar bear.

756
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,167
Daddy and I have to have
a little talk.

757
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:33,667
Will you go upstairs
and get ready for bed?

758
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,833
Oh, thank you.

759
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,292
Where's mine?

760
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:50,042
I Wanted to ask you something.

761
00:55:55,208 --> 00:56:00,167
Do you still like us,
this family?

762
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,958
Of course, I do.

763
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:11,792
Then Why are you
acting like this?

764
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:16,708
You knoW, back When you
Were still at Moody,

765
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,833
Dr. Heron's Wife, When she heard
We Were getting married, she

766
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:22,917
pulled me aside and she said,
"If you're gonna

767
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,167
"marry a minister, you need
to knoW about the moment.

768
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:33,333
"Every man Who dedicates
his life to ministry goes

769
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:40,792
"through one, When he questions
if he's been Wrong

770
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:47,792
about everything,
including his faith. "

771
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,375
Unless I'm Wrong...

772
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:53,208
This is my moment.

773
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:04,750
Will you read this to me?

774
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:07,042
Right there.

775
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:21,875
"Love is patient.
Love is kind.

776
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:27,875
"It does not envy.
It does not boast.

777
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:36,875
"Is not rude,
not self-seeking.

778
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:44,875
"Is not easily angered.
Keeps no records of Wrongs.

779
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:51,708
"Love does not delight in evil,
but rejoices With the truth.

780
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:58,167
"It alWays protects,
alWays trusts, alWays hopes,

781
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:01,125
alWays perseveres. "

782
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,875
NoW Which one of those
Would you say best

783
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:14,333
describes you lately?

784
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:25,833
Ben, this life is a life
that We chose together.

785
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:34,917
Minister, husband, father,
mother, Wife, friend.

786
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:43,167
NoW We're in this
for the long haul,

787
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:47,750
but if you're there's some
changes that you Want to make

788
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:50,292
about Where We're going
and What We're doing,

789
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:52,958
then We need to talk about it.

790
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:54,292
I'm not saying
I'm gonna like it,

791
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:59,167
but We need to talk about it.

792
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,208
I'm not gonna let you keep
doing What you're doing,

793
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:08,750
torturing yourself and
everybody else around you.

794
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:14,167
I don't Want it for me.

795
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:20,208
And I Won't let you
do it to our girls.

796
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,875
Do you understand?

797
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:30,333
Yeah, yes.
Yeah.

798
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:53,750
<i>Hey, this thing
isn't working.</i>

799
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:54,875
This thing?

800
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,292
<i>Yeah, this what if?</i>

801
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:57,750
I mean, my kids hate me.

802
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,417
Wendy's convinced that I don't
love her anymore.

803
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:02,125
I divide my time betWeen
saying stupid things

804
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,292
<i>and doing stupid things.</i>

805
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:06,000
<i>And the church,
the church is a disaster.</i>

806
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:07,417
<i>I mean, it's a race to see
which happens first,</i>

807
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,750
the villagers grab torches
and pitchforks

808
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:12,333
or I reduce the congregation
to zero.

809
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:15,208
You need to end it.

810
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:17,208
It's not even close
to my decision.

811
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:20,917
<i>But I'm hurting these people,
and I don't want to hurt them.</i>

812
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,750
I mean, I keep doing
everything Wrong,

813
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:24,750
I mean everything.

814
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:29,708
That's simple,
do everything right.

815
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,042
But that's ridiculous.

816
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,292
Exactly.

817
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:33,875
NoW you're on the right track.

818
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,333
You're not even
listening to me.

819
01:00:35,417 --> 01:00:38,292
I can't be the Ben
that they think I am.

820
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,917
Look, the guy Who
Won Wendy's heart,

821
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,667
the father of those children
didn't do anything

822
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,708
you're not capable of
by definition.

823
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:47,708
<i>Yeah, but I'm not him.</i>

824
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:50,083
Yeah, that's because
you don't Want to be.

825
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,667
You Want to be like him?

826
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,708
Then study him.
Learn from him.

827
01:00:53,792 --> 01:00:55,750
<i>Read what he read.
Feel what he felt.</i>

828
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:59,333
Then maybe, maybe you'll
discover that you are him.

829
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:01,667
Can't be that simple.

830
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,875
Oh, you Want
to make it harder?

831
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,708
All right, simple, huh?

832
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:07,750
HoW's this?

833
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:10,042
Everything in life
boils doWn to this,

834
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:16,792
<i>God loves you,
so love other people.</i>

835
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:21,042
God sacrificed everything
to be With you,

836
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:25,042
so sacrifice everything.

837
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,375
That's not simple.

838
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:33,417
It is, it's just hard.

839
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:42,792
Okay, you knoW,
When this is all over,

840
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:46,292
I can still go back
to my old life?

841
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:49,833
Well, yeah, if
that's What you Want.

842
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:53,000
God's call alWays
involves a choice.

843
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:56,875
You can alWays say no,
in fact, you already have.

844
01:01:56,958 --> 01:02:01,417
You knoW, When you Walked aWay,
you broke tWo hearts,

845
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:03,167
<i>Wendy's and his.</i>

846
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,875
<i>Now he's giving you
anotherchance,</i>

847
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:07,250
<i>and you're not getting
out of this until you</i>

848
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:10,417
totally embrace the situation.

849
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:14,958
Total surrender,
even on a trial basis.

850
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:18,417
And then if you Want to go,
my guess is he'll let ya,

851
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,250
if that's What you really Want.

852
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:30,250
Total surrender.

853
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:37,250
You knoW, you're
pretty tough for an angel.

854
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:40,958
Yeah, Well, you ought
to read your Bible, Ben.

855
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:42,875
Book of Genesis.

856
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:44,875
It Was a cherub that delivered
the eviction notice

857
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:46,125
in the garden of Eden.

858
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:47,792
And that Was a cherub.

859
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:50,417
Let's not even talk
about the seraphim.

860
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:53,042
So are you a...

861
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:54,292
<i>Seraphim?</i>

862
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,750
Yeah, seraphim.

863
01:02:56,833 --> 01:03:00,375
I mean, Where do you rank?

864
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:03,792
Did they send me
someone important?

865
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:07,167
Well, the fact that I'm
sitting here babysitting you

866
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,958
should tell you Where I rank.

867
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,750
Oh, What are you doing?

868
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:03,000
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

869
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,167
Well, can I
fix you something?

870
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:10,167
Some bacon and eggs, maybe?

871
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:13,708
Sure, thanks.

872
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:35,208
I haven't seen you like this
since you Were in seminary.

873
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:40,000
What's gotten into you?

874
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:45,208
I guess you could
say Ben Walker.

875
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:11,292
Is this my turn coming up?

876
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:16,208
Uh, hello, WoodroW Wilson.
You only graduated from there.

877
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:20,042
I just Wanted to make sure
they didn't move it.

878
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,292
Yeah, dad.

879
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,833
They moved it across toWn

880
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:25,167

885
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:07,792
<i>This hasn't been easy.</i>

886
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:12,208
<i>I mean, I know in my heart
that you brought us together.</i>

887
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:20,167

893
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:05,833
Hey, Charlie.

OWe on gas, electric bill.

Oh, the termite inspector's

898
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,042
<i>And?</i>

899
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:18,208
And We are a home
to a number

900
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:21,042
of the Lord's smaller creatures.

901
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:22,875
So hoW much to get
rid of 'em?

902
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:25,750
<i>Well, three times what we've
got in the general account.</i>

903
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,875
Insurance fund?

904
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:28,000
<i>Empty.</i>

905
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,667
Building fund?

906
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:33,750
Don't make me laugh.

907
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:37,833
Well, maybe, you knoW,
the Lord Will see us through.

908

910
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:49,042
Your Words,
Pastor, not mine.

911
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,292
Hmm.

912
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:30,833
I better be right about this.

913
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,708
Surprise!

914
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,417
Ooh.

915
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:53,667
Oh, I bleW out your candle.

916
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,208
<i>Is that carrot cake?</i>

917
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,833
I love carrot cake.

918
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:59,083

<i>Axelrod's cream
cheese icing?</i>

920
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:02,750
Yeah.

921
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:06,333
And it Was very hard to
find here, I might add.

922
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:07,958
You're not out of the Woods,
but We Wouldn't

923
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:11,000

01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,292
Thank this one.

926
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:16,708
She's the one Who shredded
the carrots, and her finger.

927
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,042
Oh, I'm sorry, sWeetie.

928
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:20,667
It's okay.

929
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,208
And I knoW that We're tight
on money and We said no gifts,

930
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,833
but Charlie had this softWare
on his computer

931
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:29,875
and he helped me With this.

932
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,708
Thanks.

First Word, fleW

01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,417
Oh, yeah, I could get it.

987
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:21,167
Okay, What's next?

<i>There's a...

01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:43,667

01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:46,417
I got...

997
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:53,917
We got 'em pretty good, huh?

998
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Hey kiddo.

999
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:54,708
<i>Hi dad.</i>

1000
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:56,042
You got a minute?

1001
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:58,750
Sure.

1002
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,417
What's that?

1003
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:03,833
That's a fish tank.

1004
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:06,167
I mean, What's it for?

1005
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:09,750
Well, I happened to be
Walking past a pet store

1006
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:15,167
and I accidentally Went inside,
and apparently, I bought this.

1007
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,208
The gravel's
pink and purple.

1008
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,208
Yeah, I figured
you'd like that.

1009
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:22,208
You see, it's got a lot
of space, has a filter.

1010
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:25,042
There's even a little bubbler,
you knoW,

1011
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:26,375
give him a lot of air.

1012
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:29,417
And then there's even a little
heater, in case he gets cold.

1013
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:31,875
But Jonah's gone.

1014
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:34,125
I knoW.

1015
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:40,375
But this guy still needs a home,
and I thought, you knoW,

1016
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:43,417
maybe he could stay With us.

1017
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:46,667
What should We call him?

1018
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:51,167
Well, I Was thinking maybe
Jonah the second?

1019
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:56,042
Or Jonah Jr?
Or little Jonah?

1020
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,375
Do you think Jonah Would mind
if little Jonah has

1021
01:15:58,417 --> 01:16:00,208
his treasure chest?

1022
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,750
Hmm.

1023
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:06,333
I think he'd Want
him to have it.

1024
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:13,667
Love you, daddy.

1025
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,333
<i>Megan, stay still, please.</i>

1026
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:42,417
Where's Kimberly?

1027
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:43,667
She's still upstairs.

1028
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:46,875
Okay, I'll go get her.

1029
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:57,958
Don't think I'm
not still mad at you.

1030
01:16:58,042 --> 01:17:01,250
I knoW, you should be.

1031
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:02,333
I should?

1032
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:03,750
Sure.

1033
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:04,875
You're not a little girl
anymore, and I shouldn't

1034
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,000
treat you like one.

1035
01:17:07,042 --> 01:17:08,875
Does that mean I get to go
to Angelina Buckner's

1036
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,083
homecoming party?

1037
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,292
No, It doesn't
mean that at all.

1038
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,750
I'm pretty sure your mom
Wouldn't approve,

1039
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:14,167
and neither do I.

1040
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:16,125
See, that's the problem.

1041
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:18,000
You say I'm not a little girl
anymore, but you treat me

1042
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:21,000
<i>like one anyways.</i>

1043
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,875
What's that?

1044
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:29,667
It's tWo tickets
to the Toby Mac concert

1045
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:32,250
at the stadium.

1046
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:34,875
It's because you're not
a little girl anymore.

1047
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:40,208
I don't have
anyone to go With.

1048
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:42,250
Actually, there's a guy
Who'd really like

1049
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:45,208
to go With you.

1050
01:17:45,292 --> 01:17:46,750
Who?

1051
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,208
Dillon.

1052
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,417
Dillon?

1053
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,250
Yes, that Dillon,
the I gave him $80

1054
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:55,125
to stay aWay from you, Dillon.

1055
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:58,833
But What if he
doesn't Want to...

1056
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,417
<i>Oh, he does.</i>

1057
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:05,167
I already talked to him,
trust me, he Wants to go.

1058
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,250
You didn't...

1059
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:07,333
No, I didn't pay him.

1060
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:09,000
What do you think I'm crazy?

1061
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:11,167
<i>Okay, and this is not a date.</i>

1062
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:16,000
I'm gonna have Wendy, your mom,
drive you, and she's gonna sit

1063
01:18:16,042 --> 01:18:18,000
a feW roWs behind you
along With his mom.

1064
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:20,167
But I Won't be Within a hundred
miles so you don't have

1065
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,333
<i>to worry about me, you know,
messing things up.</i>

1066
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,833
Thanks, daddy.

1067
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:33,917
You're Welcome.

1068
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,167
Come on, let's go.

1069
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,417
Pastor has to be
on time, right?

1070
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:43,333
<i>So there's Moses, he's
minding his own business.</i>

1071
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:47,250
He's tending his sheep,
Whatever that means.

1072
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:50,417
He's, you knoW, poking
at them With a stick.

1073
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:52,083
He's Whistling at them.

1074
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:56,083
He's doing something.
He's tending to them.

1075
01:18:56,167 --> 01:19:01,167
And he sees a burning bush.

1076
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:05,042
Be a little freaky,
it's a burning bush,

1077
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,750
and it speaks and it's God.

1078
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:11,167
And god says, "Moses,
take off your shoes.

1079
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:14,667
<i>This is holy ground. "</i>

1080
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,000
And he did.

1081
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:19,167
And God said, "I've seen
the pain and heard the cries

1082
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:23,000
"of my people in Egypt,
and I'm going to deliver them

1083
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:24,292
"from the hand of Pharaoh.

1084
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:29,292
And you are hoW I Will do it. "

1085
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,708
Whoa.

1086
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:35,667
And Moses said, "But Lord,
I'm a Wanted man in Egypt. "

1087
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:38,042
<i>And God said, "I don't care. "</i>

1088
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:40,833
<i>"But Lord, this is
no ordinary man.</i>

1089
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:41,875
This is Ramses. "

1090
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:43,292
And God said, "I don't care. "

1091
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:47,417
"But Lord, I can't speak. "

1092
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:51,375
And God said,
"Your brother Aaron

1093
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:52,750
"Will speak for you.

1094
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:58,375
"And you knoW, by the Way,
Who are you to tell me,

1095
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:04,042
"Who made you, What I can
and cannot accomplish in you?

1096
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:10,042
"For your greatest Weakness
is my greatest strength.

1097
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:14,167
And I Will be With you. "

1098
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,833
NoW, do We let God
say that to us?

1099
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:29,917
And do We listen When he does?

1100
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,292
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

1101
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:32,917
Thank you.

1102
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,125
Thank you so much.

1103
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:36,333
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1104
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:37,417
Thank you, have a good day.

1105
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,167
Hey, look at you guys.

1106
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,333
Yeah, I got a little handshake.

1107
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:41,750
That's nice, thank you.

1108
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:42,833
Thank you very much.

1109
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,875
Pleasure.
Thank you.

1110
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:46,250
<i>Thanks for stopping by.</i>

1111
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:47,375
HoW'd We do?

1112
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:50,417
If I Was a termite, I'd be
preparing to meet my maker.

1113
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:55,167
All right.

1114
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,292
<i>Pastor Ben.</i>

1115
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:06,292
Hey, just Want to thank you.

1116
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:07,750
For?

1117
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:10,125
<i>Shaking us up during
the commitment testing.</i>

1118
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:12,750
Making us think about some of
the things that We're facing.

1119
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:14,292
It Was pure genius.

1120
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:16,042
I have to admit,
it actually Worked.

1121
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:18,667
<i>I went home to my mom looking
for a little bit of sympathy,</i>

1122
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,833
<i>and she was on your side.</i>

1123
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,833
She said most girls spend more
of their time thinking of their

1124
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:26,833
bridesmaid colors instead of
the stuff that really matters.

1125
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:30,292
What did you decide?

1126
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:33,167
We traded in the truck
for a minivan.

1127
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:34,167
Really?

1128
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,042
<i>We figured we might
as well get a head start.</i>

1129
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,750
Well, congratulations.

1130
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:40,042
Thank you.

1131
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:41,875
Huh?

1132
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:43,167
What can I say?

1133
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:46,667
I'm good at What I do.
Thank you.

1134
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:49,333
Thank you so much for coming.
It's good to see you again.

1135
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:56,417
This is the most romantic
thing you've ever done.

1136
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,875
And since When do you knoW
hoW to do a cordon bleu

1137
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,708
in mornay sauce?

1138
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:03,083
Well, since the Clearville
house of pizza doesn't deliver,

1139
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:06,375
I kneW I had to come up
With something.

1140
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:10,750
Well, Ben Walker,
you are something else.

1141
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:15,250
Take a Walk With me.

1142
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,250
Okay.

1143
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,333
Remember this place?

1144
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,833
Our first kiss?

1145
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:32,333
I've been checking out
places around toWn

1146
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:35,375
that remind me of When
We first started dating,

1147
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:39,250
even the bad spots
like the bus station.

1148
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:42,208
Oh, I don't consider
that a bad spot.

1149
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:43,875
That's Where
We said good-bye.

1150
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,708
Almost.

1151
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:48,125
I still remember
the bus driver's annoyed face

1152
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:50,292
When you made him stop.

1153
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:52,167
So I never left?

1154
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:55,417
I knoW you Weren't sure
about it all, but I really feel

1155
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:58,167
like We avoided making
some bad decisions

1156
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:00,417
that We Would have regretted.

1157
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:04,667
And that's Why
We ended up here.

1158
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:08,375
Do you ever regret it?

1159
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:11,292
We'll, you knoW, I've had
a recent odd spell,

1160
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:13,833
a really long one, actually.

1161
01:23:13,917 --> 01:23:18,208
But I'm rapidly
coming out of it.

1162
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:21,000
Come here.

1163
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,750
What is this?

1164
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:28,750
It's for you.

1165
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:31,167
Thank you.

1166
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:36,292
When We Were first together
years ago, I felt like

1167
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:39,833
I Was alWays trying
to get aWay from here.

1168
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:42,417
<i>And I think lately I've been
missing some of that fast life</i>

1169
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:45,833
I Was trying to get to.

1170
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:50,667
But I Want to recommit to What
We're doing and to our home,

1171
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:56,167
to What you Wrote in my Bible.

1172
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,708
It's beautiful.

1173
01:23:59,792 --> 01:24:01,333
We're gonna start some
Work on the house next Week.

1174
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:07,042
I've already spoken
to a contractor.

1175
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,792
What are you talking about?

1176
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,083
We can't afford that.

1177
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:13,375
Well, I took out the $837 We
had in the checking account.

1178
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:15,417
Ben, that's all We had.

1179
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:17,875
Well, not anymore.

1180
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:20,292
There's this company called
Bessette Industries,

1181
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:24,208
and I kneW they Were about
to be taken over so I bought

1182
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,292
a chunk of call options.

1183
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:29,750
The stock price Went up 24%,
18% above the strike price

1184
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:33,917
so I exercised my option for...
I am losing you, aren't I?

1185
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:39,000
HoW do you knoW
about all this stuff?

1186
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:43,042
The Lord Works
in mysterious Ways.

1187
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:47,167
So hoW much did We earn?

1188
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:50,792
Well, enough to put the $837
back in the checking account

1189
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:53,333
and make a generous donation
to the termite fund,

1190
01:24:53,417 --> 01:25:00,167
and enough to take care of a feW
small things around the house.

1191
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:02,167
WoW.

1192
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:09,417
Is it Weird that I find this
incredibly romantic right noW?

1193
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:12,042
No.

1194
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:22,292
Wendy.

1195
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,167
<i>Ben, I'm sorry.</i>

1196
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:26,167
There's an emergency
doWn at the hospital.

1197
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:27,917
We gotta go.

1198
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,208
But...

1199
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,792
<i>There's a guy down there
that needs you.</i>

1200
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:33,125
He's dying.

1201
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,333
We don't have much time.

1202
01:25:35,417 --> 01:25:36,708
No, you go.

1203
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:37,833
Go do What you have to.

1204
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:42,208
I'll be at the house
Waiting for you.

1205
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:43,250
I'll be back.

1206
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:45,958
- Okay.
- Soon as I can.

1207
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:53,792
This is some sort
of joke, right?

1208
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:54,833
No, it's no joke.

1209
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:56,000
The guy's considered God
in the past

1210
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:58,042
but he's alWays rejected him
and noW he thinks it's too late.

1211
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:00,125
Whether he knoWs it or not,
he's more open noW than ever.

1212
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:01,292
Why don't you
handle it yourself?

1213
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:02,375
That's not hoW
it Works, Ben.

1214
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:04,375
I do the angel stuff.
You do the people stuff.

1215
01:26:04,417 --> 01:26:07,208
By the Way, here's your Bible.

1216
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:10,833
But...

1217
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:33,833
Hi.

1218
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:35,125
Hi, may I help you?

1219
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:37,792
Yeah, What's his name?

1220
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:39,958
Henryk Zimmerman.

1221
01:26:40,042 --> 01:26:41,667
He hasn't had any visitors.

1222
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:42,833
You're the first.

1223
01:26:42,917 --> 01:26:45,708
And the last.

1224
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:48,417
What he's saying is that
We just knoW that

1225
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:50,417
he's in bad shape.

1226
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:55,042
It's okay.
I'm a clergyman.

1227
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:58,042
Oh, you're the neW one over
at the Little White Church.

1228
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,292
Yeah, that's me.

1229
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:02,042
Room 314,
right doWn the hall.

1230
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:05,292
We have him alone.
He doesn't like company.

1231
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:07,292
Difficult patient?

1232
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:09,417
Some of our Wealthier
patients are a little used

1233
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:12,792
to having their oWn Way.

1234
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:14,875
If I Was him, I'd be looking
for a very small camel

1235
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:17,250
and a very large needle.

1236
01:27:22,417 --> 01:27:24,875
Ah, like I said, he's neW.

1237
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:38,917
What do you Want?

1238
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,708
I didn't ask for a priest.

1239
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:42,833
Well, I'm not, actually.

1240
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:46,333
I'm the same league,
different team.

1241
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:49,167
Oh.

1242
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:52,292
I don't think it's
gonna do you any good.

1243
01:27:52,375 --> 01:27:54,833
You're maxed out.

1244
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:57,125
Can you fix it?

1245
01:27:57,208 --> 01:27:59,208
Sorry.

1246
01:27:59,292 --> 01:28:01,875
<i>Then get out of here.</i>

1247
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:03,708
Or did you come to tell me
I have a soul

1248
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:06,417
and you're gonna save it?

1249
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:10,875
You are a soul.
You have a body.

1250
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:14,167
Not for long.

1251
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:23,333
HoW Would you like to tick
off some religious people?

1252
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:31,000
There's a story in here
I just read,

1253
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:33,792
the parable of
the vineyard oWner.

1254
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,417
It's this rich guy.

1255
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:38,750
He oWns a vineyard, and he
needs some men to Work it

1256
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,167
so he hires some early
in the morning.

1257
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:42,792
Goes in the marketplace
around 10:00 a. M.,

1258
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:45,375
he sees some more Workers,
and he hires them too.

1259
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:48,083
Same things happen again at
noon then again at 3:00,

1260
01:28:48,167 --> 01:28:49,875
then again at 5:00.

1261
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:54,000
At the end of the day, he lines
'em all up so he can pay them,

1262
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:57,833
starting With the ones
he hired last.

1263
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:01,333
He gives them a full
day's Wage.

1264
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:03,417
And the guys that he hired
first in the morning,

1265
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:05,042
that actually Worked
a full day, figured

1266
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:08,792
"WoW, We're gonna get
a lot more money. "

1267
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,375
That seems fair.

1268
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:14,708
But When they got paid, they
got paid the same amount

1269
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:17,292
that the guys Who just Worked
one hour got paid,

1270
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:19,792
and they Were ticked.

1271
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,417
And the oWner said, "Well,
What's it matter to you

1272
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:23,083
"What I pay the other guys?

1273
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:27,875
I kept my deal With you. "

1274
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:31,875
See, the vineyard oWner is God.

1275
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:33,875
The Wages are entering
into heaven.

1276
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:38,083
So the point is it doesn't
matter Whether you come to God

1277
01:29:38,167 --> 01:29:45,042
late or early,
you get the same reWard.

1278
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:48,875
But this is last call.

1279
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:52,833
I Wasn't alWays
in this business.

1280
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:54,208
I used to be an
investment banker.

1281
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,917
Lots of money, expensive toys.

1282
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,875
Something you can
probably relate to.

1283
01:29:58,917 --> 01:30:01,208
Yeah, maybe.

1284
01:30:01,292 --> 01:30:03,708
What Was it too hot in
the kitchen for you?

1285
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:07,750
No, no, I did just fine,
but there Wasn't any life in it.

1286
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:11,417
I spent years thinking
that I Was happy,

1287
01:30:11,708 --> 01:30:15,292
but I didn't knoW
What happy meant.

1288
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:18,000
See, there's more to life.

1289
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:21,083
There are second chances
and there's forgiveness.

1290
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:27,375
It is real, Henryk,
and I don't think

1291
01:30:27,417 --> 01:30:30,667
I realized it 'til
right at this moment.

1292
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:35,042
<i>Forgiveness, huh?</i>

1293
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:39,375
I don't deserve that.
I've done things.

1294
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:43,875
You knoW What?
We all have.

1295
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:47,000
We don't have much time,
so I'm gonna cut to the chase.

1296
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:48,292
<i>I'm gonna give you
some more stuff</i>

1297
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:51,750
<i>that I've learned
from the gospels.</i>

1298
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:57,042
Judas, he Was a friend of Jesus,
but he betrayed him

1299
01:30:57,125 --> 01:31:01,042
to the death, for money,
and not much money at that.

1300
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:04,333
But the Lord is still Willing
to forgive him, I mean really,

1301
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:07,333
really Wanted to forgive him,
if only he Would ask,

1302
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:09,875
but he didn't.

1303
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:14,875
<i>He just felt so much guilt.
And now it's too late.</i>

1304
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:19,875
So Whatever you've done doesn't
compare to What Judas did.

1305
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:25,917
But God is Willing, and he's
looking to forgive you as Well.

1306
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:32,375
Well, hoW Would
We do this?

1307
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:34,958
I mean if We...

1308
01:31:35,042 --> 01:31:39,875
Honestly, I'm pretty
neW to this myself,

1309
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:44,000
so maybe We can Work
through it together.

1310
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:46,250
But it's simple.

1311
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:50,083
I mean, there is no magic spell.

1312
01:31:50,167 --> 01:31:53,250
I mean, God knoWs your
intentions, and I think

1313
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:57,875
if you admit all the Wrong
you've done in your life

1314
01:31:57,958 --> 01:32:03,292
<i>and ask him with a sincere
heart to forgive you,</i>

1315
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:06,333
I knoW he Will.

1316
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:12,333
That's not simple.

1317
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:17,750
Yeah, it is.
It's just hard.

1318
01:32:18,208 --> 01:32:20,958
<i>Your guy's pretty good.</i>

1319
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,750
Yeah, but that's my line.

1320
01:32:23,833 --> 01:32:25,167
Oh, yeah?

1321
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:26,250
It's a good one.

1322
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,917
Thanks.

1323
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,417
Still, 68 years I've been
trying to get my guy

1324
01:32:31,708 --> 01:32:33,833
to come on our side.

1325
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:36,375
Your guy's doing it
in just 5 minutes.

1326
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:39,750
Oh, probably helps that
your guy can see my guy.

1327
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:43,958
Granted.
But he's still good.

1328
01:32:44,042 --> 01:32:45,375
I like him.

1329
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:48,875
Yeah.
Me too.

1330
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:50,875
<i>Dear God.</i>

1331
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:53,375
<i>Dear God.</i>

1332
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:56,875
I believe that you're
the one true God.

1333
01:32:56,958 --> 01:33:00,750
I believe that.
I believe that.

1334
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:05,667
I believe that the Bible is
true and Jesus is my Savior.

1335
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:10,875
I believe that the Bible
is true and...

1336
01:33:12,042 --> 01:33:13,833
Jesus is.

1337
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:17,958
<i>And Jesus is my Savior.</i>

1338
01:33:19,042 --> 01:33:21,833
Do you Want to
take it from here?

1339
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:25,917
Oh, no, no, no, I'm
doing fine folloWing you.

1340
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,250
All right.

1341
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:35,875
Would it be okay if I folloW
you quietly in my head?

1342
01:33:35,958 --> 01:33:38,708
> Yeah.

1343
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,667
That counts, I'm sure.

1344
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:43,292
Okay.

1345
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:51,875
God, I'm glad
that you love me

1346
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:55,875
and that you're there for me.

1347
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:05,792
I'm sorry for the bad things
that I've done.

1348
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:12,708
For being so selfish, for
ignoring you for so long

1349
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:17,417
<i>and missing out on everything
that you wanted from me.</i>

1350
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:22,750
I Was so stupid.

1351
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:29,208
Thank you for giving me
a second chance.

1352
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:36,167
Thank you for letting me
make things right,

1353
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:39,208
even though I don't
deserve it all.

1354
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:51,750
I Want to be yours from noW on.
I truly do.

1355
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:07,375
Is there anything
you Want t add?

1356
01:35:07,417 --> 01:35:10,375
No, no, that Was perfect.

1357
01:35:12,167 --> 01:35:15,750
All right, then, Amen.

1358
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:19,875
<i>Amen.</i>

1359
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:22,917
- Amen.
- Amen.

1360
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:29,833
So that's it?

1361
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:35,958
Thank you.

1362
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:42,292
Thank you.

1363
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:58,042
You done good, like
you Were meant for it.

1364
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,708
Yeah, he seemed at peace,
so I'm guessing

1365
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:07,375
it Will go quickly noW, huh?

1366
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,208
What's the matter?

1367
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:16,875
That Was me in there.

1368
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:19,917
I Was looking at myself
40 years from noW

1369
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,417
if I stayed the old Ben.

1370
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:29,750
Dare I say he Works
in mysterious Ways.

1371
01:36:35,375 --> 01:36:37,167
Can you drop me home?

1372
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,042
Wendy's Waiting for me.

1373
01:36:39,083 --> 01:36:40,667
Let's go.

1374
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:55,417
Hello.

1375
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:58,333
But...

1376
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:03,292
But he...

1377
01:37:03,375 --> 01:37:06,000
...yes, I understand.

1378
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:10,125
All right, I understand.

1379
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:12,708
Thank you.

1380
01:37:13,833 --> 01:37:15,708
Heh!

1381
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:19,125
That Was the boss.

1382
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:22,875
It looks like
you're going back.

1383
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:26,000
Going back?

1384
01:37:26,042 --> 01:37:29,125
To your old life.

1385
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:35,167
What are you
talking about?

1386
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:40,167
You dragged me into this
life kicking and screaming

1387
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:45,208
and I do What I'm supposed
to do, total surrender

1388
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:48,333
and noW you're gonna
send me back?

1389
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:50,917
Not me, you knoW, him.

1390
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,083
Well, then get him
back on the phone.

1391
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:53,042
Let me talk to him.

1392
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,750
I can't do that,
Ben, I'm sorry.

1393
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:58,042
I really am.

1394
01:37:58,125 --> 01:37:59,750
Well, then, Why?

1395
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:01,708
Why am I here?

1396
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:03,958
Why shoW me all this
if I can't have it?

1397
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:06,417
Why did you have me meet
Kimberly and Megan

1398
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:10,042
if I can't keep them?

1399
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:15,833
Do you have any idea What it
felt like to hear Wendy

1400
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:17,875
pray for me, huh?

1401
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:22,000
I mean, more than any deal
that I've ever...

1402
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:26,375
All right, look, point is taken.

1403
01:38:26,458 --> 01:38:27,750
All right, I'm in.
I get it.

1404
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:30,042
I'll sign up for Whatever.

1405
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:33,833
It's not real, Ben.

1406
01:38:33,875 --> 01:38:36,333
It's not the life you chose.

1407
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:40,417
Maybe you'll go back to
your old life With a changed

1408
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:43,833
attitude and reneWed faith
and become a better man.

1409
01:38:47,375 --> 01:38:50,792
So What happens to the kids,
and the church?

1410
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:53,833
Well, the church
Will still be there.

1411
01:38:53,917 --> 01:38:57,167
It's alWays been there,
and nobody ever said

1412
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:59,875
you can't have kids.

1413
01:39:03,167 --> 01:39:06,125
I never got to tell her
that I love her.

1414
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:11,208
Yeah, I knoW.

1415
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:16,750
Okay, look.

1416
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:17,833
What if We get
to your truck.

1417
01:39:17,917 --> 01:39:19,250
We take it there as fast
as We can go, all right?

1418
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:21,167
At least give me a chance
to say good-bye.

1419
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:23,208
No, there's not enough time.

1420
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:24,875
Give me the keys.

1421
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:26,083
I'm sorry, Ben, I can't.

1422
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:26,875
Just give me the keys.

1423
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:28,208
Ben, look.

1424
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:31,375
Please, don't ansWer it.

1425
01:39:31,458 --> 01:39:33,208
Oh, you Want me
to stall him?

1426
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,375
I don't think you understand.

1427
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:36,333
Please don't.

1428
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:39,875
All right, please,
don't ansWer it.

1429
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:41,875
Please don't ansWer it!

1430
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,708
Oh!

1431
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:52,333
<i>Don't pick it up.
Don't pick it up.</i>

1432
01:39:52,417 --> 01:39:54,000
Please don't pick it up!

1433
01:39:54,042 --> 01:39:56,917
You're aWake, finally.

1434
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,167
What happened, Where am I?

1435
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:02,917
You are in the hospital.

1436
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,875
<i>You were driving your new car,
which you didn't even</i>

1437
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:09,833
<i>tell me about, and you got
in some sort of accident.</i>

1438
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:13,042
The doctor said the air bag
bleW at just the right angle

1439
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:15,792
and knocked you unconscious.

1440
01:40:16,792 --> 01:40:20,042
You mean I've been here
the Whole time?

1441
01:40:20,125 --> 01:40:21,875
Poor baby.

1442
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:23,292
Don't Worry, I'll change
the reservations

1443
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:26,292
for Paris to next Weekend.

1444
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:32,208
I don't Want to go to Paris.

1445
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:36,208
<i>What is that
supposed to mean?</i>

1446
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:43,250
While I Was gone,
I mean While I Was asleep,

1447
01:40:43,333 --> 01:40:46,750
the strangest thing happened.

1448
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:49,875
- I Was married.
- Huh.

1449
01:40:49,958 --> 01:40:53,958
To my ex-girlfriend.

1450
01:40:54,042 --> 01:40:56,000
We had kids
and I Was a...

1451
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:57,958
Benny bear,
it doesn't bother me

1452
01:40:58,042 --> 01:41:01,167
that you Were dreaming
about your ex.

1453
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:02,208
Let's just...

1454
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:05,750
It Wasn't just a dream.

1455
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:08,167
I mean it lasted
a couple Weeks.

1456
01:41:08,208 --> 01:41:10,750
It Was so real.

1457
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:13,292
It Was a hit
on the head.

1458
01:41:13,375 --> 01:41:17,292
You've been out for
a couple of hours.

1459
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,708
Even if that's true,
I can't marry you.

1460
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I've decided to make some
changes in my life,

1461
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:33,208
and I knoW you Well enough
to knoW that you Wouldn't Want

1462
01:41:33,292 --> 01:41:35,833
to be part of them.

1463
01:41:35,875 --> 01:41:38,917
This isn't funny, Ben.

1464
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,708
It's not meant to be.

1465
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,375
Well, my attorney says
that an engagement ring

1466
01:41:49,417 --> 01:41:53,208
is implied conditional
under state laW

1467
01:41:53,292 --> 01:41:57,250
and that means that if you
break the engagement,

1468
01:41:57,333 --> 01:41:59,208
I get to keep the ring.

1469
01:41:59,292 --> 01:42:01,250
Yeah, your laWyer's right.
You can keep it.

1470
01:42:01,333 --> 01:42:05,417
I don't Want it anyWay.

1471
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:08,667
You don't?

1472
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:11,708
No.

1473
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:16,792
Ben Walker, you are making
the biggest mistake

1474
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:20,292
of your life.

1475
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:25,292
No, I did that
a long time ago.

1476
01:42:40,708 --> 01:42:43,417
Oh, it's never easy.

1477
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:49,125
Why, Why are you
doing this to me?

1478
01:42:53,833 --> 01:42:56,750
It's Thursday night.

1479
01:42:56,833 --> 01:42:58,208
She's here.
She's at the church tonight.

1480
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:59,750
She's here!

1481
01:42:59,833 --> 01:43:01,333
You really should stay
another night, Mr. Walker.

1482
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:03,250
Yeah, I knoW.
I'm okay.

1483
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:05,875
Sign there, please.

1484
01:43:07,042 --> 01:43:09,042
And sign here.

1485
01:43:09,083 --> 01:43:10,167
You hit your head very hard.

1486
01:43:10,208 --> 01:43:11,375
I knoW I did,
but I'm telling ya,

1487
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:14,250
it feels just fine right noW.

1488
01:43:14,333 --> 01:43:16,833
Here are your
personal effects.

1489
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:20,208
Thank you.

1490
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:24,667
That's a nice Watch.

1491
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:27,292
You like this Watch?

1492
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:28,750
It's a Panerai?

1493
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:29,917
You Want it?

1494
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,875
What?

1495
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:33,208
What kind of car you drive?

1496
01:43:57,792 --> 01:44:02,417
You sounded desperate
When you called,

1497
01:44:02,708 --> 01:44:09,000
and the Words are still
ringing in my head.

1498
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:14,083
We stood there silent
on the phone,

1499
01:44:14,167 --> 01:44:23,167
and no one spoke until I said
I'm still With you,

1500
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:32,167
but I knoW I can save you,
save you tonight.

1501
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:35,083
Hey.

1502
01:44:35,167 --> 01:44:36,667
Can I help you, sir?

1503
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:38,250
Charlie, it's me, it's Ben.

1504
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:40,083
I'm sorry, do I knoW you?

1505
01:44:40,167 --> 01:44:44,167
Well, of course,
What are you talking...

1506
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:46,125
You don't knoW
Who I am, do you?

1507
01:44:46,208 --> 01:44:48,167
<i>We have haven't met,
have we?</i>

1508
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,833
No, no, I guess not.

1509
01:44:49,875 --> 01:44:51,917
I'm sorry,
is Wendy Biederman here?

1510
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,125
She Was supposed to speak
here tonight, I think.

1511
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:56,167
Oh, that ended
about an hour ago.

1512
01:44:56,208 --> 01:44:58,750
<i>I'm just cleaning up.</i>

1513
01:44:58,833 --> 01:45:00,333
Okay, do you knoW
Where she Went?

1514
01:45:00,417 --> 01:45:01,708
I'm an old friend.

1515
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:05,833
She Wanted to say hi,
but I... I got sidetracked.

1516
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:07,417
<i>She headed back
to Chicago tonight.</i>

1517
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:09,167
Yeah, one of our members
just dropped her off

1518
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:11,708
at the bus station.

1519
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:16,833
Bus station.
Of course.

1520
01:45:16,875 --> 01:45:18,000
Thanks.

1521
01:45:18,042 --> 01:45:19,167
Sure.

1522
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:24,417
Oh, hey, this should take
care of your termite problem.

1523
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:29,292
Thanks again.

1524
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:32,333
HoW'd you knoW We had
a termite problem?

1525
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:42,375
I'm still With you,
but I knoW I can save you,

1526
01:45:42,458 --> 01:45:54,792
save you tonight, until
it breaks your heart.

1527
01:45:55,958 --> 01:46:04,375
NoW I can save you,
until it breaks your heart.

1528
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:19,667
Wendy.

1529
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:22,417
Ben?

1530
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:26,167
Ben Walker?

1531
01:46:26,208 --> 01:46:28,042
What are you doing here?

1532
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:29,917
Oh my gosh.

1533
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,417
I got your note today
so I got to the church,

1534
01:46:35,708 --> 01:46:39,167
but you had already left
so they told me you Were here.

1535
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:43,042
Yeah, yeah, my bus leaves
in a couple minutes.

1536
01:46:43,083 --> 01:46:46,667
Shoot, I Would have loved
to have caught up.

1537
01:46:46,708 --> 01:46:48,875
Couple minutes, huh?

1538
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:53,875
Yeah, I'm going
back to Chicago.

1539
01:46:56,958 --> 01:47:00,833
I can't believe you're
standing here.

1540
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,750
When Was the last time We...

1541
01:47:04,833 --> 01:47:07,083
Fifteen and a half years.

1542
01:47:08,708 --> 01:47:09,875
WoW.

1543
01:47:09,958 --> 01:47:14,833
I guess you're right,
that's, good memory.

1544
01:47:18,208 --> 01:47:22,167
So do you have an e-mail address
or cell phone?

1545
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:24,667
I can contact you When
I get back to Chicago.

1546

01:47:30,083 --> 01:47:33,417
Oh, that's a nice card.

1548
01:47:35,042 --> 01:47:39,375
So, you don't have time
to catch up, huh?

1549
01:47:40,375 --> 01:47:43,083
Well, it's so last minute
and my bus is leaving, so...

1550
01:47:43,167 --> 01:47:46,708
Yeah, yeah, I understand
it's no problem.

1551
01:47:46,792 --> 01:47:50,042
This is kind of Weird, I knoW.

1552
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:52,417
<i>Final boarding call for
Green Line 227 with service</i>

1553
01:47:52,708 --> 01:47:58,667
<i>to Chicago, Green Line 227

1558
01:48:16,458 --> 01:48:18,083
All right.

1559
01:48:18,167 --> 01:48:19,958
Bye.

1560
01:48:22,042 --> 01:48:25,667
Wendy, please don't go yet.

1561
01:48:33,292 --> 01:48:36,708
Ben, What are you doing?

1562
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:43,167
<i>What are you doing here,
of all places?</i>

1563
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:49,792
I made a huge mistake.
I Was Wrong to leave.

1564
01:48:49,875 --> 01:48:53,292
I Was Wrong to end
things With you.

1565
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,875
Ben, don't do this.

1566
01:48:54,958 --> 01:48:58,167
I have to.

1567
01:48:58,208 --> 01:49:06,417
Something's happened to me
in the last...

1568
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:11,333
something's changed me.

1569
01:49:11,375 --> 01:49:15,167
And I've seen What
a big mistake I've made

1570
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:19,292
in letting you go.

1571
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:25,958
I turned my back on What God
Wanted for me, for us,

1572
01:49:26,042 --> 01:49:29,417
and I have missed out
on so much.

1573
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:34,875
Ben, you can't do this.
I'm leaving.

1574
01:49:34,958 --> 01:49:37,292
I'm leaving right noW.
I have to go.

1575
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:41,083
Why did you
send me that note?

1576
01:49:41,167 --> 01:49:45,167
Because I Wanted
to say hi.

1577
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:50,875
Do you think about me?

1578
01:49:50,958 --> 01:49:58,375
What might have been, the life
We could have built together?

1579
01:49:58,417 --> 01:50:01,208
<i>The family what
we could have had?</i>

1580
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:04,792
Please, don't do this.
I have to go.

1581
01:50:04,875 --> 01:50:08,375
Just tell me.

1582
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,375
Have you thought about us?

1583
01:50:29,208 --> 01:50:35,042
Ben, you broke my heart, and
it's taken me so many years...

1584
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:44,083
to get over the hurt and the
anger that I've had for you,

1585
01:50:44,167 --> 01:50:47,167
<i>and the anger I had for God.</i>

1586
01:50:49,792 --> 01:50:55,417
I'm fine noW.
I Was fine.

1587
01:51:03,875 --> 01:51:06,667
Of course, I've thought about
What should have been.

1588
01:51:06,708 --> 01:51:12,000
Then don't leave.
Don't do What I did.

1589
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,000
It Was 15 years ago.

1590
01:51:16,083 --> 01:51:17,292
We don't knoW each other.

1591
01:51:17,375 --> 01:51:23,167
<i>Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.</i>

1592
01:51:24,958 --> 01:51:28,292
NoW can We take our time?

1593
01:51:28,375 --> 01:51:30,917
I'm going into
the seminary and...

1594
01:51:33,833 --> 01:51:36,417
...I Want us...

1595
01:51:36,708 --> 01:51:40,167
I Want to try it
again With you.

1596
01:51:40,208 --> 01:51:41,875
We can give it a chance,
can't We?

1597
01:51:41,958 --> 01:51:45,000
No, no, no.
It's too late.

1598
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,417
<i>Final call.</i>

1599
01:51:50,708 --> 01:51:52,417
I have to go.

1600
01:51:55,708 --> 01:51:58,750
I have to go.
I cannot do this.

1601
01:52:00,292 --> 01:52:02,208
Wendy, please.

1602
01:52:10,708 --> 01:52:13,333
Don't go.

1603
01:54:29,875 --> 01:54:31,292
Save a feW pieces
for yourself.

1604
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:34,292
You're eating for tWo noW.

1605
01:54:36,083 --> 01:54:38,792
<i>Close up on the belly.</i>

1606
01:54:40,417 --> 01:54:42,750
Kimberly, happy birthday.

1607
01:54:42,833 --> 01:54:46,000
Happy birthday, Kimberly.

1608
01:55:27,167 --> 01:55:31,042
One, tWo, three.

1609
01:56:03,875 --> 01:56:10,958
I Was gone for Way too long.

1610
01:56:11,042 --> 01:56:18,750
But you came in
and took me home.

1611
01:56:18,833 --> 01:56:25,958
I Was lost, couldn't
find the strength.

1612
01:56:26,042 --> 01:56:34,292
But you turned a stone,
carried me home.

1613
01:56:34,375 --> 01:56:38,417
NoW the sky's
so much bluer,

1614
01:56:38,708 --> 01:56:41,875
the river's less like mud.

1615
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:45,792
And the Way I feel
about myself

1616
01:56:45,875 --> 01:56:50,875
is a Whole lot more
like love.

1617
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:57,875
'Cause I Was gone
for Way too long,

1618
01:56:57,958 --> 01:57:05,708
But you held my hand
and led me home.

1619
01:57:32,167 --> 01:57:37,750
I'm finally home.
