I understand that you saw
something the other night.

874

Yeah. What'd you see?

875
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:45,090
Well, I'd gone to get a bottle
of Scotch for the dead man.

876
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:49,161
Um... This was before,
you know, he died.

In any case, that's the reason

1096
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:42,795
Woolf was so keen to shut
the theater the other night.

As it is, what with the play
being such a phenomenal success,

More like 73-74%, I'd say.

1107
00:53:14,696 --> 00:53:18,531
He killed Kopernick in the
theater to force it to close down

1108
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:20,432
so that he could make his film.

1109
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:22,500
He could marry his mistress.

1110
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:24,402
And then he could get
shot of a blackmailer.

1111

It's too elaborate.

Burn the place down, if
that's what you want.

1113
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:31,610
Besides, doesn't he need
a director to make a film?

1114
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:33,278
Well, then it's back
to Cocker-Norris.

because of creative differences.

1121
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:49,729
They do it out of revenge

1122

or rage because they've
lost a loved one.

1123
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:52,631
They can't forgive or forget,

1124
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,300
so they just stew and
fester alone in the dark
