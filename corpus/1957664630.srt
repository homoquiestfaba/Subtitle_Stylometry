They set me up, threatened me,
forced me to testify.

7
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,194
I had no choice.

8
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,364
Could we talk this out, huh?
On the ground?

9
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,865
We're not here
to talk, Sugar.

11
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,413
God. Come on, man.
She's clean.

12
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,248
She doesn't rate this shit.

13
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,833
You know what else she doesn't rate?

14
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,878
Her boyfriend in witness protection
who comes back for a quick taste.

15
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,631
That's on you.

16

both groaning

41
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,292

Damn, bro. Thank you.

Shut up.

46
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,654
You blew your cover.

47
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,615
You risked her life and the lives
of my deputies assigned to protect you.

48
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,826
I know, bro. I'm so, so sorry.

49
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,911
Baby, I'm so, so sorry.

50
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,162
Fuck you!

51
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,413
Go to hell!

52
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,748
So now you're special.

53
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,916
Special?

54
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,335
- Oh, my Jesus! No, bro, please.
- No.

55
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,754
I'll do anything you say,
straight up, bro. I promise.

56
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,755
I'm not your bro.

57
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,258
Wait. Just tell me what
you want me to do.

58
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,051
Sir, I'll do anything.

59
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,303
I want you to die.

laughing

63
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,699
Thank you. Thank you.

64
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,909
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

65
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,954
You've just been erased.

00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,873

67
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,896

exhales loudly

69
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,743
What the fuck is that?

70
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,997
You're supposed to look
like my hot young wife,

71
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,707
not some middle-aged banker.

72
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,542
Yes, Kosta.

73
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,211
Our biggest potential investors
are going to be here.

74
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,298
We need their money
to make ours look legit.

75
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,718
So if they talk to you, smile.

76
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,929
If they make a joke, laugh.

77
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,058
And if one of them flirts with you,

78
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,227
you bring him in here,

79
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,065
you bend over the sink
and you make him see the stars.

80
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,401
Understand?

81
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,281
kisses

82
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,454
Stay calm, Mrs. Kimura.

83
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,997
We're right here with you, Rina.

84
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,506
No, you're not.

85
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,219
exhales

86
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,016
groaning

87
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,059
Hey.

88
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,062
Who you burying tonight, bruh, huh?

89
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,274
Ugh, I tend to my flock,
you tend to yours.

90
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,567
Isn't that what you taught me?

91
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,777
Did I, Mace?

92
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,904
- I can't remember.
- gloves banging

93
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,406
Re-educate a brother.

94
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,909
You're a good cop.

95
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,910
grunts

96
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,578
Maybe one of the best we have.

97
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,205
Maybe.

98
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,374
Had a good commander.

99
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,209
both grunting

100
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,544
No, you had a great Commander.

101
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,547
Enjoy the ride while it lasts.

102
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,173
Program's on the chopping block.

103
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,884
Don't mess with me.

104
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,469
punching

105
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,929
Open your eyes, now.

106
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,850
We're the bad guys. Unfundable.

107
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,478
Thugs who move in the shadows,
guzzling tax dollars,

108
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,398
protecting people
who aren't exactly model citizens.

109
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,191
It's our duty to protect those people.

110
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,736
We're dinosaurs staring
into the eyes of a comet.

111
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,113
Pretty soon, we have to erase ourselves.

112
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,158
Say the word, old man.
I can make that happen.

113
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,369
grunting and groaning

114
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,747
Easy. I'm just the messenger, baby.

115
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,457
Huh?

116
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,667
instrumental music playing

117
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,753
- Kosta.
- Marco.

118
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,134
Check it out.

119
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,220
So big, so green.

120
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,848
They love that.

121
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,767
The council are very excited.

122
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,811
- You spoke to them?
- I did.

123
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,979
footsteps approaching

124
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,992
About time.

125
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,660
Get to work.

126
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,290
You look beautiful.

127
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,710
I was told I had to be.

128
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,295
It's a big event.

129
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,256
But you look so calm, Marco.

130
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,093
- whispering I'm a good faker.
- Mmm.

131
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,055
Well, we both are.

132
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,559
What?

133
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,771
Come, princess.

134
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,238
Rina, this is Mr. Winks.

135
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,031
He's a great new friend of ours.

136
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,243
You have superb taste, Kosta.

137
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,039
She'll babysit you
while I do my song and dance.

138
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,499
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

139
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,209
indistinct chattering

140
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,130
Kosta May I have
your attention, please?

141
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,924
Welcome, friends.

142
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,218
Kosta You beautiful people,
gather around...

143
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,053
whispering Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

144
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,723
Kosta ...and bear witness
to something amazing.

145
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,853
This project represents the future.

146
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,022
Kosta The one we've been
working towards for years.

147
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,483
- Our future.
- crowd Our future.

148
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,241
Just grabbing something for Mr. Kimura.

150
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,631
Dowd Okay, get a move on.

151
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,550
You don't have much time.

152
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,596
- door opens
- digital beeping

153
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,890

00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,398
beeping

155
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,442
Good. Quickly now.

156
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,069
Got it. I'm moving
as fast as I... oh, shit.

157
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,113
Rina Ugh!
The necklace just fell.

158
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,699
The camera. We can't see anything.

159
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,367
Rina I dropped it.
Hold on, I'm looking for it.

160
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,203
I can't seem to find it.

161
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,829
Forget it. There's no time.

162
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,208
- Rina Moving as fast as I can, guys.
- unlocking

163
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,668
Moving as fast as I can.

164

165
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,049
Dunn What was that?

166
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,467
Mrs. Kimura?

167
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,594
Dowd Mrs. Kimura?

168
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,640
Are you okay?
What's happening?

169
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,477
It's done. Go. Finish up and get out.

170
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,519
I got it.

171
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,731
Yep. Leaving right now.

172
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,608
Where's my wife?

173
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,735
jingling

174
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,530
door opens

175
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,618
You left that whale alone.

176
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,078
I got nervous.

177
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,955
Yeah, what are you doing in here?

178
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,831
Hmm?

179
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,167
My safe!

180
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,336
gun cocking

181
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,214
I'm leaving you, Kosta.

182
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,424
The FBI has all your files
on your drive.

183
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,801
You are going to prison.

184
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,469
No, don't engage him.

185
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,470
I'm going free.

186
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,680
Dowd Go to the front now!

187
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,806
We'll pick you up. Let's go!

188
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,725
Rina gasps

189
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,935
FBI?

190
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,979
Don't you get it?

191
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,898
My people own their people.

192
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:58,987
Now you, on the other hand,
you have nothing. Nobody.

193
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,073
And you're not going anywhere.

194
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,912
clicks

195
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,498
You bitch.

196
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,333
- Kosta grunts
- crashes

197
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,086
- Kosta Huh?
- Rina groaning

198
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,379
Now, you listen to me you little...

199
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,588
both grunt

200
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,634
- Kosta crashes
- people screaming

201
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,732
Marco, he was drunk. He fell.

202
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,276
Marco Nobody leaves.

203
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,695
Wait. Where are you going?

204
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,697
Rina I just need some air.

205
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,576
gasps

206
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,494
I'll take care of this,
but you can't go anywhere.

207
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,871
distant tires screeching

208
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,083
You're always so kind, Marco.

209
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,794
Forgive me.

210
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,840
FBI.

211
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,383
- Put down the gun!
- Marco Rina.

212
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,344
- Get in, Mrs. Kimura. Move.
- Marco Get back here!

213
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,553
Dowd Go!

214
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,056
Rina!

215
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,602
- We made a deal
- Before she killed Kosta Kimura.

216
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,312
And starred in that shit show.

217
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,024
We need a guarantee that your client
will show up and testify at trial.

218
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,442
Otherwise, no deal.

219
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,278
Mrs. Kimura delivered
everything you asked for.

220
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,363
You need to wrap this up.

221
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,656
Give her the passport you promised
and send us on our way.

222
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,867
I want you to meet Deputy Pollard.

223
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,036
Hell no. Pollard?

224
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,039
She's not going
into any witness program.

225
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,208
Mrs. Kimura,

226
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,461
I'm here to offer you federal protection
at a safe location until the trial.

227
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,296
You're playing us.

228
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,258
sighs
This is why nobody trusts you people.

229
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,470
You don't need to trust us, ma'am.
You just need to stay alive.

230
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,597
And live like some kind of prisoner.

231
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,640
That's up to you.

232
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,601
- You people are all the same.
- Yeah.

233
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,395
We're done here.

234
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,023
Mrs. Kimura.

235
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,778
I know you're afraid.

236
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,572
But you like walking, right?

237
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,908
- Is he for real?
- scoffing Yeah.

238
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,744
Are you threatening me?

239
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,539
You don't take our offer
and I can tell you from experience,

240
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,708
what you take for granted now,
will become an exercise in running,

241
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,918
hiding.

242
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,003
Wondering what's
around every corner

243
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,631
until what's around the corner
kills you.

244
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,258
But you can save me, right?

245
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,343
I can help you stay alive.

246
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,845
And make it to trial?

247
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,056
That's all you
really care about, isn't it?

248
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,684
- Mrs. Kimura...
- I have plans, Deputy.

249
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,895
And they don't include another man
who knows what's best for me.

250
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,690
Nice to have met you, Mrs. Kimura.

251
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,943
Great to see you too, Vanessa.

252
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,157
- eerie music playing
- rain pattering

253
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,202
I've shamed the organization.
I know what must be done.

254
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,430
She played us both, Kosta.

255
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,478
Now we play her.

256
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,404
Ugh.

257
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,419
Gap.

258
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,505
Royal.

259
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,298
Express.

260
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,967
Venue.

261
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,931
breath trembling Hello.

262
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,352
Vanessa?

263
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,939
It's necessary for now.

264
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,404
You've been waiting
for this day, Rina.

265
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,407
Don't let some Fed bully
spoil it for you.

266
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,079
To freedom?

267
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,375
- To freedom.
- glasses clinking

268
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,376
bag thuds

269
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,919
Pollard.

270
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,712
Inside.

271
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,131
- They're coming.
- Miss Kimura, do as he says. Go.

272
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,050
Mason U.S. Marshal.
Inform your team.

273
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,011
Marshals are here.
We're coming in.

274
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,763
Coming in, kill the lights.

275
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,516
- Go.
- Positions, now!

276
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,893
Lock the gate. Let's move it!

277
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,355
- Lock the door behind you. Stay down.
- door locks

278
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,400
explosion

279
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,319
He's here!

280
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,613
Damn it!

281
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,701
bomb hissing

282
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,702
man 4 Smoke bomb!

283
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,623
guns firing

284
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,464
guns firing

285
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,012
alarm blaring

286
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,771
No. No!

287
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,983
grunting

288
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,865
- Vanessa gasps
- gun fires

289
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,783
- Vanessa screaming
- glass crashing

290
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,996
crying

291
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,082
suspenseful music playing

292
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:52,882
whimpering

293
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,261
both grunting

294
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,433
The cold wallet, Rina. Where is it?

295
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,020
Marco?

296
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,737
grunting

297
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,705
glass crashing

298
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,586
intense music playing

299
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,588
Rina screaming

300
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,301
Rina screaming

301
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,512
Remember this.

302
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,557
You!

303
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,353
I need your clothes.
Everything you have on you.

304
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,396
What? Why?

305
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,940
They'll be back. Change, now.

306
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,405
I need you to move faster, ma'am.

307
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,282
Give me your dress, now.

308
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,660
I need you to hurry up.

309
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,121
The guys inside weren't on their own.
Come on.

310
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,288
Quicker.

311
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,542
Sixty seconds. Come on, faster.

312
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,088
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- I'm going!

313
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,424
siren approaching

314
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,843
- I don't know what you're doing.
- Shoes.

315
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,099
Fuck this!

316
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,476
Hey, where you gonna go?

317
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,771
Let me go!

318
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,942
Stop.

319
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:37,695
Don't move.

320
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,199
grunting

321
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,161
- screaming Pollard, behind you!
- gunshots

322
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,714
body crashes

323
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,759
car alarms blaring

324
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,350
Congratulations,
you've just been erased.

325
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,069
That poor woman, her body...

326
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,448
Did you...

327
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,159
dig her up or...

328
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,828
What?

329
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,080
She'll match your height,
your weight,

330
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,208
your DNA, your prints,
your dental records.

331
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,334
I took care of it.

332
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,128
Her face was disfigured
from the sulfuric acid they used

333
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,464
- to assault and torture you.
- Is this some kind of joke?

334
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,966
- I almost died.
- You did die.

335
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,511
That's the point.

336
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,222
That's what the world
is going to think until you testify.

337
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,682
It's not very efficient,
but it was your choice.

338
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:53,854
That was our deal.

339
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,610
"Rachel?"

340
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,073
I'm not a Rachel.
I told you, no witness protection.

341
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,034
Okay.

342
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,203
Lean forward.

343
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,668
Rina grunts

344
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,505
Go, stay...

345
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,757
Whatever. We don't give you
another chance.

346
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,051
- We?
- My bosses.

347
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,679
The American people,
the people who need your help.

348
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,558
I've just been erased
by Captain Fucking America.

349
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,017
Listen,

350
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,272
you testify, and I swear
I'll do my best to keep you safe,

351
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,399
- but we do it...
- My way or the highway?

352
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,651
Got it.

353
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,782
I need a minute... please.

354
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:50,870
One minute.

355
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,664
door opens

356
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,417
door slams

357
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,217
sighs

358
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,058
metal clangs

359
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,022
door opens

360
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,319
- door closes
- Mrs. Kimura...

361
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,571
Rachel.

362
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,408
Call me Rachel.

363
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,547
Rina Where are you taking me?

364
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,259
Mason A place
for special cases like yours.

365
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,096
So far out of bounds,
you can breathe.

366
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,528
thrilling music playing

367
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,493
Paradise or prison, it's your choice.

368
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,873
- keys jingling
- Welcome to Cape Town.

369
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,420
Mason Go ahead.

370
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,050
Make yourself at home.

371
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,469
door locks

372
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,847
Go and stand by the green.

373
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,182
objects clatter

374
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,350
Turn around slowly.

375
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,687
Why?

376
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,732
We use your own biometrics
to fool recognition software.

377
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,192
It's like a digital poison pill.

378
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,738
Any camera anywhere in the world
recognizes your face,

379
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,033
our backdoor bot scrambles it.

380
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,076
Bye, Big Brother.

381
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,120
Who made this?

382
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,872
Big Brother.

383
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,541
Mason There's cash in there. Rands.

384
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,586
Enough to go shopping. Get you started.

385
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,379
You're also going
to get an allowance from us.

386
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,008
You're my warden and my daddy.

387
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,886
Take a selfie.

388
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,057
camera shutter clicks

389
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,141
- computer trilling
- typing

390
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,439
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

391
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,816
This is too weird.

392
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,526
I mean, it's me, but...

393
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,488
it's not me.

394
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,657
Stay off Rina Kimura's social media.

395
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,036
No texting, no contacting anyone
from your old life.

396
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,412
Don't even check it.

397
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,414
Ever.

398
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,334
Rina Kimura is dead.

399
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,756
Rina Kimura is dead.

400
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,511
female anchor Let's take you
to Action News 6 reporter Sean...

401
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,679
Rina Kimura is no longer a concern.

402
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,726
The cold wallet is missing.
It will be recovered.

403
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,148
Who helped her?

404
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,779
Where is it?

405
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,584
dog barks distantly

406
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,634
phone vibrating

407
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,429
Rina Morning.

408
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,223
Feed the prisoner.

409
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:27,104
Plus, it's as far away as we can get you
from the Syndicate in L.A.

410
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,981
Quite the eater, Pollard.

411
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,025
How often do you get back here?

412
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,738
Well, the Cape Malay cuisine
can't be beat.

413
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,074
More hot sauce?

414
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,868
Rachel?

415
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,913
Try the bobotie, it's good.

416
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,584
I really wish you'd let me
keep that passport.

417
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,337
It'd mean a lot to me.

418
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,433
When this is all over,
what are you going to do?

419
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,268
Rina sighs

420
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,354
Actually,

421
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,190
I do have a plan.

422
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,359
It's goofy, you'll laugh.

423
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:19,031
Well, you won't, but most humans might.

424
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,372
Financial planning.

425
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,835
You know, in my opinion,
key to having true freedom in life...

426
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,588
is financial planning.

427
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,635
Making sure you're never
in debt to anyone.

428
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,347
I'm gonna go to school.

429
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,141
I am gonna get a degree in finance.

430
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,603
And I'm gonna help people...

431
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,065
like me.

432
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,949
Hey.

433
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,785
Relax, just going to the bathroom...

434
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,370
Dad.

435
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,472
Everything okay?

436
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,557
Yeah, just...

437
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,309
waiting.

438
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,002
sighs

439
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,218
phone vibrating

440
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:04,970
exhales loudly

441
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,930
Marshal Rhodes.

442
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,765
There's been a breach.

443
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,518
Are any of my witnesses compromised?

444
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,771
Unclear. There's a team
headed your way now.

445
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,398
Marshal Rhodes You know the drill.

446
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,650
Understood.

447
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,578
Mace.

448
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,204
Welcome to Cape Town.

449
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,374
Paradise or prison.
Isn't that your schtick, bruh?

450
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,835
- Oltcheck.
- Mason.

451
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,128
You believe this shit?

452
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,213
Since we started this program,
never been anything

453
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,132
but happily ever after... until now.

454
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,510
NSA swept up some chatter yesterday.

455
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,221
Encrypted calls between
the Syndicate Council.

456
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,640
They know your witness
isn't dead, Mason.

457
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,352
I covered every base.

458
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,104
Every move. This is your car.

459
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,149
If it makes you feel any better,
mine may have exposure, too.

460
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,443
Is she okay?

461
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:06,114
I think so. I mean, even Marshal Rhodes
doesn't know where I stashed her.

462
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,783
I heard she's a handful.

463
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,535
Maybe she broke cover,
dropped a clue. Who knows?

464
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,245
You trust her?

465
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,122
You taught me better than that, Paul.

466
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,666
Our orders are to move everyone
in the program.

467
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,502
Re-erase them.

468
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,129
I need time to figure this out.

469
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,672
Your witness, your call.

470
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,425
Mine, I'm extracting out.

471
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,595
We could use a shooter
and looter like you, Mason.

472
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,764
Unless you're going straight
for your witness.

473
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,058
I got your backs.

474
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,060
It's good to see you, bro.

475
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,937
Now, this gonna be live.

476
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,997
intense music playing

477
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,881
car doors closing

478
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,383
- Felicia, how are you, gorgeous?
- Hey, Paul.

479
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,678
- Mason, welcome back.
- Thanks.

480
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,597
Deputy Oltcheck, meet Felicia.

481
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,932
Galloway. Strategic Surveillance Unit.

482
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,477
Our local badge in case things get hot.

483
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,937
She's got great assets.

484
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,148
- Don't be a pig, Whitlock.
- All right.

485
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,358
We're plucking out
one of your witnesses, huh?

486
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,194
I can't tell you who she is
or what she did,

487
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,321
but I'd give my left nut to protect her.

488
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,655
Let's roll.

489
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,743
Interesting choice, Paul.

490
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,329
Planting your witness in this shithole.

491
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,999
This shithole is directly tied
to the history of apartheid.

492
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,461
scoffing A fancy word for what happens
when people get scared.

493
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,797
Scared enough to mobilize
whole governments and laws

494
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,050
to push black
and brown people out of cities.

495
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,219
Deprive them of access to the best jobs,

496
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,263
electricity and running water
and worse...

497
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,015
pit them against each other.

498
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,434
Yeah, so why don't they just go?

499
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,645
Or buy the land, like everyone else?

500
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,398
The game's rigged. Why buy into a system
that's intent on destroying you?

501
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,360
The rules are set up for you to fail,
you do what?

502
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,071
Change the rules of engagement,
my brother.

503
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,822
You got me shouting in this bitch.

504
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,951
Must've been a trip, Mason,
serving with this legend.

505
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,494
More like an honor.

506
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,873
So you dropped your witness here
because you knew no one would find her?

507
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,583
cell phone ringing

508
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:04,834
Paul?

509
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,670
She's not answering.

510
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,592
- Nobody comes or goes.
- Galloway Got it.

511
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,139
dog barking

512
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,184
thrilling music playing

513
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,783
That's not cupcakes.

514
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,326
Never said she was a saint.

515
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,412
Dagga grow.

516
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,582
- Marijuana.
- Oltcheck, take the back.

517
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,129
How many doors have we been through
just like this, Mason?

518
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,755
Too many.

519
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,551
Patricia. Police, open up.

520
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,186
metal clanging

521
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,540
- Clear.
- Left clear.

522
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,384
door creaks open

523
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,039
Boyfriend.

524
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,550
plastic shuffling

525
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,234
- gunshot
- body thuds

526
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,070
exhales

527
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,353
- Mason Psst!
- groans

528
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,533
grunting

529
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,130
Patricia whimpering

530
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,340
- You're early.
- You're late.

531
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,594
Patricia whimpers

532
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,186
breathing heavily

533
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,230
He can't hurt you.

534
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,400
He can't hurt you anymore.

535
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:00,779
It's okay.

536
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,240
- I got you.
- gunshot

537
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,376
both grunting

538
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,378
gunshot

539
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,891
breath trembling

540
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,269
She's been hit.
She needs an ambulance. Go, Felicia.

541
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,271
Go.

542
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,314
Patricia breathing raggedly

543
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,485
both grunting

544
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,992
Mason Paul.

545
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,426
We lost her.

546
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,015
Why send five men to kill her?

547
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,892
Her or us?

548
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,439
Whitlock They weren't dealers, Mace.

549
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,108
These men were pros.

550
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,777
It was a setup, a trap.

551
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,697
Oltcheck Hey, Pollard.

552
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,324
Isn't she one of yours?

553
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,123
Call Rina Kimura, Pollard, now.

554
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,211
I have to live-contact her.
That's our arrangement.

555
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,505
Where is she?

556
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,341
Downtown.

557
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,468
Okay. Let's go grab her.

558
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:07,864
What you doing?

559
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,117
Just informing Marshal Rhodes
we're extracting my witness.

560
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,621
phone vibrating

561
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:15,914
metal clangs

562
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,081
Okay.

563
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,836
27 Gratz Road.

564
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,256
That's good work back there.

565
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,926
You okay?

566
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,178
Yeah, you?

567
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,139
I'm tripping.

568
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,810
Something I've to talk to you about.

569
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:40,438
It's important.

570
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,607
Come on.

571
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,276
Yeah.

572
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,706
You forgot the one most important thing
I taught you, Mace.

573
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,416
Never lie to me.

574
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,004
You just texted your witness
Rina Kimura 911 to bug out.

575
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,800
I didn't forget.

576
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,552
Why, Paul?

577
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,306
scoffs Let's see.

578
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,393
The public gave up
on guys like us, Mace.

579
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,560
So I gave up on them.

580
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,150
laughing You say it enough,
it starts to sound like the truth.

581
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,903
It's the money, isn't it?

582
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,614
Now you may not want
to admit it, Mace.

583
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,784
But there is a game here.

584
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,454
- You make a play or you get played.
- Mason grunts

585
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:53,136
A common man
with uncommon desire to succeed.

586
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,391
Now you sit your save-a-hoe
fixated ass court-side,

587
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,309
and you watch me play.

588
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,647
He was on to us. Go ahead.

589
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,569
Aww!

590
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,614
Don't look so heartbroken, sweetheart.
I'll make it better.

591
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,034
You burned down the whole program
just to flush out one witness?

592
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,996
That bitch stole something
on her way out of her gilded cage.

593
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,875
Something the Syndicate will pay
a shit ton of money to get back.

594
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,502
After, of course, we bury her for real.

595
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,839
And the only way Rina Kimura gets back
into the U.S. is in a body bag.

596
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,132
You son of a bitch.

597
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,925
You told the Syndicate
she's still alive.

598
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,970
Come on. She was never going to testify.

599
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,014
You must have had a hunch.

600
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,892
Why protect someone who's using you?

601
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,310
Huh?

602
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:44,896
Ah!

603
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,065
You like her.

604
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,610
- laughing He caught feelings.
- Shut the f...

605
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,820
No, you shut the fuck up, Mace.

606
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,324
You see,

607
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,744
that scares you.
You don't know what to do with that.

608
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,580
There's something I can never teach you.

609
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,916
- What's that?
- Not to care so damn much.

610
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,460
About the job, your witnesses.

611
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,213
When you erase someone,
you start a relationship.

612
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,633
laughing And you're okay
as long as you get to play God.

613
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,176
In control.

614
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:19,138
But making a real relationship work,
an equal one...

615
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:23,184
You see, that never was
your jam, was it, Mace?

616
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,520
You ever had one?

617
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:29,107
- Other than with me, and your abs?
- Mason grunts

618
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,691
coughs

619
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,277
Tell me where she is.

620
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,321
We part ways...

621
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,158
and you can go back to playing a hero
for escorts and criminals.

622
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,619
Too late, Paul.

623
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,579
You crossed the line.

624
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,040
Mason grunts

625
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,504
There is no line anymore.

626
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,297
I erased it!

627
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,050
Now you tell me where the fuck she is.

628
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,970
He deleted the 911 he sent to Kimura.

629
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,764
- I set a trap and trace.
- Atta boy, Mikey.

630
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,933
You know what?

631
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,645
I think I'm going
to call him "Mason 2.0."

632
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,649
- Location?
- NSA is locked on her cell,

633
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,526
tracking it for us in real-time.

634
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,487
Inform our contact.

635
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,120
How much are they paying you?

636
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,081
Take note, Oltcheck.

637
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,377
He's just trying to distract us
as he figures out a way to escape.

638
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,712
Noted.

639
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,005
Finder's fee.

640
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,633
One for the girl, one for the wallet.
Get them both.

641
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,760
Beats babysitting scum for peanuts.

642
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,389
You wouldn't be telling me this
unless you planned on killing me.

643
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,600
Ding! Ding! That is the plan.

644
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,395
But only once I get the girl,
and I'm sure I'm getting paid.

645
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,521
Paul...

646
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,608
you made a deal with the Syndicate.

647
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,276
Make one with me.

648
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,444
laughs

649
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,738
Come on, you can do better than that.

650
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,908
What can you offer me, hmm?

651
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,535
Your life.

652
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,704
This guy...

653
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,706
Oltcheck,

654
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:12,460
I'll make things right with the locals.
Smooth the situation.

655
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,046
You take this one to our vehicle,

656
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,131
if you think you can handle that.

657
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,299
Copy.

658
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,051
- Move.
- Paul.

659
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,302
Move.

660
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,946
thrilling music playing

661
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,217
Rina!

662
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,970
grunts

663
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,273
upbeat music playing

664
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,137
panting

665
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,283
breathing heavily

666
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,914
I need to know exactly
what happened here, Paul.

667
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,250
What are you talking about?
The evidence is on the floor.

668
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,628
Your plan to flush out my witness,

669
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,881
pretty risky, Oltcheck.

670
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:22,882
Shut up.

671
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,176
What's your cut?

672
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,553
Can't think Paul's
gonna let you live to see it.

673
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,680
He chose me for a reason, Pollard.

674
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,475
- You really are stupid, aren't you?
- I said shut the fuck up!

675
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,437
You know, you're right about Paul.
He is a legend.

676
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,273
The first thing he taught me,
improvisation...

677
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,816
Is the art of field work.

678
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:42,818
rumbling

679
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,779
- gunshots
- people screaming

680
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,742
Sounds like some bullshit.

681
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,577
I better go.

682
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,703
You do that.

683
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,414
dog barking

684
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,215
suspenseful music playing

685
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,565
crashing

686
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:33,994
door opens

687
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,414
gasping

688
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,211
gunshots

689
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,799
Move! Move! Move!

690
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,468
gunshots

691
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,190
Don't fucking move!

692
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:04,984
gunshot

693
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,736
both grunting

694
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,116
Think you're Whitlock, huh?

695
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,870
You sure about that, Deputy?

696
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,581
- gunshot
- groans

697
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,875
No.

698
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,960
- gunshot
- groans

699
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,763
metal clangs

700
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,475
Good luck, Deputy.

701
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,103
door creaks open

702
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,494
racy music playing

703
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,914
- Rina groans
- steam hissing

704
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,473
Come on, bro.

705
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:19,517
Paul, he, uh...

706
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,520
I'm sorry.

707
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,691
- On the edge of the world here, Mikey...
- gun cocks

708
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,109
you Screw up...

709
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,611
you fall off.

710
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:34,782
Oltcheck whispering Please.

711
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,284
- Please, Paul.
- gunshot

712
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,621
breathing heavily

713
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,958
door opens

714
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,885
Marco screaming Rina!

715
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,100
Give me the cold wallet
and I'll spare your life.

716
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,565
screaming For fuck's sake! Rina!

717
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,569
engine roaring

718
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,118
- tires screeching
- Stop the car.

719
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,703
Easy, easy. Don't shoot, ese!

720
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,745
Marco Where is she?

721
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,707
Rina?

722
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,729
Come here, little mouse.

723
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,318
She tricked me.

724
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,445
I lost her.

725
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,323
My guy hit us
with a mean crossover, too.

726
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,034
The fuck?

727
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,453
speaking Japanese
Kon'nichiwal

728
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,624
in English Your men, poachers...

729
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,168
trust them?

730
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,420
Business associates. We go way back.

731
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,174
Had side deals down here for years.

732
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,550
They need investors.

733
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,261
The council will be interested.

734
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,846
It's an easy way to do your laundry.

735
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,765
Marco One thing at a time, Whitlock.

736
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,019
My price just went up.

737
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,230
I want the wallet, too.
Payment for the girl.

738
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,733
- That wasn't our deal.
- I'm changing it.

739
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,654
This is getting complicated,
expensive. Stupid.

740
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,909
I need to talk to my people.

741
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,327
You do that.

742
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,831
How do we find them?

743
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,793
Pollard blocked Rina Kimura's face,
her biometrics and his own

744
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:54,463
from the CCTV network
that covers this entire city,

745
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,507
like steam on shit.

746
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,510
But...

747
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,095
You unblocked them,
so they could be tracked.

748
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,223
- Yes, sir.
- They don't realize it?

749
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,519
Pollard will fetch Kimura,
who'll be in a safe house.

750
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,689
After that... in Japanese sayonara.

751
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,273
in English
Did I say I was fucking Japanese?

752
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,025
Do I look like I give a fuck?

753
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,157
Whitlock Do we have a deal?

754
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,993
You bet.

755
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:27,162
Let's go.

756
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,236
- door closes
- lighter flicks

757
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,196
exhales

758
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:07,911
footsteps approaching

759
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,466
Rina breathing heavily

760
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:24,553
unlocks door

761
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,099
- opens door
- gasps

762
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,821
- metal clang
- door closes

763
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,120
- screaming and panting Oh, my God!
- ostrich booms

764
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,040
Shoo!

765
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,001
Shoo! whimpers

766
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,049
bird growls

767
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,219
Okay. Yeah. This way. This way.

768
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,472
Not this way. Not this way!

769
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,350
whimpering

770
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:12,976
Back off!

771
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,609
- Go! Get out of here!
- Mason Hey. Easy, easy, easy. Hey.

772
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,820
How you doing?
You being a pain?

773
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:27,115
Come on. This way. Come on.
Come on. Good girl. Good.

774
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,117
- Rina No.
- Come on. Away from her.

775
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,329
Come on. Come on. This way.

776
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,039
Come on. Come on.

777
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,089
So you met Janice, huh?
She's just scared.

778
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:45,050
"She's scared." She's scared?

779
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,762
What happened?

780
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,931
I ran into an old friend.

781
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,935
Me too. Mine nearly killed me.

782
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,274
This is your place?

783
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,985
It's an old tourist farm.

784
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,655
I bought it, and let the animals go.

785
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,657
Some of them stayed.

786
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,330
Hey.

787
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,584
I got it, okay?

788
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,252
Hold on.

789
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:29,553
Nail.

790
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,770
Thank you.

791
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,858
slow music playing

792
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,990
unlocks and creaks open

793
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,997
Why are we here?
I mean, what went wrong?

794
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,668
Deputy Whitlock.

795
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,631
Paul.

796
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,092
He was my closest friend.

797
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:12,763
A mentor.

798
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,182
He turned.

799
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,311
He's here in Cape Town
to kill you for the Syndicate.

800
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,189
He sold out.

801
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,651
And I never saw it coming.

802
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,362
That's how Marco found me.

803
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:29,905
Marco?

804
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,575
An enforcer for the Syndicate.

805
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,744
My old friend.

806
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,830
He tried to kill me
right after you sent the 911.

807
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,418
Whitlock gave Marco
your cell phone location and tracked it,

808
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,963
with the help of Uncle Sam,

809
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:48,840
and me.

810
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,930
Our old friends are new friends.

811
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,231
Agent Galloway has updates.

812
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:05,524
Go.

813
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,276
We caught a break off the CCTV network.

814
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:11,113
A man on foot
matching Pollard's description.

815
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,073
We're Sat tracking him now

816
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,575
and I've issued a warrant
for his arrest.

817
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,494
En route now, Marshal Rhodes.

818
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,746
With some local backup.

819
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,666
The Mason Pollard I know
would never do this.

820
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,251
Something we missed?

821
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,170
Program means everything to him.

822
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,256
That's all he's got.

823
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:33,093
Something very serious
must have happened.

824
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,221
He keeps it all inside.

825
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,975
- Bring him in alive.
- Understood.

826
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,227
Good work, Galloway.

827
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:43,770
Good luck.

828
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:46,732
Game time.

829
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,428
humming

830
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,354
Who's Bud?

831
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,568
Someone who never got
the second chance you're getting now.

832
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,487
I deserve more than that.

833
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,114
Do you?

834
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,790
The cold wallet you stole, where is it?

835
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,125
The what?

836
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,920
You were never gonna testify, were you?

837
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,840
You just needed a passport
so you could escape.

838
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:58,303
Cash out, take off,
no matter who got hurt or killed.

839
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,055
Okay, I never used the wallet.

840
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,099
I knew they'd trace it if I tried.

841
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,267
Where is it?

842
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,271
Back at Rachel's house. I hid it.

843
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,451
Okay. I'm sorry.

844
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,745
I've had to lie my whole life.
It's hard for me to stop.

845
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:24,913
Save it.

846
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:30,293
I've heard about these,
for cryptocurrency.

847
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,505
Unhackable, offline...

848
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,506
Cold.

849
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,592
Kosta used it for bribes.

850
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,010
Polycarbonate.

851
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,847
Looks like metal. This is how
you got it through airport security?

852
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,183
How much is on this thing?

853
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:49,229
I don't know yet. I swear.
I haven't had a chance to check.

854
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:55,944
Seedcode.

855
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:59,156
It's 24 words Kosta chose.
Impossible to hack.

856
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,200
Cold wallet's like a locked mailbox.

857
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,327
Cash can't go in or out without a key.

858
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,454
And you deleted the seedcode.

859
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,249
I thought it'd be an insurance policy.

860
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,752
- Keep them from killing me.
- Till after they torture you, Rina.

861
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,464
How could someone access this money?

862
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:19,634
I need a secure network, very secure.

863
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,637
The 24 words, where are they now?

864
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,516
Jesus.

865
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,144
The seedcode, the words,
write them down, now.

866
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,729
I need that money to start over.

867
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,439
Then try earning it, Rina.

868
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,859
Really? Get fucking real.

869
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,028
It is all about the money.

870
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,072
Kosta, Marco, Paul Whitlock.

871
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,450
You wanna be like those people?

872
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,370
Everybody is like them.

873
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:52,000
Okay, this world is one big lying,
corrupt nightmare.

874
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,294
- Not the whole world.
- Most people.

875
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,631
And most of you.

876
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,092
Nobody hates a bad cop
more than a good cop.

877
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:02,677
Nobody.

878
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,930
But you don't see that, do you?

879
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,141
You just lump us all in together,
say you want to get rid of us

880
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,517
when all we really want

881
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:13,313
is to take down the bad guys
and to keep you safe.

882
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,776
I don't want to get rid of you, okay?

883
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,445
I just want you to treat me
like a human being.

884
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,038
digital beeping

885
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,046
I never meant for anyone
to get hurt, Pollard.

886
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,548
And I won't lie to you again.

887
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,717
I promise.

888
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:48,932
You know how to use this?

889
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,560
- Yeah.
- Raise your hand.

890
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,649
Do you swear to protect and defend
the United States Constitution

891
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,776
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic?

892
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,195
I do.

893
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,031
Good. Put your hand down.

894
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,537
Because our old friends got here
61 seconds ago.

895
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,249
Move your ass, Deputy.

896
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,589
guns cocking

897
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,437
- engine revs
- guns firing

898
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,355
Ah-ah-ah.

899
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,027
It's a distraction. We're wasting ammo.

900
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:50,827
Easy now.

901
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,125
Talon, you take left!

902
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:58,626
Kudo, you take right.

903
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,129
He'll have an egress.

904
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,673
Where are you, Mace?

905
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,134
Can't be far.

906
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:14,059
distant rumbling

907
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,394
Ah, there you are. Predictable.

908
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:17,896
Grenade launcher.

909
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,149
grenade shot

910
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,276
explosion

911
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,697
- grenade shot
- Rina screams

912
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:29,991
Leggo.

913
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:32,285
Mason Come on.

914
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,371
intense music playing

915
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,181
Move. Move!

916
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,069
gunfire

917
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:12,867
explosion

918
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,161
Mason You okay?

919
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,756
Move! Move! Move!

920
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,281
whispering Where are you?

921
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:54,993
Whitlock Keep your eyes open now.

922
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,453
Rina Pollard.

923
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,497
Pollard. What are you doing?

924
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,583
I'm just looking for a friend.

925
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:04,669
Shit!

926
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,713
Good boy.

927
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:08,715
Atta boy.

928
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,133
growls

929
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,343
Hey, no! Alfie, no!

930
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,513
Don't give me that shit.

931
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,270
Strode, to my right.

932
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,026
As fast as you can, okay?

933
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:44,209
I see them. I got them. On my lead.

934
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:52,759
- They're mine.
- Mine.

935
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,678
- man screams
- grenade shot

936
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:00,725
Fuck, man!

937
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,102
Shit!

938
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,731
- engine accelerating
- gun firing

939
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,704
Move out. Move!

940
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,448
upbeat music playing

941
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,545
The Sugar Shack opens in an hour.

942
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,297
Smileys aren't ready yet.

943
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:18,219
Sugar Shack. You couldn't have
come up with a better name, Sugar?

944
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,724
I see it, but I don't believe it.

945
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,394
Pollard, I swear I never broke cover.

946
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,396
Bru, this is the guy.

947
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,066
Man! You're the one who send
us this doos.

948
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,735
Doos?

949
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,154
That means, like, fool, jackass.

950
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:37,947
- Okay, hey...
- You pick. Come on.

951
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,992
Look, if you're asking for me
to take him back, I'm sorry.

952
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,160
All sales are final.

953
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:44,412
Nah, it's lekker.

954
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,580
We'll keep him.

955
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,664
"Lekker?"

956
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,041
It means "good."

957
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:49,792
sighs

958
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,002
Wait.

959
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:52,879
She's with you?

960
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,048
You look so surprised.

961
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,092
Well, this one don't cross the line.

962
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:02,555
Do pleasure. So you must be business.

963
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,224
Mason She just joined the club, Sugar.

964
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,226
She needs your help.

965
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:09,896
I need your help.

966
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,443
You sprung me out of a coffin,
gave me everything,

967
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,571
my own legit business
in the middle of paradise.

968
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:21,282
Whatever you need, bro,
we're here for you.

969
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,451
speaking foreign language

970
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,535
We got you.

971
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,245
That means don't worry.

972
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:28,790
Lekker.

973
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,626
An! I like her. laughs

974
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,008
Why are you changing your mind?
Letting me go for the money?

975
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,053
If I can't protect you
from my own people,

976
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:45,264
you deserve to get what you can
when you can.

977
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,850
You surprise me, Pollard.

978
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,310
I surprise myself.

979
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:53,564
Need your game face, Deputy.
Don't get overexcited.

980
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:57,318
Paul, you were right.

981
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,780
They showed up
at a financial institution.

982
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:02,865
Good girl.

983
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,079
whistling

984
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:23,886
Can I help you people?

985
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,557
Yeah, you can keep this area clear
while my associate lays down some cloth.

986
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,808
I mean, what are you doing here?

987
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,561
You know, just some touch up work.

988
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,980
Somebody called it in. Hold on.

989
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,815
I have a name for you
right over here with me.

990
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,152
Can you sort it out?

991
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,028
Just...

992
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,741
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.

993
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,828
So Mister and Miss...

994
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:49,954
Bobotie.

995
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,832
Robyn and Ernie Bobotie.

996
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,585
And what brings you in today?

997
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,004
We need a loan, as fast as you can.

998
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,047
I'm expecting.

999
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,633
Expecting?

1000
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,302
A child, umm...

1001
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:06,012
Baby.

1002
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,347
Yes.

1003
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,310
Congrats. Exciting.

1004
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,686
What are today's rates?

1005
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:18,274
Yes, well, we can offer you

1006
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,318
some of the most competitive rates
in the market.

1007
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,319
phone ringing

1008
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,571
female voice Mr. Chetty, can you
come to the lobby floor?

1009
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:24,697
We need you.

1010
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,326
Could you excuse me a minute?

1011
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,161
Of course.

1012
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,418
Ernie?

1013
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,380
Mason Nice.

1014
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:45,718
Just a little misunderstanding.
This is your name on the request, yeah?

1015
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,221
No. No, this is a mistake.

1016
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,890
Okay? You need to take all of this stuff
out of here at once, okay?

1017
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,350
I have customers.

1018
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:53,976
Customers upstairs who are waiting.

1019
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,436
He has customers.

1020
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,979
Okay.

1021
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,278
Sorry.

1022
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,115
- You gosh damn imbecile!
- Excuse.

1023
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,951
- Clean it up right now before it sets.
- Yeah.

1024
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,370
I am so sorry for the floor, sir.

1025
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:13,412
Got you.

1026
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,498
Don't move, bro. You're making it worse.

1027
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:16,999
Quickly now.

1028
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,298
Gap.

1029
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,511
He just logged in. Where are you?

1030
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,096
Very close.

1031
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,473
- car honks
- engine accelerating

1032
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,226
Vault. South.

1033
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,314
Wow. That's more than I ever...

1034
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:41,440
Impressive.

1035
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:45,152
Like I said, financial planning.

1036
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,405
- You'll be fine. Sorry.
- Jesus.

1037
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:51,868
Chetty There's more on...
Just my shoes. My shoes. Take it.

1038
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,161
- So let me just...
- I can smell it. I can smell it.

1039
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,580
- gags
- This is really bad.

1040
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:56,622
Just...

1041
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,380
Funds not available.

1042
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,715
Whitlock.

1043
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,509
They were waiting for this.

1044
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,141
I see you, Mace.

1045
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,434
Watch out, big foot. Wet paint.

1046
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,394
- Hey, don't fuck with me.
- Okay, listen up.

1047
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,564
Looking for these two.

1048
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,569
Are you joking?

1049
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:29,071
Couldn't hack the wallet,
so they got into my DAX Fiat account.

1050
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:30,740
Where did the money go?

1051
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,784
Ocean Trace International?

1052
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:35,703
Whitlock's on a task force.

1053
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,455
He's been investigating
Ocean Trace for years.

1054
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:41,918
It's a shipping company here with ties
to the black market, endangered animals.

1055
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,127
They're poachers, Rina.

1056
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,714
I just paid Ocean Trace $30 million.

1057
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:49,258
Little man,

1058
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,719
where are they?

1059
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,639
In my office, up the stairs to the left.

1060
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,682
Galloway, cover this exit.

1061
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,184
You, there.

1062
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,146
All of you, don't move.

1063
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,404
Atta boy, Sugar. Come on, we gotta go.

1064
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:12,823
I said don't move.

1065
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,873
Marco, come up from the garage.

1066
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,006
Don't move.

1067
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,054
gunshots

1068
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,267
gun firing

1069
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,491
Come on, Miss Kimura.

1070
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:58,119
Mason clearly can't keep you safe.

1071
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,037
You're gonna keep playing with junior?

1072
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:01,998
Or you wanna take a bet on big papa?

1073
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,715
Mace, listen to me.

1074
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:12,341
Give her up.

1075
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,302
It's the only way
she walks out of here alive.

1076
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:18,806
gun firing

1077
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,892
Whitlock laughs

1078
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,896
Whitlock Miss Kimura,

1079
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,859
Mason ever tell you
the sad story about Bud?

1080
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,239
Did he try to win you over
with it, Ms. Kimura?

1081
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,199
Try to get some of that git gud?

1082
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,285
gun firing

1083
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:43,664
Rina Mason.

1084
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,209
I can make it.

1085
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,545
Over there, the fire escape.

1086
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,339
- gun cocking
- both panting

1087
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,010
- You go.
- Then you go.

1088
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:57,511
Go.

1089
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,143
Watch out, bro.

1090
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:05,811
screams

1091
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:06,854
Rina!

1092
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,487
Gun, now.

1093
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,501
What the hell is going on here, Paul?

1094
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:32,671
Thanks for your help, honey.

1095
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,143
Mace?

1096
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:47,645
Rina panting

1097
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,648
intense music playing

1098
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,451
- gunshot
- glass breaking

1099
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,038
Rina screams

1100
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,044
- car screeching
- Mason grunts

1101
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,008
Rina Watch out!

1102
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,138
gunshots

1103
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,062
Yo, Pollard, get in, bro.

1104
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,826
When I said this could go sideways,
Mason, I never thought it'd be you.

1105
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,287
They say you killed Oltcheck,
with his own weapon.

1106
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,913
Whitlock's gone rogue.

1107
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,707
He killed his own witness
to get to mine.

1108
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:53,294
Was Rina Kimura
in possession of stolen evidence?

1109
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,087
- Yes, but...
- I've got the FBI with me.

1110
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,755
We'll take Kimura in ourselves.

1111
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:58,215
I can't let you do that.

1112
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,593
I need your badge, Pollard.

1113
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,513
mid-tempo techno music playing

1114
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,892
Who wants an Umqgombothi?

1115
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:21,113
Ocean Trace has a ship in port
leaving tonight. Usual cargo.

1116
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,325
If I ever come face to face
with those poachers,

1117
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,452
I will rock up and donner the dwankies.

1118
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,037
- Yebo.
- Ja.

1119
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:38,255
in English
Okay. So, what do we do?

1120
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:41,550
Pollard.

1121
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:44,929
music distorts, stops

1122
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:46,096
Shit, bro.

1123
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:48,724
If you don't like the music,
just turn that shit off.

1124
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:55,981
Anything I do...

1125
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,567
Whitlock will be waiting.

1126
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,694
And then he'll kill her.

1127
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,991
in Afrikaans
'N boer maak 'n plan.

1128
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:07,534
in English
What?

1129
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,372
The first thing this country
and its great people taught me.

1130
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,582
After you dropped me here,

1131
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,085
I was lost, ready to give up.

1132
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,921
in Afrikaans
'N boer maak 'n plan.

1133
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,714
in English
"A farmer makes a plan."

1134
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,842
In other words, figure it out.

1135
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:27,596
- I'm no farmer.
- And you have no plan.

1136
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,681
So make one.

1137
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,683
Or you're gonna sit
on your sad little ass

1138
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,476
crying like a goddamn toddler?

1139
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,688
Why the fuck did I save you?

1140
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,190
I don't know, bro. You love me?

1141
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,156
animals chittering

1142
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,008
Rina.

1143
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,552
Rina panting

1144
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,727
Marco, let me go.

1145
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,732
I mean, we can start over somewhere.

1146
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,233
Yeah?

1147
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,446
Where you're going,

1148
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:27,906
you'll fetch a good price.

1149
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,161
You two have that in common.

1150
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,414
Don't do this.

1151
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,834
If you truly care for me,

1152
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:40,878
let me go.

1153
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,088
Yeah.

1154
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,758
And someday, we can be together.

1155
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,384
You and I.

1156
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,473
Not in this lifetime.

1157
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:03,901
Fuck you.

1158
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,656
rhino groaning

1159
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,719
motor whirring

1160
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,483
Mason Marshal Rhodes, it's me.

1161
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:46,944
Just listen.

1162
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,113
I have evidence against Whitlock.

1163
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,740
Dock 45, Cape Town Port Annex.

1164
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:55,828
You want me, boss?

1165
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,414
Come get me.

1166
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,332
Marshal Rhodes
Pollard, you're in deep shit.

1167
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,503
Last chance to back out, bros.

1168
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:05,629
No way, bruh.

1169
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:08,757
You brought me to paradise,
I ain't letting it get stepped on.

1170
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,218
Yeah. Fuck that shit.

1171
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:12,594
Yebo.

1172
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:17,850
Hey, listen up.

1173
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:20,978
Keep your heads on a swivel
and your assholes puckered.

1174
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:23,480
Son of a bitch is out there.

1175
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,242
There's a new investment.

1176
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:36,702
Yeah.

1177
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,912
The council has awarded you
too generously.

1178
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,956
That was our deal.

1179
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,875
I deliver the girl,
I get the cold wallet.

1180
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,626
And I do whatever the fuck
I want with it.

1181
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,505
See, I'm turning your 30 million
into my 60.

1182
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,467
Maybe more, depending how much I get
for that preggo black rhino.

1183
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,721
Spinning shit into gold,
it's the American way.

1184
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,473
both laugh

1185
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,434
Getting to it.

1186
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:04,188
Sweet thing. Ayo.

1187
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,532
What's up, boys? Who ordered the dinner?

1188
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:16,825
Restricted area, buddy.

1189
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:17,951
Just wait there.

1190
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:18,911
Hold on.

1191
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,954
We got an order of smileys
off the braai.

1192
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,749
They are very nutritious, my friend.

1193
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,210
- You're going to love it.
- Who's the idiot that got take out?

1194
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:27,377
chatter continues indistinctly
on radio

1195
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,506
Hey.

1196
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,466
Check those two junkers.

1197
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:38,138
Take a smell. Smell it.
You want to smell this. It's so good.

1198
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,224
- Stand back.
- Hey!

1199
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,147
He's here.

1200
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,107
both grunting

1201
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:51,360
gunshot

1202
01:23:58,909 --> 01:23:59,868
Take the head.

1203
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,301
laughs Oh...

1204
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,053
laughs

1205
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:21,807
gunshots

1206
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:25,561
Go.

1207
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,313
gunfire

1208
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:36,238
Get that goddamn rhino on this boat now!

1209
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:46,206
rhino groaning

1210
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:53,714
Find Rina.

1211
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:57,259
Check the containers first
and then the ship. Go now.

1212
01:24:58,677 --> 01:24:59,720
Yebo.

1213
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,106
gunshot

1214
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:32,961
both grunting

1215
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,547
animals chittering

1216
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:56,818
Go on, princess, call for him.

1217
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,072
Get his attention, get him to come.

1218
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:05,243
Put your hands up.

1219
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:12,542
- gunshots
- groaning

1220
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,184
Don't fucking move.

1221
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,020
gun cocking

1222
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,023
Shit!

1223
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:36,274
gun firing

1224
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,152
rhino groaning

rhino groaning

1227
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,920
Do you really think some random cop's
gonna save you, huh?

1228
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,509
Fucking bitch.

1229
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:58,899
Rina and Marco grunting

1230
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,027
- Rina!
- No!

1231
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,198
Mace!

1232
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,451
- Put the shooter down.
- Rina whimpering

1233
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,328
Do it.

1234
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,250
both struggling

1235
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:20,170
- gunshot
- Marco grunts

1236
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:22,881
Whitlock chuckles

1237
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:23,840
Rina.

1238
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,509
Rina is dead!

1239
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:29,971
Congratulations, Jack,

1240
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,140
you've just been erased.

1241
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,145
Put the gun down.

1242
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,105
Do it, now!

1243
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:42,818
Move.

1244
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:52,035
Thank you, sweetheart.
Couldn't have done it without you.

1245
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,247
You can't out wolf
the original wolf, Mace.

1246
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,873
- gunshot
- groans

1247
01:28:58,667 --> 01:28:59,960
Take us up!

1248
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:19,688
explosion

1249
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,369
clattering

1250
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,464
gun firing

1251
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:48,258
groans

1252
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:10,405
Come on, baby.

1253
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,089
You thought it was gonna be that easy?

1254
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:30,675
I trained you better than that.

1255
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:46,650
Rina screams

1256
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:51,821
I got you.

1257
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,580
Sugar, you have a shot.

1258
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:01,665
Shit!

1259
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:02,832
I'm out.

1260
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,460
You're wrong about this place, Mace.

1261
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,672
It's not paradise or prison,

1262
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:10,882
it's heaven or hell.

1263
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:13,218
- Welcome to hell.
- Hey!

1264
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,260
rhino groans

1265
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:19,724
Go.

1266
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,560
- Hold on.
- What?

1267
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:26,731
Bye-bye, buddy.

1268
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:28,566
Bye.

1269
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:36,366
Shit!

1270
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:46,876
rhino runs away

1271
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:52,424
groaning Mace.

1272
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,978
You can't leave me like this.

1273
01:32:07,564 --> 01:32:08,690
Mace.

1274
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:22,245
Together. One, two...

1275
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,376
Mason, look out!

1276
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,345
You got me feeling and shit.

1277
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:45,602
Goodbye, my friend.

1278
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,648
Congratulations, Paul.

1279
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,236
You've just been erased.

1280
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,491
- Damn!
- Whitlock groans

1281
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,418
indistinct radio chatter

1282
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,345
Where's Whitlock?

1283
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:22,430
Went for a ride.

1284
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:24,140
Good job, Pollard.

1285
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:25,225
Not bad.

1286
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:29,854
Nice of you to join us.

1287
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:37,529
Couldn't have done this
without you doos.

1288
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,114
Thank you.

1289
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:40,240
speaking foreign language

1290
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:41,282
in English We got you.

1291
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:43,785
Mother city, motherfuckers.

1292
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:44,911
Yebo.

1293
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:47,038
Welcome to the club, girl.

1294
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:48,414
Rina Thanks, Sugar.

1295
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,583
Beers at the Sugar Shack?
What do you guys say?

1296
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:52,544
- Mason No, let's go somewhere nice.
- Rina Yebo.

1297
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,462
Mason Let's go somewhere good.

1298
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:03,763
reporter Six months after the death
of Deputy Paul Whitlock,

1299
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:05,348
in Cape Town, South Africa,

1300
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:08,935
we're here at the Federal Courthouse
in downtown Los Angeles,

1301
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:12,480
where the witness' testimony
led to the conviction of several

1302
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:14,524
high-level members of the Syndicate.

1303
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:18,194
So, I guess this is goodbye.

1304
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:20,280
Guess so.

1305
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,742
There's a little change on here.

1306
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:32,750
It's a lot of change.

1307
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,879
Given your service,
we want you to have it.

1308
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:37,797
- Legit?
- Mmm-hmm.

1309
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:38,882
This is for real?

1310
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:40,717
So is this.

1311
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:49,642
Robyn.

1312
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:52,061
Nhi Nguyen.

1313
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:53,188
Did I spell it right?

1314
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:57,317
Thank you.

1315
01:34:58,193 --> 01:34:59,319
Check her resume.

1316
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:01,905
I hear she's gonna be
a financial planner.

1317
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:04,949
So where does she live?

1318
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:07,243
Anywhere she wants.

1319
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,543
Since we're never gonna
see each other again,

1320
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:17,921
who's Bud?

1321
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,217
Bud was my brother.

1322
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,138
Bud was a little girl called Emily
who lived down the street.

1323
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:31,809
Bud was Paul and I's
staff sergeant in Afghanistan.

1324
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:35,730
Anyone I tried to save and couldn't.

1325
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,651
I can erase people from this world,

1326
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:42,445
but I can't erase them
from my conscience.

1327
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,909
I'll sleep a lot better knowing
that Bud isn't you.

1328
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,704
Good luck, Robyn.

1329
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:53,623
You too.

1330
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,042
Jack.

1331
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,253
My name is Jack.

1332
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:21,567
door closes

1333
01:36:23,945 --> 01:36:25,363
explosion

1334
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,243
people screaming

1335
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:44,465
siren wailing

1336
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:25,089
upbeat music playing

1337
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,805
What are you doing?

1338
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,434
Crossing a line.

1339
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:55,536
Didn't see that coming. ©
