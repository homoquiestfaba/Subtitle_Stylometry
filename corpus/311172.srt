BALL

2
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:40,323
Hey, you got a safety pin?

3
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:42,325
Why would I have a safety pin?

4
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,831
Oh, good God.

5
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:54,838
This is easy as hell.
Ready? One, two, three.

6
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:57,340
It's gone, ladies. Where'd it go?

7
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,342
That was so cool.
- Yeah, I know.

8
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:01,344
Hey, listen. I'm having
a party this weekend.

9
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:03,346
Yeah?
- Yeah. You should come.

10
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,852
Hey, I need a pin. Somebody have a pin?

11
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:10,353
Please?

12
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:14,357
What am I supposed to do with this?

13
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:15,859
It's all I got.

14
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,862
People, people, people!

15
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:20,864
It's show time!

16
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,477
Relax, Ameet.
- It happens to the best of us.

17
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,479
It didn't happen to you, so shut up.

18
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,482
Oh, hey, Ameet, look.
I found a safety pin.

19
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:23,486
You want it?
- It's not that funny, big boy.

20
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,488
Don't count on me for tomorrow.

21
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,490
Bobby's big day, huh?

22
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:29,492
I think it's pathetic.

23
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:32,996
I'd lose my pants any day not
to have to go through that.

24
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:33,997
Ruby Chandra, huh?

25
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,498
Yeah, why?

26
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,001
Poor you.

27
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,503
What's that supposed to mean?

28
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,005
You never exactly met her, have you?

29
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:44,007
No. That's kind of the point.

30
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,512
What? What's wrong with her?

31
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:51,014
What's wrong with her?

32
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,517
She's fine, man. I don't know.

33
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,521
In a unique kind of way.

34
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,031
Go see what she looks like.

35
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:10,533
No.

36
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,036
Come on, Ameet, help a brother out.

37
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:15,038
No.

38
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,539
Please?

39
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,044
Okay.

40
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:28,051
Hi, Auntie.
- Hi, Ameet. How are you?

41
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,053
Hi, Uncle. How are you?

42
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:31,054
Hi.

43
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:33,556
This is Ruby's mother.

44
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,058
This is Saima.

45
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,561
Isn't she beautiful?

46
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,063
Well?

47
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:45,568
Bobby? It's time.

48
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,576
Hi.

49
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,580
Hi.

50
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:06,089
Whew.

51
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,591
Hey.

52
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,100
Oh, hell no!

53
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:25,108
No!

54
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:28,111
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,113
No.

56
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:34,617
Sorry.

57
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,623
Whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?

58
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,626
Did you see that thing?
She's a wildebeest!

59
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:50,133
Do you hear that shit? I can't
live with that the rest of my life.

60
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,135
You got to go back and apologize.
- What?

61
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:54,637
I'm not saying you should marry her,
but you can't leave her like this.

62
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,639
Watch me.

63
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,143
I'm sorry. I'll talk with him.

64
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,647
What the hell is going on?

65
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,649
I got this under control.
You can just turn around.

66
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,151
I don't think so.

67
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,153
That's my best friend down
there crying like a baby.

68
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,654
Wildebeest!
- Would you please leave?

69
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,156
Good idea.

70
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:18,161
I'm supposed to be Sleeping Beauty!

71
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:22,165
Hey, roll me out of here.
- No.

72
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:24,667
Please? Please?
- No. No.

73
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,169
Please?
- Shut up.

74
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:15,218
Can you believe it?
- No.

75
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,721
Cheers.

76
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,726
You idiot!

77
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:36,739
Saima, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--

78
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,242
Ameet, this is the ladies' room.

79
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:44,747
Is there anything I can do to help?

80
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,750
Yeah. Get out.

81
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,252
Are you sure there's nothing I can do?

82
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:50,753
Get out!

83
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,267
What's the matter with you?
- Mom.

84
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:07,770
It's just a spilled drink.
- Did Ameet do this?

85
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,772
It was an accident.

86
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:13,776
On behalf of my son,
please accept my apologies.

87
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:16,279
That's all right.
- That boy.

88
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,782
I don't know how he can survive
without a woman in his life.

89
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:32,295
What?

90
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,829
Okay, okay.

91
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:10,833
Yeah, hi. Okay, okay.

92
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:20,843
Momm!

93
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,874
Aah! Ow!

94
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,377
Hurts?
- Yes!

95
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,879
So we got married.

96
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,881
I didn't get a honey moon, of course.

97
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,383
I got a nurse.

98
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:01,384
Hi, honey.

99
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:02,885
Hi, honey!

100
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:04,887
Yeah, hi.
- Hold this.

101
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,891
Oh!

102
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,393
All right.

103
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,894
Oh.

104
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:15,898
Thank you.
- Poor baby.

105
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:31,414
Little chips for my honey.
You want some more of this?

106
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:32,915
Thank you.

107
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,419
My baby.

108
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:40,423
I can't believe Bobby
got trapped like that.

109
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:55,938
See ya.
- Where are you going?

110
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,940
Out.

111
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,942
Don't be late.

112
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,449
Where are you going?
- Out.

113
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,451
You should concentra te on your studies.

114
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,454
It's Friday night.

115
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:14,457
After so much hard
work. You are in medical.

116
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:17,960
Why you want to ruin that opportunity?

117
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,962
Papa, it's just one night.

118
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:22,465
Hey, you work now.

119
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:25,468
Tomorrow we are taking
dinner with some friends.

120
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:28,971
You also come. It'll be your layer time.

121
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,473
You enjoy then.

122
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,980
But, Papa, what about Dave?

123
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,983
Is he also taking dinner tomorrow?

124
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,039
God bless you, God.

125
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,571
Oh, God.

126
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:16,078
Damn!

127
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,582
Why are you always in heat?

128
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,584
Because I know what I want, girl.

129
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,092
Look at that ass.

130
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,631
Hey!
- Aah!

131
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,636
Hey, Saima.

132
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,141
What's with her?

133
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:43,666
What happened to you?

134
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,167
Hurricane Ameet.

135
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,669
Huh?

136
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,673
Where is everybody?

137
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,193
Hey.

138
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:12,194
No.

139
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:13,195
What's your problem?

140
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,197
You are.

141
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:17,700
Take it easy.

142
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,203
I would if you'd stay away from me.

143
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,206
Why can't you just leave me alone?

144
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:27,209
Can't you see, I can't stand you.

145
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,211
I don't want you around me,

146
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:33,215
and I'm sick of you
spilling shit all over me.

147
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:34,717
What?

148
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:42,725
Drink?

149
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,754
I found out where everyone went.

150
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,258
They left.

151
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,761
What?

152
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:23,265
I can't find them, and
their cars are gone.

153
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:27,269
Great. And how am I
supposed to get home?

154
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,630
You...

155
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,134
I...

156
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,639
Tomorrow you're coming with us.

157
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,142
You're going to take dinne
r at a friend's place.

158
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,144
You be ready.

159
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,158
Come on, Deep.

160
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,160
You gotta play better
D if you want to win.

161
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,163
Play defense with your
feet, not like Bobby.

162
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,664
I wish Bobby could play with us.

163
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,667
He will... soon.
- When?

164
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,169
Four to six months.

165
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,172
Why does he have to be married anyway?

166
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,175
I don't know. It was
just his time, I guess.

167
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:18,180
Does he love Ruby?
- It's complicated, Deep.

168
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,682
Love is just a part of it.
- What is love?

169
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,688
Well, um, love is...

170
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,193
Love is when two people
care for each other so much

171
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,695
that they'd be willing to
do anything for the other.

172
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,698
Is that how Bobby feel s about Ruby?

173
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,702
Well, not yet, but he will... soon.

174
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,704
When are you goi ng to get married?

175
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,719
Ohh! Oh, God!

176
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,721
Ameet, are you okay?

177
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,724
What happened?
- No!

178
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,230
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

179
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,734
What are you doing here?

180
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,736
I don't know.

181
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,739
I guess our parents hit
it off at the wedding.

182
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,245
So, Ameet...

183
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,248
I hear you are doing computer science.

184
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,751
Good profession.

185
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,254
Huh, Saima?

186
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:36,258
You know, Saima is doing medical.

187
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,759
I'm an intern.

188
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,761
Yes, yes, medical.

189
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,265
And...

190
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,277
Mom, I'm gonna go to my room.

191
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,778
Excuse me.

192
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:17,799
Saima, why don't you go
see if Ameet needs anything?

193
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,802
Mm-hmm.

194
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,305
Go, go.

195
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,818
She is quite something.

196
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,820
I told you so.

197
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,824
Come in.

198
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,331
What do you want?

199
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,334
Papa wanted to know
if you needed anything.

200
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:57,839
Is it me, or are your parents
acting kind of strange?

201
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,842
Yeah, actually they have
been acting kind of funny.

202
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,344
What's with them, huh?

203
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,348
I mean, I didn't know our
parents knew each other,

204
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,351
and then Papa sends me in
here to check on you and...

205
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,355
They'd never allow me to be
alone with a guy unless...

206
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,359
Oh, my God!

207
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,860
Ow.

208
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,362
Where are you going?

209
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,364
I'm leaving.

210
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,366
That didn't exactly work for Bobby,

211
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,870
and I don't think it's going to work
for you, not in your predicament.

212
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,379
Shit.

213
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,882
I'm not ready to get married.
- You? What about me?

214
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,885
I can't get married.
Not now and not to you.

215
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,886
Yeah!

216
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,391
Hey, what's wrong with marrying me?

217
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,396
Okay, wait.

218
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,399
There has got to be an
easy way out of this.

219
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,906
Our parents are reasonable people.

220
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,910
We'll just explain to them that
we're not ready to get married.

221
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,412
How old are you?

222
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:14,416
26. Why?

223
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,918
I'm 25. That's not going to work.

224
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,921
My father already
thinks I'm an old maid.

225
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,925
Well, we have to try something.

226
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,929
Okay. Okay.

227
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,431
Calm.

228
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,434
Reasonable.

229
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,935
Rational.

230
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,439
Calm.

231
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,941
Reasonable.

232
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,443
Rational.

233
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,947
This is an excellent match.

234
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,450
You are both getting good education.

235
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,953
Dad, we don't want to get married.

236
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,955
We're not ready.

237
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,957
I did not want to get married.

238
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,960
I was not ready.

239
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,462
Huh? -
Mm-hmm.

240
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,465
But it-- it all worked
out for the best.

241
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:04,966
But we don't love each other.

242
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,469
Forget about love. We
don't even like each other.

243
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,970
Why are you worrying about love?

244
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,474
I did not have any love
when I married your mother.

245
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,975
Ask her. Did I have?

246
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,977
No. But you will learn it.

247
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:20,982
You guys don't care about passion
or desire or any of that, do you?

248
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,984
You are thinking of romance, sho-mance.

249
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,988
You are seeing films and
all. It is not like that.

250
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,490
Hey.
- Hmm?

251
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,992
Please explain to them.
- Let me tell you.

252
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,995
It's very simple. You get married.

253
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,997
You will have your home.
- Correct.

254
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,499
You will be together.
- Correct.

255
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,501
Then you will have children and family

256
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,503
and love will come.

257
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,505
Don't worry, it'll come.
- Maybe 40 years.

258
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,007
It'll come automatically. Look at us.

259
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,009
It came after 27 years , but it came.

260
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,011
27, 45-- What is
the difference?

261
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,513
Yeah, I know, I know.

262
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,014
That's it.

263
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,016
You see?

264
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,024
So we're sitting in
his living room, right?

265
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,528
And his father is like bald
and I think he drinks too much

266
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,531
because he's got me
pinned in from this side

267
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,534
and my father comes
in-- - You're lying.

268
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,540
I can't do this.

269
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,543
Then let them know you won't.

270
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,545
I can't do that.

271
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,551
Run away. I've got some money saved up.

272
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,553
I can drop you o ff at the
bus stati on and you could--

273
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,559
I can't do that either. It...

274
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,061
It doesn't work that way.

275
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,063
How does it work, Saima?

276
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,069
They've always looked out for me,

277
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,572
and I know I'm going to get out of this,

278
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,575
but I just don't want to...

279
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,577
I don't want to upset them.

280
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,081
I just don't know how.

281
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,086
I don't understand.

282
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,093
It's not funny.

283
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,096
Hey, it happens to
the best of us, Ameet.

284
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,600
What do I do?

285
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,603
I am the last person you should ask.

286
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,607
Can I get you anything, Ameet?

287
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,109
Thank you, no.

288
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,614
By the way, congratulations.

289
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,117
Thanks.

290
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,624
So how are you guys getting along?

291
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,126
Well, it's really weird.

292
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,630
But she's nice.

293
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,632
You'll know soon enough.

294
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,646
Where are you going?

295
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,147
To the hospital.

296
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,650
Good, good. Go.

297
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,652
Saima.

298
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,656
I'm only wanting to give
you a secure future, beta.

299
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,161
Yeah, I know, Papa.

300
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,186
Oh, I'm sorry.

301
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,188
Hey, Josh. How you doing?

302
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,690
I'm doing great.
- Great to see you.

303
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,192
I need to talk to you about something.
- Okay.

304
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,194
I'll catch you a little
later. I'm in a rush.

305
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,196
Okay, I'll see ya.
- See ya.

306
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,197
What took you so long?

307
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,700
Hey, don't snap at me.
We're not married yet.

308
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,703
If that's what you think it all about,
then I definitely don't want to be with you.

309
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,206
What is that supposed to mean? It's not
like you have any idea what it's all about.

310
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,709
It's about love, cooperation!

311
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,210
Shh!

312
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,213
Working together to live a better life.

313
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:16,217
It's about raising kids and teaching
them what's right and what's wrong.

314
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,721
It's about trusting someon e
with your innermost secrets.

315
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:24,726
It's about passion and fire and
emotion that you can just run away with.

316
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,230
That's what I think a
marriage is all about.

317
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,240
Aah! Aah!

318
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,745
Oww! Oh, God!Oh!

319
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,247
Are you okay?
- Shh!

320
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,252
I'm fine.
- Shh. Shh.

321
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,754
I'm fine.
- Shh.

322
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,256
Owie!

323
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,760
Ow!

324
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,762
Feel any better?

325
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,764
I'm okay.

326
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,766
I'm, I'âm... Yeah.
- Huh?

327
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,269
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm... I'm peachy.

328
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,274
So, do you have a plan?

329
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,777
Huh?
- A plan.

330
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,782
Uh, yeah.

331
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,785
Of course I do.

332
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,789
A toast to the happy couple.

333
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,291
Let us celebrate this union.

334
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,794
Not only a union between two people,

335
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,796
but a union between two families.

336
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,298
Cheers!
- Cheers!

337
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:44,806
It is my greatest pleasure
to have Saima join our family.

338
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,808
Welcome.

339
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,814
I also would like to say a few words.

340
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,820
I just want to take this
opportunity to thank you all

341
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,824
for setting me up with
this wonderful woman.

342
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,326
She's smart...

343
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,830
witty...

344
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,332
and, oh, so hot.

345
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,353
What do you think you're doing?

346
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,355
What? You are my woman.

347
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,357
The hell I am!

348
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,376
How wonderful. A lovers' quarrel.

349
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,379
Lovers'  quarrel.

350
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,901
What? No.

351
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,903
It is not funny.

352
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,906
It is not funny.
- Yes, it is.

353
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,908
No.

354
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,912
I can't even have Bobby and the
rest of my friends over anymore.

355
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,914
And I can forget about a bachelor party.

356
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,916
It's over. Totally over.

357
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,417
Oh, no.

358
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:46,427
By the way, what was the
deal with that glass of wine?

359
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,930
Payback.

360
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,432
Fair enough.

361
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,434
At least I got a kiss first.

362
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,938
Oh, I'd say you got
a bit more than that.

363
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,941
You liked it.
- Nah.

364
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,442
Did you?

365
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,444
Dream on.

366
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,950
So what do we do now?

367
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,452
About the kiss?

368
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:15,456
No, about getting out of this, jerk.

369
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,958
I don't know.

370
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,463
Hey. What's up, yo?

371
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,465
Hey, sweetie.

372
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,473
You're looking better there, tough guy.

373
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,976
Yeah, I got a smaller cast
so I can use crutches now.

374
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,480
What happened to your face?

375
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,985
We'll talk about it later.

376
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,987
Uh-huh. -
Long story.

377
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,990
Your mole.

378
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,994
I had it removed.

379
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,996
Oh, you look beautiful.

380
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,498
Thanks.

381
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,513
Ready?
- Okay. Ready?

382
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,517
One and go!

383
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,025
Thank you.

384
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,530
That's awesome, guys.

385
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,532
Isn't he great?
- That was great.

386
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,034
Are you thirsty?

387
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,536
I'm thirsty. Margarita time!

388
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,538
Oogie boogie boogie!

389
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,042
So, how's married life treating you?

390
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,543
You know, it's actually not so bad.

391
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,545
She's kind of okay now that
I'm getting to know her.

392
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,047
Really.

393
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,050
I got to admit, I didn't think
you guys were a good match.

394
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,055
Well, it was weird,
but... he's opening up.

395
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,556
So it's all working out.

396
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,558
No, I didn't say that.

397
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,560
She still does a lot of stuff
that really pisses me off,

398
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,562
but I'm assuming I do the same thing.

399
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,563
That's great.

400
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,565
So it's working out?

401
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,067
Yeah!

402
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,068
It's all right.

403
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,572
Get out.
- No.

404
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,076
I just never expected you
to say anything like that.

405
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,581
It's been like a week now.
- I know, I know.

406
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,084
I've seen him naked now.

407
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,586
Hey, baby.

408
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,089
Hey.

409
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,094
How's it going?

410
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,097
Hey, man.

411
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,600
What's your problem?

412
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,103
Nothing.

413
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,108
Just thought the lady might
want to hang with a real man.

414
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:51,112
Thanks for the offer, but
I'm already with a real man.

415
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,614
Really?
- Really?

416
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,117
Yeah, really.

417
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,622
Well, when you change your
mind, I'll be over there.

418
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,127
Eww!

419
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:13,634
Drink?

420
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,646
What?
- Nothing.

421
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,650
Nothing.

422
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,652
I didn't ask.
- Oh.

423
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,659
Hey, listen.

424
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,660
What?

425
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,662
I meant to ask you.

426
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,665
Are you seeing someone?

427
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,667
Why?

428
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,669
Just curious.

429
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,174
Well...

430
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,176
Actually...
- What? You are?

431
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,178
No. Are you?

432
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,180
No, no.

433
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,681
No.

434
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,690
Hey.

435
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,214
You know, my dad u
sed to tell me stories

436
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,216
about these Indian princes

437
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,219
and how they'd ride to
their weddings on elephants.

438
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,728
I always dreamed I'd go to
my wedding on an elephant.

439
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,230
Like a prince?

440
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,233
Yeah.

441
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,236
You think it's silly?

442
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,739
No.

443
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,741
I think it's romantic.

444
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,248
Hey, guys.

445
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,250
Peanut?

446
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,752
What's up?
- You work here?

447
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,753
Yeah, part-time.

448
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,755
Monty here is gonna be a veterinarian.

449
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,257
Really?
- Uh-huh.

450
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,260
Yeah, he didn't want to, but
he figured it was the only way.

451
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,262
to stay close to his girlfriend
in the gorilla exhibit.

452
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,264
Oh, ha ha ha.

453
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,765
This guy, huh?

454
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,268
Yeah, listen, I actually got to
get back to her. She's lonely.

455
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,770
Cool. Say hi to wifey.
- See you guys at the party.

456
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,787
When are you going to
find me a nice girl?

457
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,305
Ameet.

458
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,309
I was wondering. if
it is possible for us

459
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,313
to broadcast the wedding
on this, um, Internet...

460
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,317
so our relatives in India
may share in our joy.

461
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,320
Sure, we can do that. No problem.

462
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,822
No problem? Excellent. Excellent.

463
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,825
You know, this Internet.

464
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,328
Well, actually, there is one problem.

465
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,829
What is that?

466
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,333
May I have your attention, please?

467
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,839
I'd like to take this
opportunity to say a few words.

468
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,342
I just want to tell all of you

469
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,344
how blessed I am

470
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,347
that Saima and I will be together.

471
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,352
She really has brought out
the passion in my heart.

472
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,355
Saima has shown me

473
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,858
what it really means
to be true to myself.

474
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,861
As a result,

475
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,865
I would like to announce
that, with Saima's blessing,

476
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,369
I'm quitting my job to pursue my dream.

477
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,383
I gotta dance!

478
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,938
I gotta dance!

479
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,455
Go, Ameet! Go, Ameet! Go, Ameet!

480
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,969
What are you doing, son?

481
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,971
This is a total disgrace.

482
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,974
I tell you, this marri
age cannot happen.

483
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,977
My daughter will nev
er marry some dreamer.

484
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,479
Papa?
- Don't worry.

485
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,482
We're just leaving this place. Come on!

486
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,990
Come, come. Don't
even look at him. Come!

487
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,492
Shit.

488
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,511
Hey.

489
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,015
Hey.

490
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,520
You were great last night.

491
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,021
Yeah?

492
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,023
Well, my parents weren't too pleased.

493
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,526
I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

494
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,027
They'll deal with it.

495
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,031
What's this?

496
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,533
Yeah.

497
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,035
I thought we'd celebrate our breakup.

498
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,538
Come on.

499
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,042
Okay.

500
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:15,115
This one time, a couple years ago,

501
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,118
I went out camping with the guys.

502
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,625
We found this spot way out,

503
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,128
right by this beautiful lake.

504
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:36,637
Anyway, everybody was all
passed out from drinking

505
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,138
the night before.

506
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,641
So...

507
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,143
I decided to go for a swim.

508
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,150
You know,

509
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,153
right there,

510
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,657
at that moment,

511
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,661
in the cool water with
not a care in the world,

512
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,165
I felt something.

513
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,671
Something I...

514
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,174
never felt before...

515
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,180
or since.

516
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,188
This... right here...

517
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,695
This is the closest I'll
ever get to that feeling.

518
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,209
To us.

519
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,212
Or... not to us.

520
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,248
Whoa!

521
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,264
I can't believe we got away with that.

522
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,767
You were good.

523
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,268
Whoo!

524
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,281
Oh, my.

525
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,447
Ameet!

526
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:57,955
Ameet. Ameet?

527
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,456
Huh?

528
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,458
What are you doing?

529
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,482
Saima!

530
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:32,489
Saima.

531
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,991
Coming.

532
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,000
Come. Sit here.

533
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:52,009
Listen, I don't want you to
worry about that awful fellow.

534
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:55,012
Ameet? He's not awful at all.

535
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,515
Do not say his name. I will
not hear it in this house.

536
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,518
I'll find a new husband for you to love.

537
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,521
No dreamers for you. Not at all.

538
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,024
I'll get an upstanding fellow.

539
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:10,027
Doctor. Maybe... engineer.

540
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,528
Trust me.

541
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,530
I will take care of everything.

542
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,032
I will.

543
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:18,035
But, Papa.

544
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,544
Good morning, Auntie.

545
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,561
Shoo!

546
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:47,564
You...

547
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,567
You are not welcome in this house.

548
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,069
But I
was--

549
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,072
I'm warning you. You
just go away from here!

550
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,074
But I was just--
- Just you go!

551
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,576
But I was--
- Just you go!

552
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,579
You shitty fellow, yaar. Go!

553
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,082
Go inside!

554
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,584
Go inside.

555
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,597
Hey, Ameet, can I play?

556
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:21,598
Sure.

557
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,608
Nice shot, Deep.

558
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,110
Thanks.

559
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:40,117
Ameet, are you okay?

560
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,119
No, not really.

561
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,121
Why not?

562
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,626
Do you remember when I
told you what love is?

563
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:52,129
Yeah.

564
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,630
I was wrong.

565
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,636
Well, not really. Let's
just say I was a little off.

566
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,639
Oh, you mean like your jump shot.

567
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,142
Yeah, like my jump shot.

568
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,148
Then what is love?

569
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,154
Well, do you know how good you feel

570
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,157
when you do something right?

571
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,660
Like when I beat the bad
guys in my video games?

572
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,663
Yeah, a little like that.

573
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:30,167
Imagine feeling a hundred
times as good as that.

574
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,169
all day long.

575
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,670
Wow.

576
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,172
I know.

577
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,174
Pretty incredible, huh?

578
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:44,681
When you meet some one who
makes you feel as good as that,

579
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,684
then you'll know what love is.

580
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:03,700
Hey.

581
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,704
How are you?

582
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,708
Saima...

583
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,711
we can make it through this.

584
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,713
We just...

585
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,715
I just need to know
you want to be with me.

586
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,217
Of course I do.
Of course, but--

587
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:21,718
But what?

588
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,721
Papa's lining up men for me to meet.

589
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,724
There's got to be a
way. We could just--

590
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:30,727
He won't even let me talk about you.

591
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,236
Come here.

592
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,240
Come here.

593
00:50:58,755 --> 00:50:59,756
What's this?

594
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,758
Open it.

595
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,781
There's more.

596
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,797
Hmm.

597
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,301
I understand you are an engineer.

598
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,802
Uh-huh.

599
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,305
And then I got my second PhD

600
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,807
in electro nuclear physics.

601
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:56,313
"Hello. My name... is... Shili."

602
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,316
Can she cook?

603
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,317
Uh-huh.

604
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,319
"Uh-huh." That's all?

605
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,821
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

606
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,825
"Women find me... exciting."

607
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,327
You?

608
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,828
How about some tandoori food?

609
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,330
You don't diet?

610
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,331
Sorry about that.

611
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,332
Uh-huh.

612
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,335
I like tandoori food.
- Next!

613
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,838
And degenerative chemical manipulation.

614
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,840
Um, can she cook?

615
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,342
You live here in town?

616
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:26,843
Oh, yes.

617
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,345
Oh, God.

618
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,851
Yes?

619
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,353
Yes. Hello?

620
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,358
Eating so much.

621
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,859
Eh?

622
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,361
Huh?

623
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,362
Huh?

624
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,364
God.

625
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:52,369
"You... can... not... lose.

626
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,372
"I... am... the...

627
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:58,875
total... package."

628
00:52:58,875 --> 00:52:59,876
Package?

629
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,879
What a package.

630
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,881
We don't deal in packages.

631
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,883
Carry on.

632
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,391
I don't know.

633
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,894
I'm not impressed. Not
a winner in the lot.

634
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,405
Cancel, cancel, cancel.

635
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,415
Stupid.

636
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,427
God, send me some husband material,

637
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,930
not animals, okay?

638
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,934
Send me someone good.
Some... some eligible...

639
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,469
Namaste.
- Namaste.

640
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,971
Asshole.

641
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,473
No, um, Ashol.

642
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:37,974
Ashol.
- Yes.

643
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,976
A computer programmer.

644
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:41,978
Yes, sir, I'm a computer programmer.

645
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,482
I have recently started my
own Web site design business.

646
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,983
Oh.

647
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:50,487
And, uh, why do you want to get married?

648
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,990
Well, I feel it's the
right time in my life

649
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,494
to start to work with someone
and build a life together.

650
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,995
Fine.

651
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:02,499
And, uh, what abou t your family?

652
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,504
Unfortunately, both
my parents have passed.

653
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,005
I'm an only child.

654
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,007
I'm sorry to hear that.

655
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,011
Would you like to meet Saima?

656
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,513
Sure. I'd love to.

657
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,017
Saima!

658
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:23,520
Saima!

659
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,522
Saima!

660
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,024
Come here.

661
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,527
Come, come, come, come.

662
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,028
Saima.

663
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,030
Ashol, Saima.

664
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,033
I would like for you to
sit and talk with him.

665
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,034
Come, sit.

666
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,538
Come. Sit.

667
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,043
And let me know when you are done, okay?

668
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,546
We're done.
- Ah, Saima!

669
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,549
Please, beta.

670
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,051
You know, Saima...

671
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,060
You're lookin' good, babe.

672
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,062
What are you doing here?

673
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,064
Looking for a wife.

674
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:10,567
Well, you've come to the wrong place.

675
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,070
I don't think so.

676
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,073
In fact, I think I've hit the jackpot.

677
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,581
Oh, nice ass.

678
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,085
Oh, the things I'm
going to do with that.

679
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,086
Oh!

680
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,590
Oh, yes.

681
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,594
Got to love that ass.

682
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:43,600
True happiness comes
when you love your wife,

683
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:48,104
you love your home and
keep your values intact.

684
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,607
Hmm?

685
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,610
Sir, I'm honored to have your
daughter's hand in marriage.

686
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,118
And I promise to devote myself to
providing her with a secure life.

687
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,622
I'm sure, I'm sure.

688
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,625
God bless you.

689
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,126
Okay.

690
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,628
Good night.

691
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,641
My dream boy. I got him.

692
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,142
Got him.

693
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,151
Ashol, my future
son-in-law.

694
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,153
But he's creepy.

695
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:40,156
What creepy-sheepy?
Such a nice fellow.

696
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:43,660
But, Papa, doesn't my
happines mean anything to you?

697
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,162
This is for your happiness only.

698
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:49,165
Did you hear the things he said?

699
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:52,168
Saima, where are you going?

700
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,673
I'm going to the library.

701
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,676
You really think I'm some fool?

702
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:03,179
I know you have been meeting
that fellow. I know it!

703
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,682
So you're not going out to study.

704
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:08,184
You're going to study at home.

705
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,687
But I-- - At
home, that's all.

706
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,188
Up.

707
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,696
Where's Saima's mom? I'm so confused.

708
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,199
Where has she kept my tea?

709
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,202
Saima's mom, where's my tea?

710
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:01,738
Ow!

711
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,240
Ow!

712
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,245
Sorry.

713
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,755
What-- What are
you doing here?

714
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,758
I missed you.

715
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,261
Drop the dupatta.

716
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,766
You're crazy.

717
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,268
Yeah.

718
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,853
Saima?

719
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,855
Papa?

720
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:02,859
Saima, did you hear anything?

721
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,360
Like what?

722
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,362
Some... scraping?

723
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,867
No.

724
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,368
No?

725
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,374
I can't sleep now.

726
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:22,879
Can you go downstairs
and make me some cha?

727
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:26,382
Papa, why don't you take your medicine?

728
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,386
Okay, beta. I'll do that.

729
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,891
I'm old. My bones are weak.

730
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,894
But that's okay. You don't worry.

731
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:39,896
I'll make my tea.

732
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:43,900
No, Papa, I'll make it for you.

733
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,401
You'll make
it? - Mm-hmm.

734
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,903
Thank you.

735
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:48,905
Some scraping...

736
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,422
Shh.
- But--

737
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,464
What's up?

738
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,466
Uhh.

739
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,987
Where's Ameet?

740
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,992
What happened?

741
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,994
Your father...

742
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,496
came after me.

743
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,998
Had to hide.

744
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:47,026
Aha!

745
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,538
Hey!

746
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,558
What?

747
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,078
Bye.

748
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,091
Stay away from my daughter!

749
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,093
Yourafka!

750
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,599
Stupid fellow.

751
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,115
Damn.

752
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,618
Did you see those things?

753
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,627
You know, you should get a boob job.

754
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,632
What? What's wrong?

755
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,635
Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

756
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,137
Marrying me.

757
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,640
You know I don't love you,
and you know I never will.

758
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,645
me. You will grow to love

759
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:50,149
You can only resist
my charm for so long.

760
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,651
I can resist you forever.

761
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,653
Asshole.

762
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:59,658
Listen, you little bitch.

763
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,660
We're getting married.

764
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,662
If I say you get a boob
job, then you get a boob job.

765
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,664
You do what I say. Get it?

766
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:12,671
Ma'am, are you all right?

767
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,674
I'm fine.
- Bathroom's this way.

768
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,686
How do I get out of here?

769
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:31,690
Is there a back door?
- That's off-limits.

770
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,692
Where is it?

771
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:48,707
Ameet! Ameet!

772
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:49,708
Saima.

773
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,212
What's wrong?

774
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,214
He's awful!

775
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:11,730
Figured you'd go running back.
- You want a piece of me?

776
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:17,736
Just in case you don't understand...

777
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,238
Hey!

778
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,243
What are you doing? Wait! No!

779
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,757
Oh...

780
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,260
Are you okay?
- I'll live.

781
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:46,765
I can't believe this is happening.

782
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,767
What else could go wrong?

783
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,770
Well, um, I don't know
how to tell you this,

784
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,773
but they decided to move the wedding up.

785
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,276
What? When? Where?

786
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,279
Well, they already had the banquet
hall  reserved for you and Saima,

787
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,282
so they just kind of figured
they'd go ahead and use it.

788
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,284
But that's tomorrow.
- I know.

789
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,786
I'm helping Nadi with
the Internet broadcast.

790
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:08,787
It's her mother.

791
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:11,790
Oh, so you're helping them now?

792
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:15,294
Yeah. It's my wife's best friend.

793
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,296
What about your best friend?

794
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,802
Ameet, wait a minute.

795
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:25,648
Yeah, that's right. You
will come on time, huh?

796
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,650
That's very, very important.

797
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,652
Yeah. Of course, food is arranged.

798
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,654
Everything's arranged.
-Good, good, good.

799
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,656
Dev, see if Mom is ready or not.

800
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,659
Listen, that holy man
should come on time.

801
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:38,661
Yeah, yeah, he's very busy.

802
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:40,663
Just a minut e. Yeah, yeah.

803
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:44,166
Papa, please.

804
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:48,170
Is there any way for me to speak to Saima's
mother? Because you are confusing me.

805
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,672
Come, come.

806
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,173
Come.

807
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,182
Ah.

808
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,184
Now, tell me.

809
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:03,686
What is it?

810
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,689
Please. Don't make me do this.

811
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,692
Saima, it is all for the best.

812
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,193
But I don't love Ashol.

813
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,195
Beta, love will come.

814
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:16,198
Why do you kee p saying that?

815
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,200
Look at Ruby and Bobby.

816
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,202
Are they not happy and in love?

817
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:21,203
That's different.

818
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,205
How? How is it different?

819
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:28,711
Ruby wasn't in love with someone
else when she married Bobby.

820
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,212
Saima.

821
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:33,716
Saima, you're too young
to know what love is.

822
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:35,718
Ashol is a fine young man.

823
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:38,721
And he will give you security.

824
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,222
No, he won't.

825
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:42,725
There's something's creepy about him.

826
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:44,226
I don't trust him.

827
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,228
He'll take good care of you.

828
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,731
Didn't he take care of you
when that fool attacked?

829
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,232
But that's just it.

830
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:52,234
Ameet didn't
atta-- - Shh!

831
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:56,739
Go get ready. This
is your big day, okay?

832
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:38,340
Bobby, get dressed!

833
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,843
In a minute, honey.

834
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,846
Bobby, the wedding sta
rts in less than an hour.

835
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,348
I have to make sure the Internet
telecast works before we go.

836
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:49,852
Just give me a minute.
- Okay.

837
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:53,856
ted. Good. Let me check the search
engine to see if it'ââs lis

838
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,861
Okay, Saima's name comes up fine, and...

839
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:02,865
What's this?

840
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,867
What?

841
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,368
Oh, my God.

842
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,872
Oh, my God!

843
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,376
Call-- Call Ameet.
I'll get ready.

844
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,885
It's busy. -
Well, try-- Aah!

845
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:23,886
Bobby?

846
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:37,900
Ashol, my son!

847
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,402
I really welcome you to my family.

848
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,404
I welcome you.

849
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,406
A real welcome!

850
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:50,913
Ameet.

851
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,419
Do you love Saima?

852
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,922
Yes.

853
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,926
Then go and do something about it, son.

854
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:09,431
If she makes you happy,
she makes us happy.

855
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:17,940
Ameet!

856
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,942
Call Bobby on his cell phone.

857
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:21,944
He has something to tell you.

858
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:36,458
Bobby, we're gonna miss
the wedding!  Hurry up!

859
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:39,461
Coming!

860
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,966
Come on, Bobby! I'm
going to go start the car.

861
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,968
No! Don't start the car!

862
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,970
I'll be right there!
- All right! Hurry!

863
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,472
I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying!

864
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,477
Come on, Bobby! Don't do this to me!

865
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:16,999
Yeah, that's my baby!

866
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,493
Where have you been, man?

867
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,994
Just go.

868
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,264
Hi. How are you?

869
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,767
Fine. Very good.

870
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:03,775
Okay, ready, gentlemen?

871
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,777
We are starting the ceremony.

872
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,279
Here.

873
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:27,799
Beta, what's wrong?

874
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,801
I can't do this.

875
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:33,305
Saima, stop this nonsense.

876
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:37,309
I'm sorry, Papa. I love
you, but I love Ameet.

877
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:38,810
I can't do this.

878
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:41,813
Saima!

879
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,326
Just hear me out for one minute.

880
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,831
I don't need to spend the
rest of my life with you

881
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:02,834
to fall in love with you.

882
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,836
I don't even need to be
with you for a little while

883
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:07,339
to find out that you're kind of okay.

884
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,344
All I know is I spent most of my life

885
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:15,347
prophesizing about love.

886
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,849
And now I know what it is.

887
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:21,353
I feel what it is,

888
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,356
and I can't let go of that.

889
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:25,857
I won't.

890
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:44,376
Let me take care of this.

891
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:50,265
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

892
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,267
If you could please turn your attention

893
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:55,053
to the screen in front of
you, that would be wonderful.

894
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,054
Thank you.

895
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,063
That's--

896
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,068
This is Ashol.

897
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:12,570
I'm your fantasy man.

898
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,577
Oh, my God.

899
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,586
This is Ashol.

900
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:31,589
Do you like what you see?

901
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:45,103
For as little as 19.95 a month,

902
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,605
you could see all of me.

903
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:52,861
What a perv, man.
- Ohh!

904
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,787
Come to papa. Who's your daddy?

905
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:05,790
Don't believe it, sir! They put
my face on somebody else's body.

906
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:09,294
Hey, asshole!

907
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:12,797
Yes!
- Yeah!

908
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:21,306
I'm sorry. I did not know.

909
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:24,809
Go. Go ahead.

910
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,320
Honey...
- What?

911
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:43,828
Come, come.

01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:49,334
Nice ride.

913
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,836
My princess.

914
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,838
You know what's scary?

915
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:55,840
What?

916
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,842
I love you.

917
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:24,235
Now, what about you two?
