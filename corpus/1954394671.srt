1
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>This is a true story.</i>

2
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,870
Jimmy!

3
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:03,596
Little Brother!

4
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:07,044
Hey Jimmy!

5
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,988
Little Brother, wake up!

6
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,640
Wake up!

7
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,258
Come on!

8
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,411
It's time to get up.

9
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,217
Are you still in pain?

10
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,303
Black girls!

11
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:29,928
Come on!

12
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,049
- You coming to town?
- No.

13
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:52,334
Cows busted the trough.
Got ot go fix it.

14
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,350
- You wonder I should leave the horse?
- No.

15
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,143
Are you sure?

16
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,787
My headache is coming...

17
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,042
I have the tickets here
for my brother and me.

18
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:15,321
The army sent them to us.  And
I have an authorization letter too.

19
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:12,520
You've awake now.

20
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:30,136
TOPEKA, KANSAS

21
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:35,299
THE MENNINGER SCHOOL OF PSYCHIATRY
STAFFS and RESIDENTS, 1946

22
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,429
You went blind?

23
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,165
Third time this year, sir.

24
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,259
You don't need to "sir" me.

25
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,554
When it happens

26
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,306
does everything go black, or...

27
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,854
It's flecks of light.

28
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,189
But then they go away.

29
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,775
Where were you injured?

30
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,193
In France.

31
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,854
No, I meant
where on your body.

32
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,543
He fractured his skull in the war.

33
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,828
And the Fort Benton VA said that
they couldn't do anything for us so

34
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,288
they sent us here.

35
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,589
That's a long trip.

36
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,333
They even paid for our tickets.

37
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,918
Well, they damn right to.

38
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,920
The Winter Hospital is the
best place in the country

39
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,497
for brain traumas.

40
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,394
After the war, my brother
lost his job with the railroad.

41
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,314
He couldn't hear the trains
anymore, because of his ears.

42
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,399
And then it was his eyes.

43
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,822
The headache are the worse.
He can't even breathe.  It scares me.

44
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,659
We keep him with us now, at my ranch.

45
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:58,629
My husband says the army
didn't do the x-rays right.

46
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,129
Maybe there is a shard of bone
or something that they missed.

47
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,131
Okay, it's on.

48
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,052
We'll run a whole new set of tests
and get you back on your feet.

49
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,865
You fought for your country.

50
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:32,159
This is the least they can do for you.

51
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,246
If they open my brain

52
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,872
it will kill me.

53
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,208
Sunday

54
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,877
you can go to church.

55
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,422
Hello, time to go now.

56
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,383
Your brother will be home soon.

57
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,390
It wasn't a life you are living,

58
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,891
you are only half alive.

59
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,313
Next please!

60
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,569
- Name please?
- James Picard.

61
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,196
When were you demobbed?

62
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,031
February 1945.

63
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,370
- Division?
- 66th Armored Regiment. 10 Corp. Corporal.

64
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,581
Do you know your blood type?

65
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,332
No, ma'am.

66
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,633
Are you married?

67
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,219
Divorced.

68
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,139
Any children?

69
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,891
Not exactly.

70
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,245
How can someone
"not exactly" have children?

71
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,969
- Another man brought up my daughter.
- Oh.

72
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,587
Six foot one and a half.

73
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,232
I just want you to describe
the situation you see,

74
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,720
what the people think
and what the outcome is.

75
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,303
You're not answering?

76
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,651
Eyes right.

77
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,538
Down.

78
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,241
What do you see on the card?

79
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,286
I'll tell you about a picture
I see every night.

80
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,039
A picture of a high wall.

81
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,501
Long and deep.

82
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,620
And I was standing on top of it.

83
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,221
I always feel like I want to fall off

84
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,523
but I never do.

85
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,025
And here?

86
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,592
Is this a dream that you're telling me?

87
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,096
It's in my head though...

88
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,538
Our x-ray shows no
sign of a current fracture.

89
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,458
Possible traces but
there's a shadow here.

90
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,759
Your guess?

91
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,380
Diploid vascular markings.

92
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,681
Nothing serious.

93
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,135
He was wounded
during the war, wasn't he?

94
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,970
The records unclear.

95
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,432
He supposedly was in a coma
for more than two days but...

96
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,850
I really can't say.

97
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,020
I saw a scar.
He gets disability compensation.

98
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,981
He's definitely partial
hearing loss in the left ear.

99
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,616
The eardrum?

100
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,110
But I found no physiological
explanation for it.

101
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,395
Cerebral activity is perfectly normal.

102
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,948
We could make him some glasses...

103
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,451
He has diplopia or
narrow gaze, that's all.

104
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,752
Great!

105
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:05,205
So we have a vet who is
an invalid in perfect health!

106
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,187
Dr. Holt?
He passed his psychologicals?

107
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,424
Patient refused to comply.

108
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,367
He kept saying his head hurt.

109
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,849
Jokl, have you seen our new recruit?

110
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,415
No.  Not yet.
I'm seeing him tomorrow.

111
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,979
But I little listed all symptoms
you have described.

112
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,148
Migraines, diplopia,

113
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,067
bright spots, suffocation,

114
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,061
ventricular pain,

115
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,488
temporary paralysis of the left arm,

116
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,281
hemiplegic sensation.

117
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,540
I'm adding catatonia
and autistic withdrawal...

118
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm afraid it rather
sounds like mental disorder.

119
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,414
Sometimes

120
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,035
the guys says he doesn't
know if he's awake or dreaming.

121
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,534
So you have, cat and rat case.

122
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,179
You mean... schizophrenia?

123
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,466
Gentlemen, we were supposed
to create a haven here.

124
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,435
For every man.

125
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,398
Have we ever treated an...?

126
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,699
No.

127
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,486
We only have one Indian.
The catatonic.

128
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,283
Shelling in Okinawa.

129
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,750
Dear sir,

130
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:26,078
Dr. Menninger suggested
that I write to you.

131
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,847
We have an Indian patient

132
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,582
who in terms of our usual criteria,

133
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,961
may conceivably be psychotic.

134
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,980
At the same time, it is possible

135
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:40,509
that we maybe misevaluating
his psychiatric status

136
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,719
since he maybe merely an Indian,

137
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,222
whose personality and behavior

138
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,766
we do not fully understand.

139
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:52,136
For this reason, a consultation
with an anthropologist is required.

140
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,607
Dr. RR Holt, reporting to
the the ward physician.

141
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,928
BROOKLYN, NY

142
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,328
It's for me.
(Thank you).

143
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,208
Georges Devereux speaking.

144
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,669
What a pain to have
to call you in a bar.

145
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,171
<i>Oh Karl , my friend.</i>

146
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,984
I'm a bit pissed at you these days,
but it's great to hear your voice.

147
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,844
What's new in Topeka?

148
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,262
Well I'll look into that...

149
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,056
Did you get our letter
from our psychologist?

150
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,934
Dr. Holt got it.

151
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,687
And it happens that
I am free at the moment.

152
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,608
Well don't get carried away.
I still can't bring you aboard here.

153
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,611
<i>All we need is a
psychiatric evaluation.</i>

154
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,945
<i>We have an Indian here.</i>

155
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,655
Which ethnic group?

156
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,574
I'm looking at the report now...

157
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,037
<i>- Siksika.
- A blackfoot!</i>

158
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,843
<i>Don't tell me you know the blackfoot.</i>

159
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,625
Two weeks ago, Margaret Mead
came to town and

160
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,048
told me fascinating
things about the Blackfoot.

161
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,796
The family structure is
so close to the Mojaves.

162
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,175
I'm sure you'll be able
to lend us a hand.

163
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,718
The administration

164
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,838
<i>has agreed to one
or two consultations.</i>

165
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,223
<i>Three days tops.</i>

166
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,433
Yeah I have the flight
schedule right here,

167
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,435
I can be in Topeka tonight.

168
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,021
<i>- You will be taking a train.
- Perfect...</i>

169
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,397
Second class.

170
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,650
And this is not a full time job offer,

171
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,368
<i>it is a one shot consultation.</i>

172
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,917
- See you soon.
- Goodbye.

173
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,218
Goodbye.

174
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,158
Topeka!

175
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,363
On behalf of the
Veterans Administration

176
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:32,496
and the Winter Hospital staff

177
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,528
I'd like to welcome our newcomers.

178
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,291
<i>Men, we have lots of telephones...</i>

179
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,793
You have to take this.

180
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,413
<i>... encourage you to stay in touch</i>

181
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:41,964
<i>with your loved ones and
they are free at cost.</i>

182
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,759
<i>If you have any questions about
your compensation or your disability</i>

183
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,804
<i>let us know and we'll
help to the best we can.</i>

184
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,473
<i>We have incoming mail at 8</i>

185
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,225
<i>and mail goes out at 4.</i>

186
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,598
<i>There is a bus definitely twice a day.</i>

187
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,994
<i> If you have any questions,
my door is always open.</i>

188
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:23,754
<i>Feel free to come and we'll take
care of whatever issues you have.</i>

189
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,336
- What the fuck.
- Come on.

190
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:32,555
- Come on, get him off!
- Take it up!

191
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,728
<i>Somebody call the duty doctors.</i>

192
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,411
A chance for your light?

193
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,986
That kid scared you
a little, didn't he?

194
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,505
I don't know what I'm doing here.

195
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,091
I can't say grobal.

196
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,156
Boilermaker, please.

197
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,059
Can I see your ID?

198
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,647
If the cops show up, you're Mexican.

199
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:26,234
So, where were you?
Army, Navy?

200
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,153
Army.

201
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,164
You're at the hospital
for busted heads, right?

202
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,789
I'm in the dark there.

203
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,833
Nobody tells me a fucking thing.

204
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,430
You a Pawnee?

205
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,052
Can't be.
'Cause I'd know you.

206
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,929
What you doing in Topeka?

207
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,349
I have never seen an Indian
nurse at the Winter Hospital.

208
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,434
You must be a labourer.

209
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,273
10 o'clock curfew?
Baby got to go to bed?

210
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,527
Rise and shine!

211
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,668
What's the matter boys?
Time to clean up.

212
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,069
Wakey! Wakey!

213
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:55,073
Was it necessary?

214
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,493
The alcohol and the tranquilizers.
I couldn't take that chance.

215
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,750
Do Indians commit suicide?

216
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,294
I don't know.

217
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,351
The ticket, please sir.

218
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:27,971
- Your ticket.
- Uh, of course. Where did I put that?

219
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:32,313
This?
No. Here it is.

220
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,118
Welcome to the Wild West!

221
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,414
It's good to see you again, Devereux.

222
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,224
Your client is no piece of cake.

223
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,084
He hasn't spoken one
word in two weeks.

224
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,128
Yesterday he went into town and

225
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,090
came back dead drunk,
with a bottle of liquor.

226
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,550
Which have been to closest to war...

227
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,803
- He was violent?
- Oh no.

228
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,930
The guy was very quiet.

229
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,050
Behold our Indian brave!

230
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,478
You already know Dr. Jokl,
our psychiatrist, and Dr. Holt.

231
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,272
This is Dr. Devereux.

232
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,173
Good morning.

233
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:53,793
He came from New York just for you.

234
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,194
To record, push down.

235
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,761
Oh thank you.
I don't think we will need it.

236
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,690
Have a nice chat.

237
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,496
You can have a seat if you wish.

238
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,529
May I introduce myself.

239
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,375
I am the hospital anthropologist.

240
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,393
I am interested in Indians.

241
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,103
And if you don't mind,

242
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,506
I'd like to find out
a few things about you.

243
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,526
What is your Indian name?

244
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,614
Oh-Gunidep-Puyop.

245
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,077
Oh, I don't speak Pikunni.
May I ask you what it means?

246
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,538
"Everybody talks about him."

247
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:52,484
Which society does
your family belong to?

248
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,812
"Crazy Dogs" society.

249
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:57,814
And to what church do you belong?

250
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,759
I am Catholic.

251
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:05,063
Dr. Holt told me you
dream a great deal.

252
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,691
In what language do you dream in?

253
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,771
In English, most of the time.

254
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,316
What is the blackfoot
word for "dream"?

255
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,402
Ipa-pong-kaa.

256
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,909
As you can hear
I was born in Europe and

257
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,621
my English sounds a bit rough.

258
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,563
- Does it bother you?
- No.

259
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:35,878
So...

260
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,172
Tell me about your parents.

261
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,942
My father died of heart
trouble when I was five.

262
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,983
I was raised by my older
sister and brother-in-law.

263
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,137
What about your mother?

264
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,983
My mother was very strict.

265
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,611
Was your mother
a 'manly hearted' woman?

266
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:04,588
Huh.

267
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,616
Did I say something silly?

268
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,119
How do you know that?

269
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:14,257
In Mojave we say
'manly hearted' woman.

270
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,419
How do you say it in blackfoot?

271
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,254
Mukakya-ki.

272
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,838
My mother ran her place like a man.

273
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,224
My sister is the same way.

274
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,430
Can you talk to me about your sister?

275
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,201
My sister doesn't drink or smoke.

276
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,988
She's a mission school girl.

277
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,990
She is the oldest child.

278
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,702
She married to an important
functionary of the tribe.

279
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,287
His name is Jack.

280
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,416
By what kinship
the rimbulu called him?

281
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,879
My brother-in-law,

282
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,505
Nestamu.

283
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,759
Do you have any brothers?

284
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,637
Yes, but I don't see much of them.

285
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,431
I am the youngest.

286
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,059
You seem to think of your sister

287
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,269
much the same way
you think of your mother.

288
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,856
They are almost the same in my mind.

289
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:23,318
You admire your
sister a lot, don't you?

290
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:25,318
Yes

291
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,587
And what do you do
as an anthropologist?

292
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:36,498
Well...

293
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,793
we study all aspects of human beings.

294
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,636
Language, techniques,

295
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,296
physiology...

296
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,117
That's why you want
to learn Indian words?

297
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:48,318
Yes.

298
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,470
I lived with the Mojave for two years.

299
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,607
- In the desert?
- Yes.

300
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,061
I was able to learn their
language and their history.

301
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,147
What is life like for the Mojave?

302
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,817
Not as desperate as the Navajos.

303
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:07,230
But they have a pretty hard time.

304
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,107
Not to offend you,

305
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,823
but whites do not like us much.

306
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,247
That doesn't affect me at all.

307
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,257
It is strange living in a place

308
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:38,134
where people are soul sick.

309
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,632
- Do you want to smoke?
- No.

310
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:49,262
First, I brush some ink on the paper.

311
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,248
And then

312
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,668
you can draw with your finger.

313
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,388
Easy, here we are.

314
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,625
What should I draw?

315
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,427
Whatever you want.

316
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,886
I'm not good at drawing.

317
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,387
What is it?

318
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,724
A landscape.

319
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,309
Perfect.

320
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,313
Both drawings are
separated into 3 strips.

321
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,732
But the boundaries are not cut off.

322
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,860
There is a hidden part
here in the buttress.

323
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,363
And a route crosses
through the strips.

324
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,324
So there is no fractioning.

325
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,740
I see no trace of schizophrenia,

326
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:39,245
neither latent, nor ***

327
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,915
- Are you sure?
- I'd stake my life on it.

328
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,125
This man is not mad.

329
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,212
He must be removed as quickly
as possible from the closed ward.

330
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,840
George!  Two pictures
are all you need?

331
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,175
Oh, more than enough.

332
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,719
At the base of this drawing

333
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,139
a completely repressed
pre-Oedipal stage.

334
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,474
Here, a house.

335
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,701
for a right-handed heterosexual male,

336
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:04,187
the mother, or a mother equivalent.

337
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,981
Two mountains, are the breasts.

338
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:11,236
And threatening clouds
above his sister's ranch.

339
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,405
The patient depicts
himself in front of a barn.

340
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,450
He wouldn't talk to anybody,
doctors or patients.

341
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,566
You asked for my opinion, here it is.

342
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,412
Jimmy  Picard is not crazy.

343
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,413
Or else you have to lock up
half of our fellow citizens.

344
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,377
So, what is he suffering from?

345
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,879
I guess what we all suffer from.

346
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,249
So what do you suggests we do?

347
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,261
George, you know how I feel.

348
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,939
But the AAP needs
paperwork, anything legal.

349
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,441
No!  Karl, they'll get their papers.

350
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,936
Hey, you're not even an MD.

351
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,980
I know, no psychoanalysis.

352
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,398
Just counseling.

353
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,733
Research counseling, got it?

354
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,820
- Control session with Jokl?
- Jokl.

355
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:57,348
If they don't work out, you
go straight back to New York.

356
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,916
Terrific!

357
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,389
I may have *** administration wise,

358
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,375
but let me tell you, Mon'Amie...

359
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,669
that doesn't allow
you to break the rules.

360
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,054
Which rules am I going to break here?

361
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,208
Don't be exuberant!

362
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,177
Is your British friend
still in New York?

363
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,431
- Madeleine?
- Très charmant! (Very charming)

364
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,934
Jeanetta and I were wondering
if she might pay us a visit.

365
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,777
Nah, I bet she would.

366
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:33,026
If Jimmy is not sick,
then isn't that good news?

367
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,273
Since we found nothing physiological,

368
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:39,231
we were wondering whether
the illness may be psychiatric.

369
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:43,161
However Mr. Devereux doesn't
consider you a schizophrenic.

370
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,213
Then...

371
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,207
I can go home?

372
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,151
I think you're in real pain.

373
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:54,377
You can see Mr. Devereux,
for a while, an hour a day.

374
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:58,033
He can't treat you, in
the strict sense of the word.

375
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,202
But maybe he can help.

376
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:08,102
You should not have drank here.

377
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,812
- You should drink less.
- Hello!

378
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:13,616
Dr. Devereux has asked us to
move you into another ward.

379
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,578
Hello, my name is Alma.

380
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,374
What do we have here?

381
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,626
I have the school records.

382
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,671
Look!
They thought the world of you.

383
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,134
You can take your time now.

384
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,721
The rapport was good
and simplify sufficient.

385
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:30,309
The patient reacted in a
spontaneous and normal manner.

386
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:34,897
I decided to study
and counsel the patient.

387
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,571
Come in, please.

388
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,873
Follow me.

389
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,527
It's an unorthodox
setting, but anyway...

390
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,518
You don't look too good.

391
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,087
Just a slight fever.
Don't worry.

392
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,607
Did you dream anything?

393
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,235
I had a dream last night.

394
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,613
I was butchering some beef.

395
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,698
What breed of cattle was it?

396
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,617
White face, Hereford.

397
00:30:28,932 --> 00:30:30,482
Hereford.

398
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:37,293
What was the locality of the dream?

399
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,378
On my sister's ranch.

400
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:44,548
Doctor, when I go to bed,
I'm always short of breath.

401
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,137
Could you explain how it feels?

402
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:54,755
Well, as soon as I lied down,
I'm afraid my heart will miss a beat.

403
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,531
I always have to get up
and get some water.

404
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,318
I also have these
attacks in the afternoon.

405
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,564
Stepping back to your dream.
What does it make you think of?

406
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,606
The other night, I read an
article in a magazine,

407
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:17,165
about a... couple in Alaska.

408
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,919
And they butchered three moose.

409
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,313
Do you think that's possible?

410
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,924
That's a lot of meat for two people.

411
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,709
Well, I couldn't say.

412
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,226
The night before,,
I had a nightmare.

413
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,273
<i>I had a fight with a man.</i>

414
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:45,069
<i>I could not run away,
or raise my arms.</i>

415
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,613
<i>I couldn't yell for help.</i>

416
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,128
<i>The man took out his knife
and went through me.</i>

417
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,414
<i>I woke up and</i>

418
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,699
<i>jumped out of bed.</i>

419
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,127
I don't know who the man was.

420
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,651
How would the old Blackfoot
interpret such a dream?

421
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,722
I don't know much about
the old Blackfoot ways.

422
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,809
What did this man look like?

423
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,562
He was big and tall.

424
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,648
That much I remember.

425
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:25,818
Was this man an Indian or a white?

426
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:29,547
The man was white.
He was an American.

427
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,890
He wore blue overalls.

428
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,203
- Well, do your brothers dress like that?
- No.

429
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,415
My brothers wear dressy
clothes to go into town.

430
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,083
How about your father?

431
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,547
My father wore a blue
serge suit to go to church.

432
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,300
I was very young when he died.
I don't remember much about him.

433
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,956
Do you see any connection
between the two dreams?

434
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,667
They both have knives.

435
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,794
The Blackfoot believe that
dreams foretold the future.

436
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:08,861
We think that dreams shed
a little light on the past.

437
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,447
That is why I am interested in them.

438
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:15,918
Come on, just say anything
that goes through your mind.

439
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,376
I wonder about going back to school.

440
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,921
They offer an AAD in leatherwork.

441
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,134
I got a good record in college.

442
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,805
My sister brought the records.
They're with my papers.

443
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,564
I got a daughter, you know.

444
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,434
I saw that in your file.

445
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,786
I had her very young.

446
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,157
Her mother died three years ago.

447
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,493
Her family is from Spokane.

448
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,245
I married another woman.

449
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,457
What did you call her, the
woman who had a child by you?

450
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,668
I called her Jane.

451
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,179
It tsi kay sha pini akii.

452
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,342
It  means:
"Bright Eyed Girl".

453
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,760
Very nice.

454
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,015
I want my daughter
to come and live with me.

455
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,516
She's in high school.

456
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:26,522
She doesn't like being with her
grandmother, though she doesn't complain.

457
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,984
The two of them live all
alone way out in the country.

458
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,430
Later on, maybe
I'll get married again.

459
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,241
What is her Indian name?

460
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,702
She has none.

461
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,372
- Well, tell me what is her English name?
- Mary Lou.

462
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,874
How old is Mary Lou?

463
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,417
Thirteen.

464
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,352
Is she already a woman?

465
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:52,156
I mean, is your daughter
passed her puberty?

466
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,250
She visited us...

467
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,971
Two years ago, I lived
with a Kaini woman.

468
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:03,309
She got along very well with Mary Lou.

469
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,770
Afterwards she went back to Canada.

470
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,006
How old was this Kaini woman?

471
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,583
She was my age.

472
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,821
Do Blackfoot usually marry
a woman their own age?

473
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,740
I never thought about that.

474
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,868
What kind of a wife do you want?

475
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,439
Okay.

476
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,218
I have to leave you now.
It is four thirty.

477
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,921
I come to see you tomorrow.

478
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,590
Doctor...

479
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,908
In the last few days, I
haven't had any headaches.

480
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,270
Well, you see!

481
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,558
Not only are you not going crazy here,
but even your headaches have stopped.

482
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,859
That's right.

483
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,855
I'm *** .

484
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:52,164
Good day.

485
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,465
Tomorrow.

486
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:09,482
Hello Jimmy!

487
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,546
Dr. Devereux asked me to tell you,
he cannot see you today.

488
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,348
He is not feeling well
and need some bed rest.

489
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,259
But not to worry, he'll
be on his feet tomorrow.

490
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,021
Desmond?

491
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,396
Is that where the French doctor lives?

492
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,191
All the new doctors stay there.

493
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,706
<i>Look at this.</i>

494
00:36:49,015 --> 00:36:50,615
<i>Good Lord.</i>

495
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,718
Peace time!

496
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,588
Anyhow, he was on borrowed time.

497
00:37:44,746 --> 00:37:47,556
I'm not getting up.
Please have this chair.

498
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,836
You don't look any better.

499
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:54,996
No, I'll be perfectly fine,
thank you.   Please, sit.

500
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:07,709
I've been divorced for years.

501
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:12,665
Yet I feel like I'm just loafing
around waiting for my ex-wife.

502
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,126
What do you feel you
lost with this woman?

503
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:19,264
I'm sorry about my house.

504
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,556
Well, do you mean house or home?

505
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:25,344
House and all that land.
900 acres.

506
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:31,058
You see when I left, Lily got
the house... and all that land.

507
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,769
And she had no kids to worry about.

508
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:39,731
Then... when I came
back from the war

509
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,696
I got off the train,
I had no place to go.

510
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,200
She had taken up with another man.

511
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,871
And this man was
living off my army pay.

512
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,716
I felt like killing him.

513
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,143
I know how it feels.

514
00:38:58,228 --> 00:39:02,143
My brother-in-law told me not
to ruin my life over a woman.

515
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,174
So instead,

516
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,177
I got Jack's car,
went to the lawyer,

517
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,805
and the divorce came
through in nine days.

518
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,143
I miss her...

519
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,263
How about sexual relations?

520
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:21,350
I had girls back home.

521
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,194
That's a nice pen, doctor.

522
00:39:25,814 --> 00:39:28,490
Oh, I write down all that you say

523
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,092
to think about it afterwards.

524
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,319
You don't worry, do you?

525
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,585
It's exactly what I said.

526
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,086
Yes.

527
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,387
Lily...

528
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,757
I'm not proud of it, but...

529
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:48,719
I'm afraid from time to time I've had to
give a woman a good slap, you know.

530
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,805
It helps to clear
the air, doesn't it?

531
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,224
Me, I could never hit a woman.

532
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,453
In olden times a Blackfoot
could beat his wife

533
00:39:57,454 --> 00:39:59,521
and cut off her nose.

534
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,191
Granted, that's pretty violent.

535
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:07,877
- He could also beat his sister, right?
- Yes.

536
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,867
What kind of woman was
a man not allowed to beat?

537
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:16,497
My mother's first husband
was Chief White Calf.

538
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,624
But they had no children.

539
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,335
I read that White Calf
was a great chief!

540
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,963
Then he died and my
mother married my father.

541
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:29,676
My sister also had a
first husband who died.

542
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,362
They had no children either.

543
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,140
What about your ex-wife?

544
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,475
Lily?

545
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,644
She was sterile.

546
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,945
Oh rubbish!

547
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,106
Well I think she was.

548
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,607
Lily said that she
didn't want children.

549
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,862
No one uses it, except during parties.

550
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,739
I don't know if it is in tune.

551
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,867
The day of the partition of Palestine

552
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,287
Jokl was beating away
at it like a madman.

553
00:40:58,783 --> 00:41:03,343
Oh uh.  The administration
received a telegram.  It's for you.

554
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,003
Please read it.

555
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,105
It's Madeleine.

556
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,850
That's great!

557
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,012
"Believe it or not I'll be
in Topeka in three days."

558
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,016
- Do you know how the war went for her?
- Tough!

559
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,227
She was stuck in
Paris with her husband.

560
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:23,347
Ligez Lukasz must have
spent three years in the cellar.

561
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,024
Her family?

562
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,609
Madeleine is Christian.

563
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,445
And her family stays in Sheffield.
They won't even change.

564
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:34,366
You know, I never dared to ask you...

565
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,909
about your mom and dad.

566
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,911
Anyone deported?

567
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,873
It's easy to hide in Romania.

568
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,641
I will tune it.

569
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:57,890
Focus again.

570
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,108
Better or worse?

571
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,018
- Better.
- Oh, good.

572
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,901
So, we're making him some glasses?

573
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,569
Indeed we are.

574
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,489
Are you happy?

575
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,200
Yes, thank you.

576
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,476
All is well with Mr. Devereux?

577
00:42:19,577 --> 00:42:21,077
Yes, ah...

578
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,629
He's feeling much better.

579
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,542
Good!

580
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,744
I wouldn't have missed
this, for the world.

581
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,398
I brought your English saddle.

582
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,953
It weighs a ton!

583
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,455
Thank you a million!

584
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,629
Is this car yours?

585
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:13,014
Classy, ain't it?

586
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,134
How's the big city without me?

587
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,472
All your friends love me!

588
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,695
It's... Spartan!

589
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,198
Well, I'm going to teach
some Indian anthropology.

590
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,741
Menninger promised me.

591
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,043
It's for you.

592
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,220
I don't like surprises.

593
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,316
Doctor Freud...

594
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,486
Tell me now, what the
hell are you doing here?

595
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,989
I was curious to see your new place.

596
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,290
Why?

597
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,327
I'm not going to tell you.

598
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,948
Oh, I'll book a nice
hotel room in Topeka.

599
00:44:27,949 --> 00:44:29,216
It's too late!

600
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,919
Everyone in the hospital
knows that a "friend" is visiting.

601
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,431
Menninger even opened up
a bungalow just for you.

602
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,802
Good evening.
A welcome treat.

603
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,306
Compliments of Winter Hospital.

604
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,068
Gorgeous!

605
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,608
Come closer.
I want to kiss you.

606
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,164
Your Indian?

607
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,117
It's a secret, madam.

608
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,836
Looks like a plan.

609
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,297
You wrote all this?

610
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,008
My... what else do you
want me to to do here?

611
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,345
They just give me one session a day.

612
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,097
So after I'm back here,

613
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:29,059
I pace through and through in my
bed, like a criminal on probation.

614
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,811
Yes, I start to write.

615
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,438
You don't remember everything?

616
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,899
Every single line.

617
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,893
I have all his words
going in my head.

618
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,098
I was worried about your eyes.

619
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:45,659
To tell you the ophthalmologist
wasn't very optimistic.

620
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,828
My vision keeps getting worse.

621
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:51,873
For once, not to be, I couldn't read.

622
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,127
Do you see me?

623
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,586
Blurry?  Double?

624
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,047
Triple.
I see you very well.

625
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,042
We are at the end of the world.

626
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:12,686
No, this is not the end of the world.

627
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,312
It is.

628
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,837
What?

629
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,818
And we're lost.

630
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:04,096
- Good morning.
- It's nice how empty it is on Sunday.

631
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:11,434
To what church do you belong to?

632
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,039
I don't belong to any church.

633
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,288
You don't believe in God?

634
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:20,795
I just believe in doing good.

635
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,291
I want to send some
money to my daughter.

636
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,719
She wrote me.

637
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:33,058
She's pretty mad at me because
I haven't written to her lately.

638
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,644
That's Mary Lou.

639
00:47:41,676 --> 00:47:43,985
Well, it's a very tender letter.

640
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:52,077
I had a strange dream last night.

641
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:56,714
But when I woke up
I couldn't remember a thing.

642
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,417
Could you close your eyes?

643
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,086
Tell me the first thing you visualize.

644
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,131
You.

645
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,116
Did you dream of me?

646
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,922
We were out hunting.

647
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,268
I had a gun.

648
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,236
You didn't.

649
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,656
And then...

650
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,575
I saw a bear.

651
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,160
And my gun jammed.

652
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:32,243
And then the bear started chasing us.

653
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,244
And I kept jerking the lever

654
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,454
and nothing happened.

655
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:39,800
And... you told me

656
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:42,886
to put in one bullet at a time.

657
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,224
And I did that.

658
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,970
And then I was in another dream.

659
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,514
Now we hunted foxes.

660
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,060
I had a rifle, a 22

661
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,895
and you had none.

662
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,163
I shot the fox.

663
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,092
And I picked it up.

664
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:27,722
And you were talking to me.

665
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:29,966
And then...

666
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,102
A live baby?

667
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,773
He was either dead or asleep.

668
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,383
After that I woke up in a sweat.

669
00:49:47,543 --> 00:49:49,444
I didn't know a dream.

670
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,577
I'm just like the animal headed
person of the ancient braves.

671
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,750
Their protection gave courage.

672
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,571
Old timers say they used
to dream of a beaver.

673
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,375
And the Beaver gave them
advice and blessed them.

674
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,378
Then they would pray to the beaver.

675
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:10,820
And now you see why you started
today by talking about religion.

676
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:15,290
Dreaming of me was like
dreaming of a spirit head.

677
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,809
Were you scared when the gun jammed?

678
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,478
No, I wasn't.

679
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:28,024
In dreams, one tries to
tell something to oneself too.

680
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,402
What are you telling yourself?

681
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,889
You can't kill a bear,

682
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,826
but you can kill a fox,
in your dream.

683
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,544
Maybe the dream says we

684
00:50:41,545 --> 00:50:44,774
ought to start with
your little troubles first.

685
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,712
That's a good interpretation.

686
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:52,173
In the first dream,
what kind of bear was it?

687
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,427
- A brown bear.
- Male or female?

688
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:57,929
I don't know.

689
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,808
And the child it was naked.
Boy or a girl?

690
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,561
The child didn't look hurt, and

691
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,646
it had no bullet hole in it.

692
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,273
Make a guess.

693
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,192
A girl, maybe.

694
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:14,404
And who is this baby girl?

695
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:17,949
First it was a fox.

696
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,035
And then when I looked down,

697
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,079
it was a baby girl.

698
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,540
Foxes are hairy.

699
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,418
When do baby come out
to something hairy?

700
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,464
Out of a woman?

701
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,675
What happened afterwards?

702
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,003
I let her down.

703
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:44,525
What does this mean, let down?

704
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,921
That I have done wrong.

705
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,942
But you couldn't help it.  You were
so young. You were under pressure.

706
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,437
Maybe you did wrong
with your daughter,

707
00:51:55,438 --> 00:51:57,889
and let her down.
But you couldn't help it.

708
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,850
Come on, you were only 17,
you had nothing.

709
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,953
Today, you're good with your
daughter and you support her.

710
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,130
That's what matters.

711
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,754
I almost have $500 in the bank.

712
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:17,408
But I can't take a penny out
unless someone else signs for it.

713
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,777
I have to go downtown tomorrow.

714
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:22,430
I can take you to
the post office, if you like.

715
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,166
That's very nice.

716
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,354
<i> "The central theme of this session</i>

717
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,358
<i>was the aggressive
element in sexual behavior.</i>

718
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,594
<i>It is interesting to note
that the patient denied</i>

719
00:52:36,595 --> 00:52:39,864
<i> that the baby was dead
because it had no hole in it.</i>

720
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:43,368
<i>This remark further underscored</i>

721
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,870
<i>patient's castration anxiety</i>

722
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,248
<i>and his tendency to define women</i>

723
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:50,783
<i> as blind or dead."</i>

724
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,800
Where on earth did
you meet such a guy?

725
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,262
It's silly.

726
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:05,890
My husband first met George
in a waiting room in Paris.

727
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:09,293
They worked for
the same psychoanalyst.

728
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:15,416
I was working at the
Musée de l'Homme (Museum of Man).

729
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,222
Do you know how many women
Georges officially married?

730
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,526
Two, just two.

731
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:31,048
What are they possibly talking about?

732
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,159
I have no idea.

733
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,294
I like France.
I like the people there.

734
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,689
Why?

735
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,977
Farmers, ranchers.
My kind of people.

736
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,647
Did you ever visit Paris?

737
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,283
Two days.

738
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,819
We were camped in...

739
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,954
Vincennes?

740
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:07,118
Did you have to kill anyone

741
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,794
in the war?

742
00:54:09,429 --> 00:54:10,729
No.

743
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:14,836
By the time I got to France,
the krauts had already left.

744
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:23,460
Why can't my friend receive
money without my signature?

745
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,219
I don't make the rules, sir.

746
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:36,350
I want like to send the money
order to Spokane, Washington.

747
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,858
Okay.
You have to file a form.

748
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,904
- Can you write?
- Yes.

749
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,455
Who taught you all these
things about dreams?

750
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,291
Some man taught me.

751
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:59,337
I paid him very little because
I had so little money.

752
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,381
Now I do what the Indians do.

753
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,641
When they're young,
they help the old.

754
00:55:03,642 --> 00:55:06,035
And when they get old,
somebody helps them.

755
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,172
Sometimes dreams come true.

756
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:12,976
Where I live, if you ever come,

757
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:16,229
suppose a man can't find his horses.

758
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:20,483
He pays an old man and the
old man goes to sleep and dream.

759
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:24,028
And the next day, he'll
find your horses for you.

760
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,198
What?  You never hear about
dreams that didn't come true.

761
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,660
I remember this
guy on the reservation.

762
00:55:31,346 --> 00:55:34,539
Hey! This guy was a funny one.

763
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,746
He told us he dreamt
that he could fly

764
00:55:36,747 --> 00:55:39,985
if he performed the
ceremony with a dance.

765
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:44,671
So one day, he tied a buffalo
rope to his arms and legs,

766
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,469
and we all walked to
the top of this sheer cliff.

767
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,763
And he did his medicine dance.

768
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,398
And then...

769
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,701
he jumped and...

770
00:55:57,296 --> 00:56:01,120
He broke every bone in his body.

771
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,554
I could talk about dreams all day.

772
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,798
<i>Gayle,</i>

773
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,800
<i>since I was 16</i>

774
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,261
<i>I've just disappointed you all.</i>

775
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,980
<i>But I can't feel ashamed.</i>

776
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:37,226
<i>Here, I feel both alone and peaceful.</i>

777
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,395
<i>My life became such a mess.</i>

778
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,274
<i>Everyday I see the French doctor.</i>

779
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,569
<i>He often asks me
to tell him my dreams.</i>

780
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:49,781
<i>I tell him about the past as well.</i>

781
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,574
<i>This morning,</i>

782
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:54,577
<i>I remember the accident
that led me to this hospital.</i>

783
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,198
<i>We were in the forest.</i>

784
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,875
<i>There were no German soldiers.</i>

785
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,960
<i>Just frozen corpses.</i>

786
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:09,425
There's one here
for you too, Greeney.

787
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,678
Alright Jimmy, I got
a present for you.

788
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,483
Got a nest somewhere.

789
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:21,896
<i>Everybody got letters
from their girlfriends.</i>

790
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,590
<i>Lily didn't write to me.</i>

791
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,861
<i>My letter was from Cousin Dale.</i>

792
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,364
<i>And he told me that Lily had a lover.</i>

793
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,292
<i>I couldn't get that
picture out of my head.</i>

794
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:47,505
<i>My wife, walking around Browning,</i>

795
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,966
<i>holding hands with another man.</i>

796
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:53,511
<i>I saw them at my kitchen table.</i>

797
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,929
<i>I saw them laughing at my bed.</i>

798
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:02,962
<i>Everybody was so tired and worn out.</i>

799
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,315
<i>I just remember how quiet it was.</i>

800
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,668
<i>When I woke up in the hospital,</i>

801
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,336
<i>I could not see.</i>

802
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,131
<i>A nurse was talking to me.</i>

803
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:31,766
<i>My ear was draining.</i>

804
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:34,302
<i>It was something
like fat and bloody.</i>

805
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,762
What do you think that was?

806
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,600
Well, it may be pus,
from your middle ear.

807
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,852
Probably from your accident.

808
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,013
Dr. Menninger says my head is fine.

809
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:51,769
I'd like you to do another
neurological exam.

810
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,323
You think there's something
still wrong with my head?

811
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,416
Oh no, I don't think so.

812
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:03,105
After dinner I was reading in my
room and the pain started again.

813
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:07,126
Were you wearing your new glasses?

814
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,444
No, I hate them.

815
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,713
Do you know anyone who wears glasses?

816
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:15,593
- You do!
- Listen...

817
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:18,500
I look squarely at
things with my glasses.

818
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,141
You seem to hesitate
to identify with me.

819
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,110
You're always asking me to remember

820
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:26,562
things that happened before the army.

821
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,648
But I never had a headache...

822
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,484
before my accident.

823
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,595
Maybe Dr. Menninger is wrong

824
00:59:34,596 --> 00:59:37,265
and there's a real
problem with my brain.

825
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:41,327
Mm hm, your headaches surely
had a physiological origin,

826
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,580
and since the war, they may
have become psychogenic.

827
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:47,691
Your body has healed.

828
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,294
But when your mind is in pain,

829
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,255
the headaches come back.

830
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,925
It feels pleasant to feel
I'm justly wrong too.

831
00:59:56,635 --> 01:00:00,296
But you must tear
yourself away from the past.

832
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,598
How long will you stay here?

833
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,951
I guess until my patient is cured.

834
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,853
Which means...

835
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,780
A month?

836
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:14,994
A year?

837
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,615
Ouch!

838
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:23,119
Oh, it's so good to have you here!

839
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:28,249
- Do you know what Jimmy's name is?
- No.

840
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,876
Ohonita-e-Puyopei.

841
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,138
It means:
"Everybody talks about him."

842
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,066
You have a hidden name too.

843
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,327
No, I don't hide anything.

844
01:00:39,328 --> 01:00:41,637
No, your name is György Dobó.

845
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,522
I changed names.

846
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,059
I don't believe it!

847
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,813
You didn't tell your patient
you're French, did you?

848
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:55,170
My place of birth has no
bearing on Jimmy's cure.

849
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,019
You lied.

850
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,231
He was supposed to be here at 5.

851
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:03,409
Well, if you went back
and get him away.

852
01:01:24,024 --> 01:01:27,636
- Sorry.
- Oh, this is my friend, Madeleine.

853
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:29,367
Un bon ami.
(A good friend)

854
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:33,736
- Jimmy has been to France.
- Enchanté. (Nice to meet you)

855
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:38,269
So, you like museums.

856
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:40,190
Yeah, um...

857
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,965
Admittance was free.

858
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:48,454
We're heading back to the hospital.
Can we offer you a ride?

859
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:55,797
You smoke?

860
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:08,889
Smoke.

861
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,505
I got secrets, cousin.

862
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:46,846
Tonight...

863
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,659
I'll be...

864
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,811
flying among the pine trees...

865
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,773
like fire!

866
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,362
You keep on crowning cousin.

867
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:07,729
Keep on crowning.

868
01:03:13,408 --> 01:03:15,458
- George?
- Oh God.

869
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,876
Lost in your thoughts?

870
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,838
Just loafing.
You know, free associating...

871
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,170
- Are you busy?
- Well...

872
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,258
Not at all.

873
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,331
You know this Blackfoot practice

874
01:03:28,332 --> 01:03:30,181
we call "Pisting"?

875
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:33,934
The husbands used to
pull the labia of their wives.

876
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,563
Some of the old ladies
had 3 inches long labia!

877
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,441
Alas, no one's playing
this game anymore.

878
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:41,742
That's a pity!

879
01:03:41,743 --> 01:03:44,904
Jimmy and I, both would
give anything to see just one.

880
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,679
- Can you imagine?
- No.

881
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,670
Listen...

882
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,243
You got a letter this morning.

883
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,496
From France.
Not a very nice letter.

884
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:57,500
A copy was sent to the American
Psychoanalytic Association.

885
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,878
They don't recommend
accepting you as an analyst.

886
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,882
If you went back to
France, could you work it out?

887
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,759
I don't even know.

888
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:11,146
Well, at least,

889
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,307
you have worked here.

890
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:14,892
One patient?

891
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,186
And take good care of him.

892
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,697
Don't be ashamed.

893
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,952
It is important that you
depend on me to access.

894
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,038
It is also important that you

895
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,874
understand it and fix it.

896
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,460
That is what cures you.

897
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,178
If only I knew...

898
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:50,502
Is there anything that
suggests childhood?

899
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:56,976
Well, there are things that happened

900
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,812
when I was real small...

901
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:04,024
that no one knows about.

902
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:07,236
There were two girls
that lived nearby.

903
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,090
They were sisters.

904
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:16,545
One of them was younger than me
and the other one was older.

905
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:21,784
We were playing on the ice

906
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:24,878
and the younger one fell.

907
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,176
I didn't help for I was so scared.

908
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,845
I ran away.

909
01:05:33,788 --> 01:05:35,389
She drowned.

910
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,683
How old were you then?

911
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:41,312
I was five or six...

912
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:43,722
before my father died.

913
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,228
It was bad.

914
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,203
The older sister...

915
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,624
of the girl that drowned...

916
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,193
she used to go and play in the shed.

917
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,371
And she would call me in.

918
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,422
Make me play with her vagina.

919
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,938
I didn't know what it was for.

920
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,107
How old was this girl?

921
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:23,920
She was about six years older than me.

922
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:27,121
Did you put it in?

923
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:31,088
No.

924
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,530
Just your hand?

925
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,774
I always wanted to leave.

926
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:42,456
But she would drag me back in
and forced me to do it again.

927
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:47,436
Then one day, my sister caught us.

928
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:52,841
She beat the living tar
out of me right there.

929
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,729
Filthy!
Filthy!

930
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,429
Then she told my mother.

931
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,431
But I lied.

932
01:07:00,792 --> 01:07:02,768
I never admitted it.

933
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,402
This first, you mentioned

934
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:14,071
the drowning and fear.

935
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,865
Then

936
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,264
sex and lie.

937
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,214
When you were a, be the

938
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,122
as a sniper, in the army.

939
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:26,685
Did you have a
telescope on your rifle?

940
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:28,711
Yes, I did.

941
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,549
Did you ever...

942
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:38,137
spy on anyone during your childhood?

943
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,223
Sex spying?

944
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,742
About a year after my father died,

945
01:07:50,168 --> 01:07:54,903
one day... I came home from school

946
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,325
and when I went in, I saw...

947
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,004
a woman...

948
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:17,509
My mother.

949
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,554
In bed with another man.

950
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:25,825
I don't know who the other man was.

951
01:08:26,586 --> 01:08:29,563
I left her and ran away.

952
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,821
I got to my sister's house.

953
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,248
She was married already.

954
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:45,037
I was never with
my mother ever since.

955
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,231
Gayle raised me up from then on.

956
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:53,128
Well, you were punished
for playing with the girl,

957
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,014
whose sister died.

958
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:59,760
But this man didn't get punished
for being with your mother,

959
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:02,071
when your father died.

960
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:09,002
I guess all my thoughts are mixed up.

961
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:24,368
The child saw himself naturally

962
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:28,191
replacing his dead
father in the parental bed.

963
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:33,577
But what a disappointment when he
finds his mother in someone else's arms.

964
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,629
"That's my place!"

965
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:40,133
The boy sees the lover's penis.

966
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:43,303
He can't stop looking at the fasciné.

967
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,815
I don't believe the little
boy desires that penis.

968
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:50,794
No, he's Hamlet.  He wishes
to take the place of the lover!

969
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:52,396
Congratulations!

970
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:56,525
So now, you should shift
to the passive technique.

971
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,627
Just stop interfering.

972
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:02,781
Jimmy will find his way
through the dark forest.

973
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,592
I'll see you tomorrow.

974
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,880
Atterré.

975
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,135
Busy?

976
01:10:16,832 --> 01:10:18,132
Come on!

977
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:20,194
Wait.

978
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,172
- Hurry up!
- Yup!

979
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,493
My husband wrote...

980
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:54,104
- Anything wrong?
- No.

981
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:04,226
Lukasz and his friends.

982
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,429
He is lost without me.

983
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,828
Last year I was sure he had
an affair with this blonde.

984
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,938
I don't blame him.

985
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,024
Around him I'm so happy.

986
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,978
With you, I'm light.

987
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,739
But in real life I'm heavy.

988
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,001
You don't seem so light to me.

989
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,209
He sent me this ticket.

990
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,787
Your husband is a great man.

991
01:11:40,788 --> 01:11:42,172
FIRST CLASS
The Queen Ann

992
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:45,300
The Queen Anne leaves
for France from New York

993
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,502
the first Friday of next month.

994
01:11:48,663 --> 01:11:51,585
Madeleine I'm never
go back to France.

995
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,853
<i>Let the stick decide...</i>

996
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:02,484
<i>Falls back toward me, and
I stay here, as I always do.</i>

997
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:05,862
<i>Falls forward toward you...</i>

998
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:10,742
<i>Well, that's the law.</i>

999
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,956
<i>Here it goes Ann.</i>

1000
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,299
<i>Well Ann, you win.</i>

1001
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,552
<i>It's in the law.</i>

1002
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,234
I have always been a
man who let a woman die.

1003
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:51,491
We talked about my
daughter's mother, right?

1004
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:57,041
Jane's family came to
Browning for the winter.

1005
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:02,930
When they started school,
they have charity balls,

1006
01:13:02,937 --> 01:13:06,184
card parties, anything
to raise money.

1007
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,052
<i>That night there was to be a dance.</i>

1008
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:14,060
<i>That same afternoon, Jane told
me she was gonna have a baby.</i>

1009
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,391
<i>She was two months along.</i>

1010
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,351
<i>It was our secret.</i>

1011
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,229
<i>She asked me to come to the dance.</i>

1012
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,523
<i>She was coming with her folks.</i>

1013
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,651
I need my best horse tonight.

1014
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,154
<i>I got on my good clothes</i>

1015
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,740
<i>...and told my sister
I was going to the ball.</i>

1016
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,487
Make us all proud.

1017
01:13:33,488 --> 01:13:34,788
Come on!

1018
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,424
<i>I looked across the room</i>

1019
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,052
<i>and saw Jane in the
back with her mother.</i>

1020
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:54,704
<i>She was pointing at me.</i>

1021
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,788
<i>I was in the doorway
and another girl said to me:</i>

1022
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:06,758
<i>"I'm sick.  I gotta go home..."</i>

1023
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,819
<i>"Can you take me back?"</i>

1024
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:12,739
<i>I said sure.</i>

1025
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:17,585
<i>I took the girl to the house,
I rode right back to the dance.</i>

1026
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:22,791
<i>As I tied up my horse
behind a round horn,</i>

1027
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,835
<i>I saw a man and a boy...</i>

1028
01:14:24,836 --> 01:14:26,136
<i>I mean...</i>

1029
01:14:26,137 --> 01:14:27,462
<i>a man and a girl</i>

1030
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,006
<i>along the trail coming
from behind the haystack.</i>

1031
01:14:30,491 --> 01:14:32,843
<i>At first, I paid no attention.</i>

1032
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,405
<i>But then I walked in</i>

1033
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,615
<i>and they were right behind me.</i>

1034
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:06,168
<i>My daughter's mother
with another boy.</i>

1035
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:10,254
<i>Then she came to me and started
talking about us having to marry.</i>

1036
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:12,930
Jimmy!  I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1037
01:15:12,931 --> 01:15:14,031
I had to go.

1038
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:17,437
This afternoon you said you would talk
about marriage.  My mother is waiting.

1039
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:21,224
I thought. "Why was she
behind the haystack?"

1040
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,478
I felt bad...

1041
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:29,399
<i>I said: "Tomorrow I have to help
my brother-in-law feed the sheep".</i>

1042
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,117
<i>And I went home.</i>

1043
01:15:31,118 --> 01:15:34,604
Fine, leave!
You can't dance anyway!

1044
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:47,183
<i>After that night, I ducked
every time I saw her in town.</i>

1045
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:01,181
<i>Then the school found out about Jane</i>

1046
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,149
<i>and they kicked me out.</i>

1047
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:10,417
When her family asked,
I refused to marry her.

1048
01:16:10,452 --> 01:16:11,999
We had a trial.

1049
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,361
The first time I met Jimmy,

1050
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,747
it was at my uncle's house.

1051
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,199
<i>They said the child was mine.</i>

1052
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,701
Our cousin Jack was visiting.

1053
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,586
It was a sunny day.

1054
01:16:23,955 --> 01:16:25,747
And he came to me.

1055
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:28,208
And we knew each other.

1056
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:30,085
Your Honor,

1057
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:33,538
my client comes from one of the
most respected families in the...

1058
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:36,132
<i>Well, I had this lawyer.
He must have been really good</i>

1059
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,184
<i>because he won.</i>

1060
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,804
He beat that case.

1061
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,466
I was free.

1062
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,759
But I felt like hell.

1063
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,729
Paternity has not been established.

1064
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:54,359
Therefore, in the case of
WhiteCloud versus Picard

1065
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,779
a suit of custody brought by

1066
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:02,033
the plaintiff Jane WhiteCloud,
the court finds the defendant.

1067
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,887
We say that James Picard is not
the father of the child to come.

1068
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:11,002
<i>After the trial, Jane still
asked me to marry her.</i>

1069
01:17:11,003 --> 01:17:14,103
I asking you to marry me.  And if you
change your mind and propose to me,

1070
01:17:14,104 --> 01:17:15,850
I want you to know, I will say yes.

1071
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,049
All I know is what
I saw at the dance.

1072
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,634
What did you see?

1073
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,612
You're just an idiot,
you're just a plain idiot.

1074
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:29,311
My mother turned on me,
called me many names.

1075
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,026
<i>Spring time came.</i>

1076
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,362
<i>Her family had to move on.</i>

1077
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:48,154
Later, I heard that
Jane had had a girl.

1078
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,207
A year later,

1079
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:55,253
I came across the guy who
was behind the haystack.

1080
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:56,921
His name was Allan.

1081
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:00,133
Jimmy, this is funny.

1082
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:02,977
I thought sure you and
Jane would get married.

1083
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,013
Remember the ball?

1084
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:09,069
I was with Jane when she saw
you go out with that other girl.

1085
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,610
Oh, she got mad.

1086
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,938
I tried to calm her down.

1087
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,648
She asked me to go outside.

1088
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,234
We were looking for you in the cold.

1089
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,237
She could have ripped you to shreds.

1090
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:24,574
Then there was the army...

1091
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:26,292
my accident...

1092
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,703
And my divorce with Lily.

1093
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:32,165
If Jane had not told her daughter,

1094
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,586
Mary Lou would have not
known I was her father.

1095
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,880
I'm begging with you,
please just slow down.

1096
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,927
<i>Then one day, we
saw each other again.</i>

1097
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:02,061
Hey soldier!  They said
you were back in town.

1098
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,030
<i>So many years...</i>

1099
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:08,326
<i>I was another man I guess,
but Jane still wanted me.</i>

1100
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,913
You've been
all over the world!

1101
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:15,257
- Is your husband here?
- No.

1102
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:18,128
He stayed in Spokane.

1103
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,463
He couldn't get off work.

1104
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:25,630
- Is that her?
- Yes.

1105
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,187
I named her Mary Lou.

1106
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,141
She has heard about you.

1107
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:34,794
<i>We were together all
that afternoon and night.</i>

1108
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,900
<i>I let her go.</i>

1109
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:46,656
<i>She told me she was just
having some gallstones removed.</i>

1110
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:49,659
Tomorrow I have to
go to the hospital.

1111
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,703
They're going to operate on me.

1112
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:55,415
I would rather have you there
beside me than my husband.

1113
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:58,418
That night I prayed
she would outlive me.

1114
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:03,590
I mean I drank a lot
back in those days.

1115
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:07,218
Thinking of my dying
made me peaceful.

1116
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:12,352
I was supposed to meet
Jane, after the operation.

1117
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,143
<i>So I grabbed some
money from the bank...</i>

1118
01:20:16,486 --> 01:20:21,173
<i>At the station there was this girl,
a friend of Jane I knew from school.</i>

1119
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,186
- What are you doing in town?
- I'm taking this dream liner

1120
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:25,787
to go see Jane.

1121
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:35,205
<i>I asked her why she was crying.</i>

1122
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,594
<i>She said that afternoon a telegram</i>

1123
01:20:37,595 --> 01:20:40,543
<i>had come that Jane had died.</i>

1124
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,629
I'm so sorry, Jimmy!

1125
01:20:43,989 --> 01:20:45,907
That's how it was...

1126
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,552
It was Tuesday.

1127
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:54,006
Jane must have died on a Sunday.

1128
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,351
They buried her there.

1129
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,899
How could someone die of gallstone?

1130
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,485
I don't know.

1131
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:12,408
That is the worst thing
I ever did in my life.

1132
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,246
I never robbed a bank,

1133
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:18,248
never killed anybody.

1134
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,338
She had written to me
before the operation.

1135
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:28,140
But I got the letter after she died.

1136
01:21:31,604 --> 01:21:33,096
My love,

1137
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:36,516
I wish I weren't married, so
I can marry you over and over.

1138
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,851
My heart belongs to you.

1139
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,771
You're the only man who ever counted.

1140
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,691
If anything happens to me,

1141
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,151
take care of our daughter.

1142
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,452
Jane.

1143
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:53,658
See you tomorrow.

1144
01:21:56,453 --> 01:22:00,487
My family wanted me to
marry a good Indian girl

1145
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:05,244
who doesn't sleep with
her first boy she meets.

1146
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,967
Gayle thought Jane was stupid.

1147
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,353
And Lily?

1148
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:18,474
Lily she was...

1149
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,730
Lily she made it work.

1150
01:22:24,632 --> 01:22:26,482
But she was slippery.

1151
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:37,043
How much longer do
I have to stay here?

1152
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:42,256
How long does it take
to prep runaway horses?

1153
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,334
No one could tell.

1154
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:49,130
Perhaps it is time for this
procedure we spoke of.

1155
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,634
And what exactly
will they do to me?

1156
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:56,527
- They'll blow air into your brain.
- How?

1157
01:22:56,562 --> 01:22:58,072
Through the spinal cord.

1158
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:02,808
They'll see if all the parts of your
brain are joined together properly.

1159
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,097
Has anyone died from it?

1160
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,899
None that I know of.

1161
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,713
We called you here

1162
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:13,798
to let you know that I was ill.

1163
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:17,243
Why is camping here
for if you are ill?

1164
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,787
Why not stay home?

1165
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:25,309
And what's the hanging
missionary for?

1166
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,604
We're almost through.

1167
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,232
If you look far,

1168
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:34,068
you'll see that there's still

1169
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,320
one acre left to skive.

1170
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,796
As soon as they're finish,

1171
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,590
they go home.

1172
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:04,807
I have to get back.
I have a curfew.

1173
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,896
Picard, you must move out!

1174
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,186
Everyone is leaving.

1175
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:52,822
How so?

1176
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:56,818
Jimmy is sad because
we will soon be parting.

1177
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,688
How do you know when analysis is over?

1178
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,375
There's are no rules.

1179
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:07,829
You put...

1180
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:09,130
the soul

1181
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,323
in the heart.

1182
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,919
The heart in the mind.

1183
01:26:16,572 --> 01:26:18,089
And mind...

1184
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:20,675
in the body.

1185
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,018
And the body...

1186
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,255
in the person.

1187
01:26:27,385 --> 01:26:28,685
Wah lah!

1188
01:26:36,433 --> 01:26:37,733
- Hello!
- Yes

1189
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:40,778
I'm just here to
check about my patient.

1190
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:43,415
We are still waiting for
the oxy-encephalogram

1191
01:26:43,416 --> 01:26:45,658
and he is starting to get anxious.

1192
01:26:45,859 --> 01:26:48,936
Well, I put it in my
report quite a while ago.

1193
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:52,698
I can't inject gas into the
spinal column of a drunk.

1194
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,502
Jimmy hasn't been drinking.

1195
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:57,803
Are you kidding...

1196
01:26:58,132 --> 01:26:59,432
Thank you.

1197
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:04,218
Your Indian went on a little
jaunt the other night.

1198
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,991
We had to pick him up,
carry him back to his room.

1199
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:10,391
You'd never make such
a fuss about a white man!

1200
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:12,435
This is a gross misconduct!

1201
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:15,563
I demand the oxy-encephalogram
for my patient.

1202
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,732
And I demand a radio as well!

1203
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:21,527
The Palace of Theseus

1204
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:23,321
<i> Go, Filostrato </ i></i>

1205
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:25,948
<i>Stir up the Athenian youth to marriages.</i>

1206
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,993
<i>Awake hurt and ...</i>

1207
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:32,246
Last night, I went to a show.

1208
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:35,365
Little people worked with fingers.

1209
01:27:41,774 --> 01:27:43,500
Every time an act was over...

1210
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:48,604
the bright lights came on and they
gave me a sharp pain in the head.

1211
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:53,017
Remember the rules.
Don't try to think, just let it happen.

1212
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:58,022
I can't think what it could be.

1213
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,690
It will come.

1214
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,009
Once you're able to stand it.

1215
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,747
It is possible that I saw something

1216
01:28:05,748 --> 01:28:07,990
that might have triggered the pain?

1217
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,284
It's possible.

1218
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,756
Well, that play made me mad!

1219
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:19,418
<i>How now Spirit!
With a wandering...</i>

1220
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:31,347
There were two guys
arguing over a woman.

1221
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,433
There was a fairy.

1222
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:37,278
There was a guy with a donkey head!

1223
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:44,151
Honestly, I didn't get a
damn thing about that play!

1224
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:47,943
It's rare that you don't
understand something?

1225
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:53,058
What did I see last night?

1226
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,501
Two men fighting over a woman.

1227
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:03,629
What does that mean?

1228
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,159
You know sometimes we
have scars on our body

1229
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,040
and we don't know where
they come from anymore.

1230
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:13,639
There are such scars in the mind too.

1231
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:19,987
It is twelve.
We should stop now.

1232
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,860
When I was looking at that show.

1233
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,912
There were the puppets.

1234
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:33,034
And there was the guy
who makes them move, right?

1235
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:36,078
Well, one of them stood crooked.

1236
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,539
Its legs were folded up.

1237
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:45,421
And I thought :

1238
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:48,632
<i>That's exactly what the doctor says.</i>

1239
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:52,219
I'm not standing on my own feet.

1240
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:59,310
If that little guy
used his own strength

1241
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:00,611
he'd be fine.

1242
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,856
I hated comparing
myself to the puppet.

1243
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,642
I was over-powered.

1244
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:10,738
Everything I do is wrong.

1245
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:14,617
As though the man above is to blame.

1246
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:17,578
You're a person of dignity and worth.

1247
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:20,289
No one is pulling your strings here.

1248
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:24,085
When we first talked,

1249
01:30:24,762 --> 01:30:27,254
why did you bring up religion?

1250
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:33,385
The way I recall it,
you asked about my religion.

1251
01:30:33,586 --> 01:30:36,736
No, no.
In one night, you turned me away

1252
01:30:36,737 --> 01:30:38,773
from all religions.

1253
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:42,303
Now, my mind is turned
away from all religions

1254
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,604
for the rest of my life.

1255
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:47,566
The only advice I ever gave you,

1256
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:50,160
was to be your own master.

1257
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,280
You know I was Catholic.

1258
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:56,659
There are lots of
Catholics in this country!

1259
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,794
Why you try to cut us down?

1260
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:04,333
You know I have
nothing against the Indians.

1261
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:08,498
So now you imagine I have
something against your church.

1262
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,255
I think you're wrong.

1263
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,683
Okay.

1264
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,387
Explain to me why I am wrong.

1265
01:31:17,281 --> 01:31:20,474
Well... when I first started out,

1266
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:23,427
I was as green as that ashtray.

1267
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:26,438
Then you quit talking to me

1268
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,067
and I had to figure
it out all by myself.

1269
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:33,829
Religions are courage
builders, right?

1270
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,699
Well, I know a guy back home.

1271
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,326
He doesn't believe in anything.

1272
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,412
Not in the Indian religion,

1273
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,831
not in the Christian religion.

1274
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:48,043
And he's the biggest
drunk that ever walked.

1275
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,171
And he's a thief.

1276
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:53,632
Well, he does without religion.

1277
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:57,911
And you're afraid of
becoming a thief or a drunk?

1278
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,434
I drink.

1279
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,696
But I'm not a drunk.

1280
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:10,649
You seem uncomfortable.

1281
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,427
You're not afraid of me?

1282
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:16,697
Not that I know of.

1283
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,950
I would have preferred,
liked it much better

1284
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,369
if you had told me about it...

1285
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:24,205
I mean, about

1286
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:27,441
your getting drunk the other night.

1287
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:30,669
I don't care about
your getting plastered.

1288
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,847
Why be afraid to tell me?

1289
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:37,551
Alcohol has nothing to do
with my headaches.

1290
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:47,302
Hell, maybe I'm just plain crazy...

1291
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:51,241
- You never were crazy.
- Okay.

1292
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,610
Then why am I in this ward?

1293
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,343
You know, on the reservation

1294
01:33:02,344 --> 01:33:06,163
we have an "Indian agent"
to tell us what to do.

1295
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,834
I have lived all my life
under that shit.

1296
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:15,506
Then I come here,
to the Winter Hospital,

1297
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:17,691
and it's even worse.

1298
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,464
I got to get away from all that.

1299
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:30,020
If a man keeps on taking these things,

1300
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,690
as time goes on,

1301
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:35,609
they pile up.

1302
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:39,522
And one day it gets to be too much.

1303
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:41,282
Like you said:

1304
01:33:42,226 --> 01:33:45,703
it pours out in the
weakest part of the body.

1305
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:48,213
It's like...

1306
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,125
pounding

1307
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,795
in one spot.

1308
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:58,132
And that spot would be my head.

1309
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:02,886
I'm glad you're longer
scared of criticizing me.

1310
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:05,188
I was waiting for this.

1311
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:09,000
The day after tomorrow at four?

1312
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:11,763
Whenever you want.

1313
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:15,032
I'm the one who's locked up here.

1314
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:31,165
Do you need some help?

1315
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,966
My dear...

1316
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:41,008
- Can I take it?
- Well, be my guest.

1317
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:46,513
I woke up drunk.

1318
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:50,384
I've been such a good
soldier up to now, haven't I?

1319
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:11,246
You will be a big hit on the boat.

1320
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,722
Doctor Devereux!

1321
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:33,185
My handsome Indian:

1322
01:35:35,205 --> 01:35:37,439
My fondest thoughts for you.

1323
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:40,984
I should say goodbye
more tenderly, but...

1324
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:45,406
I forgot which words to use.

1325
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:49,647
I'm abandoning you.

1326
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:53,372
You will soon be a learned doctor.

1327
01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:55,833
You'll find a good American wife.

1328
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:57,759
Go for the rich one.

1329
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,431
But never forget to
what extent I am the

1330
01:36:02,432 --> 01:36:04,449
most precious part of you.

1331
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:08,117
Never severe the delicate
thread that binds us.

1332
01:36:10,374 --> 01:36:13,851
We can never forget the
radiant love which was ours.

1333
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:18,605
Will you come and visit me one day...

1334
01:36:21,443 --> 01:36:23,861
What nonsense I'm writing here?

1335
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:28,365
You, crossing the
sea, just to see me.

1336
01:36:30,588 --> 01:36:31,888
Write to me!

1337
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,738
For the love of God,
write to me often.

1338
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:39,134
Madeleine.

1339
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,423
Yeah, if we find he's
in perfect health,

1340
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:46,175
I'll have to tell the BA.

1341
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:50,262
What Dr. Braatoy means is,
would your rather get well

1342
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:52,181
or keep your pension?

1343
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:54,391
Without the headaches,
I'm fine.

1344
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:55,692
Good!

1345
01:36:57,353 --> 01:37:00,272
As soon as the guy
hears that his pension is cut,

1346
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:01,982
troubles come back.

1347
01:37:02,692 --> 01:37:04,344
You're fit, Chief!

1348
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:09,239
Sir.

1349
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,657
My name is Jim.

1350
01:37:11,034 --> 01:37:13,093
You call me Jim, not Chief.

1351
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:24,505
Miss.  I was supposed to
get a check from accounting.

1352
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:27,216
Oh.  We have all
the time in the world.

1353
01:37:27,217 --> 01:37:31,178
Don't worry, son.  I'll take some
blood as soon as I have a second.

1354
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:35,557
They might be closing soon and  I'm
afraid they're not opened on Saturday.

1355
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:39,061
They're open Saturday
mornings, sure, I promise.

1356
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:41,647
I'll get my test and you'll
get your check tomorrow.

1357
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:43,941
You can paint the town red!

1358
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,044
Accounting Office Hours

1359
01:38:38,755 --> 01:38:40,255
Mister!

1360
01:38:40,911 --> 01:38:42,511
Are you sick?

1361
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,210
Mister, you want me to call a nurse?

1362
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:46,511
Oh Lord!

1363
01:38:47,322 --> 01:38:49,873
Well, it's the lungs not his heart.

1364
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:53,016
You think you can get up?

1365
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:56,597
I was half asleep
and the pain was big.

1366
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,686
It felt my heart was gonna stop.

1367
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,355
I didn't move an inch.

1368
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:08,442
Little by little the pain went away.

1369
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:13,530
Don't know what caused it.

1370
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:16,763
You don't have heart trouble.

1371
01:39:16,764 --> 01:39:18,368
I'm sure of that.

1372
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:25,520
Maybe it was the way
the doctor talked to me.

1373
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:33,675
What about this nurse?   You
told me something about her.

1374
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,970
You wanted to withdraw your money...

1375
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:43,935
Maybe the nurse doesn't know that
the place was closed on Saturdays.

1376
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:47,022
But she has been here
long enough to know.

1377
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:54,969
I thought it was maybe
a test or doctor's orders.

1378
01:39:56,599 --> 01:39:58,784
It wasn't doctor's orders.

1379
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,953
You just can't fight with a woman.

1380
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,756
Can you?

1381
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:08,493
Don't mix me up.

1382
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:11,171
It's not right to yell at women.

1383
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:14,925
But you yelled at me
for this religion thing.

1384
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:17,886
But you gave this nurse
the benefit of the doubt

1385
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:20,924
because she is a woman.

1386
01:40:22,009 --> 01:40:25,133
Umm, I swallowed my anger.

1387
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:30,273
Suppose two goddess
did the same bad thing.

1388
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:34,144
One is ugly, the other one is pretty.

1389
01:40:34,276 --> 01:40:36,486
What do you think of
more excuses were?

1390
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:39,449
Same for both.

1391
01:40:39,684 --> 01:40:43,120
I'm afraid, that for myself,
I would blame the ugly one.

1392
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,706
You are strange!

1393
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:47,841
The truth is,

1394
01:40:48,418 --> 01:40:51,002
that when I got to
the Accounting Office,

1395
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:52,629
I was mad.

1396
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:56,633
But the anger lasted only a few seconds.

1397
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:00,387
Yes, and then you fell apart.

1398
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:06,184
So this attack came on because
I'm afraid to hurt the nurse?

1399
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:09,057
Not with the front part of your mind.

1400
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:12,758
With the back of my mind.

1401
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:14,701
Two factors :

1402
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:17,821
The fear that you could hurt women...

1403
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,915
and the fear that
they could hurt you.

1404
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:23,493
Remember, to be angry is good.

1405
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,620
Relapses are good!

1406
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:28,506
Life will still happen to you.

1407
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,023
Later on if ever the
headache comes back,

1408
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,632
figure it out.

1409
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:37,507
I know myself better
than anyone else does.

1410
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:40,962
You taught me that.

1411
01:41:59,906 --> 01:42:01,490
Soldier Picard!

1412
01:42:02,934 --> 01:42:04,434
Well?

1413
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:08,203
Can we have the next dance?

1414
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,957
So you remembered my address?

1415
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:14,294
Well, I was walking around and...

1416
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:16,995
just like that, came back to me.

1417
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:20,509
Well, fancy that!

1418
01:42:25,765 --> 01:42:29,059
- Oh, that's nice.
- Hand made with my hands.

1419
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:33,965
I like you.
You're gentle,

1420
01:42:33,966 --> 01:42:35,524
you don't play tough!

1421
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:36,909
Don't bet on it, sweetheart.

1422
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,356
You don't seem that crazy to me.

1423
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:18,116
Nope.

1424
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:23,072
So, after you get
out of the bug-house,

1425
01:43:23,073 --> 01:43:24,484
you want to stay around?

1426
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:30,120
Maybe I'll head to Seattle.
There are lots of Indians up there.

1427
01:43:31,873 --> 01:43:35,003
- Work the shipyards.
- Shipyards?

1428
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:38,930
And tonight.
You gonna stay around?

1429
01:43:40,089 --> 01:43:41,489
No way, young lady.

1430
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,728
- Are you sure?
- Yup.

1431
01:43:45,163 --> 01:43:49,169
Well... it's taking him
quite a while to calm down.

1432
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:55,937
Mr. Picard.

1433
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:59,524
We are here to discuss the
results of your treatment.

1434
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:03,028
Jimmy, do you have any
thoughts you'd like to share with us?

1435
01:44:05,114 --> 01:44:06,772
I don't know what to say.

1436
01:44:07,436 --> 01:44:09,836
The symptoms originally
presented by the patient,

1437
01:44:09,837 --> 01:44:11,494
have probably vanished.

1438
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:14,305
Yes, and we're all happy to see

1439
01:44:14,306 --> 01:44:17,000
how much insight
Jimmy has gained.

1440
01:44:17,359 --> 01:44:19,618
At Mr. Devereux
request a neurosurgeon

1441
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:22,330
and I will perform one last procedure.

1442
01:44:23,132 --> 01:44:26,301
Hello Jim, if the oxy-encephalogram
goes without a hitch,

1443
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:29,304
you'll be on the train
home next Thursday.

1444
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:33,975
Fellows, if these
walls could only talk.

1445
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:36,277
You have both come a long way.

1446
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:39,272
And we had to dig down deep.

1447
01:44:39,653 --> 01:44:41,316
- Jimmy?
- Yes, sir...

1448
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:42,617
I've been thinking.

1449
01:44:42,618 --> 01:44:46,571
You seem to have learned
so much here at Winter.

1450
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:50,392
I think you'd make a
big psychiatric aide!

1451
01:44:50,393 --> 01:44:52,827
Would you consider
staying on with us?

1452
01:44:54,236 --> 01:44:55,536
Well, I...

1453
01:44:56,999 --> 01:44:59,247
I need to spend some
time at home, first.

1454
01:44:59,248 --> 01:45:02,132
Go on.  Sure.
Just keep it in mind.

1455
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:04,339
We are very proud.

1456
01:45:11,597 --> 01:45:15,350
I feel like all my
complexes have disappeared.

1457
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:16,810
"Complexes"?

1458
01:45:18,604 --> 01:45:20,939
Where did you pick up that word?

1459
01:45:21,099 --> 01:45:24,602
Oh, I think you said so.
Maybe Dr. Holt.

1460
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:27,195
No, I never use that word!

1461
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:29,447
I'm afraid of big word.

1462
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:32,906
Homely words bring things closer.

1463
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:38,159
Would it help to have a
name for what ailed you?

1464
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:41,843
Well, if there's no word,
you can make up one.

1465
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:44,319
Actually we have a word.

1466
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:49,751
"Psychic Trauma."

1467
01:45:49,786 --> 01:45:51,553
It's a Greek word.

1468
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:55,648
It just means:

1469
01:45:58,019 --> 01:45:59,519
"soul pain."

1470
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,282
My friend, your soul was in pain.

1471
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:10,405
You know, last week
I went downtown.

1472
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:14,075
And I met that girl.

1473
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,496
I figure I tried myself out.

1474
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:21,436
- Did you made love?
- Yes.

1475
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:25,514
- So, no trouble in the penis department?
- Oh, no.

1476
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,422
That's terrific.!

1477
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:30,759
Are you going to see this girl again?

1478
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,413
She's nice, she's a Pawnee.

1479
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,598
But I'd better stay away from her.

1480
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:31,629
I have the results.

1481
01:48:32,923 --> 01:48:36,270
You don't have a cholesteatoma.

1482
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:44,601
You are in perfect health.

1483
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:46,311
That's great.

1484
01:48:47,313 --> 01:48:48,613
Oh, that's great.

1485
01:48:53,194 --> 01:48:54,609
You seem sad.

1486
01:48:55,571 --> 01:48:57,908
I'm glad I met you.

1487
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:03,073
You kept your promises.
Thank you.

1488
01:49:05,623 --> 01:49:08,208
I am glad we got together.

1489
01:49:10,586 --> 01:49:12,879
What will you do when you get back?

1490
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,083
I will go see Mary Lou.

1491
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,386
You should come visit.

1492
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,556
We could go horseback riding.

1493
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:26,726
We got lakes at the top
of the mountains with...

1494
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:28,444
fish in it.

1495
01:49:28,938 --> 01:49:30,855
You would like the scenery.

1496
01:49:31,941 --> 01:49:34,742
I might just come one day.

1497
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,945
It would be a nice trip.

1498
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:43,868
My friend, remember your name.

1499
01:49:43,869 --> 01:49:45,703
Ohonita-he-Puyope.

1500
01:49:45,704 --> 01:49:48,074
"Everybody talks about him."

1501
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:53,628
Any one who's at peace with
himself is at peace with others.

1502
01:49:54,755 --> 01:49:57,131
You have a good memory, doctor.

1503
01:49:58,006 --> 01:49:59,306
Very good.

1504
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:09,560
We had a nice talk.

1505
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:14,949
Good evening.

1506
01:50:22,825 --> 01:50:24,409
Do you miss Madeleine?

1507
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:29,163
No.  She has her life in Paris.

1508
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:33,084
Topeka, was just sort of...

1509
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:35,128
delightful holiday.

1510
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:39,382
And Menninger has offered me tenure.

1511
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:40,758
I heard.

1512
01:50:41,644 --> 01:50:43,886
It's what I wanted.

1513
01:50:46,724 --> 01:50:48,766
You will miss your patient?

1514
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,360
Of course.

1515
01:50:52,938 --> 01:50:55,690
He didn't want to see you to the station.

1516
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,820
No.

1517
01:51:00,195 --> 01:51:01,946
Do you feel guilty?

1518
01:51:04,433 --> 01:51:05,933
Oh no.

1519
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:11,920
No, I don't feel guilty for America's
crimes against the Indians.

1520
01:51:12,374 --> 01:51:14,735
I'm only responsible to myself

1521
01:51:14,736 --> 01:51:17,045
for what I myself do.

1522
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:21,128
I rejected communion of the saints

1523
01:51:21,129 --> 01:51:23,584
as well as the communion of evil.

1524
01:51:24,845 --> 01:51:28,273
I didn't help Jimmy Picard
because he was an Indian,

1525
01:51:28,274 --> 01:51:31,809
but because it was in
my power to help him.

1526
01:51:32,853 --> 01:51:37,565
What happened between Jimmy
and myself concerns only us.

1527
01:51:38,442 --> 01:51:41,819
It was between two men of good will,

1528
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,738
looking for common ground.

1529
01:51:44,948 --> 01:51:47,241
Surely, we are different!

1530
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:51,037
All men rejoice differently.

1531
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:56,459
But still we should all sit down to

1532
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,002
the God's banquet.

1533
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,421
You're not looking at me.

1534
01:52:02,174 --> 01:52:03,858
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

1535
01:52:07,596 --> 01:52:09,343
- Are you angry?
- I didn't know...

1536
01:52:09,344 --> 01:52:11,544
if you would visit me one day.

1537
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:14,619
I've been missing you.

1538
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:20,650
You know, I wrote to your grandmother
and asked her about adopting you.

1539
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:22,944
Did you know that?

1540
01:52:23,779 --> 01:52:25,079
I knew.

1541
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:34,071
I thought about it for a long time.

1542
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:37,208
And I think it could be a good idea.

1543
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:43,131
So I came here to
talk it over with you.

1544
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:45,766
Okay.

1545
