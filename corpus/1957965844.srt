00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,880
Now ladies, if you're
listening, repeat this again:

1
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,300
I am strong I am strong.

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,260
I am beautiful I am beautiful

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,220
I am a woman I am a woman

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,579
I am a queen I am a queen.

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,960
Looks like we have
another caller on the air.

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,300
Hello. You're on the air with Diana.

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,319
Hey Diana. This is Lacretia

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,459
Well good day Lacretia. What do
you want to talk about today?

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,680
Look, Diana. So I'm in a relationship
with my boyfriend, T. Ray, right?

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,300
For like 3 weeks now.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,200
And he like told me this
morning that he wants space.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,860
Like what the hell is that?

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,779
I don't get it.
"Space?"

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,320
He didn't want no space
last night and I-

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
So what is it this time, Peter?

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,000
&lt;TV sounds&gt;

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,740
Why am I even here?

18
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,100
OK Look.

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
What?

20
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,600
Really?
So what happened this time?

21
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,680
You got fired, didn't you?
You know what?

22
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,100
I don't even care.
I don't even want to know.

23
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,360
You already know the answer to the
question. Don't ask me anything else then.

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,880
Are you serious right now?

25
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,479
I ain't got time for this.
You know... Peter..

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,440
You know, I'm really tired here.
I could use your help, you know?

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,000
What do you mean? You're tired of me? Do I
have to remind you who all this belongs to?

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
Who? Your Mama?

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,320
It's mine now.

30
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,220
You know what? I can't do this
no more Peter. You know I...

31
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,320
I'm just tired, OK?
I'm just tired.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,020
&lt;cell phone rings&gt;

33
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,140
Hey Sis, how you doing?

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,039
Hey Mae. I'm doing alright.

35
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,600
It don't sound like you're doing OK.
Are you sure you're alright?

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm good. I'm good.

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,320
You think you're gonna stop by later?

38
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,080
Of course I am, but I
gotta go check on Mama first.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,940
Please tell her hello for me.

40
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,120
I miss Mama so much.

41
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,440
I do to, Sis.
How are the boys?

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,520
Michael and James, they're with
their dad and that witch of his.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Um.

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,140
A.J. He's here with me today.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,620
You mean he's finally
paying them some attention?

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah. Right.

47
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,080
Mae?

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Yes, Sis?

49
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,940
I got some bad news from the Doctor today.

50
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,460
And what did he say?

51
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,700
OK Sis. You know, We gonna get
through this.. Just like before.

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,400
You know, and I'm gonna be there with you
every step of the way.

53
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,560
Mae.

54
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,520
Mae. But the Doctor said it's in my bones.

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Yes Sis.

56
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,620
I need a favor.

57
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,040
Mama, why are you crying?

58
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,060
Anything..

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,080
Mama's just... a little sad, that's all.

60
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,380
Why are you so sad?

61
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,400
I got a lot of things going on but...
but it's gonna be alright, OK?

62
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,860
Mama's gonna be OK.

63
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,600
I love you so much.

64
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,620
&lt;Car horn beeps&gt;

65
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,500
Mikey, wheres your dad?
And why are you guys out here walking?

66
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,420
Oh, hey Aunt Mae.
Aunt Mae, I'm so glad to see you!

67
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,980
Just get in the car.

68
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,740
I don't know why he's got you guys walking.
That good for nothing, son of a...

69
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,420
It's all good, Aunt Mae.
We don't need him. We got this.

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,880
Yeah! Ain't nobody gonna
run up on me, you know?

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,760
Look at these muscles!

72
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,780
&lt;laughter&gt;

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,799
Hi Aunt Mae!
Hey baby. How you doing?

74
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,440
How's Mama? Where's Mama?

75
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,780
She's in the room. She's sad.

76
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,640
I know baby, but it's gonna be OK.
I promise. OK?

77
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,200
My boys.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,500
My boys.

79
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,740
Look, the boys are gonna be just fine.

80
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
OK?

81
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,580
Look at them. They're gonna be fine.

82
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,360
What I need you to do..

83
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,080
You hear me?
Is get some rest.

84
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
OK?

85
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,220
You get some rest
and I'll see you.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Mae?

87
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
Yes Sis?

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,860
I need you to take care of my boys.

89
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,100
Promise me..
You will.

90
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,080
Sis, there's nothing to promise.

91
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
'Cause you're gonna be fine.

92
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,500
And I need you to
stop talking like that.

93
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,720
You're gonna get through this
You understand?

94
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
I don't know.

95
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,840
Look. You're gonna get through this...

96
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,900
and you're gonna see
the boys graduate...

97
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,020
and one day get married...

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
You're gonna get through this...

99
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,020
I promise you that I'm gonna be
here with you every step of the way.

100
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,480
We're gonna beat this Sharon, we are.

101
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,100
You're always so positive.
Yeah, but you're a fighter to.

102
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,460
That's why I know we're
gonna get through this.

103
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,880
I haven't even told the boys yet.

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
Look...

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,760
You get some rest.

106
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,560
And I'm gonna go and
check on the boys..

107
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,440
And get them ready for bed.

108
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020
Ok.

109
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:45,140
&lt;Television sounds&gt;

110
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,900
Aunt Mae, are you ok?

111
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,780
Yes baby, I'm fine.
I just have a little something in my eye.

112
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,636
Are you gonna watch my
favorite cartoon with me?

113
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,080
Of course I am. Have a seat.

114
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,700
Man, give me this.

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,039
What are you doing?
What you mean, man?

116
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Gimme it back!

117
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,839
Look boys!
Whatever, man!

118
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,280
Can't wait to get outta here
and get my own place!

119
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:22,200
&lt;A sad scene plays on the TV&gt;

120
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,000
Maybeline, I'm so sorry to
hear about Sharon again.

121
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,820
Just pray for her.
God's got this.

122
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Hi Ms Maybeline!

123
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,640
Good morning.

124
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,319
Girl, these cookies...!
You need to open you up a bakery!

125
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,080
Someday, maybe I will.

126
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,900
I heard about Sharon.
So sorry.

127
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,440
Thank you baby.

128
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,420
You know, Mae. I'm always praying.
I know it's tough.

129
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,060
How are the boys?

130
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,539
They don't know yet.

131
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,940
She doesn't want to tell 'em.

132
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,800
Just keep praying.

133
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,399
Let me guess. Fletcher's not here yet.

134
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
No.

135
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,640
I heard about Sharon.
I'm so sorry Ms Maybeline.

136
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,480
It's OK.

137
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,779
Can you approve the
Jernigans order for me, please?

138
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,220
I gave them to Fletcher three weeks ago.

139
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,840
And he still hasn't approved them.

140
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,679
All right. Just give them to me.

141
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,920
I'm gonna tell you something Ms Maybeline.

142
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,979
The day he gets fired -
and I KNOW it's coming...

143
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm gonna kick these heels
off, and we shopping girl!

144
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,540
I'm gonna be shoppin' with you!

145
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,600
Umm! Good job GIRL!

146
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
I'm not sayin' anything.

147
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,400
Still don't understand
why I keep doing his job.

148
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,400
It wouldn't bother me if he
didn't even show up today,

149
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,600
Hey...
Ummmmm

150
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,459
Hey!

151
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,920
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hold on.

152
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,600
He's gonna get what's
coming to him one day.

153
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,040
Hey baby.

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
I love you Mae.

155
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,200
I love you more, Sis.

156
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,840
But I'm gonna need you to get some rest.

157
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Cause I have a big day
planned for us tomorrow.

158
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,620
OK?

159
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
OK.

160
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,800
God, please take care of my boys.

161
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,360
Good night

162
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,520
OK guys. Come on! Come on!

163
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,080
Get this out of the way please!

164
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,920
Here you go. Got it? OK.

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,960
Ya'll have a good day, Alright?

166
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Good morning Ms Maybeline!

167
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,360
Hey Sandra. How you doing, baby?

168
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,120
Good!

169
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Y'all have a good day!

170
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,000
Good morning Sharon.
I got the kids off to school, OK?

171
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,280
Time for you to get up..

172
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,760
Cause we got a big day planned today.

173
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,680
So I need you to get up. OK?

174
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Wakey Wakey!

175
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,080
Such a beautiful day, too.

176
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Sharon.

177
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Wake up.

178
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,520
Jesus, Sharon, No!

179
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,520
NO! Sister! No! God!

180
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh God please, no, Sharon, wake up!

181
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Wake up!

182
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,960
Wake up Sister! Oh my God!

183
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,160
Mommy...
It's gonna be alright baby. I promise.

184
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,040
Is my Mommy in Heaven now?

185
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
Yes she is baby,
and she's looking down on us right now.

186
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,080
You know she's an angel, right?

187
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,440
She is?
Yes she is.

188
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,400
Let's go guys. OK?

189
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,920
It's just a little bruise.

190
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,320
I have plenty, see?

191
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
So Ms Wilson, how are the boys coping?

192
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,720
They're getting better.

193
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,760
I'm tired of this shit!

194
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,239
Mikey. This is Ms Porter,
the social worker.

195
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
She's here checking on things.

196
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,360
How you doing Michael?

197
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm sorry about that. Don't pay
him no mind. some days he's...

198
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,480
Some days are good. Some days are bad.

199
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm sorry. He's just having a hard time.

200
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,520
Don't be. I am confident with you and
the boys... they're gonna be just fine.

201
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm gonna make a recommendation to the
board, that you become their legal guardian.

202
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,400
And that they do not
have to go into foster care.

203
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,680
Thank you so much for that.

204
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,240
I was thinking about adoption anyway.

205
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Their Father's not a part of their life..

206
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,360
And I promised my Sister that I
would take very good care of them.

207
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,040
So thank you so much for that.

208
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,880
Listen, I will do my best.

209
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Thank you.

210
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
OK, so how's everybody doing today?

211
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,060
A.J.?

212
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,180
James, how 'bout you?

213
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,360
I guess.

214
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,420
So how'd you do on your algebra test today?

215
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
O.K.

216
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,320
Don't nobody care about your stupid test.

217
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,200
Shut up! You're mad cause
that dumb girl don't like you!

218
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,840
Man! Forget her! Stupid!
You don't know anything!

219
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,760
I hope you go to a foster home
where everybody pees the bed.

220
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
We're going to a foster home?

221
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,520
Who told you that? No
one's going to a foster home.

222
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,120
No one's taking you away from me.

223
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,320
Mikey!

224
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,800
Cup Cakes!

225
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,040
Yes! We're celebrating!

226
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Why?

227
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Family!

228
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,280
That's right.

229
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,160
Mikey, can you come back in
here so we can have desert please?

230
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
So umm.

231
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,720
Why was that lady here today?

232
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,199
We're in the system.

233
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,320
No one wants us.

234
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
That's not right.

235
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,280
She was just checking on you
boys to make sure you're OK.

236
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
That's all.

237
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,240
Sure.

238
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,160
When you guys finish eating,
wash up and get ready for bed.

239
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
O.K.?

240
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,840
I'm sorry Ms Wilson, but your Mother's house will
go into foreclosure within the next 30 days.

241
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,480
But Mister Healy

242
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,160
I just moved in here with the boys,
and we don't have anywhere else to go.

243
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,200
I understand, Ma'am, but..

244
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,120
Unless the bank receives
the entire balance of..

245
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,720
$27,549.49 by the 15th..

246
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
The home will go into foreclosure.

247
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,200
Mister Healey, that's in two weeks.
I just don't have that kind of money.

248
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,880
I really am sorry Ma'am.

249
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,759
Marisol, if I don't get
this money by the 15th

250
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,680
they're gonna start foreclosure procedures
and I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

251
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,079
Oh wow, Mae. This couldn't
have happened at a worse time.

252
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Tell me about it.

253
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,400
Have you tried taking out a loan?

254
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,200
That's the first thing I did,
but they wouldn't let me have one.

255
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,640
Oh Lord..

256
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,840
What about the boys?
Three of them, right?

257
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,800
Yes, and it's tough.
Mikey, he's getting worse.

258
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,560
I just don't know what's going on with him.

259
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,160
Where's the Father?

260
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,920
That's a good question.

261
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
That poor excuse of father

262
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,360
Listen Mae. I raised four boys on my own.

263
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,560
You WILL get through this.

264
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,440
Just pray for me, Marisol.
Just Pray.

265
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,640
I'm always praying.

Ms Wilson?
Yes, this is Ms Wilson.

269
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,120
Ms Wilson, this is principle Summers.
Michael has been very disruptive in class..

270
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,200
And fought another student.
He is in detention, Ma'am.

271
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,520
I'll be right there principal Summers.
Thank you.

272
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,880
What's wrong?

273
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,360
It's Mikey again.
He got caught fighting.

274
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,040
Could you cover for me?
I don't want to deal with Fletcher today.

275
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Go.

276
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Thank you.

277
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640

for has been denied.]

Are you serious?

282
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,480
Aunt May the permission slip is due
next week and we need you to sign.

283
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
OK Baby..

284
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,440

OK. OK. I'm at home.

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,040
Ms Wilson! Have a seat.

294
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,079
Fletcher, I assure you,
this wont happen again.

295
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,920
I sure hope not. Cause I was
really counting on you today.

296
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,880
I'm really sorry. I was trying to get
the kids ready for school and...

297
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,660
I would imagine that this
job is important to you.

298
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Yeah?

299
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,640
Yes sir, but you know, I have a lot
going on Mister Fletcher...

300
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,560
Ms Wilson.
Ms Wilson.

301
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,160
Whatever you have going on,
that's really not important to me.

302
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,320
What I need you to do is to not
bring those things to work.

303
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,280
&lt;knocking&gt;

304
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:10,040
Hey!

Some people believe that because

313
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,160
they hold a certain position,

314
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,760
that they can treat people with disrespect.

315
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,880
But I need this job.

316
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,280
And I might have to get a second one. I just
don't see where I'm getting this money.

317
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,400
I just don't wanna see me and
the boys out in the street, that's all.

supposed to be working?

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,920
Let's see. How do you say this in Spanish?

322
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,800
You trabajando? Work!!!

323
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,200
Get to it.

324
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
Traba hondo

325
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,880

And uh... your job
IS to pick up the phone.

331
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,320
A. J. has fallen sick and he's been
transferred to the Children's Hospital.

332
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,239
Oh my God! Oh my God! I have to go!

333
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,160
Mister Fletcher, I have to
leave. My Son's sick...

334
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,400
Ms Wilson. This is becoming a
bad habit of yours.

335
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,800
But sir, I have to go to the
hospital to check on him!

336
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,960
The doctors are more than
capable of taking care of him.

337
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,479
Sir, please, I promised my Sister I would..

338
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,360
No Ms Wilson. I do have some shipping
labels here. I can't find where they are.

339
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,080
And I would ask that Spanish lady but..

340
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,840
We both know she don't
speak English. Get it done!

341
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Thank you.

342
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,520
Today is good, Ms Wilson.

343
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,320
She speaks English very well Sir.
She's been here about 23 years now.

344
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,000
I think her name is Channey
or something. She has a nice...

345
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,920
Excuse me!

346
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,720

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,600
A.J. Did not have his
inhaler, and he needed it.

349
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Inhaler?

350
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Yes.

351
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,600
I don'r know if you were aware, but A.J.
is asthmatic

352
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,520
Yes. His Mother told me a while
back. I just forgot. I'm sorry.

353
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,520
Just in case of emergencies, like today, he
will need to have a rescue inhaler at school.

354
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,200
O.K. Got it.

355
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,760
I promise. I'll do better. I...

356
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,560
I know. Listen. I know you're trying.

357
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,359
But if our office... I mean...
I'm just telling you.

358
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,920
If our office receives
one more complaint...

359
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,440
about anything that concerns the boys..

360
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,400
Then I'm afraid they're going to try
to take away your guardianship.

361
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,400
No! They can't do that! No, can't take the
boys away from me. please, don't let them...

362
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,440
Maybeline, at that point, there'll be nothing
else I can do. It'l be out of my hands.

363
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,000
OK. I promise. I'll do better. OK?

364
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
I sure hope so.

365
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,320
Thank you so much!

366
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Mom.

367
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,480
No baby. It's Aunt Mae.
You scared me. Are you OK baby?

368
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,360
Can we go home now?

369
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,720
Sure baby, soon as we hear from the...

370
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,680
Hey buddy. How you doing today?

371
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
You doing OK?

372
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,919
Ms Wilson, is it?

373
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,600
Yes Sir.

374
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,960
How you doing today Ms Wilson?

375
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,120
I'm Doctor Palmer. Are you doing OK?

376
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,120
I'm doing good.

377
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,799
Awesome. A.J. You doing OK today?

378
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,920
Not feeling to good?

379
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,760
Well let me go a head and
check your vital signs, OK?

380
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,160
Let's see...

381
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,519
Looks good there.
Everything looks pretty good.

382
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,600
Let me just check your heart for ya.

383
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,800
Can I get ya to take a deep breath?

384
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,720
Awesome. One more.

385
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,640
Good deal. Now A.J. Ms Wilson.

386
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,520
Now my nurse has already administered
a couple of procedures for me..

387
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,000
They've given him a couple of nebulizers
to open up his airways.

388
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,199
Because he was having some difficulty breathing
however we have some prescriptions for you also.

389
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,359
Now with these prescriptions I'm asking
that you make sure to get these filled

390
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,480
because he's going to need one
for day and one also for night.

391
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
OK?

392
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,759
I'm also asking that
you keep an eye on A.J.

393
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,320
Because with this season being
so brutal for asthmatics..

394
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,280
Keep an good eye on A.J. OK?

395
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,720
Yeah, keep a good eye on him because..

396
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,420
Right now, with this season, anything
can trigger an asthma attack.

397
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
Yes Sir, thank you.

398
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,480
No problem. A.J. You be good OK?
You can go home, OK?

399
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
All right, you take care.

400
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,680
Thanks you Sir. All right, where
are your shoes, baby?

401
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,960
OK. We can go home. Come on.

402
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,040
Come on. Let's go home.

403
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Sharon.

404
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,160
I can't do this.

405
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,360
They almost took A.J. from me today.

406
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,120
I just can't do it.

407
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,440
Please God. You're gonna
have to help me with this one.

408
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
I just can't

409
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
I can't..

410
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,760
Aunt May did you sign my permission slip.
I have to turn it in today

411
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,640
Yes. Yes. I got it right here. Hold on.

412
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,400
I..I.. can't find it..

413
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,200
Did you get your slip?
My Mom already signed mine last night.

414
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,240
You know everybody has
turn it in the paper today, right?

415
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,600
Yeah, I know. I wish my Mom was here.
I could always count on her.

416
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,880
Good morning! Hey, you got your slip?
I got mine!

417
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,040
&lt;cell phone ringing&gt;

418
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,280
Wait, I found it!

419
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,080
A.J. Wait! Wait!

420
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,320
Oh My gosh! I am SO excited to see
the museum of natural science.

421
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
There is SO much to do!

422
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,760
Miss Sandra! Miss Sandra Stop!
It's Ms Wilson!

423
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,720
Here baby. Here. Thanks Auntie.
You're welcome baby.

424
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,400
Now kids. Have a good day.
Bye Sandra!

425
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,840
Bye Ms Maybeline.

426
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Hello?

427
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,060
Ms Wilson, you need to come
in to the office right away.

428
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,000
So what's the problem, sir?

429
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,160
Ms Wilson. We really need to
discuss this in person.

430
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,480
OK. Alright.

431
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,440
There's been an oversight with
the past due loan papers.

432
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,280
Because your Mother took out a
second mortgage on the home,

433
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,320
insufficient payments have been
made for the past six months.

434
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,200
Unless the entire balance due of $27,549.49

435
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,800
is received...

436
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,640
The house will go into foreclosure
four days from today.

437
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,920
But Mister Healey, that's Friday!

438
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

439
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,560
So, what am I suppsed to do now?

440
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,480
I don't know, but unless the
bank receives the entire balance due,

441
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,200
the house WILL go into foreclosure.

442
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,960
OK. So can they take a percentage or
something, just to slow the process down?

443
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Can we do that?

444
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,600
I don't think I can do that, Ma'am.

445
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,440
&lt;crying&gt;

446
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,160
Well look.

447
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,280
I'll tell you what we'll do.

448
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,480
I'll see what I can do to slow the process
down. Do you think you could come up with

449
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,200
a third of the balance by Friday at noon?

450
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,120
Yes sir. I can do that.

451
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,200
All right...

452
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,640
That would be $9,183.16

453
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,320
I'll see what I can do for you.

454
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,200
OK.

455
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,940
Thanks you sir.
Thank you so much.

456
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,260
Excuse you! Watch where you're going!

457
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,460
I'm sorry Ma'am, OK?

458
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,700
With your old azz!

459
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,380
Good morning!
Good morning!

460
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,000
Your total's $4

461
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,840
How are you today?

462
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm wonderful, and you?

463
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,340
I'm good?

464
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,220
Your total comes to 40
dollars and 12 cents.

465
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,420
I'm sorry, it declined.

466
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Wow.

467
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,160
Aunt Mae, can I get this?

468
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,660
Baby, I'm sorry. Maybe next time, OK?

469
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
Awww man!

470
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,060
Baby, could you give me some of that back?

471
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,940
Sure.

472
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,860
Could you try that for
me one more time please?

473
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Sure.

474
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,860
I'm sorry Ma'am, it declined again.

475
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Again?

476
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,040
My goodness this is...

477
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
I got this.

478
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,960
Thank you Ernest. I mean Pastor Taylor.

479
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,340
I appreciate it.

480
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
So how you been doing?

481
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,000
I've been doing fine... You know?

482
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,760
It's kinda tough, but I'm doing OK.

483
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,020
Haven't seen you at the
church in quite some time now.

484
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,240
I know. But we'll be coming
back soon... I promise.

485
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
OK.

486
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,200
Thanks you again.. so much!

487
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
You're welcome.

488
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,820
Thank you, Darlin'

489
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,740
You have a great day.

490
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,799
How are the boys?

491
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
The boys are doing fine.

492
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
I'll see you soon.

493
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,020
You have a great day.

494
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
How you doing?

495
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
Oh God.

496
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,720
I need your help.

497
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,480
What am I gonna do now?

498
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,580
Aunt Mae! Aunt Mae!
He says he's the police!

499
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,020
The po-what? Hello?

500
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
My Son, what?

501
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,740
Shop what?!

502
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,700
OK Officer. I'll be down there
to get him in a few minutes.

503
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,799
James, go get your Brother

504
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,320
and tell him we gotta go pick up Mikey, OK?

505
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,660
Is Mikey in trouble?

506
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,700
No! Not yet. But oooh!

507
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,980
Uh, James, Can you take your
Brother inside for me?

508
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,520
And where do you think you're going?

509
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,540
I was going in-

510
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,900
No Sir! You're not going
anywhere. We need to talk.

511
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,440
Talk about what?

512
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,000
You're not my Mom!

513
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:27,820
You! I'm gonna kill that boy.
Help me! I'm gonna kill him!

514
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,740
Did you just slam my car door?

515
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,380
Who you think you're talking to, young man?
How DARE you disrespect me like that?

516
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,500
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

517
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,020
Oh! So you think you're a man now, right?

518
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,839
Oh! If you ever

519
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,700
disrespect me again. After
all I've done for you!!

520
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,540
OH! He's gonna make me KILL HIM!

521
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,680
Oh Jesus. You're gonna
have to help me Jesus.

522
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,880
Sharon, Lady, you're gonna have to come
down here and help me with this one.

523
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,420
That Michael gonna make me kick his a-

524
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,100
Woooo! Jesus, help me
Father! Oh God. Um um um

525
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,440
OK.Gotta pull it together!

526
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,800
Woo. OK.

527
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:55,720
&lt;phone ringing&gt;

528
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,960
Who's that?

529
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,820
Nobody. Go back to sleep.

530
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,600
Sigh

531
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,880
&lt;Knocking&gt;

532
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,620
Oh my God. What are you doing here?

533
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,580
Are you serious? I'm raising your kids
cause you're a sorry ass Father!

534
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look you need to leave.

535
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,840
Your son was arrested last night.
Do you hear me?

536
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,920
I don't have any money to support them, so
what am I supposed to do, Don? What?

537
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,760
Look Maybeline. They're
not my problem right now.

538
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
You know what?

539
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,436
One of these days you're gonna get what you
deserve if you don't do right by those boys.

540
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,920
They need their Father, you know?

541
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,940
I can't deal with this right now.
I have a family to take care of.

542
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,240
So Michael, A.J. and James.
They're not yours?

543
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
Really?

544
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,980
You know, you're a poor excuse
for a man. You're a sorry ass man...

545
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,260
You know? You don't need them.
You don't deserve them. OK?

546
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,000
And what is this? Really? Really?

547
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,300
You must be joking! God!

548
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,940
Why are you here? I'm sorry,
Who are you? Hello?

549
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,020
Who is that? and why is she here?

550
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,180
Who is that? and why is she in our house?

551
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,060
What's this about?

552
00:38:53,340 --> 00:39:00,060
Ms. Wilson, this is a surprise! I wasn't
expecting to see you so soon.

553
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,620
You sound so dim on
the phone. Is everything OK?

554
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,920
Excuse me, waiter?

555
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,160
Good morning. Good morning.
Could I get a latte please?

556
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,560
I'm sorry madam, we don't sell Latte.

557
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,280
Could I have we a coffee?
Certainly madam.

558
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,560
Thank you You're welcome.

559
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,720
I've got some good news!

560
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,860
Look Ms Porter, I-

561
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,280
It's Jacqueline. Call me Jacqueline.

562
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,800
OK Jacqueline.Look.
I don't know if I can do this.

563
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,460
I think it's best if we can just
find them a more stable home.

564
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,420
What do you mean? Is everything OK?

565
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,440
I just think they need to be in a more
stable home. I can't provide that for them.

566
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Here we go.

567
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,960
Thank you.
You're welcome. Hope you enjoy.

568
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,040
You know... I can't provide that for them.

569
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,920
And just yesterday, I saw their Father.

570
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,260
I just don't understand why a man doesn't
want anything to do with his kids.

571
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,160
He don't even care about them.
You know...

572
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,880
I'm trying here.
I really am trying but...

573
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,420
Ms Wilson. Unfortunately, their
Father has no rights to the boys.

574
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,040
He never claimed paternity.

575
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,580
His name has never been
on their birth papers.

576
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,780
Ms Port-I mean Jacqueline,

577
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,620
I don't know what I'm doing wrong here.

578
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,820
Just last night I had to get
Michael out of jail for shoplifting.

579
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,900
And that Father.
That no good-

580
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840
He just has no regard for them.
I just don't under-

581
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,340
You know..
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

582
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,800
I don't even know what I'm
saying right now... It's just-

583
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,440
&lt;cell phone ringing&gt;

584
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Hello

585
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,020
No, He left with Sandra this morning.

586
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,660
Is everything OK? What's going on?

587
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh my God! I gotta go!
What-Where is he?

588
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,200
What;s going on? And where is who?

589
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,060
It's James. He's missing!

590
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,740
I'm going! And you can go with me.
My car's parked right outside.

591
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,140
OK. Ok.

592
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,020
Where do you think he is?

593
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,280
I have no idea. I have to call the police.

594
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,060
OK. Let's check the house first.
I'm sure he's OK.

595
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,400
What's your emergency?

596
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,400
It's my Son. My Son is missing.
Oh my God.

597
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,200
He's supposed to be at school
this morning but he never showed up.

598
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,080
Yes. He's wearing a purple shirt
and black slacks.

599
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,300
He's about 4 feet tall and-
wait! Wait! I think I see him!

600
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,080
Where?
Over there! Officer, we found him.

601
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,160
Thank you so much!
Oh my God.

602
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,140
Baby, why aren't you in school?

603
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,980
I'm sorry Aunt Mae.

604
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,436
I'm sorry Aunt Mae. I went to talk to
Mom about you and Michael.

605
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,220
But baby, why didn't you just
come to me? I don't know.

606
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,940
Are you gonna send us away?
Baby, you know I'd never do that.

607
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,880
I would never do that.

608
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,020
Hey James. Are you OK?

609
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,320
You had us both worried about you.
I'm sorry.

610
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,620
It's OK baby.
Let's go home.

611
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,260
Ms Wilson. I need to
talk to you for a moment.

612
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,040
OK. James, baby. Could you
go inside for a moment please?

613
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,780
Maybeline. You know I'm
gonna have to report this.

614
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,200
I don't want to.
But I'm gonna have to report this.

615
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,980
And I'm sorry.

616
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,400
I know. But I'm trying here
You know?

617
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,880
I just don't want to disappoint
my sister or these kids.

618
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,380
I know, and I completely understand.

619
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,440
Here I am. A young girl.
Got married at 25.

620
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,400
Had a husband who didn't
want to have any children.

621
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,300
But I wanted at least 3.
And so...

622
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,400
I find out that I'm pregnant
and I'm so excited.

623
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:30,640
Excited about having a baby.
And here he is. He's not excited with me.

624
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,160
So. 3 and a half months later..

625
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,120
He tried to kill me,
and I have a miscarriage.

626
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,560
I had no idea.
I am so so sorry.

627
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,520
And it's ok.
But what it reminds me of..

628
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:54,920
Is change. This happened nine years ago.
Today he would have been nine years old.

629
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,880
Wow. I'm so sorry.

630
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:04,040
Look Maybeline. Sometimes things happen.

631
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,680
And when those things happen,
they steer you in the right direction.

632
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,799
You know, when I think
about begin a social worker..

633
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,000
Children are really the main priority.
They're number one!

634
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:23,760
So my thought to you is, If you wanna have those
kids- if you want to raise them, raise them.

635
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,900
If you don't want them,
let somebody else raise them.

636
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,380
But those children deserve to be with you.
They WANT to be with you.

637
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,560
God I really need you right now.
I REALLY need you God, right now.

638
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,160
What a surprise.

639
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,740
God is-

640
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,899
&lt;laughter&gt; Well hello Ms Wilson.

641
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,580
Hey Pastor Taylor.
Thought you was God there for a minute.

642
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,100
So how are you doing?
I'm fine.

643
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,220
And the boys, how are they coping?

644
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,020
They're doing better.

645
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:19,579
You know, the other day at the store, you guys rushed
out so quickly, I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

646
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,880
Yeah, sorry about that.

647
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,939
But I really do appreciate what you did.

648
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,940
Think nothing about it.

649
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,820
It's just been tough, man. I'm just
taking it one day at a time.

650
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm sure.

651
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:36,120
You know, he never said this journey
we call life was gonna be an easy one.

652
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,920
It can be very tough.

653
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,460
Hey man. You coming?

654
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,900
Yeah man.

655
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,020
What? Your Mama let you out this time?
Aren't you suposed to be in bed?

656
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,620
Real funny

657
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,500
I'm trying to get outta here.

658
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,979
Sometimes I feel like I'm
losing it, you know? with these kids.

659
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,300
The bills... just everything.
It's just too much.

660
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,520
Hmm. Talk to me.

661
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,140
The bank is gonna foreclose
on my Mother's house...

662
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,020
and Michael, he's just all out of control. You
know, he got arrested a couple of days ago?

663
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:51,460
This whole life has just been so hard...
and James! James ran away.

664
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,620
It's just been too tough.
I thought I lost him.

665
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,080
You haven't lost him.

666
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,680
Hey, let' stalk about this "Pastor
Taylor" stuff. &lt;laughs&gt;

667
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,700
I think you and me are way
past the "Pastor" title.

668
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,359
You better be calling me Earnest.

669
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:21,940
OK Earnest. I just feel like I'm
way over my head here.

670
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:31,160
I'm the oldest. I'm supposed to have it all
together. But I don't... It's just tough.

671
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,100
You know, the last time you sang for us at the
church, it was you and your sister Sharon.

672
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,240
I remember. You sang that song..

673
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,960
"He is able." I never forgot that.

674
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,800
He IS able, you know?
Yeah, that was Mama's song.

675
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,619
She loved that song. You know, that time
when Sharon was in the hospital sick,

676
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,020
she said y'all, He is able!

677
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:07,060
And we all sang that song. Nurses came from
everywhere just to see what was going on.

678
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,040
I'm sure they did.
&lt;laughter&gt;

679
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,180
Your Mama, Dell, She was no joke.

680
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,620
&lt;laughs&gt;

681
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,636
All right boy, lets see
what you're made of.

682
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,020
I ain't got no money.

683
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,340
Money? Who said anything about money?

684
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,980
You're not scared now, are you?

685
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,480
Naw man. Just keep the engine running.

686
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,420
You know those apple pies your Mom made?

687
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,560
They were delicious. No wonder
my Mom and her were always..

688
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,980
In the kitchen at my house
eating those apple pies.

689
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,040
Maybe that's why I always had to
sneak a piece of them, you know?

690
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,880
I sure miss her a lot.

691
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,160
She always knew what to say.
She was a great lady.

692
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,560
How's Mother Taylor doing?
She's doing great.

693
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,480
My Mom's wide open.
She's got more energy than I do!

694
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,920
Would you give her my love please?

695
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,260
I'll do it. You know I will.

696
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,220
Gun! Drive! Drive! Drive!

697
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,920
Hey stop!
&lt;Gun shots&gt;

698
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:45,380
&lt; humming the song, "He is able" &gt;

699
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,200
Mae?
What's wrong?

700
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,960
&lt;cell phone ringing&gt;

701
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,160
Hello?

702
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,640
&lt;police sirens&gt;

703
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,360
&lt;crying&gt;

704
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,820
Doctor.

705
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,140
I'm sorry Ma'am. what patient name?

706
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
Michael. Michael Wilson.

707
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,460
Ms Wilson, we're doing everything
we can to save him. It is critical.

708
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,600
No!

709
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,460
We've recovered two of the bullets-

710
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,780
Ma'am, I'm so sorry. I have to go.

711
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,460
Nurse can you inform me
when Dr. Heisengburg is free?

712
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,280
Maybeline?

713
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,040
Listen. I am so sorry about poor Michael.

714
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,240
And everything that you're going through
right now. Just pray for us please.

715
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,640
Can we have a seat for a moment?

716
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,120
Maybeline, I have even more bad news.

717
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,560
What can be worse than
this Jacqueline? What?

718
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,760
The State has decided to take the boys.

719
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,840
They can't do that!
No! I'm not having that!

720
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,420
Maybeline, you don't understand.

721
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,580
Look. I heard you.

722
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,200
But you need to listen to me.
They're not taking my kids away!

723
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,420
They're not doing that.

724
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,680
Maybeline, I have my orders
Really?

725
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,260
You came down here to tell me
you're taking my kids away after-

726
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,780
That young man's in there
fighting for his life!

727
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,540
And you come to take my kids away!?
No, I'm not having that!

728
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
Hey Ms Wilson.
Can I speak to you privately?

729
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,160
Ms Wilson. I'm so sorry.

730
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,320
But there's no brain activity.
I'm afraid he wont pull through.

731
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,780
So what are you saying Doctor?

732
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,439
What are you saying?

733
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,180
I'm afraid he wont pull through.

734
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,720
You may need to consider
removing him from life-support.

735
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,220
I wish I had better news for you Ma'am.

736
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,120
How old are you, Doctor?

737
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,339
Doctor Sharpe, was it?

738
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:55,940
Yes Ma'am

739
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,400
Thirty? Thirty five?

740
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,200
Do you have kids?
Do you have kids?

741
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,700
No Ma'am. I understand
this is a tough time for you.

742
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:11,640
You don't understand anything.
That boy in there is fighting for his life!

743
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,220
And you're telling me to take him off life support?
Just let him die? Is that what you're saying to me?

744
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,740
Is that what you're saying?

745
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,240
No ma'am. Listen. I know
this is a tough time for you.

746
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,440
That's correct.
You've done all you can do.

747
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,520
But my God...
He's bigger than this!

748
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,680
Please excuse me ma'am

749
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,680
I told you not to marry that fool!
You just wait until I see him!

750
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:50,100
Mama I don't know what I'm gonna do!
He's took everything from me!

751
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,100
And left me with $250,000 in debt!

752
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,520
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

753
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,640
He didn't take everything from you!
He didn't take everything from you!

754
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,500
He didn't take God!
You still got God!

755
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:07,400
What did I tell you and your Sister?
I always taught you how to call on him!

756
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,780
He is your everything!
He is your healer! He is your provider!

757
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,940
Call on him! You know his name!
Jehovah! Call on God! Call on him!

758
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,620
I'm not taking him off life support.
I just can't do it.

759
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,320
Earnest, I'm gonna need you
to pray right now.

760
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,040
Mae.

761
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,840
I've been paying this whole time.

762
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,220
I've got the prayer warriors at
church on this. God's in control.

763
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,400
Keep the faith, Mae.

764
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,660
I know God is bigger than this.

765
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,580
I need your keys right now.

766
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,640
I need your keys.

767
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,039
Let me take you somewhere.

768
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,640
No, I don't need you to take me nowhere.

769
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,820
I just need your keys right now.

770
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,720
Maybeline!

771
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,720
Look Jackie!
I just need you to to-

772
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,400
Chill out!

773
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,999
I can't! I can't!

774
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,560
I can't deal with you right now!
Where you going?

775
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,620
I'm going to do what my
Mother taught me to do!

776
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,560
I'm going to call him up!
Do you understand hat?

777
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,679
I can't deal with this right now!

778
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,180
Mae, let me-

779
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,500
go with you. Where-

780
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,820
Where are you?

781
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,100
Who are you?

782
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,660
My Mother said to call on
you when I was in trouble!

783
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,820
And I'm calling you right now!

784
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,360
Michael needs you!

785
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,620
Please save him!
Please!

786
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,320
My mama said you are Jehovah!

787
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
And..

788
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,240
That you heal! That you answer prayers!

789
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,600
Answer me! Heal Michael right now! Jesus!

790
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,980
Heal him fast.

791
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,200
God, please! Do you hear me?

792
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,560
Do you hear me?

793
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,420
God

794
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,300
I need you to heal right now, Jesus

795
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,640
I need you to provide right now Jesus!

796
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,120
Deliver me, Jesus!

797
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,600
I'm calling on you!

798
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,360
I'm calling on you!
In my Mother's name, Jesus!

799
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,880
You're the only God that she talked about!

800
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,420
Please don't fail me now.

801
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,700
Maybeline! Mae!

802
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,760
&lt;crying&gt;

803
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,300
Mae, are you OK?

804
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,960
I can't take him off life support.
I can't let him die.

805
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,760
Mae, I don't know how to
tell you this right now...

806
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,160
but Ms Porter has taken the boys.

807
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:40,520
I reasoned with her the best I could But she had
her orders. There was nothing else I could do.

808
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,400
Listen Mae.
Don't lose the faith.

809
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,220
Do you remember when my Mom was sick?
She almost died.

810
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,620
God brought her through.
Look at her now.

811
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,300
He can do the same for Michael.

812
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,480
You know, Mae

813
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,340
sometimes you gotta let go, and let God

814
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,620
Mama used to preach that to us.

815
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,040
I'm sure she did.

816
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,520
I swear! I can hear her now!

817
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,520
Girl, yes! She was adamant about that!

818
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,880
I am so glad you got away from that man.

819
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,780
Let him have it... It's not worth it.

820
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:40,040
Besides, it's good to have you around
again. I Missed you, you know that?

821
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:55,340
Wake up Michael, please. Wake up.
It's Aunt Mae. I'm here baby.

822
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:05,780
Mae. I've go to to run to the church and check
on a few things, OK? I'll be back shortly.

823
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,840
Let me pick you something
to eat while I'm gone though.

824
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,020
I don't want anything to eat.

825
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,600
You've gotta keep up your strength Mae.

826
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,940
OK? I'll be back shortly, OK?

827
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,220
Dear God please let my Michael be OK.

828
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,060
Please. Oh my God.

829
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,760
Oh. Ms Wilson

830
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,960
Please tell me he's gonna be OK

831
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,820
Ma'am I'm Doctor Heisenberg.

832
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,620
I'm sorry. Your Son's
condition has not changed.

833
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,980
We've done all we can do.

834
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,140
No! The Devil is a liar!
Oh my God!

835
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,880
Michael. Michael. Oh my God. Michael!

836
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,760
It's Aunt Mae, baby. Michael!

837
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,280
He moved. Jesus, thank you, God!

838
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
Doctor!

839
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Doctor

840
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,880
Come on Michael. Squeeze my hand.

841
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,240
Doctor!

842
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,760
Ms Wilson. What's going on?

843
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,840
He moved!

844
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,720
He moved.

845
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,560
I'm sorry ma'am. He's unresponsive.

846
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,400
I see know sign of brain activity.

847
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,360
He moved, I tell you! I felt him. He moved!

848
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,520
We've done-We're DOING all we can.

849
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,300
You know what Doctor?
Just leave me alone here cause-

850
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,180
You Doctors don't see anything. Just leave!

851
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,120
I'll be back to check on him.

852
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,940
Mae, when did he move?

853
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,880
Just now. He just moved!

854
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,940
Those Doctors. They don't know anything.
My baby's gonna be just fine.

855
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,800
Mae you've GOT to get some rest.
I'm not tired!

856
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,420
You're here 24 hours a day.
You've barely eaten.

857
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,480
I'll stay here with Michael and if anything
changes, I'll call you immediately.

858
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,640
Please Mae. Go get some rest.

859
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,560
OK. But you gotta promise you'll
call if anything happens.

860
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,600
I will call you if anything changes.

861
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,560
How can you be strong for Michael when
you've run yourself down this low?

862
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,520
Get some rest and get some food in you, OK?

863
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,920

to call you yesterday, I am so sorry. Can we meet?

869
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,040

01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,120
Can we discuss in-person please?

871
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,720
Okay, where? I'm on my way
to the hospital right now.

872
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,680

873
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,480
Alright. I'm coming.

874
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,359
You know I'm trying here. Where are they?

875
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,520
Any progress on Michael?

876
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,040
A.J. and James.
Where are they!

877
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,160
The boys are with me.

878
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,320
I couldn't let the state take them.

879
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,520
Oh my God. Thank you so much.

880
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,960
Maybeline. I've got you covered.

881
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,080
Don't even worry about it.
I've been in this profession for a while,

882
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,920
so I know a few things.

883
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,560
Thank you so much, Jacqueline.

884
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,760
You're welcome.

885
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,440
The boys are doing just fine.

886
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,680
You have a hearing next Tuesday. We just
need to make sure that you're their.

887
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,800
The judge is actually
going to make a decision.

888
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,320
And we need to make sure that you can
prove that you have a stable home to go to.

889
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,679
And they're going to ask you about Michael.

890
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,840
Michael?
Yes.

891
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,680
Michael. Any progress You know?

892
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,560
He's in a coma still.

893
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,320
I swear to you I felt him move last night.

894
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,999
Really? Yeah, but them Doctors.
They don't believe me.

895
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,400
He's in a coma... but...

896
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,400
Maybe it's all in my head. I don't know.

897
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,640
I'm just hoping so much.. you know?

898
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,360
But I'm NOT taking him off no life support.
I'm just NOT doing that!

899
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,920
Mae!

900
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,680
Any word yet?

901
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,480
No. Nothing yet. But I just keep on praying

902
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,080
Thank you.

903
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,440
Did you get you some rest.

904
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,640
&lt;cell phone ringing&gt;

905
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,960
It didn't get much rest though.
Thinking about Michael all night

906
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,640
What's wrong?

907
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,040
It's the bank man. I can't right now...

908
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,600
Mae?

909
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,840
I can't!

910
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,720
&lt;cell phone ringing&gt;

911
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,000
Do you realize what this means?

912
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,440
Yeah, but...

913
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,880
My only concern is with him.
I can't lose him. I just can't.

914
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:37,040
I know. I know.
But if there is one thing that I DO know..

915
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,360
If there is a God..
And I know that there is one...

916
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,840
that he has to intervene into
this situation right now.

917
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,000
I'm gonna go and just check on the boys.

918
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,160
Thank you

919
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,640
You know Mae, I wish I had
made better choices in life.

920
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,400
But then I look a
this beautiful baby boy.

921
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,920
I can't believe that God blessed
me with such a beautiful baby.

922
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:17,720
Oh my goodness! Adorable too!
Auntie is going to spoil him rotten.

923
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,080
Oh my gosh.

924
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:23,239
And you know Mikey?
Just know..

925
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,920
That I'm going to be here for you always
No matter what!

926
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,000
OK? &lt;laughter&gt;

927
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,080
Hey baby boy

928
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,000
I promise I'm gonna be here
for you no matter what. OK?

929
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,360
It's OK Mae.

930
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,740
He's with me now.

931
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,220
You can let him go.

932
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,160
Sharon, I'm so sorry.

933
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,700
It's OK

934
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,440
I'm so sorry.

935
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,880
It's OK

936
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,620
Doctor!
Doctor!

937
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:30,260
Ms Wilson. Michael is not improving.
I'm so sorry, Ma'am.

938
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,460
Ms Wilson.
Ms Wilson.

939
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,440
The only thing that's keeping his
heart beating is this machine.

940
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,140
Here are the papers.
Just sign whenever you're ready.

941
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,160
&lt;Crying&gt;

942
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,780
Can I have a moment with him please?

943
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,840
Of course.

944
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:00,200
&lt;Crying&gt;

945
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,360
Mae, I wish I could do more.
You know that I-

946
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,580
Just a moment alone with him please!

947
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,420
Could you just go and get
A.J. and James for me?

948
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,720
I'll take care of the boys, OK?

949
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,080
I love you so much.

950
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,740
&lt;knocking&gt;

951
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,460
Ms Wilson!

952
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,940
&lt;Knocking&gt;

953
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,800
Ms Wilson.
It's Edward Healy from the bank, Ma'am!

954
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,920
Mister Healy. What do you want?

955
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,700
I am so glad I caught you at home.
I need you to sign...

956
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,559
here, here, here, and initial here.

957
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,720
Sign what? You people have
already taken everything from me.

958
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,600
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

959
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,800
Look I grew up in this house.
Now it's all gone, thanks to you.

960
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,460
There must be some confusion. I just came
by to remove the house from foreclosure.

961
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,380
I called last night to say I was coming...
Left a message. Did you not get it?

962
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:14,320
No. What are you saying to me Mister Healy?
What are you saying?

963
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,340
Yesterday afternoon, someone came by
the bank and paid the entire balance.

964
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,600
Oh my God!

965
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,100
Oh my God!

966
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,340
You didn't know, did you?

967
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,340
No what!?

968
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,820
I had no idea. Oh my God!

969
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,040
I would not joke with you
about a thing like that.

970
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,240
Yesterday afternoon,
as I was closing up,

971
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,520
an elderly lady came into the bank.

972
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,660
She looked familiar. I think
I know her from someplace.

973
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:45,080
Anyway, she came in and put the
full balance on my desk. $27,549.49

974
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,420
It was the strangest thing I ever seen.
She didn't speak much.

975
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,980
She just had the biggest, brightest smile.

976
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,360
She said "Put this on the
account of Adel Wilson."

977
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:02,400
Well this is unbelievable! Oh my God!
God is SO good! Thank you SO much!

978
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,980
I wonder if she's single. Hmmm

979
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,479
Miss Maybeline! How you doing?

980
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,720
I'm doing fine.

981
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,560
I heard about what happened.
I am so so sorry.

982
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,540
Thank you.

983
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,780
Are you doing OK? I'm doing fine.

984
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,719
Let me know if you need anything, OK?

985
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,720
OK.

986
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,080
Guess who got fired.
Who?

987
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:41,600
Who?

988
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,600
Black Jesus!

989
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,600
Black Jesus?

990
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,540
Come on now.

991
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,080
Ooooo Black Jesus!

992
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,080
Talk to you later, alright?

993
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,300
OK Fine.

994
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,160
Have a seat Ms Wilson.

995
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,280
What a surprise.

996
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,320
You know I haven't seen
you in quite some time.

997
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,080
I heard about your kid getting shot.

998
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,400
My condolence... whatever.

999
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,400
You know, Ms Wilson.

1000
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,740
I promised myself that I would never become like
one of those brothers out there on the streets.

1001
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,860
I blame the parent.
I think if the parent was good,

1002
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,120
the kids wont be on the street.

1003
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,000
I mean. Look at me.
I'm 32.

1004
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,200
Can you believe that?

1005
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,520
Mister Fletcher was there
something that you needed?

1006
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,220
Cause I need to go back to
work and get caught up.

1007
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:44,900
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
I have your end of year review.

1008
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,860
I thought Mister Jackson said-

1009
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:47,940
Yeah. He's busy

1010
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,720
He's busy. I have it done.

1011
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,340
You know, Ms Wilson?

1012
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,080
I need you on your 'A' game.

1013
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,980
Your performance, and you attendance.

1014
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,680
Very very poor.

1015
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,140
What?

1016
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,120
Yep. Very poor.

1017
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,620
Miss Maybeline.

1018
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,220
You, and that Spanish one out there...

1019
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,700
You two..

1020
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:24,300
Are two of the laziest
old people I've ever met!

1021
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,240
If it was up to me, you'd
both be fired today.

1022
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:36,080
Listen.. little boy.
Yeah, I said little boy.

1023
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,340
You need to watch your mouth.

1024
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:44,620
Excuse me. Little boy? I think you're
completely out of line Miss Maybeline.

1025
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:49,480
What? You see.
You're trying to take me there.

1026
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:55,160
You think you can just come up in here
and treat me like a child?

1027
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,960
You know. we know your
Daddy got you this job.

1028
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,200
Yeah. We know that.
And you're rude!

1029
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,000
And you're out of line!

1030
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,980
I think you owe us both an apology.

1031
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:12,160
Matter of fact, I think you owe
ALL of us an apology!

1032
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,480
An apology?

1033
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,140
Yes. Apology!
Do you think I am stupid?

1034
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:24,640
You know I know everything. And I do mean
EVERYTHING that goes on in this office!

1035
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,180
And I'll be damned if I won't report you!

1036
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,480
Miss Maybeline-

1037
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,440
Keith! I thought you weren't
coming in till tomorrow.

1038
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:40,820
But did you hear this insubordination?
I'm so surprise-

1039
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,480
Hello Miss Maybeline. How are you today?

1040
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:51,400
I heard about your Son.
I am so... so very sorry.

1041
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,900
Is there anything I can do?

1042
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,420
Did you not just hear what this lady-

1043
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,880
I heard, Fletcher.

1044
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:04,440
You know, Maybeline? My Mom
asks about you every single day.

1045
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,980
She even came by looking
for you a few days ago.

1046
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,500
And.. We've been very worried.
I'm so sorry.

1047
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,120
Thank you Mister Jackson.

1048
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,740
It's been a long few weeks.
And a tough one as well.

1049
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,100
But God...

1050
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,900
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him.

1051
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,760
I'm still here.

1052
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:32,080
Yes Ma'am. I'm so very sorry.

1053
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,340
Why don't I walk you on back to your desk.

1054
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,520
Thank you.

1055
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,020
And Fletcher.

1056
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,560
Yes Keith.

1057
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,420
Why don't you apologize to Ms Wilson?

1058
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,880
Apolo-? Do it now!

1059
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,320
Yes, I'm sorry Ms Wilson.

1060
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,839
Oh umm, Fletcher.

1061
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,720
Yes sir?

1062
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,760
You're fired.

1063
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,360
What?!

1064
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,040
Clear out your things immediately!

1065
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,900
Are you serious?

1066
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:14,680
You know?

1067
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,060
The job is yours if you want it.

1068
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,800
Hey!

1069
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,380
How you feeling?

1070
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,760
I'm doing better.

1071
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,340
Some days are good.
Come on in.

1072
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,260
I poured you some wine.

1073
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,040
Oh great. Thank you.

1074
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,440
I heard you've been looking for me.

1075
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:53,260
Oh yeah. Where's Ernie?

1076
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:58,000
I'm not sure, but Mister Jackson said you
stopped by a few times looking for me.

1077
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,440
How are the boys?

1078
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,720
The boys are doing just-

1079
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,420
Adell?

1080
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,860
Oh, it's so great to see you!

1081
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,420
Everybody's dong just fine.

1082
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,440
Oh good! good.

1083
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,640
I've got something for you.

1084
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:21,400
I want you to have this..
Before I forget everything.

1085
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:23,340
No. You wont.

1086
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:27,000
But but it's already starting to happen.

1087
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,740
This is me and Adell.

1088
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:38,920
She was my best friend.

1089
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,220
My Mom was your best friend? Really?

1090
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:46,980
I remember the first day she walked into
Bulah middle school. She was so shy.

1091
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,120
Wow.

1092
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,300
Oh my God.

1093
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,060
This is a picture of Sharon and me.

1094
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,740
Is that so?

1095
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,940
She just had the biggest, brightest smile.

1096
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,640
&lt;door bell rings&gt;

1097
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,420
Hey Auntie!

1098
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,019
Hey baby. How you doing?
Hey guys, how's it going?

1099
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,040
Hey old man!

1100
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:56,440
Old man!?
Thanks a lot!

1101
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,000
Hey.

1102
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,120
Hey Auntie.

1103
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,320
So you know I'm about to graduate, right?

1104
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,540
So can I get a graduation party?
What you think?

1105
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,380
You paying me?

1106
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,059
Am I paying you?

1107
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,060
Yeah!

1108
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,380
I'm a college student. I ain't
got no money! Come on now!

1109
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,100
We'll see.

1110
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,640
What's going on?

1111
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,440
Look. You know I got a big order tomorrow.

1112
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,380
I'm gonna need all hands on deck.
You understand me?

1113
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,900
Yes! Ma'am!

1114
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,560
All right guys. You heard her.
James, come help me move the truck!

1115
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,080
Guess I'm driving again.

1116
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,520
I don't think so!

1117
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:37,580
You know Earnest can't drive.

1118
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,080
I can drive very well, thank you!

1119
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,020
Who told you that?

1120
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,100
Look,

1121
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:44,720
James!

1122
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,660
Whatever you do, do NOT
let him get to the car first!

1123
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,540
&lt;Doorbell rings&gt;

1124
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,396

Amen?

1131
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:12,340

&lt;applause&gt;

1133
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,339
I'd like to start off this morning
with a scripture from...

1134
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,700
It's so good to see you.

You too.
Thank you darling.

This is my Daughter, Jasmine.

Oh hey Jasmine, how you doing?

Now to him that is able to do exceedingly,
abundantly above all that we ask, or think..

One church.
And one body.

01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:08,600
In my Farther's church..
When I was a small child about this tall...

1154
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,820
being in the children's choir,

1155
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,920
and singing that wonderful song,

1156
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,120
He is able.

1157
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,340
&lt;Amen&gt;

1158
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:21,780
If I could have my wife come forward
and lead us in this wonderful song..

01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:28,160

The first male to attempt this surgery will
be giving birth about 12 noon, tomorrow.

1162
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:42,140
He will be the first male to give birth and we will
have this recorded as the breakthrough for everyone.

1163
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:45,140
It will be a breakthrough for..

Take 1 A

1167
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,160
&lt;Laughter&gt;
Exactly what happened at your last job?

1168
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:01,560
Umm, Some old folks wouldn't do their
job and management blamed it on me and...

1169
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:02,800
I got fired.

1170
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,440
Fired! Whoop whoop!

Will you willingly...?

1175
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,860
Was this your idea to be the first
man to attempt this procedure?

1176
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,959
No. I'm being forced.

1177
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,719
&lt;laughter&gt;
It's against my will.

1178
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,220
Help!

01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,460
No, he is not being forced.
