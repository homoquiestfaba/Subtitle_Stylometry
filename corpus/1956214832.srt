(BREATHES HEAVILY)

1051
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:38,986
What's good?

1052
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:41,086
Just maintaining, man.
Long time no see, what's up?

1053
01:09:41,088 --> 01:09:46,785
Nothing, man. Just been caught up.
You know, the house, the baby.

1054
01:09:46,787 --> 01:09:47,919
You know how it is.

1055
01:09:47,921 --> 01:09:50,019
Yeah? How Bianca doing?

1056
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:52,919
She's good. She's good.

1057
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:56,019
Good, good, good.

1058
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:59,452
Listen, man, I've been meaning
to hit you up, though.

1059
01:09:59,454 --> 01:10:02,485
Commissioner wanna know
who we plan to fight next.

1060
01:10:02,487 --> 01:10:04,552
You ain't gotta fight Drago,

1061
01:10:04,554 --> 01:10:07,118
but you gotta fight someone.

1062
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,885
You gotta defend the belt.

1063
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:12,087
Otherwise,
it's gonna be vacated.

1064
01:10:14,354 --> 01:10:17,887
I could set up a little, you
know, tune-up fight, kind of.

1065
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:25,985
No. You know what, man?

1066
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:27,052
Don't worry about
none of that right now.

1067
01:10:27,054 --> 01:10:29,652
Listen, just come on inside.

1068
01:10:29,654 --> 01:10:31,820
Hit the bag, man, warm up.

1069
01:10:32,654 --> 01:10:34,585
Yeah.

1070
01:10:34,587 --> 01:10:37,320
Yeah, I'm gonna grab my stuff,
and I'm gonna meet you in there.

1071
01:10:39,853 --> 01:10:41,520
All right, man.

1072
01:10:51,454 --> 01:10:53,585
Put your body weight
into that glove.

1073
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:55,454
There you go. Lean in it.

1074
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,853
ROCKY: Yeah, I called you,
like, a thousand times.

1075
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,886
Yeah, it's about the light.

1076
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,184
How long?

1077
01:11:15,186 --> 01:11:17,684
You want to be specific?
Couple years.

1078
01:11:17,686 --> 01:11:19,417
Yeah.

1079
01:11:19,419 --> 01:11:21,920
I mean, how many guys does it
take to screw in a light bulb?

1080
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,253
I'm not joking.

1081
01:11:26,885 --> 01:11:29,117
Can I call you guys back?

1082
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:30,286
Yeah.

1083
01:11:38,286 --> 01:11:39,286
(MUMBLES)

1084
01:11:45,586 --> 01:11:46,785

(SIGHS)

1086
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,118
Hey, Ma.

1087
01:12:13,118 --> 01:12:14,252
Ma.

1088
01:12:27,784 --> 01:12:29,018
Hey, Ma.

1089
01:12:32,751 --> 01:12:34,185
How you doing, kid?

1090
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:37,450
What are you doing here?

1091
01:12:37,452 --> 01:12:39,316
I hope you don't mind,

1092
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:42,452
your mom asked if I would come out
'cause she's worried about you.

1093
01:12:45,418 --> 01:12:47,117
I am, too.

1094
01:12:47,552 --> 01:12:49,050
I'm good.

1095
01:12:51,318 --> 01:12:53,216
You didn't have to come
all this way.

1096
01:12:53,218 --> 01:12:55,015
By train.

1097
01:12:55,017 --> 01:12:58,583
(CHUCKLES) Three days
on a train.

1098
01:12:58,585 --> 01:13:00,948
It's all right, you know,
gives you time to think.

1099
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:05,749
And you watch all these places
whipping by the windows like postcards.

1100
01:13:05,751 --> 01:13:07,717
It's quite an experience.

1101
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:09,982
Yeah, I mean, if you say so.

1102
01:13:09,984 --> 01:13:11,851
Yeah, it was nice.

1103
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:14,415
This is wonderful.

1104
01:13:14,417 --> 01:13:17,984
How you have
all this out here.

1105
01:13:18,851 --> 01:13:21,650
You could have the same.

1106
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:23,382
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

1107
01:13:23,384 --> 01:13:26,882
I mean,
not just the shiny stuff,

1108
01:13:26,884 --> 01:13:28,451
but the better stuff.

1109
01:13:30,584 --> 01:13:32,017
Have a better life.

1110
01:13:35,618 --> 01:13:37,384
Be a better man.

1111
01:13:39,484 --> 01:13:42,947
You know, I was thinking about
what you were saying about

1112
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:46,817
what smart decisions
have I made lately.

1113
01:13:50,084 --> 01:13:52,251
Couldn't think of many.

1114
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:58,116
You know, I wasn't even there
when my son's son,

1115
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:01,384
my grandson,

1116
01:14:02,183 --> 01:14:04,181
was born.

1117
01:14:04,183 --> 01:14:08,515
I mean, he's like
that tall now probably.

1118
01:14:08,517 --> 01:14:11,451
I don't even know him.
He doesn't know me.

1119
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:16,450
It's pathetic.

1120
01:14:17,718 --> 01:14:19,483
Well, why won't you just

1121
01:14:20,949 --> 01:14:23,147
call him?

1122
01:14:23,149 --> 01:14:25,516
It ain't that easy,
you know...

1123
01:14:28,116 --> 01:14:29,414
Listen,

1124
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:33,514
I don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.

1125
01:14:33,516 --> 01:14:35,283
You know what I mean?

1126
01:14:37,983 --> 01:14:40,116
So, you gotta ask yourself,

1127
01:14:40,949 --> 01:14:43,681
what's the valuable stuff?

1128
01:14:43,683 --> 01:14:46,715
It's like I asked you before.

1129
01:14:46,717 --> 01:14:49,383
What were you
really fighting for?

1130
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,083
I was afraid.

1131
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:57,881
Of this.

1132
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,848
Expectations.

1133
01:15:03,683 --> 01:15:05,250
Being the champ.

1134
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,848
I was scared I couldn't do
what he couldn't.

1135
01:15:13,215 --> 01:15:14,483
It's weird.

1136
01:15:16,815 --> 01:15:19,182
I used to feel like
he was apart of me.

1137
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:23,380
Now I can't hear him,
or that thing,

1138
01:15:23,382 --> 01:15:26,413
that thing that tells me
to get in the ring.

1139
01:15:26,415 --> 01:15:28,946
Move my feet,
keep my hands up.

1140
01:15:28,948 --> 01:15:31,282
Hit anything
that gets in my way.

1141
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:37,482
I can't hear it anymore.

1142
01:15:45,282 --> 01:15:47,680
I don't even know how I lost.

1143
01:15:47,682 --> 01:15:49,847
Your mind wasn't right.

1144
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:56,182
And your natural style just
won't work with a guy that big.

1145
01:16:04,582 --> 01:16:06,449
You saying yours was better?

1146
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:09,182
I won, didn't I?

1147
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:12,014
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1148
01:16:16,014 --> 01:16:19,246
- Good seeing you, Unc.
- Great to see you, too.

1149
01:16:19,248 --> 01:16:21,079
I was talking
with your mother,

1150
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:26,547
and she says you came up
with this name for the child.

1151
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:27,812
- Amara.
- Amara.

1152
01:16:27,814 --> 01:16:29,045
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1153
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:30,713
Why, what's wrong with that?

1154
01:16:30,715 --> 01:16:33,212
No, it's a beautiful name,
but it's kind of complicated.

1155
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,912
Why don't you think
about something,

1156
01:16:34,914 --> 01:16:37,112
at least I would,
a little simpler to say,

1157
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:40,579
like "Becky" or "Cate,"
something like that.

1158
01:16:40,581 --> 01:16:41,979
Cate Creed?

1159
01:16:41,981 --> 01:16:43,812
Cate Creed. Two "C's."
Easy to remember.

1160
01:16:43,814 --> 01:16:45,812
You do know
she's gonna be black, right?

1161
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:47,812

- Yeah.

1165

for her, okay? That's your job.

- Yeah.

of your life. Right here.

No, never mind.
Just get in here.

01:17:29,381 --> 01:17:30,579
Okay. Okay, okay.

1179
01:17:30,581 --> 01:17:33,046
Like I said,
I'll be here if you need me.

- All right.
- All right.

You know,
I'm gonna do what I can.

1182
01:17:43,313 --> 01:17:46,645

is more than enough.

feel anything?

No, it's painless. I promise.

1207
01:19:48,645 --> 01:19:50,477
Okay. Now that
they're in place,

1208
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:53,443
what we're gonna do is give
her a series of click stimuli

1209
01:19:53,445 --> 01:19:54,875
around 35 decibels

1210
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:57,243
and check her
neural responses.

1211
01:19:57,245 --> 01:19:58,809
Is that loud?

1212
01:19:58,811 --> 01:20:00,478

are we looking for?

I'm not sure how
this is supposed to go. Um...

1750
01:58:59,707 --> 01:59:03,072
I guess I should tell you that
Mom's doing pretty good.

01:59:43,507 --> 01:59:45,106
That I did it.

1761
01:59:48,773 --> 01:59:51,006
But I didn't do it for you.

1762
01:59:54,439 --> 01:59:56,073

have to do it all on our own.</i>
