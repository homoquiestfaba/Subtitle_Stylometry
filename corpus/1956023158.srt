00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,709
I love this belt.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,265
Only 30 minutes more TV. Okay, hon?

5
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,813
This lamp. Sweet. Oh.

Yeah. Whoa. [groans]

Welcome home, Sean Floyd.

14
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,574
All right, Donnie's here.
See you guys tomorrow.

15
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,658
All right, honey.

16
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,410
- Have fun camping, kiddo.
- Bye!

00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,418
Holy shit.

00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,003
- What is this?
- I don't know!

22
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,172
- Oh, my God.
- [father] Work!

23
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,467
- Just walk over, hit the button on the TV.
- What are they doing?

24
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,052
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

- [moaning, panting]

00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,223
Dude, what are you doing?
Are you serious?

27
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,102
Sean Floyd, back on American soil
for one week only!

28
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,438
Dude, turn that off.
My little brother is crying in there.

- [cell phone clicks]
- That's crazy porn.

30

[Donnie] She's a big girl.

31
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,443
What are you wearing?

32
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,071
They're my hiking shorts.

33
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,281
Why do those cover your belly button
but not your balls?

34
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,992
What's that on your face?
You spilled something on your face.

35
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,329
It looks like you drank a glass
of Ed Sheeran's pubes.

36
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,207
In fact, the '80s nostalgia wave
we're living in, it's about to crest.

37
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,459
When it does, I'm gonna be swimming
in puss. Know why?

38
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,169
Are you growing a <i>Narcos </i>coke 'stache?

39
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,254
I am growing a <i>Narcos </i>coke 'stache,
my friend.

40
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,964
- You're growing a coke 'stache.
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,675
Donnie Escobar, right here.

42
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,592

How you doing, pal?

00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,389
- I'm good. How are you?
- Glad to have you back.

Ah, it's good to be back and...

- Hey, Mrs. Abelar.
- Hey.

56
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,619
Hi.

57
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,039
[sighs] Jeremy,
what are you doing over there?

58
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,250
- [mouthing]
- [Mrs. Abelar] Jeremy!

59
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,211
I can see
you are jerking off the walking stick!

60
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,546
Mom, I'm packing.

61
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,007
Your dad and I are leaving in an hour,
and I want you out of here ASAP.

62
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,217
Okay, I'm going!

63
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
Oh, God, I so need this vacation.

64
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,888
Six hours,
I'll be in Napa with a Zinfandel.

65
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,390
[both] Bye, Mrs. Abelar.

66
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,808
Look who the fuck is back.

67
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,185
- [Sean] What's up, man?
- [laughing] What's up, man?

68
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,273
Yo, you dogs ready to get...
[softly]...fucked up?

69
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,482
- Oh, yeah.
- Show him the ID.

70
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,776
[in normal voice] It's a military ID.

71
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,611
[chuckling] 1991, dude.

72
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,239
- What? You buy stuff with this?
- [Donnie] Fuck yeah, he does.

Jack Jessop reporting for booze.

74
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,826
You don't look like this guy.

75
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,453
This guy looks like a soldier.

76
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,163
- You look like Pocahontas.
- [Jeremy scoffs]

77
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,498
- No one says shit to an Army ranger.
- All right.

78
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,418
I found this outside the booth
at the gun and knife show

79
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,588
when I was picking up this bad boy.
Check it out. Check it out.

80
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,589
Huh?

81
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,757
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

82
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,799
Hoo-rah!

83
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,301
- Pretty tight, huh?
- Yeah, it's cool.

84
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,512
This is in case we run into any crazy shit
out in the woods.

85
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,474
- Like, fucking crazy shit! Shit. Fuck!
- Whoa, man!

86
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,225
- I'm... Sorry, dude.
- [Donnie] Come on, man.

87
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,021
I try to act like I'm riding a bike,
but I still got the training wheels on.

88
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,397
- You feel me?
- [Donnie] Yeah.

89
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,441
- Let's pack up the van.
- Let's do it!

90
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,570
- Yeah, let's just get out of here.
- [Sean] Let's pack it up. Hit the road.

91
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,197
[Donnie] Why are there so many bags?

92
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,573
- What is all this shit?
- Oh!

93
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:47,078
Uh... Yeah,
there's a slight change of plans, dude.

94
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,332
It sucks total donkey dick.

95
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,834
- Stop going through my shit, perv.
- [Donnie] Sarah?

96
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,337
No. No. No!

97
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,464
No, no. No way.
[chuckles] No, no, no.

98
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,841
- For real?
- Why does this feel so awkward?

99
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,927
Jeremy, did you not tell them
that we were coming?

100
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,806
I was... I'm telling them now.
Like, they're learning of it right now.

101
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,933
- Are you kidding?
- They're coming.

102
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,018
Welcome back, Sean.

103
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,895
Hey! Hey, what's up?

104
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,607
- Do you not hug people anymore?
- [Sean] Oh, yeah, sorry.

105
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,108
- They don't hug in Germany?
- [Sean] Yeah.

106
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,945
Welcome back. I mean, I'm back.
You're not back.

107
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,364
I'm just back for the next week.
Hey, Sarah, what's up?

108
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,532
Were you really in Germany?

109
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,493
There was a rumor you were in rehab
for bath salts.

110
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,578
- Everyone's talking about it.
- What? No.

111
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,580
<i>Nein! Nein! </i>I was in Germany. Yeah.

112
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,415
Cool hiking gear.

113
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,209
[Sean] Hmm? Oh. What?

114
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,419
- How'd that get tucked in?
- [Sarah] Stop!

115
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,213
- You're ruining my bra!
- I don't care.

116
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,549
[Sarah] This shit's expensive. Stop!

117
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,009
Jeremy said we're going six miles
into the woods.

118
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:43,927
Yeah!

119
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,595
Yeah. I'm glad you're coming, though.

120
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,472
It's gonna be worth it
when you see me twerking

121
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,182
with Mother Nature. [chuckles]

122
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,185
Are you gonna be twerking
against a tree or...

123
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
- How does that work?
- I don't know.

124
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,023
- [laughs]
- [Donnie] Excuse me!

125
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,317
This is supposed to be a bros trip.

126
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,279
So I need a group meeting. Now! Sean!

127
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,073
- Sounds mad. Yeah.
- I gotta go. Um...

128
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:06,908
Bye.

129
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,871
Hey, did you guys know that people think
I've been in rehab?

130
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:11,830
- Yeah.
- [Donnie] Yeah.

131
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,041
[stammers] Yeah, it's some bullshit rumor,
dude. Forget about it.

132
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,627
Look, I'm feeling fucking betrayed
with you, J-Tron.

133
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,170
Chad and my sister broke up yesterday,

134
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,131
so she bailed on Cancun
with his family.

135
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,300
- That's fine.
- [chuckles] Oh, what? They broke up?

136
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,637
- That sucks.
- Yeah, she found out he cheated on her...

137
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,723
I don't care what happened.

138
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,684
I'm not going camping with my ex
this weekend.

139
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,061
Wait,
I thought you guys were never "official."

140
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,272
Yeah, that's one of our many disputes.
Thank you, Sean.

141
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,401
Spring break. Indigonanza...

142
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,030
- is about bros. Bonding.
- Uh-huh.

143
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,489
Ceremoniously drinking

144
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,951
a bottle of Indigo Caribbean Spiced Rum
in 48 hours.

145
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,246
- That's the tradition.
- This is true.

146
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,541
Plus, we only have Sean for one week
before he goes back to dipping his balls

147
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,376
in sauerkraut
for the rest of the school year.

148
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,878
That's not something we do.

149
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,213
All right.
This is shitty for me too, okay?

150
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,090
My girlfriend freaked out
when she found out

151
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,217
ladies were coming
and I didn't invite her.

152
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,095
How many times do I have to tell you?
You're being catfished.

153
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,724
Her name is Kendall Jenners.

154
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,517
With an S.

155
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,978
- Not real.
- That's her name, okay?

156
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,647
She's real, all right?

157
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,317
We're gonna meet this summer
at theater camp and we're gonna have sex.

158
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,320
Hey, actually, that reminds me, Sean.

159
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,949
This weekend might actually be your chance
to bang my sister.

160
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,117
- Whoa, whoa!
- What the fuck?

161
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,871
She's my twin sister, okay?
We have this special connection thing.

162
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,332
If she's having sex,
it's like if I'm having sex.

163
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,085
- Dude, that's gro... Don't say that! Now...
- Why not?

164
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,754
Why would you not want me to feel sex?
Sex is great.

165
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,755
It's your fucking twin.

166
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,173
- Don't be disgust...
- [screaming]

167

- Oh, no!

399
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,495
Why... why are you looking down there?

400
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,664
Keep your eyes above... No.
What are you doing?

401
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,249
That's not okay. That's...

Sean, you didn't it?

405
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,097
What about you, Donnie?
[crying] Did you see my dick?

406
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,433
- [gasps]
- What is... What is happening?

407
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,394
- I just cut off my dick.
- Jeremy, is this a fucking prank?

408
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,313
Don't be stupid.
Come on, show me your dick.

409
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,814
I cut off my dick, Becky!

410

[Jeremy crying, moaning]

413
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,408
I don't think it'll be okay.

414
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,077
You'll be fine, man.
We'll lay you down.

415
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,828
- [all grunt]
- [Sean] Come on.

416
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,413
Here we go. Put this under his head.

00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,708
Shit. That's a lot of blood, goddammit!
That's a lot of blood.

418
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,628
- [groans] I'm gonna fucking die.
- [Donnie] Jeremy's gonna die.

419
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,880
We can all stand here and have a meltdown

420
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,132
or we can get our shit together
and save Jeremy.

421
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,634
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

422
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,679
- We need to call 911, now.
- [Sean] Yeah, get our phones.

423
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,682
- Kendall... theater camp.
- [Sean] My phone's in the van.

424
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,768
- [Donnie] Don't die.
- Fuck. I don't have any service. Do you?

425
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,936
- I don't.
- Fuck. Me neither.

426
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,813
- I got nothing.
- Fuck. You don't have service?

427
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,564
Just...
Oh, give me one second to think.

428
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,025
Okay. I'm going to the top of the ridge.
Give me your phones.

429
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,152
Okay. One of them has to have service,
right?

430
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,613
- What's the passcodes?
- 3-5-3-2.

431
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,574
69-69, which is pretty ironic now.

432
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,035
- Mine's 0-0-4-7.
- 0-0-4-7.

433
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,829
- Go.
- What's your passcode, Donnie?

434
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,664
- All ones, dude. All ones.
- Okay.

Guys! Hey, guys, in times like these,
we... we gotta... Fucking...

436
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,586
- [Donnie] Just go!
- [Sarah] Get out of here!

437
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,089
- [Sean] Yeah, I'm going!
- [Becky] Oh, my God. Okay, Jeremy.

438
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,968
Someone...
Someone needs to find the... penis.

439
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,428
- [Jeremy] Get my penis.
- Okay.

440
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,929
- Get my penis.
- [Donnie] Yeah.

441
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,806
Dude, I'm gonna get your fucking peen.

442
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,516
I'm taking this. I'm getting a flashlight.

443
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,810
- I'm gonna go with Donnie.
- Yeah, I'll stay with Jeremy.

444
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,604
- It's gonna be okay, right? All good?
- It's gonna be okay. Yeah.

445
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,732
You're gonna get my dick.
I'm gonna get my dick back.

446
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,275
Yeah, we're gonna find it.

447
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,820
Just for scale, what am I looking for?
Like half this? A... a quarter?

448
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,030
I'm not gonna tell her how big my dick is.

449
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,366
- I'm gonna take it as a quarter.
- [Jeremy groans]

450
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,410
If this doesn't work out, Becky,

451
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,912
- I'm gonna be your sister now.
- Okay.

452
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,706
- You already have the hair for it.
- Yeah.

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,899
Fucking send.

497
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,194
- Send it. Come on.
- Did you get a signal?

498
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,280
[both scream, gasp]

499
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,032
- Oh!
- Sean?

500
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,286
Please tell me that wasn't all the phones.

501
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,245
No, no.

502
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,207
- I mean, yes, it was...
- It was.

503
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,751
...all the phones.
But, hey, hey, I called 911.

504
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,379
I talked to them. They're gonna send
a medevac in 30 minutes.

505
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,006
- So... So that's good!
- Okay.

506
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,424
- Yeah!
- Let's go. Let's go.

507
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,717
That's... All right.

508
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,971
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa!

509
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,431
It's a fucking mushroom, dude.

510
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,517
- Everything looks like a dick at night!
- What is that?

511
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,894
Hmm?

512
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,479
Is that a piece of coyote scat?
Are there coyotes here?

513
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,149
That's not shit.

514
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,484
[Sarah] What do you mean?

515
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,194
That's Jeremy's dick.

516
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,195
Oh, my God.

517
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,032
[retches]

518
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,620
Damn it.

519
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,414
I'm gonna get some sticks
to pick that up with.

520
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,166
[groans]

521
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,043
- The medevac's on its way.
- [sighs]

522
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,127
We got the dick!

523
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,712
- Yes.
- And Sarah puked on it.

524
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,380
- [Sarah] Donnie!
- Sean lost the phones.

525
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,340
[both] What?

526
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,550
First my dick, and now my 7, Sean!

527
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,428
Is my pee-pee okay?

528
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,722
- Okay. We gotta keep this warm.
- Okay.

529
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,433
Where is it? I wanna see it. Where...

530
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,935
[Sarah] Warm it up, baby. Come on.

531
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,728
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?

532
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,272
I'm keeping the capillaries open.
Stop yelling at me.

533
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,565
You gotta put that on ice!

534
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,776
I don't know.
They don't teach you this in health class.

535
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,861
My dick is on a stick!

536
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,947
- Gotta put it on some ice.
- Ice, ice!

537
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,117
[Becky and Sarah] Ew!

538
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,260
[sighs]

539
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,721
Do you think the helicopter
is gonna find us?

540
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,433
I hope so.

541
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,769

564
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,477
Oh, my God. It didn't see us.
It didn't see us.

565
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,519
[Donnie] Okay.

566
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,606
- This. This'll get their attention.
- What are you doing?

567
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,149
Fuck this! Everybody run.

568
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,026

What? Yo! Yo!

570
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,072
[Donnie] Get your head down, Jeremy.

571
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,907
Fuck you, Donnie!

572
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,493
[screams] Oh... Okay.

573
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,036
Guys?

574
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,747
- What the fuck?
- Guys!

575
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,166
Seriously?

576
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,003
Wow, Donnie, I am so impressed.
This is some of your best work.

578
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,726

[shrieks]

580
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,022
- What the fuck!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

581
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,483
- [Jeremy continues screaming]
- Damn, that was dope.

582
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,734
- [Becky] You okay?
- [Jeremy] No.

583
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,152
[Sarah] Holy shit. That was crazy.

584
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,114
- Oh, hey! It worked! Hey, we're here!
- [all shouting]

585
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,575
- Let's get the dick. I got it. Let's go.
- [Becky] Let's go, Jeremy.

586
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,078
- [Jeremy groaning]
- [Sean] Oh, hey!

587
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,788
Hey, guys. Come on!

588
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,377
- [Sarah] Hey, look! Hey!
- [Sean] Hey!

589
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,419
- [Donnie] Hey!
- [Becky] Hi.

590
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,713
Hey!

591
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,219
We'll get him to East General Hospital,
ASAP.

592
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:21,014
As long as it's within twelve hours,
a severed member can still be reattached.

593
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,266
- Yes!
- Okay, thank you.

594
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,059
[man] Your friends did a good job.
You're gonna be okay.

595
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:24,977
[Becky] Thank you!

596
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,563
Whose idea was it
to set off the fireball?

597
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,856
That was all me, dude.

598
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,274
You're a fucking idiot!

599
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,609
We saw you guys on our initial approach.

600
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,988
Hike down to your car
and you can meet him at the hospital.

601
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,657
Okay. [laughing] Okay, okay. Hey.

602
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,411
You're gonna be okay. Yeah.
We're gonna see you at the hospital, okay?

603
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,330
Becky, you need to shut the fuck up.
You're wasting time. We gotta go.

604
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,456
Okay, yeah! Yeah!

605
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,417
- He's not gonna die!
- He's gonna be fine.

606
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,337
- [whoops]
- [Sean] Stay strong, Jeremy!

607
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,797
[Sarah] Bye, Jeremy.

608
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,469
Look. He's reverse-<i>Terminator</i>- ing.

609
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,721
That's epic.

610
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,893
Okay. He's gonna be okay.

611
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,395
- [laughs]
- Oh, my God. Thank God.

612
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,610
- [giggles] He's good.
- He's good.

613
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,115
- [all laughing]
- [crying, sniffles]

614
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,366
Whoo!

615
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,475
- [Becky] He really lost a lot of blood.
- [Sarah] Yeah, man, I'm covered.

616
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,853
Can I propose a little toast
to the first responders?

617
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,772
- [Sean] Yes.
- May the heroes that...

618
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,026
- Guys?
- What?

619
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,111
- What?
- Guys!

620
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,322
What? Ah!

621
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,243
- What is it? [gasps]
- [Sarah] What? [gasps]

622
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,581
Sean?

623
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,209
You gave the EMT the wrong cooler?

624
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,379
No! No, no. No way.

625
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,965
- Wait. Wait, we have the dick!
- Donnie, no!

626
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,841
- [Donnie] Wait! Come back!
- [all shouting] Oh!

627
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,011
- [groans] Oh, shit!
- [Sarah] The ice...

628
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,272
- [Donnie sighs]
- [sighs]

629
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,898
We have my brother's dick.

630
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,734
With no ice and no phones.

631
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,321
- [Becky] We have 12 hours, right?
- Yeah, I think the EMT meant if it's,

632
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,322
you know, on ice.

633
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,741
Oh, shit! Oh, wait. They... they...

634
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,034
They also told us to hike down.

635
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,744
They probably don't think
we're here anymore.

636
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,163
Shit. Look, I'm willing to wait and see.

637
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,374
But by that time,
Jeremy's dick is gonna be rotten

638
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,417
and have flies on it...

639
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,836
No, no, no, no, we can't freak out.
Don't freak out.

640
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,170
We'll hike down.

641
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,466
We'll... We'll find someone with ice
or a phone along the way.

642
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:02,968
And worst case,

643
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,763
we'll be back in the parking lot
in, like, six or seven hours.

644
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,765
This is gonna work.

645
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,186
Yeah, okay, Becky's right.
Let's do this.

646
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,022
This is gonna work.
That's a good plan.

647
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,234
Okay, let's leave our shit.
We'll move faster.

648
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,278
- Okay. It's gonna be a long way.
- Okay, let's go.

649
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,529
[Sarah] Okay.

650
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,328
[man, echoing] Hey, stay with us.
Don't head for the light!

651
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,537
Hang in there, buddy.

652
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,206
We got a male. Severed penis.
Cut clean to the base.

653
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,292
- [woman] Oh, shit.
- [man] What?

654
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,128
[woman] There's no penis.
It's just two cans of Flittson.

655
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,296
My dick isn't in there?

656
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,716
Just cans. There's literally no penis.
It's just two cans of beer.

657
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:47,179
[echoing] You guys, where's my dick?

658
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,727
[Sean] I don't think this is a good plan.

659
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,064
I told Becky it was. We've been hiking
for over an hour, and there's no one.

660
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,692
[Donnie] Of course it's not a good plan.
There are no good plans in this situation.

661
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,235
Look, um... [sighs]

662
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,445
- Dude.
- What?

663
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,572
- Uh, he texted her.
- Who texted her?

664
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,032
- Chad.
- What?

665
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,034
When I was calling 911
from Becky's phone,

666
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,452
- [groans]
- Chad texted,

667
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,828
and said he wants
to get back together.

668
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,122
- <i>Rent </i>cast party, man.
- Yeah, I, um...

669
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,583
Oh, man, I think I fucked up.

670
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,252
I, like,
I think I texted him back as her.

671
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,255
[Donnie] Whoa. That is epic.
What did you say?

672
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,217
I said, "Fuck you,"
and then I called him a dirty taint.

673
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,718
- [laughs]
- Guys! Guys?

674
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,096
We're gonna stop and pee really quick.

675
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,848
Ginger Pablo Escobar,
please keep your eyes downhill.

676
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,975
[Donnie] Ha! Hope you pee on your shoes.

677
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,727
People are noticing.

678
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,687
It still looks like you blew
Chester Cheetah.

679
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,272
- Oh, shit!
- What?

680
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,400
- Is Donnie coming to perv on me?
- [Becky] No.

681
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,734
Hey, Sean!

682
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,071
Sean, there's a ranger lookout station.
They might have ice.

683
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,906
Hey, that's good.

684
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,408
That's awesome. Let's go.

685
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,910
<i>- ♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪</i>
- Sorry.

686
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,122
<i>- ♪ Like I know you want me to do ♪</i>
- Over there. Come on.

687
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,623
<i>- ♪ Hey! ♪</i>
- Let's go!

688
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,291
Let's go!

689
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:00,710
[Sean] Hello?

690
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,296
- Hello, anybody?
- [Donnie] Hello?

691
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,715
- Hello?
- Hello?

692
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,593
We need some help! It's an emergency!

693
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,845
- Excuse me?
- Hello?

694
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,221
[Becky and Donnie] Hello?

695
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,347
Is anybody home?

696
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,307
Seems like we have to break into
this bitch.

697
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,809
What? We're not doing that.

698
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,561
I don't know.
This is government property.

699
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,854
I feel like it would be...

700
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,105
a bad idea.

701
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,065
Damn.

702
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,985
But, yeah, you know,
this is a time-sensitive case

703
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,820
so it's a good call. It's a good call.

704
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,370
- [all sigh]
- [Donnie] Mm, it's empty.

705
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,580
[Sarah] Great.

706
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,252
[Donnie] Please have ice. Please have ice.

707
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,421
- [flies buzzing]
- [Becky] Oh, dude. No, close that.

708
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,715
[coughs]

709
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,426
Well maybe there's still a phone
or radio or something, right?

710
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,802
- Yeah? Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

711
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,894
- [rattling]
- [screaming] Oh, my God!

712
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,520
Oh, my God!

713
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,563
[all gasp]

714
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,818
- [Sarah] Oh!
- [Becky] No, no, no.

715
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,904
I think the rattlesnake bit the dick.

716
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,031
[Donnie] Oh, my God. A snake bit the dick?

717
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,866
We have to get the venom out somehow.

718
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,826
- Yeah. How do we do that?
- We have to get it out.

719
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,496
Maybe if we shake it a lot,
the venom will pour out.

720
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,872
No, we have to, uh...

721
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,543
Someone has to suck it out.

722
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,092
It seems only fair that the person who's
had that dick in their mouth do it.

723
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,555
Donnie,
what the fuck are you talking about?

724
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,184
- I'm obviously referring to Becky.
- What?

725
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,104
You guys shared a womb together,
so obviously at some point in the dark...

726
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,482
- that dick went in your mouth.
- This idiot.

727
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,859
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Fumbling around.

728
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,571
Donnie, I didn't suck his fetus penis
when I was in the womb.

729
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,031
I am his sister.

730
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,075
I am obviously the last person
to suck the dick.

731
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,744
- You're sucking before I do.
- [Donnie] I'm sucking... [laughs]

732
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,829
I am not sucking my brother's dick.
End of story.

733
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,332
The women should suck the dick.
We don't even know how.

734
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:06,127
It's not even the same kind of sucking,
you stupid idiot.

735
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,756
- [Donnie] I am not going to do it!
- [Sarah] You should. This is your fault.

736
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,883
- [Becky] Yeah, you should.
- I'll do it.

737
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:16,471
I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll suck it!
I will suck the dick.

738
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,724
I lost the phones.

739
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,018
I gave them the wrong cooler.

740
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,188
I'll suck the penis.

741
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,775
- It's really cool of you. Thanks.
- Yeah.

742
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:29,985
Just, uh...

743
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,779
I'd like to do it...

744
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:34,948
alone.

745
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,575
Yeah, you got it.

746
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,368
- I'll tell your story.
- Okay.

747
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:39,953
You're a hero.

748
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:40,912
Yup.

749
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,004
You da man.

750
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,158
[gulps]

751
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:19,909
Thanks.

752
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,038
[clears throat]

753
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,000
Man, we came all the way up here
for nothing.

754
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,588
I really fucked this up. I'm sorry.

755
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,924
What now? We're just gonna run down
this mountain and pray that J-Tron's D

756
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,509
doesn't fester before the car?

757
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,804
We've only been hiking for three hours.

758
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,515
That means we still have nine hours.

759
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,935
- That was before it got bit by a snake.
- [high-pitched whining]

760
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,688
You guys hear that?

761
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,067
Dude, look!

762
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,860
[Becky] A drone?

763
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,154
Wait a minute. Wait.

764
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,405
If there's a drone,

765
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,450
that means there's a person,
and they probably have a phone.

766
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,703
We should... We should follow it.
Let's go get Sean.

767
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,748
- Sean! Sean, there's a drone... Oh!
- [loud sucking]

768
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,041
[all screaming]

769
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,543
- [yelps] Don't look at me!
- Sorry. Sorry.

770
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:14,422
Uh, it's just... There's a drone,
so there's people, and we need to go now.

771
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,424
Oh, my God. That's great. Okay. Um...

772
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:20,303
Just... Stop looking.
One second. I gotta... [sucks loudly]

773
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm getting a lot of venom
out of this thing.

774
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,265
[drone buzzing]

775
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,269
[Donnie] Hey!

776
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,066
Come here! [pants]

777
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,193
[Sarah] There. Get it.

778
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:36,861
[Sean] Stop!

779
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,489
[all panting]

780
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,867
- Where'd it go?
- Does anybody see it?

781
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,621
Oh! There it goes.

782
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,039
I got this shit.

783
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,155
[inaudible]

784
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,242
[Sarah screams]

785
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,035
- [yelps] Sarah!
- Oh, shit!

786
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:26,953
Fuck!

787
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,873
- Oh, my God! [gasps] Oh!
- Fuck!

788
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,833
I got it! [laughs]

789
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,044
- [Becky] Are you okay?
- [Sarah] Yeah, totally!

790
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,423
- There are people there. They have a boat.
- [Donnie] Nice!

791
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,758
Watch this.

792
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,261
Let's get wet! [screams]

793
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,013
- [Sean] Oh, shit.
- [Becky] Oh, my God.

794
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,768
- [laughing] Holy fuck.
- Whoo!

795
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:50,769
Yeah!

796
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,812
- That was pretty cool.
- Yeah.

797
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,023
Yeah. It looks easy.
He made it look easy!

798
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,400
- Yeah. Do... do you wanna go next?
- Yeah!

799
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:58,860
Yeah, yeah. No, I'll go.

800
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,280
Hey, I get the feeling
that you maybe don't wanna jump.

801
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,575
So, uh, we can try to find
a way to hike down.

802
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,203
- No, I wanna... I want to go.
- Okay.

803
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,829
<i>Es geht um die Wurst, ja?</i>

804
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,998
Which means "it's do or die" in German.

805
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,917
Actually,
the literal German translation is,

806
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,919
"it's all about sausage," which is funny...

807
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,254
Are you making a dick joke right now?
We, like, gotta go.

808
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,923
Yeah. Obviously. Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

809
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,049
- Let's do it.
- All right.

810
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,302
I'm not gonna take the long way,
I'm gonna take the Sean way, huh?

811
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,095
- Oh, shit!
- [Becky] Oh, my God!

812
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,348
- Fuck! Oh, fuck.
- [Donnie] Oh!

813
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:33,228
[screaming]

814
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,772
Yeah!

815
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,275
I'm good! I'm good! Whoo!

816
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,447
- [all panting]
- So, the "Sean way" is going for

817
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,033
the maximum amount of pain
you can inflict on your body?

818
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,952
No, no.
Honestly, it didn't hurt that much.

819
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,455
It was actually really fun.
I actually... It was a fun ride.

820
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,998
- [Donnie groans]
- Ooh.

821
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,542
Oh, my God.

822
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,044
Dude, uh, your back is like...

823
00:38:58,837 --> 00:38:59,671
red raw.

824
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,508
- [Sean wails]
- [laughs]

825
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,593
[Sean, groaning] Oh my... Oh, my God.

826
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,637
- [helicopter blades whirring]
- Oh, fuck me.

827
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,763
You guys, look.

828
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,348
Huh?

829
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,686
- [Donnie] Oh! That's so dumb.
- [all mumbling]

830
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,231
They fucking came back.
And we're not there. That's awesome.

831
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,276
[screams] Ow!

832
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,821
- Damn it!
- All right, man! Jesus. We're all mad.

833
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,739
No, the wind blew against my back.

834
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,408
It's okay. I'm fine.

835
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,285
- [screams]
- [laughs]

836
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,202
What?

837
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,914
You guys, come on. Let's...
Let's just keep going.

838
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,793
- [woman speaking indistinctly over PA]
- [monitor beeping]

839
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,131
- The helicopter went back to the campsite.
- Yes.

840
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,216
- But your friends weren't there.
- No.

841
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,596
So, the doctor's gonna need to operate
before this gets infected.

842
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,264
Okay. No, my friends,

843
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,725
they'll... they'll get me my penis back.
I know they will.

844
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:58,062
Okay, I know they will, too.
If they don't, though, you'll be fine.

845
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,525
We can do a full penal reconstruction
using a graft from your forearm or glute.

846
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,110
The results are fantastic.

847
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,195
- Really?
- Absolutely.

848
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,281
In addition to increased self-esteem,

849
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,658
most patients report
successful ejaculation

850
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,327
in ten percent of sexual encounters.

851
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,246
On a pleasure scale,
we're hitting mid-to high-threes.

852
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,539
Is that good?

853
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,291
Those numbers sound bad.

854
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,210
Well, in comparison
with not having a penis,

855
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,795
I think those numbers sound great.

856
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,131
Okay. I will wait for my dick.

857
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,052
I have a strong dick.
I know it'll last days out in the wild.

858
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:29,969
No.

859
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,847
Everyone thinks their penis is special.
It's not.

860
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:37,185
Okay? It's like one of these flowers.
Right?

861
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,189
If you remove it from the body,
cut off its flow of blood,

862
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,652
and then eventually,
if left on its own, it will wilt...

863
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,278
and die.

864
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,828
HBO's on Channel 3.

865
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,210
Come on, guys.

866
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,673
I know you're doing whatever it takes
to get here as fast as you can.

867
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,801
[Sean] Hey, Becky!

868
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:14,347
[stammering] Hey, don't beat yourself up
over the helicopter.

869
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,558
I think you're doing great.
I've always thought you were really great.

870
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,812
[Becky] Uh, are you forgetting the time
you totally rejected me?

871
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,065
[Sean] That never happened.
I don't remember that happening.

872
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,276
[Becky] Come on.
Remember the <i>Rent </i>cast party?

873
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,113
- Kinda made a move.
- I... might remember.

874
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,533
I had a momentary crush on you.

875
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,454
- [Sean] You had a crush on me?
- [Becky] I just thought...

876
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,540
[panting] Sean, emergency bro discussion.

877
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,375
- [Sean] One sec, man.
- 911, Sean.

878
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,877
- You better go. Sounds very important.
- Sorry.

879
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,256
Sean, Sean, you are not gonna believe
what I found in the woods.

880
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,883
Wait till you feast your eyes on these.

881
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,220
What are those? Why do you have those?

882
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,098
When Sarah went behind that big bush
to dry off or whatever,

883
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,891
I went after her, 'cause I needed to pee.

884
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,769
Okay, I find those waiting on a rock.

885
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,354
For me.

886
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,023
Knew she came to win me back.

887
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:09,485
What? Maybe she just didn't want to wear
wet underwear, you psychopath.

888
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,612
That's like serial killer behavior.

889
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,864
Okay, these are a sign.

890
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,992
She wants us to be together.
And you know what, Sean?

891
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,036
I'll tell you the truth.
I'm ready to forgive her.

892
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,412
Forgive her for what?

893
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,748
Over Christmas break, usual spot,

894
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,166
abandoned church
my grandma used to take me to.

895
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,543
Before we start hooking up,
I throw around I want a DTR.

896
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,046
- She freaks out.
- DTR?

897
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,547
You said you wanted dick to rim?

898
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,425
No. What?
I wanted to "define the relationship."

899
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,969
- What the fuck is dick to rim?
- I don't know. Butt stuff.

900
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,138
What has happened to you in Germany?

901
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:41,309
Anyway, I tell her I wanna DTR.

902
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,686
And she's all like,
"Relationships are bullshit."

903
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,772
Then I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to do.

904
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,483
So I kick her out of a car...
may or may not have been moving.

905
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,110
- Wow, that's really mean.
- I also told her...

906
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,779
um, that I never liked her.

907
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,364
- [clicks tongue] Wow, man.
- And she was gaining weight.

908
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,245
Sean! [whispering] This is a power play.

909
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,538
She wants me back.

910
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,624
[Sean] Come on, Donnie.
The camp's around this bend.

911
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,003
- [Sarah] Hi! Hello. Hey, bud!
- [Donnie] Hey, buddy.

912
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,588
- [Sean] Hey, there.
- [Becky] Hey, hi.

913
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,048
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

914
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,591
- [Donnie] Whoo!
- [Sarah] Hey.

915
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,259
I believe this belongs to you.

916
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:19,222
And I believe you're the bitch
that fucked it up!

917
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,431
- What now?
- Whoa.

918
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,600
You better have cash to pay for this.

919
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,269
Okay, uh, where are your parents?

920
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,438
My dad went fly-fishing.

921
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,565
What about the boat? Where are the keys?

922
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,068
Because we're in an emergency,
and we need some help.

923
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:36,489
All right. If I'm gonna give you the keys,
then I wanna see some stuff.

924
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,700
- [laughing] Okay.
- [laughs]

925
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,829
- No. Ugh.
- We are not going to show you our boobs.

926
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:43,996
Bitch, please!

927
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,290
I'm 11, not five.

928
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,168
- I've seen thousands of titties.
- [chuckles]

929
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,629
I wanna see you two scissor.

930
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,922
[gasps]

931
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,048
- [Becky] Yeah!
- [Sean] Oh!

932
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,884
- Take that, you little perv. Gross.
- That is inappropriate.

933
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,137
I'm not helping you with shit!

934
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,222
Stay the fuck away from me!

935
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,559
- Kid's a monster.
- Jesus Christ.

936
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,477
I kind of love him, though.

937
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,855
Okay, if we're not outta here in,
like, an hour…

938
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,357
- Jeremy will be dickless...
- [Sarah] The rest of his life.

939
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,192
That's decades with no dick.

940
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,278
No. We need that boat.

941
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,488
Fuck this little baby Bieber wannabe.

942
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,198
[Sarah] What are you doing?

943
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,785
Listen here, you little terrorist.
This is my brother's dick.

944
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,538
He's in the hospital right now,
and he needs us.

945
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,000
We need your boat so we can get
to the hospital to reattach it.

946
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,087
Listen, kid, when we're around,
dicks get cut and dicks get sucked.

947
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,630
I saw him suck this dick.

948
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,300
I sucked that dick this morning.
Now, give us the keys.

949
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,552
[shrieks]

950
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:40,928
[Becky] Yes!

951
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:45,391
[Sean] All right. Tell your dad the boat's
gonna be at the south campground lot.

952
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,476
Jesus, Sean,
that dick really fucked him up.

953
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,645
He hasn't said a word
since you showed him the dick.

954
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,272
What if he never talks again?

955
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,318
- [Sean] Whatever. Fuck this kid.
- [Becky] The worst.

956
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,652
[Donnie] Piece of shit, anyway.

957
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,490
[man] Hey, buddy.

958
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,411
Son are... Are you okay?

959
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,622
Dicks get cut.

960
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,875
Dicks get sucked.

961
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,796
- [Sarah] All right. I got you.
- [Becky] Okay.

962
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,757
Good God. Hey!

963
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,842
- Hey!
- Oh, shit!

964
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,387
- [Donnie] Oh, my God! Go!
- Guys, we gotta go!

965
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,557
- Go! Shit! There's too many keys.
- [Sarah] I'm getting the anchor.

966
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,435
Hello, sir, I can completely explain
what's going on here.

967
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,395
What have you done to my son?

968
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,189
It's a good thing you're...
Okay, fuck this.

969
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,107
[man] I'll kill all of you perverts!

970
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,818
- [Becky screams]
- [man screams]

971
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,363
- [man grunts]
- [shrieks]

972
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,531
- Hey, he has a bruise. Leave him alone.
- [keys jingle]

973
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,116
[yelps] You're a fucker!

974
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,160
- Hit me again. I fucking dare you!
- [grunts]

975
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:49,330
- [screams]
- Oh, my God. Ugh. Go.

976
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,207
[Donnie] Let's go! Come on! Move!

977
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,291
[Sarah] I got it!

978
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,001
I'm gonna kill you, son of a bitch.

979
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,169
Back the fuck up!

980
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,005
- [laughs]
- Oh, fuck.

981
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,841
Oh, God. It's slipping, guys!

982
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,886
Shit! He's <i>Cliffhanger</i>- ing!
Oh, hold it, Sean.

983
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,264
- Fucker!
- [groans]

984
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,432
- [Sarah] Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- I got it.

985
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,018
[motor whirs]

986
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,771
- [Donnie] Fucker!
- [Sean] Auf Wiedersehen!

987
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,439
[man] Hey! That's my boat!

988
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:16,983
Come back with my boat!

989
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,319
- [chuckles] Holy shit.
- [Sean] Whoo!

990
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,822
That was insane.

991
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,075
- That guy tried to murder us.
- Yeah. He was crazy.

992
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:29,787
I mean, in all fairness,
he probably thought we molested his kid.

993
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,540
I shouldn't have said,
"Dicks get cut and dicks get sucked."

994
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,666

She likes to text.
She doesn't like talking.

1161
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,263
That is definitely a catfish.

1162
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,974
Okay, look. Anyway, if I'm gonna die,

1163
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:33,353
[sighs] I need her to know...
that I love her.

1164
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:36,440
You're not gonna die.
You just won't have a penis.

1165
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,442
I'd rather die than not have my penis.

1166
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,943
We've waited all day.

1167
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,904
It's been almost 12 hours.

1168
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,739
We haven't heard anything
from your friends.

1169
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,158
- Yeah, but there's still time.
- Nah.

1170
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,161
Look at the flower. Look.
It still has most of its petals.

1171
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,289
What? No. Dude... The flower...

1172
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,041
that was an example.

1173
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,711
Did you think that that flower
was magically linked to your penis?

1174
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,840
This isn't <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

1175
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:05,719
But me and my friends are fucking idiots.
They're gonna need more time.

1176
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,805
Honestly, it's not looking good.

1177
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,475
So, let's just hope your friends
are arriving right now.

1178
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,603
[tires screech]

1179
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,272
[panting]

1180
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,317
Hi! Hi! We're here for Jeremy Abelar.

1181
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,028
We have a... a special delivery.

1182
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,239
Uh, one moment. [stammers]

1183
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,324
- Abelar? Abelar.
- [Becky] Abelar. Yes.

1184
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,909
A-B-Oh... Ooh...

1185
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,161
I just gotta go back here.

1186
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,330
[sighs] That's it.

1187
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,582
Ah! Yep.

1188
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,668
Ah, we don't have a patient
under that name.

1189
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,713
Uh, the helicopter EMT said
they would be bringing him here.

1190
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,507
I don't know what to tell you.
He's not here.

1191
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,925
They sometimes reroute medevacs.

1192
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,219
I'd try Clarkson Memorial.
They have a helipad.

1193
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,143
[echoing] Fu...

1194
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,689
[tires screeching]

1195
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,108
...ck!

1196
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,402
[panting] Let's go.

1197
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,364
Go, go, go, go, go!

1198
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,368
Everybody, listen up!

1199
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,704
There is a penis in this cooler!

1200
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,497
Are we in the right place or what?

1201
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:16,748
Is that the penis?

1202
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,166
- Yes! Yes!
- Thank God. Yes.

1203
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,711
Oh! We didn't think you guys
were gonna make it.

1204
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,547
- The penis is here!
- [nurse grunts]

1205
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,633
Page the anesthesiologist.
I want to get into surgery immediately.

1206
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,552
- [Becky and Sean] Yes!
- [doctor] Hey!

1207
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,805
You guys did good.

1208
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,600
Ooh! Also, it got bit by a snake.

1209
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,978
I sucked it pretty good,
but you should still check for venom.

1210
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:42,733
[doctor] Prep the OR!

1211
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:43,901
Goddamn hero.

1212
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,154
- Yes!
- [all giggle, exclaim]

1213
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,531
- [Sean] Yes! Oh, God.
- [Donnie] Ow! Oh, ow!

1214
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:52,075
- Someone's thumb went in my hole.
- You okay?

1215
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,170
- [sighs]
- You can scoot closer.

1216
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,964
- [chuckles softly]
- You're kind of far away.

1217
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,257
[groans] Yeah.

1218
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,009
[sighs]

1219
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,139
Hey, thank you for your shirt, also,
by the way.

1220
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,557
Oh, yeah, no problem.

1221
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,393
- [Sean] It's comfortable. It smells good.
- Looks great on you.

1222
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,311
Thanks.

1223
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,279
Hey, um, you know what? Uh...

1224
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,242
Remember at the <i>Rent </i>cast party?

1225
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:39,331
- Mm-hmm?
- I actually had a crush on you, too.

1226
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,879
[sighs]

1227
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,839
You... you did?

1228
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,258
Yeah.

1229
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,470
Yeah, also momentarily.

1230
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:55,973
- Um...
- Right.

1231
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:57,766
Yeah, I mean...

1232
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,476
I don't know.

1233
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,359
Wow, the Fuck King?

1234
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,154
- [chuckles softly]
- The Fuck... Are you the Fuck King?

1235
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,074
Uh, no, that's not me.
I'm not the Fuck King.

1236
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,576
- Just a fuck prince.
- I wouldn't even...

1237
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,412
I think I'm more of a jester.

1238
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,663
- You're a fuck jester.
- Yeah.

1239
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,289
That's... that's more fun.

1240
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,418
You wanted to use it at the hospital here?

1241
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,336
Well... Um...

1242
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,422
[clicks tongue]

1243
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:32,718
Jeremy actually gave it to me
to use with you.

1244
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,179
- And I said, "That's crazy."
- That's really weird.

1245
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,682
- [Sean] I'm on the same page. It's weird.
- I'm his sister.

1246
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,100
So it's not really mine.

1247
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,269
- Ew! Ew!
- I know! I know!

1248
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,229
- Why?
- Yeah.

1249
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,481
- The Fuck King? Come on.
- I know. It's weird.

1250
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,277
I mean, it's not like you still
have a crush on me.

1251
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,948
Do you still have a crush on me?

1252
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,661
- [woman] Excuse me.
- Wha...

1253
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,830
Come with me.
The doctor would like to see you.

1254
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,416
- [Becky] Okay, yeah, great. Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

1255
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,335
[Becky] Um... Donnie. Hey.

1256
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,671
The doctor wants to see us. Let's go.

1257
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,007
- Okay.
- Were you just...

1258
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,300
God damn.

1259
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,512
- Sean. Let's go.
- Yeah.

1260
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,558
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my...
Yeah, I'm on my way.

1261
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,270
- What's your problem?
- [Sean] Nothing.

1262
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,273
I lost something. I can't remember...

1263
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:29,691
if I...

1264
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,403
- Sean, do you have a boner?
- I don't have a boner.

1265
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,988
Just my back hurts, and...

1266
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:36,406
So...

1267
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:40,452
basically every time you touch Sean,
he gets a raging bonie.

1268
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,915
See? I told you. You give him boners.

1269
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:45,874
[Sean] What?

1270
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,251
I don't have a bonie.

1271
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,419
[seat squeaks]

1272
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,589
Did you just fart?

1273
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,673
No, it was the seat.

1274
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,093
Oh, my God. Do you have the farts
and a boner?

1275
00:59:56,176 --> 01:00:00,555
- I don't have farts or a boner. [scoffs]
- [Sarah] One of those is a lie.

1276
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,934
- Let's... You got it. You got it.
- Do you, buddy.

1277
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,186
- Thank you.
- Shocking, man.

1278
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,187
Thanks.

1279
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:10,982
[seat squeaks]

1280
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,569
[grunts, inhales sharply]

1281
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,952
Good news. Surgery went perfectly.

1282
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,328
- [sighs]
- Oh, my God.

1283
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,996
Well, not perfectly.

1284
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,873
But as good as we could have hoped.

1285
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,335
We have a successful reattachment,
and your friend's gonna be fine.

1286
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,712
What about the snake venom?

1287
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,422
There was no venom in the penis.

1288
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,675
Yeah, man. You sucked that shit out.

1289
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,760
- [both whoop]
- [doctor] No.

1290
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,930
- There was <i>never </i>any venom in the penis.
- Huh?

1291
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,391
It's impossible to suck venom
out of a bite wound.

1292
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,726
It was a defensive bite.

1293
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,061
Whatever, man.

1294
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,772
- Don't listen. He doesn't know shit.
- Yeah.

1295
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:52,399
Right. I'm just a doctor.

1296
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,486
Anyway, your friend whose dick you sucked
for no reason

1297
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,865
is gonna be under a bit longer,
but you can go in and see him.

1298
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,367
Sure he'd love to wake up
to some friendly faces.

1299
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:04,911
Salty.

1300
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,957
- [sighs]
- [chuckles nervously]

1301
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,916
Here we go.

1302
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,168
All right.

1303
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:12,919
[Becky] Let's do it.

1304
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:25,932
Who's this?

1305
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,312
Um, hi, excuse me. Nurse.

1306
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:33,982
The doctor told us the wrong room.
We're looking for Jeremy Abelar.

1307
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,401
Jeremy... Abelar.

1308
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,113
No, we don't have a Jeremy Abelar
in recovery.

1309
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:43,241
The doctor told us that he transferred
from surgery.

1310
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:46,119
Let's make this simpler. It's the guy
that got his wiener reattached.

1311
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,580
Yeah. That's him. Reginald Knudson.

1312
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,124
- No, no, no.
- The other person for a severed penis.

1313
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,042
Yeah.

1314
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:52,959
[chuckles]

1315
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:57,088
If there was somebody else here
with a severed penis, trust me, I'd know.

1316
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1317
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:02,135
If... if Jeremy's not here, then...

1318
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,138
We gave someone else Jeremy's penis.

1319
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,556
[Sean] What?

1320
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,934
That's our friend's dick?

1321
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,685
That's our friend's dick.

1322
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,396
- That's our friend's dick! Oh, my God.
- That right?

1323
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,565
- What kind of fucking hospital is this?
- Security!

1324
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,651
[groans]

1325
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,237
- You have my friend's penis.
- [nurse grunts]

1326
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,656
[Donnie] Hang on for one second.
It's a simple mistake.

1327
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,867
It's an honest mistake, I'm sure.
But you guys have the wrong penis, okay?

1328
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,619
You have the wrong penis and...

1329
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,581
[groans] You all saw that!
You're witnesses!

1330
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,166
- Are you okay?
- That's a felony!

1331
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,086
All right, we need to figure out
if there's a head of the hospital

1332
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,380
and explain the situation and see if...

1333
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,091
And what?
They'll just grow him another dick

1334
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,926
with their magic dick-making machine?

1335
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,261
- [sighs]
- [Donnie grunts]

1336
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,681
- I'm not just gonna give up.
- You have no idea where Jeremy is.

1337
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,599
It's pretty obvious we're done.

1338
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,725
That's awesome, Donnie.

1339
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,186
Sarah, I'm sorry.
Can you tell your boyfriend or whatever

1340
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,605
to stop throwing a little baby boy
tantrum right now.

1341
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,943
Maybe I should be more like you.
Right? Manipulate things.

1342
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:03,655
Make 'em go my way.
Like what you did with the medevac.

1343
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,074
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you talking about?

1344
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,661
Uh, while your brother was lying there,
maybe about to die, uh...

1345
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,540
Sean was pretending to be you
and texting Chad from your phone.

1346
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,834
[Becky] Sean.

1347
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,877
Sea... Sean?

1348
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,796
Are you serious?

1349
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,258
- You...
- It was... It was an accident. I was...

1350
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,969
How is texting my boyfriend
as me an accident?

1351
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,721
You guys weren't even
technically together.

1352
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,390
What? What? What did you say?
What did you say to him?

1353
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,020
I said, "Fuck you. We're done."
And then I called him "dirty taint."

1354
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,480
Wow.

1355
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,566
- Yeah.
- Um, okay.

1356
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,526
The... the voicemail?

1357
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:45,196
[sighs] The voicemail he sent me.

1358
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:49,284
I, um... I need to... I need to go.
[sniffles]

1359
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,829
- I'm sorry. I need to borrow your phone.
- No. What the hell?

1360
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,706
You do not want to fuck with me
right now!

1361
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,960
Just messaging Chad
and telling him to pick me up.

1362
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,378
Becky...

1363
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,217
[Becky] Of course, he's online. Okay.

1364
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,886
He's coming to pick me up.

1365
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:09,137
Thank you.

1366
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:10,847
Sarah, let's go.

1367
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:21,483
Becky! Becky! [sighs]

1368
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,609
Becky.

1369
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,321
Use the twin connection.

1370
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,448
Find me.

1371
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,243
If you can hear me, please hurry up
and come and save me.

1372
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:33,286
[clears throat]

1373
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,204
Becky!

1374
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,498
Nope, it's me Darlene. Hello.

1375
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,375
Um, so...

1376
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,418
we got you an operating room.

1377
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,669
I'm telling you, lady.

1378
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,171
My friends are close.

1379
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:45,882
And I'm telling you, it doesn't matter
if they're close.

1380
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:50,845
By now, unless your penis somehow got
fresh, oxygenated blood in it,

1381
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,264
it's dead.

1382
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:57,560
No, no, no, no! Don't. [sobs]

1383
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:58,645
Oh, my God.

1384
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:02,816
There's no point in waiting any longer
for trash to arrive.

1385
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:05,360
[sighs] Okay, fine.

1386
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,779
Let's do the butt-skin dick.

1387
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,906
A graft is no longer an option.

1388
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,533
- What?
- Do you smell that?

1389
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,327
You know we don't serve blue cheese
in the cafeteria, right?

1390
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,495
That... that is...

1391
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,288
That's your hole.

1392
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:18,665
I'm sorry.

1393
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,043
The anesthesiologist will be in shortly.

1394
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,924
Wow. So this is really happening.

1395
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:34,013
I can't believe I shat on your chances
with Becky.

1396
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,725
[sighs] Yeah, it's my own fault.
I'm a fucking idiot.

1397
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,352
Uh, no.

1398
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:44,566
Also, I'm really sorry I started the rumor
about you going to rehab for bath salts.

1399
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,067
What? That was you?

1400
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,195
I feel like we both now know
I have problems with abandonment.

1401
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,405
- Yep.
- [man] I can't believe

1402
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,157
I found a dick in the sewer.

1403
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:55,535
Believe it, young'un.
You just got your dick cherry popped.

1404
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,828
Gonna need a new cooler.

1405
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:58,830
- [man] Fuck.
- [Donnie] Dude.

1406
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:02,208
- [Sean] Yo. Yo, yo, yo.
- They have the redneck's dick.

1407
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:03,835
If...

1408
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,296
we can get it to the doctor...

1409
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:11,509
then the doctor can reattach it
and we can get Jeremy's penis back.

1410
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,470
We haven't been good friends
to each other.

1411
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,847
- I feel like I've been a good friend...
- But...

1412
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,807
we can be best friends for Jeremy.

1413
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:19,601
Let's do it.

1414
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,277
- [door shuts]
- [monitor beeping]

1415
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,697
Hey, man.

1416
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:34,407
Who the hell are you?

1417
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,952
- I said no visitors.
- Uh, I'm really sorry.

1418
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,788
There's something that you should know
about...

1419
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:42,874
your penis.

1420
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,710
Er, I mean, it's not <i>your </i>penis...

1421
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,171
You have our friend Jeremy's penis.

1422
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,256
What the hell are you talking about?

1423
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,842
- They put our friend's penis on you.
- Yes, they did.

1424
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:57,055
Like, not like when I was out,
they put your friend's dick on my face...

1425
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,183
I don't know, maybe that happened.
But then they sewed it on you.

1426
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,481
You're gonna see right away
it's our friend Jeremy's penis.

1427
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,609
[gasps] Oh, my God.

1428
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,402
That is not my dick.

1429
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,238
That's not your dick.
It's what I said.

1430
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:15,907
Why? Why? Why is it so ugly?

1431
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,534
- [Sean] Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

1432
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,119
Where did they find this?
A little Navajo boy?

1433
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,454
It's a normal-looking dick.

1434
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,581
Once the swelling goes down,
it's gonna get smaller?

1435
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:26,876
Are you fucking kidding me?
How am I supposed to work with this?

1436
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:30,713
Ugh. You two again? Hey!
Am I gonna have to call security?

1437
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,632
Oh, hey, it's Dr. Malpractice.

1438
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,301
Guess what? You sewed the wrong dick
onto the wrong body.

1439
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,762
If you don't want us to fuck
your world up, you listen.

1440
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:41,140
Two water sanitation workers just came
into the hospital with his dick.

1441
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,351
- What? My real penis is here?
- Yeah, man.

1442
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,562
[Donnie] What we need you to do
is reattach 'em.

1443
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:49,774
Guys... [scoffs]
You don't just pop 'em on and off.

1444
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,609
It's a delicate operation.

1445
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,486
It's not a fucking LEGO set.

1446
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,322
That dick is staying on that body.

1447
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,617
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm stuck with this...

1448
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,620
- this thing?
- Hey, man.

1449
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:03,871
That thing...

1450
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:05,790
that fucking thing...

1451
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,502
belonged to a goddamn majestic person.

1452
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,337
And you need to respect

1453
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:14,632
that you got a part of my friend
on you now forever.

1454
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:17,051
Okay? You got a piece of Jeremy.

1455
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,636
It's a good dick.

1456
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,473
You need to honor that penis.

1457
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:26,686
And bring it as much joy
as Jeremy brings us

1458
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,688
every time you take it out.

1459
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,274
Because it belonged to a great dude.

1460
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,191
The best.

1461
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,903
You guys seem like
some really good friends.

1462
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,616
I wish I would have listened to my buddies

1463
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:42,327
when they told me
that Cheryl was a psycho bitch.

1464
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,078
Never would have let her tie me up.

1465
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,414
I thought she just wanted to get freaky.

1466
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,208
- Maybe do some butt stuff.
- That's awesome.

1467
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,501
Anything goes, you know?

1468
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:54,631
She put on her sexy little
Juicy Cooter slip.

1469
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,593
Got my rod all hard.

1470
01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,594
Cool.

1471
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,388
She started licking all up in my ear,
you know.

1472
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,391
Saying sexy sweet nothings and whatnot.

1473
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,769
And she leans in and she whispers...

1474
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,564
"I know about you and my sister."

1475
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:16,944
Yeah, and then she whips out
a pair of scissors... and bam!

1476
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,822
She snips my dick clean off.

1477
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,574
- Yep.
- And then she flushed it.

1478
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,494
- [gags]
- She flushed my pee-pee like a poo-poo.

1479
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:27,246
She sounds like one bag of trash.

1480
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,247
[Reginald] Yep.

1481
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,333
You know what the craziest part is?

1482
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,671
I still love her.

1483
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,214
There it is.

1484
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,592
You know, I know it's just
a dirty toilet dick but, doctor...

1485
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:44,722
I'd like to give these two young men
my old penis.

1486
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,892
- That's awesome.
- You know, that might work.

1487
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,686
Yeah. Because...

1488
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:54,649
everybody deserves a second chance.

1489
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,734
[woman, crying] Even me?

1490
01:09:58,486 --> 01:09:59,362
Cheryl.

1491
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:03,241
Oh, baby. I'm sorry, baby.

1492
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,243
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1493
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,204
No, baby, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was doing.

1494
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,790
I don't know what I was thinking.

1495
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:15,753
I just went in. I... I grabbed 'em
and I snipped it.

1496
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:18,840
You got through it real easy, too.
I was surprised.

1497
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,466
Can you ever forgive me?

1498
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,927
If I could suck it back on, I would.

1499
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,513
I know it was the drugs.
I know it was the drugs.

1500
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,223
You know it was the drugs.

1501
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,725
- Baby.
- Yeah?

1502
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,853
- And how about a little kiss?
- [Reginald] Yeah, okay. [pants]

1503
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,522
That feels good.
Little kisses of an angel.

1504
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,400
- Yeah. It's okay.
- Oh, my God.

1505
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,279
- Baby. Oh, I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

1506
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,447
- Let's go.
- Oh, Jesus.

1507
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,533
- [Cheryl] You're my king.
- [Reginald] The scepter has been repaired.

1508
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,827
[Cheryl] When's little Reggie
gonna be ready for me to...

1509
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,037
Hey, guys! Guys, guys! Look...

1510
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,624
I think they can attach Reginald's penis
to your friend.

1511
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,420
Okay? It's in the cold storage.
One floor up, end of the hall.

1512
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,005
Take my key card.

1513
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,883
- Why aren't you coming?
- "Why aren't you coming?"

1514
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,052
How about I don't want to get sued?
If they ask, I'll tell them you stole it.

1515
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,430
Wow. That's so great of you.
You're so nice.

1516
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,307
- [groans]
- [Donnie] Oh!

1517
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,224
Oh, <i>Scheiße!</i>

1518
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:11,809
What the fuck did you do that for?

1519
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,562
So they believe we stole the key card.
I don't know.

1520
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,315
I have a super fucking sensitive nose,
you guys.

1521
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,234
- [Cheryl exclaims]
- [Reginald, screaming] Why? Why?

1522
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,986
Oh, my God!

1523
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,447
- Holy shi...
- Oh, my God!

1524
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:25,364
She cut it off again!

1525
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:29,827
I did, 'cause you don't deserve no cock,
you cheating son of a bitch.

1526
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,288
Oh, you fucking crazy ho bag!

1527
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,582
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! We need that!
- It's my cock!

1528
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,083
It's my dick. [grunts]

1529
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:40,087
- [laughing, grunting]
- [grunts]

1530
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,340
- [doctor] Jesus!
- Oh!

1531
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,467
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna cut it up

1532
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,719
like a little three-year-old's lunch.

1533
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,847
- She will do it. Trust me.
- [Cheryl] I'll do it. I'm crazy!

1534
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,599
- [hisses]
- [Sean] Oh! You're crazy, lady!

1535
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:53,851
[Cheryl grunts, yelps]

1536
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,520
Ow! Where'd she go?

1537
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,647
- [panting] Where is she?
- [screams]

1538
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,023
Oh, my God. [screams]

1539
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,734
- Oh, fuck!
- What the fuck?

1540
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:05,530
I don't care how many times
you reattach it, Reggie.

1541
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,950
I'm gonna find you, I'm gonna cut it off,

1542
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:12,537
and I'm gonna flush it every time.

1543
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,747
- Don't you dare.
- [Sean] Get it, Donnie! Get it, Donnie!

1544
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,082
[Reginald] She'll do it.

1545
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,502
- [Donnie] Cheryl, give me that.
- [Cheryl screaming]

1546
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,212
- [Donnie groans]
- [groans]

1547
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,006
- [crunches]
- [screams]

1548
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,676
- Oh!
- [Donnie groans]

1549
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,219
[screaming]

1550
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,930
- Blow it down! Blow the dick down.
- [splashing]

1551
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,181
[Donnie gurgling]

1552
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:33,891
I got you now.

1553
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:38,479
- Whoa! Whoa! [grunts]
- [yells]

1554
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,273
- Wait a minute, baby!
- What?

1555
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,691
[crying] I love you.

1556
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,903
I love you too, Reggie.
Why do you think I'm doing all this?

1557
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,321
- Security!
- [yells]

1558
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,906
- [grunts]
- [groans]

1559
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,534
- [Cheryl] Mission accomplished, bitch!
- God damn it!

1560
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,119
- [gurgling]
- [Sean] Oh!

1561
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,124
[crying]
It was just supposed to be camping.

1562
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,753
- Oh, fuck.
- I'm gonna pick it up.

1563
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:06,340
I'm gonna flip it like dog poop. [grunts]

1564
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,847
Well, boys, I guess you get your wish.
You got your friend's dick back.

1565
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,974
Thanks! Let's go. Come on.

1566
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,309
Good luck, boys!

1567
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,019
Oh, shit.

1568
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,354
- [monitor alarm beeps]
- [sputtering]

1569
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,106
You okay?

1570
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,237
- Oh, hey, it's the girls. It's the girls.
- What?

1571
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,074
Hey.

1572
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,243
What's going on?

1573
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:36,871
We... we have Jeremy's penis. [chuckles]

1574
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,831
Thought it got sewn on to that other guy.

1575
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,791
- Oh, it... It did.
- Well, yeah.

1576
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,501
- [car honking]
- [stereo playing]

1577
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:49,258
'Sup, babe?

1578
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:50,718
[scoffs] It's fucking Chad.

1579
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,188
Here. Take... take it. [sighs]

1580
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,359
I know you're done with me,
but the receptionist said

1581
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,444
there are five other hospitals
Jeremy could be in.

1582
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:12,865
We're gonna drive around and call around
and see if we can find out where he is.

1583
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:15,368
And if we figure it out before you...

1584
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,538
I will text you. I'll text... Chad.

1585
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,416
As me this time, not as you.

1586
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,170
Do it.

1587
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:30,216
You know what, I am really sorry
that I sent that text.

1588
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,551
But you deserve to be with somebody
who respects you.

1589
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,306
Not somebody who cheats on you.

1590
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,270
You're amazing, and I really like you.

1591
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:44,939
And I've always liked you.

1592
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,693
[stammering] And not...
always... I haven't...

1593
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,320
I don't, like, like you like a lot.
Like a lot, a lot.

1594
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,906
I just think you're cool,
and I think you think I'm cool,

1595
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,867
and that we're cool together.
And it's cool that we...

1596
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,619
have this thing and...

1597
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,372
You know, I am not trying to make...
[stammers]

1598
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,833
[coughing]

1599
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,464
God. Oh, no, no, no, no.
No. No, no, no.

1600
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:12,758
Don't worry, I put it in a baggie
like dog shit.

1601
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,677
[Becky] It's still pretty gross.

1602
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,470
- Ugh.
- [coughs] Sorry.

1603
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:19,765
Ugh.

1604
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,268
[sighs]

1605
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,771
Anyway, I'm really sorry
about everything and...

1606
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,150
I hope that you can forgive me.

1607
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,403
[exhales deeply] Yeah.

1608
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,532
- [sighs]
- [horn honks]

1609
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,326
- Come on down, babe. Let's go.
- [Becky] Great.

1610
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:40,745
One sec.

1611
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,748
Why the fuck did I message Chad?

1612
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:46,584
Come on. Let's go.

1613
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,254
- We're going to save Jeremy.
- [Sarah sighs]

1614
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,216
You guys coming or...

1615
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,845
What? So, my speech was good?

1616
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,096
[scoffs] No.

1617
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:02,266
But, hey,
I think I got what you were trying to say.

1618
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,145
You messed up. You're sorry.
I deserve respect.

1619
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,730
We like each other.

1620
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:09,815
Yeah.

1621
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:11,025
I got it.

1622
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:15,946
- Cool.
- Let's go get Jeremy his dick back.

1623
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,240
- [both] Yeah!
- Whoo!

1624
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,912
- 'Sup, babe?
- Sorry, Chad, we're broken up. Bye.

1625
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,790
- [Donnie] 'Sup, Chad?
- What the fuck? Are you serious?

1626
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,333
I drove all the way out here!

1627
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,918
Your loss, Becky.

1628
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:32,254
I even got a fake ID
so we could drink margaritas in Cancun.

1629
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,257
- Wait. Holy shit. Stop the car.
- What?

1630
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,884
- [Sarah] What?
- Stop the car. Stop.

1631
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,719
- I know how to find Jeremy.
- How?

1632
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,013
Jeremy bought us booze on the drive
out to the mountains.

1633
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,056
So, what?

1634
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:45,101
The military ID was the one in his wallet.
His fake!

1635
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,979
Oh! The hospital admitted him
under the name on his fake ID.

1636
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:52,233
- Jack motherfucking Jessop!
- [all laughing]

1637
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,484
What the fuck?

1638
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,194
- [Donnie] Holy shit.
- I'm calling it in.

1639
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:58,197
- Which hospital? You said there were five.
- East General. The first place.

1640
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,200
- [phone ringing]
- East General Hospital?

1641
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:05,579
Hi, can you connect us to Jack Jessop,
please?

1642
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:06,622
One moment.

1643
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,251
[keyboard clacking over phone]

1644
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,755
[nurse] <i>And connecting you now.</i>

1645
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,216
- Yes.
- Yes! No, yes!

1646
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,802
[all laughing]

1647
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,137
[man] Just relax.

1648
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,639
And count back from 100.

1649
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,975
We'll be back shortly to take you
into the OR.

1650
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,811
[phone ringing]

1651
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,190
[grunts softly]

1652
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,194
- Hello?
- Jeremy!

1653
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:38,154
Jeremy!

1654
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,781
