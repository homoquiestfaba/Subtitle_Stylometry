1
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:30,255
You walk here?

2
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,173
Alright, good. Turn around.

3
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:38,518
Legs out.

4
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,147
The bag.

5
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,048
Gotta still hit the
farmers' market.

6
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,591
- What time is it?
- 10:00-ish.

7
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:02,134
- It's 10:00?
- Mm-hm.

8
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,470
I gotta pick up the kid.
Where's Tony?

9
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:07,765
Tony and I were out late last night.
But don't worry, he's gonna be here.

10
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,308
- You got this?
- Yes.

11
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:11,384
He's not gonna flake. Neither am I.

12
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:16,148
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

13
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:17,899
- Yes, Chef.
- Wake up.

14
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:19,484
We got a critic coming today.

15
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:21,403
Why you think I slept
here for, bro?

16
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:23,905
Let's get going on the soup.
We're behind on the egg prep.

17
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:25,991
And get the mise on the steak.
You still shitfaced?

18
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:27,617
- No, I'm good. I'm good, Chef.
- Alright.

19
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,744
Help Martin with the pig.
We got the pig.

20
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:31,820
Lechon!

21
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:39,403
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

22
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:43,258
Buckle up, buddy. Sorry I'm late.

23
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,009
I'm used to it.

24
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,679
Listen, pal, I don't think we
have time to catch a movie today.

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,806
Is it 'cause you're
getting reviewed?

26
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:52,600
- Yeah, how'd you know about that?
- Mom told me.

27
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,227
What'd she say?

28
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:56,396
She said you might
be a little worried.

29
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:58,397
- She said I was worried?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,942
Well, Mom doesn't know
me that well, OK?

31
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:03,402
- She's pretty spot-on about you.
- Oh, yeah?

32
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:05,321
You know what Mommy
thinks I should be doing?

33
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:06,989
- What?
- That I should get a food truck.

34
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,908
- I like food trucks.
- Yeah, I like food trucks.

35
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,451
Who doesn't like food trucks?

36
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,787
Can you picture me driving
a food truck? I'm a chef.

37
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:14,997
- I work in a restaurant.
- OK.

38
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:17,833
Listen, I gotta go to the farmers'
market, pick up some ingredients.

39
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:20,377
OK. Can I come?

40
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:22,296
I thought I'd drop you
off at the restaurant.

41
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:23,964
- Molly's there.
- No, I wanna go with you.

42
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:25,966
- You're not gonna ask me
for everything you see?
- No.

43
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,968
It's not about you eating,
it's about me buying groceries.

44
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:29,470
- I know.
- OK. Good.

45
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,138
- You got the purple and white?
- Just orange.

46
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,056
Just orange? Alright, give
me six bunches of those.

47
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:34,600
- Or eight of the small.
- Dad.

48
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,769
Hang on a second, buddy. And on the
radishes here, I use the tops, OK?

49
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,313
- I need consistent tops.
- Dad.

50
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:41,815
Is that what's happening?
Six of these. Let's see what we got.

51
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:43,358
- Dad.
- What do you want, Percy?

52
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,652
- Can I please have kettle corn?
- Daddy's working, OK?

53
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:47,195
No, you're not gonna get kettle...

54
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:49,698
- Why don't you get a piece of fruit?
- I don't want fruit.

55
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,409
How can you even ask for kettle corn?
You know what it is?

56
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,036
- No.
- It's carbs covered with sugar, OK?

57
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:56,788
Look at this piece of fruit.

58
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,498
Huh? It's beautiful.

59
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,041
How could you even want kettle corn

60
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,960
with gorgeous fruit like
this in front of you?

61
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,670
Why don't you have
a piece of fruit?

62
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,714
So apparently they're
sending a big reviewer

63
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,675
who's also some huge food blogger.

64
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:10,843
- You know what a food blogger is?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:13,304
A guy who writes about
food on the internet.

66
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,014
I know what a food blogger is.

67
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:18,559
Well, this guy's a big one,
and a lot of these big guys,

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,103
they don't like me.

69
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:23,272
They got it in for me because I got
good write-ups when I started out.

70
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:26,317
- They're haters.
- Exactly.

71
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:28,402
We didn't have that word
when I was growing up.

72
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:29,946
There was no word for hater.

73
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,281
The most you would say is that
somebody was, like, jealous,

74
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:33,824
which didn't really capture it.

75
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:36,118
The sausage guy's here.
You ever try andouille sausage?

76
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,661
- No.
- It's spicy.

77
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:39,163
- You like spicy?
- No.

78
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:41,192
It's not so spicy. Come on.

79
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,585
That's from New Orleans.
You ever heard of New Orleans?

80
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,128
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

81
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:47,671
It's part of the United States.

82
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:50,424
It's part of the Louisiana
Purchase from Napoleon.

83
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:52,009
Yeah. Um, that was...

84
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,928
I mean, like, now. That
was a long time ago.

85
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:57,598
- 1803.
- Whatever.

86
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,809
Talking about the food,
the culture, you know?

87
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,270
Like this andouille sausage.

88
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:05,939
- Beignets. You ever hear of that?
- We can get it here.

89
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,482
Not the same.

90
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:09,985
When you have it here, it's
good because it reminds you of,

91
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:13,029
like, a whole world of memories
that you have of being there.

92
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,032
'Cause it's like... I'm telling you,
it's like a whole different world.

93
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:18,201
- We should go there sometime.
- Definitely.

94
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,203
- For real?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:21,955
I mean, not now.

96
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,498
- But, like...
- When?

97
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:26,405
I don't know. I got...
Everything's very full for me.

98
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,629
- I got this reviewer coming.
- After the review?

99
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,965
Yeah, after review. That'd be good.

100
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,675
I'm off school next month.

101
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:35,885
Next month? Yeah.
We could go next month.

102
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:37,428
- Awesome.
- Or whatever. Or, like, if you're...

103
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:38,971
If it doesn't... I'll ask Mom.

104
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,057
If it doesn't work out next
month, we'll go later.

105
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:44,343
- But we'll definitely check it out.
- I already did. She's cool with it.

106
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:48,022
- You asked her already?
- Mm-hm.

107
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:50,524
Where'd you get a phone? How
come you have a phone already?

108
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,109
Everybody your age have phones?

109
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,153
Yo, Popeye, get the
sauce on there, OK?

110
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,281
Whose bacon is this, huh?
I gotta watch this too?

111
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:00,451
When I find out who it is, grab your
ankles, 'cause here comes papi chulo.

112
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:02,995
Where we at? Talk to me,
people. How we doing?

113
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,080
The stock's simmering, the pig's
broken down, bacon are fine.

114
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:06,915
The stock is simmering.
That means reducing.

115
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:10,127
Good. Guys, big night tonight.
You all know what's happening?

116
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,212
Yeah? OK, let me know
as soon as he's here.

117
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:14,298
I want people having fun
at all the tables around.

118
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:17,217
Call your pretty friends, bring 'em in.
Tell 'em the tickets are on me.

119
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:18,886
The stemware looks crooked.
Let's get out there.

120
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,971
Don't make me get the fucking
ruler out. Thank you.

121
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:22,514
- Oh, Chef.
- I got the good shit.

122
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,599
- You see this, Martin?
- Look at that. That's a specimen.

123
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,518
- Baby carrots.
- I got you curry paste with...

124
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,353
- Copy that. Copy that.
- Carl.

125
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,896
Not right now, please.

126
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:31,815
Where the fuck did you get
these juicy-ass tomatoes?

127
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:34,259
- Riva's here.
- OK, you got it? Let's get...

128
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,570
What the hell's Riva doing here?

129
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:38,655
I don't know. He was
on his way back here.

130
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:40,907
I got him espresso, bought
you five minutes of time.

131
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:42,575
You should meet him
out on the floor.

132
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:45,078
Stall him for five minutes. Let
me get the staff going. Please.

133
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,413
OK. Fine. Expect him
to come back here.

134
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,957
Yeah, thank you.

135
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,042
How you gonna keep that
psychopath from coming back here?

136
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,378
- You gotta have a plan.
- You want me to pickle these?

137
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,046
Yeah, pickle these.
I want you to pickle...

138
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,589
- Is Carl in there?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,966
Hey, Carl!

140
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,885
Carl.

141
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:04,764
Are you, uh... are you
planning on altering the menu?

142
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:06,807
Yeah, I can't do this right
now. Please, just...

143
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:09,143
- You know a lot is on the line today.
- I know.

144
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:10,811
That's why the menu
has to be perfect.

145
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:13,522
- But I can help you plan it.
- I can't do this right now.

146
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:16,192
Give me five minutes with my staff,
I'll walk you through the menu.

147
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:18,069
I've done this before.
I can help guide you.

148
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,355
I don't need guidance
right now. I need space.

149
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:23,449
OK?

150
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,525
Thank you.

151
00:07:26,453 --> 00:07:29,525
Could we have a little
privacy, uh, guys?

152
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,249
Huh?

153
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,942
I ask you to leave,
you gotta look at Carl?

154
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:38,172
OK, everybody, tomen cinco.
Take five.

155
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:42,843
- You good?
- I got it. Go, go, go.

156
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:45,002
Grab a coffee.

157
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:47,347
- Let's get something straight.
- Yeah.

158
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:50,267
You don't fucking talk to my
staff like that. I talk to my staff.

159
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:52,602
That side of the pass is
you, this side is me.

160
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:54,312
That was the arrangement
when you hired me.

161
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:56,398
OK, now will you listen
to me for a minute?

162
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,359
Carl, I get ideas.
Sometimes my ideas work.

163
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,029
I really don't care what magazine
said that you're the next big thing.

164
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,616
The fact is, you work for me,
in my restaurant, right?

165
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:08,535
I've had chefs before
you in this kitchen.

166
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:11,079
- I'll have chefs after you. OK?
- Alright, good talk.

167
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,414
- Let me get back to work.
- You know who's coming tonight.

168
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,833
We're being reviewed by the most
important critic in the city.

169
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:19,629
- Yes. I'm aware.
- His online blog was sold to AOL...

170
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,214
- For $10 million.
- That's right.

171
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,924
- You knew that?
- Yes, I know.

172
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:24,509
- OK.
- He's a big deal.

173
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,762
- That's why I wanna cook a good menu.
- You wanna cook a good menu?

174
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:30,264
- I wanna cook him some good food.
- Yeah. Well, then...

175
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,642
And our place is in a
fucking creative rut.

176
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,727
- In a rut?
- In a creative rut.

177
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,229
You do know we're doing better than
any place in the neighbourhood?

178
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,148
I'm not talking about how
much money we're making,

179
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:41,066
I'm talking about creatively...
the food that we're serving.

180
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:42,735
We've served the same
food for five years.

181
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,862
Remember what happened when
you put guts on the menu?

182
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:47,323
Are you talking about my sweetbreads?
Is that what you mean?

183
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:50,159
Yeah. When you put that artsy shit
on the menu, people don't like it.

184
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,162
Not one person ordered
your sweetbreads.

185
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:54,747
Please listen to me.

186
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:58,250
I sank a fortune into the remodel
to get you the French cooking top,

187
00:08:58,251 --> 00:08:59,793
whatever it is, that tabletop.

188
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:01,336
- French cooking suite.
- Right.

189
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:03,630
Not every chef gets that.
You know why you get it?

190
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,132
- I appreciate it.
- Do you know why?

191
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,675
Because you deserve it.

192
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,802
See, you don't know that.
But I know it.

193
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,470
You deserve it.

194
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,514
So be smart just for tonight.

195
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:14,558
Look, if you bought Stones tickets

196
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,353
and Jagger didn't play
'Satisfaction', how would you feel?

197
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:20,146
Would you be happy?

198
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,690
- No.
- No!

199
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,632
You'd burn the place
to the fucking ground.

200
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:28,571
Your menu works.

201
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:30,850
People love it.

202
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,786
Carl, do what you want tonight.
OK? You're the chef.

203
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,746
You know what I think?

204
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,905
I think you should play your hits.

205
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,297
Alright, let's go. Pre-shift, guys.

206
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,174
Big night tonight.

207
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:50,301
Here's what we're doing.

208
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:52,720
We're gonna go with the favourites.

209
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:55,164
Starting with the caviar egg...

210
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,880
scallop, French onion soup...

211
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:01,469
frisée salad...

212
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:04,216
lobster risotto...

213
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,525
filet.

214
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,736
And we're gonna finish
strong with a crowd pleaser,

215
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:10,863
chocolate lava cake.

216
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:13,365
Talk to Molly about wine pairings.

217
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:15,701
Let me know when he gets here.
And let's have fun.

218
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:18,203
Put your heart in it, people,
big night. Let's have some fun.

219
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:20,279
Good, good.

220
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:32,592
<i>I'm so tired of being alone</i>

221
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,345
<i>I'm so tired of on-my-own</i>

222
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:42,769
<i>Won't you help me, girl,
just as soon as you can?</i>

223
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,857
<i>People say that I've found a way</i>

224
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:54,322
<i>To make you say that you love me</i>

225
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:57,116
<i>Hey, baby, you didn't go for that</i>

226
00:10:57,117 --> 00:11:00,142
<i>It's a natural fact</i>

227
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:02,747
<i>That I wanna come back</i>

228
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:05,321
<i>Show me where it's at</i>

229
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,085
<i>Baby, yeah</i>

230
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:11,464
<i>I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired...</i>

231
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:13,424
Dad.

232
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,509
Dad.

233
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,416
Dad! Come on. Let's go.

234
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:28,439
Look! It's up, it's up. It's up,
it's up. The review's up.

235
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,065
To the review. Here we go.

236
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,734
- To you, baby, to you.
- Here we go.

237
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:33,893
- My culinary hero.
- To the team.

238
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:38,198
"Gauloises - eager to please."

239
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,825
- Whoo!
- Yes!

240
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:42,119
"10 years ago, I had the
good fortune to dine

241
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,330
"at Chef Casper's revelatory
Miami bistro, Marrow."

242
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,957
- Miami in the house!
- Marrow, baby!

243
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,500
That's your house!

244
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:52,879
"The sheer audacity of this fresh,
brave voice of the culinary scene

245
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,550
"reminded me why I write
about food as a vocation."

246
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:58,468
- Yeah!
- That's a lot of pressure.

247
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,846
"It is nearly impossible to separate
my glowing regard for Chef Casper

248
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:06,101
"and how much he inspired me from my
expectations as I sat down to dine

249
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,437
"at the recently remodelled
Brentwood Gallic staple, Gauloises."

250
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:13,008
- Yeah, this is good!
- "Oh, how times have changed.

251
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,613
"Over the last decade, Carl Casper has
somehow managed to transform himself

252
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,907
"from the edgiest chef in Miami

00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:25,119

you $5 every time you see her

"in hopes that you will like her,

255
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:29,665
"but instead causes you to
shrink from her cloying embrace

00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,115
"which threatens to smother you

country club brunch crowd,

"is the caviar egg.

"A shirred egg topped
with a dollop of caviar

261
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,641
"is an excuse for the
chef to overcharge us

262
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,094
"for his insecurity and
lack of imagination.

00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,858

00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,330
Two stars.

274
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,018
I don't get it. I don't get it.

275
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,312
Everyone loved it.
He loved it, even.

276
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,774
Then Why'd he write all that mean
shit about me? About my food?

277
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,318
Who cares? Who cares?

278
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,986
I do. 'Cause I could
have done better.

279
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,072
I should have cooked the
shit I was gonna cook.

280
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,076
You're ignoring the fact
that everyone was happy

281
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,621
and you're making a problem
where there's no problem.

282
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,247
It's not hard to make people happy.

283
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:56,000
There's certain things you could put on
a menu that'll make everybody happy.

284
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,669
If you put ahi tuna on a
menu, it will sell out.

285
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,463
It's guaranteed. You know that.

286
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,090
But I cooked the beef cheek,
which is a better dish,

287
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:04,633
and nobody wants to even try it.

288
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:07,178
- It was good, though.
- Yeah, for family meal.

289
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,804
Well, who you cooking for, though?

290
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:10,723
That's my point.
Why do I have to pick?

291
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,767
Why do I have to choose?
Why can't I have both?

292
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:16,854
There are chefs that cook
food that they believe in

293
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,648
and people will try because
they're open to a new experience

294
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:21,233
and they'll end up liking it.

295
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,569
- What do you want me to say to you?
- The truth.

296
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,904
You want me to tell you
that you're the best chef

297
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,739
that I ever worked with.

298
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,616
And it's true, because you are.

299
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:32,119
You are, Carl. You are the best
chef I've ever worked with.

300
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,246
- OK.
- I mean it.

301
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,540
Well, thank you.

302
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,616
You're welcome.

303
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,381
- We both agreed not to do that.
- I know.

304
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,758
Why don't I just
cook you something?

305
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,344
Oh, OK. Fuck it. Let's go.

306
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,116
Mmm!

307
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:56,228
Mom wants to talk to you.

308
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,001
Inez?

309
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:07,587
Inez.

310
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:15,387
Are you OK?

311
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,013
I got two stars.

312
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:19,015
Getting two stars is good, right?

313
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:21,351
I mean, I don't read that
shit normally, but, you know,

314
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,686
then he starts writing all this
personal shit about me and...

315
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:26,022
How many people you got working?
You got, like, 50 people.

316
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:28,358
And Percy's 10 years old.
Does he still need a nanny?

317
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:31,110
He's in school all day. What does
she even do here? Hi, Flora.

318
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,029
- Hi, Mr Carl.
- I mean, what does he need...

319
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,102
- What's she doing here?
- You know that he's hurt, right?

320
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:39,827
Because I was late? I already
apologised to him. We're fine.

321
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:43,622
Late? He waited for you for
one hour alone outside.

322
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:45,291
Well, I didn't realise
it was that long.

323
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,486
It's just... that
was the day that...

324
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,670
You're right.

325
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:52,328
I didn't like what
they wrote about you.

326
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,124
I didn't like it either.

327
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,556
It hurt, alright?

328
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:03,048
You OK?

329
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:07,303
I'm alright.

330
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,523
Good.

331
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,692
I'm gonna make it up to him.

332
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:18,073
- That was fun, right?
- Yeah.

333
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:20,117
- Where you going?
- I gotta work on a menu.

334
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,077
It's still early. Can I watch?

335
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:23,662
Yeah, sorry, it's at work.

336
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:26,081
- I won't get in the way.
- Yeah, I gotta go work.

337
00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:28,250
- OK. 'Bye.
- We'll have fun next week.

338
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:29,334
OK.

339
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:49,621
What the hell are you doing here,
man? What's this madness, huh?

340
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:51,206
- This is crazy.
- Yeah.

341
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:52,749
- You didn't go home, did you?
- No.

342
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,417
- Come here. Check it out.
- Go home, man.

343
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:56,336
- You've been here all night. Go home.
- Come here.

344
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,421
Get some sleep. Fuck Twitter.
Come on, get outta here.

345
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:00,340
"Fuck Twitter"? What are you
talking about, "Fuck Twitter"?

346
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:02,425
I mean, you know, fuck 'em.
That's what I mean.

347
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:04,344
- Who reads that shit anyhow?
- I'm not on Twitter.

348
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:05,887
I don't know what
you're talking about.

349
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:08,514
Nothing. Just classic bullshit.
What is that?

350
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,793
- That's carne asada. Check it out.
- Wow.

351
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:14,812
Wow!

352
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:16,856
- Good?
- It's fucking unbelievable, man.

353
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,983
- Is it?
- Holy shit!

354
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:21,068
- No, seriously.
- No, I'm serious.

355
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:22,987
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm telling you the truth.

356
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:24,697
- It's incredible.
- Is it good seasoning?

357
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,240
- The seasoning's perfect.
- Roll that shit!

358
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,200
Chef Big Dog up all night cooking!

359
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,744
- Come on in, buddy.
- Come here.

360
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:32,288
- Tony, check this out.
- Shut up and taste this, amuse douche.

361
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,364
- Come here.
- What we got?

362
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:38,836
- Wow.
- It's good?

363
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:40,879
Huh? Look at that.

364
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,756
- Too much heat?
- That's perfect, Chef.

365
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,341
- It's good? Seasoning?
- Oh, it's perfect.

366
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:45,884
- It's nice and spicy.
- You like it?

367
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,678
- Oh, man.
- Ha, jefe? Look at that.

368
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,930
- I do.
- Yeah?

369
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:51,515
- It's fucking great.
- Is it good?

370
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,183
- Don't fuck with me.
- But it's so good.

371
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:55,352
- See, jefe? I told you.
- It's flavourful as fuck, man.

372
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:57,020
- It's nice, right?
- Umm.

373
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,927
- Is it good?
- Yo, Big Dog, fuck Twitter.

374
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,192
"Fuck Twitter". Again
with the "Fuck Twitter".

375
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:03,735
Why should I fuck Twitter?

376
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,029
- You're not on Twitter?
- No.

377
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,906
You're getting too much pussy?
Is that the problem?

378
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,449
It's gotta be, right?

379
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,117
What does Twitter have
to do with pussy?

380
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:13,745
Have you not heard of the
term 'social networking'?

381
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,288
- Yeah.
- Well, that's what it is.

382
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:17,332
- It means pussy?
- Like, pussy.

383
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,584
Or, like, getting
tickets to something.

384
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,712
- Or finding about a new band.
- Flash mobs. That kind of stuff.

385
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:26,007
- Anything that requires a database.
- So pussy requires a database?

386
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,051
Yeah!

387
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:31,456
So show me what's on Twitter
that's so bad that I should see.

388
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,098
- Oh, shit, is that gochujang?
- Nothing. Nothing.

389
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,726
- Damn, you made fucking gochujang?
- Yeah, that's under the squab.

390
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:39,228
But he's gonna 86 it.
Riva's gonna 86 it, I know.

391
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:41,480
- Yo, this gochujang is good.
- Don't worry about fucking Riva.

392
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:43,399
He ain't gonna let you
serve that Korean shit.

393
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,776
Let me handle him. Don't
worry about that. I got it.

394
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,486
He says I can cook whatever I want.

395
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,405
- Alright. Alright.
- We're gonna cook like this.

396
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:51,198
- Did you try that? Oh, hey.
- Oh, man.

397
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,868
That's broccoli rabe
l'anchois. Check this out.

398
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,703
This is ridiculous.

399
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:58,064
- What you got over there?
- I got...

400
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:52,091
- Mom cuts off the crust.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

401
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:59,098
- It's good.
- You bet your ass it's good.

402
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,725
Can you turn that down, please?

403
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:02,602
Oh, sorry.

404
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:04,512
Arrgh!

405
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,982
You know about Twitter?

406
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:10,307
- Yeah, I have an account.
- Yeah?

407
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:13,320
- How's it work?
- It's cool.

408
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:15,239
It's cool? That's how
it works, it's cool?

409
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,575
- You tweet on it.
- Is that like texting?

410
00:22:17,576 --> 00:22:19,285
No.

411
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:21,829
- Sign me up.
- OK.

412
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:27,167
So, what do you want
your username to be?

413
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:28,711
Carl.

414
00:22:28,712 --> 00:22:31,422
You can't just put Carl.
It has to be 'at something'.

415
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:33,340
At Carl Casper.

416
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:36,413
@CarlCasper.

417
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:39,170
- Taken.
- Someone took my name?

418
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:42,933
@ChefCarlCasper? Is that cool?

419
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:44,684
Yeah, that's good.

420
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:48,054
At... Chef...

421
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:51,233
Carl... Casper.

422
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:53,026
So is this for sex?

423
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:54,945
Eww! Is that what
you're doing this for?

424
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:57,280
No, I'm not doing it for that.
Someone wrote something bad.

425
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,948
I wanna see what they wrote.

426
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,533
Good.

427
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:02,452
Oh, shit.

428
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:04,746
Hey. You can't talk like that.

429
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:07,665
I don't care if Mommy's not around.
I don't want you cursing around here.

430
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:11,044
- That review went viral.
- What does that mean?

431
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:13,212
It means it got picked up
and re-tweeted everywhere.

432
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:15,298
So all these people
have read the review?

433
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,133
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

434
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:20,386
- I think it's kinda cool.
- I don't.

435
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:22,930
- No, I mean, us doing this.
- Doing what?

436
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:24,515
You know, just hanging out.

437
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:26,058
We hang out all the time.

438
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,800
No, like, hanging out
and doing something.

439
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:31,063
Well, we do things.

440
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:33,524
No, not just, like, watching
something or doing something.

441
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,901
Like, hanging out and talking.

442
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:37,695
And learning things
from each other.

443
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:39,780
I figured, you know, with
you living at Mom's house

444
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:43,117
and me working all the time, when we
hung out, you liked to do fun things.

445
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:46,245
I think this is kinda fun.
You know, just figuring stuff out.

446
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:48,488
Like when you lived at home.

447
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,617
Yeah, I miss that too.

448
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:55,328
Then why don't you move back home?

449
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:58,122
Percy, I can't just...

450
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:02,511
You're not the reason that I'm not
living at home. You know that, right?

451
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,179
- Mm-hm.
- 'Cause it's true.

452
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,306
- Then why?
- Then why what?

453
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:08,999
Well, why don't you live home?

454
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:13,313
Well, Mommy and Daddy, you know,

455
00:24:13,314 --> 00:24:17,400
we... we both grew apart,
in different directions.

456
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,611
But we're still
really good friends.

457
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:21,946
It's just better if we don't
live in the same house.

458
00:24:21,947 --> 00:24:23,823
- And that we're not married.
- Oh.

459
00:24:23,824 --> 00:24:25,950
- You understand?
- No.

460
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:28,229
It's hard to explain.

461
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,916
Hey, listen, could we twitter each other
when we're not in the same place?

462
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,876
- Yeah.
- Could you show me how to do that?

463
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:37,462
Yeah. OK.

464
00:24:37,463 --> 00:24:41,448
So, first you click here and you
have to enter your username.

465
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,885
- Right.
- You could also log in on your iPhone.

466
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:45,428
Uh-huh.

467
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:47,346
You click this button here,

468
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:49,932
it posts your feed so all
your followers can read it.

469
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,794
OK.

470
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:16,159
- Dad?
- Yeah.

471
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,538
You got 1,653 followers
since last night.

472
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,707
- Oh, is that good?
- It's amazing.

473
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,668
Oh, good. What does it mean?

474
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,881
It means that 1,653 people are
reading your Twitter feed.

475
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:32,550
Mm-hm. I thought it
was like texting.

476
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,678
Did you post anything
since last night?

477
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,638
- No.
- Are you sure?

478
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:40,224
Yeah, I just sent a private
message to somebody.

479
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,269
- To who?
- To that A-hole food critic.

480
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,647
You could only send private messages
to people who are following you.

481
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:48,774
I think you might have
posted that publicly.

482
00:27:48,775 --> 00:27:51,485
No, he wrote something nasty
about me and then I hit reply

483
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:53,404
and it let me send
a message to him.

484
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,448
Dad, replies are public.
Everybody can read them.

485
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:58,158
And it looks like he re-tweeted it

486
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:05,457
to all his 123,845 followers.

487
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,700
And he wrote back.

488
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:10,286
What did he say?

489
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:12,923
- I don't think I should read it.
- Just...

490
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,883
Can you read it to me, please?

491
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:17,208
Read the reply.

492
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:21,348
"@ChefCarlCasper...

493

00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,864
He wrote that to me?

He wrote it to everybody.

498
00:28:41,994 --> 00:28:43,828
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Wow.

499
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,496
You realise how many
people have read this?

00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:47,457
I'm up to 2,000 followers
since last night.

501
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,375
- You're trending, bro.
- They're sending me messages.

502
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:51,168
They're goading me into
responding to this prick.

503
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,504
- Don't do it. Don't do it, man.
- Don't do that, Chef.

504
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:55,172
- Don't respond. Take the high road.
- I know.

505
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:56,841
But half the people
are saying he's right.

506
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:58,759
Yeah, but half the people
are saying he's wrong.

507
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,636
- That's the fucking internet.
- That's right. Listen to him.

508
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:02,930
- That's social media. You on Twitter?
- Yeah, I'm Twitter.

509
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:04,682
- What's your name?
- Little Marty.

510
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:07,601
But all the people following me,
I don't wanna hang out during the day.

511
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:09,853
I avoid all... Oh, hey, hey,
hey, what are you doing?

512
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:11,397
- This guy.
- Don't. What are you writing?

513
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:12,940
Chef, don't... That's
not a good idea.

514
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:15,901
Just listen. I won't send it
until we all say it's OK.

515
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:17,694
"Why don't you come
by again tonight?

516
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,780
"I got a whole new menu
just for you, asshole."

517
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:22,115
- No, gimme the phone.
- That's not good. Not a good idea.

518
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:24,076
Don't do it!

519
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:25,994
- That's out there now, bro.
- It happened.

520
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:27,871
- Why'd you do that?
- You can't take that back.

521
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:29,998
You know what? I threw
down the gauntlet.

522
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,541
So get ready for a fight.

523
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:33,418
I'm gonna go drop Percy
off and come back

524
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,295
and cook the menu we
should've cooked last time.

525
00:29:35,296 --> 00:29:38,089
- So where are we going today?
- I gotta drop you off, kid.

526
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,217
I gotta go shopping for
tonight. I'm sorry.

527
00:29:40,218 --> 00:29:43,345
- Can I come with you?
- No, I'm sorry.

528
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:46,890
How come I'm, like, never
allowed to be in the kitchen?

529
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:49,809
Because it's hot and it's loud and
there's a lot of bad language.

530
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,686
So? I hear bad
language all the time.

531
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:53,938
- Where?
- Online.

532
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:56,691
What kind of website could a 10-year-old
get on that has bad language?

533
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:59,068
- YouTube.
- YouTube has bad language?

534
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,737
Could I at least come
shopping with you?

535
00:30:00,738 --> 00:30:02,280
No.

536
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:05,602
I got a lot to do and
a lot on my mind.

537
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:08,940
Look who's waiting for us.
Hi, Mommy.

538
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:14,125
Come here. I miss you.
Give me a kiss.

539
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,127
- Hi.
- Hi.

540
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:19,547
So my publicist said that
she can talk to you.

541
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:21,382
- Why don't you talk to her?
- About what?

542
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:24,468
- About Twitter?
- Everybody's reading what you wrote.

543
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:26,887
- I don't think you get it.
- Get what?

544
00:30:26,888 --> 00:30:29,664
Let's call her. Go inside
with me and we'll call her.

545
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:32,768
Yes, please, tell her
to call me immediately.

546
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:35,396
I have Carl with me.
I'm at home. Thank you.

547
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:37,815
- Alright, I'm gonna go.
- No, no, she's gonna call right back.

548
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:40,984
- She was on the other line.
- You're making more of this than it is.

549
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:42,903
I just don't like to
see you like this.

550
00:30:42,904 --> 00:30:44,988
Like what? I'm fine.
I have to get to work.

551
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:47,074
You're never going to be happy
cooking for someone else.

552
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:49,826
Is this about the food truck?
I don't wanna talk about it again.

553
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:52,954
Why not? You can cook your own
food. You can be your own boss.

554
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:55,290
I can book you for all the
parties that I'm doing.

555
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,375
I appreciate the offer, but
I don't need any charity

556
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:58,919
from you or your ex-husband.

557
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,296
- Why are you being so proud?
- Because I'm working.

558
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:02,839
And despite what you might think,

559
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,091
I have complete freedom to
cook whatever I want now.

560
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:06,635
I like my life.

561
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:09,763
And as far as your publicist goes,
when she calls back, you let her know

562
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:12,056
that I understand I shouldn't
tweet any pictures of my dick

563
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:13,933
and any career advice
should be kept to oneself.

564
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:15,435
OK? I'll see you later. Thank you.

565
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:18,187
- I got all this shit in the trunk.
- Want me to do this?

566
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:19,689
- Is it on?
- Yeah. We're doing it.

567
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,774
- We're doing it, guys.
- Come on. Let's get everything out.

568
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:25,820
I want the Cambros, the delis
out so we can start plating, OK?

569
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:27,905
Carl, can you tell me what's
going on for tonight?

570
00:31:27,906 --> 00:31:29,991
No, no, no, how many
covers do we have tonight?

571
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:32,827
How many? We are overbooked.
But I just printed out all the menus.

572
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:34,996
Good. It's not the menu you
got printed. It's different.

573
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:36,914
- That's what I understand.
- We're doing a tasting menu.

574
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:39,834
- Carl, I have to put the wine...
- A tasting menu for Ramsey Michel.

575
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,919
- I know, but we...
- He's coming. He knows about it.

576
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,546
- Did you see the 'Eater' article?
- I did.

577
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:45,506
- I'm so excited for you.
- It's all over the internet.

578
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:47,591
- I love it when you're like this.
- Taste the food.

579
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:49,677
Bring in the waitstaff,
have 'em taste the food.

580
00:31:49,678 --> 00:31:51,178
Make them understand
what we're going for.

581
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,554
- OK.
- OK?

582
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:54,640
We're not pushing specials today.
The whole menu is special.

583
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:57,226
- I'm excited.
- I'm excited. I'm finally happy.

584
00:31:57,227 --> 00:31:58,769
I'm happy, OK?

585
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,854
Am I allowed to be happy at work?

586
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:03,357
Carl. Carl. We're staying
with the same menu, right?

587
00:32:03,358 --> 00:32:05,025
I have something really
good planned for tonight.

588
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:06,568
I'm gonna let you...
It's not sweetbreads.

589
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:08,820
- You're gonna be able to taste it.
- That may be true.

590
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:11,531
But we have the most reservations
on a work night since we opened.

591
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:13,450
- You realise that?
- I know. I was on Twitter.

592
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,369
- Yeah.
- I was promoting the restaurant.

593
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,496
- I was on Twitter.
- What? Yeah, that's another thing.

594
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:21,333
From now on, before you post
anything online, I OK it. Alright?

595
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:22,876
The whole reason
everybody's here tonight

596
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:24,544
is because I called out
Ramsey Michel online

597
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:27,047
and they're all coming to
watch me stick it in his ass.

598
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:28,965
Yeah, and you're gonna
twitter an apology

599
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:32,510
for calling the most respected
critic in Los Angeles an asshole.

600
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:34,804
- I'm not gonna fucking apologise.
- What do you mean, you're not...

601
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:37,390
- You see what he wrote about me?
- I don't give a fuck...

602
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,309
- He started it!
- ..what he wrote. I don't care.

603
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,311
You're a cook. You're a chef.

604
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:44,105
This is what you've been cooking
for years, and it works.

605
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:47,525
And either you cook the menu that
our customers have come to ex...

606
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:49,861
- You want me to cook the same food?
- The same exact...

607
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:53,239
The same food that he ripped apart?
The same guy who's coming tonight?

608
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,907
The restaurant isn't
filled with critics!

609
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:56,993
It's filled with people
that've been eating your food

610
00:32:56,994 --> 00:32:59,370
for the last 10 years!

611
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:01,205
So now, suddenly, you're
gonna be an artist.

612
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:02,873
Well, be an artist
on your own time.

613
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:04,417
- Listen to me.
- No sweetbreads!

614
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:05,918
- Listen!
- No calves' brains.

615
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,461
I'm not cooking sweetbreads!
Listen to me.

616
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,672
The kitchen is my domain.
That was our deal.

617
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:11,590
I don't give a fuck
what the deal was!

618
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:14,260
The deal is now changed.
Either you stay or you go.

619
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:17,083
It's up to you. End of discussion.

620
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:25,521
- We got a full house of people... - Yeah.
- ..who are coming tonight... - Yeah.

621
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:27,940
- ..To eat my food.
- No, it's not your food, Carl.

622
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:30,025
It's not your food.

623
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:33,403
By definition, it's my food
because it's my restaurant.

624
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:35,822
I pay for the glasses.
I pay for the napkins.

625
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:38,575
I pay for the spoons.
I pay for Molly's salary.

626
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:41,161
I pay for your entire
staff's salary, OK?

627
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:43,538
So you either cook
my menu or Tony can.

628
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:45,624
Tony, you've been cooking
it half the time anyway.

629
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,902
Tell the truth. Right?

630
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:53,465
So you're threatening
to fire me now?

631
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:55,008
Am I threatening to fire you?

632
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:56,885
No, I'm telling you
what I'm prepared to do

633
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,636
if you don't cook my menu.

634
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,263
Subject closed.

635
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:03,099
Well, why don't you cook
the menu without a chef

636
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,226
and we see how it goes tonight?

637
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:08,881
Let's go, Tony. Fuck this.

638
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:13,302
Tony.

639
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:20,574
Good luck.

640
00:34:20,576 --> 00:34:22,118
- Oh, no way.
- Good luck, Jack.

641
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,661
- No way, man!
- Martin, Martin.

642
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,454
- No. Hell, no. Come on.
- You stay. Stay.

643
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:27,623
Martin, come on. Let me
go, buddy. Don't do it.

644
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:29,708
Don't do it. Just stay.

645
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:32,200
- Call me. Call me.
- You'd better believe it, yeah.

646
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:38,824
Tony, you got a full house
tonight. Be a pro, OK?

647
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:15,336
Let's go! Get the leg on.
Coming up.

648
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:17,755
Get that lava cake out, table 22.

649
00:35:17,757 --> 00:35:20,508
Bring that shit back.
Bring that shit back.

650
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:22,584
This is table 22.

651
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,799
Just a moment, please.

652
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:35,731
No, no, we gotta chiz this.
You didn't chiz it.

653
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,900
Welcome back.

654
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:40,027
Lovely to see you again,
Mr Michel. Right this way.

655
00:35:40,028 --> 00:35:41,570
Thank you.

656
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,907
- I hope traffic wasn't too bad.
- No, it wasn't.

657
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,804
- 30, I got one.
- Table 30's still missing the risotto.

658
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:09,960
What's going on with all
these tickets, man?

659
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:43,590
Yes? How can I help you?

660
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:45,300
Isn't this, um...

661
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:48,386
Wasn't this on the menu
last time I... I... I visited?

662
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:50,638
I believe it was.

663
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,589
I was under the impression that
tonight was gonna somehow be...

664
00:36:55,102 --> 00:36:57,937
be different, more of an event.

665
00:36:57,938 --> 00:36:59,564
I understand.

666
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:02,108
Is there something we can do
to make you more comfortable?

667
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:04,193
Um... could I actually...

668
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:06,529
Could I speak with the chef?
With Chef Casper?

669
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,408
I have a wonderful '09 that I
just opened to let breathe.

670
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:11,992
- Um...
- If I may?

671
00:37:11,993 --> 00:37:15,704
The last time I was in
Napa, at the vineyard,

672
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:17,873
they shipped me this
bottle as a gift,

673
00:37:17,874 --> 00:37:20,584
and I've just been waiting
for the right occasion.

674
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:22,878
That... that's very
generous of you.

675
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:24,755
Is Chef Casper here?

676
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:27,365
Unfortunately, he was called away.

677
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:29,676
Is he coming back?

678
00:37:29,677 --> 00:37:33,513
I'm afraid that was left ambiguous.

679
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:17,866
I need you out front. They're three
deep in the bar. Get off the phone.

680
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,160
- Please let me do my job.
- Please go to the bar.

681
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:22,495
- Tony!
- Carl, I can't talk right now.

682
00:39:22,496 --> 00:39:25,039
- We are in deep weeds.
- This guy's tweeting me.

683
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,625
This guy's calling me out online.
What the fuck are you serving?

684
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:30,586
I don't know. They're
serving the same shit.

685
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:32,171
- What's he eating?
- I think he's...

686
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:34,132
- What course is he on?
- He's...

687
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,300
He's eating the chocolate
lava cake right now.

688
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:38,636
You just keep him right
where the fuck he is.

689
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,680
- What?!
- I'm parking the car.

690
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:43,057
- Carl, what?
- Don't let him leave.

691
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:45,466
Keep the motherfucker there!

692
00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:50,272
Is he here? Is the
fucker still here?

693
00:39:50,273 --> 00:39:52,691
- Oh, fuck.
- Let's go into the back of the house.

694
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:55,945
I just wanna say one thing. I just
wanna say one thing. Just one thing.

695
00:39:55,946 --> 00:39:57,738
Let's go to the kitchen.

696
00:39:57,739 --> 00:39:59,657
Stop it. Stop it for a second!

697
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:01,533
Let's just...

698
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:04,119
I've been waiting to talk to
this prick for a long time.

699
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,663
- OK.
- I am not cloying. I am not needy.

700
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,207
I don't care what you think.

701
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:11,446
You're not getting to me.
I'm not needy!

702
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:15,547
Chocolate lava cake is not just
undercooked chocolate cake.

703
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:18,157
That's not what makes
the centre molten.

704
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:22,596
You take a frozen cylinder of ganache
and you set it in the ramekin

705
00:40:22,597 --> 00:40:25,557
so that as the outside cooks
fully, the inside becomes molten!

706
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:27,350
OK. OK.

707
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:31,634
It's fucking molten, see?
Its fucking molten, you asshole!

708
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:35,066
And you don't do anything.
What do you do?

709
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:39,895
You sit and you eat and you
vomit those words back.

710
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:42,115
To make people laugh.

711
00:40:42,116 --> 00:40:44,534
You know how hard I
work for this shit?

712
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:47,192
Do you know how hard
my whole staff works?

713
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:49,956
What sacrifices I make
to make you happy

714
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:54,752
and then you just smugly just
fucking shit on my shit?

715
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:57,588
OK.

716
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,340
- It hurts!
- Yes.

717
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:01,050
It fucking hurts when
you write that shit!

718
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:03,177
- It hurt you.
- It does. It does.

719
00:41:03,178 --> 00:41:07,473
He was... He thought you were gonna
close his fucking restaurant down!

720
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:09,798
You asshole!

721
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:16,273
And what do you? You just
write shit to make...

722
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:19,276
You just make shit up!
It was molten!

723
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:22,029
It's fucking molten!

724
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,572
Asshole!

725
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:26,492
- You're not getting to me.
- OK. OK.

726
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:28,619
- You're not getting to me!
- OK, Carl.

727
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,370
- He's not getting to me!
- No, he's not.

728
00:41:30,372 --> 00:41:32,414
I know, but you're a publicist.
Don't you have relationships?

729
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:35,250
Isn't that what you're hired to do?
To take these things off the internet?

730
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:36,793
But it's out there.

731
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,713
Even if I could persuade one
site to pull down one clip,

732
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:41,632
there are a dozen others
from other cell phones.

733
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,592
What should we... should
we at least lawyer up

734
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:45,385
and threaten legal
action or something?

735
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:47,596
You threatening them with
lawyers builds on a story

736
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:49,139
that's already getting
a lot of play.

737
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,891
And then you get another
week of headlines.

738
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:54,185
And then you got this food critic
posting fresh blogs about you nonstop.

739
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:56,605
And they're all getting picked
up, and the picked-up headlines

740
00:41:56,606 --> 00:41:58,231
are getting picked
up by each other.

741
00:41:58,232 --> 00:42:00,025
You know, it's
absolutely unbelievable.

742
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:01,526
- So...
- I've never seen anything like...

743
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:03,611
Wait a second... you're saying
there's nothing I could do?

744
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:05,905
To get the footage down?
No, that lives forever.

745
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:07,448
Great. Awesome.

746
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,993
But there just might be
an opportunity here.

747
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,203
How can this possibly
be an opportunity?

748
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:14,497
Well, I was holding
off until we spoke,

749
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,875
but I'm fairly certain we have
a good shot at 'Hell's Kitchen'.

750
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:20,253
- Wait, what?
- The reality show.

751
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:22,380
I don't think you understand
what's going on here.

752
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:24,173
I'm a real chef with...

753
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,259
- You said you needed money, right?
- A job.

754
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,844
A job, not money.
I need a job, like I had.

755
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:32,098
Well, your Twitter account says
you've got 20,000 followers.

756
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,266
- That's pretty damn big.
- Yeah, I'm gonna cancel the account.

757
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:35,810
- Don't worry.
- Don't cancel it!

758
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:37,895
I can get you money to
mention a few products.

759
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:40,439
Are you listening? I don't wanna
get involved with any of that.

760
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,483
- I wanna cook food.
- You got two choices.

761
00:42:42,484 --> 00:42:45,319
You can either lean into it
and work it for all it's worth...

762
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,112
Like Honey Boo Boo.
I don't want that.

763
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:49,156
You know how much she
pulls down? Or her mother?

764
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:51,158
I don't care what she makes.
Get to your point.

765
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:54,077
Or go underground and wait till the
storm passes. You got two choices.

766
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,954
I thought this shit
lives forever online.

767
00:42:55,955 --> 00:42:59,207
It does, but there's so much
news out there and it's so fast

768
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,293
and there's so much white noise,
nobody remembers anything.

769
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:04,463
OK, thank you for taking the time
and walking me through everything.

770
00:43:04,464 --> 00:43:06,006
It was very illuminating.

771
00:43:06,007 --> 00:43:07,799
Oh, you're hanging up? OK, listen.

772
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,801
I want you to call any time.
I'm right here.

773
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:12,888
If you can't get me, I'm on a
cell phone and I've got a pager.

774
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:15,223
- OK. Thank you, and thank Inez for me.
- No, thank you.

775
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:16,891
- And what about 'Hell's Kitchen'?
- What about it?

776
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:19,811
- You still want me to pursue it, right?
- No, I don't want you to.

777
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:22,522
- OK, I won't call 'em, but I'll email.
- Are you not listening to...

778
00:43:22,523 --> 00:43:24,941
I'm gonna go, OK?
I got a call coming in.

779
00:43:24,942 --> 00:43:27,883
OK. Alright. I'll tell you
how 'Hell's Kitchen' goes.

780
00:43:28,404 --> 00:43:29,946
Fucking idiot.

781
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:32,105
Oh, man.

782
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:35,243
- Hey, Inez.
- Hi.

783
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:38,371
- Did you talk to Jen?
- Yeah, I just got off with her.

784
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:41,666
- And?
- And, uh, you know, it's terrible.

785
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:44,669
What do you want me to
tell you? I just wanna cook.

786
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,796
Everything is going to work out.

787
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:49,548
Half-a-dozen places tried to poach
me when I was back at Gauloises.

788
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,634
I'm trying to line up some
interviews for next week.

789
00:43:51,635 --> 00:43:53,844
That's good.

790
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:57,014
Yeah, so, listen, until this
whole job thing works out,

791
00:43:57,015 --> 00:43:59,921
could you keep Percy for me?

792
00:44:01,812 --> 00:44:05,547
But you're still taking him
with you to New Orleans, right?

793
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:08,474
Is he there?

794
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:11,153
I'll tell him.

795
00:44:11,154 --> 00:44:13,363
Ah, let me... let me talk to him.

796
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:15,439
Put him on.

797
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:24,082
Hey, Dad. I understand if
we can't go to New Orleans.

798
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,626
Oh, man, thank you so
much for saying that.

799
00:44:26,627 --> 00:44:30,297
Just Daddy's so busy with work
right now. You're the best.

800
00:44:30,298 --> 00:44:32,340
Maybe some other time.

801
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:36,077
Yes, we will, for sure. Thank you.

802
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:40,170
'Bye.

803
00:44:53,028 --> 00:44:54,988
Oh, jefecito.

804
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:58,032
What's up, man? Look,
everybody. Jefe's here.

805
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:00,159
Come on, give me some drinks.
Something premium.

806
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,603
Ketel One for the man.

807
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:05,122
Oh, dude. Oh, you're everywhere.

808
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:06,666
- You saw it?
- Ohh!

809
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:09,710
- It's bad. How bad is it?
- You saw it? You saw it?

810
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:11,254
- I saw it. It's everywhere.
- It's terrible.

811
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:13,130
- Is it bad?
- You're never gonna work again.

812
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:15,007
I am, though.

813
00:45:15,008 --> 00:45:17,760
No, seriously, there are people...
there are people who are calling me.

814
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:21,305
- Dude. Oh, great. I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes. Yes.

815
00:45:21,306 --> 00:45:23,390
I knew you would have
something bigger than this.

816
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:25,267
- You don't care about coming back here.
- Yeah.

817
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:27,978
So you came back to tell
me you got me a gig?

818
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:29,521
'Cause I'll leave Gauloises
like that, baby.

819
00:45:29,522 --> 00:45:32,274
No. Trust me, the first phone call
as soon as something becomes real.

820
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:33,942
- Don't leave me behind again.
- I will not.

821
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:35,611
- Don't ever do that again.
- Don't hit me.

822
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:37,279
- This guy.
- Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.

823
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,281
I'm really sorry.
I was on the spot, bro.

824
00:45:39,282 --> 00:45:42,200
I had been drinking that day. I...
I... I didn't know what to do.

825
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:44,286
- I'm a pussy, basically. I'm sorry.
- It's OK. It's over.

826
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:46,621
- I vouch for that.
- It's fine. What are you gonna do?

827
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,957
- It's a big opport...
- But then they put you on YouTube.

828
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,751
And I felt so responsible
for that shit.

829
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:53,211
- That shit was funny, by the way.
- What was funny about it?

830
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:56,047
- It's not funny for me.
- Just that everybody I know saw it.

831
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:59,050
- I know, I know.
- I kinda felt famous by knowing you.

832
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:04,639
Is it a little bit funny? Like... Like, is it...
they're laughing at me or with me?

833
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,766
A little bit of both.

834
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,561
They're laughing with you and
at you at the same time.

835
00:46:09,562 --> 00:46:12,230
- It's so embarrassing.
- Oh, it is terrible. It is so bad.

836
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:13,898
But it's funny too
at the same time.

837
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,984
It makes you kind of
likeable in a weird way.

838
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:19,278
Yeah. That guy deserved it. Everybody
knows that guy deserved it.

839
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,280
- But, seriously, I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

840
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,949
You know, I'm gonna
land on my feet.

841
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,450
- Oh, you will.
- Yeah, good. I know.

842
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,494
- I'll get my next gig.
- I'll be there with you.

843
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:28,538
- Everything will be fine.
- I'm your sous-chef now and forever.

844
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:31,040
You're not my sous-chef anymore.
You are chef de cuisine.

845
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,042
- But I wouldn't even be there...
- It doesn't matter.

846
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,835
Riva's right about one thing.

847
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:37,588
You are ready to run your
own kitchen. So don't blow it.

848
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:39,131
It's a big opportunity for you.

849
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:41,675
- To Tony's big new opportunity.
- To Tony's big opportunity.

850
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:44,136
- To chef de cuisine.
- I don't like how it happened.

851
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:47,848
- But I'm happy it happened. OK?
- Two words, man.

852
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:50,589
You guys. I love you fucking guys.

853
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:54,855
- I love you, Tony. I love you.
- Thanks, Chef.

854
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:56,482
- Look at that.
- Mmm.

855
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,400
I love both of you.

856
00:46:58,401 --> 00:46:59,943
We love you, man.

857
00:46:59,944 --> 00:47:02,696
Let's have a three-way right here.
Come on. Come on.

858
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,364
- Hang on, hang on.
- I love you, man.

859
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:07,075
- I'm glad you made up with him.
- Thanks. Did you take the garbage out?

860
00:47:07,076 --> 00:47:10,537
The truth of the matter
is nobody's calling me.

861
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:12,581
I got no job prospects whatsoever.

862
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:15,083
- What about those offers you got?
- No. It's all dried out.

863
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:17,586
- Why, from the online shit?
- It must be from the online thing.

864
00:47:17,587 --> 00:47:20,589
- Come on.
- I'm like a fucking cat playing a piano.

865
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,173
I don't even know what that means.

866
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:23,925
I'm everywhere.

867
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:26,365
OK? Like, I'm, like...
I'm, like, a meme.

868
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:29,514
Know what a meme is?
I'm a meme. I'm a fucking meme.

869
00:47:29,515 --> 00:47:31,641
Carl, you need to take a break.

870
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:34,102
I've been on a break.
I've had too much of a break.

871
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:36,187
- No, you need a real break.
- I need to work.

872
00:47:36,188 --> 00:47:38,523
- I need to get back into a kitchen.
- You don't. Carl...

873
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:41,401
I wish I never... I should've cooked
the shit he wanted me to cook.

874
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:44,278
You gonna go work for another
Riva in some other restaurant?

875
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:48,157
You've been miserable here as
long as I've known you, Carl.

876
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:50,701
- That's not true. We've had a blast.
- Yes, we've had a blast.

877
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:53,145
And now it's time for you to go.

878
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,748
You don't belong here anymore.
You know it. Come on.

879
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:57,625
What's th... Who's this girl?

880
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:59,950
- Carl.
- What?

881
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:03,422
- Be real with me.
- I am.

882
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,508
You've been ignoring a lot
of things in your life

883
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:07,916
that need your
attention, like Percy.

884
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:15,642
I'm not dad material right
now, if you hadn't noticed.

885
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,936
I'm embarrassing.

886
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,272
He sees all this shit
on the computer.

887
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,691
- Well...
- His friends have...

888
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,611
Maybe it's important for you
to talk to him about it, then.

889
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:28,697
- I just...
- He needs you, Carl.

890
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,992
I'm... I don't know him, OK?
He's at a weird age.

891
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,934
Why don't you take this
time to get to know him?

892
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,077
I want you to be happy.

893
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,498
You're not happy.

894
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,293
You're never gonna be happy here.

895
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,047
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

896
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,059
I've never not known what I was
gonna do. I've always known.

897
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,727
There's always been
the next thing to do.

898
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,564
And now that it's all ended, and I'm,
like... I'm, like, fucking lost.

899
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,423
I think that's a
good place to start.

900
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,442
Come here.

901
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,946
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

902
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:26,337
- I'll hold down the fort. I promise.
- OK. You do that.

903
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,449
Thank you.

904
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,305
Hi, Flora. Percy here?

905
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,223
Percy aqui?

906
00:49:38,224 --> 00:49:40,184
- He's inside.
- Can you tell him I'm here?

907
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,727
- Sure.
- Thanks.

908
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,521
- Hi.
- Why are you here?

909
00:49:44,522 --> 00:49:46,857
I'm here to see...
here to see Percy.

910
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,400
- Oh.
- It's been a while.

911
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:51,570
I'm glad you're here, but why didn't
you call to say that you were coming?

912
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,239
- I don't know, because...
- He said he's sleeping.

913
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,741
- OK. I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, wait one second.

914
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,077
She said he says he's sleeping,
but if he was sleeping,

915
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:00,996
she'd just say he's sleeping,
so he's not sleeping.

916
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:04,499
- Let me talk to him.
- Can you talk to me for one second first?

917
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,192
Please? Come.

918
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:12,117
Percy and I are going to
Miami to see my father.

919
00:50:12,925 --> 00:50:14,801
So why don't you come with us?

920
00:50:14,802 --> 00:50:17,345
- What?
- Yeah, come with us.

921
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:20,265
You want me to go... I can't
come with you to Miami.

922
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:22,141
I don't... I got all...

923
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:23,893
I don't have any money.

924
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:26,813
I need to wait for another job,
for all this shit to blow over

925
00:50:26,814 --> 00:50:28,356
with the internet,
Twitter, all that shit.

926
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:30,608
Yeah, but I could lend you
some money before you...

927
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:32,944
I don't want your money.
I can't take charity from you.

928
00:50:32,945 --> 00:50:34,487
You know that he's really upset

929
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:37,643
because he couldn't go with
you to New Orleans, right?

930
00:50:38,742 --> 00:50:41,849
He's hurt. He misses you.

931
00:50:44,498 --> 00:50:47,041
OK. What do you want me to do?

932
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:49,585
You know that the nannies
can't get on the plane.

933
00:50:49,586 --> 00:50:52,546
So why don't you come with us

934
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:55,619
and you take care of
him while I work?

935
00:50:56,134 --> 00:50:58,469
So you need me to come
with you to watch Percy?

936
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,637
- Yeah.
- So I'm the nanny?

937
00:51:00,638 --> 00:51:03,924
Yes, his nanny, in Miami.

938
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:08,186
It might be good. That's where
it all happened for you.

939
00:51:08,188 --> 00:51:09,730
That's where Percy was born,

940
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:12,274
that's where you got your
first job as a chef.

941
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:15,110
Maybe it will just, like,
clear your mind out.

942
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:17,487
You think Percy would
be OK with that?

943
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:19,322
Percy would love it.

944
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,194
Hm?

945
00:51:26,163 --> 00:51:28,322
What do you say?

946
00:52:01,406 --> 00:52:03,657
I have to run out for
a quick meeting,

947
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:05,993
so make sure when you go upstairs
that everything is pressed,

948
00:52:05,994 --> 00:52:08,496
order him some food, make sure
he takes a nap, a bath...

949
00:52:08,497 --> 00:52:10,581
- Wait, wait, wait, a nap?
- Get him ready for tonight.

950
00:52:10,582 --> 00:52:12,583
- I'm 10.
- It's gonna be a long night.

951
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:14,418
We're gonna see Abuelito play.

952
00:52:14,419 --> 00:52:16,629
- Where? At Hoy Como Ayer?
- Mm-hm.

953
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,964
- Isn't he a little young for that?
- Too young for what?

954
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:20,507
He's not gonna perform forever.

955
00:52:20,508 --> 00:52:23,635
He wants his grandson to see
him play at least once.

956
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:25,554
Alright, well, better
keep an eye on him.

957
00:52:25,555 --> 00:52:27,639
- That place could get pretty crazy.
- Me keep an eye?

958
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,834
That's why you're going too.

959
00:52:37,442 --> 00:52:39,693
- Where are we?
- This is Little Havana.

960
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:42,487
- Like in 'Grand Theft Auto'?
- No, this is where I grew up.

961
00:52:42,488 --> 00:52:44,030
- You did?
- Yes.

962
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:47,450
And this is where
Abuelito lives and works.

963
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:49,953
Grandpa still works?
What does he do?

964
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,094
I can't see.

965
00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:16,621
- Eh, no, Papa.
- What did he say?

966
00:54:16,622 --> 00:54:18,957
No, he's asking if
we're back together.

967
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:22,252
No, no, we're friends. I'm
helping watch the baby.

968
00:54:26,006 --> 00:54:27,548
Wait, what's he...
I don't understand.

969
00:54:27,549 --> 00:54:30,218
He said that you look like
you've gained a couple of pounds

970
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:31,928
since he saw you last.

971
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:33,471
Maybe since last
time, I understand,

972
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:36,432
but, actually, recently,
I'm down 15 pounds.

973
00:54:42,022 --> 00:54:43,689
- 20?
- He's saying that he lost 20 pounds.

974
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,775
- 20.
- I know what he said. But I'm down...

975
00:54:45,776 --> 00:54:49,195
That is in two months. I'm down...
In two weeks, I've lost 15.

976
00:54:49,717 --> 00:54:51,888
My suit doesn't even
fit me anymore.

977
00:54:52,824 --> 00:54:54,700
He's saying his pants might fall.

978
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:56,243
20 pounds. 20.

979
00:54:56,244 --> 00:54:58,996
Why does he have to say 20?
I say 15, he says 20.

980
00:54:58,997 --> 00:55:00,789
I could... Alright.

981
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,667
These are really good. We should
wake up Percy so he can try one.

982
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:07,421
He say, "Just let him sleep. It's too late."

983
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:11,174
No, but he's never had a real Cuban
sandwich. I want him to try it.

984
00:55:12,218 --> 00:55:14,344
He says you should make him one.

985
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:17,431
I want him to have a real one
from here, from Little Havana.

986
00:55:17,432 --> 00:55:21,059
Abuelo... Everything OK?

987
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:25,689
This is really good, by the way.

988
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,884
Yours are way better.

989
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:35,930
You think people would like
this kind of food back home?

990
00:55:36,575 --> 00:55:39,861
- You think people would like it?
- Yeah, it's real food. Why not?

991
00:55:41,997 --> 00:55:44,582
- Maybe I'll talk to Marvin.
- Mm-hm.

992
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:47,418
Let me hear him out. You know?

993
00:55:47,419 --> 00:55:50,028
See what he's got in
mind for the food truck.

994
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,632
Think he's in town?

995
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:56,536
I don't know, but, you know, I can
find out tomorrow... I call him.

996
00:55:57,304 --> 00:56:00,056
You know he's here. Is this the
whole reason you brought me out?

997
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:02,299
I don't know what
you're talking about.

998
00:56:02,976 --> 00:56:05,061
Try this. The yucca's amazing.

999
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:07,137
I love yucca.

1000
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,806
You're full of shit.

1001
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:28,375
Hi. I'm Carl Casper.
I'm here to see Marvin.

1002
00:56:28,376 --> 00:56:32,243
- Booties?
- Excuse me?

1003
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,675
In case you don't want
to remove your shoes.

1004
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:38,953
Thank you.

1005
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:49,938
- Uh!
- Follow me, please.

1006
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:56,888
Uhh!

1007
00:57:04,495 --> 00:57:06,412
- Casper's here.
- How ya doing?

1008
00:57:06,413 --> 00:57:08,581
- Glad you're here. Look at you.
- How's it going?

1009
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:10,124
Come over here.
Candy, come over here.

1010
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,834
You're a sight for sore eyes.

1011
00:57:11,835 --> 00:57:14,420
What you want to eat, something?
I want to see you eat something.

1012
00:57:14,421 --> 00:57:18,007
Alright? I'm worried. Eat
some crackers or something.

1013
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:20,083
Thanks.

1014
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:23,804
Look at you.

1015
00:57:23,805 --> 00:57:26,766
She's pregnant. Just found out.

1016
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,893
The... This one?

1017
00:57:28,894 --> 00:57:32,713
Pissed on a stick, came in,
laid it on me five seconds ago.

1018
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,482
Is it... So it's yours?

1019
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:38,473
I don't know. That's
what she's saying.

1020
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:41,697
- You don't...
- I know.

1021
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:44,616
I got a problem, 'cause she's...
best receptionist I've ever had.

1022
00:57:44,617 --> 00:57:47,578
- Yeah.
- Good news is I had my tubes tied in '08.

1023
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,289
So, clearly, she's
also a fucking liar.

1024
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,916
- Right. That's tough.
- What do you want?

1025
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:54,459
You want a coconut water?

1026
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,253
- Um...
- You OK?

1027
00:57:56,254 --> 00:57:57,879
I'm alright. I'm alright.

1028
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,548
- Do you want a drink?
- I would... No.

1029
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:01,675
Let's make some decisions
together. Let's start right here.

1030
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:03,218
- Alright, so...
- Let's start off easy.

1031
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:06,471
We got shit to talk about. Look,
bang, you got four swatches, right?

1032
00:58:06,472 --> 00:58:09,349
Let's start off easy and then we'll
get into the uncomfortable stuff.

1033
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,309
- Pick it.
- The... For the...

1034
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:13,144
For here? I don't know.

1035
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:14,688
Yeah, I'm putting a carpet down,

1036
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:17,941
'cause people keep slippin' around
like it's a fuckin' ice rink in here.

1037
00:58:17,942 --> 00:58:21,611
You could always get 'em...
take the booties off and, uh...

1038
00:58:21,612 --> 00:58:23,404
Can't do that.

1039
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:25,073
We'll go with,
I don't know, this one?

1040
00:58:25,074 --> 00:58:26,741
- You like that one?
- I think...

1041
00:58:26,742 --> 00:58:29,243
If I had to... But if you're
not gonna paint, I would...

1042
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:30,912
This just seems like
it goes with anything.

1043
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:32,664
People aren't walking
on the walls, Carl.

1044
00:58:32,665 --> 00:58:34,332
Or I could keep it if I want.

1045
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:36,417
- The...
- Keep the kid.

1046
00:58:36,418 --> 00:58:37,960
- Yeah.
- Knowing that it's not mine.

1047
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:41,247
- Yes.
- You know, for once, I'm a good guy.

1048
00:58:41,757 --> 00:58:44,926
She stays on my desk and I
fucking got something on her.

1049
00:58:44,927 --> 00:58:47,085
But you decide. What do you think?

1050
00:58:47,721 --> 00:58:49,638
Are we... we're talking
about the carpet now

1051
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,307
or are we talking about
the, um... the...

1052
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:53,684
- We're talking about...
- I don't even know anymore.

1053
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:56,562
I think, um...

1054
00:58:56,563 --> 00:58:58,397
I'd go with the brown.

1055
00:58:58,398 --> 00:59:01,317
And as far as that goes,
that's a personal... that's...

1056
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:04,361
- I don't know.
- You're not a turd, OK?

1057
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:08,657
I don't want you to feel that way coming
in here with your hat in your hand.

1058
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:11,201
You went fucking crazy on the
internet. That was awesome.

1059
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:14,955
You lost respect, which I
love, 'cause it's passion.

1060
00:59:14,956 --> 00:59:16,498
You know, you lost everything.

1061
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:19,835
You know, you're not a loser,
but you have lost, OK?

1062
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:22,629
You're not a turd.
A turd that lost.

1063
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,673
I don't know that I
feel like a turd.

1064
00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:26,883
- Good.
- I feel like I had a bad week.

1065
00:59:26,884 --> 00:59:30,262
I feel like I lost my job, I made
an ass of myself on the internet.

1066
00:59:30,263 --> 00:59:32,514
I'm divorced, I'm
old, I got no money.

1067
00:59:32,515 --> 00:59:34,182
I live in a shitty
apartment in Venice.

1068
00:59:34,183 --> 00:59:36,267
But you know what makes
me feel like a turd?

1069
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:39,104
That I'm in my ex-wife's ex-husband's
office and asking for a fucking favour

1070
00:59:39,105 --> 00:59:40,772
and all he's doing
is busting my balls.

1071
00:59:40,773 --> 00:59:43,631
I like this humility. It's good.

1072
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:52,408
Truth be told, food trucks are a
great idea. You know what I mean?

1073
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:54,952
I think we take it back
to something simple.

1074
00:59:54,953 --> 00:59:57,872
Let me see if I got something to
say anymore. I don't even know.

1075
00:59:57,873 --> 00:59:59,415
- It's no problem.
- I'll pay you back.

1076
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:03,127
As long as it's not weird for you...
I don't want you to feel like

1077
01:00:03,128 --> 01:00:05,880
because you were with Inez and
you guys were sleeping together

1078
01:00:05,881 --> 01:00:08,257
and I was with her
and we had this...

1079
01:00:08,258 --> 01:00:11,719
I was with her, then you were with her,
and then maybe I fucked her after.

1080
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,914
I don't even know what
happened with us.

1081
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:17,057
I came out to LA for
a Clippers game once

1082
01:00:17,058 --> 01:00:19,977
and I think we had a couple of
drinks and we went to Islands.

1083
01:00:19,978 --> 01:00:22,062
- And I think she had...
- What happened between you two?

1084
01:00:22,063 --> 01:00:24,064
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Here's what happened.

1085
01:00:24,065 --> 01:00:27,776
We're talking about a white-on-white
'88 Chevy Grumman food truck.

1086
01:00:27,777 --> 01:00:30,112
It's a blank canvas
for your dreams.

1087
01:00:30,113 --> 01:00:32,271
I'm gonna have 'em pull it around.

1088
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:34,783
Thank you.

1089
01:00:34,784 --> 01:00:37,227
Don't thank me till you see it.

1090
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:02,560
Yeah. I'm in Miami now.

1091
01:01:02,561 --> 01:01:04,562
What happened to those
interviews you had?

1092
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:06,272
None of the prospects panned out.

1093
01:01:06,273 --> 01:01:08,515
- For real?
- Yeah.

1094
01:01:09,026 --> 01:01:10,568
It sucks.

1095
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:12,737
I guess you'll have to stay
there for a while, bro.

1096
01:01:12,738 --> 01:01:17,352
Hey, Carl. Hey, papi, mira, I don't
know if you heard or not, but...

1097
01:01:17,868 --> 01:01:20,077
I got bumped up, man, to sous-chef.

1098
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,621
- Sous-chef?
- Yeah.

1099
01:01:21,622 --> 01:01:23,247
No shit! That's excellent!

1100
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:25,458
Congratulations, man.
That's a big deal.

1101
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:28,002
Thank you, man. That means a
lot coming from you, seriously.

1102
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:30,588
Yeah, but enough about me.
So, what are you gonna do?

1103
01:01:30,589 --> 01:01:32,783
You're gonna laugh.

1104
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:35,885
- I got a food truck.
- Get the hell out!

1105
01:01:35,886 --> 01:01:38,387
No shit. You got a
fucking taco truck?

1106
01:01:38,388 --> 01:01:41,557
Tony! Tony, Carl's got
a fucking taco truck.

1107
01:01:41,558 --> 01:01:43,517
For real?

1108
01:01:43,518 --> 01:01:45,978
- Jefe! Like with tacos and shit?
- I just...

1109
01:01:45,979 --> 01:01:48,605
Yeah, I would assume.
What are you gonna cook?

1110
01:01:48,606 --> 01:01:52,693
You know, Cuban sandwiches,
plátanos, arroz con pollo.

1111
01:01:52,694 --> 01:01:54,778
Simple shit like we used
to do for family meal.

1112
01:01:54,779 --> 01:01:56,280
Oh, yeah, I remember
those days, man.

1113
01:01:56,281 --> 01:01:58,574
- Fuck he doing with a taco truck?
- Goddamn.

1114
01:01:58,575 --> 01:02:01,660
- I'd love some of that shit now.
- What's he doing with a taco truck?

1115
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:03,620
- It's good, right? It could be cool.
- Yeah.

1116
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:05,539
Get the fuck off the
phone, bro. Let's go!

1117
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,207
Alright, alright, alright!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

1118
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:09,251
Attila the Hun is calling me.
I gotta go, man.

1119
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:11,244
Alright. Be good, man.

1120
01:02:12,213 --> 01:02:15,048
- Is this the new truck?
- This is it. This is the truck.

1121
01:02:15,049 --> 01:02:16,591
- Ahh!
- It's got good bones.

1122
01:02:16,592 --> 01:02:18,259
It's gonna need a lot
of work, though.

1123
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:20,011
What doesn't?

1124
01:02:20,012 --> 01:02:22,013
Wanna take a look around, champ?

1125
01:02:22,014 --> 01:02:23,556
- Do I have to?
- Go!

1126
01:02:23,557 --> 01:02:26,559
Go and look at your
dad's new truck.

1127
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,270
Can I ask you a question?

1128
01:02:29,271 --> 01:02:31,064
Is something wrong?

1129
01:02:31,065 --> 01:02:33,441
- Did you sleep with him?
- With who?

1130
01:02:33,442 --> 01:02:35,276
With Marvin. Did you
sleep with Marvin?

1131
01:02:35,277 --> 01:02:37,153
But of course I did.
He's my ex-husband.

1132
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:39,155
I mean, since we were
divorced. Have you slept...

1133
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:41,282
Who did you sleep
with last, him or me?

1134
01:02:41,283 --> 01:02:43,784
I'm sorry, but this is none of
your business what I did...

1135
01:02:43,786 --> 01:02:45,703
- I think it might be.
- ..after I divorce you.

1136
01:02:45,704 --> 01:02:49,415
Second of all, I don't ask you what
you do with your hot little waitress.

1137
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:50,916
- That's completely different.
- OK, really.

1138
01:02:50,918 --> 01:02:52,418
- And that's not fair.
- Yeah, yeah.

1139
01:02:52,419 --> 01:02:54,545
This is somebody you loved
and shared a life with...

1140
01:02:54,546 --> 01:02:56,630
Why do we have to talk
about this right now?

1141
01:02:56,631 --> 01:02:58,549
Because I took a business
meeting with the guy.

1142
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,885
- This is not the moment.
- It is. I wanna know why.

1143
01:03:00,886 --> 01:03:02,678
He's smiling like he's
got something on me.

1144
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,555
- I dunno what it is.
- Please, you know him.

1145
01:03:04,556 --> 01:03:07,266
- I do know how him.
- You know how he is. So who cares?

1146
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:08,809
- I care!
- Why do you need to know?

1147
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:10,978
- I just would like to...
- OK.

1148
01:03:10,979 --> 01:03:12,688
It doesn't bother me.
I just wanna know.

1149
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:16,608
Just listen. I was very sad.
I was very lonely.

1150
01:03:16,609 --> 01:03:18,944
- And you, more than anyone, know...
- OK. That's it. That's enough.

1151
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:21,071
how I get after I have
a couple of drinks.

1152
01:03:21,072 --> 01:03:22,990
- I don't want to know the details.
- I get...

1153
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:24,491
Please. I'm not one
of your girlfriends.

1154
01:03:24,492 --> 01:03:26,368
- Don't tell me. Stop talking.
- He was my first.

1155
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:30,080
- OK, the kid's here.
- It came out like a natural, organic thing.

1156
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:32,607
- I don't want to know about this.
- We didn't...

1157
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,783
We didn't go through with it.

1158
01:03:37,588 --> 01:03:40,957
Sat there and we realised
we're just good friends.

1159
01:03:42,802 --> 01:03:44,427
I think there's something
dead in there.

1160
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:47,097
Uhh. OK, go and look for it.
Maybe it's a rat.

1161
01:03:47,098 --> 01:03:50,016
- Let's go look for the rat.
- I have to work, and I'll be back.

1162
01:03:50,017 --> 01:03:51,935
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- You're going? No, no, no.

1163
01:03:51,936 --> 01:03:53,436
You can't leave.

1164
01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:55,355
You said you were
going to help me, OK?

1165
01:03:55,356 --> 01:03:57,899
Go work with your dad. It's fun.

1166
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,055
I'll be back later. 'Bye.

1167
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:09,410
Alright. Take that bucket, fill it.

1168
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:11,605
- See the hose?
- Mm-hm.

1169
01:04:25,218 --> 01:04:26,760
Trash, trash, trash.

1170
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:28,387
Save that, save that.

1171
01:04:28,388 --> 01:04:30,665
Save the metal ones.

1172
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,434
Ugh!

1173
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:39,843
Tip it over.

1174
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:43,309
Alright, buddy.

1175
01:04:44,237 --> 01:04:46,154
I got some presents for you.

1176
01:04:46,155 --> 01:04:48,230
Watch this.

1177
01:04:49,158 --> 01:04:51,201
Steel wool, right?

1178
01:04:51,202 --> 01:04:53,954
- Mm-hm.
- Scrub brush. Right?

1179
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:57,157
I want you to do that
on the whole truck.

1180
01:05:11,222 --> 01:05:13,723
Hey, buddy, you don't have to
clean that. We're throwing it out.

1181
01:05:13,724 --> 01:05:15,799
Alright? Clean something else.

1182
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,577
Alright, that looks good.
Clean out the lowboy now.

1183
01:05:34,578 --> 01:05:36,120
- The what?
- The low...

1184
01:05:36,121 --> 01:05:39,442
The reach-in fridge,
right here. Clean this out.

1185
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:45,254
Ohh! That's it.

1186
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:47,715
That's where the smell's
coming from. What is that?

1187
01:05:47,716 --> 01:05:50,325
I don't know. Whatever
it is, clean it out.

1188
01:05:58,643 --> 01:06:00,519
- Ohh...
- What the hell are you doing?

1189
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,397
- You told me to clean it out.
- Not throw it in the garbage.

1190
01:06:03,398 --> 01:06:05,899
That's a perfectly good
hotel pan. Scrub it out.

1191
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,444
No, that's gross! I'm
not cleaning that out.

1192
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:11,696
- Pick it out of the garbage.
- Are you kidding?

1193
01:06:11,698 --> 01:06:13,782
- It's disgusting.
- You don't throw it in the garbage.

1194
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:16,535
Like we saved the rest of
the stuff. Let's just clean it out.

1195
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:18,411
No.

1196
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:20,737
- Pick it out of the trash.
- No.

1197
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:25,111
Pick it out of the trash can.

1198
01:06:27,004 --> 01:06:28,713
You wanted to work in a kitchen.

1199
01:06:28,714 --> 01:06:30,924
This is what working
in a kitchen is, OK?

1200
01:06:30,925 --> 01:06:33,426
- We don't throw shit out.
- Yeah, I wanted to come and cook.

1201
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:35,386
- Not clean it!
- Pick it out of the garbage!

1202
01:06:35,387 --> 01:06:37,180
No! I cleaned your
whole stupid truck!

1203
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:39,375
Why are you so mean to me?!

1204
01:06:57,993 --> 01:07:01,195
Hey, I can't get a
hold of your mom.

1205
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,622
But you... The truck looks great.

1206
01:07:03,623 --> 01:07:05,708
You did a great job.
I'm sorry I was mean.

1207
01:07:05,709 --> 01:07:08,033
That wasn't right of me.

1208
01:07:09,337 --> 01:07:11,255
I gotta pick up some
equipment for the truck.

1209
01:07:11,256 --> 01:07:15,092
You wanna come with me and help me
pick out a stove till Mom calls back?

1210
01:07:15,093 --> 01:07:16,677
Fine.

1211
01:07:16,678 --> 01:07:18,887
Alright. Let's go.

1212
01:07:27,272 --> 01:07:28,897
You know what this is?

1213
01:07:28,898 --> 01:07:31,024
- French fries?
- That's right, a fryer.

1214
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:33,527
This is the one we need right
here. Come on, let's go.

1215
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,112
Double convection oven underneath.
It's a real workhorse.

1216
01:07:36,114 --> 01:07:39,282
60 inches. I think we could fit them
on the truck. What do you think?

1217
01:07:39,283 --> 01:07:41,660
- Let's get it.
- Let's get this one. Good. Done.

1218
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:43,453
This is the... Ah,
here's what we need.

1219
01:07:43,454 --> 01:07:45,538
This is the thing I was
looking for. Right there.

1220
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,665
- A George Foreman grill?
- That's not a George Foreman grill.

1221
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:49,751
It's called a plancha. We make
Cuban sandwiches on that.

1222
01:07:49,752 --> 01:07:53,171
This is the key to our entire
livelihood. We need two of these.

1223
01:07:53,172 --> 01:07:54,714
Looks good. You know what?

1224
01:07:54,715 --> 01:07:57,967
Let's also get the 6-inch chef's
knife with the plastic handle.

1225
01:07:57,968 --> 01:08:01,455
- Then you need also the holder.
- Yeah, let's get a cover as well.

1226
01:08:01,972 --> 01:08:04,131
OK, you see this, Percy?

1227
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:06,392
That's a chef's knife.

1228
01:08:06,393 --> 01:08:07,977
A real chef's knife.

1229
01:08:07,978 --> 01:08:10,670
It's not a toy. You understand?

1230
01:08:11,315 --> 01:08:14,233
This thing's sharp. It can send you
to the hospital if you're not careful.

1231
01:08:14,234 --> 01:08:16,476
I'll teach you how
to use this thing.

1232
01:08:18,363 --> 01:08:21,115
But a chef's knife, it belongs
to the chef, not to the kitchen.

1233
01:08:21,116 --> 01:08:24,952
So it's your responsibility to keep
it sharp, clean, not to lose it.

1234
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:27,693
- Can you handle that?
- Yes.

1235
01:08:28,206 --> 01:08:30,124
This is a good knife.

1236
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:32,626
It'll last you a long time
if you take care of it.

1237
01:08:32,627 --> 01:08:34,712
Don't lose it.

1238
01:08:34,713 --> 01:08:37,702
I won't. Thank you.

1239
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,875
You earned it.

1240
01:08:43,096 --> 01:08:45,180
How are we gonna
get it in the truck?

1241
01:08:45,181 --> 01:08:47,808
Well, Marvin said we could use
some of his guys to help out.

1242
01:08:47,809 --> 01:08:50,727
Hey, guys! Hello?

1243
01:08:50,728 --> 01:08:54,263
I'm Carl. This is my truck.

1244
01:08:54,774 --> 01:08:56,441
I need some help moving
this equipment in.

1245
01:08:56,442 --> 01:08:59,016
Marvin said that you
guys might help me.

1246
01:09:01,906 --> 01:09:04,349
I got it. Mind if I borrow this?

1247
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:07,442
Get to the top floor.

1248
01:09:11,165 --> 01:09:13,738
Maybe a little higher?

1249
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:17,086
The hard part was getting
it over to the truck,

1250
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:19,199
and now we just have to tip.

1251
01:09:20,466 --> 01:09:23,384
If I can get one end
up on the tailgate.

1252
01:09:23,385 --> 01:09:24,927
OK.

1253
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:28,681
Oh, hey, hey. Don't do that. You're
gonna rupture something, man.

1254
01:09:28,682 --> 01:09:30,349
- Hey!
- Martin!

1255
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:34,061
Hey, killer, what's up? How you
doing, little gangster, huh?

1256
01:09:34,062 --> 01:09:36,814
- What the hell you doing here?
- I warned you, man. I warned you.

1257
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:40,401
If you got another gig, I was gonna drop
everything to be your line cook. Didn't I?

1258
01:09:40,402 --> 01:09:42,319
This is a food truck.
You're a sous-chef now.

1259
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,280
So? Food trucks don't
need a sous-chef?

1260
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:46,615
OK, fine. You're hired.
Pays nothing.

1261
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,159
- I'll take it.
- Nice!

1262
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,244
- You're not gonna scare me, buddy.
- Thank you so much.

1263
01:09:50,245 --> 01:09:53,163
You must've jumped on a plane
as soon as we got off the phone.

1264
01:09:53,164 --> 01:09:56,041
Dude, when I heard your voice,
I was like, "That's what I wanna do."

1265
01:09:56,042 --> 01:09:57,835
- I'm so happy you're here.
- Me too, man.

1266
01:09:57,836 --> 01:09:59,920
- We're trying to get this in the truck.
- Yeah?

1267
01:09:59,921 --> 01:10:02,798
I need some sort of,
like, lever and fulcrum.

1268
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:04,341
Come on, everybody.
Everybody together. Come on.

1269
01:10:04,342 --> 01:10:07,177
Holy sh... No, we can't do this.

1270
01:10:07,178 --> 01:10:09,972
No way, not without one of us
hurting ourselves. No, no, no, don't.

1271
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:11,640
Stop. Stop. I got it, I got it.

1272
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:13,308
Carl, easy.

1273
01:10:31,118 --> 01:10:33,495
- It's good to know Spanish.
- You gotta, man.

1274
01:10:33,496 --> 01:10:37,363
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

1275
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,506
- Ah!
- OK, good.

1276
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,050
- Nice.
- Fryer next?

1277
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:48,593
No, no, forget the
freaking fryer, man.

1278
01:10:48,594 --> 01:10:50,136
I'm gonna fill up
the propane tanks,

1279
01:10:50,137 --> 01:10:52,096
you go to the market...
get cerveza, not beer.

1280
01:10:52,097 --> 01:10:55,850
I can't go to the market. We gotta hook
up the fryer. Get rid of the steam pit.

1281
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:59,020
No, by the time you get back, I'll
have this all spotless and cleaned up.

1282
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:00,521
I got lots of marinating to do.

1283
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,606
I promised these people the
best sandwich of their lives.

1284
01:11:02,607 --> 01:11:04,108
- OK. Good. So...
- Get me the mojo.

1285
01:11:04,109 --> 01:11:06,026
OK, so, what do you need?
Oranges, onion, garlic.

1286
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:08,529
That's right. Why don't we
juice it up a little bit, huh?

1287
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,072
- Tomatillo.
- Some chillies, yeah. Cilantro.

1288
01:11:10,073 --> 01:11:12,783
- Now get the hell outta here.
- Let's go.

1289
01:11:12,784 --> 01:11:15,494
OK, look, the key is, you
gotta look for ingredients

1290
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:17,663
and then that gives you
ideas of what to cook.

1291
01:11:17,664 --> 01:11:19,540
Like, this is yucca, right?

1292
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,418
Get some of that. Those
look great. See that?

1293
01:11:22,419 --> 01:11:24,211
And... Oh, come here.

1294
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:26,046
You know what this is?

1295
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:27,673
Uh, bananas?

1296
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:29,883
That's called a plantain. Plátanos.

1297
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:31,635
These are maduros. Feel, soft?

1298
01:11:31,636 --> 01:11:33,470
- Mm-hm.
- That's the sweet kind.

1299
01:11:33,471 --> 01:11:36,264
But we want the green ones.
Here. Hang onto this.

1300
01:11:36,265 --> 01:11:38,183
This is what you
make tostones with.

1301
01:11:38,184 --> 01:11:40,143
That's Martin's favourite.

1302
01:11:40,144 --> 01:11:43,146
- I got it. I got it.
- You got it? Too much?

1303
01:11:43,147 --> 01:11:44,981
- I got it.
- OK.

1304
01:11:44,982 --> 01:11:47,442
- Watch out for tarantulas. Come on.
- What?

1305
01:12:26,523 --> 01:12:29,316
Ahh! That's good.

1306
01:12:29,317 --> 01:12:30,860
Oh, look at that.

1307
01:12:30,861 --> 01:12:34,405
Oh, yeah. My masterpiece, baby.

1308
01:12:34,406 --> 01:12:38,283
- That's beautiful.
- Miami, I am back. Pow!

1309
01:12:38,285 --> 01:12:42,270
You could have just bought this at
the store. I think they sold it there.

1310
01:12:43,206 --> 01:12:45,124
- You sure that's your son, man?
- I don't know.

1311
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:46,667
You'd better get a paternity test.

1312
01:12:46,668 --> 01:12:51,282
- Oh, that looks incred...
- Can I have some?

1313
01:12:51,798 --> 01:12:54,174
Oh, Martin.

1314
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,134
- Please, just gimme some.
- It's not from the store.

1315
01:12:56,135 --> 01:12:58,637
- You might not like it.
- It's fatty but not heavy, you know?

1316
01:12:58,638 --> 01:13:00,514
- You don't want any of this.
- Yes, I do.

1317
01:13:00,515 --> 01:13:02,557
- You're probably vegan. You can't eat it.
- I'm not vegan.

1318
01:13:02,558 --> 01:13:04,226
- It's not from the store.
- Oh, my God.

1319
01:13:04,227 --> 01:13:07,020
- Martin, come on. Can I have some?
- Hold on a second.

1320
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:09,481
- Can I give him a piece, Martin?
- Nah, man, he's not...

1321
01:13:09,482 --> 01:13:12,507
- Alright. Let me think about it.
- Just a little piece. Let's see.

1322
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,280
- Pretty good.
- Pretty good?

1323
01:13:17,281 --> 01:13:19,199
- Pretty good? Come on!
- Better than the store?

1324
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,783
One more. Just one more.

1325
01:13:20,784 --> 01:13:23,244
The best shit you ever had
in your life. Come on, man.

1326
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:26,122
Oh, give me another one. If you're
gonna give him some, give me some.

1327
01:13:26,123 --> 01:13:27,582
- Don't be cheap.
- I want more.

1328
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,083
You know what? Let's
make some sandwiches.

1329
01:13:29,084 --> 01:13:31,942
- Yes, sir. Let's get to it.
- Alright. Ready to go?

1330
01:13:32,796 --> 01:13:34,422
Hey, little man, is
the plancha red-hot?

1331
01:13:34,423 --> 01:13:37,049
- Huh?
- Me?

1332
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,624
No, I'm talking to the grill.
Yeah, you.

1333
01:13:40,137 --> 01:13:42,305
- Do I touch it?
- Well, what do you think?

1334
01:13:42,306 --> 01:13:44,807
- No.
- That's right. No, genius.

1335
01:13:44,808 --> 01:13:46,642
Hey, look. Come over here, look.

1336
01:13:46,643 --> 01:13:48,269
- See this water?
- Mm-hm.

1337
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:50,855
- Bang. Is it hot?
- Yes.

1338
01:13:50,856 --> 01:13:53,023
- Tell him it's hot.
- It's hot.

1339
01:13:53,024 --> 01:13:55,234
- OK.
- Is it hot as your daddy's underwear?

1340
01:13:55,235 --> 01:13:56,777
Good. Now, watch. Come over here.

1341
01:13:56,778 --> 01:13:58,696
Here we go, papi.
Perfect. Perfecto.

1342
01:13:58,697 --> 01:14:00,614
Now, watch me.
Watch what I'm doing.

1343
01:14:00,615 --> 01:14:02,241
Two slices of ham, three of pork.

1344
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:04,118
- Now come over here.
- Now the maestro.

1345
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:06,870
Two slices of cheese... one, two.

1346
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:09,206
- Two pickles.
- Can I do pickles?

1347
01:14:09,207 --> 01:14:11,166
Big pickles. Nice. One, two.

1348
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:14,044
Now, watch this. Take this...
mustard, from end to end.

1349
01:14:14,045 --> 01:14:15,420
OK.

1350
01:14:15,421 --> 01:14:17,339
You go side to side,
not forward and back.

1351
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,299
Now, this is the
most important part.

1352
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,551
- This is what makes it a Cubano.
- OK.

1353
01:14:21,552 --> 01:14:23,428
- Take the butter. See that?
- Yeah.

1354
01:14:23,429 --> 01:14:26,431
On top. Take a little bit.

1355
01:14:26,432 --> 01:14:28,975
Butter the grill.

1356
01:14:28,976 --> 01:14:31,061
In. Just like that.

1357
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:33,104
Now, watch.

1358
01:14:33,105 --> 01:14:35,440
I want you to watch for
the bread to get golden.

1359
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:37,442
I want you to watch for
the cheese to melt.

1360
01:14:37,443 --> 01:14:39,944
When that cheese is melted and that
bread's golden, but not burnt,

1361
01:14:39,945 --> 01:14:42,447
you call me, you tell me it's
done and we'll check, OK?

1362
01:14:42,448 --> 01:14:44,606
- OK.
- Keep an eye on it.

1363
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:55,793
I want you to watch
everything everybody's doing,

1364
01:14:55,794 --> 01:14:59,088
because when we're hopping, you're
gonna have to jump in on the line

1365
01:14:59,089 --> 01:15:00,631
and help out.

1366
01:15:00,632 --> 01:15:03,657
- I think it's done.
- You think it's done?

1367
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:08,347
- Oh, look at that.
- See how golden that is?

1368
01:15:08,348 --> 01:15:10,266
- That's how you want it every time.
- Nice job.

1369
01:15:10,267 --> 01:15:12,601
You gotta be like a robot
when you're on a line.

1370
01:15:12,602 --> 01:15:14,103
You're the shit, baby.
You're the shit.

1371
01:15:14,104 --> 01:15:15,145
OK?

1372
01:15:15,147 --> 01:15:18,357
Mmm! Three equal pieces.

1373
01:15:18,358 --> 01:15:20,651
- Let's see what we got.
- Alright, here we go.

1374
01:15:20,652 --> 01:15:23,153
- Oh, hot.
- Ah. Let me see.

1375
01:15:23,154 --> 01:15:24,947
Look at that cheese.

1376
01:15:24,948 --> 01:15:27,324
- Oh, my God, man.
- This is the shit.

1377
01:15:27,325 --> 01:15:29,201
- This is it.
- Oh!

1378
01:15:29,202 --> 01:15:30,827
- This is it.
- This is it.

1379
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:33,830
- It's incredible.
- This is empingao.

1380
01:15:33,831 --> 01:15:36,416
- Oh, empingao!
- Empingao, man.

1381
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:39,294
- So, is it good?
- It's amazing.

1382
01:15:39,295 --> 01:15:41,505
Then I guess we're open.

1383
01:15:41,506 --> 01:15:44,198
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. We're open?

1384
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:47,511
I didn't get to finish my sandwich.

1385
01:15:47,512 --> 01:15:49,763
- Here you go.
- What do I do?

1386
01:15:49,764 --> 01:15:51,473
Cut the bread.

1387
01:15:51,474 --> 01:15:53,016
There's cerveza down there.

1388
01:15:53,017 --> 01:15:55,185
Little man, get me hazelnuts,
get me some more ham.

1389
01:15:55,186 --> 01:15:56,770
OK.

1390
01:15:59,106 --> 01:16:01,441
Alright, I got four right here.

1391
01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:14,746
Hey, jefe, this sound
system sounds like ass.

1392
01:16:14,747 --> 01:16:17,874
But my cousin knows a guy who'll hook
us up with all our musical necessities.

1393
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:20,626
My credit cards are maxed out and
we're not charging for food yet.

1394
01:16:20,627 --> 01:16:23,504
- So we'll wait on the sound system.
- But you look happy, baby, don't you?

1395
01:16:23,505 --> 01:16:25,840
- So happy. So happy.
- Yeah, that's what's champing it.

1396
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:27,383
Uh-huh!

1397
01:16:27,384 --> 01:16:29,677
- I got one.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1398
01:16:29,678 --> 01:16:31,262
- That's burnt.
- So?

1399
01:16:31,263 --> 01:16:33,597
They're not paying for it.

1400
01:16:33,598 --> 01:16:36,100
Come with me. Get off the truck.

1401
01:16:36,101 --> 01:16:38,435
- You got this?
- Yeah, I got it. You get down.

1402
01:16:38,436 --> 01:16:40,797
Slow down for a second.

1403
01:16:42,274 --> 01:16:45,025
- Is this boring to you?
- No, I like it.

1404
01:16:45,026 --> 01:16:46,568
Yeah, well, I love it.

1405
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:49,404
Everything good that's happened to
me in my life came because of that.

1406
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:52,366
I might not do everything
great in my life, OK?

1407
01:16:52,367 --> 01:16:54,534
I'm not perfect. I'm
not the best husband.

1408
01:16:54,536 --> 01:16:57,394
And I'm sorry if I
wasn't the best father.

1409
01:16:58,873 --> 01:17:00,948
But I'm good at this.

1410
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:04,211
And I wanna share this with you.

1411
01:17:04,212 --> 01:17:06,546
I wanna teach you what I learned.

1412
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:09,868
I get to touch people's
lives with what I do.

1413
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:13,035
And it keeps me
going, and I love it.

1414
01:17:13,554 --> 01:17:16,473
And I think if you give it a
shot, you might love it too.

1415
01:17:16,474 --> 01:17:18,549
Yes, Chef.

1416
01:17:19,352 --> 01:17:21,144
Now, should we have
served that sandwich?

1417
01:17:21,145 --> 01:17:23,469
No, Chef.

1418
01:17:24,315 --> 01:17:26,816
That's my son. Get back in there.
We got some hungry people.

1419
01:17:26,817 --> 01:17:28,892
He's ready to cook!

1420
01:17:29,904 --> 01:17:31,821
- We did good, man.
- We did good.

1421
01:17:31,822 --> 01:17:34,323
- We got something here.
- I say we stick with the traditional menu.

1422
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:36,409
- We don't get too fancy.
- We'll get some yucca fries.

1423
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,536
- We got the fryer.
- That's classic. Another beer, boss?

1424
01:17:38,537 --> 01:17:40,731
- No, I'm good.
- Alright.

1425
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:45,918
Here you go, little man.

1426
01:17:45,919 --> 01:17:47,994
You sure?

1427
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:51,340
Is this beer?

1428
01:17:51,341 --> 01:17:53,426
No, of course not. I would
never hand you beer.

1429
01:17:53,427 --> 01:17:56,262
- That's cerveza.
- I'm 10. I can't have beer.

1430
01:17:56,263 --> 01:18:00,474
You're not 10. You're kitchen staff.
Kitchen staff doesn't have an age.

1431
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:02,643
Dad?

1432
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:04,719
You can have a sip.

1433
01:18:07,065 --> 01:18:08,607
Huh?

1434
01:18:08,608 --> 01:18:10,275
- Like piss, right?
- Worse.

1435
01:18:10,276 --> 01:18:12,361
You remember that when your
friends offer you a beer.

1436
01:18:12,362 --> 01:18:14,029
- I figure we go to South Beach...
- Mm-hm.

1437
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:16,406
stake out the truck a little
bit, get the menu straight.

1438
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:18,450
Then after we're really confident
we got something good,

1439
01:18:18,451 --> 01:18:19,993
then we drive back to LA.

1440
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:21,953
And hit a few extra
cities on the way?

1441
01:18:21,954 --> 01:18:23,497
Why not?

1442
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,707
- Can I come?
- Can you come?

1443
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,542
- Come where?
- On the trip.

1444
01:18:27,543 --> 01:18:29,628
This isn't a trip. We're
just driving the truck back.

1445
01:18:29,629 --> 01:18:32,214
You're flying first class with
Mommy with all the divorce money.

1446
01:18:32,215 --> 01:18:34,257
Yeah, but you're
stopping in cities.

1447
01:18:34,258 --> 01:18:36,915
- Yeah, but you got school.
- I'm on break.

1448
01:18:37,428 --> 01:18:38,970
I don't know.

1449
01:18:38,971 --> 01:18:40,889
Martin, I like your mojo.

1450
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:43,016
- Hey, don't work me.
- Oh, you hitting Martin?

1451
01:18:43,017 --> 01:18:44,934
- You're working Martin?
- Working me like that.

1452
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:46,853
- He's ice-cold.
- He knows my soft spot, though.

1453
01:18:46,854 --> 01:18:48,396
He likes your mojo.

1454
01:18:48,397 --> 01:18:50,315
- He got me, man.
- We'll talk to your mom.

1455
01:18:50,316 --> 01:18:52,066
- We'll see what she says.
- I already did.

1456
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:53,818
- She's cool with it.
- Look at that.

1457
01:18:53,819 --> 01:18:55,486
He's not... He's 10,
he's got a phone.

1458
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,905
Good for you. Good for
you, man. Get things done.

1459
01:19:00,325 --> 01:19:02,577
Why not? Why not? Bring him along.

1460
01:19:02,578 --> 01:19:04,662
So I'm going?

1461
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:06,747
Yeah.

1462
01:19:06,748 --> 01:19:09,083
- Yeah, you can come.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

1463
01:19:09,084 --> 01:19:11,361
Go by the backhoe.

1464
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:14,463
You want me to take
a poop over there?

1465
01:19:14,464 --> 01:19:16,006
Hey, Carl. Carl, check it out.

1466
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:17,675
I'll drop you guys
off at the hotel,

1467
01:19:17,676 --> 01:19:20,177
and in the morning, you go get
the rest of the ingredients,

1468
01:19:20,178 --> 01:19:22,888
stock up on stuff, and I'll
put a coat of paint on this.

1469
01:19:22,889 --> 01:19:24,974
Don't bother painting. We'll
paint it when we get back.

1470
01:19:24,975 --> 01:19:27,309
- It looks fine like this.
- No, man. This is on me.

1471
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:29,645
My cousin knows a guy. I'm
gonna hook it up. Alright?

1472
01:19:29,646 --> 01:19:31,188
OK.

1473
01:19:54,629 --> 01:19:56,838
Who's hungry? Huh?

1474
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:59,758
If you change your mind, you call
me and I'll go get you anywhere.

1475
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:02,119
Come on. Let's sell
sandwiches, baby!

1476
01:20:04,764 --> 01:20:06,931
- OK, call me.
- Come on, buddy.

1477
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:09,183
Cuidado.

1478
01:20:09,185 --> 01:20:11,378
- Call me.
- I will.

1479
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:49,139
Alright, buddy, I need
you to get me a crowd.

1480
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,016
- Yes, Chef. You know it.
- Alright.

1481
01:20:51,017 --> 01:20:54,019
Step right up.

1482
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,812
Best Cuban food in
all of South Beach.

1483
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:57,523
Come on, don't be afraid. Step up!

1484
01:20:57,524 --> 01:21:01,485
If you need it more authentic,
you can swim 90 miles that way.

1485
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:07,282
If you can pronounce
it, we can make it.

1486
01:21:07,283 --> 01:21:10,535
Arroz con pollo, yuca frita.

1487
01:21:10,536 --> 01:21:13,288
OK, four media noches coming up.

1488
01:21:13,289 --> 01:21:15,081
Cubano.

1489
01:21:15,082 --> 01:21:17,000
- You got it?
- I got four ready over here.

1490
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:18,627
- Yucca fries, plantas was you?
- Yeah.

1491
01:21:18,628 --> 01:21:20,545
Here we go. Thank you.
Thanks for your patience.

1492
01:21:20,546 --> 01:21:23,048
- Who needs a little bit more?
- We got four Cubano all day.

1493
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:25,133
- Four Cubano all day.
- Hey, this one's not ready, OK?

1494
01:21:25,134 --> 01:21:27,218
- I'm buttering that one.
- I got it. I got it.

1495
01:21:27,219 --> 01:21:28,761
- Crap!
- Yucca!

1496
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:30,430
- One frites for you.
- I burned my finger.

1497
01:21:30,431 --> 01:21:31,973
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

1498
01:21:31,974 --> 01:21:33,641
- You wanna keep going or stop?
- Keep going.

1499
01:21:33,642 --> 01:21:35,351
- OK, keep going, keep going.
- Go, little man.

1500
01:21:35,352 --> 01:21:37,311
Help him with that banana
ketchup and yucca fries.

1501
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:38,855
Go with the chile,
the chile vinegar.

1502
01:21:38,856 --> 01:21:40,898
- Good job.
- Hold on one second.

1503
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:42,525
- It's coming.
- Is that enough?

1504
01:21:42,526 --> 01:21:44,235
That's perfect. Here you go.

1505
01:21:44,236 --> 01:21:47,059
- How's the yucca frita?
- It's perfect.

1506
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:06,548
Step aside, step aside.

1507
01:22:06,549 --> 01:22:08,676
Thank you.

1508
01:22:08,677 --> 01:22:10,219
Who's in charge here?

1509
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:12,846
Um, uh, me. What do you need, sir?

1510
01:22:12,847 --> 01:22:14,932
- I need to talk to you on the side.
- OK.

1511
01:22:14,933 --> 01:22:18,060
- On the side, please. Right away.
- I got you. I got it, I got it.

1512
01:22:20,688 --> 01:22:25,317
Alright, alright. Relax, relax.
Keep it down. Keep it down.

1513
01:22:25,318 --> 01:22:27,944
Hang on, guys. Come on.
Hang on, hang on.

1514
01:22:27,945 --> 01:22:29,571
Hang on, hang on.

1515
01:22:29,572 --> 01:22:32,430
- Need to see a permit.
- Permit, yeah, we got it.

1516
01:22:37,163 --> 01:22:38,872
Should be good.

1517
01:22:38,873 --> 01:22:41,833
Yeah, permit's good. You're just
not good to sell here right now.

1518
01:22:41,834 --> 01:22:44,586
OK, alright. Thank you. So just,
what, a half-mile down the road?

1519
01:22:44,587 --> 01:22:47,172
Yeah. As long as you're not right
on South Beach, you're OK.

1520
01:22:47,173 --> 01:22:49,497
- No problem. Sorry about that.
- Hey...

1521
01:22:50,009 --> 01:22:52,719
Aren't you the lava cake guy?

1522
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:56,055
- Uh, yeah, from the internet.
- Yeah.

1523
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:58,683
Yeah.

1524
01:22:58,684 --> 01:23:01,227
My kid and I saw you on 'Tosh.0'.
You were hilarious.

1525
01:23:01,228 --> 01:23:03,646
Thanks. OK, great.

1526
01:23:03,647 --> 01:23:05,106
- That was hilarious.
- OK.

1527
01:23:05,107 --> 01:23:08,276
Hey, can I get a quick
picture with you for my kid?

1528
01:23:08,277 --> 01:23:09,944
- For my kid.
- Sure.

1529
01:23:09,945 --> 01:23:11,696
- Yeah.
- Hey, you know how to work this?

1530
01:23:11,697 --> 01:23:14,198
- Hey, Martin, help me out.
- What is that, a flat-screen TV?

1531
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:17,224
Hold on a second. Let me
unlock it for you real quick.

1532
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:20,788
Hang on. We're gonna
move it down the road.

1533
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:22,456
It's hard to use other
people's technology.

1534
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:24,542
- Big one.
- Arm around you? Is that good?

1535
01:23:24,543 --> 01:23:26,669
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Alright, how do I... What do I press?

1536
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,587
Just touch the... Tap the
screen first. Hold on.

1537
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:30,506
- OK.
- Let me make sure it's not on video.

1538
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:33,425
It's on... Yeah, it's on. And then
put on camera. There we go. Yeah.

1539
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:34,885
Alright. Get together.

1540
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:36,804
You have to tap the
centre of the screen,

1541
01:23:36,805 --> 01:23:39,723
and when you see a box, make
sure the box is around our head.

1542
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,266
- OK.
- Whatever you're shooting's in the box.

1543
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,185
- Just take the fucking picture, OK?
- I got it.

1544
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:44,895
- There we go.
- Thanks. Let's take the...

1545
01:23:44,896 --> 01:23:46,813
Oh, and your finger's
in front of the camera.

1546
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,565
- Sorry, sorry!
- Good. Great.

1547
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:50,108
- I got it.
- OK. Thank you.

1548
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:51,651
- Alright. Thank you.
- Thank you, Officer.

1549
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:54,863
Hey, can I just take a picture
up there in the kitchen?

1550
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:57,157
- On the truck?
- That'd be great, yeah.

1551
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:58,617
- Got it.
- And good. OK.

1552
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,744
Can I take one pressing a
sandwich or something?

1553
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:02,537
- Got it.
- Good? OK.
- Alright.

1554
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:05,123
Can we do one more where...
with 'Lady and the Tramp'...

1555
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:07,292
you know, you're biting one
end, I'm biting the other?

1556
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:09,487
- Come on, you can do this.
- OK.

1557
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:32,716
You got it? You got it? Go.

1558
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,978
I think I missed the exit.

1559
01:24:46,727 --> 01:24:48,317
Oww!

1560
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,677
What the hell are you doing?
You sending pictures to Mom?

1561
01:25:00,678 --> 01:25:03,055
- I'm posting a Vine.
- A Vine? What's a Vine?

1562
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,515
It's a video. Look.

1563
01:25:05,516 --> 01:25:07,601
Hey, come on, man!
Get that out of my face.

1564
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,020
- Seriously.
- Christ.

1565
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:12,856
- It's only six seconds.
- Who'd make a video six seconds?

1566
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:15,233
- A six-second video.
- Can you believe this generation?

1567
01:25:15,234 --> 01:25:17,652
Unbelievable, man.
Little attention. ADHD.

1568
01:25:17,653 --> 01:25:19,696
- ADHD is right.
- That's nothing.

1569
01:25:19,697 --> 01:25:22,240
I've also been shooting these videos...
one second every day.

1570
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:24,117
One-second videos?
Now you're joking with me.

1571
01:25:24,118 --> 01:25:25,869
No. You edit 'em all together.

1572
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,537
One second of every day.

1573
01:25:27,538 --> 01:25:29,956
And then you cut 'em together
and watch it. It's cool.

1574
01:25:29,957 --> 01:25:32,417
OK, enough with the virtual world.
How about something real?

1575
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:34,043
Who wants to stop at Disney World?

1576
01:25:34,044 --> 01:25:37,171
- Oh, yeah, I do.
- Disney World? That's real?

1577
01:25:37,172 --> 01:25:38,923
We shouldn't stop till
we hit New Orleans.

1578
01:25:38,924 --> 01:25:41,050
- Hey! Hey, that is your son.
- That's my boy.

1579
01:25:41,051 --> 01:25:43,386
A kid who'd rather go to New
Orleans than Disney World.

1580
01:25:43,387 --> 01:25:44,887
Now I've seen everything.

1581
01:25:44,888 --> 01:25:46,597
I can't wait to try
my first beignet.

1582
01:25:46,598 --> 01:25:49,100
Every other person you say 'New
Orleans' to thinks jazz and voodoo.

1583
01:25:49,101 --> 01:25:50,518
Yeah, he thinks...

1584
01:25:50,519 --> 01:25:52,687
- Your kid thinks doughnuts.
- Doughnuts. Yeah, I know.

1585
01:25:52,688 --> 01:25:55,759
I like that. Alright, New Orleans.

1586
01:26:22,592 --> 01:26:24,885
What are you doing?

1587
01:26:24,886 --> 01:26:27,888
Dude, I'm putting a little
cornstarch on my werewolves, man.

1588
01:26:27,889 --> 01:26:29,473
It's too humid down here.

1589
01:26:31,601 --> 01:26:33,810
Dad. Dad.

1590
01:26:33,811 --> 01:26:35,270
- Wake up.
- What?

1591
01:26:35,271 --> 01:26:37,880
Martin's putting
cornstarch on his balls.

1592
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,817
You putting cornstarch
on your balls?

1593
01:26:40,818 --> 01:26:42,893
Yes, sir.

1594
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:45,646
Let me get some?

1595
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:58,626
Want some?

1596
01:26:58,627 --> 01:27:00,702
Here.

1597
01:27:01,422 --> 01:27:02,964
It's like baby powder.

1598
01:27:02,965 --> 01:27:04,576
Put it on your nuts.

1599
01:27:07,052 --> 01:27:09,387
- It's nice, right?
- Nice.

1600
01:27:09,388 --> 01:27:11,055
What's good is in the morning,

1601
01:27:11,056 --> 01:27:13,266
you could dip your nuts in
oil and make hushpuppies.

1602
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:46,506
Alright, come on. Come on.

1603
01:27:47,133 --> 01:27:49,384
Out.

1604
01:27:49,385 --> 01:27:51,678
Alright, backing up.

1605
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,253
Come on, come on.

1606
01:27:55,558 --> 01:27:57,633
OK, watch out, baby-cakes.

1607
01:27:58,853 --> 01:28:00,395
OK.

1608
01:28:00,396 --> 01:28:02,508
Whoo!

1609
01:28:03,024 --> 01:28:05,358
Nice driving skills, huh?

1610
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:07,444
- I'm getting the hang of this thing.
- I'm telling ya.

1611
01:28:07,445 --> 01:28:09,362
- Alright, I'm taking my kid for a walk.
- Yeah.

1612
01:28:09,363 --> 01:28:11,489
Oh, nice. I get
promoted to sous-chef.

1613
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,575
- But I gotta do all the hard work?
- Yeah. Thanks.

1614
01:28:13,576 --> 01:28:15,326
- Thank you.
- Where are we, Bourbon Street?

1615
01:28:15,327 --> 01:28:17,787
Nah, this is Frenchman Street.
Bourbon's for tourists.

1616
01:28:17,788 --> 01:28:20,279
We're in the Marigny. Come with me.

1617
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:23,292
- Where we going?
- Just come.

1618
01:28:23,294 --> 01:28:25,238
Come on. French Quarter.

1619
01:28:25,754 --> 01:28:28,993
We're going to Café Du Monde.

1620
01:28:29,842 --> 01:28:32,051
You ever heard of Café Du Monde?

1621
01:28:32,052 --> 01:28:34,661
Is this the beignet place?

1622
01:28:44,898 --> 01:28:48,267
You ready? We drove a
long way for these.

1623
01:28:49,402 --> 01:28:50,986
Here we go.

1624
01:28:50,987 --> 01:28:52,696
Eat it slow.

1625
01:28:52,697 --> 01:28:54,907
You're never gonna have
your first beignet ever again.

1626
01:28:54,908 --> 01:28:56,492
Pretty cool.

1627
01:28:56,493 --> 01:28:59,286
- It's cool, right? You like it?
- Mm-hm.

1628
01:28:59,287 --> 01:29:01,979
They don't taste like this
anywhere else in the world.

1629
01:29:02,499 --> 01:29:05,042
- So, what else you gotta buy?
- Nothing.

1630
01:29:05,043 --> 01:29:06,752
Not anything for work?

1631
01:29:06,753 --> 01:29:08,503
Nope.

1632
01:29:08,504 --> 01:29:10,547
- Really?
- Nah.

1633
01:29:10,548 --> 01:29:12,591
Just wanted to get some
beignets with you.

1634
01:29:12,592 --> 01:29:14,667
Cool.

1635
01:29:15,178 --> 01:29:16,887
I like New Orleans.

1636
01:29:16,888 --> 01:29:19,097
I like New Orleans too.

1637
01:29:19,098 --> 01:29:22,726
- Somebody ate my body.
- I didn't brush my teeth.

1638
01:29:22,727 --> 01:29:25,395
This is what happens to you when
you don't brush your teeth.

1639
01:29:25,396 --> 01:29:28,064
- Dude, dude! Where were you, man?
- What? I went shopping.

1640
01:29:28,065 --> 01:29:30,191
- You went shopping?
- I called you, man. I texted you.

1641
01:29:30,192 --> 01:29:31,860
- We got beignets.
- Where the hell were you?

1642
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:34,571
- You got beignets? I've been calling.
- We got some beets for the truck.

1643
01:29:34,572 --> 01:29:36,823
- Why didn't you answer your phone?
- My phone was on vibrate.

1644
01:29:36,824 --> 01:29:39,075
- You put your phone on vibrate.
- Chill out. What's the big...

1645
01:29:39,076 --> 01:29:40,910
- I'm sorry.
- Chill out? Just take a look.

1646
01:29:40,911 --> 01:29:42,954
Take a look. Please take a look.

1647
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,002
- Is that for us?
- That's for us.

1648
01:29:50,003 --> 01:29:52,964
- That whole line's for us?
- Can you believe that?

1649
01:29:52,965 --> 01:29:54,507
Oh, my God!

1650
01:29:54,508 --> 01:29:56,592
Alright, so, I guess we
gotta cook some food.

1651
01:29:56,593 --> 01:29:58,928
- We gotta cook some food.
- Alright, so you good with prep?

1652
01:29:58,929 --> 01:30:00,596
- Yes, sir.
- We're gonna get through this.

1653
01:30:00,597 --> 01:30:02,098
- You ready?
- I'm ready, boss.

1654
01:30:02,099 --> 01:30:03,599
- OK. Buy me five minutes.
- Yes, sir.

1655
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,684
Could you give us five minutes,
please? Five minutes.

1656
01:30:05,685 --> 01:30:07,728
We'll be right there
in five more minutes.

1657
01:30:07,729 --> 01:30:10,314
Got everything... Plancha's...
Everything's hot.

1658
01:30:10,315 --> 01:30:13,150
- Oil's hot. You got everything ready.
- Yes, sir.

1659
01:30:13,151 --> 01:30:14,693
You are a superstar!

1660
01:30:14,694 --> 01:30:17,112
- You are a superstar.
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1661
01:30:17,113 --> 01:30:20,449
Oh! And how'd you get that crowd?
You got a huge crowd outside.

1662
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:23,202
I didn't. I just came back from
shopping, there was this long line.

1663
01:30:23,203 --> 01:30:25,662
- I thought it was a mistake.
- I tweeted it.

1664
01:30:25,663 --> 01:30:27,988
- You what?
- What'd you do?

1665
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:32,336
I tweeted the picture on your account
and then geotagged it. Look.

1666
01:30:32,337 --> 01:30:34,338
Wait, man, you did...
you did what? You geo...

1667
01:30:34,339 --> 01:30:37,257
I tagged it so they can
mark us on their maps.

1668
01:30:37,258 --> 01:30:39,468
Look at those pictures.

1669
01:30:39,469 --> 01:30:41,011
How'd you... What'd you...

1670
01:30:41,012 --> 01:30:42,554
- These pictures are from here.
- Mm-hm.

1671
01:30:42,555 --> 01:30:44,055
How'd you get those
pictures from here?

1672
01:30:44,056 --> 01:30:45,890
When I was going to Café Du Monde.

1673
01:30:45,892 --> 01:30:47,892
- And you put it online?
- Mm-hm.

1674
01:30:47,893 --> 01:30:49,853
You're a genius, kid.

1675
01:30:49,854 --> 01:30:52,355
You're the reason everybody's
here. You know that?

1676
01:30:52,356 --> 01:30:54,983
You're my new head of
marketing. Thank you.

1677
01:30:54,984 --> 01:30:56,860
Alright, so, I'm gonna
hit the chalkboard.

1678
01:30:56,861 --> 01:31:00,029
You walk him through the prep on the
po' boys and get the plancha going.

1679
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:02,198
Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef. Jefecito.

1680
01:31:02,199 --> 01:31:04,492
You butter the
plancha, son, alright?

1681
01:31:04,493 --> 01:31:07,203
I got this. Percy, look. Whoo!

1682
01:31:07,204 --> 01:31:09,363
Yes, sir.

1683
01:31:12,084 --> 01:31:14,752
Single file, y'all. Right here.

1684
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:18,798
0-8? There you go. Thank you
very much. Napkins are down there.

1685
01:31:18,799 --> 01:31:21,092
- Another beignet coming up.
- Hang on a second.

1686
01:31:21,093 --> 01:31:23,052
- Number seven.
- There you go, two more.

1687
01:31:23,053 --> 01:31:24,595
Cubano coming up.

1688
01:31:24,596 --> 01:31:27,973
Hang on, one second.
He's my kid. He's just learning.

1689
01:31:27,974 --> 01:31:30,267
- Put you on the Twitter?
- Watch your back.

1690
01:31:30,268 --> 01:31:31,727
That's my kid. He did all that.

1691
01:31:31,728 --> 01:31:34,396
- More beignets.
- How's that po' boy coming?

1692
01:31:34,397 --> 01:31:36,440
- It's coming up with shrimp.
- Alright.

1693
01:31:36,441 --> 01:31:38,817
It's worth the wait, I promise.

1694
01:32:16,355 --> 01:32:19,399
<i>Baby</i>

1695
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,151
<i>I'm hot just like an oven</i>

1696
01:32:22,152 --> 01:32:24,904
<i>I need some lovin'</i>

1697
01:32:24,905 --> 01:32:28,783
<i>And, baby</i>

1698
01:32:28,784 --> 01:32:31,494
<i>I can't hold it much longer</i>

1699
01:32:31,495 --> 01:32:34,580
<i>It's getting
stronger and stronger</i>

1700
01:32:34,581 --> 01:32:39,085
<i>And when I get that feelin',
I want sexual healing</i>

1701
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:44,090
<i>Sexual healing is good for me</i>

1702
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:48,124
<i>Makes me feel so fine</i>

1703
01:32:48,762 --> 01:32:51,972
<i>Helps to relieve my mind</i>

1704
01:32:51,973 --> 01:32:53,182
<i>Yeah</i>

1705
01:32:53,183 --> 01:32:57,728
<i>Sexual healing,
baby, is good for me</i>

1706
01:32:57,729 --> 01:33:02,649
<i>Sexual healing is something
that's good for me</i>

1707
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:07,112
<i>Whenever blue
teardrops are falling</i>

1708
01:33:07,113 --> 01:33:11,992
<i>And my emotional
stability is leaving me</i>

1709
01:33:11,993 --> 01:33:15,370
<i>There is something I can do</i>

1710
01:33:15,371 --> 01:33:20,625
<i>I can get on the telephone
and call you up, baby</i>

1711
01:33:20,626 --> 01:33:25,797
<i>Honey, I know you'll
be there to relieve me</i>

1712
01:33:25,798 --> 01:33:29,301
<i>The love you give to me will...</i>

1713
01:33:29,302 --> 01:33:31,261
Jefe, jefe. It says
'sold out', man.

1714
01:33:31,262 --> 01:33:34,369
We should be good. I think
they're holding for us.

1715
01:33:35,599 --> 01:33:37,142
- Hey, Benji.
- Hey.

1716
01:33:37,143 --> 01:33:39,644
- We got here as fast as we could.
- Hopefully we're still good.

1717
01:33:39,645 --> 01:33:41,729
- You got anything for me?
- Gotta check with the man.

1718
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:43,273
- In the back.
- OK, thanks.

1719
01:33:43,274 --> 01:33:45,349
What's up, killer?

1720
01:33:48,362 --> 01:33:51,072
- Hey, Aaron.
- What's up, Carl?

1721
01:33:51,073 --> 01:33:52,532
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

1722
01:33:52,533 --> 01:33:54,075
Driving all night. Doing good.

1723
01:33:54,076 --> 01:33:55,743
- You still got the stuff?
- Let's do it.

1724
01:33:55,744 --> 01:33:57,411
Oh. He's got the stuff.

1725
01:33:57,412 --> 01:34:01,165
- What is this place?
- This is Texas OG barbecue.

1726
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:05,151
These guys gotta stay up all night
and stoke those fires low and slow.

1727
01:34:05,671 --> 01:34:07,864
Oh, man, that's gorgeous.

1728
01:34:08,465 --> 01:34:11,091
- So how many can I get?
- I guess four.

1729
01:34:11,093 --> 01:34:12,593
- I'll take it.
- Alright.

1730
01:34:12,594 --> 01:34:14,705
Whoo!

1731
01:34:15,305 --> 01:34:17,181
- Nice.
- Oh, yeah.

1732
01:34:17,182 --> 01:34:20,088
Yeah. Oh, there we go.

1733
01:34:21,394 --> 01:34:23,395
Oh, oh!

1734
01:34:23,396 --> 01:34:25,647
- Oh, man.
- Mmm!

1735
01:34:25,648 --> 01:34:28,108
Mmm. We should get some sliders.

1736
01:34:28,109 --> 01:34:29,735
- Wow.
- We should do sliders, man.

1737
01:34:29,736 --> 01:34:32,196
- Oh, my God.
- We get some King's Hawaiian bread.

1738
01:34:32,197 --> 01:34:33,739
- Mm-hm.
- Pickle, barbecue sauce.

1739
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:36,491
What if we swapped this out for
the pork in the media noche?

1740
01:34:36,492 --> 01:34:39,244
- What do you think about that?
- Swap this for the pork shoulder?

1741
01:34:39,245 --> 01:34:40,912
- Make, like, an Austin Midnight.
- I like that.

1742
01:34:40,913 --> 01:34:42,831
- That's hot. I like that.
- That is hot, baby.

1743
01:34:42,832 --> 01:34:45,333
Let me get one more of these.
You should check this out.

1744
01:34:45,334 --> 01:34:47,419
- Just let me cut right through.
- Mmm.

1745
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:49,337
- Save it, dog.
- I know. We're gonna save it.

1746
01:34:49,338 --> 01:34:51,256
- Use it all up, man.
- I'll give you half.

1747
01:34:51,257 --> 01:34:54,708
- Know you can't eat your own supply.
- Put it away after this.

1748
01:35:11,193 --> 01:35:14,195
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1749
01:35:14,196 --> 01:35:17,198
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1750
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:22,954
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1751
01:35:22,955 --> 01:35:24,830
<i>Yeah</i>

1752
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:30,407
<i>Travis County took my picture
but, no, I didn't smile</i>

1753
01:35:30,921 --> 01:35:36,675
<i>They told me I was gonna be
here for a pretty long while</i>

1754
01:35:36,676 --> 01:35:39,261
<i>One day, I was
walking down the street</i>

1755
01:35:39,262 --> 01:35:42,598
<i>When I should've been
walking down the hall...</i>

1756
01:35:42,599 --> 01:35:45,309
- Six sliders all day.
- 69's coming up.

1757
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:48,465
Ah! One is coming up.

1758
01:35:49,814 --> 01:35:51,565
Media noche, Texas.

1759
01:35:51,566 --> 01:35:54,401
- Whoo!
- This is getting murdered.

1760
01:35:54,402 --> 01:35:56,486
You got that three media
noches coming up?

1761
01:35:56,487 --> 01:35:57,863
Alright.

1762
01:35:57,864 --> 01:36:01,491
Order 65 and 66.

1763
01:36:01,492 --> 01:36:04,119
- I got po' boy right here.
- One sec.

1764
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,662
- You got the transfer pan?
- Cubano.

1765
01:36:05,663 --> 01:36:07,330
Thank you. Good. Hey, your
phone's ringing, Percy.

1766
01:36:07,331 --> 01:36:09,692
Sorry.

1767
01:36:12,295 --> 01:36:14,337
- Hey, Mom.
- Where are you?

1768
01:36:14,338 --> 01:36:16,840
- I'm in Austin.
- Are you OK?

1769
01:36:16,841 --> 01:36:18,758
- I'm great.
- How's your daddy?

1770
01:36:18,759 --> 01:36:20,802
Here, talk to him.

1771
01:36:20,803 --> 01:36:22,345
- Hi, Inez.
- Hi.

1772
01:36:22,346 --> 01:36:25,139
- You want me to pick him up?
- No, you're a thousand miles away.

1773
01:36:25,141 --> 01:36:27,892
It's OK. I can go get on
a plane and pick him up.

1774
01:36:27,893 --> 01:36:29,811
- No, it's fine. He's doing great.
- "I miss him.

1775
01:36:29,812 --> 01:36:32,021
"I want you to come home.
I love him."

1776
01:36:32,022 --> 01:36:35,316
He's fine. He's got a couple of burns
and two stitches from a paring knife.

1777
01:36:35,317 --> 01:36:37,443
Please, I'm serious.
Let me go and pick him up.

1778
01:36:37,444 --> 01:36:39,320
You know your son's a cook now?

1779
01:36:39,321 --> 01:36:41,614
- I'm a line cook.
- He's a line cook.

1780
01:36:41,615 --> 01:36:43,157
Be careful!

1781
01:36:43,158 --> 01:36:44,825
I'll have him home
in time for school.

1782
01:36:44,826 --> 01:36:47,536
- And you? Are you OK?
- I'm amazing!

1783
01:36:47,537 --> 01:36:51,665
"Oh, you're so sexy in that bandana.
I want your big platanos."

1784
01:36:51,666 --> 01:36:54,335
Looks here like you guys
are having so much fun.

1785
01:36:54,336 --> 01:36:57,254
Alright, give me one second. Did you
know your son could work a grill?

1786
01:36:57,255 --> 01:36:58,797
- I had beer.
- What did he say?

1787
01:36:58,798 --> 01:37:01,342
Stop. Stop, stop.
He says he misses you.

1788
01:37:01,343 --> 01:37:03,260
Aww, tell him I love him.

1789
01:37:03,261 --> 01:37:05,888
- Dad got me a knife.
- He says, "I love you."

1790
01:37:05,889 --> 01:37:08,432
- What?
- "I love you!"

1791
01:37:08,433 --> 01:37:10,757
I love you too!

1792
01:37:13,771 --> 01:37:17,472
Tell... tell him,
"I love you too." OK?

1793
01:37:18,735 --> 01:37:20,810
'Bye.

1794
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:24,614
Alright, 70!

1795
01:37:24,615 --> 01:37:31,037
<i>Every day
and nothing seem to change</i>

1796
01:37:31,038 --> 01:37:35,834
<i>Everywhere I go,
I keep seeing the same old thing</i>

1797
01:37:35,835 --> 01:37:38,278
<i>And I</i>

1798
01:37:40,965 --> 01:37:43,325
<i>I can't take it no more...</i>

1799
01:37:45,177 --> 01:37:47,834
- Let's take a selfie.
- A selfie?

1800
01:37:48,597 --> 01:37:51,254
Wait, let me do it with
the flash. Hold on.

1801
01:37:54,478 --> 01:37:57,135
Oh, look at that.
Email that to me, alright?

1802
01:37:57,648 --> 01:37:59,190
OK.

1803
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:00,775
Mind if I post this?

1804
01:38:00,776 --> 01:38:04,028
- What is that, another Vine?
- No, it's 'One Second Every Day' video.

1805
01:38:04,029 --> 01:38:05,571
Remember?

1806
01:38:05,572 --> 01:38:08,908
- It's the trip all cut together?
- Oh, the little cuts of the thing?

1807
01:38:08,909 --> 01:38:10,618
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, just email it to me.

1808
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:12,661
I'm sure it's fine.

1809
01:38:12,662 --> 01:38:16,582
Listen, I, uh... I want to
talk to you about something.

1810
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:18,542
Yeah?

1811
01:38:18,543 --> 01:38:22,296
I've had a really good time with
you these last couple of weeks.

1812
01:38:22,297 --> 01:38:24,048
Me too.

1813
01:38:24,049 --> 01:38:26,124
And...

1814
01:38:26,635 --> 01:38:28,912
you've become a really good cook.

1815
01:38:29,429 --> 01:38:30,971
- Thanks, Dad.
- Not just for a kid.

1816
01:38:30,972 --> 01:38:33,223
I mean, you're really good.
You work really hard.

1817
01:38:33,224 --> 01:38:35,225
It's a big deal.

1818
01:38:35,226 --> 01:38:39,896
But we're gonna be home soon,
and we're gonna get back to our lives,

1819
01:38:39,898 --> 01:38:41,815
and I'm gonna be really
busy with the truck

1820
01:38:41,816 --> 01:38:44,026
and you're gonna be
really busy with school.

1821
01:38:44,027 --> 01:38:46,027
But I can still work
on the truck, right?

1822
01:38:46,029 --> 01:38:47,696
You said I was a good cook.

1823
01:38:47,697 --> 01:38:49,447
I'm... I'm sorry, Percy.

1824
01:38:49,449 --> 01:38:51,366
I... I just don't want
you to be disappointed

1825
01:38:51,367 --> 01:38:53,451
when things go back to
the way that they were.

1826
01:38:53,452 --> 01:38:55,979
I don't want it to go back to that.

1827
01:38:56,497 --> 01:38:58,623
I could work after
school and on weekends.

1828
01:38:58,624 --> 01:39:00,542
I just want to be
honest with you, OK?

1829
01:39:00,543 --> 01:39:04,254
I feel like I've let you down so much,
and I didn't want to blindside you,

1830
01:39:04,255 --> 01:39:08,508
but the summer's gonna end and we're
not gonna be doing this anymore.

1831
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:10,093
OK?

1832
01:39:10,094 --> 01:39:12,501
OK.

1833
01:39:13,305 --> 01:39:16,307
But we had a lot of fun, and
nobody could take away from us

1834
01:39:16,308 --> 01:39:18,434
what we experienced
together, right?

1835
01:39:18,435 --> 01:39:21,092
And I feel like I
really got to know you.

1836
01:39:23,857 --> 01:39:26,929
Alright. Let's watch the music.

1837
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:34,521
<i>Well, if things don't
change around here</i>

1838
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:38,237
<i>There ain't no use
in me hanging right on</i>

1839
01:39:38,747 --> 01:39:40,822
<i>Hang around</i>

1840
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:44,442
<i>But I'll be ready now</i>

1841
01:39:45,921 --> 01:39:50,119
<i>I'll be ready when
my train pulls up</i>

1842
01:39:53,511 --> 01:39:56,536
<i>Well, I'll be ready now
Yeah</i>

1843
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:00,840
<i>I'll be ready when
my train pulls in</i>

1844
01:40:04,522 --> 01:40:07,691
<i>I know my time ain't
long around...</i>

1845
01:40:07,692 --> 01:40:10,633
Alright, pal. Here we are.

1846
01:40:17,952 --> 01:40:19,995
- Be nice to be home.
- Yep.

1847
01:40:19,996 --> 01:40:24,457
See your turtle, see your
mommy, back to your room.

1848
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:27,032
I'm really gonna miss you.

1849
01:40:31,715 --> 01:40:33,383
I'm gonna miss you too.

1850
01:40:33,384 --> 01:40:35,301
OK, but you'll stay
with me in two weeks.

1851
01:40:35,302 --> 01:40:36,636
- OK?
- Yeah.

1852
01:40:36,637 --> 01:40:38,638
- Whole weekend.
- Did you post the video yet?

1853
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,140
- I didn't look at it yet. Sorry.
- Don't forget.

1854
01:40:41,141 --> 01:40:42,683
- I won't.
- I'll resend it.

1855
01:40:42,684 --> 01:40:44,759
OK.

1856
01:40:50,234 --> 01:40:52,193
Come on. Mommy misses you.

1857
01:40:52,194 --> 01:40:54,352
Go. Go to Mommy.

1858
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:02,235
Mwah!

1859
01:41:09,502 --> 01:41:11,780
'Bye.

1860
01:41:33,067 --> 01:41:34,734
Oh, shit.

1861
01:42:04,598 --> 01:42:06,432
<i>- Wait a second.
- Gonna make...</i>

1862
01:42:06,433 --> 01:42:08,434
- Right, Dad?
- See you next week.

1863
01:42:08,435 --> 01:42:10,436
- Put that thing away.
- So I'm the nanny?

1864
01:42:10,437 --> 01:42:13,213
Here we go.

1865
01:42:15,442 --> 01:42:17,968
Hi.

1866
01:42:19,446 --> 01:42:22,019
- Look out.
- Oh!

1867
01:42:23,492 --> 01:42:25,492
- Empingao.
- Yeah!

1868
01:42:29,497 --> 01:42:31,498
- Park over there.
- Miami!

1869
01:42:36,504 --> 01:42:38,046
Come on, get in.

1870
01:42:38,047 --> 01:42:40,465
Arroz con pollo.

1871
01:42:40,466 --> 01:42:42,957
I think I missed the exit.

1872
01:42:43,469 --> 01:42:45,996
Beignets.

1873
01:43:23,008 --> 01:43:24,801
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

1874
01:43:24,802 --> 01:43:27,011
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1875
01:43:27,012 --> 01:43:29,013
What's up?

1876
01:43:29,014 --> 01:43:32,350
Listen, I was... I was thinking,
about what we were talking about.

1877
01:43:32,351 --> 01:43:33,893
Yeah?

1878
01:43:33,894 --> 01:43:36,645
And it's gotta be OK with Mom.
Let me just say that first.

1879
01:43:36,647 --> 01:43:38,758
What are you talking about?

1880
01:43:40,317 --> 01:43:42,843
I could really use your
help on the truck.

1881
01:43:46,114 --> 01:43:47,823
You there?

1882
01:43:47,824 --> 01:43:49,366
Yeah.

1883
01:43:49,367 --> 01:43:51,285
And it's only for the
weekends and after school

1884
01:43:51,286 --> 01:43:52,828
after you're done
with your homework,

1885
01:43:52,829 --> 01:43:54,496
and the money goes into
your college fund.

1886
01:43:54,497 --> 01:43:56,081
OK. Does that sound good?

1887
01:43:56,082 --> 01:43:58,125
That sounds pretty good.

1888
01:43:58,126 --> 01:44:01,461
Mom! Dad wants me to
cook on his truck!

1889
01:44:01,462 --> 01:44:03,630
No, really! He's on the phone.

1890
01:44:03,631 --> 01:44:07,009
Mom wants to talk to you.
I think it's yes. Hang on.

1891
01:44:36,664 --> 01:44:38,414
Order 16. 16.

1892
01:44:38,415 --> 01:44:40,942
- 16. 16, here.
- Thank you.

1893
01:44:42,127 --> 01:44:44,670
- 15.
- Order up. Order up. Next!

1894
01:44:44,671 --> 01:44:47,006
Mole, two Cubanos,

1895
01:44:47,007 --> 01:44:48,674
and order 21, slider.

1896
01:44:48,675 --> 01:44:50,218
- Thank you.
- 21? Thank you.

1897
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:52,470
- There you go. I got yours coming.
- Perfect. 15.

1898
01:44:52,471 --> 01:44:54,878
- Yes.
- OK. Thank you.

1899
01:44:56,516 --> 01:44:58,267
There's no food for you here.

1900
01:44:58,268 --> 01:45:00,603
Could I speak to the chef
for just a second, please?

1901
01:45:00,604 --> 01:45:02,679
The hell you will.

1902
01:45:04,483 --> 01:45:06,025
Can I talk to you?

1903
01:45:09,529 --> 01:45:12,138
Next! Next!

1904
01:45:17,746 --> 01:45:19,329
What exactly are you doing here?

1905
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:21,415
I'm, uh... eating the food.
I'm eating your food.

1906
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:23,500
I thought my food was
needy and cloying.

1907
01:45:23,501 --> 01:45:25,877
Well, I didn't think
you'd want to serve me,

1908
01:45:25,879 --> 01:45:28,380
so I sent somebody
else to pick it up.

1909
01:45:28,381 --> 01:45:32,175
What happened between us,
that really knocked me for a loop.

1910
01:45:32,176 --> 01:45:36,471
I mean, you robbed me of my pride
and my career and my dignity.

1911
01:45:36,472 --> 01:45:39,558
And I know people like you don't
usually care about that kind of thing.

1912
01:45:39,559 --> 01:45:41,101
That's not necessarily true.

1913
01:45:41,102 --> 01:45:43,603
But you should know,
it hurts people like me.

1914
01:45:43,604 --> 01:45:47,273
- 'Cause we're really trying.
- You started a flame war with me.

1915
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:49,609
Are you kidding me? I buy
ink by the barrel, buddy.

1916
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:51,569
What are you doing
picking a fight with me?

1917
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:53,321
I wouldn't challenge
you to a cook-off.

1918
01:45:53,322 --> 01:45:55,240
I thought I was sending
you a private message.

1919
01:45:55,241 --> 01:45:57,951
I didn't know that.
I thought we were having fun.

1920
01:45:57,952 --> 01:46:01,412
It was theatre. By the way,
what the fuck were you cooking?

1921
01:46:01,413 --> 01:46:04,332
You totally shat the bed, buddy.
How could I back that?

1922
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:07,084
You were one of my early boys.

1923
01:46:07,086 --> 01:46:08,920
I had no control over the menu.

1924
01:46:08,921 --> 01:46:12,548
Whatever the case, OK? You seem
to be cooking for yourself again.

1925
01:46:12,549 --> 01:46:15,009
Because this shit is sensational.

1926
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:17,011
I mean, really, really good.

1927
01:46:17,012 --> 01:46:18,554
Thank you.

1928
01:46:18,555 --> 01:46:20,306
I'm not gonna write about it.

1929
01:46:20,307 --> 01:46:22,391
Yeah. I understand.

1930
01:46:22,392 --> 01:46:24,835
Because I'd like to back you.

1931
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,022
Excuse me?

1932
01:46:28,023 --> 01:46:29,565
I wanna bankroll you,

1933
01:46:29,566 --> 01:46:32,109
and I can't write about anything
I have a vested interest in.

1934
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:34,028
I'm not sure I get
what's going on here.

1935
01:46:34,029 --> 01:46:36,155
I sold my website for
a whole lot of money

1936
01:46:36,156 --> 01:46:38,699
and I've just put in a
bid on a place on Rose.

1937
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:42,119
It's zoned, it's permitted. You could
build it out however you like.

1938
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,787
And you can cook whatever you like.

1939
01:46:43,788 --> 01:46:45,539
Take your time, think about it.

1940
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:47,624
I wouldn't blame you for
having a few trust issues,

1941
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:49,167
but I just thought that, you know,

1942
01:46:49,168 --> 01:46:51,503
you and me burying the hatchet
might be a good story.

1943
01:46:51,504 --> 01:46:53,338
Reservations out the door.

1944
01:46:53,339 --> 01:46:56,758
More importantly, you know, you
just cook your ass off in there.

1945
01:46:56,759 --> 01:46:59,594
In the meantime, you just
tweet me wherever you are

1946
01:46:59,595 --> 01:47:01,137
and I'll come running.

1947
01:47:01,138 --> 01:47:03,747
'Cause this shit's good. Alright?

1948
01:47:05,059 --> 01:47:06,601
Delicious!

1949
01:47:06,602 --> 01:47:08,677
Delicioso.

1950
01:47:09,313 --> 01:47:11,272
Mucho goodo.

1951
01:47:11,273 --> 01:47:12,774
- Hey, jefe.
- Yeah?

1952
01:47:12,775 --> 01:47:15,068
That was a lot of talking
and you not punching him.

1953
01:47:15,069 --> 01:47:17,144
So, what'd that asshole say, huh?

1954
01:47:17,655 --> 01:47:20,239
I think that asshole might
be our new partner.

1955
01:47:55,442 --> 01:47:57,517
Go, go, go, go

1956
01:52:26,707 --> 01:52:28,416
Thank you!

1957
01:52:28,417 --> 01:52:30,585
A mark. B mark.

1958
01:52:30,586 --> 01:52:32,671
Looks good. It looks good already.

1959
01:52:32,672 --> 01:52:35,661
The heat is right on.

1960
01:52:36,342 --> 01:52:38,259
- That's olive oil?
- Yeah.

1961
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:40,053
What are you grabbing over there?

1962
01:52:40,054 --> 01:52:42,129
You're grabbing all your cheese.

1963
01:52:43,516 --> 01:52:45,058
Yeah.

1964
01:52:45,059 --> 01:52:47,852
What are you doing there?
Spreading it around or finding...

1965
01:52:47,853 --> 01:52:49,854
- Spreading it around.
- What are you looking for there?

1966
01:52:49,855 --> 01:52:51,731
Heat. Heat.

1967
01:52:51,732 --> 01:52:53,608
So it doesn't burn?

1968
01:52:53,609 --> 01:52:57,028
- Where's the hottest spot?
- Right here is the hot spot.

1969
01:52:57,029 --> 01:53:02,283
So you're controlling it all the time.
You're always controlling.

1970
01:53:02,284 --> 01:53:04,076
And you're looking, you're looking.

1971
01:53:04,077 --> 01:53:08,414
As soon as you get your good colour...
This is now where you start it.

1972
01:53:08,415 --> 01:53:12,400
You start to really build
the sandwich itself.

1973
01:53:12,919 --> 01:53:15,280
A light scrape.

1974
01:53:15,797 --> 01:53:20,384
So you can see, the whole
sandwich starts to evolve.

1975
01:53:20,385 --> 01:53:22,553
And, see, the cheese is
starting to evolve too.

1976
01:53:22,554 --> 01:53:25,305
Yes, you can do it. There you go.

1977
01:53:25,306 --> 01:53:27,381
Getting in there.

1978
01:53:28,476 --> 01:53:30,185
You're almost...

1979
01:53:30,186 --> 01:53:31,853
Even now, as you get further, Jon,

1980
01:53:31,855 --> 01:53:33,730
you're getting in,
like, assertive now.

1981
01:53:33,731 --> 01:53:36,483
You're changing...
Even your grip's here.

1982
01:53:36,484 --> 01:53:38,360
- Mm-hm.
- Changing your positions.

1983
01:53:38,361 --> 01:53:40,237
You're moving around.

1984
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:43,198
But you're not too
busy with it. You're...

1985
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:46,034
You're precise, but then
sometimes you step back.

1986
01:53:46,035 --> 01:53:48,453
- Nothing else exists except this.
- Right.

1987
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:52,290
This is the only thing that
exists in this world right now.

1988
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:54,626
And if you fuck this up,
everything sucks in the world.
