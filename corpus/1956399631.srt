00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,530
ANNOUNCEMENT [OVER
SPEAKER]: Sequence

2
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,050
will initiate in five minutes.

3
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,060
All personnel, clear
north metal area.

4
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,510
How we looking, Shannon?

5
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,080
Oh, we're good to go.

6
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,250
Kent still down there?

7
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,030
I'm here.

8
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,130
All right, let's see what God
has in store for us tonight.

9
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,670
What happened?

10
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,200
The sensors indicate
some kind of an explosion.

11
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,720
I've got it too.
Section 117, northeast quadrant.

12
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,160
There's a radiation leak.

13
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,560
Anything else?

14
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,950
I'm seeing some sort of
anomalous energy signature

15
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,780
at the point of impact.

16
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,010
You're sure we shouldn't be
calling Spencer about this?

17
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,360
No.

18
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
Not until I know what
we're dealing with.

19
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,100
The concern is dully noted.

20
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:33,110
You should be nearing 116.

21
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,030
Stop the car.

22
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,530
Feel it?

23
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,490
Uhuh.

24
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,880
The air, it's gusting.

25
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,410
What?

26
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,370
Shannon, are you getting this?

27
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,240
SHANNON MUIR: Trying.

28
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,690
Hauser, what is that?

29
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,560
I can't hear you.

30
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,950
You're breaking up.

31
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,990
SHANNON MUIR: Careful,
we don't know what--

32
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,820
What did she say?

33
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,870
Hauser, I'm losing you.

34
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,880
Kent, I need that beam.

35
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,360
I think I saw something.

36
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,590
Copy that.

37
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,590
Kent!

38
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,590
Kent!--

39
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,590
Oh my God!

40
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,120
Hauser, I'm loosing you.

41
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,600
Kent, William, I'm
loosing your signal.

42
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,080
Oh!

43
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,090
Ah!

44
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:58,910
My God!

45
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,440
I can't!

46
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,500
Go!

47
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,500
Go!

48
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,500
Go!

49
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,550
Come on!
Come on!

50
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,500
No!

51
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,420
No!

52
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,500
No!

53
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,980
Kent, what are you doing?

54
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,380
You're going the wrong way.

55
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,370
PILOT 1:

56
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,320
Niner-One reported visual.

57
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,310
REPORTER 1: I
don't know if you've

58
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,320
been feeling them at
home, but we certainly

59
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,840
have here at the studio.

60
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,710
A series of small
earthquakes that

61
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,020
has been shaking the ground
beneath our very feet

62
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,150
for the past few hours.

63
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,070
So far nothing to cause
too much alarm, but enough

64
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,020
to leave local scientists
scratching their

65
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,940
heads trying to--

66
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,550
REPORTER 2:
Ellen, in a few moments

67
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,990
we could be going to the
Geological Services Department

68
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,900
at the University of St. Louis,
where, hopefully, somebody

69
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,470
can offer us a better
explanation than anything

70
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,910
that we have to offer you now.

71
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,430
Eric, pick up the phone.

72
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,140
MAN 2: [OVER
SPEAKER] 219 at 5219.

73
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,620
We're down to reach
the perimeter.

74
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,580
Agent 12, we need you
to update your location.

75
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,260
REPORTER 1:
You know, nothing high.

76
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,390
We're talking like a 3.2, a 3.1.

77
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,570
--just above a 4.0
on the Richter scale.

78
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,830
What's causing some
concern isn't so much--

79
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,660
OK, OK.

80
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,190
I'm coming.

81
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,980
Oh, this better be important.

82
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,670
Dr. Eric Bryce.

83
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,890
Yes.

84
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,420
If you'll please
come with me, sir.

85
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,550
Come with you, where?

86
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,680
There's been an
accident at the lab.

87
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,040
I could use a fresh
pot of coffee, you guys.

88
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,700
How are were looking, Sergeant?

89
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,700
Current readings put us
at just under three hours

90
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,830
before this thing
is going to have

91
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,220
its way with the outer wall.

92
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,750
And length.

93
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,620
We're looking at a 10
minute evacuation window.

94
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,580
Max.

95
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,450
What's taking
Hendricks so long?

96
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,680
General, they're here.

97
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,550
Lieutenant.

98
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,050
I'm sorry.

99
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,320
Dr. Bryce, General Ryker.

100
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,620
I'm in command here.

101
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,930
Where is Hauser?

102
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,450
He's dead.

103
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,280
Follow me.

104
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,730
How is this possible?

105
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,810
I was hoping
you could tell me.

106
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,470
Now, you worked closely with
Dr. Hauser up until about six

107
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,340
months ago, is that correct?

108
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,390
Yes, we worked
together for 14 years.

109
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,430
And you're familiar
with his research?

110
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,520
Yes, but our work
was only theoretical.

111
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,570
We were years from doing
anything like this.

112
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,790
A consortium out of China
started showing results and--

113
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,700
We didn't want to
fall further behind,

114
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,190
so we decided to
accelerate the schedule.

115
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,620
Without consulting me first?

116
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,410
You were no longer a
part of the team, Eric.

117
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,230
We had no obligation to
consult you about anything.

118
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,800
All right, we don't
have time for this.

119
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,430
When did that start happening?

120
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,780
At 2:01 a.m.

121
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,000
The Navy detected an
abnormal electromagnetic pulse.

122
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,700
The GPS was linked
to the lab here.

123
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,570
We came on site, locked
down the facility.

124
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,180
We don't have much time.

125
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,790
We're looking at a countdown
of less than three hours,

126
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,840
and God knows what's
going to happen then.

127
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,840
Theoretical has become
a reality, Doctor.

128
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,150
Are you willing to try
and help me or not?

129
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,540
Yes.

130
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,200
The president, a few
of his top advisors,

131
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,810
and the director of
Homeland Security

132
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,510
have been made aware of what
we are dealing with here.

133
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,290
The president has
also authorized

134
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,730
me to explore all possible
containment options,

135
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,120
including nuclear action.

136
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,080
Who suggested nuclear action?

137
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,040
It's the strongest
response listed

138
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,650
in our contingency plans.

139
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,130
General, a black hole is not
an ordinary object that you

140
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,570
can drop a bomb on and destroy.

141
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,660
It's called a black hole
because its gravitational force

142
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,660
is so strong that not
even light can escape.

143
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm not completely
unprepared, right, Shannon?

144
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,410
I explained all this to you.

145
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,710
The bomb blast's energy
will be absorbed by the hole,

146
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,850
increasing its size.

147
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,810
More than likely, it will
kick it like a soccer ball.

148
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,240
And we won't know where
it's going to end up.

149
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,860
Maybe the middle of St. Louis,
killing thousands of people.

150
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,160
It might crack in
two or three or five,

151
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,820
each with its own
destructive growth potential.

152
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,820
Dropping the bomb
is only an option.

153
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,910
That's why I had
you called in here,

154
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,960
so you could start
giving me better options.

155
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,490
I suggest you get started.
- OK.

156
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,790
Well, I'm going to need to see
Hauser's files, all his data

157
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,790
over the last six months.

158
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,970
Whatever you need.

159
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,880
Yeah, I'm going
to need her to help.

160
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,160
We had concerns
you would become

161
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,810
unstable since the divorce, that
your ability to evaluate risk

162
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,030
properly had become compromised
because of the trouble

163
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,860
back home.

164
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,830
What were you thinking?

165
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,780
Staff was consulted
and we voted.

166
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,610
The jury agreed with
Hauser and we moved on.

167
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,960
Well, the least you could
have done was call me.

168
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,010
I wanted to.

169
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,100
I voted to keep you in the loop.

170
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,930
I was overruled.

171
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,540
All right, OK, so that's it.

172
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,970
So you take a vote, and then
you continue with research

173
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
that will threaten the planet.

174
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,020
I think they might be a
little more than friends.

175
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,940
Last night we were
just running tests,

176
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,420
the same tests that
we'd run over 10

177
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,210
times before without incident.

178
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,040
They were not the same.

179
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,300
Something was different.

180
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,780
I'm sorry that I didn't
call you before this morning,

181
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,520
but you just haven't
been the same

182
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,310
since you lost custody of Kay--

183
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,050
Kayley.

184
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,530
Kayley.

185
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,310
Oh, no.

186
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,320
Ryker jammed the signal.

187
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,150
What's wrong?

188
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,230
We have move back
to her parent's house.

189
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,370
Kayley is not five
miles from here.

190
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,460
Use the fax.

191
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,810
It runs on a different system.

192
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,340
Kayley, come on.
We're going to be late.

193
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,340
Hello?

194
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,770
Hello, Beth?

195
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,690
Eric.

196
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,170
Beth, listen.

197
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,260
Look, I thought I told
you we needed some space.

198
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,520
Listen to me, something's
gone wrong with the research.

199
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,740
You have to leave
town immediately.

200
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,130
What?

201
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,390
You're drinking again.

202
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,310
No.

203
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,570
Yes.

204
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,010
But-- Beth, our
daughter is in danger.

205
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,060
Look, you know these
calls don't work.

206
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,710
Kayley, come on.

207
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,410
Kayley's got a tennis lesson
that starts in five minutes.

208
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,410
I got to go.

209
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,190
Beth--

210
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,510
Oh, come on.

211
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,340
Aren't you going to get that?

212
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,260
Let it ring.

213
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,530
What did she say?

214
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,790
She going to leave?

215
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,230
No.

216
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,880
Why not?

217
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,400
Because she doesn't
believe what I say anymore.

218
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,930
Did you find anything?

219
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm running a
disk check to see

220
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,850
if there's anything
different here than what's

221
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,410
posted on the server.

222
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,760
OK.

223
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,110
I'm going to go through last
night's results backwards.

224
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,550
We missed something.

225
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,080
Come on.

226
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,090
Show yourself to me.

227
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,310
Well, Commander, we all find
God in the foxhole, right?

228
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,610
Yes, sir.

229
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,310
Are those numbers
still accurate?

230
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,230
Yes, sir.

231
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,150
Hold on, everybody.

232
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,630
Hold on.

233
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,550
What's happening, Sergeant?

234
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,160
I don't know.

235
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,500
We've got size indicators
pushing up through the roof.

236
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,290
15% in the last 30 seconds.

237
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,690
We're losing time rapidly.

238
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,000
What do you think, Doc?

239
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,350
Let me look at this.

240
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,870
The growth rate seems to be
plateauing, still elevated,

241
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,440
but it stopped accelerating.

242
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,750
Up 26% in less than a minute.

243
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,360
You sure?

244
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,660
Secondary indicators confirm.

245
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,970
Well, the growth
rate should be

246
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,230
determined by the
hole's environment,

247
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,710
the density of its surroundings.

248
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,280
Well, some way or
another, Doctor, this hole's

249
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,460
growing faster
than it was before.

250
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,280
How is this possible?

251
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,110
Look, if it spikes
again, you let me know.

252
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,550
I'm seeing a serious
voltage drop in the main power

253
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,990
line feeding this facility.

254
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,900
Which line?

255
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,770
B7.

256
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,380
B7, B7.

257
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,470
My God, that's
close to this room.

258
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,650
Yes.

259
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,170
But it can't be
accessed directly.

260
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,340
It has to be accessed
through this tunnel here.

261
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,780
Yeah, but if we
lose that line,

262
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,870
we could lose all of the
monitoring equipment.

263
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,740
Corporal Hendricks, yeah, I got
a problem on line, power line--

264
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,660
B7.

265
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,790
--B7.
Check it out.

266
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,090
Take Private James with you.

267
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,360
I need that line
stable again A-S-A-P.

268
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,270
HENDRICKS: On my way.

269
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,690
You all right?

270
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,480
Yeah.

271
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,650
Just never been done
in something like this.

272
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,710
Anything?

273
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,410
This data doesn't make sense.

274
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,150
You're right, you
were performing

275
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:26,240
the same series of tests, same
conditions, same parameters.

276
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,630
I told you.

277
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,420
Yes, but-- but there
is some variable,

278
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,380
something that we're missing.

279
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,730
Why don't you pull up the
environmental readings

280
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,990
from the tunnel immediately
following the accident.

281
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,210
There-- there must be
some clue somewhere.

282
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,360
That's strange.

283
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,320
Must be the
plate in your head.

284
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,670
Or the magnet in my crotch.

285
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,680
Hey, you hear that?

286
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,420
This way.

287
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,510
General, the hole's
growth rate is pulling back.

288
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,040
Thank you, Lieutenant.

289
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,480
And power seems to be
coming back on that line.

290
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,130
You were right.

291
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,350
It wasn't just the hole
that was registering,

292
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,790
they were increased
radiation levels

293
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:46,970
also in section 116, 115, 114.

294
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,980
Almost like something was
moving away from the hole.

295
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,290
GENERAL RYKER: Dr.
Bryce, Shannon.

296
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,770
What is it?

297
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,420
Been another change
in the hole's growth.

298
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,640
Oh, it's going up again?

299
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,030
No, it slowed down.

300
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,510
And the change seems
to be tied to some sort

301
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,600
of power fluctuation we're
seeing on the main line

302
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
for the facility.

303
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,860
Power fluctuation?

304
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,950
Yeah, I sent a
team to investigate.

305
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,950
What's wrong?

306
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,570
I think those radiation
readings aren't from the hole,

307
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,960
but from something that
came out of the hole.

308
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,880
That's impossible, Eric.

309
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,970
Based on what
we think we know.

310
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,370
Smell that?

311
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,200
What the?

312
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,600
Looks like something
tore into that thing.

313
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,910
This is Hendricks.

314
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,090
Can you read me?

315
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,480
Get out of there.

316
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,050
In the utility tunnel,
down the set of stairs.

317
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,360
Here.

318
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,050
General, you have
to get them out now.

319
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,320
Hendricks, if you
can hear me, you've

320
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,800
got to get out of there now.

321
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,800
Can you hear me?

322
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,930
Get out of there A-S-A-P.

323
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,640
We've got growth again.

324
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,520
What in God's
name was that thing?

325
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,130
I think we found our catalyst.

326
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,320
I read you.

327
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,500
Dr. Shannon, come with me.

328
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,760
We've got a problem outside.

329
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,590
Sergeant, stay on the monitor.

330
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,130
I want two units in the air
right now tracking this thing.

331
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,560
I'm going to need to
follow on the ground.

332
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,780
What about the situation
right here, Doctor?

333
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,090
Whatever that
thing is, somehow it

334
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,740
came out of a black hole.

335
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,270
Well, how does that help it?

336
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,010
Well, every time the
thing takes in energy,

337
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,270
the hole grows.

338
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,140
The two are connected.

339
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,840
But they're separated.

340
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,540
Well, we've seen particles
connected over long distances

341
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,060
on the quantum level.

342
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,190
Have you ever seen anything
on this scale, Doctor?

343
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,150
General, look, I think
that the solution to the hole

344
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,020
is there.

345
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,200
I need to monitor it.

346
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,460
Get me a car.

347
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,900
I'll get some equipment.

348
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,810
If our position
is compromised we're

349
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,420
going to relocate
to a new command

350
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,380
center west of downtown.

351
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,390
Use this to stay
in contact with me.

352
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Channel three.

353
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,660
What do you got there, Shannon?

354
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,400
It's a micro-magnetic
wave analyzer.

355
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,530
It'll help us determine
the entities property.

356
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,920
All right.

357
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,880
The signal is scrambled,
so you can talk freely.

358
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,270
Yes, General.

359
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,490
You might want to worry
less about security

360
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,880
and more about
evacuating the city.

361
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,320
I will when the
time's right, Doctor.

362
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,500
Sergeant Bennett, how are
we looking on the power?

363
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,120
REPORTER 3:
Leading the news now

364
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,940
at the top of the
hour, yet another quake

365
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,990
shaking the greater
St. Louis area.

366
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,380
This most recent--

367
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,300
Who are you calling?

368
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,950
Kayley.

369
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,870
They probably already left.

370
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,480
- I hope so.
- Eric, there.

371
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,830
REPORTER 4: [OVER
RADIO] Yes, I do.

372
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,570
We're just now getting
word that scientists

373
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,480
have identified a
single epicenter

374
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,360
for all the moving quakes--

375
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,620
It's feeding off
the power lines.

376
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,530
It's following the
current upstream.

377
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,670
If we're going to get anything
meaningful from these readings,

378
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,930
we've got to get closer.

379
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,580
Hold on.

380
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,410
OK.

381
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,160
REPORTER 5: The
news has been shaking

382
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
and the experts don't know why.

383
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,680
Seismologist at the Geological--

384
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,680
--Services Department
at the University of St.

385
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,640
Louis are still not sure
what's causing these temblors,

386
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,860
but one thing is certain--

387
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,470
I'll be in my room, mom.

388
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,040
Why don't you get
started on that homework?

389
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,690
REPORTER 5: --are
pinpointing the epicenter

390
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,480
of the quakes here in
the Midwestern Quantum

391
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,220
Research Laboratory, known
here locally as the NQRL.

392
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,000
So far--

393
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,490
How are we doing, people?

394
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,400
We're losing time.

395
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,580
Are we back online yet?

396
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,880
We're up.

397
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,450
Someone could find
me a cup of coffee.

398
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,800
I'll be eternally grateful.

399
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,980
REPORTER 6:
We're going now live--

400
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,810
Ryker, are you seeing this?

401
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,330
You're telling us
that you're tracking

402
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,420
some sort of an electrical
phenomenon in the area

403
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,330
close to the--

404
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,120
I'm here, Doctor.

405
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,030
I've got a ringside seat.

406
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,910
--Video feed to you guys now,
but basically what we have from

407
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,740
here is some kind of
concentrated electrical forms,

408
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,740
like the shiny ball of
electricity that seems to be

409
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,090
following the power lines.

410
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,480
REPORTER 7:
How long have you been

411
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,790
following this thing, Russ?

412
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,310
RUSS MARTIN: Just
over 10 minutes now.

413
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,180
And I first picked it up
from about two miles out,

414
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,440
so that should give
you an idea of--

415
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,750
I'm General Ryker,
Director Hayes--

416
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,620
- Here's your coffee, sir.
- Bless you, soldier.

417
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,580
Oh my--

418
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,150
Oh, whoa.

419
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,020
What is that?

420
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,600
So now you're telling me
we're dealing with a black hole

421
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,000
and a monster?

422
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,780
Yes, sir.

423
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,090
I know it sounds crazy, but Dr.
Bryce is convinced that the two

424
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,660
are somehow connected.

425
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,790
That this thing might be
the key to closing the hole.

426
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,490
And you think he's right?

427
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,930
At this point, I think
it's wise to take his advice.

428
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,100
We don't have any other choice.

429
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,800
I mean, we're
dealing with things

430
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,800
outside our base of knowledge,
outside my base of knowledge

431
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,720
anyway.

432
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,420
HAYES: And your situation there?

433
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,160
GENERAL RYKER: We're a little
over an hour until that hole

434
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,860
cracks the accelerator wall.

435
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,340
Given that fact and the
appearance of the creature,

436
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,650
I think the times come to
start thinking evacuation, sir.

437
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,650
Immediately.

438
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll handle the media.

439
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,300
You stay focused there.

440
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,220
Yes, sir.

441
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,090
I understand.

442
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,260
Dr. Bryce, are you there?

443
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,620
Are you there?

444
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,050
I'm here.

445
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,880
GENERAL RYKER: Have you
located our creature?

446
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,320
Yeah.

447
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,450
GENERAL RYKER: Now, your
streets are about to get

448
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,710
a little more crowded.

449
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,630
Homeland Security
has just issued

450
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,330
an official evacuation warning.

451
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,330
Good.

452
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,940
How much time do we have?

453
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,720
We've got just under
40 minutes until breach.

454
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,380
ERIC BRYCE: Start packing up
all your nonessential equipment.

455
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,600
If this thing finds its way to
a high voltage power source,

456
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,600
I think your clock is going
to evaporate in seconds.

457
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm going to have to
pull the helicopters in,

458
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,870
so you're on your own out there.

459
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,610
ERIC BRYCE: That's fine.

460
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,260
Sergeant Bennett,
before you leave,

461
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,220
make sure you upload all the
data of the systems there.

462
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,830
On it now.

463
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
REPORTER 8: Immediate
evacuation of St. Louis

464
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,660
and all surrounding areas.

465
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,190
I repeat, the immediate and full
evacuation of St. Louis and all

466
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,970
surrounding areas.

467
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
No further details
at this point,

468
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,150
other than one
inside source saying

469
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,460
that the evacuation
is not directly

470
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,680
related to a terrorist threat.

471
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,030
Am I getting this right, Ben?

472
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,120
I got to get in here.

473
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,860
You don't look so good.

474
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,210
Why don't you take care of it?

475
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,550
REPORTER 9:
But those who have,

476
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,690
have said that this
is all probably

477
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,510
having something to do with
the series of earthquakes--

478
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Hey, now, listen, when
those copters come in,

479
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,690
I want men down
there ready to load.

480
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,710
REPORTER 8:
Said the president

481
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,200
and his aides remain
tight-lipped at this point.

482
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,370
What I can tell you is that
the evacuation procedures are

483
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,720
currently being--
- Kayley.

484
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,900
REPORTER 8:
--by the Department

485
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,160
of Homeland Security.
- Kayley.

486
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,250
- Get your things quickly.

487
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,510
We need to go.
- Come on, mom.

488
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,550
I already did tennis.

489
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,290
What's the big deal, anyway?

490
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,730
REPORTER 8: Hearing our
numbers ranging between 2,000

491
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,470
and 3,000, which I
know may sound high,

492
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,910
but actually it's not
enough to control--

493
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,740
MAN 4: Attention
to all citizens.

494
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,440
Evacuate immediately.

495
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,870
What's going on?

496
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,220
I don't know,
but we need to go.

497
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,530
REPORTER 9:
Officials have just

498
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,620
ordered the complete evacua--

499
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,720
Here.

500
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,980
Call your father.

501
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,850
Seriously?

502
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,980
Seriously.

503
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,330
It says that all
circuits are busy.

504
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,160
Keep trying.

505
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,650
Speculation still
running rampant,

506
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,910
but one thing is clear,
movement out of the city

507
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,130
has all but ground to a halt.
All highways and major surface

508
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,310
streets are now gridlocked
with few stretches

509
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,050
breaking five miles an hour.

510
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,870
Government officials are
trying to reroute traffic,

511
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,790
but those attempts, so far,
meeting with little success.

512
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,320
This thing is
blazing white hot.

513
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,150
You can almost see
the radiation trails.

514
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,850
It's almost like it's more
energy than it is matter.

515
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,070
Ryker, you there?

516
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,590
GENERAL RYKER: Yes.

517
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,380
How much longer until
you finish that uplink?

518
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,550
I need more time, sir.

519
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,510
How much?

520
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,420
I don't know.

521
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,340
Just a few minutes.

522
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,510
OK, listen, let me know
as soon as it's done.

523
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,780
I want to check some
of those numbers

524
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,000
against the power recorders.

525
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,740
All set?

526
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,700
Mhm.

527
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,520
OK.

528
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,140
ERIC BRYCE: Oh my God.

529
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,400
SHANNON MUIR: If that
things electrical intake

530
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,880
really is connected
to the hole's growth.

531
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,840
ERIC BRYCE: Ryker.

532
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,660
Ryker.

533
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,500
GENERAL RYKER: What is it?

534
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,020
ERIC BRYCE: You've
got to evacuate.

535
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,590
Ryker, get out of there now.

536
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,630
You're breaking up on me.

537
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,070
ERIC BRYCE: Listen,
thing's about to tap main grid.

538
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,980
Did you get that?

539
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,120
No, sir.

540
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,120
You're breaking up on me.

541
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,990
Try it again.

542
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,640
Get out of there now!

543
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,600
Doctor.

544
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,430
Doctor.

545
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,700
Wait, there's somebody there!

546
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,540
Ryker, get out of there now!

547
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,630
The entity's about to
tap into the main grid.

548
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:13,280
You've got to get
out of there now!

549
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,680
Hold on, everybody.

550
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:36,660
Code flame spiking
at 10%, 20%, 50%.

551
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,180
Listen up, everybody.

552
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,140
We are evacuating now.

553
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,140
Leave remaining
equipment behind.

554
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,880
That is an order.

555
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,750
Doctor, I am moving the command
center to the Soldiers Memorial

556
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,020
Museum.

557
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,450
We'll get there
as soon as we can.

558
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,150
Power down as soon
as you finish here.

559
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,150
Yes, sir.

560
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,150
OK, we have to figure
out some way to get

561
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,550
that thing off the transformer.

562
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,160
We have to buy Ryker
enough time to evacuate.

563
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,110
But how?

564
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,090
It's reacting to the siren.

565
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,870
It also reacted to
the alarm at the lab.

566
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,090
Maybe it hears sounds
or feels the vibrations.

567
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,190
I think you're right, but why?

568
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,410
Well, space is a vacuum.

569
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,190
It's pretty much silent.

570
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,370
Maybe it's from some far reach
of the universe that's not used

571
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,940
to these kind of frequencies.

572
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,850
I've got an idea.

573
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,200
- OK.

574
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,200
That's it.

575
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,720
Upload's complete.

576
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,770
Where's Tolland?

577
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,810
I haven't seen him in a while.

578
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,990
He didn't look so good.

579
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,900
No, no, no.

580
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,950
Sergeant, out of here.

581
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,950
I'll take of this.

582
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,730
Go on.

583
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,610
Tolland.

584
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,530
MAN 5: All
personnel must evacuate--

585
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,360
BENNETT: Tolland.

586
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,190
Tolland.

587
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,150
MAN 5:
All personnel

588
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,840
must evacuate immediately.

589
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,850
All personnel must
evacuate immediately.

590
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,900
All personnel must
evacuate immediately.

591
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,110
Not your typical experiment.

592
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,890
You ready?

593
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,210
Definitely got his attention.

594
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,690
Get down!

595
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,610
You OK?

596
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,570
Yeah.

597
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,220
That'll give Ryker time
to get out of the lab.

598
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,010
Here you go.

599
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,920
Stay still.

600
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,280
Now what?

601
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,070
I'll call the general.

602
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,160
I think I know how to
get rid of the hole.

603
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,030
General Ryker.

604
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,680
General Ryker.

605
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,510
Come in.

606
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,120
General Ryker.

607
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:04,990
Anyone.

608
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,520
Whatever it did to
the truck, I think

609
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,520
it did to this signal boost.

610
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,530
How about checking the entity?

611
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,700
I'm not worried
about that now.

612
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,490
Look.

613
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,970
Let's go back upstairs
to our chopper pilot

614
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,060
reporter, Russ Martin.

615
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,280
Russ, what do you see?

616
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,800
I am over the
East St. Louis power

617
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,500
substation, where this
thing is on the move again.

618
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,280
It's leaving by way
of a major trunkline

619
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,940
that leads out of the facility.

620
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,940
And from what I can
tell, it appears

621
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,900
to be heading towards
the Central Street power

622
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,380
station, which is the main--

623
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,290
Move it, man.

624
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,200
Come on.

625
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,250
Faster.

626
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,160
Hustle, man.

627
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,690
Hustle.

628
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,730
Sergeant Bennett, what's
taking you so long?

629
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,080
I can't find him.

630
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,350
I can't find Tolland.

631
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,170
Tolland.

632
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,700
MAN 6: Bravo team, get
the truck loaded now.

633
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,010
Get out of there
immediately, Sergeant.

634
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,180
We got to go, man.

635
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,320
The ground's beginning to give.

636
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,530
BENNETT: Give me
two more minutes.

637
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,100
Negative.

638
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,280
That's an order, Sergeant.

639
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,020
If I'm not back
in five, lift off.

640
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,850
Yes, sir.

641
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,340
BENNETT: Tolland!

642
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,300
What are you doing?

643
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,390
I'm going to
smash that window.

644
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,830
We're taking the truck.

645
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,740
Wait, whoa, whoa.

646
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,520
Hold on.

647
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,310
Simple works.

648
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:56,760
Eric.

649
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,690
Tolland!

650
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,740
To-- Oh my God.

651
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,740
Are you OK?

652
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,180
Oh, I'm fine.

653
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,570
- We have to get out of here.
- OK.

654
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,750
Come on.

655
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,440
We have to get out
of the building.

656
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,310
Let's go.

657
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,230
We're ready.

658
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,670
This way.

659
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,890
Come on.
Come on.

660
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,930
Let's go.

661
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,890
We've got to get out of here.

662
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,760
Now!

663
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,760
Sergeant!

664
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,730
Sergeant!

665
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,640
Sergeant Bennett!

666
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,000
Sergeant Bennett!

667
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,580
We're now going back live to
Russ Martin in the helicopter,

668
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,360
where all morning long
he's been tracking

669
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,760
that electrical entity.

670
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,370
That's right, Bat.

671
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,930
We are just inside the
grounds now at the main power

672
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,850
substation, and it seems
to be-- no, it's heading

673
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,890
for the main transformer.

674
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Russ, are you all right?

675
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,250
RUSS MARTIN: OK.

676
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,420
We have got sparks
20, 30 feet high here.

677
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,080
I don't know what this
looks like on your screens,

678
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,300
but I tell you, from up here--

679
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,390
Move it.

680
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,390
Go, Lieutenant.

681
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,220
Go.

682
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,950
That must have been it.

683
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,950
The hole must have
cracked the outer wall.

684
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,780
We have to reach Ryker.

685
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,610
All circuits are busy.

686
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,000
Try again.

687
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,660
Look, with the nuclear
option still in play,

688
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,350
I don't want to be out of
contact with him for too long.

689
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,100
RUSS MARTIN: The black
energy passing has literally

690
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,880
tortured the grounds of NQRL.

691
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,400
REPORTER 9: Russ, are you
saying that the NQRL is gone?

692
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,880
RUSS MARTIN: From what
I can see, unless it's

693
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,020
underneath this thing.

694
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,360
Wait, hold on a second.

695
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,540
OK, this thing appears
to be growing, and--

696
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,980
what am I looking at?

697
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,810
It's pulling things in
from the right and left.

698
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:55,850
REPORTER 9: Pulling things in?

699
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,680
Russ, that doesn't make sense.

700
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,380
Yeah, that's right.

701
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,640
If I didn't know better, I
would say, what I'm looking at

702
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,510
appears to be some
kind of black hole.

703
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,610
What's happened to
the doctor and Shannon.

704
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,390
We lost contact with
them a few miles away

705
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,650
from our substation.

706
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,530
There was a large explosion.

707
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,220
Could you see if
they were all right?

708
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,530
There was no way to tell, sir.

709
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,370
MAN 7: All right,
ladies, let's move.

710
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,720
Everybody has their orders.

711
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,240
I don't want to see
anybody standing around.

712
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,560
Sir, Ryker.

713
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,520
Major Samson.

714
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,300
I'll take you to command.

715
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,870
Did you manage to download all
the data out of that facility

716
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,300
yet?
- Yes, sir.

717
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,780
But the analysis has
been put on hold.

718
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,610
By who?

719
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,490
It's about time you
joined us, General.

720
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,360
For a second there I thought
maybe you'd been sucked in,

721
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,930
become part of our problem.

722
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,280
Nice to see you off your
horse for a change, General.

723
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,840
Yeah, I think I can
only let the second string

724
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,150
carry the game for so long.

725
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,020
Another update.

726
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,540
It's now been confirmed.

727
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,760
Sources at both the
Pentagon and the Department

728
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,200
of Homeland Security
are now officially

729
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,030
describing this dark
mass we're seeing

730
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,950
just outside the downtown area
of St. Louis as a black hole.

731
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,730
REPORTER 10:
Now, the best way

732
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,170
to describe a black hole, it's
a gravitational field so strong

733
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,780
that even light can't
escape it's grip.

734
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,390
REPORTER 11: Just
straight to the point,

735
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:41,220
since it emergence
less than half an hour

736
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,740
ago, the hole has consumed
everything in its path.

737
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,140
It's uprooting trees,
it's destroying buildings,

738
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,360
it's even been tearing
apart several major highway

739
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,100
overpasses.

740
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,660
REPORTER 10: This is the
reason for the mass evacuation

741
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,190
here in the St. Louis area.

742
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,620
And as crazy as this is,
given the earlier events,

743
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,800
this is what someone
was worried about.

744
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,630
REPORTER 11: So now,
where does this leave us?

745
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,590
I mean, is there any way
to even stop this thing?

746
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,460
OK, thanks.

747
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,940
Bye.

748
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,810
Ryker's on his way to the
new command center now.

749
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,980
And General Tate?

750
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,110
He's already there.

751
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,990
Good.

752
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,510
I want a new direction.

753
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,470
This thing's already
dangerously out of control.

754
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,730
REPORTER 12: Some
sources putting those numbers

755
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,040
as high as 5,000
with an expectation

756
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,650
that they could double, if not
triple, in the next few hours

757
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,220
if something isn't done to
stop the hole's advance.

758
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,880
Details still spilling in,
but the general picture that's

759
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,310
been developing here
is that some sort of as

760
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,790
yet undisclosed experiment--

761
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,880
Any luck?

762
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,400
No.

763
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,450
Nothing seems to work.

764
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,360
All right.

765
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,840
Just stay calm, Honey.

766
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,370
We're going to be OK.

767
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,800
There's a lot of gas
stations in this town,

768
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,540
we're going to find another one.

769
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,550
I give up.

770
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,160
There's no getting through.

771
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,340
How much further
to that memorial?

772
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,910
About 2, 2 and 1/2 miles out.

773
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,870
General.

774
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,000
KAYLEY: No, it's me, dad.

775
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,570
Kayley, how are you?

776
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,090
I'm fine.

777
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,400
Where's your mother?

778
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,230
She's here.

779
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,140
Eric.

780
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,270
Thank God.

781
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,620
Where are you?

782
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,710
We're just a few
miles from the house.

783
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,410
We're right near this thing.

784
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,150
Eric, we're almost out of gas,
and I don't know what to do.

785
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,710
I'll come and get you.

786
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,760
Tell me where you are exactly.

787
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,420
We're in the corner of
State and 59th street.

788
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,810
OK.
Stay there.

789
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:38,990
I'm coming for you.

790
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,030
All right, I'm
going to pull over.

791
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,340
ERIC BRYCE: It's on the way.

792
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,010
MAN 8: [OVER
TELEPHONE] So you've

793
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,490
maintained visual
contact with the creature

794
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,750
through the news copters,
but completely lost

795
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,880
contact with the scientists?

796
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,580
GENERAL TATE: That
is affirmative, sir.

797
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,930
No one's heard from Dr. Bryce
or his associate, Ms. Muir,

798
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,980
since evaluating the facility.

799
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,280
I think it's safe to
assume they're dead.

800
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,890
MAN 8: Ryker.

801
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,380
My only recommendation is
to wait a few minutes to see

802
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,120
if they somehow make contact.

803
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,900
Doctor Bryce is convinced that
the creature might hold the key

804
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,250
to stopping the hole's advance.

805
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,600
MAN 8:
10 more minutes,

806
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,000
and we have to start
thinking action.

807
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,740
We're going to be fine, Honey.

808
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,570
Come on, Eric.

809
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,060
Why are you so mad at dad?

810
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,360
You know, we just
don't get along.

811
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,800
You'll understand
when you're older.

812
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,060
- Dad says the same thing.

813
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,410
Dad!

814
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,240
Hey, how are you?

815
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,110
I'm all right.

816
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,160
OK.

817
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,980
Let's hurry, get into the van.

818
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,380
You didn't tell me
Shannon was coming.

819
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,290
Let's go.

820
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,680
We're in a hurry.

821
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,560
REPORTER 13: From
the onlooker's perspective,

822
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,260
it may seem a bit chaotic,
but we're transporting people,

823
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,660
we're getting help to them, and
we're getting people treated.

824
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,350
REPORTER 14: [OVER
RADIO] So you're

825
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,050
saying there's a good chance
these people will make it out

826
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,570
of here alive?

827
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,230
REPORTER 13:
We're doing all we can.

828
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,050
In a situation like this,
that's the best you can ask for.

829
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,890
Three minutes.

830
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,540
REPORTER 15: I am
standing here overlooking

831
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,330
the 5570 interchange where
you can see the number of cars

832
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,460
we're talking about.

833
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,290
An entire city's
worth of vehicles

834
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,250
crammed under six
major highways leading

835
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,030
out of the St. Louis area.

836
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,730
There is no way to handle
this kind of volume.

837
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,380
Ever since the
call for evacuation

838
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,650
earlier this morning, the
highways have been at a near--

839
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,820
Anyone?

840
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,040
No.

841
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,830
Dad, I'll keep trying.

842
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,350
Eric, what's going on?

843
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,310
What's going to happen if you
don't get in touch with them?

844
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,400
The president's going to
authorize a nuclear strike

845
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,920
on the black hole.

846
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,180
Nuclear?

847
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,100
It's all right, Honey.

848
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,140
Don't worry.

849
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,670
It's not going to happen.

850
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,750
WOMAN 1: Ah,
yeah, can you hear me?

851
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,360
Hello?

852
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,020
REPORTER 16:
Cindy, can you tell me where

853
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,590
you are, what you're seeing?

854
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,240
WOMAN 1:
I'm at a dead standstill

855
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,720
here on the 40 West, trying
to get out of the city--

856
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:46,560
OK, I'm going to get out here.

857
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,440
What do we do now?

858
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:01,930
I have important
information for General Ryker.

859
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,500
Sir, get back, or I'll
be forced to shoot you.

860
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,280
Then shoot me.

861
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:14,330
Sir, we have
critical information.

862
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,810
Get back!

863
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,290
Everybody, move back!

864
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,820
MAN 9: This
is an evacuation red zone.

865
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,650
You might want to be sure to
stay with me here on this one.

866
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,610
It appears as though the
eastern edge of the black hole

867
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,180
is closing in on the stadium.

868
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,700
Where exactly are you, Russ?

869
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,270
RUSS MARTIN: Well, I'm
just south of the stadium,

870
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,620
but you can see
the hole advancing.

871
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,840
I have never witnessed
destruction on this scale

872
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,530
before.

873
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,540
The amount of debris already
in the short time is immense.

874
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,190
It's probably not clear
from where you guys are,

875
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,580
but from up here, real close--

876
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,460
You could just about see--
supports this-- starting

877
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,980
to-- hold on, here it comes.

878
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:53,980
It's ripping.

879
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,200
It's starting to tear apart.

880
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,770
This is truly unbelievable.

881
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,070
I don't know if
you're getting this,

882
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,730
but, if I didn't
know better, I would

883
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:05,820
say I was watching Lego Bots
being sucked up by a giant--

884
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,090
the whole thing is gone.

885
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,660
Guys, the power of this black
hole is absolutely frightening.

886
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,310
And I've got to be
honest with you,

887
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,360
I am starting to wonder how
anyone is seriously planning

888
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,570
on stopping this thing.

889
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,230
GENERAL TATE: Time's up.

890
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,500
Sir, we still have not
received word from Dr. Bryce.

891
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,590
And I think we have no
option but to start making

892
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,680
immediate preparations
for a full nuclear strike

893
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,420
on, both, the hole
and the power entity.

894
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,330
ERIC BRYCE: Wait.

895
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:41,980
You can't do that.

896
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:42,990
I have an option.

897
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,380
I like your timing, Doctor.

898
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,640
General, this is Dr. Bryce and
his colleague, Shannon Muir.

899
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:49,770
We've been
working with General

900
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,820
Ryker since early this morning.

901
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,080
HAYES: Dr. Bryce, just in time.

902
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,690
Everyone here is aware of
your involvement today.

903
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,180
But frankly, we can't
delay any further.

904
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,700
Now, I need to understand
what it is you're proposing

905
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,140
and how you plan on getting it
done, or my decision's made.

906
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,840
Now, you have three minutes.

907
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,880
All right.

908
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,450
I checked the rate of
increase of the hole's growth

909
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,450
against the power authorities
record of outages and surges,

910
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,760
and the two match perfectly.

911
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,720
It is my belief that the entity
and the hole are connected.

912
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,720
And that if we can get
the two of them together,

913
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,730
the reaction will
send both of them

914
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,770
to another part of the universe.

915
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,080
You know, this sounds
awfully convenient to me.

916
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,780
That's--

917
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:39,820
General, let's say that this
is a plane of the universe.

918
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,090
Here we are, point
A. And let's say

919
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:47,270
we have some distant
planet, or galaxy, point B.

920
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:49,660
Now, we've always been
taught that the shortest

921
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,360
distance between two points
is a straight line, like this.

922
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,410
But Einstein believed
that the power of gravity

923
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:01,240
is so great that it can bend
light, space, even time.

924
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,110
So the shortest distance
between two points

925
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:07,550
is no longer this,
but is in fact, this.

926
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:11,030
With point A literally
touching point B,

927
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:14,770
creating a temporary tear
in the fabric of space,

928
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:18,430
so that something
that's very far away

929
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:22,870
can show up on our
doorstep in an instant.

930
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,830
Now, somehow, this entity
is using black holes

931
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,480
to travel back and forth
across the universe,

932
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,790
maybe even back and
forth across time.

933
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,790
So it made contact
with this black hole

934
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,270
and just chose to come here.

935
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,060
No, not exactly.

936
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,060
It needs a weakness in
the space time fabric

937
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,930
that allows the entity
to punch through.

938
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,020
Now, as a result of Dr.
Hauser's experiment,

939
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,980
it found that weakness
in the here and now.

940
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,070
Oh, this is just a bunch
of egghead mumbo jumbo.

941
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,900
If we don't take practical
steps against this thing,

942
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,640
it's going to eat the whole
eastern half of Missouri.

943
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,170
General, hear him out.

944
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,560
Look, even if I bought
into this proposition

945
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,610
that somehow popping this
entity back into the hole

946
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,650
will destroy the
both of them, how

947
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,310
do you suggest we
actually control

948
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,740
the creature's movements?

949
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,700
I mean, how do we get
it back into the hole,

950
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,700
when everything suggests
it's moving away from it?

951
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,100
It is not moving
away from anything it.

952
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,100
It is moving toward
increased voltage sources.

953
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,970
Now, if we can redirect all
of the energy and electricity

954
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,330
in this area to a
single substation,

955
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,150
I think we can
isolate the entity.

956
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,160
And then?

957
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,330
Well, it responds to sound.

958
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,420
We can manipulate its behavior
by using certain frequencies.

959
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,510
General, what about we
bring in special forces

960
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,380
and equip them with
concussion grenades?

961
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,390
Now, a shipping
container equipped

962
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:49,950
with large magnetic coils could
trap the entity in its field

963
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,220
for the short period of
time needed to airlift

964
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,090
it back to the black hole.

965
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,090
Tate, can you handle this?

966
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,750
Well, we still don't
know if it will work.

967
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:01,580
We can do it, sir.

968
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,200
Divert the power and
move a team into place.

969
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,460
This is your shot, Dr. Bryce.

970
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,810
Thank you.

971
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,200
General.

972
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,900
Well, nowhere
yet from Washington

973
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:25,860
on a plan to stop
the destruction.

974
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,820
Meanwhile, the black hole is
advancing at a steady pace.

975
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,210
What?
I'm sorry.

976
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,470
Yeah, OK.

977
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,000
We're going to go
here to Russ Martin.

978
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,000
Russ.

979
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,170
What a dramatic display.

980
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,130
This black hole
is not letting up.

981
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,790
It is basically following
a path from the stadium

982
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,350
to the Gateway Arch.

983
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,010
Unbelievable.

984
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,180
The old courthouse building
is about to become history.

985
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,030
Those were just panels
from the observation deck.

986
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,730
Oh, man.
It's pulling apart.

987
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,730
The Gateway Arch is
being pulled apart.

988
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,080
Look at the rain of debris.

989
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,650
The St. Louis Arch
is falling apart.

990
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,660
I don't believe my eyes.

991
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,880
The St. Louis Gateway
Arch has just fallen.

992
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,750
Are you all right?

993
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,280
- I'm all right.

994
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,970
What are they going
to do, Shannon?

995
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,370
He's inside.

996
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:39,720
It's OK.

997
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,070
He's figured out a way
to stop this thing.

998
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,980
- There's food and water inside.

999
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,980
Come on, let's get
away from all this.

1000
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,260
MAN 10: Bravo team,
what's your status?

1001
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,440
Coordinates for the target.

1002
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:16,970
MAN 11: ETA is good.

1003
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:17,970
This is Heavy 52.

1004
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,150
MAN 11: Copy that.

1005
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,500
I have visual on
the power plant.

1006
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,290
Heavy 290.

1007
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:33,160
Over.

1008
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,780
MAN 13: LC is safe and secure.

1009
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,860
MAN 14: 18,000s or 18,000.

1010
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,650
We are at the staging area.

1011
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,560
Good luck boys.

1012
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,390
Be careful.

1013
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,260
All right.

1014
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,130
Gear up.

1015
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,960
Locked and loaded.

1016
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,150
MAN 15: This is 49.

1017
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,550
I've got you at 3 o'clock.

1018
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,290
Drop zone is about 100
meters straight in.

1019
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:12,110
Over.

1020
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,210
49, we're coming down now.

1021
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,210
MAN 15: Roger that, 52.

1022
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,690
You're at 15 meters.

1023
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,690
12 meters.

1024
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,830
10 meters.

1025
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:30,700
5 meters.

1026
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,490
Touchdown.

1027
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,880
Disconnect now.

1028
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:44,800
All right, this is it.

1029
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,850
Ropes.

1030
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,370
Both sides, go!

1031
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,940
Go go go go go!

1032
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,720
Move!

1033
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:17,660
MAN 16: Go go go.

1034
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,110
Don't be shy.

1035
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,940
Grab a grenade.

1036
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,930
Ready.

1037
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,980
Copy that.

1038
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:18,850
Secure the perimeter.

1039
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:50,270
Are we going to
be able to touch

1040
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,010
our communication with the
entity ZM interference?

1041
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,840
Cameras and mics
and multiple feeds.

1042
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,410
Any data loss on one,
to be placed on another.

1043
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,110
Steadiest connection we have.

1044
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,150
What about the sonics
blasting through the line?

1045
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,370
Well, the computer
automatically

1046
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,460
removes the blasting frequency.

1047
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,770
That allows us to
maintain contact.

1048
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,260
All systems up and ready.

1049
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,740
OK, command, you can
divert power now.

1050
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,260
Copy.

1051
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,740
Divert all power.

1052
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,310
MAN 17: All the power, sir?

1053
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,360
You heard me.

1054
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,270
All power.

1055
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,750
And pray that this thing
falls for our little trap.

1056
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,110
Uhuh.

1057
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,630
We will.
Don't do one.

1058
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,420
Just turn them all off.
Turn them all off.

1059
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,240
Yeah, OK.

1060
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,290
Uhuh.
Yeah.

1061
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:52,120
We're doing it, sir.

1062
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:59,730
MAN 18: Power is off.

1063
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,650
I repeat power is off.

1064
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:13,750
OK, guys, we're looking live.

1065
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:14,570
Standby.

1066
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,540
Target is moving.

1067
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,880
Repeat.

1068
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,020
Target is moving towards
the abduction point.

1069
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,150
Looks like it's taking the bait.

1070
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,550
Take your positions.
202 on the lead.

1071
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:35,380
101 is fallback.

1072
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,820
You ready for this?

1073
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:46,690
Locked and loaded.

1074
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,660
Target is closing.

1075
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,490
Building speed.

1076
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,280
ETA.

1077
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,060
PILOT 2: I'd say less than five.

1078
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,800
I feel like I'm in
a stupid video game.

1079
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,370
Everybody stay quiet.

1080
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,850
PILOT 2: Delta, ready yourself.

1081
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,460
Target is closing.

1082
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,290
100 meters to engagement.

1083
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,250
Copy.

1084
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,460
100 meters to engagement.

1085
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,470
Come in.

1086
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:22,340
We have visual.

1087
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,600
Preparing to engage.

1088
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,510
Copy.

1089
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,340
Hold your position.

1090
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:36,700
Everybody stay quiet.

1091
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,660
Our presence may
have been detected.

1092
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,060
Command, do you read?

1093
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,280
I repeat.

1094
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,890
Our presence may
have been detected.

1095
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,110
Spread out.

1096
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:56,240
Get ready to circle back.

1097
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:11,560
Round one, go.

1098
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:17,650
Round two, go.

1099
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,050
Round three, go.

1100
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:00,430
We have two men down.

1101
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,220
Hold your ground.

1102
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:13,880
Round five.

1103
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:38,780
Fall back!

1104
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:39,650
GENERAL RYKER: No.

1105
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:40,950
Hold your ground.

1106
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,650
MAN 19: Target is no
longer responding.

1107
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:45,390
Request permission
for extraction.

1108
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,610
Negative.

1109
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,570
Stand your ground.

1110
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,620
Stand your ground.

1111
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:13,120
My God.

1112
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:21,080
I want all key personnel
evacuated immediately.

1113
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,870
General Tate, get ready to
go nuclear on this thing.

1114
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,690
- Nuclear is a mistake, General.
- Get him out of here!

1115
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:27,520
I'm telling you,
do not go nuclear!

1116
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,480
Take him outside!

1117
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,480
Take him now!

1118
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,440
Ryker, you explain to him!

1119
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,440
You had your chance!

1120
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,610
Give up!

1121
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,050
You're going to
get two of them.

1122
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,700
You're going to get three.

1123
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:40,970
There's no chance anything
you do will have an effect!

1124
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:43,490
Let him go.

1125
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,020
Stand back.

1126
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,760
Look, General, you
can't let them do this.

1127
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,590
You're heard him, Doctor.

1128
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,590
You had your chance.

1129
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,680
Now, make sure you
all get to safety.

1130
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,850
Safety?

1131
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,640
Safety where?

1132
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,510
The bombs are not going
to solve the problem.

1133
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:03,040
The hole will continue to
grow and grow and grow, taking

1134
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,260
in the entire city,
then the country,

1135
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:10,520
and then the entire planet
will collapse in on itself.

1136
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,310
Tate and Hayes have a plan.

1137
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:13,350
It's a worthless plan.

1138
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:18,090
I'm sorry Doctor.

1139
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:30,890
General.

1140
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,850
General.

1141
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:38,940
What if we didn't have
to trap the entity?

1142
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,070
What if we only had to
lure it back into the hole?

1143
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,770
I'm listening.

1144
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,340
What if we rig one of
those generator trucks

1145
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:51,470
with enough electricity to
attract the entity, right?

1146
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,130
Then we just drive the truck to
the black hole with the entity

1147
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:57,390
until past the gravitational
point of no return.

1148
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,480
Those trucks generate
1,000 amps max.

1149
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:01,530
That thing is sitting over
there in that substation

1150
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,960
like a bear in a tub of honey.

1151
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,490
Why is it going to leave
the substation to chase

1152
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:06,190
something with 1/100 its power?

1153
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:07,710
It wouldn't.

1154
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,540
Not if we turn off all the
power to the substation

1155
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,320
and all the power to
the surrounding area.

1156
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,930
It'll make that truck look like
the brightest star in the sky.

1157
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:19,810
And if it doesn't work,
what's the difference?

1158
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:20,980
Who's going to drive?

1159
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,900
I will.

1160
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:22,770
No, we will.

1161
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,510
Lieutenant.

1162
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:27,080
I want you to help
Dr. Bryce here.

1163
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,340
He'll explain what
needs to be done.

1164
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,820
This is between you and me
and whoever you need to help.

1165
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,950
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,130
Go.

1167
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:35,740
Lieutenant, thank
you very much.

1168
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,430
I want this generator truck
packed with as much power

1169
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,260
as we can.

1170
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,570
This just in.

1171
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,480
We have now been informed that
the government's first plan

1172
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:46,010
of action for
dealing with the hole

1173
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:48,360
has proved a total failure.

1174
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,360
Will the president
now consider

1175
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,010
the nuclear weapons option?

1176
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,580
Well, you know,
it's interesting

1177
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:55,190
because it's not currently
known how many people are

1178
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:56,370
still remaining in the area.

1179
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,280
MAN 20: Please
keep moving moving.

1180
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,540
Do not block the intersection.

1181
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:05,940
All vehicles are subject to
military evacuation orders.

1182
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,600
You are in an
evacuation red zone.

1183
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,730
Please keep moving.

1184
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:12,600
Yes, sir.

1185
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,210
That is affirmative.

1186
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,780
We'll have full military
evac in less than 20 minutes.

1187
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,170
Keep me updated.

1188
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:20,220
I need to contact the president.

1189
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,910
Tell him he needs to work on
his address to the nation.

1190
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,610
We're still waiting
for an update,

1191
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:27,180
but we do have word from the
Department of Homeland Security

1192
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,530
that they are close to issuing
a report to the White House.

1193
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,830
We can only guess--

1194
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,190
Where you've been?

1195
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,280
Just wanted to make
sure that Dr. Bryce knew

1196
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,020
the least we could do is
get his family to safety

1197
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,670
before dropping the bomb.

1198
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,330
We're only doing
what has to be done.

1199
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,940
I know that, sir, but
that doesn't make it right.

1200
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:55,160
How are we looking from
an evacuation standpoint

1201
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:56,300
out there?

1202
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,340
Everything's
squared away, sir.

1203
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,040
Whenever you're ready to leave.

1204
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,050
How are we doing?

1205
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:13,310
We're almost done.

1206
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,880
Got to move fast.

1207
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,010
The president is getting
ready to address the nation.

1208
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,410
Anyone who wants to get
out of here has to go now.

1209
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,880
- Inside.

1210
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:21,800
I'll finish up here.

1211
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,630
You go.

1212
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,200
Hey.

1213
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,550
Eric, what's going on?

1214
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,550
They're saying on the radio
that the president's going to go

1215
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:36,340
ahead with the nuclear strike.
- He is.

1216
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,900
My God.

1217
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:39,690
Listen, the general has
arranged for the two of you

1218
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:41,430
to get on an army helicopter.

1219
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,470
Hey, but what about you?

1220
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,820
I'm going to stick around.

1221
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,690
There's one more thing
I'm going to try.

1222
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:48,560
We're running out of time.

1223
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:49,960
OK, you guys hurry on.

1224
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,180
Everything's going to be OK.
Don't you worry.

1225
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,440
OK.
But take care of her.

1226
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,440
You get your
people squared away?

1227
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,310
Dr. Bryce's wife and
daughter are on their way

1228
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,360
to the copters.

1229
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,100
What about Bryce?

1230
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,580
He and Shannon are wrapping
up the last of the equipment.

1231
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,930
For what?

1232
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,540
I didn't take the time to ask?

1233
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,190
Well, take the time to
call them and tell them

1234
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,200
they had better DD
Most Ricky Tick,

1235
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,890
because we're on the
clock now, and it's not

1236
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,720
stopping for anybody,
especially not

1237
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,330
a couple of airdales
who've already cost us

1238
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,070
more time than we can afford.
- Yes, sir.

1239
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,990
If you'll excuse me.

1240
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:21,120
Ryker.

1241
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,380
Is there something
going on around here

1242
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,210
that I don't know about?

1243
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,300
I don't see how
that's possible, sir.

1244
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,080
You're in charge.

1245
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,700
Turn it on now.

1246
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,960
Now, if that doesn't
look like a meal

1247
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:43,180
to that energy-eating piece of
crap, I don't know what will.

1248
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,970
That's excellent.
GENERAL RYKER: Lieutenant.

1249
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:48,150
One second, General.

1250
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:50,280
I bet when you woke up
this morning you didn't

1251
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,930
think you'd be driving a
truck into a black hole,

1252
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,590
especially with me.

1253
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:55,330
No, I thought I'd wake
up, have a few more drinks,

1254
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:56,200
pass out back on the couch.

1255
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:15,390
Eric.

1256
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,520
But I'm driving.

1257
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:20,050
Eric.

1258
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,050
Unlock the door!

1259
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:23,530
What are you doing?

1260
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:26,050
What are you doing, Eric?

1261
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,530
Come on!

1262
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:28,930
Can't let you do this, Eric!

1263
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:29,840
Will you step off--

1264
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,840
Ma'am.

1265
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,360
I can't let you do this.

1266
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:33,370
Eric!

1267
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:36,320
Eric!

1268
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:37,240
You can't!

1269
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,240
No, Eric!

1270
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:45,810
Damn it.

1271
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:46,860
Sorry, ma'am.

1272
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,950
Orders.

1273
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,730
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.

1274
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:51,690
Wait for me at the copter.

1275
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:53,080
Yes, sir.

1276
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,780
Shannon, there was
no need for both of you

1277
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,340
to get on that truck.

1278
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:57,610
Come on now, the
copter's waiting.

1279
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,220
Yeah, they can
leave without me.

1280
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,090
Shannon.

1281
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:02,050
- Look.
- Shannon.

1282
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,220
No.

1283
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,050
If he's driving,
the least I can do

1284
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,570
is help him figure
out when that truck is

1285
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,440
going to hit the
point of no return,

1286
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,620
so he can jump when he needs to.

1287
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,010
You can do that
from the helicopter.

1288
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:12,530
No, I can't.

1289
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,320
The computers with the
modeling software are here.

1290
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,540
We break them down,
set them back up,

1291
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:18,240
it's going to be too late.

1292
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,890
You'll die if he
doesn't make it.

1293
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:25,680
Which is why I have
faith that he will.

1294
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,770
I understand.

1295
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,550
Go.

1296
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,780
What's happened
to our scientists?

1297
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,690
They're staying behind.

1298
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,520
What?
Why?

1299
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,480
They're trying one last
time to stop this thing

1300
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,000
before you drop your bomb.

1301
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,440
And why wasn't I informed?

1302
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,310
Because you wouldn't
have allowed it.

1303
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:50,490
Well, just so
as you understand,

1304
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:52,010
when it comes time
to drop the bomb,

1305
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:53,360
this isn't going to
affect my decision.

1306
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,420
We're ready with your
address Mr. President.

1307
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:16,820
Let's hear it.

1308
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,040
My fellow Americans,
it is with great sorrow

1309
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,820
that I come to you tonight to
explain the chain of events

1310
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,950
which forced this
government to unleash

1311
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,830
a nuclear weapon on its
own citizens and to mourn--

1312
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:30,260
The thousands of people
lost in the tragedy.

1313
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:34,440
The sacrifice of the citizens
of St. Louis was not in vain

1314
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:35,270
as--

1315
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:47,150
Dr. Bryce, if you can
read me, where are you?

1316
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,940
I'm about three miles from
the substation, General.

1317
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,150
You need to hurry.

1318
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,630
The White House is
going to authorize

1319
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,770
a strike in a few minutes.

1320
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:55,720
I know.

1321
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:58,070
Is Shannon there with you?

1322
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,510
GENERAL RYKER: No.

1323
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:01,860
Is she on a
different helicopter?

1324
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,300
She refused to come.

1325
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,650
What?

1326
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:07,740
Get her on the line right now.

1327
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,040
I'm here.

1328
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:12,050
As countless
Americans and likely

1329
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:15,610
the entire planet were safe
from utter annihilation.

1330
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,570
So such sacrifice
should always be

1331
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,180
looked on with great respect.

1332
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,270
Good.

1333
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,140
There were many
in St. Louis who

1334
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:25,540
tried hard to help evacuate as
many as they could in the hours

1335
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,230
leading up to the strike.

1336
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,670
And it is without question
that some of them, our bravest,

1337
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:34,890
lost their lives tonight
in such noble endeavors.

1338
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,200
They are our greatest
unsung heroes.

1339
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,460
Excellent, Mr. President.

1340
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:44,380
What are you doing, Shannon?

1341
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:46,170
Why didn't you get on
one of the helicopters?

1342
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,560
And let you have all the fun?

1343
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,000
Listen to me.

1344
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,740
Tate may drop the bomb
before I manage to get

1345
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,350
the entity back in the hole.

1346
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,090
You need to get
out of there now.

1347
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:58,130
I'm not going
anywhere, not until I

1348
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,480
make sure you're
not in that truck

1349
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,440
when it crosses the
point of no return.

1350
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:03,360
I love you, Eric.

1351
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,580
I'm-- I'm not leaving.

1352
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,100
We're doing this together.

1353
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,140
All right, lovebirds.

1354
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:08,840
Don't forget I'm in on this too.

1355
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,540
I'm not going to let you two
showoffs take all the credit.

1356
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,760
OK, General.

1357
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,980
Then get ready to
lose us some power.

1358
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:20,590
I'm here.

1359
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,380
Copy.

1360
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:49,230
These are the times
to come together.

1361
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:51,270
No one in this
nation or this world

1362
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,370
can walk away from
today's event unaffected

1363
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,850
because they remind
us of just how

1364
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:59,330
fragile our existence can be.

1365
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:04,200
So I ask you to join me to
reach out to your neighbors,

1366
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,200
your families in
a way that you may

1367
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,900
have thought of in the past.

1368
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,600
But never actually done.

1369
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,080
Exactly.

1370
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,820
Work through differences,
forgive past mistakes.

1371
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,300
And hold each other
close in support.

1372
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:20,610
Out of such destruction,
proving that together,

1373
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:24,480
we can always rise above.

1374
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:25,700
Thank you for your time.

1375
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,830
And God bless America.

1376
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,570
Excellent, Mr. President.

1377
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,490
Thank you.

1378
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:33,230
Thank you.

1379
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:34,100
Send the bombers up.

1380
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,370
Yeah.

1381
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,550
It's a go.

1382
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:46,630
GENERAL TATE: Yes,
Mr. Secretary.

1383
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,290
Confirming we have a go.

1384
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,640
All right, people,
we have approval.

1385
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,940
The launch is go.

1386
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,600
The launch is go.

1387
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,990
Initiate watch.

1388
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:55,990
Initiate watch.

1389
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,780
Mission is go.

1390
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:58,860
MAN 22: Roger, team leader.

1391
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,480
ERIC BRYCE: Ryker.

1392
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,960
Copy.

1393
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:11,490
I'm set.

1394
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,880
Just so you know,
bombers are in the air.

1395
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,530
Try and delay them if you can.

1396
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:16,400
Negative.

1397
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,750
Not possible.

1398
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,020
You're going to have
to beat them to it.

1399
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,760
Copy.

1400
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,980
We're taking the power down.

1401
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:36,030
Doctor, I doubt if I can
get you back online again.

1402
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,640
I'll be pulling for you.

1403
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:38,950
MAN 24: Turning off power now.

1404
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:55,750
Come on!

1405
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,150
It's taking the bait.

1406
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:15,030
You're a heck of
a soldier, Doctor.

1407
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,120
Was that Bryce?

1408
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:25,560
Yes.

1409
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,560
Still working on his plan?

1410
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:30,000
Well, at least you
have to give the man

1411
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,700
credit for his determination.

1412
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:41,530
You're at three miles.

1413
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,880
ERIC BRYCE: This thing's
faster than we thought.

1414
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:53,200
Well, we are now finally
hearing news from the White

1415
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,760
House that the president has
scheduled a press conference

1416
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,590
one half hour from now.

1417
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,460
Downtown St. Louis
has been destroyed.

1418
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:01,990
What people remain
here are panicked.

1419
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,250
Perhaps all we have
left, is prayer.

1420
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:07,950
Are you sure we made
the right decision?

1421
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,950
I'm not sure how many
choices we had, sir.

1422
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,440
How far out am I?

1423
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:26,190
You have less than two miles
until you hit the outer limit.

1424
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,800
Is the entity with you?

1425
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,140
Of course it is.

1426
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:45,990
I have have no visual
on secondary target.

1427
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:47,030
Repeat.

1428
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,470
No visual on secondary target.

1429
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:50,380
What?

1430
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,430
PILOT 3: Repeat.

1431
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:53,210
No visual on secondary target.

1432
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,040
Standby.

1433
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:00,260
Got a visual on
secondary target.

1434
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:01,960
Heading towards primary.

1435
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,310
The secondary has
somehow attached itself

1436
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,620
to a vehicle of some kind.

1437
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,180
A truck.

1438
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:11,970
And they're heading
towards primary.

1439
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:14,710
Did you have anything
to do with this?

1440
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,410
You've gotten so
used to those stars,

1441
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:18,190
you've forgotten
you're a soldier.

1442
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,630
I could have you court
martialed for going

1443
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,020
around behind my back.

1444
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:23,760
You're right, General.

1445
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:26,460
If I had to do it all over
again, I'd still go around you.

1446
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,690
Sky Fox One, this
is Blue Leader.

1447
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,600
Initiate target acquisition.

1448
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,730
Sector Sierra, Echo,
Tango, Zulu, Lima, Five.

1449
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:38,650
PILOT 3: Setting target.

1450
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:44,050
SHANNON MUIR: Eric, you're
close to the point of no return.

1451
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,570
OK, I see it.

1452
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:49,620
Tell me when I'm a mile out.

1453
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:51,970
What?

1454
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,970
Tell me when I'm one mile out.

1455
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,670
You're coming up on it now.

1456
01:21:56,710 --> 01:22:03,280
Five, four, three.
- OK.

1457
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:06,070
SHANNON MUIR: Two, one.

1458
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,940
Now!

1459
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,120
PILOT 3: I have secondary
target on unidentified vehicle.

1460
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,860
Closing on target one.

1461
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,600
Do you want me to engage?

1462
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,470
Think of the
ramifications of this.

1463
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,210
There is no
guarantee the bombing

1464
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,870
is going to kill this creature.

1465
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,830
It seems to me it's
worth the chance.

1466
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:28,220
If you kill this thing,
and Dr. Bryce is right,

1467
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,830
we're destroying the only
chance of stopping that hole.

1468
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:33,010
Give him another minute.

1469
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,180
For all our sakes.

1470
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,580
PILOT 3: Do you
want me to engage?

1471
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,010
Repeat.

1472
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:40,060
Do you want me to engage?
- That is negative.

1473
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,450
Unengage with Sky Fox One.

1474
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,020
Hold visual on target.

1475
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,890
I say again, hold
visual on target.

1476
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:48,150
Holding visual.

1477
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,020
I repeat.

1478
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,200
Holding visual.

1479
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,720
Sir.

1480
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:52,550
Give them another minute.

1481
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:02,950
It looks like your
horse gets his chance.

1482
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:05,300
It's not just
my horse, General.

1483
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,350
The whole world's
riding on this one.

1484
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,880
SHANNON MUIR: Eric,
you're getting too close.

1485
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:24,800
You've got to jump, now!

1486
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:30,980
Eric!

1487
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:31,850
Eric!

1488
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,810
No!

1489
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:39,810
No!

1490
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,210
No, no, no!

1491
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:48,950
Eric, can you hear me?

1492
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:49,740
Eric.

1493
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,140
Eric!

1494
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,340
PILOT 3: Sky Fox going cold.

1495
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:27,120
Weapons off.

1496
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:30,520
Sky Fox heading back to base.

1497
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,910
All right!

1498
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:34,260
Well done, sir.

1499
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,130
Excellent job.

1500
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:37,610
Eric, can you hear me?

1501
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:56,240
Well, somebody's got himself
some new beachfront property.

1502
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,940
Do you want me
to do another pass?

1503
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:01,940
You'll be running out of fuel.

1504
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,110
Don't worry.

1505
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:03,940
We'll find him.

1506
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:09,340
I lost him.

1507
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:12,650
Where is that faith
you told me you had?

1508
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,130
Don't loose it.

1509
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:16,610
I've got a lot of
confidence in him.

1510
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:17,430
He's a fighter.

1511
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,310
Wait.

1512
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,230
What's that there?

1513
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,450
Make another
pass on the right.

1514
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:15,230
Dad!

1515
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,060
Hey!

1516
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:22,850
Oh, you look great!

1517
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,370
Oh, you all right?

1518
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,070
Yeah.

1519
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:39,340
Let's go see Shannon.

1520
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,730
Hi, Shannon.

1521
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,300
Hi!

1522
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,650
Good job, General.

1523
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:46,260
Thank you, Doctor.

1524
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,180
You have one heck of a
father here, young lady.

1525
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,050
We did it.

1526
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:52,880
Oh, we did it.

1527
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,050
All right.
