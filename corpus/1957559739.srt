[Sam]
<i>I never believed in fate</i>

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,904
<i>or destiny, kismet,
whatever you want to call it.</i>

00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:16,443
<i>Never believed in Santa,

<i>The supernatural.</i>

00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,949

8
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:23,951
<i>No.</i>

9
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,322
<i>I never believed
in anything really.</i>

10
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,527
<i>And then I met Floyd.</i>

11
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,435
Let's talk about that
for a moment, Sam, if we could.

12
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,304
I believe that's chapter...

13
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:47,642
Yes, chapter three
from the book.

[opera music]

15
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,381
[Sam] I don't remember much
of the night I met Floyd.

16
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,552
I remember
that I was intoxicated

17
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:02,522
and had been since
around 1:30 that afternoon.

18
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,926
[groans] Fuck.

19
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,294
<i>I remember that
I couldn't pay my rent again</i>

20
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,731
<i>and that I hadn't paid it
for five months.</i>

21
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:11,666
It's all over everywhere!

22
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,268
<i>I remember that it had been
a year since Kathleen dumped me.</i>

23
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,840
<i>Almost two since my mother died.</i>

24
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:25,378
<i>And everything felt incrementally
shittier with each passing day.</i>

25
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,915
- [glass breaks]
- Fuck!

26
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,284
<i>And I remember that I took
a brief mental inventory,</i>

27
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,254
<i>considered my overwhelming
lack of prospects,</i>

28
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,257
and in my state
of absolute crapulance...

29
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,527
...came to the superb
conclusion that...

30
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,066
...that it's time to go.

- [doctor] <i>Well, there was the associated puncture</i>

<i>of the right lung, of course.</i>

- <i>Uh, the bladder is functioning quite well now.</i>
- <i>Hmm.</i>

88
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,309
So he won't need, uh,
diapers or anything

89
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,911
- permanently?
- No, he will not.

90
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,783
Can you smoke in here?

91
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,252
I'm afraid you can't.

92
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:31,859
He exited the coma at
approximately 9:15 last night.

93
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:36,930
His last recollection is being in
the city on the day of the accident.

94
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:43,003
He's lucid, communicative if not somewhat
despondent, which is to be expected.

95
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,106
He will recover.
But I should tell you

96
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,542
that there may be some
hurdles in the near term.

97
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,412
What kind of hurdles?

98
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,615
Oh, he may experience
mood swings,

99
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:56,850
agitation, occasional confusion,
but, uh...

100
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:00,054
...that should
dissipate with time.

101
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:06,860
The brain.

102
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:10,230
The brain is an incredible
instrument, Floyd,

103
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,635
capable of the most
amazing things.

104
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:17,371
But for all of its tremendous
power and magnificence,

105
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:22,543
it is incredibly fragile
and remarkably sensitive.

106
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:27,848
<i>And miracles aside, with all the
trauma that Samuel has suffered,</i>

107
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:31,185
<i>it may be some time before
his faculties come back to him.</i>

108
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,889
<i>Truth be told, he may never be
that Samuel again.</i>

109
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:50,537
[soft clattering]

110
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:56,944
How are you doing?

111
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,452
Who are you?

112
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,156
The guy?

113
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,358
My name's Floyd.

114
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,262
Hey.

115
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,035
I guess I should put these
in some water.

116
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,511
You know, a lot of people out
there might frown upon a man

117
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,246
giving another man
some flowers, but...

118
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:37,151
...you don't have to worry about it.
I'm not sweet on men, nothing like that.

119
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,187
I'm a family man.

120
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,593
- And I can assure you that I am definitely a fan of the dames.
- [water pouring]

121
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:50,998
So, uh, Sammy,
please accept these flowers.

122
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,200
- Please don't call me that.
- Call you what?

123
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,404
Sammy. Don't call me Sammy.

124
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,474
Sammy? Sammy is one of the greatest
nicknames in the history of mankind.

125
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,143
- Hands down.
- Nobody calls me that.

126
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,479
I prefer Samuel or...

127
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:08,348
...Sam.

128
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,486
Well, let's go with Sam.

129
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,955
Thank you.

130
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,358
- You really don't like Sammy?
- No, I really don't like it.

131
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,561
Okay. [chuckles]
It's no problem.

132
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:21,528
I'll call you Sam.

133
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,602
[chair rustling]

134
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:34,074
You know, I've been, uh, here quite
a bit since the accident and, uh...

135
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,076
Uh...

136
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,979
[sighs]

137
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:43,685
I'm sorry I hit you.

138
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,123
It just kind of happened.

139
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:57,297
I still don't know what...
How... What...

140
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,607
I'm just... I'm just... I'm just
sorry that I... that I hit you.

141
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,210
It's fine. I'm fine.

142
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,714
I'm here, uh...

143
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:17,084
Besides, I don't remember any of
it, and it could have been worse.

144
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,319
Yeah. Could have been worse.

145
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:21,555
[clears throat]

146
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,631
They said that your father
has not come to this...

147
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:31,198
I... I don't want
to talk about it.

148
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,535
- Okay, I understand.
- [sighs]

149
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,211
Dr. Ike told me
that you were a writer.

150
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,084
So I've been thinking, uh...

151
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,190
...Would you consider
writing my biography?

152
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,829
Uh, I don't...

153
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,565
I'm not really, uh...

154
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:13,140
I mean, thank you for thinking of
me, but I write short stories mostly.

155
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:17,411
The occasionally essay,
a few poems. Biography?

156
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,080
So you don't think
you can do it?

157
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,383
It's not that I can't do it.
Of course I can do it.

158
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,152
I'm capable. It's just...

159
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,624
[sighs]
It's not my thing, Floyd.

160
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,492
No, I understand, you're
an artist. I respect that.

161
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,294
I can... I can see it
and I can feel it.

162
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,596
But I challenge you.

163
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:43,503
I challenge you to at least try
for once to do something different.

164
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:47,642
Because when opportunity knocks on
your door, you might want to answer it,

165
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:50,243
even if she's
wearing a goofy hat.

166
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:53,246
- Huh?
- Just hear me out. I spoke to Dr. Ike,

167
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,282
and he explained to me
the situation

168
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,884
you're in with your landlord
in the city.

169
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:58,686
- Why is he telling you all this?
- No, no, listen,

170
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,454
there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

171
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,422
Everybody skips out
on their rent every so often.

172
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,195
It's nothing. What I'm proposing is
that you come and stay with us out here,

173
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,633
me and my family, until you get
yourself back on your feet.

174
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:17,270
I can give you a cash stipend or a cash advance
if you want to get professional about it.

175
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:20,908
And... and all you have to do is

00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:57,591
I didn't mean to, uh...

348
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,559
Yeah, sorry.

349
00:30:58,592 --> 00:30:59,460
I'll change that out.

350
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:00,527
[player clatters]

351
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:05,599
Fresh take. There you go.

352
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,738
Floyd, you've got a great voice.

353
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:14,007
I used to be able to carry
a tune, but not anymore.

354
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,377
Do you mind if I s... start?

355
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:19,146
I'm an open book.

356
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:27,054
Right, uh, before I do,
regarding the book.

357
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,723
I have to ask.

358
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:33,360
Why are you keeping it a secret?

359
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:35,062
Hmm.

360
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:37,364
It's a good question.

361
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:44,338
We all live multicolored lives.

362
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:47,609
Each and every one of us
and, uh...

363
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,478
...we all have a range
of experiences.

364
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:54,515
- And...
- You've been unfaithful.

365
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:57,217
[laughing]

366
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,822
Let's not shit in the soup
just yet, my friend, okay?

367
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:04,191
I mean, we're gonna pull some teeth but let's
try to ease into it a little bit, right?

368
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:07,729
- Okay.
- For the record, I will say that my wife and I,

369
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:12,299
we have a great relationship,
really terrific, uh...

370
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,502
But I will admit that, uh,
Jacqueline...

371
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,072
Well, we'll get to that.

372
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:24,679
But, uh, what I will say is that
I've had some experiences in my life.

373
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:27,581
Some... some jobs, some things
that I've done that she's...

374
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,551
...not quite aware of per se.

375
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:32,620
Hmm.

376
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:35,355
Like what?

377
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:47,601
Military. Government. Et cetera.

378
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,839
- I'm intrigued.
- Well, there's a lot more where that came from,

379
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:54,374
and we're gonna get there,
and then you'll understand.

380
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:57,244
But back to Jacqueline, she...

381
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:02,215
She also might think that, you know,
me writing my biography is, uh...

382
00:33:03,517 --> 00:33:06,320
- It's a bit, uh...
- Braggadocious?

383
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:09,824
No, I wouldn't say that.

384
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:12,259
That's, uh, that's not
the right word for it.

385
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,161
Hmm. Premature?

386
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:19,232
- No, not that one either.
- Pointless.

387
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,401
Pointless?

388
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:22,336
Well, I certainly...

389
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:29,209
I certainly don't feel
that my life has been pointless.

390
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:31,478
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- No, listen, I've done a lot of...

391
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:40,287
I've done many great things with my
life, things that I'm very proud of,

392
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:44,558
and everybody is going to read
about it when the time is right.

393
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:50,530
Uh, well, uh... Secret's safe.

394
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,903
Um, do you have
a pencil sharpener?

395
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:58,538
That's a pencil sharpener?

396
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,341
Thank you, sir.

397
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:05,445

[voice]
Hey.

400
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,162
Are you all right?

401
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:25,198
[mysterious music]

402
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:25,933
I'm over here.

403
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:29,604
Over here.

404
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:37,477
[ominous music]

405
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:47,955
Is that you talking?

406
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,657
Of course,
who do you think it was?

407
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,693
God. God.

408
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,427
[ominous music]

409
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:55,429
What the fuck?

410
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:56,698
What the fuck is happening?

411
00:34:56,731 --> 00:34:58,866
No, no. Please don't be scared.

412
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,534
- I'm just trying to...
- [door opens]

413
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:01,468
[gasps]

414
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,304
You're up early.

415
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:09,443
Is everything okay? I heard a lot
of yelling and dirty language.

416
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,678
Oh, yeah.

417
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:14,281
Oh, I'm sorry,
appreciate the concern.

418
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:18,720
I was, uh, just...
I was, uh... hoo...

419
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:20,955
I was, uh, doing push ups.

420
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:23,490
With one arm?

421
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:26,526
Uh, yeah, just a few.

422
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:31,598
- I like to stay in shape myself so...
- I can tell.

423
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,333
I mean, yes, obviously.

424
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:36,336
I mean, I mean, of course,
it's... it's good to...

425
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:37,739
[sighs]

426
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:42,476
I should go to work.

427
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,511
Me too. Writing.

428
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:47,014
- The book.
- Yeah.

429
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:48,582
The book.

430
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:51,585
Yeah.

431
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:56,657
Have a good day, Samuel.

432

[door closes]

433
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:05,633
- [mysterious music]
- Hey.

434
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,668
- Let's see her. Let's go.
- All right.

435
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,839
Oh, this is, uh, this is
the guy I hit, my biographer.

436
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:15,375
- Sam. Nick.
- Boy, you did a number on Floyd's caddie.

437
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:17,377
I didn't think
she was gonna make it.

438
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,847
But we got her all done up like
new for you, inside and out.

439
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:22,382
I can't wait to see her
because if I got to drive that

441

- even one more day...
- There she is.

442
00:36:29,624 --> 00:36:31,424
Well, that's... that's, uh...

443
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,562
That's not the same color,
is it?

444
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:38,398
Well, about the color, Floyd,
you see, never really matched

445
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:40,333
the factory tint
on a full repaint.

446
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:44,872
- So in a certain light, you might find it a little off.
- A little off?

447
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,440
Let me get inside
and start her up for you.

448
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:51,612

Who hasn't considered a pre-circuit
at some point in your life.

455
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,016
[car honking]

456
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,585
I suppose what kept me away
was thinking about

457
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,890
those guys in those layers of heavy
cloaks in the middle of the summer time.

458
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,995
So that's the reason you didn't
go to the seminary. The clothes?

459
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:44,397
Well, that and the,
uh, celibacy issue.

460
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,600
That stuff's stuff
what those guys do.

461
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:49,436
But don't do. [chuckles]

462
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:53,741
Do you mind if I ask you what you did
before you were writing full time?

463
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:59,146
Just working for my father
reluctantly.

464
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:00,480
Doing what?

465
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:05,753
Franchise operations consultant
was my formal title.

466
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:08,555
Uncle Pete's Frozen Custard.

467
00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:11,591
He's the CEO. He's Uncle Pete.

468
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:15,997
He was grooming me to take over the whole
company eventually, but I couldn't stand it,

469
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:19,566
traveling all over the country
in a shitty suit and tie,

470
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,136
dropping in on franchises
and shitty strip malls,

471
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:25,873
making sure they're displaying all
their shitty promotional material.

472
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:29,210
It just... I don't know, the whole
thing depressed the shit out of me.

473
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:31,411
It made me physically ill.
Seriously.

474
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:34,649
Anyway, he fired me.
Then a bunch of other bad stuff happened,

475
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:37,985
with my girlfriend dumping me
and even more bad stuff, so...

476
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:39,887
[sighs]

477
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,823
...I hate him
and we'll never speak again.

478
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:46,894
I hated him before he fired me actually,
hated him long before I even worked for him

479
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,663
which is why
I was reluctant to...

480
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:52,432
Why did you stop?

481
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:59,472
I... I... I was eating
Uncle Pete's frozen custard

482
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,842
the night of the accident
just before I hit you.

483
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:06,180
I was eating Uncle Pete's frozen custard,
and it's like my favorite ice cream.

484
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,950
It's everybody's
favorite ice cream.

485
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:11,252
Why do you think they have
almost 2000 locations?

486
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:14,587
It's actually not ice cream.
It's custard. There's a difference.

487
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:18,225
Custard contains pasteurized egg yolks,
which gives it its creamy finish,

488
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:20,828
- and the machine used...
- Does it not seem strange to you?

489
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:26,000
No, I mean... not really, no.

[jazz music playing on radio]

491
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:30,604
I...

492
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,044
Why do you hate him?

493
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,188
That stuff is delicious, man.

494
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,634
I want to show you something.

495
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:07,274
[Sam whispers]
Who is he?

496
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:10,077
This is my father.

497
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:14,915
Yes, indeed.

498
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:19,220
This old cocksucker
is my dear old dad.

499
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,323
Can he hear us?

500
00:40:22,356 --> 00:40:24,658
Can't hear a goddamn thing.
Can you, pops?

501
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:28,595
This isn't right.

502
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,699
Exactly. Exactly.

503
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:36,070
Listen, I don't know
the pertinence on the decline

504
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,773
of your relationship with your
father, and I'm not asking.

505
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:41,876
I just want to let you know that you
can talk to me about anything any time,

506
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:44,645
and there will never be
any judgment. Understood?

507
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:49,150
As far as
this old bag of bones...

508
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,485
...I hate him too.

509
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,921
I just wish
he could hear me say that.

510
00:40:58,793 --> 00:41:00,795
Sometimes family
isn't family at all.

511
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:05,833
Hey, why don't you, uh,
wait in the car?

512
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,234
- I'll be right down, okay?
- Sure.

513
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:11,138
- Hey, brother.
- What's up, Floyd?

514
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:13,040
- Thanks for the help.
- Yeah, my pleasure.

515
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,810
- Here's 20.
- Oh, you, uh, said 50.

516
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:18,079
- Did I?
- Yeah.

517
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,980
Okay.

518
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:22,616
Of course I thought
it was his real father.

519
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,219
I had no reason to believe
otherwise. And...

520
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:29,924
...he got so emotional.

521
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:34,028
I felt for him.

522
00:41:35,863 --> 00:41:37,298
And I knew he felt for me.

523
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:40,067
He was coming from a good place.

524
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:45,106
[man] And he hadn't told you
yet what he did for a living?

525
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,076
[sighs]

526
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,945
He said he was semi-retired,

527
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,614
that he was working
for Grand Bath Martlin.

528
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:55,716
<i>The government contractor.</i>

529
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:58,986
[heavy metal playing]

530
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:03,991
Hey, what for the hell
are you doing?

531
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,659
- Do it!
- [Floyd] No, don't do it.

532
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:07,128
- [bangs]
- Do it!

533
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:08,362
[Sam groans]

534
00:42:09,497 --> 00:42:11,699
- [Floyd] Are you fucking kidding me?
- [music stops]

535
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,901
You got to go to a hospital
to take that thing off.

536
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,871
I am not going
to that hospital again.

537
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,973
- Ever.
- Oh, it stinks.

538
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:23,410
- Why aren't you at school?
- Sick.

539
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,012
[coughs]

540
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:27,915
I got to go to work.

541
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:29,717
Put an ace bandage on that thing
or something.

542
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:32,853
- Ridiculous.
- Oh, it's so...

543
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:34,655
- ...weak.
- [door closes]

544
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:36,824
And pale.

545
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:39,927
[classical music]

546
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:05,019
[music stops]

547
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:06,287
Don't you agree?

548
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:12,393
Uh, yeah. Uh, completely.
Absolutely.

549
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:17,064
It's not like I want to be a
librarian, but I'm just there.

550
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:18,866
Until I sort things out.

551
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:23,204
Plus... I love being
surrounded by books.

552
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:27,141
- Who wouldn't?
- Alright.

553
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:29,910
You are all set back.

554
00:43:30,844 --> 00:43:31,745
There you go.

555
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,215
Fantastic.

556
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:35,883
Thank you, Lily.

557
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,318
Hey, uh,

558
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:39,453
- you could always be a nurse.
- [chuckles]

559
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:42,323
Fantastic.

560
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,158
Thank you, Lily.

561
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,895
- Uh, you can always be a nurse.
- [chuckles]

562
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:53,400
Are you ok... Are you okay?
What's wrong?

563
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:57,371
Did I... [groans]

564
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:05,012
Did I just thank you twice in
a row like exactly the same way?

565
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:09,416
No. No, just once.

566
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:11,518
Very nicely.

567
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:16,190
I'm sorry. It's just...

568
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:21,528
[sighs] Still getting
my wits about me.

569
00:44:22,563 --> 00:44:23,464
Yeah, it's okay.

570
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:26,133
You're doing great.

571
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:33,440
Do you need anything
before I go?

572
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:41,448
Well, I am heading
to the library.

573
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:42,383
I'll see you later.

574
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:58,399
- [player clicks]
- [Sam] <i>What made you join the military?</i>

575
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,167
[Floyd]
<i>Oh, I was recruited.</i>

576
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:04,204
<i>The marines, they were
starting a new clandestine unit.</i>

577
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:06,073
<i>Very small. Very secret.</i>

578
00:45:07,742 --> 00:45:11,378
<i>And they needed, uh, ten men total,
ten men in the whole country.</i>

579
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:15,015
<i>So they, uh, they went
searching coast to coast.</i>

580
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,850
<i>Wrangled up
about 100 candidates,</i>

581
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:21,155
<i>and sent us up, uh,
it was up north to Alaska.</i>

582
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:24,024
<i>Nine months of torture.
Pure torture.</i>

583
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:27,194
<i>It makes the SEALs look like
nap time at a nursery school.</i>

584
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:31,031
<i>I really don't know how
I survived it, in fact, uh,</i>

585
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,300
<i>there was a few
recruits that I know...</i>

586
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:35,369
[sighs]

587
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,471
<i>Sorry.</i>

588
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,042
<i>Uh, there was, uh,
a few young men who died</i>

589
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:45,045
<i>the first week there on the
Younger York Island.</i>

590
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:49,416
<i>Anyhow, the last ten
bastards standing</i>

591
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,486
<i>all happened to be Ivy Leaguers
with backgrounds of science.</i>

592
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,289
<i>And it was mostly plastics.</i>

593
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:57,891
[Sam]
<i>Plastics?</i>

594
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,929
<i>And is that... is that the work
you do now? Uh, plastics?</i>

595
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:04,398
[Floyd]
<i>Yes. So... some plastics.</i>

596
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:09,970
<i>Some of the work is also with,
uh, lenses. Lenses and lasers.</i>

597
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:13,040
[Sam]
<i>Wow.</i>

598
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:17,010
[Floyd] <i>Yeah. It's a...
Yeah, it's amazing stuff.</i>

599
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,048
Hey, maestro. Here you go.

600
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:22,983
Find your Beethoven right here.

601
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:27,388
Personally, not a fan, but I got
you some other stuff too.

602
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:30,357
That musty, old garage down
there, full of treasures.

603
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:31,659
By the way,
do you play table tennis?

604
00:46:33,193 --> 00:46:34,261
Ping pong?

605
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,664
No, not ping pong, table tennis.

606
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:39,266
Ping pong is like
the "N" word in our sport.

607
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:40,234
Table tennis.

608
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:43,003
Now that you've shed
that plaster cast,

609
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:46,507
perhaps me and you can, uh,
partake in a little game.

610
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,343
- When you're ready.
- Yeah, sure.

611
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:50,511
Maybe sometime.

612
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:52,479
Okay.

613
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:56,483
- "Natural Sounds of Earth"?
- Oh, yeah,

614
00:46:56,517 --> 00:46:59,353
I picked that out for you because I
know you need to relax a little bit.

615
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:01,488
This is especially good
when you're having a rough day.

616
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:05,025
You just sit back and close your eyes.
You breathe through it. [inhales]

617
00:47:05,058 --> 00:47:05,993
Personally,
it's helped me a lot.

618
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:07,027
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

619
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:08,262
I'll check it out.

620
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:11,699
So, how is this coming?

621
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:18,972
Oh, I, um, uh, I... I haven't really
committed much to the page yet.

622
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:21,008
I'm s... still
in my discovery face.

623
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,976
No, I can see that.
There's no pressure.

624
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:25,479
It'll come.

625
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:28,650
And I've got the general
direction mapped out.

626
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:30,551
There's um, uh,

627
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:34,455
so, I mean, yeah, I'm...
I'm... I'm... I'm feeling re...

628
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,624
I'm feeling pretty good
about it, actually.

629
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:38,626
Okay, well,

630
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,730
that reminds me, I got here $350,
it's all I got on me right now.

631
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:45,332
- Put the rest on my tab.
- Tab?

632
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,537
- Floyd, it's $300.
- That's $350 there.

633
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:54,174
- It's $300.
- Okay, my bad. $300.

634
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,376
Put the rest on my tab.
I'll get it to you, like, uh,

635
00:47:57,277 --> 00:48:00,047
Friday, Saturday, but soon,
I'll get it to you soon.

636
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,483
It's fine, whenever.
I know you're good for it.

637
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:10,725
[waves lapping]

638
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:36,283
[sounds intensify]

00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:42,456
[jazz music]

640
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:06,313
- Hey, is this the kid?
- This is him.

641
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:09,516
Did you know, you just can't waltz
into the arena and start bullfighting.

642
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,654
Believe me, I've tried twice.
It's a blood sport we are talking about.

643
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:15,088
- Mr. Floyd.
- Hey, Sonny, what it be?

644
00:49:15,757 --> 00:49:16,724
What are we doing here?

645
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:17,725
I'm taking you to lunch.

646
00:49:18,325 --> 00:49:19,226
Oh.

647
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,330
[music continues]

648
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:48,355
[music continues]

649
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,478
- Mm.
- [sips]

650
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:14,616
Mm.

651
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:21,588
Look at this. "Beans' big
buckets do it again."

652
00:50:22,556 --> 00:50:25,893
This hulking mass of pure fury
is Lentil Beans Washington.

653
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:28,863
One of the best basketball
players in the country.

654
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:31,431
He plays for Eddie's school
at St. Jerry's.

655
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:38,640
[instrumental music]

656
00:50:40,273 --> 00:50:41,174
[flicks]

657
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,450
High school basketball
is a very big deal around here.

658
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:51,585
Very big deal.

659
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:53,387
You a basketball fan?

660
00:50:53,921 --> 00:50:55,188
Yeah, sure.

661
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:57,257
- Pros.
- Pros.

662
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,359
There's no purity
in professional basketball.

663
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:01,528
It's barely any in college.
High school basketball

664
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:02,930
is where the game
is really played.

665
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:04,666
At its essence.

666
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:06,968
- Let's check it out.
- [door opens]

667
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:08,670
[instrumental music]

668
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:11,405
Boy's made out of metal,
he's a goddamn machine.

669
00:51:11,438 --> 00:51:14,909
- How old is that fucking guy?
- Old enough.

670
00:51:18,012 --> 00:51:18,913
Sit down.

671
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:22,684
Atta boy, Beans. Atta boy!

672
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:26,219
[whistle blows]

673
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:29,691
What the fuck do you think
you're doing in here?

674
00:51:29,957 --> 00:51:31,926
This is a close practice,
you jagoff.

675
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:34,194
It's also
a Catholic school, Greg,

676
00:51:34,629 --> 00:51:36,530
one that I pay an exorbitant
amount of tuition for

677
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:38,666
I might add, Jagoff.

678
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:41,435
Get the fuck out of here, Floyd.

679
00:51:41,468 --> 00:51:42,770
You fucking jackass.

680
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,806
Door's that way.

681
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:46,573
Sit down.

682
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,343
- Fucker!
- Hey!

683
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:54,749
We're leaving.

684
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:02,589
Hey, Beans...

685
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:08,295
Hey, Greg,
say hi to your wife from me.

686
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,698
- Woo!
- [Sam laughing]

687
00:52:10,732 --> 00:52:13,668
Come on. Let's go.

- His wife,

690
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,483
she goosed me
at a fundraiser last October,

691
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:30,718
and he saw the whole thing.

692
00:52:31,384 --> 00:52:33,654
- [Sam laughing]
- I hit him low!

693
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:36,590
- [Sam hyperventilating]
- Okay. Put your arms up.

694
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:39,627
Put your arms up, breathe,

Hey, hey. You alright, pal?

Tell me you're OK.

697
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:56,510
[Sam] Must have gotten light headed from...
from running.

698
00:52:57,577 --> 00:52:58,478
Jokes.

699
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:01,749
Yeah. Okay, come on.

700
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,851
Give me a hand. Let me,
let me get you up.

701
00:53:04,118 --> 00:53:05,418
Let me get you to the car.

702
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:08,522
It's fine. I'm fine.

703
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:10,524
- I promise.
- [Floyd] You sure?

704
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:17,665
Yes. Are you kidding me?
[pants] Totally.

705
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,768
[Floyd]
Okay, if you're sure.

706
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:33,547
Hey, listen, uh, I think Eddie has
a detention again today and, uh...

707
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:36,583
He might be getting out soon.
So we're gonna wait around

708
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:39,452
- and give him a ride home, okay?
- Of course. [pants]

709
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:40,955
Is there any orange juice?

710
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:43,291
Yeah, I'll see what I can find.

711
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:45,893
I'm gonna get some fresh air.
I'm feeling a little damp myself.

[Sam] <i>Edward did have
detention again that day</i>

00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:56,971
<i>as he would the next day,</i>

716
00:53:57,672 --> 00:54:00,708

and many more after that.</i>

717
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:05,512

that Floyd was waiting for.</i>

718
00:54:07,114 --> 00:54:08,683

Hello, stranger.

722
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,970
Santa?

723
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:32,940
Is... is that you?

724
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,910
No, little boy. It's not Santa.

725
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,945
But I have something for you.

726
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:40,380
Have you been a good,
little boy?

Are you...

00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:55,096
...really in here right now?

731
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:58,032
I don't know.

732
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:01,501
Why don't you
touch me and find out?

733
00:55:08,876 --> 00:55:10,011
[gasps]

734
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:12,713

[indistinct]

736
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:16,183
- Do you want me to touch you?
- Uh-huh.

737
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:18,619
- On your penis?
- Yeah.

738
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:21,689
No. Oh my God.

739
00:55:21,722 --> 00:55:23,523
What are you doing? What am
I doing? No, this can't...

740
00:55:23,556 --> 00:55:25,525
Relax. It's okay.

741
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,964
Hey, no, wait. You...
you are married to... to Floyd.

742
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:33,167
And what... Floyd... No.
He's like...

743
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:37,104
He's... he's, like, becoming
like... like a father to me now.

744
00:55:37,138 --> 00:55:38,172
Kind of.

745
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:41,842
He ran you over with his car.

746
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,914
Yeah, but he didn't, like,
he didn't, like, run me over.

747
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:49,549
- I flew over. It wasn't...
- He won't care.

748
00:55:49,984 --> 00:55:51,018
And he won't know.

749
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:53,721
We can be quiet and quick.

750
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:55,656
I don't mind.

751
00:55:57,725 --> 00:55:59,492
Hey... he... I'm sorry.

752
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:00,895
I... I... Please, I can't.

753
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:02,830
It's Lily, isn't it?

754
00:56:03,297 --> 00:56:05,933
What? No. Lily?

755
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:08,703
- You kidding me? Ew.
- You want to fuck her I know.

756
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:12,773
Look, I love her.

757
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:14,909
Like my own daughter. I do.

758
00:56:15,977 --> 00:56:21,182
But that girl is a little
fucking coke whore with deep,

759
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,617
dark, deep emotional problems.

760
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:26,787
I'm just putting that out there.

761
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:28,089
Okay.

762
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:30,191
[sighs] I'm sorry.

763
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:32,559
Okay.

I... I like your robe.

768
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:48,609

For Christmas.

I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

<i>...watching myself die...</i>

839
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:13,120

841
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:23,397
<i>...if the place was haunted...
or if it was me.</i>

842

He said he had some background
in parapsychology.

843
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:34,274
"More than just armchair,"
is how he put it.

844
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:36,276
Wanted to give me some tests.

01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:39,213
[psychiatrist]
What kind of tests?

846
01:04:40,113 --> 01:04:45,319
Uh, there were shapes, uh,
geometric shapes.

847
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:50,991
Uh, just drawings of animals.

848
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:55,295
Is it a llama?

849
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:56,731
No, but close.

850
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:58,666
It's not a llama,
it's an alpaca.

851
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:01,401
Very similar, but not the same.

852
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:07,675
- It's a penny.
- It's not just any penny.

853
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:12,179
This little fellow,
he was minted in 1909.

854
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:15,549
It's worth a couple thousands bucks.
In perfect condition.

855
01:05:16,818 --> 01:05:20,320
And it was in perfect condition until
my Lily painted this heart on it.

856
01:05:21,522 --> 01:05:24,258
She was a little girl.
She thought that would make me happy.

857
01:05:25,627 --> 01:05:27,427
Now, it's technically worthless.

858
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:32,165
But it's priceless to me.

859
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:36,336
I'm gonna ask you
to do something.

860
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:38,606
When I give you the go ahead.

861
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:40,808
I want you to close your eyes.

862
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:42,376
I want you
to take a deep breath.

863
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:47,514
And I want you to count down
from six to zero.

864
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:53,688
And when you open your eyes,
you're gonna focus on this penny.

1038
01:16:46,173 --> 01:16:47,074
Count it.

1039
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:52,746
That should take care of my tab.

1040
01:16:56,483 --> 01:16:59,787
- There's an extra 100.
- Performance bonus.

1041
01:17:00,854 --> 01:17:04,058
I'm gonna take you to dinner in the city.
I got this great, little Italian joint.

1042
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:05,426
I want you to meet somebody.

- How are you, my love?
- Good.

1048
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:45,592
Good.

1049
01:18:46,661 --> 01:18:49,596
Samuel, this is Kimmi Hamasaki,
my acupuncturist.

1050
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:51,098
Best in the city.

1051
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:54,902
This is Samuel, my biographer.

1052
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:56,403
The young man I hit with my car.

1053
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,873
Uh... uh, wow, um.

1054
01:19:00,974 --> 01:19:03,277
It's a...
It's so nice to meet you.

1055
01:19:04,545 --> 01:19:07,114
Floyd told me so much about you.

1056

[glasses clinking]

1057
01:19:16,523 --> 01:19:20,327
She is also an expert in shiatsu

1058

- and other forms of...
- Eastern massage.

1059
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:27,368
That's right, Eastern massage.
That's what we like to call it.

1060
01:19:27,401 --> 01:19:28,636
[coughs] Oh.

1061
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:34,274
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

1062
01:19:35,209 --> 01:19:37,211
- I'm going to [unintelligible].
- Mm-hmm.

1063
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:39,480
Hurry back.

1064
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:46,387
Mm.

1065
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:52,192
- She's something.
- Yeah, definitely something.

1066
01:19:52,559 --> 01:19:54,328
Floyd, what exactly is she?

1067
01:19:54,696 --> 01:19:57,331
- You didn't get her for me?
- I'm in love with her, pal.

1068
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:00,167
Got it really bad.

1069
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,506
I'm gonna say something to you
off the record.

1070
01:20:07,408 --> 01:20:10,277
Me and Jacqueline, it's not
really working right now.

1071
01:20:10,745 --> 01:20:12,479
The waters are choppy,
you understand?

1072
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:16,984
Listen, relationships
are strange.

1073
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:19,920
It's like an enigma.
Women are an enigma.

1074
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:22,089
No, women are more
like a riddle.

1075
01:20:23,123 --> 01:20:26,326
The whole goddamn
thing is a... is a conundrum.

1076
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,261
That's what it is.

1077
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:29,631
A man, he has to eat, right?

1078
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:33,567
And when there's no food at home,
he's got to go out for dinner.

1079
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:42,376
Personally I don't like
their cars very much.

1080
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:44,077
But the Japanese people...

1081
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:49,116
...they have this relentless pursuit
for absolute perfection in everything.

1082
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:53,086
I mean, and the women... [sighs]
I'm telling you, man,

1083
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,221
it's like...

1084
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:57,057
What a culture.

1085
01:20:58,091 --> 01:20:59,293
[whispers] Yeah.

1086
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:02,463
How's the mac and cheese?

1087

[opera music]

1088
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:11,706
So I said, "Honey, you can't make peanut butter
cookies without a little peanut butter."

1089
01:21:13,474 --> 01:21:14,541
Oh, here you go.

1090
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:20,147
Who the fuck
is this little fruit?

1091
01:21:21,515 --> 01:21:22,617
This is Bobby.

1092
01:21:23,885 --> 01:21:26,987
- This is the assistant tennis pro?
- Try paralegal, dude.

1093
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:29,523
- Dude?
- Yeah, dude.

1094
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:31,258
- [chuckles]
- [man mocks chuckle]

1095
01:21:32,459 --> 01:21:34,696
- Look who has a sense of humor.
- What the fuck, man?

1096
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:38,599
- I'll fucking sue your ass. I work at a law firm, fuck face.
- [Floyd chuckling]

1097
01:21:38,633 --> 01:21:40,735
Bobby, I would like you
to meet my husband, Floyd.

1098
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:44,004
Oh, and his female friend
from the "Rub and tug."

1099
01:21:44,606 --> 01:21:46,808
- What's your name, sweetie?
- I am Kimmi.

1100
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:47,742
I'm sorry.

1101
01:21:49,142 --> 01:21:50,544
And this is Samuel.

1102
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:52,279
My husband's victim
in a vehicular assault

1103
01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:54,248
which resulted
in a traumatic brain injury.

1104
01:21:54,682 --> 01:21:56,149
What's up?

1105
01:21:57,451 --> 01:22:00,187
Well, it was nice
seeing all of you.

1106
01:22:01,188 --> 01:22:02,089
Night, night.

1107
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,193
Hey, Bobby boy.

1108
01:22:08,395 --> 01:22:09,429
Forgot your purse.

1109
01:22:10,597 --> 01:22:11,699
Here you go.

1110

Fuck!

1113
01:22:20,608 --> 01:22:22,509
- [Floyd] Come on, baby.
- My papers...

1114
01:22:22,543 --> 01:22:24,344
[Jacqueline]
What papers? Leave them!

1115

[opera music]

1119
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:55,502
I'd like to apologize.

1120
01:23:58,405 --> 01:24:00,742
I yelled at you
when I was going crazy.

1121
01:24:01,776 --> 01:24:03,243
You were just concerned.

1122
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:05,178
You didn't deserve it.

1123
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,849
I'm sure I frightened you.

1124
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:11,551
I know you're mad at me.

1125
01:24:14,622 --> 01:24:16,156
[whispers] You're really
very sweet.

1126
01:24:17,959 --> 01:24:20,193
I... I can't stop thinking
about it.

1127
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:21,696
I feel terrible, so...

1128
01:24:27,467 --> 01:24:28,402
[sighs]

1129
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:32,640
Uh, will you... will you please
forgive me?

1130
01:24:35,877 --> 01:24:37,444
It's... it's fake.

1131
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:40,380
It's silk.

1132
01:24:41,548 --> 01:24:43,517
It's real. It's just silk.

1133
01:24:47,254 --> 01:24:48,588
Smells like a real rose.

1134
01:24:48,623 --> 01:24:50,992
Yeah, they must spray them
or I don't know.

1135
01:24:51,025 --> 01:24:53,393
I would... I...
I wouldn't get too close.

1136
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:55,630
- Might give you a rash or something.
- [chuckling]

1137
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,371
[chuckles]

1138
01:25:05,707 --> 01:25:09,276
Thank you for my smelly,
little rose.

1139
01:25:11,713 --> 01:25:13,313
And thank you for apologizing.

1140
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:15,950
So...

1141
01:25:17,685 --> 01:25:18,953
...you forgive me?

1142
01:25:27,394 --> 01:25:29,797
- Cool.
- [both chuckling]

1143
01:25:31,899 --> 01:25:34,635
[Sam] <i>Floyd found it to be a
terribly haunting coincidence</i>

1144
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:36,904

of our accident</i>

it to me several times during my stay,</i>

there must be a connection.</i>

Excuse me a moment, sir.

01:26:16,978 --> 01:26:18,378
Lentil Washington, I presume?

1157
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:22,850
We've been following your career
for quite some time, Mr. Washington.

1158
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,486
You an agent or somethin' like
that?

Something like that.

1160

The man I work for is incredibly
wealthy, very powerful,

1161

and he's taken
a great interest in you.

He request your audience this
evening if you'd be so inclined.

1163
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:40,902
- Of course.
- Yeah, why not?

1164
01:26:41,636 --> 01:26:44,672
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to ask your
friend to stay behind this evening.

Yeah, I'll accept the call.

Hey, hey, hold... slow down.

1173
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,162
I can't understand a word
you're saying, you know,

1174
01:27:41,195 --> 01:27:42,930
you're crying, the tears
and all that.

1175
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:44,999
Who fucked you up?

1176
01:27:46,533 --> 01:27:49,402
What... What do you mean you don't know
what happened? Wha... What happened?

1177
01:27:50,872 --> 01:27:52,539
You were at Uncle Pete's
custard?

01:27:52,572 --> 01:27:54,008
Tha... That's a delicious
custard.

1179

You know, my biographer, he's,
uh, his father was the one...

1180

Okay. Yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

1181
01:27:58,679 --> 01:27:59,680
Tell me what happened.

1182
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:03,583
They took you... Where did they
take you for a ride?

1183
01:28:04,551 --> 01:28:05,786
They put a sack on your head?

1184
01:28:07,622 --> 01:28:09,023
What kind of shot
did they give you?

1185
01:28:10,157 --> 01:28:11,792
What do you mean
you don't remember?

1186
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:15,696
You started talking.
Okay, listen, Beans.

1187
01:28:16,163 --> 01:28:17,765
Listen to me very carefully.

1188
01:28:17,798 --> 01:28:19,499
Did you mention my name?

1189
01:28:21,302 --> 01:28:23,905
What do you mean you don't know? You either
mentioned my name or you didn't mention my name.

1190
01:28:25,706 --> 01:28:27,975
Well, what do you know?
Tell me wha... what you remember?

1191
01:28:29,509 --> 01:28:31,612
So, you're all bruised up.
The bruises go away quickly.

1192
01:28:31,646 --> 01:28:34,715
Just have to get some rest, okay?
Just go home and get some rest.

Oh, racist bastards.

1195
01:28:41,756 --> 01:28:44,759
Okay, listen to me. You gotta
get some clothes or a top or...

1196
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:45,927
or put a hat on that thing.

hanging on behind me.</i>

1206
01:29:13,688 --> 01:29:16,223
<i>I knew right then and there,
he was gonna loose both hands.</i>

1207
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:21,662
<i>So I took out my serrated knife
and held his head in my hand.</i>

1208
01:29:21,696 --> 01:29:22,363
Hey.

1209
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,865
- What the fuck?
- [player clicks]

1210
01:29:27,201 --> 01:29:28,736
I hadn't heard that one.

1211
01:29:30,071 --> 01:29:31,906
I'm sure he'll tell you
himself someday.

1212
01:29:33,674 --> 01:29:34,675
Doubt it.

1213
01:29:40,815 --> 01:29:44,218
[slow jazz music]

1214
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:07,975
[music continues]

1215
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:23,891
...there's a note on my locker.

1216
01:30:24,225 --> 01:30:26,660
I mean, how passive egregious
can you be?

1217
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:29,130
Right? Then, Murph accuses me
of stealing his comb.

1218
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:30,898
I mean, why would I steal
his comb?

1219
01:30:30,931 --> 01:30:32,266
I got my own damn comb
right here.

1220
01:30:34,335 --> 01:30:36,103
[laughing]

1221
01:30:36,737 --> 01:30:38,139
You feeling all right, Floyd?

1222
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:40,041
You seem like you're not
feeling, uh...

1223
01:30:40,941 --> 01:30:42,309
Well, you're not
feeling alright.

1224
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:47,214
Had a meatball hoagie for lunch.
[clears throat]

1225
01:30:47,248 --> 01:30:50,651
Went sour on me.
I might have to shed a tear.

1226
01:30:51,986 --> 01:30:54,622
Let it out. That's me here.

1227
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:58,659
[cart whirring]

1228
01:30:58,692 --> 01:30:59,960
Thanks for the lift, Floyd.

1229
01:31:01,762 --> 01:31:04,799
[slow jazz music]

1230
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:17,344
[woman] So,
he was named after his mother.

1231
01:31:17,378 --> 01:31:19,146
Uh, yes, Florence.

1232
01:31:19,947 --> 01:31:22,650
But he had gone by
Floyd since he was very young.

1233
01:31:22,683 --> 01:31:24,085
- For obvious reasons.
- Hmm.

1234
01:31:24,652 --> 01:31:26,654
- Children can be so cruel.
- Hmm.

1235
01:31:28,022 --> 01:31:31,992
And you weren't aware
of any of his other aliases?

1236
01:31:32,026 --> 01:31:36,197
No, I wasn't aware of any of that, uh...
that side of things, uh...

1237
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:40,034
Until the afternoon
that we met Anselm

1238
01:31:43,104 --> 01:31:45,973
- [engine starts]
- You know what the word "chaos" means?

1239
01:31:47,241 --> 01:31:49,143
- "Chaos?"
- I have an idea.

1240
01:31:49,176 --> 01:31:54,014
Yeah, it's, uh,
total lack of order? Mayhem?

1241
01:31:54,448 --> 01:31:58,319
Yeah, uh, but it's also the stuff that
existed before the universe was born.

1242
01:31:59,353 --> 01:32:03,090
The Ancient Greeks, they thought
that we all came from chaos.

1243
01:32:03,124 --> 01:32:04,058
[shouts] Floyd!

1244
01:32:04,091 --> 01:32:05,926
[wheels squeaking]

1245
01:32:07,328 --> 01:32:08,229
Who the fuck is that?

1246
01:32:10,297 --> 01:32:11,332
[door opens]

1247
01:32:13,934 --> 01:32:14,835
[door closes]

1248
01:32:15,936 --> 01:32:20,741
[dramatic classical music]

1249
01:32:27,815 --> 01:32:29,250
[music intensifies]

1250
01:32:30,619 --> 01:32:33,354
Well, there seems to be, uh,
some sort of, uh... [clears throat]

1251
01:32:33,888 --> 01:32:38,659
...misunderstanding, and I'm prepared
to clear things up by phone anytime.

1252
01:32:40,027 --> 01:32:41,929
- [door opens]
- I'm afraid that won't work.

1253
01:32:42,429 --> 01:32:43,864
Oh, shit.

1254
01:32:48,269 --> 01:32:51,305
Do you mind if I bring my biographer?
He's chronicling my life.

1255
01:32:54,975 --> 01:32:58,045
[jaunty classical music]

1256
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:04,351
Toothpick?

1257
01:33:08,355 --> 01:33:09,857
Are they flavored?

1258
01:33:10,457 --> 01:33:11,325
Fuck's sake.

1259
01:33:12,459 --> 01:33:13,327
Cinnamon.

1260
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:16,830
Nah, sorry, allergic.

1261
01:33:18,933 --> 01:33:22,203
[music continues]

1262
01:33:37,051 --> 01:33:41,055
[music intensifies]

1263
01:34:09,483 --> 01:34:11,986
May I interest
either of you any refreshment?

1264
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:16,991
Yes, I would like a pip Winkelmann.
Heavy on the lemon, easy on the rocks.

1265
01:34:17,024 --> 01:34:18,425
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1266
01:34:18,459 --> 01:34:21,328
- And for you, sir?
- Uh, I do a Falkenhagen

1267
01:34:21,362 --> 01:34:22,329
if you've got one.

1268
01:34:22,363 --> 01:34:23,564
We certainly do.

1269
01:34:23,597 --> 01:34:26,367
[footsteps]

1270
01:34:35,576 --> 01:34:37,811
You're gonna tell me
what the fuck we're doing here?

1271
01:34:40,381 --> 01:34:43,784
[footsteps approaching]

1272
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:03,570
[loud footsteps]

1273
01:35:04,305 --> 01:35:07,341
Gentlemen, thank you so much
for joining us.

1274
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:10,010
Why don't you grab
your beverages and follow me?

1275
01:35:15,549 --> 01:35:17,518
I'm one of Mr. Vogel Vita's
attorneys,

1276
01:35:17,551 --> 01:35:19,219
also his second cousin.

1277
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,889
Did You say, Vogel Vita?

1278
01:35:22,122 --> 01:35:24,058
Any relation to Yan Vogel Vita?

1279
01:35:24,091 --> 01:35:27,494
- The Austro-Bavarian propagandist filmmaker?
- Distant.

1280
01:35:28,295 --> 01:35:29,196
But yes.

1281
01:35:30,431 --> 01:35:32,866
Falkenhagen, it's one
of our beer brands.

1282
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,401
Get out!

1283
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:37,371
Really? We love this stuff.

1284
01:35:37,604 --> 01:35:40,074
Must take a lot of beer
to buy a place like this.

1285
01:35:40,107 --> 01:35:42,509
Aside from the brewery
and import businesses,

1286
01:35:42,543 --> 01:35:45,379
Anselm has interests in a wide
range of corporate concerns.

1287
01:35:45,412 --> 01:35:48,415
The financial sector,
software and technology.

1288
01:35:48,683 --> 01:35:50,117
Ah, speaking of which.

1289
01:35:50,584 --> 01:35:53,387
- Hello, Andre.
- Hello, Charles.

1290
01:35:56,123 --> 01:35:57,191
Follow me.

1291
01:36:01,128 --> 01:36:05,199
[piano playing]

1292
01:36:17,945 --> 01:36:22,015
[piano music continues]

1293
01:36:23,584 --> 01:36:24,518
Oh.

1294
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:27,921
[music intensifies]

1295
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:40,100
- [music ends]
- [applause]

1296
01:36:46,608 --> 01:36:49,644
My little nephew. Louis.

1297
01:36:51,713 --> 01:36:53,580
Anselm, your guests,

1298
01:36:54,548 --> 01:36:57,685
Floyd and his biographer.

1299
01:36:57,719 --> 01:36:59,052
Uh, Samuel.

1300
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:01,989
Your nephew is incredible.

1301
01:37:02,022 --> 01:37:05,325
- I'm a huge Beethoven fan and that...
- Same here, a big fan.

1302
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,163
Terrific fan of Beethoven. Your
nephew, very talented musician.

1303
01:37:09,396 --> 01:37:13,367
And, uh, it was a nice touch with the
wig and the little knickers, I dig it.

1304
01:37:16,437 --> 01:37:17,337
Floyd.

1305
01:37:21,308 --> 01:37:23,243
I've been looking for you.

1306
01:37:24,311 --> 01:37:25,647
Oh, thank you.

1307
01:37:29,516 --> 01:37:32,453
Chin, please. The dossier.

1308
01:37:36,223 --> 01:37:40,360
Fred X. Dennis.
A.k.a Frederick Dobson.

1309
01:37:40,394 --> 01:37:42,429
A.k.a Freddie Pendergrass.

1310
01:37:42,463 --> 01:37:43,997
A.k.a Rick Stops.

1311
01:37:44,264 --> 01:37:47,702
Born Florence
Miguelito Devereaux Gutierrez.

1312
01:37:47,735 --> 01:37:49,503
Presently Floyd.

1313
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:53,006
After dropping out of high school,
spent several fruitless years

1314
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,777
wandering the west Coast
as an aspiring jazz vocalist,

1315
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:58,312
but developed into
a small time con artist,

1316
01:37:58,345 --> 01:38:03,217
- penitentiary marijuana dealer, and occasional gigolo instead.
- Naughty boy.

1317
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,552
[Chin] Over a dozen misdemeanor
arrests that we found,

1318
01:38:05,586 --> 01:38:07,321
and two expunge felonies.

1319
01:38:07,354 --> 01:38:10,157
Currently under investigation
for insurance fraud,

1320
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:12,092
suspected of forgery
and counterfeiting,

1321
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:14,495
arson and public intoxication.

1322
01:38:15,295 --> 01:38:18,532
Previously employed locally by
Febreze auto as a used car salesman.

1323
01:38:18,565 --> 01:38:21,769
Hey, hey! I've never sold used.

1324
01:38:27,541 --> 01:38:29,376
Until he was fired.

1325
01:38:30,912 --> 01:38:35,349
And presently working flex time as a
security guard at Grand Bath Martlin.

1326
01:38:36,483 --> 01:38:37,451
[Sam sighs]

1327
01:38:37,484 --> 01:38:38,552
Is that...

1328
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,055
...more or less
the synopsis of your...

1329
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,759
...biography?

1330
01:38:45,392 --> 01:38:49,196
No, no, it's not,
not at fucking all.

1331
01:38:49,697 --> 01:38:51,031
Can I get another drink?

1332
01:38:51,398 --> 01:38:53,233
[Sam suffocating]

1333
01:39:03,176 --> 01:39:04,679
[inhales]

1334
01:39:19,861 --> 01:39:25,566
Do you know
why we brought you here today?

1335
01:39:28,435 --> 01:39:31,104
[footsteps]

1336
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:47,087
You've stolen from me.

1337
01:39:47,722 --> 01:39:49,256
I steal from you, pal?

1338
01:39:50,892 --> 01:39:51,793
[sighs]

1339
01:39:52,794 --> 01:39:55,395
You see, Floyd.

1340
01:39:56,631 --> 01:40:00,567
Much like you, I quite enjoy
gambling on athletics.

1341
01:40:01,501 --> 01:40:05,105
In particular high school hoops.

1342
01:40:07,609 --> 01:40:14,581
But when I recently lost a significant
speculation on a near certain winner,

1343
01:40:15,182 --> 01:40:20,120
I have decided to do
a little digging for myself.

1344
01:40:23,523 --> 01:40:27,862
You paid Lentil Washington,

1345
01:40:27,895 --> 01:40:31,131
a.k.a Beans...

1346
01:40:32,232 --> 01:40:33,735
...to throw that game

1347
01:40:34,769 --> 01:40:37,705
in order to guarantee
a win for yourself.

1348
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:41,174
A piddling $11,000.

1349
01:40:42,844 --> 01:40:45,145
And your little transgression...

1350
01:40:46,648 --> 01:40:49,784
...caused me to lose.
And I know this all for certain.

1351
01:40:49,817 --> 01:40:51,619
And you know I know this
for certain, don't you?

1352
01:40:54,789 --> 01:40:59,861
I could've went fink on you,
I could've told your bookie...

1353
01:41:01,796 --> 01:41:04,264
...but you'd be dead already,
and that does nothing for me.

1354
01:41:04,297 --> 01:41:05,800
So, this is what we shall do.

1355
01:41:06,968 --> 01:41:11,471
There is a particular politician from
the Congo coming to town in a few weeks.

1356
01:41:11,906 --> 01:41:14,541
He's been giving me a bit of
trouble in his part of the world.

1357
01:41:14,942 --> 01:41:18,980
I will not tire you with the
tedium as it is entirely material.

1358
01:41:19,013 --> 01:41:21,314
But, essentially...

1359
01:41:22,684 --> 01:41:27,421
...I shall need you
to extinguish him.

1360
01:41:29,657 --> 01:41:32,827
Extinguish? As in kill?

1361
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,494
Mm-hmm.

1362
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:39,599
Sorry, pal. I've done a lot of things
in my life, murderer isn't one of them.

1363
01:41:43,738 --> 01:41:44,639
Okay.

1364
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,942
Then you shall pay me
what you owe me,

1365
01:41:47,975 --> 01:41:50,544
plus interest within seven days.

1366
01:41:51,846 --> 01:41:55,883
Or I shall extinguish you.

1367
01:41:57,785 --> 01:41:58,820
How much would that be?

1368
01:42:00,655 --> 01:42:06,994
- $919,756.66.
- That's bullshit.

1369
01:42:07,895 --> 01:42:09,697
How am I supposed
to get that in a week?

1370
01:42:11,331 --> 01:42:15,703
- I don't care, rob a bank.
- [laughs]

1371
01:42:18,673 --> 01:42:22,509
[man laughing hysterically]

1372
01:42:27,982 --> 01:42:31,786
[gun firing]

1373
01:42:32,452 --> 01:42:33,353
[body clatters]

1374
01:42:41,595 --> 01:42:43,530
He was a dreadful attorney.

1375
01:42:43,563 --> 01:42:44,531

1376
01:42:44,564 --> 01:42:46,566
But that fact aside...

1377
01:42:47,434 --> 01:42:48,870
...if I will do that to him,

1378
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:50,705
my own cousin...

1379
01:42:52,807 --> 01:42:58,679
...please know, I will do
the same to you with pleasure.

1380
01:42:59,747 --> 01:43:01,314
Thank you for listening.
Bye-bye.

[Floyd speaking indistinctly]

Oh, and please make sure
Charles is not breathing

1387
01:43:21,636 --> 01:43:23,738
before you dump him. Thank you.

1388
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:26,406
Okay. Where were we?

1389
01:43:27,507 --> 01:43:30,044
You are going to dance for me.

1390
01:43:33,815 --> 01:43:35,850
Okay, guys,
we'll see you next week.

1391
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:39,053
These guys are not that bad.

1392
01:43:39,086 --> 01:43:41,454
I always say, you gotta
kill them with kindness,

1393
01:43:41,488 --> 01:43:43,590
- and they will kill you...

[Sam groans]

1400
01:44:01,642 --> 01:44:04,879
Fucking shit. Piece of shit.

1401
01:44:04,912 --> 01:44:08,582
When the smoke clears, everybody's
lying about something. Everybody.

1402
01:44:08,616 --> 01:44:10,651
You're a sociopath.

1403
01:44:10,685 --> 01:44:12,119
Yeah. Well, I'm not the one
hearing voices.

1404
01:44:12,153 --> 01:44:14,689
[shouts] I said sociopath,
not schizophrenic!

1405
01:44:14,722 --> 01:44:16,958
Whatever. They're both tomatoes.

1406
01:44:17,892 --> 01:44:20,962
- Listen, I'm sorry. I was going to come clean.
- Fuck you, man.

1407
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:22,797
I will put this shit
in the book.

1408
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:23,865
- All of it.
- Do I care?

1409
01:44:23,898 --> 01:44:26,133
Do I care? No, I don't care.

1410
01:44:26,167 --> 01:44:28,703
- Write whatever you want.
- Oh, I will, asshole.

1411
01:44:28,736 --> 01:44:30,071
- Fine, asshole.
- Asshole?

1412
01:44:30,104 --> 01:44:31,571
You're the asshole!

1413
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:35,142
Yeah.

1414
01:44:37,144 --> 01:44:39,714
- Wipe your fucking nose.

1416
01:44:46,053 --> 01:44:46,954
Why?

[ball bouncing]

1418
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:00,735
[Sam] <i>He knew that I
wouldn't trust him anymore.</i>

1419
01:45:01,068 --> 01:45:03,436
<i>That a simple apology
wouldn't suffice.</i>

1420
01:45:04,504 --> 01:45:07,507
<i>So he answered my questions,
filled in the gaps</i>

1421
01:45:07,775 --> 01:45:09,944
<i>and asked only
that I withhold judgment</i>

1422
01:45:10,244 --> 01:45:11,779
<i>just as he would for me.</i>

1423
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:18,451
<i>He told me he needed me
as a friend and he meant it.</i>

1424

- Game!

- Cheers.

[sighs]

1428
01:45:34,835 --> 01:45:35,736
So...

1429
01:45:36,904 --> 01:45:39,941
...what are you gonna do?
Can you mortgage the house?

1430
01:45:39,974 --> 01:45:41,876
No, the house isn't mine.
It belongs to Jackie.

1431
01:45:42,643 --> 01:45:43,744
She has all the cash.

1432
01:45:45,146 --> 01:45:46,981
Can you ask her for...

1433
01:45:48,716 --> 01:45:50,785
[sighs] Right.

1434
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,555
I made my bed but I got a plan.

1435
01:45:55,588 --> 01:45:58,859
I'm going to do what that what's
his name said, I'm gonna rob a bank.

1436
01:45:59,526 --> 01:46:00,560
No, you're not.

1437
01:46:00,593 --> 01:46:01,494
Yeah.

1438
01:46:02,897 --> 01:46:05,967
It's an old chestnut, I know,
but that's why it's going to work.

1439
01:46:06,533 --> 01:46:07,735
Have a good feeling about it.

1440
01:46:08,302 --> 01:46:09,804
Besides, where am I going to get

1441
01:46:10,671 --> 01:46:12,572
close to a million dollars
in less than a week?

1442
01:46:15,109 --> 01:46:16,143
Bank I guess.

1443
01:46:17,244 --> 01:46:18,946
Do you have a gun from work?

1444
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:22,482
No, we use bear spray
and sticks.

1445
01:46:23,884 --> 01:46:24,819
But...

1446
01:46:24,852 --> 01:46:27,755
[light suspenseful music]

1447
01:46:28,222 --> 01:46:30,891
- You're gonna rob a bank with that?
- Mm-hmm.

1448
01:46:32,093 --> 01:46:36,197
It doesn't work. Sitting on the bottom
of a retention pond for over a year.

1449
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:37,898
I don't even have bullets
for it, but...

1450
01:46:38,766 --> 01:46:40,801
...we're gonna have to pull
something in there.

1451
01:46:42,602 --> 01:46:44,138
Not worried about it.
We'll be fine.

1452
01:46:44,872 --> 01:46:46,207
We? What?

1453
01:46:46,774 --> 01:46:47,842
Are you kidding me?

1454
01:46:47,875 --> 01:46:49,310
- No.
- No, no, no.

1455
01:46:49,343 --> 01:46:52,313
I am not robbing
a fucking bank, Floyd!

1456
01:46:52,346 --> 01:46:54,782
- No, no way.
- Of course you're not robbing the bank.

1457
01:46:54,815 --> 01:46:56,183
I would never put you
in harm's way.

1458
01:46:57,051 --> 01:46:58,786
- It's why you're driving.
- Floyd.

1459
01:47:00,788 --> 01:47:01,689
No.

1460
01:47:02,923 --> 01:47:04,125
This is your thing.

1461
01:47:08,262 --> 01:47:09,897
Well, I figured you'd say that.

1462
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:14,101
Suppose I could
drum up somebody else.

1463
01:47:15,002 --> 01:47:18,272
[light suspenseful music]

1464
01:47:27,248 --> 01:47:29,050
Better lay off that flask,
my friend.

1465
01:47:29,316 --> 01:47:30,317
[exhales]

1466
01:47:31,018 --> 01:47:34,088
I'm nervous, I'm about to
rob a damn bank, Floyd.

1467
01:47:34,789 --> 01:47:37,725
I'm robbing the bank, you're driving.
You shouldn't be drinking.

1468
01:47:37,758 --> 01:47:38,993
[sighs]

1469
01:47:41,062 --> 01:47:41,962
Let me have that.

1470
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:47,001
Hmm.

1471
01:47:51,939 --> 01:47:53,174
You got your lipstick on it.

1472
01:47:55,943 --> 01:47:58,112
What are you doing?
Putting lipstick on

1473
01:47:58,145 --> 01:47:59,780
if you're just gonna wear
a damn mask.

1474
01:48:00,948 --> 01:48:02,149
Helps me get into character.

1475
01:48:06,787 --> 01:48:07,855
Oh.

1476
01:48:08,289 --> 01:48:10,057
There's no way
that thing's gonna work.

1477
01:48:11,192 --> 01:48:13,194
- You're right, it doesn't.
- [gunshot]

1478
01:48:14,929 --> 01:48:16,664
- Oh, shit.
- Where'd it go?

1479
01:48:17,398 --> 01:48:18,332
Shit.

1480
01:48:21,102 --> 01:48:22,369
- Is that blood?
- A little bit.

1481
01:48:22,403 --> 01:48:23,838
- Am I bleeding?
- A little bit.

1482
01:48:25,573 --> 01:48:28,843
- Floyd, why am I bleeding?
- Just put a little pressure on that right now and... Here.

1483
01:48:28,876 --> 01:48:30,911
Keep drinking, all right?
Just keep drinking.

1484
01:48:31,178 --> 01:48:32,213
Oh, shit.

1485
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,448
Fuck. And, uh, let me
get organized here.

1486
01:48:34,482 --> 01:48:37,751
I'm just gonna take care of business.
I'm gonna go in and out.

1487
01:48:37,785 --> 01:48:40,855
Five minutes. It will take five minutes.
Here, hold that mirror up.

1488
01:48:40,888 --> 01:48:41,956
I'll be right back.

1489
01:48:42,456 --> 01:48:44,191
Oh, fuck. Where's the mirror?

1490
01:48:44,225 --> 01:48:45,893
Hold it up.
I can't see, goddamn it.

1491
01:48:46,861 --> 01:48:47,761
Stop shaking.

1492
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:51,165
I can't...
I can't see a goddamn thing.

1493
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:52,366
Oh, shit. That looks terrible.

1494
01:48:53,267 --> 01:48:55,836
Oh, shit. Hold it up!
Hold it up!

1495
01:48:56,203 --> 01:48:58,372
Fuck. [panting]

1496
01:48:59,807 --> 01:49:03,144
Okay, all right. Just give me five minutes.
I'll be right back.

1497
01:49:03,177 --> 01:49:04,345
We'll get you stitched up.

1498
01:49:05,312 --> 01:49:06,213
Where's my purse?

1499
01:49:10,084 --> 01:49:11,852
- [door closes]
- Hurry up, Floyd.

1500
01:49:18,325 --> 01:49:19,226
He shot me.

1501
01:49:22,296 --> 01:49:24,965

Where are you going?
Straighten out! Straighten out!

Are you sure?

01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:24,858
All right, losers weepers.

You're smoking?

1535
01:51:58,352 --> 01:52:00,487
[sobs] I bumped it from Eddie.

1536
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:12,066
You know, about a month ago,
Kimmi asked me

1537
01:52:12,099 --> 01:52:14,535
to move with her to Colorado
where her sister lives.

1538
01:52:16,303 --> 01:52:17,871
Kimmi loves the mountains.

1539
01:52:23,911 --> 01:52:25,079
Should've said yes.

1540
01:52:28,382 --> 01:52:29,483
What about your family?

1541
01:52:31,452 --> 01:52:33,087
Eddie's at that age..

1542
01:52:35,122 --> 01:52:36,390
Well, he can't stand me.

1543
01:52:37,191 --> 01:52:39,326
And, uh, Jackie.

1544
01:52:47,534 --> 01:52:48,602
Lily might care.

1545
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:51,305
