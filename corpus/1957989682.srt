1
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,005
- What do you know
about marijuana?

2
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:40,807
What do you think you know?

3
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:44,210
It's come a long way since
dime bags and Cheech and Chong.

4
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:48,113
The starters is becoming a
200 billion dollar industry

5
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,817
as well as the number one
agricultural crop in California.

6
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,118
I'm a dispensary
owner in Los Angeles,

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,954
meaning, I sell weed,

8
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:56,022
and California knows about it.

9
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,026
We don't call it
marijuana anymore, though.

10
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:01,561
It's called flower,

11
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:03,763
like the plant you give
your mother or cannabis.

12
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,368
That's Franco, a working-class
dude just like the rest of us,

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,038
except he grows for one of
the best suppliers in LA.

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,539
- Looks good. - I know.

15
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,909
You'd be bounded too if you saw
the profit margin on this stuff.

16
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,987
The demand was so high I had
to hire delivery drivers.

17
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:29,822
You show ID, you get your weed.

18
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,222
It was that simple.

19
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,357
No longer have to
feel like a schmuck

20
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,593
doing deliveries in my car.

21
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,227
The money was just pouring in.

22
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,031
It was like the wild west and
the heavy one was staking their
claims.

23
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,834
We even called it,
the green rush.

24
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,569
Here's a normal day
buying wholesale.

25
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,771
Flying the Cessna
was my buddy, Cada.

26
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,273
I'd meet him at Santa
Paula Airport at 9 AM

27
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,175
and we could either
go to Humboldt County

28
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,410
or Inland Farm County by 11.

29
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,714
Today, we're going Inland.

30
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:57,449
When I started as a
grower 5 years ago,

31
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,519
I never would have imagined it
would turn out to be something
like this.

32
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,022
Farming technology has
advanced immeasurably,

33
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:04,489
and these Inland growers have
given the folks in Humboldt

34
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,424
a run for their their money.

35
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,629
They're harvesting buttloads
of stuff in the desert.

36
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,831
Think of the sand where
water doesn't exist.

37
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,966
- Man, the crops
are great this year.

38
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,869
- Thank you, this is tricom
production like donkey dicks.

39
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,639
- At noon, I buy a
barrel straight from one

40
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,574
of the friendly local growers,

41
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:24,577
have it packed into a van
and driven down to LA.

42
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,379
Why bother growing it when it's
as easy to get your hands on
this stuff?

43
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,247
You see that plastic bag?

44
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,617
That's 50 pounds of dried bud

45
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,620
and behind me, a 197
barrels full of them.

46
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,990
Street value, $19 million.

47
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,693
You could fit a small body
in one of those barrels.

48
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:43,629
I hop back on a plane,
shoot back to LA,

49
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,264
buy a couple of bags off the
runway just because I could.

50
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,968
And then I'm back in time to
grab a late lunch at Santa
Monica.

51
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,037
I had this down to a science.

52
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,338
Keep in mind, absolutely none
of this was federally legal.

53
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,809
I met this young
kid, Bobby, at court.

54
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,176
He was there for
beating up this guy

55
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,845
who beat up his little sister.

56
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,913
Good kid and he came with
some valuable skills.

57
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,850
Just the kind of guy I needed.

58
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,452
We quickly bonded and after a
few months, he started working
for me.

59
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,891
He also worked in collections.

60
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,191
So I asked him to do the job
they didn't want to do anymore.

61
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,829
On the streets, where
there are no rules,

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,701
it's important people respect
you and pay their debts on time.

63
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,602
I was never a dealer before

64
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,838
and I still don't
consider myself as one.

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,239
It was only after my mother
and me moved out west

66
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,109
that I started growing
vegetables for some sort of
therapy.

67
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:32,111
I was pretty good at it

68
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:34,847
so I stopped picking the weeds
and started growing them.

69
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,117
The money was so good that I
stop growing altogether and just
sold it.

70
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:41,687
No longer that I need a plan
B, this was my only plan.

71
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,190
So how could something
so right go so wrong?

72
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,694
- We want to turn to the
historic night here in
California.

73
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,663
What affects you the most?

74
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,398
- Yeah, voters legalized the
recreational use of marijuana.

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,569
Here's a look at
the Prop 64 results.

76
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,170
- You think weed turning
legal would be a good thing.

77
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,404
Think again.

78
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,873
My sales tank,

79
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,575
my drivers are leaving,

80
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,076
and I can't get a
dispensary license

81
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,879
even though the state
promised thousands of them.

82
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,981
So then, people started telling
me, "Get a loan. Try to stay
afloat."

83
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,683
Not a chance.

84
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:12,417
Cannabis may now be
legal on a state level

85
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,419
but not on the federal level.

86
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,122
Things won't even
give you a lollipop

87
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:17,957
for walking through the front
door and nonetheless a loan.

88
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,557
- Of course, there was
money involved in it.

89
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,825
This is politics.

90
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,359
Politics, pot,
money, okay?

91
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,229
- Then the big shot politicians

92
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,463
add testing regulations

93
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,633
which up all the
prices for everyone.

94
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,002
Look, I get it. California
wants to be legit

95
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,904
and people want safe weed

96
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,338
but the folks growing
your genetically

97
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,207
modified breakfast cereals,

98
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,143
have less red tape to cut
through than my industry.

99
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,946
So I'm forced to pay off these
shady cameras inspectors,

100
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,150
back alleys, just
so I can stay open.

101
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:46,685
Maybe it's time to pull
up the stakes and move on

102
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,419
because the end of the
green rush was within sight.

103
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,411
- I think I need a plan B.

104
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,049
- You just got to get
your swagger back.

105
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,385
- Who said I lost my swagger?

106
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,388
- You got this.

107
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,742
- Someone had an order?

108
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:44,977
- You're the delivery guy?

109
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,280
- Marcus here?

110
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,548
- Yeah. Come in.

111
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,819
- Marcus, the
delivery guy is here.

112
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,572
- I got this, ladies.

113
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,711
- Delivery guy.

114
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:19,912
- You ordered an ounce?

115
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:20,613
- Yes, I did.

116
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,683
- I need a card and ID.

117
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:25,985
- What are you talking about?

118
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,186
- ID, I need to
make sure it's you.

119
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:30,388
- Here we go like the only
company with some shit, man.

120
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,391
- Yeah, I do.

121
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,563
- Fine, yeah. Yeah, my bad.

122
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,698
Hey, Britney!

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,567
Britney, bring my
ID up here. Please.

124
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,638
Girls, man. Right?

125
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,041
- So this place is yours, huh?

126
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:52,045
- Yeah, man. Yeah. Paid
in full. Very sick, huh?

127
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:53,913
Hey, thank you.

128
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,883
Lastly, my card.

129
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,251
- Got it.

130
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,253
-  There's that.

131
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,121
- Alright.   - Appreciate you.

132
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,224
Okay, hold on a minute,
I have a tip for you.

133
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,295
That's balcony for my show
tonight. Come through, man.

134
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:10,529
Good times, bring a
friend. Lots of girls.

135
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,429
- Yeah.

136
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,463
- Bye.

137
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,534
- Let's get high.

138
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,556
- Hey, thanks for meeting up.

139
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:38,624
- You bet.

140
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,092
- Just to be clear,

141
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,961
this is going to cover all
my unregulated products

142
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:44,196
and no bureau coming
by for routine checks.

143
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,031
- Why do you want to ask me
specific shit like that, man?

144
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,333
Makes me feel like
you're tapped.

145
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:48,734
- Are you serious?

146
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,469
- You got the cash? Come here.

147
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,205
- Here.

148
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,443
- Okay. This will
cover you for 6 months.

149
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,912
No regulations will be enforced.

150
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,380
- Yeah, but I can sell
any flower I want.

151
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:03,882
- Yes. Just don't be stupid.

152
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,651
I still have to come
by for inspections.

153
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,252
- But only you, right?

154
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,188
I don't want to have to pay off
any other inspectors, again.

155
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,557
- Only me.

156
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,426
- Hey, what about my
dispensary license?

157
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,995
- What about it?

158
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,096
- When's it going
to get approved?

159
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,166
- You still got your
delivery license, right?

160
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,535
- Yeah, but my business, it
depends on the dispensary
license.

161
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,638
- I don't make the  rules
of the state, buddy.

162
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,906
I just enforce them.

163
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:31,710
Keep applying.

164
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,925
- What's up?

165
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,328
- The AC is broken again, Vince.

166
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,295
- Get off your phone.

167
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,099
- Look, I don't know.

168
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,301
- You had 10. You come back
with 7 and the money for 2?

169
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,803
- It must have gotten lost.

170
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,605
- What is going on?

171
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:00,606
- He lost a bag.

172
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,974
- How big?

173
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,976
- An 8? He's gonna break my arm.

174
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,744
- Okay, Jesus, man. Let him go.

175
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,845
- Are you serious?

176
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,380
- Let him go.

177
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,451
- Cumming, go look in your car.

178
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:13,585
See if you can find it.

179
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:13,919
- He smoked it.
He's not  going to

180
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,187
fucking find it, Vince.

181
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,121
- Just go look.

182
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:17,890
- Thank you, Vince.

183
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,292
- Get the fuck out of here.

184
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,461
- What the fuck?

185
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,098
He's our last driver.

186
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,933
He's probably going
to fucking quit.

187
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,135
- That was his fourth time.

188
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,737
You've got to let these people
know who's running shit.

189
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,571
- The guy's got a
kid, for God's sake.

190
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,705
- That's not my problem.

191
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,940
We are running the
business, right?

192
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:37,810
- Where the fuck
is Samson? He quit?

193
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:39,445
- Yeah, he quit.

194
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:44,283
Hey, look, I love you.
You know this, right?

195
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:46,585
I brought you in here
as my partner to help.

196
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,522
Right now, financially, we're
getting fucking crushed.

197
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:50,889
Okay?

198
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:55,627
Hey, hey, just help us. Okay?

199
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,566
- Fine.

200
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,849
- Oh, dandelions.

201
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:19,685
- Yeah, I feel like
I've never been there.

202
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,487
- Yo, I'm telling you.

203
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:22,821
These regulations are
killing us even with

204
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,390
the help of the Cannabis Bureau.

205
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,560
But I meant these Armenians
that have good quality

206
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:28,694
bud that we can buy.

207
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,196
Cheap.

208
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,663
- That quickly, huh?

209
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:32,931
- I like Armenians.

210
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,767
- And we can sell it for triple.

211
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,003
I'm trying to set up a meeting.

212
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,006
- How long you known these guys?

213
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,875
- Not long.

214
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,409
But they are all over
the street though.

215
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,279
-  I get the feeling you're
gonna set up no matter what.

216
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:48,847
- What the fuck?

217
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,550
- What are you looking at?

218
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:51,884
- I've been looking for this
motherfucker everywhere. Hold
on.

219
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,085
- Is he serious?

220
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,454
- Here's Ricky.

221
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:57,055
- Who's Ricky?

222
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,724
- He's this Junior Agent
with ICM. I'll be back.

223
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:04,730
- You want some?

224
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,733
- I'm good. Enjoy.

225
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:32,958
- Hide this.

226
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,596
I'll text you tomorrow
with the Armenians info.

227
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:38,363
- Really?

228
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:44,637
- That was really
good seeing you again.

229
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,139
- Yeah. Thanks again.

230
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,473
- No problem.

231
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,610
Go ahead and give me a
call. We'll set it up.

232
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:52,077
- I will. Thanks again for
helping. I appreciate it.

233
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:52,878
- No problem. - Okay.

234
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,215
- Hey, baby. - Hey, babe.

235
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,518
What's going on?

236
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,751
- I don't know.

237
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:02,854
- That guy looks
like he's injured.

238
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,023
- Nah, you think so?

239
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,725
- Yeah, we should
probably get out of here.

240
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,926
- That's a very good idea.

241
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:22,841
- So are you going to
meet with those Armenians?

242
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,244
- I don't know. I got
to find out some more

243
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,878
information with these guys.

244
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,213
- I mean you should.

245
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,716
It'd be good for your business.

246
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,418
- Don't worry about my
business. I gotta handle this.

247
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,888
- Okay. I mean I'm just
looking towards the future.

248
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,124
- Me too.

249
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,261
Speaking of, what's up with
Ricky with his suit jacket?

250
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,465
- Ricky, he just wanted to talk
to me, see if I was interested
in a part.

251
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,600
- A part?

252
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,036
- Yeah, he saw my
reel and was curious.

253
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,672
I mean, what is
this, 21 Questions?

254
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:54,273
- No. I'm just curious.

255
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,742
- No, you're not.
You're probing.

256
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,043
- Tab, I'm not probing.
- Yes, you are.

257
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,379
Fuck, Vince.

258
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,248
- Hey, hey. I'm sorry,
alright? I trust you. I-

259
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,252
Things are just crazy right now.

260
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,656
- Yeah, with work?
I mean, I can tell.

261
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,524
It's taken a toll on you
and it's taken a toll on us.

262
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:14,893
- Yeah, I know.

263
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,763
- I don't think you do.

264
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,932
I mean, why don't you let
Bobby take over for a while?

265
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,102
- What? No, no no. I think I've
worked way too hard for this
business.

266
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,707
- You've done it all, baby.

267
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:28,940
There's nothing left to prove.

268
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,713
- Yeah.

269
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:34,813
Come on.

270
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,529
And, by the way.

271
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:50,829
What the fuck was
that the other night?

272
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,698
- At the club?

273
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:53,499
Silas.

274
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,034
He's fine.  I got
him in the arm.

275
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,772
- I thought your
debt was settled?

276
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:02,074
- They are. That's the good
thing about capitalism.

277
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:03,676
You get new ones.

278
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:06,978
What did you do with
the screwdriver?

279
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,447
- I threw it in
the park trash can.

280
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,483
- Nice. - No, not nice.

281
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,287
- Your partner brings me
all kinds of new business.

282
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,023
- Yeah, he's got a unique style.

283
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,761
You want some Armenian coffee?

284
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:23,462
- No, thanks.

285
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:24,630
- It's the strongest thing
you can drink around here.

286
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,375
So, you're looking to
buy some Humboldt  weed?

287
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,578
We can sell you 200 pounds.

288
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,581
We don't really do
anything less than that.

289
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:43,915
- Okay, how much?

290
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,824
- You're looking at about
a hundred thousand dollars.

291
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,795
- I know a lot of
guys up in Humboldt.

292
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:58,196
Who're you getting it from?

293
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:00,932
- Excuse me?

294
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,935
The 200 pounds of
flowers' a lot,

295
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,370
maybe I know the grower.

296
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,510
- It's this hippie
guy by the coast.

297
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:12,110
- A lot of hippie
guys by the coast.

298
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,981
There's no buying any less?

299
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,116
- My friend, this
is a good deal.

300
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,985
We can't sell you this for less.

301
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:21,821
It'll cost us money.

302
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,092
- Yeah, she's a big
chunk of change.

303
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,362
- Well, maybe you're in the
wrong business then? Hmm?

304
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,667
- Nah, I don't think
that's the case.

305
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:37,135
- What's your background?

306
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,672
- Used to be a grower upstate.

307
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:43,576
- Explains your questions.
But what about before that?

308
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,210
- I was a dancer.

309
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:53,084
- I used to fight, box.

310
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,822
- A boxer? Very cool.

311
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:57,355
I love the

312
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,894
barbaric nature of the sport.

313
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,262
I hope you didn't get hit
on the head too many times,

314
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,599
because selling this
will make you five

315
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,601
times as much as what
we are charging you.

316
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,101
- So why don't you
sell it yourself?

317
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,373
- This isn't a negotiation.

318
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,344
And you're starting
to try my patience.

319
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:23,982
- Vince.

320
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,519
You can't do that man. You can't
talk to them dudes like that.

321
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:27,820
- What? I can't ask questions?

322
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:29,689
- Yeah, you can.

323
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,923
But look, they're
giving us non-compliant

324
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,659
weed that can't get sold, right?

325
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,025
So you got the
regulators on our side.

326
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,095
Fortune favors the bold.

327
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:38,497
- Yeah, it does. But

328
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,167
we don't have that
kind of money.

329
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,569
- I can flip a hundred
thousand in a week.

330
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:44,570
We don't have it
in the business?

331
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,204
- No.

332
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,373
Hey.

333
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:50,877
Don't quit your side jobs.

334
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,097
It's all here?

335
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,331
- Just bring the bag back.

336
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,736
-What? -Don't act like you don't
know, alright?

337
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:19,505
The bag. The black bag, no
one ever brings them back.

338
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,007
You know how much I spent
a month on those things?

339
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,108
- Is this really a thing?

340
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,812
- Yeah, it adds up.

341
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:31,049
So, how's business?

342
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,718
- Slowly dying. You?

343
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:37,890
- Less runs, mostly swapping out
a legal flower for regulatory.

344
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:38,824
Crazy how things change, huh?

345
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,293
Guess it's just a
matter of time, right?

346
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,762
- I guess so.

347
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:44,964
- I don't know.

348
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,266
I think I will go
back to growing.

349
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:49,702
Maybe go back East
on my own indoor.

350
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:51,771
- Tabitha would move there?

351
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,906
- No.

352
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:55,407
I'm thinking, you know,

353
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,844
maybe on my own for a while.

354
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,781
Find someone more
stable, less quincy.

355
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,014
- What? Like you?

356
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,952
Go marry that girl, Vince.

357
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,653
If you are thinking of leaving,

358
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,655
I got guys back East
always looking to buy.

359
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:10,556
- Really.   - Yep.

360
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,826
Just let me know.
I'll make the contact.

361
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:15,027
- Yeah, that'll be great.

362
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,699
- Thanks. - Yeah man, you got
it. Oh, wait a minute.

363
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:26,572
Look at this. - I remember this
day. Where'd you

364
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:29,675
find this? - Some old box. It's
the good old days, huh?

365
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:31,176
- Yeah.

366
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,545
- Back when you
could kick my ass.

367
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:34,914
- I could still kick your ass.

368
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,341
- We're shutting down the
business at the end of the
summer.

369
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,343
I ran the numbers.

370
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,078
You sure you can flip
this hundred grand?

371
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,246
- Of course.

372
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,848
I wouldn't have suggested it.

373
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,984
- How well do you
know these guys?

374
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:47,887
- Pretty well. Known them
for like a few weeks.

375
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,956
We have some kind
of relationship now.

376
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,390
- Yeah, we need this deal.

377
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,927
- I know.

378
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:57,997
- Look, I want to
talk to your guy.

379
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:59,632
- My guy?

380
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,167
- The big guy. The
guy you collect for.

381
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,102
- That guy? No, no way.
That's out of the question.

382
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,570
We can't do that, Vince.

383
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,605
- Yeah, I don't see
any more options.

384
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,607
- Listen, Vince. You don't
want to mess with these dudes.

385
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,141
You saw what they had me do.
What'd I do on the old what?

386
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,744
Two Gs?

387
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:12,410
- What other choice do we have?

388
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,413
Let the place go broke?

389
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:15,981
- I mean, it ain't
got to be like that.

390
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:20,520
- But it is. Look, I
work my entire life.

391
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,353
I'm in my 40s and I have
nothing to show for it.

392
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,056
I still live in an apartment.

393
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,390
- Hey, apartments ain't bad.

394
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,292
- Not to you, you're a kid.

395
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,928
Just setup a meeting
with your guy, okay?

396
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:49,280
- This looks awfully suspect.

397
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,649
- You said you wanted to meet.
This is the meeting spot.

398
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:57,056
Fellas.

399
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,996
- I never heard from
you the other day.

400
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,532
- Uh, my phone died.

401
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,033
- I need you to stay
in contact with me.

402
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:11,003
- Understood.

403
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,806
- This is uh-

404
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:18,310
- Vince. And you're here
to borrow some money, ya?

405
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,181
- Yeah. Maybe we can go
talk about this in private?

406
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,051
- You're amongst friends here.

407
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,484
How much are you looking for?

408
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,356
- A hundred thousand.

409
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:32,792
- Hundred thousand
dollars is a lot of money.

410
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,628
- Yeah, I know.

411
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,361
but we're good for it.

412
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:41,868
- But I don't know you.
Him, I unfortunately know.

413
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:45,905
I'm going to need some sort
of reassurance or collateral.

414
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:47,372
Just in case you
can't pay me back.

415
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:49,408
- Then we're good for.

416
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,309
- How much did you
business make last year?

417
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,477
- A quarter of a
million dollars.

418
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,814
- And lately?

419
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:56,481
- Slightly less.

420
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,561
- I don't like to lose Vince.

421
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,497
- We'll get back to you.

422
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:19,238
Bobby.

423
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:24,810
Keep your phone on.

424
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,133
- What the fuck?

425
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:53,772
- I really appreciate
you giving me time.

426
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:55,074
- No problem.

427
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:56,441
That's fine. But you're
paying next time.

428
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,408
- I sure hope so.

429
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,079
- What's going on here?

430
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:00,478
- Oh, hey Ricky was
just telling me by.

431
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,982
- What?

432
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,783
- We went to the showcase
tonight for actors.

433
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:05,618
It was way too far for
me to Uber back, so

434
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,453
he brought me.

435
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:09,989
- I should probably get going.

436
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:11,024
- Yeah, you should.

437
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,362
- I'm sorry, thank
you. I appreciate it.

438
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,368
Seriously? You just
embarrass me like that?

439
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,502
- What're you talking about?

440
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:24,770
- He's trying to get me work.

441
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:26,072
- It's not what he wants.

442
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,306
- If you would look
at your phone like you

443
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:29,976
do for everyone else, you
would see that I text you.

444
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,078
Vince, I know you have
a lot going on, but

445
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,680
I want to feel like
a priority to you.

446
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:35,949
- You are a prio-

447
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,688
- What's going on between us?

448
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,623
- Nothing, we're fine.

449
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,159
- Are we?

450
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,193
- What are you talking about?

451
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,599
- I just- Sometimes I
just... I don't know.

452
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:54,500
I feel like we're
two different people.

453
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,168
- Yeah, we are and that's why

454
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,269
this works.

455
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,173
- I just feel like
it should be more.

456
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:03,042
- Yeah, I agree.

457
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:05,078
Maybe we both want things
that we don't have right now.

458
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:06,779
I'll be upstairs.

459
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:54,727
- Yo, Vince. This is Bobby.
So I talked to the guy,

460
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:56,228
he said he's in. So it's
your call if you still want

461
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,597
to go through with this.
If so, we meet up with

462
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,766
him tomorrow. Let me know.

463
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,749
- The terms are standard. One
week to repay, 15% interest.

464
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:52,684
If you can't pay it back,
you put up collateral.

465
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,320
- What kind of collateral?

466
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:57,323
- Twenty five percent of your
business for the next 10 years.

467
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,059
- To recoup the interest.

468
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:01,160
And I want your license.

469
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:02,295
- My license?

470
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,998
- Your delivery license.
I hear it's worth 50,000.

471
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,069
- Somewhat like 80. You want
me to transfer my license?

472
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:13,173
- Perhaps you feel like
you've been treated unfairly.

473
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,781
- Excuse us for a minute.

474
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,198
- What're you thinking?

475
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,834
- I don't know what
the fuck to think.

476
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,303
They don't have many choices.

477
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:46,306
- You can walk away.

478
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:47,974
-  Fine, go broke?

479
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:50,409
I lose the business If
I can't pay him back.

480
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:52,779
I lose if I don't borrow.
Either way, fucked.

481
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,148
You got the guy that
can move this, right?

482
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,119
- Yeah. We'll get
it back in a week.

483
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:01,121
Rest is ours.

484
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:03,356
What's the problem?

485
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:09,027
Is I see these people living
their lives, you know?

486
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:13,098
Nice family, good
homes, good jobs, 401ks.

487
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,368
Who want that?

488
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,371
Tide walked around a few.

489
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:23,041
Fortune favors the bold, right?

490
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,245
Fuck it. Let's do it.

491
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,346
- Fuck it.

492
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:21,700
- My friends, welcome. I'm
glad you came to your senses.

493
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,305
Is that my money?

494
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:27,340
- Got our flower?

495
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:28,942
- It's in the back
of that truck.

496
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,278
It smells amazing. Telly's
finest. Check it out.

497
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:44,756
200 pounds. If we're a
little off on the weight,

498
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:46,059
you can charge us.

499
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:53,198
-  It's all there?

500
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:58,470
- Whoo! It smells good
as fuck back here, man.

501
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:00,106
-It's good stuff.

502
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:01,873
- It's good shit, bitch.

503
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:13,052
- I'll send someone for the
truck. Don't scratch it.

504
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:15,655
-  You're not going to count it?

505
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:17,222
- I trust you.

506
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:24,130
Con velez.

507
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,292
- We're taking a right,
right here, right?

508
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:54,594
- Alright.

509
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:00,232
- I've been thinking about
what I want to do with

510
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:01,801
the money after we sell, man.

511
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:05,470
- Yeah? What? You
gonna have a party?

512
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,308
-Oh, man. I want to
give it to my sister.

513
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:10,375
- That's kinda new.

514
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:14,012
- Yeah, man. Hey, just
give her an edge, you know?

515
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:15,748
I mean, we can run this game for

516
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,352
a while, but she needs to go
to college, man. They won't

517
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:23,222
be much, but it'll pay
for a semester or two.

518
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,224
- Someone's tagging
along. Head on, Bobby.

519
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:29,294
- This is the right thing to do.

520
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:30,530
But I'm still doing our part.

521
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:32,699
- Sure you are.

522
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,924
- Hey, Franco. Thanks, brother.

523
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:00,293
- No worries, man.

524
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,195
Hey, I got a hot date tonight.
She charges by the hour.

525
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:05,965
- Have fun with that.

526
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:09,035
- Hello.

527
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:10,570
- Alright, we'll see you
early in the morning.

528
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:13,339
- 7 AM. 6:30 for you.

529
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:27,053
- Let's get this money.

530
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,163
- What's wrong?

531
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:48,241
What's up?

532
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,446
-  You see the two
dudes, across the street?

533
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,482
- Yeah.

534
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,958
-  I don't know, maybe
I'm just being neurotic.

535
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:08,828
Probably just looking
for hookers or

536
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,995
get drugs or some shit.

537
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,601
- Sure.

538
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:16,636
- Yeah, it's nothing.

539
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:49,067
- Hey, I'm going to head out.

540
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,571
- Okay.

541
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,070
- You okay?

542
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,407
- Yeah, I'm okay.

543
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:57,977
Are we okay?

544
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,414
- Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

545
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,250
- Okay. I'll be out in a second.

546
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:23,836
- Yo. Is Bobby coming?

547
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,338
- Yeah, he's supposed to.

548
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,708
-  Alright. Well, let's go.

549
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:41,153
- What?

550
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,328
- What the fuck?
Where's the truck, man?

551
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:52,230
Is this a joke? This
is a joke, right?

552
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:54,232
- No, it's not a fucking
joke. The gate was open.

553
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:57,068
The gate was open!

554
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,805
-  What the fuck, man?!

555
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:01,808
-  It's alright, dude.

556
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:07,581
Calm down. Whatever
happened, I got it on camera.

557
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:14,754
- Maybe one of your guys
forgot to lock the doors.

558
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:15,821
- Not a chance.

559
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:17,389
- How do you know?

560
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,560
- Because I'm the
guy who locks it.

561
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,293
-  Okay.

562
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:23,029
- Wait a second. Right here.

563
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,566
Got it.

564
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:30,136
Who the fuck is that?

565
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:33,573
Never seen him before. He's
coming out the back of the

566
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:35,206
truck, man. It's not
one of your guys?

567
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,710
- No.

568
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:37,643
- You didn't check
all the barrels in the

569
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:38,878
back of the van?

570
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,379
- Fuck.

571
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:44,016
I got to call Bobby. Fuck.

572
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,054
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

573
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,722
Fuck.

574
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,356
Hey man, the weeds' gone.

575
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,392
We're fucked, call me.

576
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,913
Yo, Bobby?

577
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:15,615
- Hello?

578
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:16,682
- Is Bobby home?

579
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:17,818
- Who are you?

580
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:20,285
No, I have not seen him.

581
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:20,620
You cannot just walk
in here like this.

582
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:21,520
- Bobby?!

583
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:25,958
- Can I help you something?

584
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,460
- No. Bobby!

585
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,895
- Jackie, the door!

586
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:32,064
- Oh. - Hey!

587
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:33,633
- Do you know where Bobby is?

588
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:35,433
- No, I don't know.
He left this morning.

589
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:37,369
- Did he say where he's going?

590
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:38,571
- I don't know. He got
a call when he left.

591
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:39,872
Get the hell out of here!

592
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:41,306
- Fuck!

593
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,341
- Did he say you can come over?

594
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,645
You just walk at people's
houses like you own it?

595
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:47,681
You just going to
keep on walking, huh?

596
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,449
Fucking white boys.

597
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,981
- Hey.

598
00:36:21,983 --> 00:36:23,315
- Hi, can I help you?

599
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:25,551
- Yeah, I'm looking
for some guys who were

600
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:26,619
doing  business out
of here the other day?

601
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:28,621
- Oh. Um, whoever was here left.

602
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:30,857
The lease was up yesterday.

603
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,593
- Is there somebody else
that has their, did they give

604
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,696
their contact?
Anything I can get?

605
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:39,432
- We're a short-term lease
company. So, I wouldn't know.

606
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:41,901
- What somebody else? Like
maybe there's another manager or

607
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:43,035
like somebody else
in the office?

608
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:44,236
- Look, I don't know.

609
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:45,137
- I mean, I'm sure
there's somebody.

610
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,906
- I'm so sorry,
I can't help you.

611
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,107
- Yeah. Okay, listen.

612
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:48,674
I'm sure there's somebody there.

613
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:49,876
- No, I need you to leave.

614
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:51,177
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

615
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:53,980
What the fuck is wrong? Hey!

616
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:18,369
- How many days you have left?

617
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:20,371
- Six?
- Come on, man. That's crazy!

618
00:37:20,373 --> 00:37:22,407
Borrow it was less.

619
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,642
- Where'd you get
that? On his website?

620
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:25,511
- Come on man, I'm
fucked right now.

621
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,113
- You're not fucked.
You got to think, man.

622
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:27,913
Watch the buds. Watch
the buds, man. They

623
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:31,717
get harvested next week.
Who owes you money?

624
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,319
- Bobby collected whatever
little debt was owed.

625
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:35,888
- See that's bullshit, dude.

626
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,858
That's why we need safe
banking. Growers, dispensaries

627
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,794
can't get any kind of bank
accounts. No loans, it's
bullshit.

628
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:43,028
- Fuck, man.

629
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,896
I think I'm going
to go talk to him.

630
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:44,462
- Talk to who?

631
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:45,898
- The guy!

632
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,399
- And what? Tell him
you can't pay him?

633
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:49,068
- No, no. If he's a
businessman, he's gonna

634
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,503
want to work something out.

635
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:52,873
- Yeah, break your legs.

636
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,316
- Your call has
been forwarded to an

637
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:06,284
automatic voice message system.

638
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:07,452
- Fuck.

639
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,918
- Vincent Spinano, welcome.

640
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:14,654
Where's your partner?

641
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:16,523
- Bobby couldn't make it.

642
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,093
- He's a busy guy.
What can I do for you?

643
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:23,563
We had some
complications, you and I.

644
00:39:24,232 --> 00:39:26,532
The exchange went well.

645
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,535
We just got crossed
and lost the product.

646
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,003
- What do you mean
lost the product?

647
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:32,905
- It's gone. There's
a guy in the back of

648
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:34,740
the truck. We get
back to the warehouse,

649
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:36,609
he got out, drove off with it.

650
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:39,712
- Like a trojan horse.

651
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:40,478
- You think it was the guy
that sold you the flower?

652
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,082
- Yeah, it had to be.

653
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,650
- Where'd they go?

654
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,353
- I don't know. Went by their
place, everyone was gone.

655
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:48,888
- Is Bobby with you?

656
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,156
- No.

657
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:55,027
- And you've come here
because you can't pay me back.

658
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:57,196
- No, we're going
to pay you back.

659
00:39:57,198 --> 00:40:01,432
- Well, you have a week. Where's
the five days now? Surely you

660
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:04,803
can come up with something by
then. Maybe even a bit of story.

661
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,239
- We got it on tape.

662
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:09,042
- Should probably go to
the police then, huh?

663
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,778
- Look, I came by here
to meet you face to face.

664
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,148
We could work something out.

665
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,819
Maybe renegotiate the
payments or the terms.

666
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:25,524
- I think you have me
confused with a bank.

667
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:26,392
You know what it's like
if it gets out that

668
00:40:26,394 --> 00:40:27,559
I'm giving away, grace periods

669
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:31,430
and amending deals?
It makes me look soft.

670
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,867
You know our street critters?

671
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:35,201
- Yeah, of course.

672
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:36,335
- Then stop fucking with me.

673
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:41,107
- How do you know your partner
is not involved in all this?

674
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:42,876
- Nah, Bobby wouldn't do this.

675
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:45,244
- He works with a lot
of people, that guy.

676
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:48,748
Find the guys, find your
partner, you understand?

677
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,684
- You have five days.

678
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:53,820
- Yeah, okay.

679
00:40:54,355 --> 00:40:55,722
- Hey, Vincent.

680
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,124
Plan on seeing Bobby?

681
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:00,961
- Yeah, at some point.

682
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:03,830
- I might have a deal for you.

683
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,000
- Fuck, fuck!

684
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:15,241
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

685
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,110
Pick up.

686
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:19,946
- No one is
available to pick up-

687
00:41:32,193 --> 00:41:33,760
- What's wrong?

688
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:35,195
- Nothing.

689
00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:37,263
- Doesn't look like nothing.

690
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:38,496
- Just work stuff.

691
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,999
- Yeah?

692
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:41,267
- Yeah.

693
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:43,736
- Okay, because I want
to show you something

694
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:45,972
but I don't want
you to get upset.

695
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:47,406
- Okay.

696
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:48,908
- Okay.

697
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:00,954
So,

698
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,723
I've been thinking
a lot about us

699
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:07,059
and we're not
getting any younger

700
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:09,561
and I just needed
some solid ground.

701
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:11,597
So I took a test the other day,

702
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,199
when you saw me.

703
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,905
I mean, I just think
this is a sign.

704
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:21,206
Just promise you won't get mad.

705
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,341
- Yeah, promise.

706
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,011
- Look, after what happened
today everything's downhill.

707
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:27,679
- Okay.

708
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:30,049
So the test, it came
back a little faint.

709
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,185
So I took another one today.

710
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,722
And before I even looked
at it I just thought,

711
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:39,458
what is it that I want to see?

712
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,561
I don't know if it's right but

713
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,500
- Shit! Shit!

714
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:50,702
Shit!

715
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:03,817
Hey! Where the
fuck have you been?

716
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,619
Are you alone?

717
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:09,955
Yeah.

718
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:10,956
Fine.

719
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,258
I'll see you there in 10.

720
00:43:31,513 --> 00:43:32,945
- Hey.

721
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:35,848
- Where the fuck
have you been, man?

722
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,216
- This wasn't supposed
to happen. Alright?

723
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:37,983
- Are you working
with these guys?

724
00:43:37,985 --> 00:43:40,587
- Yes, but not on our job.

725
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:43,556
Alright, they fucked me. But
I swear I didn't know man.

726
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:44,923
- You don't know what the
guys in the back of the truck.

727
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:47,560
- No. They were rolling
over other dealers

728
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:49,229
but they weren't supposed to
roll us. That was never the
plan.

729
00:43:50,164 --> 00:43:51,763
I had to make ends meet
Vince. You've been hurting.

730
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:53,332
- Fuck, Bobby.

731
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:57,402
- You know where they are now?

732
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:59,371
- I don't know, man. Armenia,
Paris, Italy. I don't know.

733
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:01,074
They got their money and they
left. That was their plan.

734
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:05,911
- The girl at your house,
she said you got a call.

735
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:07,313
Did you know before me?

736
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:13,786
- You went to my house? A
buddy of mine got screwed, too.

737
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:16,788
He calls me. I have to go see
him. I can't see him and see
you.

738
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,657
- So you fucking let
me discover by myself?!

739
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,225
- I didn't mean for this shit.

740
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:22,060
I didn't mean for this
shit to happen, Vince

741
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:23,429
I swear!

742
00:44:27,502 --> 00:44:30,403
- By the way, your other
boss is looking for you, too.

743
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,973
You saw him?

744
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:36,042
- Yeah, I saw him. I couldn't
get in touch with you.

745
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:40,713
- Why would you do that?
What did you tell him?

746
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:45,618
- I told him we got screwed.
Asked to cut us a deal, but

747
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,053
that ain't happening. Instead,
he tells me I deliver you

748
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:50,023
he'll cut me a deal.

749
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:52,425
- Vince, no.

750
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:56,462
He wants to kill me, man.

751
00:44:57,431 --> 00:44:59,132
I screwed up, Vince.

752
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:06,205
- Okay. Look, look,
look, look. Hey!

753
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:08,073
- I never fucking found you.

754
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:10,310
Nobody's here.
Nobody's going to know.

755
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:13,812
- He's gonna know.
He's gonna know, man.

756
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:15,415
I don't know how he
just has his ways.

757
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:16,683
Look, he's a crazy motherfucker.

758
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:18,218
He will kill both of us.

759
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:23,289
You know, what?
It's not your fault.

760
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:28,161
I'll go meet him. I'll
talk to him, it'll be fine.

761
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:31,664
- Hey. Look, we got
to stick together.

762
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,233
You're too fucking young, kid.

763
00:45:34,301 --> 00:45:35,868
We stick together
in this, Bobby.

764
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,804
- I know.

765
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:43,442
- You've always been like
a brother to me, Vince.

766
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:44,811
But you got to trust
that I can handle this.

767
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,214
I'll talk to him.

768
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:50,049
It's gonna be fine.

769
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:51,984
- Bobby.

770
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:14,240
- It's positive.

771
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:30,956
- Sorry.

772
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,792
Yeah. May I grab this?

773
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:34,860
- Okay.

774
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:12,332
- Get in, Vince.

775
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:39,158
- So? how's it going?

776
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:42,161
- It's going.

777
00:47:42,831 --> 00:47:44,464
- It's a beautiful day out.

778
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:48,935
- So hey, it's nice out
everyday. Some people that suck.

779
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,172
- Oh, that's not very nice,
Vince. Have you seen Bobby
lately?

780
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,909
- No.

781
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,532
- What are we doing here?

782
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,534
- We're gonna need
your cellphone.

783
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:22,000
- Give me the fucking phone.

784
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:23,569
- Why?

785
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:24,236
-  How about shut your
yapper and give me

786
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,272
the fucking phone?

787
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:40,386
- I get this feeling I'm going
for a long walk off a short
pier.

788
00:48:42,156 --> 00:48:44,625
- I want to show you one
of my new favorite spots.

789
00:49:08,817 --> 00:49:11,117
- We had a telling you the
last time we met, Vince.

790
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:12,984
- We're going to pay you.

791
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:15,556
- I know you won't.

792
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,624
- Get over there. Get
on your fucking knees.

793
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:20,727
Go down there. You heard
what the fuck I said.

794
00:49:22,196 --> 00:49:24,263
- Come on, guys. We've
got 4 more days, okay?

795
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:25,565
Don't fucking hurt
him. He's just a kid.

796
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,065
We got some money, okay?

797
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,434
- I don't like being
lied to, Vince.

798
00:49:28,503 --> 00:49:30,101
- Just give us a
couple more days

799
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,104
and we will get you
your money, please.

800
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:34,941
Come on, come on. No!

801
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:40,146
- It's my turn, hand
me the fucking knife.

802
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:43,316
- Fuck!

803
00:49:43,718 --> 00:49:45,552
No, no! Don't do it!

804
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:46,687
-  Street cred, Vince.

805
00:49:50,725 --> 00:49:52,157
- No!

806
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,874
- Put him down and
push him in the water.

807
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:11,042
Let's go.

808
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:13,813
You have four days, Vince.

809
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:39,605
- 911, what's your emergency?

810
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:40,973
- Yeah.

811
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,160
- Ticket, sir?

812
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:56,441
- What's wrong?

813
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:23,536
- Glad you called me.

814
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:24,871
Look, she can stay with
me as long as you need.

815
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:26,906
Alright, I got the extra bed
in the hangar, it's no problem.

816
00:53:26,908 --> 00:53:28,307
- Thanks.

817
00:53:29,177 --> 00:53:30,843
- Can't even begin to imagine
what you're going through.

818
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:34,915
- I'm so screwed I
don't know what to do.

819
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:36,749
- You find the money.

820
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:38,818
Guys like this are twisted
and they're not normal.

821
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,586
- They're going to come
after me no matter what.

822
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:41,554
They want the money
and the license.

823
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:42,855
- You don't know that.

824
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:46,058
- I signed a contract. I
pay them, they kill me.

825
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,527
They have them both.

826
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:51,564
You haven't been to
something like this before?

827
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:53,331
- Not to this extent,
but something like it.

828
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,635
- Whoa, what'd you do?

829
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,636
- I hired someone.

830
00:53:57,638 --> 00:53:58,871
- Who?

831
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:00,272
- Buddy Houston.

832
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:03,743
- You still got his info?

833
00:54:03,745 --> 00:54:06,045
- But you got to contact
someone who contact someone

834
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:08,413
to contact this guy. Look
Vince, maybe you can find the

835
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:10,817
money. Just focus on that.

836
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:13,085
- I've been trying.
It's impossible, man.

837
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:14,721
- It's too much money to raise.

838
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:19,725
This fucking guy, he
doesn't have an army.

839
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:20,993
He has a few hired
men around him.

840
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:24,496
That's it. Go in there
and take them all out.

841
00:54:24,498 --> 00:54:26,800
No retaliation, no
trace or nothing.

842
00:54:27,902 --> 00:54:29,835
- Ah, fuck. I don't
know what I'm thinking.

843
00:54:29,837 --> 00:54:31,637
- You're thinking
ahead. That's good.

844
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,873
I mean, come on. You know,
we're not accountants.

845
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,876
Sometimes we have to do things,
other people don't have to.

846
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,013
- Yeah. Thanks.

847
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:40,980
-  I always got your back.

848
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:42,381
- Alright.

849
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:43,950
- I'll be back.

850
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,060
- Are we safe?

851
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:57,763
- Yeah, they don't
know about Connor.

852
00:54:57,765 --> 00:54:59,397
Or where he lives,
so we're good.

853
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:01,233
- Why can't we just
go to the police then?

854
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:03,869
- We can't. I'm in too deep
and besides these guys, they're

855
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:05,906
crazy. They'll come after
me and everything I love.

856
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,042
-  I'm scared, Vince.

857
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,344
- I know. I'm sorry for
putting you through this.

858
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:16,049
- This isn't how we're
supposed to live.

859
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:29,295
- I'll fix this, I promise.

860
00:55:29,297 --> 00:55:30,630
- You have to.

861
00:57:35,523 --> 00:57:38,091
- Yeah, I'd like to withdraw
my money and close my account.

862
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,425
Thank you.

863
00:57:56,243 --> 00:57:58,877
- I feel bad. I wish I could
have given you the entire loan,

864
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:00,145
but my money's tied
up in this place.

865
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:02,982
- It's all good. I just
feel a fucking idiot to be

866
00:58:02,984 --> 00:58:04,550
leaving that fucking truck here.

867
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:06,819
- How much you raised so far?

868
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:08,121
- Not enough.

869
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:09,956
- Not enough.

870
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:13,660
Well, I want to give you 5k.

871
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:15,861
- No, no, no, Frank. I'm
not here to get money.

872
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:17,196
- I got the money
all ready for you.

873
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:19,131
- I can't take your
money, brother.

874
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:21,534
- Good. Take the money.
We'll figure it out.

875
00:58:23,738 --> 00:58:24,770
- Thanks brother.

876
00:58:24,772 --> 00:58:26,139
- No worries.

877
00:58:28,776 --> 00:58:30,110
- Hey Franco.

878
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:34,980
- Sorry to ask for another
favor, brother, but I really
came

879
00:58:34,982 --> 00:58:36,516
by to see if I could
get one of your guns.

880
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:40,119
- Come on, man. You don't
go mess with no guns.

881
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:41,820
- I don't want to,
but I mean, after

882
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,455
what happened to Bobby,
I just gotta protect

883
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:44,957
myself. You still got them?

884
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:46,358
- I mean, yeah,
I still got them.

885
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,494
I just can't give you my guns,
they're registered to me.

886
00:58:48,496 --> 00:58:49,929
Something happens, I'm fucked.

887
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:51,330
Sure someone in your line
of work knows someone

888
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:53,066
who has one? Maybe go there.

889
00:58:53,601 --> 00:58:55,769
- Yeah, yeah. Maybe.

890
00:58:56,937 --> 00:58:58,303
- How you doing, baby?

891
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:01,106
- I'd like to be home
but I'm holding up.

892
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:05,377
- I know. I'm sorry.
Look at you doing great.

893
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:07,613
- I've been thinking. I don't
know if your lifestyle is

894
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:09,115
suited to raising a family.

895
00:59:09,617 --> 00:59:10,916
- What do you mean?

896
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,985
- Maybe it is. But just
not mine. I'm putting an

897
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:15,587
option out there, okay? If
you're looking for an out,

898
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:16,722
I'm giving you one.

899
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:18,191
- You don't mean that.

900
00:59:18,726 --> 00:59:20,727
- I just wish you were here.

901
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:23,296
- Me too.

902
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:25,464
Hey, I'll see you soon.

903
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,054
- Hey.

904
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,655
- Hey.

905
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:26,126
- Can I help you?

906
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:28,460
- Yes, ah...

907
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:31,164
- Is Ruth around?

908
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:32,899
- Who are you?

909
01:00:34,435 --> 01:00:36,202
- Vince.

910
01:00:38,906 --> 01:00:40,507
- Yeah. She's out back.

911
01:00:40,509 --> 01:00:41,640
- Ah, good.

912
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:51,518
- So, how long
have you been here?

913
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,154
- Plus six months.

914
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:59,292
We don't get many visitors.

915
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,895
Ruth.

916
01:01:02,897 --> 01:01:04,264
[horse neighing

917
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:23,816
- I was wondering
when I'd see you.

918
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:26,386
- It's been a while.

919
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:28,087
- Staying for dinner?

920
01:01:29,823 --> 01:01:32,660
- Huh, I don't know. Maybe.

921
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,974
- So where you coming in from?

922
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:49,775
- LA.

923
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:52,211
- What's in LA?

924
01:01:54,114 --> 01:01:56,349
- Ah, my work and my girlfriend.

925
01:01:57,885 --> 01:01:58,685
- Why didn't she come with you?

926
01:01:59,954 --> 01:02:01,020
- She's staying with a friend.

927
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:03,922
- Same one from a few years ago?

928
01:02:03,924 --> 01:02:06,359
- Yeah, Tabatha.

929
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:07,827
- I liked her.

930
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:12,632
She was very sweet. You talking
about moving in together?

931
01:02:12,634 --> 01:02:14,100
- Yeah, we did.

932
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:16,002
- Oh.

933
01:02:20,241 --> 01:02:21,507
- I'm gonna come back
out to the stables.

934
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:22,842
- Okay, honey.

935
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:33,386
Clara joined us about six
months ago from Minnesota.

936
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:35,821
There's another one
in the back house,

937
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:37,290
but he's just passing through.

938
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:41,360
She's been real helpful.
Getting the barn things cleaned

939
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:42,929
up around here.

940
01:02:45,866 --> 01:02:47,534
- How're the horses, Ma?

941
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:50,203
- Most of them died
from the drought.

942
01:02:50,705 --> 01:02:52,506
- Sorry.

943
01:02:53,073 --> 01:02:55,509
- It's fine. You didn't know.

944
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,877
- I tried calling.

945
01:02:57,978 --> 01:02:59,546
- I know.

946
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:08,454
Something's wrong?

947
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:13,192
-  Everything's wrong right now.

948
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,529
- I know. I knew
before you said hi.

949
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:18,898
Is it money you need?

950
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:22,968
- No. Yeah, but
that's not why I came.

951
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,971
- Why did you come?

952
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:27,240
- Just gonna grab your stuff.

953
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,309
- Stuff? What's, what stuff?

954
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:32,111
- It's just some stuff, Ma.

955
01:03:33,748 --> 01:03:35,180
- There you go.
It's the same shit

956
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:36,948
your father used to pull.

957
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:38,851
- Don't compare me to him.

958
01:03:38,886 --> 01:03:39,918
-  I don't know what kind of

959
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,588
trouble you're
in, but walk away.

960
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,156
- I can't.

961
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,592
- This is about that
dope you deal, isn't it?

962
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,694
I know your father
didn't give you kids

963
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:50,229
any direction and I blame
him for your brother.

964
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:51,664
- Ma, don't bring him up.

965
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:53,032
- It's true!

966
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:56,903
Don't be like him!
Look how he wound up.

967
01:03:58,038 --> 01:04:00,106
Know when to say
enough is enough.

968
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:25,598
- So nice out here, huh?

969
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,100
- Yeah.

970
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:29,035
- You mind?

971
01:04:30,404 --> 01:04:31,870
- Where are you going with it?

972
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:33,105
- Inside.

973
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:44,585
- Over here's fine.

974
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:47,453
- Huh.

975
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:50,356
- Um, have a seat if you want.

976
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,892
I am gonna go get changed.

977
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:10,276
- Hey, have you
seen a rifle around?

978
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,980
- Ah, the Bold action?

979
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:17,584
- Yeah, that's the one.

980
01:05:19,186 --> 01:05:23,021
- Yeah. Um, we use it
to kill the coyotes.

981
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:24,625
- You guys still need it?

982
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:30,095
- Ah, no. I can get it for you.

983
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:31,464
- That'd be great. Thanks.

984
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:41,107
- Sorry. It's so
dusty out there.

985
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:53,386
You smoke?

986
01:05:53,555 --> 01:05:55,021
- No.

987
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:57,289
- Did you find that
a little ironic?

988
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,725
- My mom told you what I do?

989
01:05:59,928 --> 01:06:01,394
- Yep.

990
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:07,867
I hope you don't mind if I do.

991
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:08,967
- No, that's fine.

992
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:20,246
- You don't know
what you're missing.

993
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:26,486
Wanna hear some music?

994
01:06:26,754 --> 01:06:28,386
- No, I actually, you know what?

995
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:30,089
That rifle would be great.

996
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:33,192
- We'll get there.

997
01:06:53,982 --> 01:06:56,047
- So you know
where the rifle is?

998
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:11,264
- Is this what
you're looking for?

999
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:24,243
- I see the way you look at me.

1000
01:07:24,946 --> 01:07:26,411
- How do I look at you?

1001
01:07:28,181 --> 01:07:29,214
- You know how.

1002
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,185
No one's gonna know.

1003
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:06,117
- Next time, stay longer.

1004
01:08:08,455 --> 01:08:10,456
- It's awfully
friendly around here.

1005
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:17,229
- Listen, I'm sorry. I just
get a little emotional.

1006
01:08:17,665 --> 01:08:19,098
I love you.

1007
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:21,133
- I love you too, Ma.

1008
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:25,638
- Here you go.

1009
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,272
- No, no.

1010
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:28,874
- It's just a couple of
thousand. It'll help you.

1011
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:29,875
- I'm good.

1012
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:31,109
- Just take it.

1013
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:33,714
- Please. I'm okay. Promise.

1014
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:36,616
- I want you to have
some peace. You don't

1015
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:38,918
always have to be
chasing something.

1016
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,821
You can settle down.
I want some grandkids!

1017
01:08:44,025 --> 01:08:45,525
- I love you, Ma.

1018
01:09:54,227 --> 01:09:55,193
- Are you okay?

1019
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:56,830
- As best I can be.

1020
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:01,366
- I'm sorry. Is Scott around?

1021
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:02,735
- He's in the hangar.

1022
01:10:02,737 --> 01:10:03,937
- Come on.

1023
01:10:05,907 --> 01:10:07,941
- Talk to the guy.
He give me tonight.

1024
01:10:09,043 --> 01:10:10,176
Sure you want to do this?

1025
01:10:10,178 --> 01:10:11,912
- Absolutely.

1026
01:10:24,424 --> 01:10:26,459
- Is that him?

1027
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,194
-  Yeah, that's him.

1028
01:10:46,214 --> 01:10:47,146
- Thanks for coming.

1029
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:48,481
- Sure thing.

1030
01:10:50,518 --> 01:10:53,385
- Here's the pictures
and informational.

1031
01:10:54,155 --> 01:10:55,655
- Great.

1032
01:10:56,991 --> 01:10:58,389
Any home security I
should know about?

1033
01:10:58,391 --> 01:10:59,760
Guards? Dogs?

1034
01:11:01,596 --> 01:11:04,196
- There's only a  couple of
guys. One large, tatted up guy.

1035
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:06,297
I didn't see any dogs.

1036
01:11:06,299 --> 01:11:08,100
I imagine there's cameras
but I can't say for certain.

1037
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:09,435
- That's fine.

1038
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:15,708
I don't take Bitcoin.
Cash only. 25,000.

1039
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,878
10,000 for anyone else
I have to takeout.

1040
01:11:18,746 --> 01:11:19,945
- Yeah.

1041
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:21,312
- That's good.

1042
01:11:21,314 --> 01:11:22,682
- Half upfront.

1043
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:32,324
Good. I'd be in
touch with you guys.

1044
01:11:33,161 --> 01:11:35,127
- What if we need to
get in touch with you?

1045
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:37,730
You know? So how do
we know where you are?

1046
01:11:37,732 --> 01:11:41,600
- Only my protégé knows. GPS.

1047
01:11:41,602 --> 01:11:43,737
And I'll call you guys
once the day in check in.

1048
01:11:49,342 --> 01:11:50,811
- Wow.

1049
01:11:51,712 --> 01:11:52,945
Fuck.

1050
01:13:28,743 --> 01:13:31,011
- Who are you working with?!

1051
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:32,679
- Hard to refresh some
guy, I don't know.

1052
01:13:33,347 --> 01:13:35,815
- Give us the name or this
is gonna last all day.

1053
01:13:36,117 --> 01:13:37,683
- I don't know, just
fucking some guy.

1054
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:39,753
- Old man, who are
you working with?

1055
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:43,488
- Alright, it's Scott.
You know this Carter?

1056
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:44,757
- Who's Carter?

1057
01:13:44,759 --> 01:13:46,726
- How do I fucking know?

1058
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:48,027
- That answers your question?

1059
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:49,561
- Let me go! Let me go!

1060
01:13:49,563 --> 01:13:50,596
- This is gonna hurt.

1061
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:51,965
- No!

1062
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:53,499
- Better get your ass
moving if you wanna see

1063
01:13:53,501 --> 01:13:55,267
your girlfriend alive, Vince.

1064
01:15:13,948 --> 01:15:19,518
- Nice job, Fredo. What the
fuck? You missed a spot, man.

1065
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,953
Cover it up.

1066
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:23,155
You know how hard it
is to clean that up?

1067
01:15:23,157 --> 01:15:24,524
- What the fuck.

1068
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:27,526
- Where the fuck's my girl?

1069
01:15:28,562 --> 01:15:29,862
- I'm ready.

1070
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:31,164
- Good.

1071
01:15:31,632 --> 01:15:33,233
- You fucking
assholes! Where is she?

1072
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:37,003
- She's fine. The boss want to
have some fun with her first.

1073
01:15:38,105 --> 01:15:42,307
- Look, you got what you
wanted. Just let her go.

1074
01:15:42,309 --> 01:15:45,611
- You tried to kill our boss.
You tried to steal our money.

1075
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:49,849
Look at where you're
at. Look around.

1076
01:15:50,519 --> 01:15:52,751
- The problem with
the world today,

1077
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:56,089
is people like you think
you're owned something.

1078
01:15:57,691 --> 01:16:01,860
You're not owning anything.
You're about to choke to death

1079
01:16:01,862 --> 01:16:04,898
on your own blood at the
hands of this artist.

1080
01:16:05,534 --> 01:16:09,568
I'm really sorry you didn't get
to watch his master work with

1081
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:10,636
your friend, Bobby.

1082
01:16:10,638 --> 01:16:11,670
- Fucking assholes!

1083
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:17,242
- It's time to go.

1084
01:16:19,713 --> 01:16:21,081
- Hey, look.

1085
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:25,417
You got what you
want. Just let her go.

1086
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,847
- What the fuck?

1087
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:58,084
- Don't fucking move.

1088
01:16:58,853 --> 01:17:00,053
-Who the fuck are you?

1089
01:17:01,989 --> 01:17:03,055
- Who's that over there?

1090
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:04,891
- Somebody that got in the way.

1091
01:17:16,937 --> 01:17:18,170
- Did you hire my father?

1092
01:17:18,172 --> 01:17:19,404
- Yeah.

1093
01:17:19,406 --> 01:17:20,906
- How much did it cost?

1094
01:17:20,908 --> 01:17:23,008
- It's 25 grand. 10,000

1095
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,443
for anyone else that
gets in the way.

1096
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:32,852
Jesus. How the hell
did you find us?

1097
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:38,390
- He keeps a tracker in
his belt. Doesn't give me

1098
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:39,892
all the details, but
may I see how is that?

1099
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,438
- Fuck.

1100
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:56,176
- What are you doing?

1101
01:17:56,977 --> 01:17:59,846
- Checking their phones.
Check the GPS history.

1102
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:04,117
See if I can find my
girlfriend. God damn it.

1103
01:18:04,218 --> 01:18:06,286
- There's somebody
else responsible?

1104
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,887
- Yeah, these guys have a boss.

1105
01:18:09,023 --> 01:18:10,923
What about your dad's tracker?

1106
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:12,425
- No, it's just a
tracking device.

1107
01:18:12,459 --> 01:18:13,593
It doesn't have a history.

1108
01:18:13,595 --> 01:18:14,893
- Fuck.

1109
01:18:14,895 --> 01:18:16,162
- Try to call her.

1110
01:18:24,506 --> 01:18:25,872
- I'm sorry.

1111
01:18:26,675 --> 01:18:29,275
- He knew the game. We all do.

1112
01:18:32,514 --> 01:18:34,981
Hey. Are you gonna kill him?

1113
01:18:36,217 --> 01:18:37,383
- I don't know.

1114
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:40,719
- Well, if you do,
consider us even.

1115
01:22:32,052 --> 01:22:33,419
boot thumps]

1116
01:22:56,945 --> 01:22:57,976
- Oh, babe.

1117
01:22:57,978 --> 01:22:59,411
- Babe.

1118
01:22:59,413 --> 01:23:00,313
- I'm so sorry. Let
me unite you up.

1119
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:04,417
- Babe!

1120
01:23:16,965 --> 01:23:18,129
- Ah!

1121
01:23:30,377 --> 01:23:32,778
- Funny enough, I think
today was your deadline.

1122
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:38,585
- It's in our agreement page.

1123
01:23:55,603 --> 01:23:57,103
- Babe!

1124
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:49,055
- Ah.

1125
01:24:49,057 --> 01:24:50,423
- Are you okay?

1126
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:54,527
- I made a mistake. Should
I hide you as my Hitman?

1127
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:01,100
I love you.

1128
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:11,010
Now get me to a hospital.

1129
01:25:11,012 --> 01:25:12,210
- Oh.

1130
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:18,017
In the end, I probably
should have just

1131
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:19,619
gone out of business.
It would have been way

1132
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:22,555
easier that way. But
it is what it is.

1133
01:25:37,337 --> 01:25:39,471
The business completely changed.

1134
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:41,607
As legalization picked
up, no longer did

1135
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:43,577
anyone need the dealer,
nor are deliveries.

1136
01:25:44,646 --> 01:25:47,947
It was now big business.com kids
or White Collar professionals

1137
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:52,051
running the show. Everyone
wanted in on the action. You
want

1138
01:25:52,053 --> 01:25:54,654
a delivery? There's an app
for that. You have a problem

1139
01:25:54,656 --> 01:25:58,323
with the supplier? Call your
lawyer. You want to own a

1140
01:25:58,325 --> 01:26:01,226
part of a cannabis company?
There's an overpriced stock on
Wall

1141
01:26:01,228 --> 01:26:04,130
Street. I was squeezed out
of   business I was on the

1142
01:26:04,132 --> 01:26:06,999
forefront of. And even
worse, no one ever known.

1143
01:26:07,001 --> 01:26:09,167
Nor paid me for it.

1144
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:13,039
But I was never owed
anything. Maybe I should have

1145
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:18,077
been. When I was breaking
the law. I have a family with

1146
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:21,380
Tabitha now, and I went back to
doing what I do best. Growing.

1147
01:26:22,315 --> 01:26:25,685
Even better. I was working in
what got deemed an essential

1148
01:26:25,687 --> 01:26:30,523
business. Job security, go
figure. I'm making enough money

1149
01:26:30,525 --> 01:26:33,191
that I paid for Bobby's sister's
college education. I know

1150
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:35,394
he would have appreciated that.

1151
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:39,732
Cannabis, flower, hemp,
marijuana, whatever

1152
01:26:39,734 --> 01:26:42,968
you want to call it, it became
the highest revenue-generating

1153
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:47,541
agricultural crop in California.
And I know how to grow it.

1154
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:53,880
I went full circle.
That's my story.
