ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the
Planet is Burning Tour.

00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:20,411
And without further ado,
it's time to give it up

00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,893

the person we all adore,

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,696
Sex with me so amazing.

8
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:48,439
All this hard work, no vacation.

9
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,053
Stay up off my Instagram,
pure temptation.

10
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:56,708
Hit a switch on a fake
nigga like a station.

11
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:04,839
Sex with me so amazing.

12
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:09,895
Vodka and a water, and a lemon.

13
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:14,204
And a few other things
I cannot mention.

14
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:17,468
Five fingers on
it, five fingers.

15
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,399
Hit it like you own it,
hit it like I'm on it.

Straight shots of the blue dot,
shots shots shots shots, baby.

17
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:22,807
I'ma pick your poison.

18
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,084
Ooh-ee, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:29,741
I'm off that la-la.

20
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:32,048
I'ma get it wet like Jacuzzi.

[cheering]

25
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:49,935
Thank you so much.

26
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:05,125
Yes.

27
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:09,085
Thank you.
Thank you.

28
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,521
Wow.

29
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:11,552
[inaudible]

30
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:12,393
So good to see you.

31
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,743
Thank you so much
for being here.

32
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:18,616
I believe y'all know me as
Ilana Wexler from "Broad City."

33
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:26,276
You love it.

34
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:27,451
I love "Broad City."

35
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:30,498
It's my favorite TV show ever.

36
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,935
Duh.

37
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:35,285
And I love Ilana Wexler.

38
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,723
But I am really excited to
introduce you to Ilana Glazer

39
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:39,894
the stand up this evening.

40
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:50,300
Because there are a lot of
differences between Ilana

41
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,433
Wexler and Ilana Glazer.

42
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:55,740
You're going to be shocked
as well as impressed.

43
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:03,574
Like for example, Ilana Wexler
obviously wakes and bakes.

44
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:04,358
OK.

45
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:05,388
Hey.

46
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:06,766
You know, she wakes
up with a bowl

47
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:10,320
betwixt her breasts
from the night before.

48
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,148
And she gives it
the old one-handed

49
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,976
[breathing] oh, yeah.

50
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:24,508
Ilana Glazer, on the other hand,
wakes up, takes her vitamins,

51
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,596
and then I get high.

52
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:34,866
So Ilana Wexler wake and
bake, Ilana Glazer wake,

53
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:36,128
take, and bake.

54
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,354
Ilana Wexler is free to buy
her weed wherever the fuck.

55
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:48,489
In the street, in a
little building nook,

56
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:50,926
biking over the Manhattan
Bridge in one swift move.

57
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:52,449
I'll Venmo you later!

58
00:03:55,757 --> 00:04:02,416
In my real life, though, I
have my husband buy our weed

59
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,854
from a New York
delivery service,

60
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,596
while I hide in the closet
scrolling Instagram.

61
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:11,846
I know.

62
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,297
It sounds so 1950s.

63
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:18,475
Like, I have my
husband buy our weed.

64
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:20,085
While I hide in the closet.

65
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:26,483
I just don't want people
knowing where I live.

66
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:31,401
And listen, it's not
like I'm like, so famous.

67
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:35,318
It's just that New
York weed delivery

68
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,668
people make up 80% of my demo.

69
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,847
And the other 20%
is here tonight.

70
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,110
Thank you so much for coming.

71
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:49,289
Oh, thank God you're here.

72
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,378
Tejas, I am so
excited to be here.

73
00:04:56,252 --> 00:05:00,082
So the government is on fire.

74
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,112
And so is the planet.

75
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,479
The planet is on fucking fire.

76
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:10,614
And the mean dinosaurs in
office just don't seem to mind.

77
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,095
No.

78
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:17,404
I think they want us to die,
because they're about to die.

79
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,409
That is the ultimate FOMO.

80
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:30,504
One thing that gives me hope is
the gender-nonconforming youth.

81
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:36,858
I think it is amazing.

82
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:40,688
I find it just incredible to
see these young people have the

83
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:44,648
agency to say I am non-binary.

84
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,520
I don't have that
kind of agency.

85
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,260
And I literally have agents.

86
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:56,660
It makes me so
hopeful that maybe,

87
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:01,752
just maybe, the end of baby
boomer culture is nigh.

88
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:02,783
Oh.

89
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:14,591
Because we have been fed the
crappiest, most boring script.

90
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:19,422
The script that says that we
can only play one of two parts.

91
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:27,553
And that is either that of a
masculine man, I don't know.

92
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:34,959
Gun show or whatever.

93
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:42,576
Or we can play, a, oh, yeah,
frickin' feminine woman, oh.

94
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:43,606
Oh.

95
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,930
It hurts.

96
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,933
It really hurts.

97
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:55,763
Wobbling on these tiny
little Betty Boop feet.

98
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:01,508
I can barely balance my
big Betty Boop boobs.

99
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:11,300
Before a tour, I went to
dinner with my friend,

100
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,649
who is a gold star lesbian.

101
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:19,264
Now, as a Jewish
person, I am not usually

102
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,614
a big fan of gold stars.

103
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,666
But this one I like.

104
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,233
This one I like.

105
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:35,237
A gold star gay girl is a girl
who likes ladies, has always

106
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:39,633
known she liked ladies, and has
not so much as sniffed a dick.

107
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:43,797
I admire it.

108
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:51,688
And she and I just
have a similar vibe.

109
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:59,819
So I asked her, what percentage
female to male do you feel?

110
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,613
And she thought about
it for a second.

111
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:09,314
She was like, I guess
I would say, 60% to 70%

112
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:14,929
female, and 30% to 40% male.

113
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:20,021
And I was like,
Ro, me too, dude.

114
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,285
You took the answer
right out of my mouth.

115
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:26,680
That's exactly the ratio
I was just going to say.

116
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,378
Like, I feel like a little girl.

117
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,118
OK?

118
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,336
I feel like a woman.

119
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,381
OK.

120
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,949
I have like, big titties, durr.

121
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,213
But also, I feel like a
little like, frickin' dude.

122
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:39,040
You know what I mean?

123
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,070
Like a...

124
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,703
I mean, I partially
identify with Mr. Peanut.

125
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,968
I'm like, [singing] who wants
some salty-ass nuts, huh?

126
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:54,795
Whoo.

127
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,710
[singing]

128
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,581
Sweetheart, you're
looking good, sweetheart.

129
00:08:58,712 --> 00:08:59,992
I love that dress on you, honey.

130
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,635
And for my sexuality,
if I were a drink,

131
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,551
I'd be one part gay,
and two parts straight.

132
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:15,105
Thank you.

133
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,817
You do what you want
with your hands.

134
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,470
You know, no pressure.

135
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,820
It's just whatever you want.

136
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,995
Cool.

137
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,025
No presh.

138
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,345
I'm not waiting.

139
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:26,391
You know, I'm just not
desperate for your approval.

140
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:30,308
But one part gay and
two part straight.

141
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,048
OK?

142
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,833
So.

143
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:36,576
You might call that
drink a ginatondick.

144
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,584
Or like, at a different
bar, with a different vibe,

145
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,934
a both sexes on the beach.

146
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,231
I have one more.

147
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:57,335
OK.

148
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,424
Instead of a
Martini, a muffpeeny.

149
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,455
Oh.

150
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,692
Extra nerdy, baby.

151
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:06,722
Yeah.

152
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,089
OK.

153
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,569
So.

154
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,006
As a gold star lesbian,
and as a ginatondick,

155
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,965
we're not supposed
to feel the same.

156
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:18,748
But we do.

157
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,447
We like feel that same thing.

158
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:23,658
And I remembered, oh, yeah.

159
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,320
The whole thing's a sham.

160
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,539
It's a total lie.

161
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,890
You know, like, straight guys?

162
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,589
Straight guys are supposed
to be whoa, the most

163
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,070
masculine people in the world.

164
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:43,555
And I'm talking real
pussy-loving straight dudes,

165
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,949
OK?

166
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,258
Not guys who like,
resentfully fuck their wives

167
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:52,913
and then run to work and create
policy against women's bodies.

168
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,622
Those guys are gay?

169
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,842
I have no idea.

170
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:11,148
I don't know what's
going on there.

171
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,497
What's the diagnosis?

172
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:16,023
You know, I don't know.

173
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,852
But you know what
straight guys like to do?

174
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:23,508
Straight guys love to be
enveloped in the warmth

175
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,249
and wetness of a woman.

176
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:37,522
Straight guys love to
run home and giggle with

177
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,873
and share secrets with a girl.

178
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,488
It's very gay.

179
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:58,195
And straight women, or
women who love dick...

180
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:02,939
So women who love dick, we're
not even supposed to love it.

181
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,814
We are supposed to
merely accept it.

182
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,708
That would suck.

183
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:38,496
No, I feel really like,
dudely when I'm with a dude.

184
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:43,850
I mean, honestly, when I have
a dick anywhere inside of me...

185
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,296
Technically, and I want to
be technical about it now...

186
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:56,326
AUDIENCE: Oh my God.

187
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,521
I have a dick.

188
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,055
I am part penis at that point.

189
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,491
It's crazy.

190
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,842
It feels wild to be a woman
attracted to men, you know?

191
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:24,455
If this superior design,
a little dick and balls,

192
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:25,486
you know, what?

193
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,461
You know how I feel about balls?

194
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,594
They make me go...

195
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:33,624
Oh.

196
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:42,082
Little cuties.

197
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,998
Love 'em.

198
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:48,088
Because dicks don't
gotta say nothing.

199
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,090
But balls have to have
all the personality.

200
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:03,668
Gay men... growing up, I
remember gay men are like women.

201
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,846
Hm.

202
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,065
Have you ever watched
two dudes fuck?

203
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,854
It's not so much a female thing.

204
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:22,818
There's not a titty to
be sucked, you know?

205
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:26,996
It's not a clit
to be rubbed, OK?

206
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,216
There's two dicks
in that situation,

207
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,913
and presumably, four balls.

208
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:37,877
And man.

209
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:41,619
Homophobia is the
lamest, most transparent

210
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,925
form of hate I can think of.

211
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,259
When someone's homophobic,
they're just admitting,

212
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,720
they think about gay
shit all the time.

213
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:04,338
Homophobia is like when
someone farts and immediately

214
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:05,817
blames it on someone else.

215
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,106
But we all know
that he who smelt it

216
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:35,036
is curious about hooking
up with another dude.

217
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:38,459
And that is fine.

218
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:39,489
It's healthy.

219
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:47,337
Oh, yes.

220
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:48,368
OK.

221
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:49,905
Y'all know Lil
Wayne's "Lollipop?"

222
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,256
OK.

223
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,781
So like, I don't mean to
disparage my future very

224
00:15:56,912 --> 00:16:00,437
close friend, OK?

225
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,745
I just think he would dig
me, you know what I mean?

226
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,052
We'd like, see eye to eye.

227
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,782
Because I believe we
are the same height.

228
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,015
Which means we could easily
fuck standing up, just saying,

229
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,712
any way.

230
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,540
Any old way.

231
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:19,108
I got to tell you,
this is how "Lollipop"

232
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,544
begins on Tha Carter III.

233
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:27,073
[boop sounds] No homo.

234
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:32,238
Huh?

235
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,212
Yeah.

236
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,822
No homo?

237
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,999
Uh... I didn't say homo.

238
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:47,441
Yeah, no, I didn't bring
up the concept of one man

239
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,921
choking on another man's cock.

240
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:50,952
You did.

241
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,417
And then you wrote
poetry about it.

242
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,501
Gay women, there is no joke.

243
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,547
They won.

244
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:10,507
They beat the simulation.

245
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,770
It's two out of two,
superior, complex partners.

246
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:13,801
They did it.

247
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:21,301
Any menial task a lesbian
needs for me, I do.

248
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,800
I'm like, you need me
to move this table?

249
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:26,045
I got it.

250
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,135
I put dicks in my mouth.

251
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:33,835
We don't... No.

252
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:34,575
Stop.

253
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:35,605
I got it.

254
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:42,974
I have to admit.

255
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,846
I have a cis male partner.

256
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:47,066
Ew.

257
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,415
Just kidding.

258
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:49,285
He's wonderful.

259
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,592
I fucking love him.

260
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,420
Oh, love him.

261
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,450
Love him.

262
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:55,857
He holds the key to my heart.

263
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:56,684
I do this on him.

264
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,555
I put my butt up on him.

265
00:17:58,686 --> 00:17:59,295
I'm just like, hey.

266
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,035
I'm like a dog.

267
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,066
Butt up on him.

268
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:01,732
Love him.

269
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:04,692
Delish.

270
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:06,607
But there's something
I can't get used

271
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,193
to about being married
to this person,

272
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:10,959
and that is the word husband.

273
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,439
I'm like, hey, nice to meet you.

274
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:13,483
This is my husband.

275
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:19,924
[laughter]

276
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,536
Maybe husband.

277
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,580
No.

278
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:24,320
He is my husband.

279
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,670
I just... no.

280
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:27,701
Sorry.

281
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:28,658
Nothing.

282
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,372
And I'm a wife?

283
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,678
What?

284
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:36,245
I don't think so.

285
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:37,116
Really?

286
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:40,075
You sure?

287
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,121
Husband just sounds
like WASP drag

288
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:44,906
coming out of this Jewy mouth.

289
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:49,563
I'm like, oh, my husband, mmhm.

290
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:53,958
Yes, my husband and I, we
took a little ride upstate

291
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:56,918
to Bedford to review
some property,

292
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,789
but nothing quite suited us.

293
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,820
No.

294
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:04,926
Oh, don't worry.

295
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,101
We'll find something.

296
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,516
And of course, there's
always the estate.

297
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,440
So.

298
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,592
Husband also sounds like,
I really need my husband

299
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,898
to please sign
this paperwork so I

300
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,465
can finally get a credit card.

301
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,256
So I prefer the term partner.

302
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:34,695
But we are both Jewish.

303
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,176
So people mistake us for
lawyers all the time.

304
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:47,838
My partner is the first
pussy-loving straight dude

305
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:51,842
that I ever lived
with, um, after my dad.

306
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,587
Our parents have
sexualities too.

307
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,810
Yeah.

308
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,788
I lived with my best friend,
Matt, who's a gay dude,

309
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:08,119
for like 10 years before I
moved in with my partner.

310
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,602
And obviously, it was perfect.

311
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,867
And then when I moved in
with my husband I was like,

312
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:19,261
is this even going
to be fun, even?

313
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:39,847
I felt so claustrophobic.

314
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:43,677
I was like, and where
am I supposed to cry?

315
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:49,073
I was hiding in
the bathroom like...

316
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:52,686
No, no, I'm just...

317
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:56,951
Taking a very long,
very painful dump.

318
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,133
Oh.

319
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:10,399
And now I'm just, um, cleaning
up the disastrous mess.

320
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,457
But then it started.

321
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,676
We found a groove.

322
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,766
Thank God.

323
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:33,204
Honestly, it took like six
months, but something clicked.

324
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:37,470
And it just became a
sleepover with my best

325
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,907
friend where our parents
were never coming home.

326
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:51,353
Houston, please do not tell
my feminist friends this, OK?

327
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,137
But I enjoy making
a house a home.

328
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:59,013
I love it.

329
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:01,494
I love like, setting a
vibe, you know what I mean?

330
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:02,930
I like, light a little candle.

331
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm like, whoo.

332
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:06,194
Yes.

333
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,065
I pick up a dust
bunny, throw it out.

334
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,197
Taking care of business.

335
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,242
Yeah.

336
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,810
Light some incense, I'm like,
mm, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe,

337
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:14,985
vibe.

338
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,683
It's a bit too aromatic.

339
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,554
So I'm just like,
OK, perfect balance.

340
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,381
Yes, yes, yes.

341
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:22,210
Yes.

342
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,221
I'm like, peeling a carrot
over the garbage can.

343
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:24,734
I'm like, I'm a wife.

344
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:30,000
[laughter]

345
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,133
I peel it into a nub and
have to throw it out.

346
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,178
Oof.

347
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,209
I'm not a chef.

348
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:49,498
But one of my favorite things
about living with this man

349
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:56,505
is that his razors are in the
shower waiting for me to use.

350
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:57,536
Damn.

351
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,903
Men's razors are superior
to women's razors.

352
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:11,651
It's almost like it
was designed that way.

353
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,003
No.

354
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:17,033
They wouldn't do that.

355
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,883
Hm.

356
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,276
Yeah.

357
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,366
Men's razors are just
excellent quality.

358
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:33,542
The metal is like
military-grade.

359
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,634
Women's razors are so flimsy.

360
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:41,202
The slightest breeze
sends them flying

361
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,452
off the shelf of the shower.

362
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:50,429
And someone decided about
six, seven years ago,

363
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,651
to line the perimeter of women's
razors with soap and rubber.

364
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,198
Houston, let me
ask you something.

365
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:02,876
Be real with me.

366
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:06,445
Do I look too dumb
to lather my own leg?

367
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,537
OK.

368
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:15,018
Let me ask you another thing.

369
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:21,460
After one shower, doesn't the
soap become the texture of cum?

370
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:36,475
I'm getting in the shower
to rub cum all over my legs?

371
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,565
Why do you think I got in
here in the first place?

372
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:51,533
And the rubber on women's razors
protrudes past the blade, such

373
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:54,405
that I'm press, press,
pressing down to get

374
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,656
to the base of the follicle.

375
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,368
Like, can I let
you know if I want

376
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,804
to bowl with bumpers today?

377
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:06,578
Jesus.

378
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:13,773
And the area that men
are expected to shave.

379
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,078
This.

380
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:18,560
The, um... the saddle.

381
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:35,534
The saddle is like 12
to 15 square inches max.

382
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,017
Compared to all
this surface area?

383
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,063
Come on.

384
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:47,763
It takes me like 40 minutes
to shave my legs proper.

385
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,854
I could have watched two
episodes of "Broad City."

386
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,516
Oh, man.

387
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:04,301
I have a disgusting
little fantasy

388
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:07,304
I'm going to share with you.

389
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:15,435
The fantasy is that I pay a man
to shave my legs for me weekly.

390
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:25,235
Well, here's how it goes, OK?

391
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:29,065
So I set a standing
appointment on Fridays.

392
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:33,722
I do it around 1:30, so I'm
always taking a half day.

393
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:36,986
I'mma let you guys know I have
that personal appointment.

394
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:37,857
I gotta go.

395
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:38,945
Yeah.

396
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:40,250
Email me or text me.

397
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:44,690
I'll see you on Monday.

398
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,606
And I go right into the
most progressive barbershop

399
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,390
in Brooklyn.

400
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,454
I'm like, ding a ling a ling.

401
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,522
Mario, hi.

402
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,742
Mwah.

403
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:57,224
We have like a cute-ass
rapport by this point.

404
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:59,226
And I hike up my
little dress and I

405
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:02,838
sit in his barber chair like
Mork from "Mork and Mindy."

406
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,326
OK.

407
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,328
So like, Mario, is
not like, skimping

408
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,658
out on me because I'm a woman.

409
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,374
You know?

410
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:20,203
He's not like, giving me shitty
service because it's my legs.

411
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,640
He totally cares.

412
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,251
He's an artisan, OK?

413
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:27,907
He puts hot towels on my
legs, opening up the pores,

414
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:30,344
steaming beach towels, y'all.

415
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:40,615
And Mario freehands a straight
razor, ankle to damn pussy,

416
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:41,646
all right?

417
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:51,626
He stops right at the crease,
because he is a professional.

418
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,112
So women's razors are trash.

419
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:00,417
We've decided.

420
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:03,420
It's been decided.

421
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:07,163
But there are some products
for women that I appreciate.

422
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:09,078
One of those products
is a diva cup.

423
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:23,876
So a diva cup is a
reusable period receptacle.

424
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:27,880
It is a little rubber cup.

425
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,796
But it doesn't
have a flat bottom.

426
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:36,453
The silhouette is that of
a long titty bent over.

427
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,590
It comes to a long, soft point.

428
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,338
And the way you use it
is that you bend the cup

429
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:55,211
and fold it like a tiny
little piece of pizza.

430
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:02,044
And you put it at the
base of your vagina.

431
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,263
And you go...

432
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:04,293
[breathing]

433
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:15,057
And you wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

434
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:16,755
You relax and receive.

435
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,020
You do not block, OK?

436
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:28,114
And once it's up far
enough, it goes...

437
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:30,290
[pop]

438
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,075
Out to its original shape.

439
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:34,106
And...

440
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:34,860
[pop]

441
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,252
Suctions to the cervix.

442
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:50,745
And bitch, I promise you.

443
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:55,924
Your uterine lining is slip
slide dancing all the way down.

444
00:29:58,971 --> 00:29:59,871
Splashing about.

445
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:07,196
And the way you use
it throughout the day

446
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:13,507
is that you find yourself a
single occupancy bathroom.

447
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:14,725
Can't stress that enough.

448
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:19,984
Learn from my mistakes, OK?

449
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:26,302
And you pull your pants down.

450
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:30,654
And you bear down just
enough to give a slow birth

451
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:32,178
to a little rubber cup.

452
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:38,488
But not enough to poop.

453
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,669
So you grab it.

454
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,326
And then you go, oh my God.

455
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:51,357
What?

456
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,157
And you waddle up to the sink.

457
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:03,426
And you dump it.

458
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:05,037
And you go...

459
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,299
[shuddering noises]

460
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:09,984
Whoa.

461
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:14,307
And you rinse and repeat.

462
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:15,337
Simple.

463
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:27,146
I am ashamed to admit this.

464
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:31,759
But for the first few
months of using my diva cup,

465
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,067
I would use it only at home.

466
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:37,417
And my husband would
put it in for me.

467
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,988
He's that kind of dude.

468
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:45,773
He's that kind of man.

469
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,906
Loves pussy, I guess, too.

470
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:50,734
That doesn't hurt.

471
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:51,953
He was like, baby, chill.

472
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:53,041
Chill.

473
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:55,696
Relax and receive,
baby, ow, my shoulder.

474
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:56,827
I was like, oh, fuck.

475
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,066
I don't know about this, man.

476
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,873
Shit.
Stop.

477
00:31:59,004 --> 00:31:59,904
Stop.
No.

478
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,093
Go.
Just keep going.

479
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:01,876
Sorry.
Oh, where's it going to go?

480
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:02,907
Oh.

481
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:10,363
Where did I think
it was going to go?

482
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:13,714
[wet sounds]

483
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:14,744
It's gone.

484
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:21,243
We're not able to relocate the...

485
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:30,470
We've lost, um... an hour
later, I'm like, see?

486
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,500
You see?

487
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:41,742
What a fucking baby I was.

488
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:45,311
I needed my daddy to put my
little diva cup in for me.

489
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:54,494
Even though it's so intense, I
prefer a diva cup to a tampon.

490
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,800
Tampons hurt.

491
00:32:56,931 --> 00:33:00,500
Cotton is so dry.

492
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,241
That's like, its whole thing.

493
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:14,253
And I'm going to put that in
my delicious, juicy pussy?

494
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:17,038
Get out of here.

495
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:24,176
I've never taken a tampon
out without going...

496
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:25,206
Ow.

497
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,843
And the thing we
all know about pads

498
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:42,150
is that they're very insulting.

499
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:50,811
Do I look like a baby
in a diapie to you?

500
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:53,205
Is that what I look like?

501
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:59,037
A frustrated infant
sitting in my stuff?

502
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,647
It's not like pads work.

503
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,301
You know what I mean?

504
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:05,304
There's no like, pad technology
that whisks away the...

505
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,653
No.
No.

506
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:07,683
It just sits there.

507
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,443
Magnetic force pulls the stuff...

508
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:15,749
Nope.

509
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:16,967
It just sits there.

510
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:29,719
My last ditch effort with pads,
as though I owed them anything,

511
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:34,246
were to make them
my overnight plan.

512
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:39,294
So I would find my most
stretched out, faded,

513
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:47,425
holey, stained pair of
underwear, balled up

514
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:55,049
in the corner of the
closet from last month,

515
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,095
slap a fattie on that thang.

516
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:09,150
And just in case, I would
lay a towel down, like I'm

517
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,109
a dog coming in from the rain.

518
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,048
And I'm like, this is good.

519
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,813
This is going to be good.

520
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:23,295
All taken care of.

521
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,775
Until a trickle, trickle,
trickle is just leaking

522
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:26,950
out the side, all night.

523
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:28,517
Leaking out the
side onto my thigh.

524
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:30,084
All night.

525
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:31,651
Because remember,
it doesn't work.

526
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:38,179
Meanwhile, the weight
of my top thigh

527
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,705
is crush, crush,
crushing the pad,

528
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:45,143
such that the sticky
is sticking to itself.

529
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:52,759
And it gets stuck right
here, in the barber's crease.

530
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:03,900
Like, hey, are we testing
these products for you?

531
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:06,381
Are these to market yet, or?

532
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,474
So.

533
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:15,956
Suffice it to say, that's
why I prefer a diva cup.

534
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:25,531
There's something that doesn't
feel totally cohesive about it

535
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:28,534
to me.

536
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:33,887
And that's that I can't think
of an action, nor a product,

537
00:36:34,017 --> 00:36:38,196
that is less diva-like.

538
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,937
You know, I can't
picture J-Lo like,

539
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,113
bending and folding
and searching

540
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,898
for a single occupancy bathroom.

541
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:46,813
Please, it's an emergency.

542
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:47,843
Please, please.

543
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,255
Mariah Carey is like,
clutching her diva cup,

544
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,344
waddling in stripper
heels to the sink.

545
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,334
No.

546
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:05,658
Celine Dion's bearing down
just the right amount.

547
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:06,702
She's like,

548
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,705
[singing impression]

549
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:10,736
Oh, shit.

550
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,044
It happens.

551
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:26,156
My mom told me that pads
used to have belts on them.

552
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,553
A pad and then a belt?

553
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:35,717
Yeah.

554
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:43,391
I am grateful to
be a woman in 2019.

555
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:48,614
It is the best it's been yet.

556
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:50,050
Oh.

557
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,080
Bummer.

558
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,534
No, we're really
grateful to be here.

559
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:57,338
Thank you, [SILLY VOICE]
so much for having us,

560
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,494
I'm so happy to be here!

561
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,236
Thank you, thank you
so much for having us!

562
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,281
Oh, no.

563
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:04,651
Forget the thing I said before.

564
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:13,552
It's a good time to be
a Jewish woman in 2019.

565
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:18,905
Except that the Nazis
are making a comeback.

566
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:24,258
Nazis are so annoying.

567
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:25,868
They're so pesky.

568
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:34,181
But the Nazis in this
country, I don't know,

569
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,140
they're no Hitler's Nazis.

570
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:41,754
And I know.

571
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:45,758
I grew up studying the
Holocaust in Hebrew school.

572
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:46,788
Against my will.

573
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,720
They were real intense about it.

574
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:58,771
They showed us a lot
of stuff real young.

575
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:01,774
Footage of the
trains, and pictures

576
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:07,432
of the mountains of glasses
and piles of dead people's

577
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:11,349
shoes and dead bodies.

578
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,438
They were like, never forget.

579
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:19,618
I was like, I can't.

580
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:20,648
I'm six.

581
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:31,020
It was fear mongering
up in my shul.

582
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:34,763
Dudes, you are not going
to believe this story

583
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:35,794
I'm about to tell you.

584
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,810
Get ready, dawgs.

585
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,854
Fuck.

586
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,421
OK.

587
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:45,295
In Hebrew school, we did
a weeks-long simulation

588
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:52,302
of escaping the Holocaust to
try to get to the New World.

589
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,219
Yeah.

590
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,352
As a kid I LARPed the Holocaust.

591
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:04,967
Swear to God.

592
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,491
Swear to her.

593
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:09,842
My parents paid good money
for me to do Holocaust play.

594
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:19,373
I guess there wasn't enough
real, imminent danger for

595
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:22,942
Jewish children in Long Island.

596
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,858
So we got to create it.

597
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,337
Huh?

598
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,861
Yeah.

599
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:32,386
The kids who were already
bar and bat mitzvah'd

600
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,301
got to play the
role of the guards.

601
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:40,655
And we would trade
pennies and pretzels

602
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,876
to get to the next level.

603
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:49,403
It was just a series of
dimly lit hallways, OK.

604
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:52,624
But we end up at a wedding
in the Jewish ghetto.

605
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:59,587
Education.

606
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:01,546
And we're all like,
[speaking hebrew]..

607
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:13,427
When suddenly, the lights
start flashing on and off.

608
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,473
And we hear...
Where are the Jews?

609
00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:17,562
And we were like, [screaming].

610
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:26,135
And I shit you not.

611
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:31,314
After three minutes of children
screaming, the lights turn on,

612
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:32,405
and my teacher's like...

613
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,496
You thought you'd escape?

614
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:46,199
Not such luck, my little Jews.

615
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,813
So it's fully psycho.

616
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:52,901
Yeah, nuts.

617
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:54,294
What is that?

618
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:57,863
But also, I'm like, I guess
they kind of had a point?

619
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:00,213
Because they are
back in a big way.

620
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:09,614
But the Nazis in our
country are such a mess.

621
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,530
Like, their branding
is very loose.

622
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:21,408
Like, they don't even have
like, a look, you know?

623
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,659
They have that red hat, but.

624
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:32,114
They really just
look like a bunch

625
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:34,552
of golfers who've been sitting
in the sun for too long.

626
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:41,863
And their merch is
from Party City?

627
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:44,344
I'm like, I could have picked
up a dozen tiki torches.

628
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:47,826
I'm not impressed by you.

629
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:54,484
But Hitler's Nazis, if
we're comparing Nazis,

630
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:55,515
they were on point.

631
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:02,928
They just had so
much art direction.

632
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:05,931
Like, brand concept meeting
after brand concept meeting,

633
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:09,804
after brand concept meeting.

634
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:13,765
Do you know that the
Nazi costume was designed

635
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:16,158
by Hugo Boss of Macy's fame?

636
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,468
Yeah.

637
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,864
And like, I admired Hugo
Boss clothing as a kid?

638
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:27,605
Like, it was legit.

639
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:28,997
I'd go to the mall with my mom.

640
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:30,671
And we would pass the
Hugo Boss display.

641
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:32,566
And I'd be like,
I don't know, mom.

642
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,873
I feel like a Hugo Boss
button down would be pretty

643
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:36,123
cool for the chorus concert.

644
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,010
I just, I mean, they just
were so creative about it.

645
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:45,492
They were so enthusiastic.

646
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:52,717
I feel like Hitler's Nazis liked
the production of a Holocaust

647
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,240
more than they even hated Jews.

648
00:43:57,243 --> 00:44:00,594
I think they liked
the buzz, you know?

649
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:01,987
The meetings.

650
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:03,815
And they were always
whispering about shit

651
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:08,297
and creating like a secret
coded language and shit.

652
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:11,823
And they would write essays
and write whole books and film

653
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:14,477
and document, and they would
like have little clipboards

654
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:16,528
and run around town like
putting up their flyers.

655
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,351
They're like, yeah,
meeting's tonight.

656
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:21,484
Be there or be square.

657
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:22,592
I drew that.
That Jewish rat?

658
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:23,573
I drew that.
Yeah.

659
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:24,604
Shading.
Check it out.

660
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:33,801
Like the Nazis acted
like they hated us.

661
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:38,850
But I'm like, y'all
were obsessed with us.

662
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,859
The Nazis were totally
gay for the Jews.

663
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:56,128
Starting off with over the
knee patent leather boots.

664
00:44:56,258 --> 00:45:00,088
I'm like, someone's putting
fashion before function, OK?

665
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:07,443
They're cutting off
their knee mobility

666
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:10,185
to gestapo around town?

667
00:45:10,316 --> 00:45:13,319
They're like, no,
it's totally worth it.

668
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:14,349
They look so cool.

669
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:24,547
I mean, if I were to
gestapo around town,

670
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:27,072
I'm not cutting off the knee.

671
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,770
I wouldn't even
cut off the ankle.

672
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:32,991
I would do like
a low rise cleat.

673
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:35,689
For like gripping
the cobblestones.

674
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,995
And also like, power.

675
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,025
You know?

676
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:45,394
That walk.

677
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:50,486
I just, if you were to say to
me, Ilana, come at me, bro.

678
00:45:50,617 --> 00:45:54,273
Like a, you fucking hate me.

679
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:56,710
And b, oh, you're going
to fucking kill me.

680
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,021
I would lead with the
head and shoulders.

681
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:05,545
I'd give you a fucking
mean fucking look.

682
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:09,636
I'd be like, I want to
be as ugly as possible.

683
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,506
And, oh shit.

684
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:11,769
I'm lifting the knees.

685
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:13,335
Like, I'm coming at you, bitch.

686
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:14,366
Watch the fuck out.

687
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:21,213
Not Hitler's Nazis.

688
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:22,823
No, no.

689
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:25,913
They preferred a leg
extension and a leg extension,

690
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:30,657
and a leg extension,
and a leg extension, oh.

691
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,573
Ice queen all day.

692
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,270
Serving Aryan apathy.

693
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:36,489
They don't care.

694
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:38,012
They don't fucking care.

695
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,022
They figured out the gay
haircuts 70 years in advance.

696
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:50,242
How'd they do that?

697
00:46:50,372 --> 00:46:52,026
Did the Nazis have
a time machine?

698
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:53,419
Honestly.

699
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:55,769
They like, time travel to
2015 Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

700
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,032
They were like, oh, shit, bitch.

701
00:46:58,163 --> 00:46:59,294
This is it.

702
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,209
Yeah.

703
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,646
Oh.

704
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:06,171
We're going tight on the
sides and long on top, boys.

705
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,955
Let's go.

706
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:08,986
Oh.

707
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:15,317
You see how it flows on top and
then stays neat on the sides?

708
00:47:15,397 --> 00:47:16,297
I love that.

709
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,447
You look wunderbar, Rolf.

710
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:22,477
Oh.

711
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:33,807
Sometimes I wonder what might
have happened if there was

712
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:36,679
some sort of Grindr back then.

713
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:43,338
Like, maybe we should make
some sort of neo-Nazi Grindr

714
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:44,369
app tonight.

715
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:50,215
Although my brother
Elliott tells me

716
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:53,740
that's kind of what
Grindr is already, so.

717
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,524
Oh.

718
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:57,178
Yeah.

719
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:01,443
That hate shows up in the
most surprising of spaces.

720
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:04,316
You know, I grew up thinking
there were progressive spaces

721
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:05,752
and then conservative spaces.

722
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,145
But it's all a fucking mess.

723
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,280
Like New York is so liberal.

724
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:13,847
Mm-mm.

725
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,893
It's fucking racist
and misogynist

726
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:18,678
and terrifying at times.

727
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:21,420
Hollywood's so progressive.

728
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,248
OK.

729
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:26,381
If Hollywood is so progressive,
why is Mel Gibson still here?

730
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:32,953
Get outta here, Mel, come on.

731
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:36,609
Mel Gibson has said
terrifying things

732
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:44,399
publicly about black
people, women, Jews.

733
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:49,535
I'm like, who do you think did
your deal for Daddy's Home 2?

734
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:52,581
Australians?

735
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:54,235
Jews, baby.

736
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:55,802
Jews.

737
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,736
They're up in there,
fighting for your back end.

738
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,660
What are you doing?

739
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,508
Mel Gibson was once
recorded calling

740
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:14,639
his ex-wife a glum cunt for not
sucking his dick in a hot tub.

741
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:22,089
Sweet baby Mel, let
me tell you something.

742
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:28,530
Melly, Melly G, you can't
suck a dick underwater.

743
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:31,751
It doesn't work.

744
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:33,840
There's no suction.

745
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:34,972
It's like... [sounds].

746
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:39,193
Also, a girl would drown.

747
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:54,426
Mel Gibson has eight movies
in production this year.

748
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,344
I love that face.

749
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:01,302
Oh, no.

750
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:02,129
Yeah.

751
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:02,912
IMDB.

752
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:03,943
Shit.

753
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:09,789
I just won't be seeing
any of them, I guess.

754
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:12,226
You know, I haven't...

755
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:13,595
Have I ever seen a
Mel Gibson movie?

756
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,969
I hope not.

757
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,625
I haven't seen "Braveheart."

758
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:20,669
I get it already.

759
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,585
I know what "Braveheart"
is, you know?

760
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:25,631
Mel Gibson plays like a...

761
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:27,067
White warrior.

762
00:50:32,899 --> 00:50:33,799
Painted blue.

763
00:50:37,512 --> 00:50:38,412
Wow.

764
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:43,344
You want to see "Braveheart"?

765
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:44,635
This is fucking "Braveheart".

766
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:52,005
[screaming]

767
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,398
You just watched "Braveheart."

768
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:56,227
That's it.

769
00:50:56,357 --> 00:51:00,535
I just saved you two
hours and 58 minutes.

770
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,711
So humble of them not to
hit the three hour mark.

771
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:09,694
I just feel like I don't
have to see the classics.

772
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:11,068
I fucking get it.

773
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:13,722
They're the patriarchy
reduced to two hours.

774
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:14,854
I've seen them all.

775
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,247
You know?

776
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:18,466
I'm like, do I ever have
to see "Casablanca"?

777
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:20,164
Must I?

778
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:21,991
I get it already.

779
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:25,256
"Casablanca" is
like, title card.

780
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:31,871
And some baseball glove-looking
dude has a much younger,

781
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,960
much hotter girlfriend.

782
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,571
And he's like, here's
looking at you, kid.

783
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:37,602
Roll credits.

784
00:51:37,703 --> 00:51:38,356
Yikes.

785
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:39,406
OK, I've seen this one.

786
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:40,387
I get it.

787
00:51:43,274 --> 00:51:45,232
I've never seen "Star Wars".

788
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:46,263
Oh.

789
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:50,063
I get it.

790
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:53,327
There is a war in the stars.

791
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:01,944
From my understanding, it is
very soft, very titillating

792
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,511
brother-sister incest porn.

793
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:11,911
And then they have
the gall to make

794
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,000
the blackest guy in
the galaxy, Darth

795
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,612
Vader, an absentee father.

796
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:18,396
Yeah.

797
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:19,179
No thanks.

798
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,006
I've seen this one.

799
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,486
Thanks.

800
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:22,356
Hard pass.

801
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:23,531
Yeah.

802
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:25,422
Maybe we should burn it
down and start fresh.

803
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,407
I'm trying.

804
00:52:29,537 --> 00:52:31,104
You know, I try.

805
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:33,672
I'm in this industry
of film and TV.

806
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:37,241
And I have no references beyond
"Get Out" and "Hey Arnold."

807
00:52:41,723 --> 00:52:42,333
I'm an idiot.

808
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:43,203
Really.

809
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:43,943
I'm a dumb dumb.

810
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:47,512
I don't know what's up.

811
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:51,559
So I watched "Rear
Window" recently.

812
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,734
It was fine.

813
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:56,782
It was interesting.

814
00:52:56,912 --> 00:53:01,482
But there was one thing
I could not get past.

815
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:06,357
And that was Grace
Kelly's tiny little voice.

816
00:53:09,534 --> 00:53:10,434
Ooh.

817
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:14,612
Ah.

818
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:19,935
Oh.

819
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:23,635
I was like, what, bitch?

820
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:25,376
Speak up.

821
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:27,378
Yeah, I can't hear you, bitch.

822
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:28,408
Louder.

823
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:30,598
I want to hear
what you're saying.

824
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:32,034
No, no.

825
00:53:32,165 --> 00:53:33,558
Mm-mm.

826
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:36,822
This voice was designed.

827
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:40,217
This voice is perfectly
received by the male eardrum.

828
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:45,004
Never too high.

829
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,223
She's not a shrill bitch.

830
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:52,054
And never too low.

831
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:53,230
You know what that means.

832
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,971
It's not that.

833
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:57,002
Never that.

834
00:54:00,628 --> 00:54:05,503
You could hear the spittle
on her wet baby lips.

835
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:12,988
She sounded as though
a doe was suddenly

836
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,251
given the ability to speak.

837
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:22,171
And all the women at this
time sounded this way.

838
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:24,478
You know, like Audrey Hepburn.

839
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:27,525
And you know, I like,
love Audrey Hepburn too.

840
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:28,555
Or whatever.

841
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:31,311
But they sounded
the same exact way.

842
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:32,636
You know, like,
I guess they went

843
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,533
to like the same finishing
school to learn how

844
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:38,884
to walk and talk like a lady.

845
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:47,414
All the consonants
were stretched out.

846
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:56,641
And the vowels never
quite found their shape.

847
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:17,966
They always sounded like,
oh, everything's wonderful.

848
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,712
Isn't it wonderful?

849
00:55:24,843 --> 00:55:25,743
Everything?

850
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:34,200
This world that men
have designed for us.

851
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,377
They're very clever, those men.

852
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:38,588
You have to give them that.

853
00:55:41,512 --> 00:55:48,475
So I recently found out
why these classic beauties

854
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:50,434
sounded like this in
these classic films.

855
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:58,659
And it's because when they
would come in for an audition,

856
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:05,187
the old Hollywood director would
jizz right in their mouths.

857
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:14,109
And if the young starlet were
lucky enough to get the part,

858
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,548
she'd have to keep it in her
mouth for the whole shoot.

859
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,857
Oh.

860
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:24,032
Terrible.

861
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:25,382
Awful.

862
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:26,948
Imagine that.

863
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:32,606
A Dixie cup's worth of jizz
being stored in your cheeks

864
00:56:32,737 --> 00:56:36,175
like chipmunks for upwards
of 40 business days.

865
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:37,205
No.

866
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:44,183
Oh, can you picture having
to spit out a load at night

867
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:47,447
into a shot glass and put
it back in before hair

868
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:48,709
and makeup in the morning?

869
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,740
No.

870
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:54,019
Terrible.

871
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:55,049
Oh.

872
00:56:58,502 --> 00:56:59,870
Now I guess we know
why their mouths

873
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:01,156
are always in that shape.

874
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:02,187
Oh.

875
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:09,251
Ah.

876
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:09,991
Oh.

877
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:11,022
Mm-hmm.

878
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:14,431
Finishing school indeed.

879
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:19,857
Terrible.

880
00:57:19,914 --> 00:57:20,814
Awful.

881
00:57:24,571 --> 00:57:28,836
I am grateful for my
foremothers who came

882
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:30,664
before me in this industry.

883
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:32,955
You know, they made it a
safer place for me to work in.

884
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:38,528
And I'm excited.

885
00:57:38,629 --> 00:57:40,282
I'm fucking jazzed
about the momentum

886
00:57:40,413 --> 00:57:41,588
women are gaining right now.

887
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:44,069
I think we're close, you know.

888
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:46,375
Me Too and Time's Up.

889
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:49,204
Women are taking a
giant step forward

890
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:50,641
in a cute fucking wedge.

891
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:56,821
And we're close, y'all.

892
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:58,649
We are so close.

893
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,738
I think we are so close
to taking it back.
