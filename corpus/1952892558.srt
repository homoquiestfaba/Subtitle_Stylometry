1
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:52,790
My mother never told me
about her parents.

2
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:56,511
She regretted having to hide
such a pretty Russian name like Milla

3
00:00:56,591 --> 00:01:00,312
between the ones
her foster family gave her.

4
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,511
But she told me the past
was another country now,

5
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,832
best forgotten.

6
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:10,071
It was in her nature to grow away
from the motherland,

7
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:13,432
just as it was in my nature
to grow away from her.

8
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:19,432
Sometimes I wish
I could go back myself,

9
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:24,352
to warn her that it wouldn't
be so easy, so simple...

10
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,073
that just because you're through
with your past

11
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,793
doesn't always mean
your past is ever

12
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:31,392
really through with you.

13
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:21,854
Yeah, what time is it over there?

14
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,894
No.

15
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:26,134
That's fine.

16
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,175
No. No, not yet.

17
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:29,894
Yeah, is Emily there?

18
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:32,416
Put her on, please.

19
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:35,015
Hey, sweetheart.

20
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:38,496
Yeah, Russia's...

21
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,615
Russia's beautiful...

22
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:42,096
kind of.

23
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:44,576
I'm... Well, I don't now just yet.

24
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:45,896
A couple of days.

25
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:48,736
What do you mean?

26
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:50,496
What, with Alex?
I thought...

27
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:54,297
No, I thought you weren't
seeing him anymore.

28
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:56,896
No, I don't have an...
I don't have an issue with him.

29
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,337
It's just...
Can you let me finish? Okay?

30
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,096
I don't have an issue with him.

31
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:04,137
It's just that I don't
want him staying over.

32
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:07,616
No, I don't care
what you guys do

33
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:10,338
in your own time,
just not in my house.

34
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,898
Hey, mind your language!

35
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:16,378
Yeah, because he's five
fucking years older than you!

36
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:17,898
Well, of course it's my business.

37
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:20,018
I'm your mother.

38
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:23,098
Yeah, l...
Can you just let me finish?

39
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,538
Emily?

40
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,738
Shit.

41
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,142
Mr. Misharin?

42
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,983
- I'm, uh, Marie...
- Marie Jones from America.

43
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:42,983
It's nice to meet you.

44
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:44,783
Nice to meet you, finally.

45
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,303
Make yourself at home.

46
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:50,743
Tea?

47
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,663
No, thanks.

48
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,983
- You produce movies, don't you?
- Yeah.

49
00:09:58,063 --> 00:09:59,903
Big movies?

50
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:02,864
Well, probably big here.

51
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:05,664
You should see my daughter.
She's very pretty, you know?

52
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:07,305
Good for the movies.

53
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,664
I'm sure she's great.

54
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:11,185
You don't sound very American.

55
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:15,184
I was born in Russia,
raised in England,

56
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,305
and divorced in the States.

57
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:20,706
But your roots are here,
aren't they?

58
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:25,586
At least what's left of them.

59
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:31,265
Your mother's death certificate.

60
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:33,905
Can you read Russian?

61
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:36,785
No.

62
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:38,106
Her name was Olga.

63
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,587
Olga Kaidanovsky.

64
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:45,106
Apparently, she was murdered
just after you were born.

65
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:48,747
I tried to dig up everything I could,
as you requested.

66
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,667
You never knew about her?

67
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,026
No.

68
00:10:55,307 --> 00:10:56,588
And my father?

69
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:03,428
Any brothers or sisters?

70
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:05,109
Sorry, no.

71
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,627
No records of anyone else.

72
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,748
Just the property you mentioned
on the phone, right?

73
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:11,627
Yeah, the Kaidanovsky place.

74
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:14,468
Now it belongs to you.

75
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:21,309
Look, I appreciate your efforts
on my behalf,

76
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,908
but it's been 40 years.

77
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,229
Forty-two.

78
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:29,190
Forty-one, if you insist on accuracy.

79
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:30,829
It's still another two days
till my birthday.

80
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,270
Yeah, so...

81
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:34,990
this is a present for you now.

82
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,750
Well...

83
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,310
Sign here, please.

84
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:51,470
Look, I didn't come
all the way out here

85
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:54,790
for the real estate, Mr. Misharin.

86
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,591
I've spent half my life
knee-deep in bureaucracy

87
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,791
trying to find my parents.

88
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:01,551
I've looked around, trust me,

89
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,710
but no one ever told me
a damn thing.

90
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,831
It was like
they never existed.

91
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,232
Our country has been
through a lot, Ms. Jones.

92
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,471
Governments change.

93
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:13,192
Things gets lost.
Sometimes people get lost.

94
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:14,993
So how did you find me?

95
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:19,314
I got your phone
from the Moscow office.

96
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,913
Took me six months.

97
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:24,394
You know, adoption was
a tricky business in the '60s.

98
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,684
Please.
I'm sorry.

99
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,124
I just... I don't...

100
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:32,684
I don't understand you.

101
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:37,885
You'll find this town
is not much good for postcards.

102
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,485
I didn't hear you pull up.

103
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:44,285
You must be Anatoliy.

104
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,886
You said 8:00 on the phone.

105
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:48,606
Right.

106
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,205
I can pay you now if you want.

107
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:55,886
It's impossible to go at night.

108
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,886
They think we'll die out there.

109
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:04,886
But I'd rather be dead
than live like them.

110
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:10,606
Is everyone is this country so friendly?

111
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:17,207
What?

112
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:09,254
Do you know anything
about my mother's place?

113
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:11,374
Kaidanovsky Farm.

114
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:13,374
They call it "The Island".

115
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:15,934
The only way to get there
is by a bridge.

116
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:18,415
A river surrounds it...

117
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:19,694
in a circle.

118
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:22,854
Great.

119
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:27,255
I can't even swim.

120
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,736
Hello? Anybody here?

121
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,578
We're almost there.

122
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,498
We already crossed the bridge.

123
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,058
I was dreaming.

124
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,258
No one has been here
for more than 40 years.

125
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,779
What do you expect
to find in those ruins?

126
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,660
I don't know.

127
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,260
Some clue perhaps,

128
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,180
something to make
sense of my life.

129
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:52,500
You really think so?

130
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:09,020
What are you doing?

131
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:11,701
You asked me to take you
to the Kaidanovsky Farm.

132
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,821
Well, here we are.

133
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:21,902
The house is just
behind those trees.

134
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:24,622
I'll go ahead
to make sure it's safe.

135
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,182
Hey, wait a minute.

136
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:28,583
The river is in flood.

137
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,581
You don't want to be
wandering around out there,

138
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:32,381
not if you can't swim.

139
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:16,105
Anatoliy?

140
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:50,627
Anatoliy?

141
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:05,067
Oh, no.

142
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:09,949
Shit.

143
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:11,989
Oh, no.

144
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:21,509
Jesus, not now.

145
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:23,669
Come on.

146
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:27,669
Shit!

147
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,110
Come on.

148
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,429
Shit!

149
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:37,269
No...

150
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:39,509
Anatoliy?

151
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:48,231
Oh, for God's sake.

152
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:10,113
Anatoliy?

153
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:14,231
Hey, where the hell are you?

154
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:52,275
Kaidanovsky.

155
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:40,078
Anyone here?

156
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,760
Hello?

157
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:04,243
Who's there?

158
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:11,727
Hey.

159
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:22,646
I'm not going to hurt you.

160
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:36,128
Oh, shit!

161
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,649
Oh, shit.

162
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:31,211
Anatoliy.

163
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,210
Wait! Come back!

164
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,257
Shit.

165
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:09,577
Hey. Please, calm down.

166
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:15,137
Just stay the fuck away.

167
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:16,898
Who the hell are you?

168
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:18,378
My name is Nicolai.

169
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,258
What are you doing?

170
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:22,739
I got you out of there.

171
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,939
You almost drowned.

172
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,059
Listen.

173
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:10,901
Who are you?

174
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:41,743
I think we are here
for the same reason.

175
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:51,544
So what else did you find
in my bag?

176
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:52,863
She's my mother.

177
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:05,425
You were adopted, weren't you?

178
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:09,585
I've been trying to find
my birth parents for years,

179
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:13,585
but it was like my records
were erased or something.

180
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:20,185
Then a week ago,
I get a call from the notary Misharin.

181
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:22,226
He gave me that.

182
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:24,105
At first I thought
it was a joke.

183
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:26,025
But it wasn't, was it?

184
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:29,307
Look, if this is
about the property,

185
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:31,187
you can keep it;
I don't want it.

186
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,946
- I thought we've been through that.
- Right.

187
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:34,466
Do we look like brother
and sister to you?

188
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:35,586
Twins, actually.

189
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:38,746
We were born the same day

190
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,786
according to your driver's license.

191
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:58,628
Don't you want to know
what happened to her?

192
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:13,188
I've been here
for a couple of days now.

193
00:33:13,228 --> 00:33:15,388
You were lucky I found you.

194
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:19,108
Another few minutes and that
would have been a different story.

195
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:24,310
I saw something here
when I first arrived.

196
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,190
What?

197
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,910
Hey.

198
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,190
Come on.

199
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,511
Are you okay?

200
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:42,552
Yeah.

201
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,110
Our mother was stabbed here.

202
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,191
Look. Old blood.

203
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:09,952
Did Misharin tell you
anything else?

204
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:11,552
About what?

205
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,392
Our father, maybe.

206
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:17,152
Look, I know about
as much as you do, okay?

207
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:20,033
There's men's clothes
in the other closet.

208
00:34:20,113 --> 00:34:21,673
See?

209
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:23,954
Our father's clothes.

210
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,194
- Let go. Jesus...
- Sorry.

211
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:32,113
He didn't say anything
about any father, okay?

212
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:33,433
In fact, he didn't mention anything

213
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:35,673
about any brothers either,
so why should I trust you?

214
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:37,634
Have you seen the cribs?

215
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:39,913
No.

216
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,274
Look.

217
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:52,393
See the name?

218
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:54,555
It's the same as the one
on your medallion.

219
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,876
Mine is on the other one.

220
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:04,876
Milla.

221
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:15,397
What were you running from
when you fell in the river?

222
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,476
I saw my...

223
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:30,917
I don't know. No.

224
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:33,798
It's okay. I'm fine.

225
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:37,038
Maybe I really am
going crazy, you know?

226
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:40,398
I'm finally crazy
after all these years.

227
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:42,478
And twin brothers?

228
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,517
Fucking Russia.

229
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:31,041
Who's Emily?

230
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:34,480
You were calling her name
in your sleep.

231
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,481
What's it to you?

232
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:50,722
Where are you going?

233
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:52,763
There's a generator
in the basement.

234
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:55,282
We've still got
a few hours before dark.

235
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:57,761
I want to get it running.

236
00:36:59,082 --> 00:37:00,403
Hey...

237
00:37:10,283 --> 00:37:12,403
We've got to get out of here.

238
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,563
We've got to find
that truck I came in.

239
00:37:14,682 --> 00:37:16,643
There are no vehicles here.
This is an island.

240
00:37:16,723 --> 00:37:18,122
So what about the bridge?

241
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:19,763
The bridge is down.

242
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:21,762
If I hadn't pulled you
out of the river,

243
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:23,243
we wouldn't be talking.

244
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,923
How long was I out for?

245
00:37:24,963 --> 00:37:26,844
Long enough to change your clothes

246
00:37:26,924 --> 00:37:28,605
and dry your hair.

247
00:37:28,684 --> 00:37:30,124
Nice tattoo, by the way.

248
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,605
Nothing creepy.

249
00:37:31,644 --> 00:37:33,485
I had to get you out
of those wet things before...

250
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:36,604
I mean, we are brother
and sister, right?

251
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:37,645
- Come on.
- Hey.

252
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:39,645
You never said
how you got here.

253
00:37:40,645 --> 00:37:42,165
I walked.

254
00:37:42,244 --> 00:37:43,285
Took me a few days.

255
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:46,126
My unit trained in this area.

256
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:07,207
See that door?

257
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:11,127
I heard something moving
back there on the first night.

258
00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:13,447
Where does that lead to?

259
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,407
I don't know.

260
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:26,608
Come on, Nicolai.
I don't like it down here.

261
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,448
Give me a minute.

262
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,249
What the hell is that?

263
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:46,729
Sounds like a truck.

264
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,649
- Jesus, it's him.
- Who?

265
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:53,489
Hey.

266
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:54,769
Hey, wait!

267
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:56,529
Wait! Marie!

268
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,571
It's Anatoliy.

269
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,610
Hey, I don't like this.
Wait a second!

270
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,450
Yeah, let my go, Nicolai.
I've had it with this shit.

271
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:10,291
The bridge is down, Marie.

272
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:12,690
Whoever that guy is,
he's part of it.

273
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,289
What do you mean?
You have a gun, don't you?

274
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:33,092
Wait!

275
00:39:34,051 --> 00:39:35,211
Hey.

276
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:39,573
Anatoliy!

277
00:39:41,053 --> 00:39:42,252
Damn.

278
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:45,612
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:46,932
Are you crazy?

280
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,613
Where the hell is it?

281
00:39:48,693 --> 00:39:50,612
You...

282
00:39:50,694 --> 00:39:52,732
You saw it too, right?

283
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:05,893
Is this what you were looking for?

284
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:18,095
This hasn't moved
anywhere for years.

285
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:25,055
This is the same truck
I came here in.

286
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:26,775
- It worked.
- Don't be silly.

287
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:28,296
It can't be the same one.

288
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,775
What was that?

289
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:22,217
Hey, these aren't animal bones.

290
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:27,458
Looks like a bullet wound.

291
00:41:27,538 --> 00:41:30,099
A shotgun maybe.

292
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:32,539
Kaidanovsky.

293
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:38,460
I think we've just found
another member of the family.

294
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:41,339
What are you doing?

295
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,980
Move away.
Get behind me.

296
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,260
What the fuck are they?

297
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:59,220
Just shoot them!
Nicolai, shoot them!

298
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,661
What are you doing?

299
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:05,300
For God's sake,
Nicolai, shoot them!

300
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:10,381
Oh, God!

301
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:16,062
- Come on, Nicolai!
- The gun.

302
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:17,622
- Get the gun!
- Okay.

303
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:22,181
Come on.

304
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:24,863
Come on!

305
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:48,824
Shit.

306
00:42:51,984 --> 00:42:53,303
Here.

307
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:56,344
- Shit.
- Where's our stuff?

308
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:59,104
The barricades.
Someone's been here.

309
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,903
Someone must have been here.

310
00:43:00,984 --> 00:43:03,945
Look, you're bleeding real bad.

311
00:43:03,986 --> 00:43:05,985
- You're bleeding real bad.
- I'm fine!

312
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:16,025
Jesus.

313
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:20,105
What were those things back there?

314
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,985
Who? Our friends?

315
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:25,145
I guess whatever...

316
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,946
whatever happened to them
happens to us.

317
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:30,186
Oh, shit.

318
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:33,506
It makes it hard
to kill them, doesn't it?

319
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:35,267
What are you talking about?

320
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,707
I saw your double
a couple of days ago.

321
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,187
When I saw the real you,
I didn't know what to believe.

322
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:46,147
Oh, my God.

323
00:43:47,188 --> 00:43:48,348
Oh, shit.

324
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,466
Mine was soaked,

325
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,626
soaked through
like I fell in the river.

326
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:56,586
Shit!

327
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,348
So you will drown, then.

328
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:02,708
They're our deaths,
Marie, our futures.

329
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:12,148
Oh, God.

330
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:18,190
We are haunting ourselves.

331
00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:23,190
Hey, what are you doing?

332
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,869
- If I die, I'm doing it my way.
- Stop! Don't!

333
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:28,390
- Don't leave me here!
- Let me go!

334
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,111
They caught you.

335
00:45:15,472 --> 00:45:16,672
Fuck!

336
00:45:21,992 --> 00:45:23,033
No.

337
00:45:23,112 --> 00:45:25,473
No fucking way.

338
00:45:25,512 --> 00:45:26,952
Come on.

339
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:31,154
Don't do this to me!

340
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:32,874
God!

341
00:45:32,954 --> 00:45:35,954
Oh, shit. Okay.

342
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,994
This is not happening
to me, right?

343
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:40,995
This is not
happening to me.

344
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:45,914
What are you looking at,
you fucking bitch?

345
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:58,355
Nicolai! Is that you?

346
00:46:01,355 --> 00:46:03,195
Are you there?

347
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,354
Nicolai, come on!
Are you there?

348
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,603
Son of a bitch.

349
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:01,646
Okay.

350
00:49:15,046 --> 00:49:16,927
Come on.

351
00:49:17,007 --> 00:49:18,927
The bridge.

352
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:23,368
Okay.

353
00:50:42,932 --> 00:50:44,091
Nicolai?

354
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:50,894
Hey.

355
00:51:27,535 --> 00:51:29,255
Is that you?

356
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:32,420
Oh, shit!

357
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:12,582
Shit.

358
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:31,946
Please.

359
00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:22,909
Bitch!

360
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,631
Oh, fuck this.

361
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:52,039
Shit.

362
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:27,401
Oh, shit!

363
01:00:12,727 --> 01:00:14,528
No.

364
01:01:06,811 --> 01:01:09,210
I knew you would turn up.

365
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,730
Don't let the decorations bother you.

366
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:24,291
I found it like this.

367
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:31,811
You're dead, Nicolai.

368
01:01:31,891 --> 01:01:34,533
You fell into a black hole.

369
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:37,492
I fell in the tunnel,
in the basement.

370
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:39,132
But it was black enough.

371
01:01:50,093 --> 01:01:53,174
You tried to cross
the river, didn't you?

372
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:54,892
Don't tell me.

373
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:56,492
You didn't get far, right?

374
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:57,973
Just who are you?

375
01:01:58,012 --> 01:01:59,652
You should be asking you
the same thing.

376
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:01,173
- I know who I am.
- Oh, no.

377
01:02:01,212 --> 01:02:03,614
You have no idea
who you really are.

378
01:02:07,534 --> 01:02:10,054
What happened to you?

379
01:02:25,735 --> 01:02:27,255
The house wants us back.

380
01:02:29,215 --> 01:02:30,415
What the hell happened here?

381
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:33,775
What did they do in this place?

382
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:36,775
You saw it, didn't you?

383
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:42,456
I saw someone upstairs,
a man, in our parents' room.

384
01:02:42,536 --> 01:02:45,696
I saw what he did to her, Nicolai.

385
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:49,376
Like watching a fucking home movie.

386
01:02:49,455 --> 01:02:52,256
We were never meant
to leave this place.

387
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:55,256
See the cake,
the decorations?

388
01:02:55,297 --> 01:02:57,216
It's our homecoming.

389
01:02:57,256 --> 01:02:59,897
We don't belong here anymore.

390
01:03:01,938 --> 01:03:05,698
Jesus, that thing tried to kill me.

391
01:03:05,778 --> 01:03:07,738
I don't think they can.

392
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,178
Not until midnight.

393
01:03:09,257 --> 01:03:12,778
Why midnight?
What happens then?

394
01:03:14,937 --> 01:03:16,258
It's our birthday.

395
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:28,138
They say when
you see yourself,

396
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:30,218
your doppelganger...

397
01:03:31,618 --> 01:03:33,979
that it's time to die.

398
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,380
What happened to you down there?

399
01:03:46,419 --> 01:03:48,979
I saw the past.

400
01:05:53,629 --> 01:05:55,187
Mama.

401
01:06:14,508 --> 01:06:16,269
Marie?

402
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,109
Marie.

403
01:06:37,509 --> 01:06:39,589
Don't go any farther.

404
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,869
What is this place?

405
01:06:47,751 --> 01:06:50,951
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes, I really want to know.

406
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:58,431
We were supposed to die
in this house in '66.

407
01:06:58,511 --> 01:07:01,233
Now our father is going
to get his wish.

408
01:07:01,312 --> 01:07:02,872
Our father?

409
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,712
Yeah, Kolya Kaidanovsky,

410
01:07:05,832 --> 01:07:07,632
the man you saw upstairs.

411
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,313
At midnight everything
will be recreated as it was

412
01:07:13,352 --> 01:07:16,072
on the night of the murders.

413
01:07:16,152 --> 01:07:19,953
Only this time, we'll die
as we were always meant to.

414
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,833
We'll become our destinies,

415
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:25,033
our doppelgangers.

416
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,513
We don't have much time.

417
01:07:41,674 --> 01:07:43,195
What is that?

418
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,755
Let's get out of here.

419
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,758
So, how do you want to spend
your last few minutes?

420
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,121
Ever been to Disneyland?

421
01:09:45,842 --> 01:09:47,762
You have a daughter, don't you?

422
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:52,324
Yeah. Emily.

423
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:56,602
I guess I'm here
because of her.

424
01:09:56,722 --> 01:10:00,002
What do you mean?

425
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,363
Well...

426
01:10:01,442 --> 01:10:06,122
I watch her grow up every day

427
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,883
and...

428
01:10:09,804 --> 01:10:14,163
I know that eventually
she'll walk away,

429
01:10:14,204 --> 01:10:17,363
live a life of her own.

430
01:10:17,443 --> 01:10:19,884
I'm frightened.

431
01:10:19,923 --> 01:10:21,883
Of what?

432
01:10:25,604 --> 01:10:27,005
Being alone.

433
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:29,885
Dying.

434
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:36,363
I thought it would
make me feel better,

435
01:10:36,444 --> 01:10:38,484
but it doesn't.

436
01:10:38,563 --> 01:10:41,044
Having a child, I mean.

437
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:49,645
How about you?

438
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:51,246
There must be someone out there.

439
01:10:53,245 --> 01:10:55,006
Natalya.

440
01:11:00,246 --> 01:11:02,766
I did a matching design
for her many years ago.

441
01:11:11,007 --> 01:11:14,727
And now, I'm afraid
to touch another woman.

442
01:11:21,766 --> 01:11:23,128
She said that she...

443
01:11:25,168 --> 01:11:28,608
She said, "You have
come back from hell."

444
01:11:29,648 --> 01:11:32,768
"I'll save you."
But she couldn't.

445
01:11:35,648 --> 01:11:37,127
She left me.

446
01:11:57,288 --> 01:11:58,649
I guess this is it.

447
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:14,410
It's not over.

448
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,180
It stopped.

449
01:15:45,064 --> 01:15:46,584
What are you doing?

450
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:13,505
Mother of God.

451
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:16,988
It's her.

452
01:17:17,068 --> 01:17:19,469
It's our mother.

453
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,868
It's all going to happen again.

454
01:17:24,989 --> 01:17:27,669
- Just like before.
- Marie?

455
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:32,549
- What?
- You're back in '66.

456
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:35,829
The truck.

457
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:37,270
The truck in the pig sty.

458
01:17:39,511 --> 01:17:40,871
It might work.

459
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:00,951
Hey.

460
01:18:13,072 --> 01:18:14,913
Come on!

461
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:20,913
That's him.
That's our father.

462
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:22,513
Nicolai, we've got
to do something.

463
01:18:22,594 --> 01:18:23,633
There's nothing we can do.

464
01:18:23,713 --> 01:18:25,393
What do you mean?
We're just going to stand by...

465
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,033
Nicolai, we can't stand by
and let him go upstairs

466
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:31,273
- and fucking kill her.
- It's too late.

467
01:18:33,795 --> 01:18:36,754
Hey, come on.
We can get the truck now.

468
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:38,393
- No!
- Come on!

469
01:18:50,474 --> 01:18:51,595
Oh, shit.

470
01:18:55,835 --> 01:18:58,035
Leave us alone,
you son of a bitch!

471
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:00,236
It's all been done.
You can't stop it.

472
01:19:00,316 --> 01:19:01,875
Yeah, but maybe
we can change it!

473
01:19:01,956 --> 01:19:03,836
It was all over
42 years ago!

474
01:19:03,915 --> 01:19:06,076
- Stop hurting her!
- It's not real!

475
01:19:06,115 --> 01:19:08,916
- Yeah, the fuck that isn't real!
- Stop. We've got to get the truck.

476
01:19:12,397 --> 01:19:14,277
We've got to get the truck.

477
01:19:14,357 --> 01:19:16,556
You must go if you want to live.
Go!

478
01:19:21,956 --> 01:19:22,956
Go!

479
01:19:28,317 --> 01:19:29,638
Go! Run!

480
01:19:29,717 --> 01:19:30,957
Run!

481
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,318
Natalya.

482
01:21:55,325 --> 01:21:57,005
Motherfucker!

483
01:25:03,296 --> 01:25:05,178
Papa.

484
01:25:12,018 --> 01:25:15,457
I'm so sorry this happened.

485
01:25:18,337 --> 01:25:21,417
I gave your mother

486
01:25:21,537 --> 01:25:24,659
everything I could...

487
01:25:28,658 --> 01:25:29,618
a life...

488
01:25:31,419 --> 01:25:32,859
a home.

489
01:25:37,578 --> 01:25:41,499
When she tried to take
my children away from me,

490
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,540
to take you away...

491
01:25:45,301 --> 01:25:47,780
to break the circle...

492
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:51,060
It wasn't easy
bringing us back together,

493
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:55,619
but it was worth it, you know,
just to see you again.

494
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:58,260
You belong with me
and the family...

495
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,819
at home.

496
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:11,061
No!

497
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:56,144
Why, God?

498
01:27:02,305 --> 01:27:03,665
Mr. Misharin?

499
01:27:09,025 --> 01:27:10,266
Please.

500
01:28:02,548 --> 01:28:05,387
I thought your birthday
would be a suitable time.

501
01:28:06,868 --> 01:28:07,827
You know...

502
01:28:07,909 --> 01:28:12,269
I was your age
when she killed me.

503
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:23,790
Come on!

504
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:32,031
We're still missing
one member of the family.

505
01:28:34,471 --> 01:28:37,029
Emily, your daughter.

506
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,832
Nicolai.

507
01:28:49,911 --> 01:28:52,911
Don't be afraid.
Your brother is with us now.

508
01:29:12,033 --> 01:29:14,913
I love all of you.

509
01:29:14,992 --> 01:29:17,232
I always will.

510
01:30:02,594 --> 01:30:03,595
Yes! Come on!

511
01:30:07,396 --> 01:30:09,076
Yes!

512
01:30:22,237 --> 01:30:25,117
Please let me go!

513
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:42,517
Where are you going, Milla?

514
01:30:43,918 --> 01:30:46,479
I need you.
I need all of you.

515
01:30:46,518 --> 01:30:49,198
Don't you think your mother
tried to leave before?

516
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:51,679
There's no way out of this.

517
01:30:51,718 --> 01:30:53,439
Come back.

518
01:30:54,718 --> 01:30:56,199
Shut up!

519
01:30:56,278 --> 01:30:58,838
Shut the fuck up!

520
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:06,080
No matter where you go...

521
01:31:13,639 --> 01:31:16,199
...will be with me together forever...

522
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,040
- Shut the fuck up!
- I've been waiting for you for so long.

523
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,560
Shut up!

524
01:31:37,322 --> 01:31:41,562
Whatever happens to them happens to us.

525
01:31:43,002 --> 01:31:45,202
Welcome to the family.

526
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:47,129
My mother never told me
about her parents.

527
01:33:49,209 --> 01:33:51,371
When she left for Russia,
I knew in my heart

528
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:52,891
I would never see her again.

529
01:33:56,049 --> 01:33:57,689
It's been a long time since she left,

530
01:33:57,729 --> 01:34:00,650
but I will never go after her,

531
01:34:00,729 --> 01:34:05,089
never try to find out what became
of her or her parents.

532
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:07,291
It's better that way.

533
01:34:07,371 --> 01:34:12,730
Better not to know,
better still to forget,

534
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:15,691
best of all,
to be abandoned.
