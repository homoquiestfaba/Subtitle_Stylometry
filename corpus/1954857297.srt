1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,408
Okay.

2
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,614
You can come in.

3
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:19,218
I'm sorry, I was just sound
checking the microphone here.

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,754
You guys must be all set.
Has he eaten?

5
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,022
Yes. Okay.

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,357
If he needs to go
to the bathroom,

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,094
do I just wave
my hands at someone?

8
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,000
Let me just finish
setting this up

9
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:37,103
and then I'll explain
what's going on.

10
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,972
Mark, he was only 19 years old

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,309
and he didn't understand
a lot of things.

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,249
DeFriest cap letter Mike dash.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,520
D-E-F-R-I-E-S-T.

14
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,988
Cap interview--

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,758
His dad died
and evidently the dad

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,999
had told him that he could
have certain tools.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,664
Had told him that he could
have certain tools.

18
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,135
No. Apparently Mark
didn't understand

19
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:13,673
about probate,
and he took the tools

20
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,742
and then his stepmother
called the police

21
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,445
and had him arrested for that.

22
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:28,254
He was in there for
four years for taking,

23
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,999
well, not even taking
his father's tools.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,091
Well, not even taking
his father's tools.

25
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,492
Okay.

26
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,695
I don't know if you remember me.

27
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,663
We met back in 1981.

28
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,432
I was a lot younger then.

29
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,133
I remember you.

30
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,502
Are you okay talking with me?

31
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,404
Sure.

32
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,439
Okay.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,608
And you really think all
this going to help, huh?

34
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:53,079
I suspect that I may be able to
make your life a lot better.

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,314
You know, if I was just a rapist

36
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,050
or a murderer or something,
they'd let me out.

37
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,999
I'm the idiot that made
them look like idiots.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm the idiot that made
them look like idiots.

39
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,642
He became Houdini.
So he could escape.

40
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,443
He could take a piece of paper

41
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,579
and make a key out of it.

42
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,615
He'd get out of anything.

43
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,000
Mark DeFriest.
Yeah, that's who it was.

44
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,185
Mark DeFriest.
Yeah, that's who it was.

45
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,759
He's smarter than
all the rest of them

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,327
that's in there.
That creates a problem

47
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,488
because they're scared of him.

48
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,505
He was in the worst wing.

49
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,607
Lived in total darkness
in a small cell.

50
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:58,078
No electricity.
His water had been cut off.

51
00:02:59,346 --> 00:02:59,999
There were stabbings,
murder, and mayhem.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,082
There were stabbings,
murder, and mayhem.

53
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,193
Someone who came
into the prison system

54
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,264
having never committed a
violent crime of any type.

55
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,103
I don't think
they'll ever let him out.

56
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,207
Mark DeFriest's entire
history should be examined.

57
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,999
Can you imagine what that
brain could have done?

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,245
Can you imagine what that
brain could have done?

59
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,000
Now, you see, that thing,

60
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,575
Now, you see, that thing,

61
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,977
that's a real
fighting machine there.

62
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,047
That's that fast shooting one.

63
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,518
Spitting out thousands
of rounds a minute.

64
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,687
If you had Mark here,
we could get that going

65
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,457
in a couple weeks easily.

66
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,597
This wrench right here
belonged to Mark DeFriest.

67
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,234
And we worked on a Lark with it

68
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,999
down at Apalachicola.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,237
Down at Apalachicola.

70
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,738
He was doing something
all the time.

71
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,708
And he was a whiz
at mechanicing everything.

72
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,143
That's Mark.

73
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,279
There he is right there
up here on the Lark.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,347
I believe that's Brenda.

75
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,282
I believe that's
his wife right there.

76
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,051
This was in '79.

77
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,991
I was working at a restaurant.

78
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:56,428
Mark and his father
were in Chattahoochee

79
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,532
doing some work on that bridge.

80
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,000
They were doing some
welding on the bridge.

81
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,701
They were doing some
welding on the bridge.

82
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,207
He was blonde,
blue eyes, young, funny.

83
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,444
I guess that was what attracted
me to him at the time.

84
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,650
At that point we were married.

85
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,999
His truck, the love of his life.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,529
His truck, the love of his life.

87
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,166
The back of it was like
a traveling garage.

88
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,434
It was immaculate.

89
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,003
His tools were as-- you
could eat off his tools,

90
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,372
they were so clean.

91
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,676
We traveled out west,
and the way he paid for it

92
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,145
was vehicles broken down
along the road

93
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,746
all the way along,
and he would stop

94
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,550
and he would help those people
and then they would pay.

95
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,454
I mean, he could
fix anything. Anything.

96
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,224
It feels like that was the best
time of your life in a way.

97
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,999
Yeah, it was fun.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,393
Yeah, it was fun.

99
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,695
Yeah, it was cool.

100
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,496
Could it have kept going?

101
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,564
I don't see why not.

102
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,400
My dad died and that's
what screwed it up.

103
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,402
I went down to Florida.

104
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,363
I should have stayed the
fuck away from that place.

105
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,010
I can't remember how he
found out about his father

106
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,379
being in the hospital because
we did make it to the hospital

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,514
before his father died.
But when we were going

108
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:26,151
to go see his father again,
we found out he was dead.

109
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,321
No one had told him
his dad was dead.

110
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:29,999
His dad died, and it appeared
that he was here, around here.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,325
His dad died, and it appeared
that he was here, around here.

112
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:37,596
And evidently
the dad had told him

113
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,633
that he could have
certain tools and stuff.

114
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,701
I knew he wanted me
to have all his tools

115
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,638
and stuff from a shop he had
from a joint business

116
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,173
we used to do,
and I picked the stuff up

117
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,243
before the will was probated,
because it was my understanding

118
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,544
that the tools and stuff
would go to me

119
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,415
and all the insurance policies
and money went to my stepmother.

120
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,999
He was only 19 years old
and he didn't understand.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,586
He was only 19 years old
and he didn't understand

122
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,688
about probate.

123
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:08,294
And they took the tools
and then his stepmother

124
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,563
called the police and had
him arrested for that.

125
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,404
They come to pick him up
and the sheriff

126
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,206
told me his self, and I
think he told Cooper, too--

127
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,574
I was, you know he said--

128
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,643
See, the sheriff
come to pick him up

129
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,211
and he just wanted
to talk to them

130
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,280
about the situation, see?

131
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,999
But Mark broke
and run from the trailer.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,150
But Mark broke
and run from the trailer

133
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,552
and it all started from there.

134
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,754
Just where they captured him at,

135
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,291
I don't remember and everything.

136
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,115
He had four years
and that whole situation

137
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,050
sucked because he was
in there for four years

138
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:09,322
for taking, well, not even
taking his father's tools.

139
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,659
The Florida Division
of Corrections

140
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,294
protects the public.

141
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,463
Society rightfully expects that.

142
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,366
At the same time, it's committed
to help the people

143
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:24,703
within these walls return
to society as valuable citizens.

144
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,407
That commitment requires
a staff with special skills.

145
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,999
Thoroughly trained,
dedicated people.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,509
Thoroughly trained,
dedicated people

147
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,514
who look forward to expanding
the correctional horizons.

148
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:44,490
I went to visit him
every weekend.

149
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,627
It was only about five
miles across the bridge.

150
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm not using to being
around those kind of people,

151
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,669
and I hate to be stereotypical,
but you know what kind of people

152
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,405
are usually in prison,
and you know what kind

153
00:08:59,406 --> 00:08:59,999
of people usually visit them,
and I felt way out

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,441
of people usually visit them,
and I felt way out

155
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,743
of my league there.
Not that I'm better

156
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,679
than anybody,
but I am better than that.

157
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,448
All of a sudden I'm around a
bunch of these fucking idiots

158
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,417
that think
they're fucking Einstein

159
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,420
of criminal behavior
and whatever.

160
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,556
Think they're real
dangerous people.

161
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,326
And you got guards
trying to seduce you,

162
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,661
you know, saying
if you'll have sex with me

163
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,131
I'll pull a favor for Mark,
or stuff like that.

164
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,568
It's a nasty world.

165
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,000
Four years, wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

166
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,470
Four years, wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

167
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,173
Have a nice day.

168
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,177
How am I supposed to feel?

169
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,379
How would you feel?

170
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,471
Go, go, go!

171
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,406
Another guy, half of them
got hung up on a fence

172
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,175
on the razor wire shit,
he was screaming,

173
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,512
"DeFriest, wait up for me!"

174
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,550
I'm, like, what the fuck
is wrong with you people, man?

175
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,554
There's an art to everything.

176
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,457
My dad taught me how to deal
with stuff like that.

177
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,459
So he taught you
how to cheat razor wire?

178
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,361
Well, not that
particular brand of it,

179
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:29,999
but, I mean,
infiltration is part

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,330
but, I mean,
infiltration is part

181
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,265
of fucking
military training, man.

182
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,034
Sabotage
and counterintelligence.

183
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,669
That's all stuff you learned?

184
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,371
Yeah.

185
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,641
It's part of war.

186
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,684
I was trained from age six

187
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,187
guerilla warfare,
guns, explosives,

188
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,757
bombs, anti-tank rockets.

189
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,333
My father, he was in the
OSS during World War II.

190
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,469
He was into that whole
fifties and sixties thing

191
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,704
about the fucking Reds
were coming and shit.

192
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,341
Now, that was really a whole
culture thing back then.

193
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,510
That fucking dude was nuts.

194
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,711
He really was.

195
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,248
I never saw a Russian yet.

196
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,154
We went to one of
my old friend's house.

197
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:29,999
They had a Ford pickup truck.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
They had a Ford pickup truck.

199
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,068
Hotwired the truck, we back
out, voom, and took off.

200
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,981
We was in Tallahassee
and then we got caught

201
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,284
in that fucking motel and
all that other bullshit.

202
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,391
It turned into the crime
of the century.

203
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,564
You know me, just one
problem after the next.

204
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,999
He even said to me,
when he was in ACI.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,450
He even said to me,
when he was in ACI

206
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:31,683
before he escaped,
you know, you should

207
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,253
move on because
when I get out of here,

208
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,520
I'm going to be
so screwed up in the head

209
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,689
it's not even going to be
worth your time,

210
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,626
and he was right.

211
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,028
Because, you know,
he said he was being,

212
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,563
I guess, raped in the prison,

213
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:48,133
and he was having to fight
because, you know,

214
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,671
blonde and blue eyes
in prison, not good.

215
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,240
Yeah, so they sent me
to the nuthouse

216
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,143
for a psychological evaluation.

217
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,286
They thought you were crazy?

218
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,021
Yeah. Why?

219
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:13,492
I have no idea. Do I seem crazy?

220
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,060
Can we have an honest opinion

221
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,262
from the peanut gallery?

222
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,665
Do I seem crazy?

223
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,228
The Florida State Hospital
Forensic Services,

224
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:55,000
a secure facility with mental
health treatment inside.

225
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,968
People are committed
by the criminal courts

226
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,504
from all over the state
of Florida to the hospital.

227
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,000
This is our carpentry
vocational training program.

228
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,673
This is our carpentry
vocational training program

229
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,075
here at Florida State Hospital.

230
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,711
This is one of our six
vocational training areas.

231
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,613
We have educational programs
from preschool

232
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,749
through junior college.

233
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,252
Students seem to like it
because of the immediate

234
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,355
response that they get.

235
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,271
Yeah.

236
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,377
I was quite young
when I started there.

237
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,711
I think I was about 29.

238
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,614
I found that the people
I worked with

239
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,284
on the wards were local people

240
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,354
who that was the economy there.

241
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,190
And I always said if there were

242
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,093
a meat-processing factory,
they'd all be processing meat.

243
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,597
I worked there at the time.

244
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,970
That sucked.

245
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,671
Because I was
a social worker there

246
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:11,376
and I had patients that
were looking up to me

247
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,979
as their social worker
and then I was trying to help

248
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,083
and give them advice
and I've got this husband

249
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,219
over there in Forensic Services.

250
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,571
He made these recently.

251
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,573
He made these chairs.

252
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,541
He cut the strips
from the inside lining

253
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,510
of potato chip bags.

254
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,999
That's what
this metallic foil is.

255
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,712
That's what
this metallic foil is.

256
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,050
It's the lining
of potato chip bags.

257
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:09,154
The clown in a straight jacket.

258
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:13,124
Sort of himself
he feels, I think.

259
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,061
Well, I'm Mark's wife,
the most important

260
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,596
person in his life,

261
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,132
and he feels
the love of his life

262
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,402
as he is mine,
and we've been married

263
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,273
for almost 14 years this month.

264
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,999
This is a special album
that I made.

265
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,613
This is a special album
that I made

266
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,015
just for Mark and me.

267
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:40,151
I hope he gets a chance
to see it someday.

268
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:44,023
It's called "Our Love Book."

269
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,226
This was
on our very first visit.

270
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,096
He looks so happy there.

271
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,064
We were--we had
just been married

272
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,167
a week by proxy when
I went down to visit him

273
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,437
and met him in person
for the first time.

274
00:18:59,438 --> 00:18:59,999
He's just got so many aspects
to his personality.

275
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,440
He's just got so many aspects
to his personality.

276
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,675
Great sense of humor.

277
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:07,512
He's creative, very artistic.

278
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,648
Not autistic, but artistic.

279
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,449
Very good with his hands.

280
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,251
He draws well.

281
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,388
These are cards that he made
from start to finish.

282
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:21,059
They're braced behind
with strips of cardboard.

283
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,728
Gives it lots of dimension.

284
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:28,366
Mark and Bonnie DeFriest, KT95,
The Dark Side of the Moon.

285
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,999
If he had just accepted
his first brief sentence.

286
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,271
If he had just accepted
his first brief sentence

287
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,275
of four years, he probably
would have gotten out,

288
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,612
but his personality
didn't allow him to do that.

289
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,347
I think the only way
we're going to be able

290
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,350
to get him out is to prove
that he has some mental problems

291
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,988
and that he never should
have been incarcerated.

292
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,025
Hi, this is John Middleton.

293
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,094
Hi, Mr. Middleton.
This is Bonnie.

294
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,629
I haven't talked
to you for ages.

295
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,097
That's true. How are you doing?

296
00:19:59,098 --> 00:19:59,999
Fine. How are you?

297
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,299
Fine. How are you?

298
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,267
Oh, just fine.
What's going on with Mark?

299
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,170
Well, I think,
you know, right now

300
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,139
Mark needs some hope
that he can hang onto.

301
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,176
What I hope to do, if possible,

302
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:15,246
because of, you know,
of mental problems,

303
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,084
I hope to get him released
for time served.

304
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,153
Well, the only two avenues
of relief for him is either

305
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,222
clemency or the Florida
Parole Commission.

306
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,092
The way that you would go about

307
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,394
pursuing either
of those two avenues

308
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:29,999
would be to get him psychiatrically
evaluated. Mm-hmm.

309
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,031
Would be to get him psychiatrically
evaluated. Mm-hmm.

310
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,532
I agree with that. Yeah.

311
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,600
That's the start. Good.

312
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,103
I just felt it's time
for a change.

313
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,972
This has gone on long enough
and if possible,

314
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,507
I want to talk to Mr. Middleton

315
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,143
and see if we can get him out.

316
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,462
I met Mark about 30 years ago.

317
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,266
Of anybody that
I know of in prison,

318
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,202
Mark is probably short
of a death row inmate,

319
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,372
one of the hardest people
to get out because Mark

320
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,677
has put himself in about as deep
a hole as you can get.

321
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,382
His parole date is well beyond
the expiration of his sentence,

322
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,985
which is an indication usually
that the Parole Commission

323
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,354
doesn't want
to let you out of prison.

324
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:29,999
The Commission has got a man
who is a notorious prisoner.

325
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,291
The Commission has got a man
who is a notorious prisoner

326
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,592
in the State of Florida
and probably

327
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,229
a notorious prisoner
across the country.

328
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,332
And the only way
he's ever going to get out is,

329
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,501
in my opinion, because
of his mental health status

330
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:47,138
and that finally society,
including the Parole Commission,

331
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:52,577
starts to address the issues
of the mentally ill in prison.

332
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:57,315
I have to review all that
in order to put it together

333
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,999
for the Commission
so they understand the...

334
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,486
for the Commission
so they understand the...

335
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:06,392
they understand how Mark
ended up where he is.

336
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,031
I was a wild child, you know.

337
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:16,267
They tried to get me interact
with other people and children,

338
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,471
and I was more interested
in how things worked.

339
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:29,999
I'd spend days down in there.

340
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,216
I'd spend days down in there.

341
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:32,250
They thought I was crazy
with my electronics

342
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,152
and chemicals and all this crap.

343
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,088
Couple times I blew myself up.

344
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:39,358
It got kind of weird.

345
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,230
I started working with my father
at an early age.

346
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,971
We had a real
close relationship.

347
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,373
There was a definitely
a father-son bond there.

348
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,675
Everett was like a...

349
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,999
to me, Everett was always
like an Indiana Jones.

350
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,179
To me, Everett was always
like an Indiana Jones.

351
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,714
I mean, I loved Everett.

352
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,616
You know, if it could be
done, Everett could do it.

353
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,052
And so I think
that's where Mark gets that.

354
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:13,258
Marilyn, his mother,
we'd hear her scream

355
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,327
about him and scream at him.

356
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,196
I'd see the stuff laid out

357
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,465
on the table, you know.

358
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,500
Like, what kind of stuff?
Like clocks.

359
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,369
He loved to take clocks apart.

360
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,005
Loved to.

361
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:33,077
I only met his mother twice.

362
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,380
I thought she was a cold bitch.

363
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,249
I thought that she didn't
really care for Mark.

364
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,985
I saw no love. I saw no hugs.

365
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,186
I saw no, I love you.

366
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,757
I saw nothing
of that nature with her.

367
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,226
His mother told me
that when his parents

368
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:52,563
were divorced and he was
sent to a school for boys

369
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:57,201
who were disruptive, I think
that's how she phrased it,

370
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,999
and he ran away from there.

371
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,406
And he ran away from there.

372
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:05,310
And because of having
been an escaper

373
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:09,747
early in his incarceration,
he has turned

374
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,351
the whole system
against himself.

375
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:23,361
Most people in jail,
even the mentally ill ones,

376
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:28,166
recognize that you don't
tick off the jailers.

377
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,999
He didn't get that.

378
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,169
He didn't get that.

379
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,703
I was going over there
on my breaks

380
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,305
and then someone
had something to say about that

381
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,441
because they don't like that.

382
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,443
But I had been over to see him,
and he just wanted me

383
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,180
to hurry up and leave
because, see, he had a plan.

384
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,355
Basically, our carpentry
training program here

385
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,590
consists of woodworking.

386
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:59,630
As you can see here, the class
has just finished a wood bench.

387
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,000
They sent me
to arts and craft school.

388
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,166
They sent me
to arts and craft school

389
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,969
and they got these
rolled up copper sheets.

390
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,407
I'm just looking at it and
looking at them thinking...

391
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,977
they really don't
want me to stay here.

392
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,474
It's all fucked up.

393
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,691
And then all the nuts in there,
they were all laughing at me

394
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,161
like it was a big fucking joke
or something.

395
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,305
Then everybody goes, ooh.

396
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:54,011
And just my luck, I'm looking
for somebody driving by

397
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,746
who would be happy enough
to donate their car

398
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,516
to a worthy cause
and there was nobody convenient.

399
00:26:58,517 --> 00:26:59,999
There was no traffic.

400
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,152
There was no traffic.

401
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:02,253
So I said, oh, well,
backup plan two,

402
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,255
so I head for the swamp because
I've already been in there.

403
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,591
I know that.

404
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,593
At some point was it,
like, oh, my God,

405
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,061
you're married to--

406
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,130
Satan.

407
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,033
Satan.

408
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,169
Mm-hmm.

409
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,238
He escaped there--
From there,

410
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,175
and come out here,

411
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,999
but he broke
two or three bolt cutters

412
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,645
but he broke
two or three bolt cutters

413
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,748
trying to get out
of the handcuffs we figured.

414
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,485
And that's when they told me
that he had made some kind

415
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,388
of little old cap pistol,
you know, out of some

416
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,356
match heads
or something like that

417
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:18,563
and of course, they put it up
as a big, big thing, you know.

418
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,366
To Mark it wasn't
anything at all.

419
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,638
I loved him.

420
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,999
I loved him with all my heart,

421
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,608
I loved him with all my heart,

422
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:34,979
and he broke it...

423
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,481
into many pieces.

424
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,283
You go to a hospital
where they think

425
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,419
they can help you
and you make a gun

426
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,655
and you try to run away
and just keep getting

427
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,591
into trouble, more trouble,
more trouble,

428
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,259
more years, more years.

429
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,996
How long you think I'm going
to sit here and wait for you?

430
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,003
That's when I said forget this.

431
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,146
I just, you know, screwed it up.

432
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,016
Got in a bad situation
where I needed a car real quick

433
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,486
and got fucking jammed up
and caught by the police.

434
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,328
He wasn't out there
shooting people

435
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,429
or anything of that nature.

436
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,532
I don't think his crimes
involved pulling a gun

437
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,999
and stealing a car,
if I recall correctly.

438
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,235
And stealing a car,
if I recall correctly.

439
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,636
If you did that in Miami,
they'd give you a medal

440
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,404
for not shooting somebody.

441
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:37,341
But I think what happened is
is that the hospital

442
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,782
probably didn't
want him back either.

443
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,654
And then came
the Bay County Jail bullshit.

444
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:50,756
And here we go again.

445
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:59,531
We had a war going on,
a war of irritation.

446
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,238
Mark DeFriest reacts and
that's what he has done

447
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,674
through his entire prison life.

448
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,375
And when you react
in the prison system,

449
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,312
you get squashed down.

450
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,220
Proper intelligence training
teaches you how to deal

451
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,389
with all that crap.

452
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,994
I just tore the place down,
literally.

453
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,130
Then they put me
in another cell,

454
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,267
but I smashed the light out
and got in--

455
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,668
You could actually climb
in a pipe galley

456
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,003
and get all kind of metals.

457
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,372
I got these big long crowbars,
so I just bam,

458
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,743
and just rolled the door down
like a can of sardines.

459
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,113
Yeah, you've read
all the newspaper articles

460
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,548
and all that crazy shit?

461
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,651
I had them going there
for awhile.

462
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,248
Dr. Berland was
appointed by the court

463
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,119
to determine whether
or not Mr. DeFriest

464
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,999
was competent at the time
the offenses were committed

465
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,522
was competent at the time
the offenses were committed

466
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,558
and competent to stand trial.

467
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,397
Competency requires you have
a factual appreciation

468
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,133
of the nature of
the proceedings against you.

469
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:46,637
That means, do you know
what all the different roles

470
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,572
and procedures
are in the court system.

471
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,673
You know what a judge does,

472
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,475
you know what a prosecutor does,

473
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,378
you know how
a plea bargain works.

474
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,564
If I recall correctly,
there was some...

475
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:18,002
animosity between Dr. Berland and Mr.
DeFriest.

476
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:22,072
And I say animosity that only Dr.
Berland liked Mark DeFriest.

477
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,576
Whether or not that affected
his evaluation, I don't know.

478
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,999
He was very clever.

479
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,015
He was very clever.

480
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:34,652
In all of his escapes,
he was very clever,

481
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,554
very controlled, very planful.

482
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,757
He made working guns
from materials

483
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:43,494
he could assemble
in his cell in jail.

484
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,763
He was not confused.

485
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,565
He could follow
a long conversation

486
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,099
and stay on topic.

487
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,435
No bizarre statements
or actions.

488
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,105
He knew what was
going on around him.

489
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,076
And...

490
00:32:59,077 --> 00:32:59,999
four of the five jailers,
they had seen no evidence

491
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,111
four of the five jailers,
they had seen no evidence

492
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,314
of behavior suggesting
the presence of delusions

493
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,749
and hallucinations, major thinking
disturbance, or despondency.

494
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,184
The fifth jailer,
only recently hired,

495
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:11,255
describes periods
of strange behavior

496
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,523
by the defendant
during which he would

497
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,625
appear to lose contact
with his surroundings,

498
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,061
eat bugs and stomp around
in his cell area

499
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:18,597
for no apparent reason.

500
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,501
You could imagine
what kind of story

501
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,136
the officers at the jail are
going to give concerning Mark.

502
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,204
They're going
to sit there, you know,

503
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,472
if it's a thumbs up
and a thumbs down,

504
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,999
they're going to go, does
it mean him going to trial?

505
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,975
They're going to go, does
it mean him going to trial?

506
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,476
Yeah, he's competent.

507
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,446
And there are actually
six psychologists

508
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,182
or psychiatrists who have
done evaluations on Mark,

509
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,685
four of which found him
to be incompetent

510
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,422
and only one of the six
had--determined him

511
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,725
to be competent to stand trial.

512
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,227
I offered an opinion in writing

513
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,596
and I said he was competent
and malingering.

514
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,499
Malingering is the outright
faking of symptoms

515
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,136
you don't have at all.

516
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,242
You know how you go through
phases in life?

517
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,478
I was in my gunsmith phase
where I could make a gun

518
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,147
out of anything.

519
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,119
You see this?

520
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,520
You see that's a toothpaste tube

521
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,055
if you look at it closely.

522
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,757
It's handled like a gun,

523
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,127
and it's not loaded,
don't worry.

524
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,664
They'd jack it up a level
and I'd jack it up some more.

525
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,433
Fuck them,
they can't take a joke.

526
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:54,124
Okay, did you make an escape
from that cell?

527
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,694
Yeah. I was in that cell
that they had specially

528
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,496
custom designed for me. Where'd you
get the stuff to make that last gun?

529
00:34:59,497 --> 00:34:59,999
What do you want,
the whole low down.

530
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,265
What do you want,
the whole low down

531
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,567
on how all this shit
happened, is that it? Yeah.

532
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,735
When we--
Through the hall, man,

533
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,104
one of these dudes
says his damn mother

534
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,340
and shit's out there
and he wants to go back.

535
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,308
And he wasn't much help to you then, huh?
No, I says, holy shit, man.

536
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,444
I really got me a couple of
real, real good ones here.

537
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,746
Did you shoot at Crews? I
wasn't shooting at Crews.

538
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:18,315
You didn't shoot at him? What's
the purpose of it? He's done.

539
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,051
He's hidden anyway. How could
I shoot the son of a bitch?

540
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,020
And the only reason
I shot the gun off

541
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,022
was because Charlie says,
just check and see

542
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,991
what the gun really does.
So I aimed at some

543
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,659
plastic fucking
thing on the wall

544
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,999
and I struck and it went poof.

545
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,095
And I struck and it went poof.

546
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,162
And then the goon squad come in

547
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,465
and they beat
the fuck out of me.

548
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,102
You're lucky you weren't still holding
a gun. Yeah, so they tell me.

549
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,037
Really, they'd have killed you.
That's what they said.

550
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:43,407
Okay. So it is your contention
that you were not trying

551
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:44,675
to kill Crews? Hell no, man.

552
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,078
You can ask any
of them dudes up there.

553
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,999
They charged him
with attempted murder.

554
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,520
They charged him
with attempted murder.

555
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,064
He was placed
in solitary confinement,

556
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,333
lived in total darkness
in a small cell,

557
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,202
was not allowed to communicate.

558
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,337
There were post orders,

559
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,973
and in the post orders
it states,

560
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,742
"No clothes for prisoner.
No mattress or sheets.

561
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,078
No matches, cigarettes,
et cetera.

562
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,247
Conversation limited
to business only."

563
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,416
Mr. DeFriest was deprived
of all toiletries,

564
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:29,999
was deprived of toilet paper,
soap, tissue, toothpaste.

565
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,621
Was deprived of toilet paper,
soap, tissue, toothpaste.

566
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,423
The water was turned off
at his cell.

567
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,058
He could not flush his toilet.

568
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,759
He could not bathe or shower.

569
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,229
He had to eat without utensils
and in the darkness.

570
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,999
Yeah, they tried to torture me.

571
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,200
Yeah, they tried to torture me.

572
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,222
They were spraying
all them fire hoses and water

573
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,024
and all that bullshit
in there on me,

574
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,560
fucking trying to kill me.

575
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:24,374
So you have basically
a 10-day period,

576
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,111
11-day period of time where
Mark had all this trouble.

577
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,999
You have him being
evaluated by Dr. Berland,

578
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,081
You have him being
evaluated by Dr. Berland,

579
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,282
and you've got
an escape attempt,

580
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,451
and I'm not so certain
that a single human being

581
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,187
can take all of that at once.

582
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,201
They walked me
across the courthouse,

583
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,970
said, plead guilty to life
and we'll drop

584
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,338
all these other cases
we're charging you

585
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,407
you picked up in jail.

586
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,643
Man, I didn't give a shit.

587
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,000
I just wanted
to get out of that jail,

588
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,279
I just wanted
to get out of that jail,

589
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,681
whatever it took.

590
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,226
At sentencing,
this judge, quote,

591
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:20,063
"Now, have you been mistreated
in any manner by any person?

592
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,999
Defendant, "I guess you could--" I
guess you could call the way I'm being

593
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,301
treated now mistreated.

594
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,970
The defense counsel said
you had some comments,

595
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,071
you wanted to make
at this point.

596
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,999
Put it on the record.
Let's hear it.

597
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,541
Put it on the record.
Let's hear it.

598
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,042
"Well, I'm being held over there

599
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,977
in a hell's hole
right now, naked.

600
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,246
Look, I just want them to do
something about it, you know.

601
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,115
Give me a mattress
or some clothes."

602
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,284
I don't run the jail,
but I can suggest

603
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,985
to the jailers that
if you can't give him

604
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,620
a mattress and some clothes,
why don't you drive him

605
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,322
on down to Lake Butler today?

606
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,224
Ain't no way you can make
them give me a mattress?

607
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,325
Let me visit my wife?

608
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,227
We can sometimes
talk to the sheriff,

609
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,396
but I think he wants
you out of there,

610
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:55,165
Mr. DeFriest, just as bad
as you want to leave.

611
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,067
Let's hope so.

612
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,269
Buddy, call and see if I sentence Mr.
DeFriest today,

613
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,999
fingerprint him today
and he waives PSI--

614
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,438
Fingerprint him today
and he waives PSI--

615
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,674
See if they'll drive him
down to Lake Butler today.

616
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,076
That was it.

617
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,121
You have a psychological
report dated August 3rd.

618
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,457
By August 14th he's pled
and he's out of here.

619
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,026
Pled to a life sentence.

620
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,397
Now, I'm not certain
that that's due process.

621
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,999
Quick process, I don't know
if it's due process.

622
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,168
Quick process, I don't know
if it's due process.

623
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:32,169
But the bottom line is,
the amount of time

624
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,403
this man received is ridiculous

625
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,506
compared to most people
in the state prison system.

626
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:40,144
And I've been going in prisons
30 years, so I've seen a lot.

627
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,501
Oh, you got the Christmas card?

628
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,669
Well, I ain't got the card.

629
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,305
The letter's in here.

630
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,375
Not the card.

631
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,243
What's he say?

632
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:17,247
He says about
faithful friends here.

633
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,350
"Hello, my beloved friends.

634
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,553
Sorry I haven't
wrote much this year.

635
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,991
I keep hoping
and praying for good news

636
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,999
so I can write
a letter of good cheer,

637
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,028
so I can write
a letter of good cheer,

638
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:34,298
but nothing much ever happens
of a non-depressive nature.

639
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:37,367
Life just seems
to roll on, on, and on,

640
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:41,004
stuck in a quagmire
of stone and steel.

641
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,041
27 and 3/4 years now,

642
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,410
and no end in sight.

643
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,145
Though I have tried my best

644
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,380
to mind my own business
and keep to myself,

645
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,750
out of trouble,
hoping to make Level 3.

646
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:58,188
The plan had some
poignant moments

647
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,999
as I was abducted by aliens

648
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,558
as I was abducted by aliens

649
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,127
and locked up
in a solitary confinement

650
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,430
for two months over the summer.

651
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,499
So, my friends,
that's the situation update.

652
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,370
Please pray for me
as I often do for you folks.

653
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:15,739
I want you to send this letter

654
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,575
with a Christmas card
and note from Bonnie

655
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:22,079
to wish you all
a happy holiday season.

656
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,413
Please write soon.

657
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:27,718
In light, love,
and blessing, Mark.

658
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,999
20 years, look at that,
a lifetime's work.

659
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,488
20 years, look at that,
a lifetime's work.

660
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,689
He could be outside
producing things,

661
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,325
you know, doing things.

662
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,196
"I'm here, you're there.

663
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:42,332
Any idea what that means?

664
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,303
One of us is
in the wrong place."

665
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,372
He was offered a plea bargain,

666
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:52,109
and being young
and not legally wise,

667
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,478
he accepted it.

668
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,417
He got screwed over.

669
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,697
I remember Mark DeFriest.

670
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,566
I was the warden
at Florida State Prison,

671
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,535
the worst of the worst.

672
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,271
It's the prison
that houses death row

673
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,540
and the death chamber.

674
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:29,999
And it was regarded as the
hell hole of this earth.

675
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,348
And it was regarded as the
hell hole of this earth.

676
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:34,484
It was a place that if
you just mentioned FSP

677
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,721
to any offender anywhere
in the state of Florida,

678
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,625
you'd get his instant cooperation
because nobody wanted

679
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,627
to be sent
to Florida State Prison.

680
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:46,163
And that was often
done as punishment

681
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,331
to prisoners around the state.

682
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:49,966
If you couldn't control them,

683
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,602
if disciplinary measures
didn't help,

684
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,670
then you would bag them up,

685
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,038
put them on a bus and send them

686
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,307
to Florida State Prison
and they'd come back

687
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,110
with their tail
between their legs.

688
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,512
There's no TVs.
There's no radios.

689
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,147
There's no nothing.
There's nothing but death

690
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,382
and drama and all the bullshit

691
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:06,616
that went along with it.

692
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,618
It was a really
depressing place.

693
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,288
Solitary confinement
in a prison cell,

694
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,223
books and magazines
are contraband.

695
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,291
Do anything wrong
and they put you

696
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,259
on the consolidated
security list,

697
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,597
you don't get your one hour
of yard per week.

698
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,606
Not a day, a week.

699
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,010
So you can go two, three, four,

700
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,681
five, six, seven years,
and never see the yard.

701
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:52,362
There's just no way that
this endless punishment

702
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:55,165
is ever going
to make him behave.

703
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,167
He's just not
that kind of a person.

704
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,436
He doesn't react to that.
He's intelligent.

705
00:43:59,437 --> 00:43:59,999
He recognizes abuse on the part.

706
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,538
He recognizes abuse on the part

707
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:04,341
of the criminal justice system.

708
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,710
He fights back against it.

709
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,457
Cuff up, DeFriest.

710
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,759
I know a lot
of secret prison crafts.

711
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,629
Weapons, locks and keys,
stashes,

712
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,397
all sorts of bizarre shit.

713
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,366
My prison file is
two-and-a-half feet thick

714
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:29,999
and it reads like a 007
James Bond spy novel.

715
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,068
And it reads like a 007
James Bond spy novel.

716
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:35,238
State of Florida Department
Corrections Disciplinary Report.

717
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,606
Possession
of escape paraphernalia.

718
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,441
Found a homemade handcuff key
in inmate DeFriest's

719
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,977
front pocket.
Gain time loss, 45 days.

720
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,980
X-rays showed clearly that
the key was in DeFriest's mouth.

721
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,082
Possession of a weapon,
piece of hacksaw blade concealed

722
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,152
between the lining and sole
of inmate DeFriest's right shoe.

723
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,620
Fuck it. Write a DR.

724
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,622
Department of Corrections
Disciplinary Report.

725
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,357
Failure to comply
with count procedure.

726
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,725
Inmate DeFriest answered
master count by saying--

727
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,662
James Bond 007.
Gain time loss, 90 days.

728
00:44:58,663 --> 00:44:59,999
Inmate DeFriest broke the
ratchet end of the handcuffs.

729
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,164
Inmate DeFriest broke the
ratchet end of the handcuffs.

730
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,399
Destruction of state property.

731
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,435
Subject to reimburse the State
in the amount of $18.90

732
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,470
for the handcuffs. DeFriest
said-- Fuck that shit.

733
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,105
Possession of a weapon,
a homemade knife.

734
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,740
Possession of contraband.
Double twisted piece of wire.

735
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,109
Piece of ink pen tubing.
Gain time loss, 45 days.

736
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,978
One homemade ice pick,
12 inches in length.

737
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:17,747
Five .22 caliber bullets inside
a black sandal under the bed.

738
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,382
When asked for any statement
he would like to make,

739
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,454
inmate DeFriest stated--
I'm James Bond 007.

740
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:42,539
Aluminum handcuff keys,
seven hacksaw blades,

741
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,008
razor blades.

742
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,544
Where there's a will
there's a way,

743
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:53,016
and I'm not sure exactly
what all those keys fit.

744
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,152
We caution our officers when
they're wearing their keys,

745
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,654
you know how
you wear them on your belt?

746
00:45:57,655 --> 00:45:59,522
We make sure--
They should be putting them

747
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,000
in their pocket
because if you wear them

748
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,057
in their pocket
because if you wear them

749
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,159
around and they're hanging
out where they can see them,

750
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,363
that's how this inmate,
we got one particular inmate

751
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:10,533
who's really good
at looking at the key cuts

752
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,136
and memorizing it
and then figuring out

753
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,672
some way to make something, a
key that would actually work.

754
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,541
Mark DeFriest.
That's who it was.

755
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,011
It just so happens
that the trays

756
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,345
that they were using at the time

757
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,215
were 3/16th of an inch thick,
and so you can slice them up

758
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,583
and make the teeth out of that.

759
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:29,999
So I made keys that fit
every prison lock in America.

760
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,080
So I made keys that fit
every prison lock in America.

761
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:34,658
We didn't give him
much opportunity

762
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,460
to do that in a long time.

763
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,536
Looking over this
brings back memories here.

764
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,339
Dr. Berland's report
is right here,

765
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,574
if I recall correctly.

766
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,044
Is that Berland?
That's Dr. Berland's report.

767
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:57,580
That document right there is
what was sent to the judge.

768
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,416
The commission is either
going to be open

769
00:46:59,417 --> 00:46:59,999
to what we're trying to do,
or they're just going

770
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,718
to what we're trying to do,
or they're just going

771
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:03,253
to slam the door in our face.

772
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,722
And I think you have
to have something

773
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:11,161
eye catching to take
their eye off that file.

774
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,997
Something for them
to look at Mark as a person

775
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,966
and as a human being
with a mental health issue

776
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,469
as opposed to this inmate
who is incorrigible

777
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,705
and who gets more
disciplinary reports

778
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:25,109
than any other inmate, probably,
in the prison system ever.

779
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:36,186
The plan is to try to get
some legal help for him

780
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,622
based upon the fact that he was
originally sent to prison

781
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,991
against the advice
of certain psychiatrists

782
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,594
who felt he shouldn't
stand trial,

783
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,763
or he wasn't capable
of standing trial.

784
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:49,966
And based upon
all of the evidence,

785
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:54,338
of what this 28 years
of prison has done to him.

786
00:47:58,609 --> 00:47:59,999
Mark was in the place
that they've changed

787
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,610
Mark was in the place
that they've changed

788
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,979
the name several times
to throw the media off,

789
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,584
but it's been called Q wing
and X wing and whatever.

790
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,620
I found that I had
a goon squad that was

791
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,290
beating inmates unmercifully.

792
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,560
I'd find inmates
laying in their cells,

793
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,730
eyes swollen shut.

794
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:26,069
It's always been my philosophy,

795
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,104
and that of the people I trust,

796
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,999
that convicted men and women
are sent to prison

797
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,474
that convicted men and women
are sent to prison

798
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:35,378
as punishment
and not for punishment.

799
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,980
There's a big difference.

800
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,616
But at Florida State Prison,
you'd continue to be

801
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:43,087
punished day
after day after day.

802
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,024
A lot of things were going on

803
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:51,162
at Florida State Prison that
most folks wouldn't believe.

804
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:59,536
I was wondering, can I talk
to you about a problem I got?

805
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:00,000
After years of silence, I really
need to share it with someone.

806
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:03,606
After years of silence, I really
need to share it with someone.

807
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,609
When I first came in here,
I was brutally gang raped

808
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,280
by 14 or 15 prisoners on J wing.

809
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,348
They hurt me so bad
I needed surgery

810
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,751
to put my body
back together again.

811
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,658
At what point
did you stop believing

812
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,560
you would ever
get out of prison?

813
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:24,761
Right then and there.

814
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:27,597
There was no coming out
of that shit.

815
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:29,999
Come on, man.

816
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,367
Come on, man.

817
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:32,635
Death was just a matter--
I'm already dead.

818
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,704
I was already dead.

819
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:38,308
I was a walking dead person.
Who gives a shit?

820
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:42,045
Nothing counted.

821
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:45,181
Nothing counted.
Nothing mattered.

822
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,517
So I just did the best I could

823
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:49,320
to stay alive and wage war.

824
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:59,195
For the last 16 years
I've been a chain gang punk,

825
00:49:59,196 --> 00:49:59,999
and I confess I see more
of a girl now than a man.

826
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,634
And I confess I see more
of a girl now than a man.

827
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,569
I was a normal
19-year-old boy man

828
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:10,139
with a wife I thought I loved.

829
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,477
I wasn't gay or a transvestite,
but what's a poor girl to do

830
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:18,616
dropped in the zoo in this role
for as long as I'm in here.

831
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:24,153
I got this crazy Cuban husband
or jock or protector

832
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,488
or whatever
you want to call him.

833
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,390
They call him Uno.

834
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,459
He's got all sorts
of bizarre rules

835
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:29,999
and as long as I follow those
and behave like a lady

836
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,262
and as long as I follow those
and behave like a lady

837
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:36,032
at all times, he treats me
fairly well, I guess.

838
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,567
The whole prison
leaves me totally alone

839
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:40,503
being hooked up with him.

840
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,239
The problem is, I can never
take a break from my role

841
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,209
in the play as his woman,
and we have problems

842
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,511
when I grow tired of it.

843
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,414
This is my life
as Miss Wendy Castro

844
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:54,718
in the really dumb play
called prison.

845
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,098
Dr. Berland. Hi.

846
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,667
Bob Berland. John Middleton.
Nice to meet you.

847
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,402
Glad to meet you finally. How you doing?
Come on back.

848
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,637
Thank you.

849
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,243
Let me tell you what I
know of your history, Bob.

850
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,512
My understanding
is that you saw Mark

851
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,181
probably 1980ish, thereabouts.
I don't know exactly.

852
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,617
I think you were
working in Chattahoochee

853
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,152
or somewhere near there? Yes.

854
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:29,999
He had been sent there
because he was found.

855
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,321
He had been sent there
because he was found

856
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:32,989
incompetent to stand trial,

857
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,023
and you were the only
one that found him

858
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:38,061
to be competent, if I recall.
Is that right?

859
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:41,664
I'll tell you right off,
the report that I got

860
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:45,668
was very persuasive to Judge Minor.
Oh, absolutely.

861
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,338
But I'm going to just say this,

862
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:50,573
I think I was wrong. What?

863
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,375
I've done this for over 30 years

864
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:54,544
and I've learned a lot
about mental illness.

865
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:58,748
And people can be
manipulative looking

866
00:51:58,749 --> 00:51:59,999
and clever and they can
think and plan

867
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,085
and clever and they can
think and plan

868
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:03,620
and still be mentally ill.

869
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,754
And when I use the term
"mentally ill,"

870
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:08,324
I mean psychotic,
biologically broken.

871
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,660
You step back and you look
at the big picture.

872
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:14,697
This kid was doing things
and not being anxious

873
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,166
about doing them,
that were clearly harmful

874
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,669
to his legal situation
even though he appeared

875
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,438
to know they were harmful
to his legal situation.

876
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:26,075
He was very talkative even
in stressful situations,

877
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,999
in interviews after arrests
or attempted escapes.

878
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,047
In interviews after arrests
or attempted escapes.

879
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:36,085
He laughed and joked
and was talkative

880
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,187
after trying to shoot people
with zip guns.

881
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,590
He was loud and boisterous
and rowdy

882
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,725
and tore up his cell repeatedly.

883
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,460
Frequent complaints
about headaches

884
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:48,064
even at times when it would
not affect evaluations.

885
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:49,599
That's an important one.

886
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,502
Even in my report somewhere
I said that he was, you know,

887
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,570
he used plans
and he was organized,

888
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:59,999
but people can be planful in
the service of strange ideas.

889
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,210
But people can be planful in
the service of strange ideas.

890
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:01,744
Well, let me--
And let me tell you

891
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,246
my thoughts on where we're going

892
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:04,681
as far as Mark is concerned.

893
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,749
Mark, you know, the
Florida Parole Commission

894
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,317
has the authority over Mark

895
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,287
to release him
over anybody else.

896
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:14,023
I have gotten people out that
have done a lot worse things

897
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,391
than Mark DeFriest has done.

898
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,994
But we're going to have to get
the commission to parole him

899
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:22,765
with the understanding
that if he screws up,

900
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,000
they can yank that parole.

901
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:26,536
If we mislead them into thinking

902
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:29,539
they can deal with him
rationally,

903
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,000
then they work against us. Well,
I agree with that. Absolutely.

904
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:33,242
Then they work against us. Well,
I agree with that. Absolutely.

905
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,011
Because you can sit there
and say he can't help it,

906
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:37,380
it's the way he is.

907
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,515
And that, you know,
and there are--

908
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:43,687
And the downside to that is that
they don't like the way he is.

909
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:13,516
I do think that
Dr. Berland appears

910
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:16,185
to be a very
seasoned psychologist.

911
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,321
And when I say
a seasoned psychologist,

912
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:19,989
I think he is
a different psychologist

913
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,024
today than he was when he first

914
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,193
interviewed Mark many years ago.

915
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,362
And that happens to all of us.

916
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,999
I suspected from reading
my old documents from 1981

917
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,534
I suspected from reading
my old documents from 1981

918
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:34,670
that he probably
was mentally ill back then.

919
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,640
My problem is that
right now I have yet

920
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,177
to quantify it
to find objective data

921
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:45,582
that supported the day that
have to be the final arbiter.

922
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,093
Okay.

923
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,132
You can come in. I'm sorry.

924
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:14,070
I was just sound checking
the microphone here.

925
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,038
You guys must be all set.
Has he eaten?

926
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,040
Yes. Okay.

927
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,108
If he needs to go
to the bathroom,

928
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,110
do I just wave
my hands at someone?

929
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,413
Yeah. We're good. Okay. Thanks.

930
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,315
Let me just finish
setting this up

931
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,285
and then I'll explain
what's going on

932
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:29,999
and introduce myself again.

933
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,388
And introduce myself again.

934
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,392
Okay. I don't know
if you remember me.

935
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,096
We met back in 1981. I
was a lot younger then.

936
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:42,064
I remember you.

937
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,100
Let me just back up
a little and start with

938
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:47,003
why I'm even here today,
lo these many years

939
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:49,171
later, because I think
it would help you

940
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,575
understand where
I'm coming from.

941
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:59,415
It was my opinion now that my
opinion then was inaccurate.

942
00:56:59,416 --> 00:56:59,999
There were things
I didn't know then.

943
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,151
There were things
I didn't know then

944
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,387
that I know now
that would have made me

945
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:06,322
look at you differently.

946
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:08,324
Everything would have
been different.

947
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:10,626
Are you okay talking with me?

948
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,128
Sure.

949
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:13,663
Okay.

950
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:16,999
I'm going to read each of these
sentences to you one at a time,

951
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,201
and then you're going to tell me

952
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,270
if it's true or false for you.

953
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,173
All right. I like
Mechanics magazines.

954
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:25,675
Is that true or false for you?

955
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:28,511
True.

956
00:57:28,512 --> 00:57:29,999
I have a good appetite.

957
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,747
I have a good appetite.

958
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,483
True.

959
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:38,554
I wake up fresh and
rested most mornings.

960
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,357
False.

961
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:46,295
My daily life is full of things
that keep my interested.

962
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,130
False.

963
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,267
I believe I am being followed.

964
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:54,437
Definitely.

965
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:57,707
I feel that I have often
been punished without cause.

966
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,999
True.

967
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,243
True.

968
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:03,045
I love my father or
if your father is dead,

969
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,448
I loved my father.

970
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,383
True.

971
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:12,989
I am sure I get
a raw deal from life.

972
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,657
Yeah, that one's true.

973
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:18,327
That's true? Yeah. Life sucks.

974
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:22,264
Much of the time my head seems
to hurt all over. True.

975
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:25,501
I have not lived the right
kind of life. True.

976
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,738
I often hear voices without
knowing where they come from.

977
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:29,999
False. My sex life
is satisfactory.

978
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,374
False. My sex life
is satisfactory.

979
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,542
False. Even when
I'm with people--

980
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,745
I wish I were a child again.

981
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:38,247
When I get bored I like to
stir up some excitement.

982
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,417
I often wish I were a girl.

983
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,056
I'm afraid of losing my mind.

984
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,992
Absolutely.

985
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,229
My mother is a good woman

986
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,297
or if your mother is dead,

987
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,467
my mother was a good woman.

988
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:03,340
True, I guess.

989
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:09,546
My soul sometimes
leaves my body.

990
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:15,217
False, but I've been trying.

991
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,453
Lots of hallucinogenics.

992
00:59:17,454 --> 00:59:22,191
I am certainly lacking
in self confidence.

993
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:24,127
False.

994
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,064
I would like to be a florist.

995
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,532
Be a what? Florist.

996
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:30,000
Someone who works in a flower shop.
True.

997
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:33,103
Someone who works in a flower shop.
True.

998
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,308
That's it?

999
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,977
Well, that's it
for the test, yes.

1000
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,480
I think we'll just
end it for today

1001
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:47,149
and then we'll start up
again tomorrow.

1002
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,617
Do you have any questions?

1003
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:52,221
How is all this crap
relevant to my mental state?

1004
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:55,291
Well, I suspect if I am right

1005
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:58,294
about what I think
may be wrong with you,

1006
00:59:58,295 --> 00:59:59,999
that I may be able to make
your life a lot better.

1007
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,467
That I may be able to make
your life a lot better.

1008
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:08,737
Well, it was nice to see you again, Dr.
Berland.

1009
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:12,274
You're a gentleman to even
say it, but yeah, I'm--

1010
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,709
Yeah.

1011
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,411
You said I was--
What was it?

1012
01:00:15,412 --> 01:00:19,415
You said I was
a malingering idiot?

1013
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,585
Well, what can I say?

1014
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:24,753
There are things
that you do and say

1015
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:29,525
when you're young that you
then decide later were wrong.

1016
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:30,000
But where's the fairness in all this crap?
I mean, for real.

1017
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,294
But where's the fairness in all this crap?
I mean, for real.

1018
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,530
I went to prison
when I was, what, 20

1019
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:37,600
for doing a bunch
of stupid shit.

1020
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:41,570
I ain't never hurt nobody,
and here I am still.

1021
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:44,039
I've done 30 years
and got 30 more to go.

1022
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,742
Well, ain't that nice.

1023
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:58,554
This is his MMPI profile
from today.

1024
01:00:58,555 --> 01:00:59,999
This scale measures
all kinds of symptoms.

1025
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,491
This scale measures
all kinds of symptoms

1026
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,327
of mental illnesses
of all different types.

1027
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:09,331
Everything below this line is
the normal range essentially.

1028
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,967
It's 90 percent of the people

1029
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:16,038
who get those scores
are considered normal.

1030
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,706
So when it falls
above the score,

1031
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:21,710
it's proven to be
clinically useful as a tool.

1032
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:26,482
This score here on Scale L,
if he had had

1033
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,350
everything else
in the normal range,

1034
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,999
that score alone
would have told us

1035
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,086
that score alone
would have told us

1036
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:32,621
he had delusional
paranoid thinking.

1037
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:36,225
Especially somebody
this paranoid tends to do

1038
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,626
the preemptive strike thing.

1039
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,495
I'm going to get you
before you get me.

1040
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,030
Because he wants to feel like

1041
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,464
he's in control in a setting

1042
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:45,202
where everything tells you
you're not in control.

1043
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,138
Hello? John?

1044
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:51,740
Yes. Hey, it's Bob Berland.
I'm sorry to bother you.

1045
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,444
Can you talk a minute? Sure.
You're not bothering me at all.

1046
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:59,114
I saw Mark DeFriest today,
and we know from the MMPI

1047
01:01:59,115 --> 01:01:59,999
there's something out there.

1048
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,983
There's something out there.

1049
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:02,651
We're not just spitting
in the wind here.

1050
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,054
He really, this is a good MMPI

1051
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,488
and he's really mentally ill,

1052
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:09,658
and now I've got to develop it,

1053
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,126
and I don't want
to just go in there

1054
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,494
with one source of data
because they're not going

1055
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:16,732
to believe me.

1056
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,603
I think that at least,
in part, his problems stem

1057
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:22,972
from brain injury,
but I still have to prove that.

1058
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:24,974
At this point,
a lot of what I have

1059
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:27,209
other than the fact that
he's genuinely psychotic

1060
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,999
is intuitive and that isn't
going to stand up anywhere.

1061
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,160
Is intuitive and that isn't
going to stand up anywhere.

1062
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:40,089
Hi, doctor, how are you? Bob Berland.
Glad to meet you.

1063
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,691
Good to see you.

1064
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,431
Hi. Hi.

1065
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,033
Barbie Taylor, nice to meet you.
Glad to meet you.

1066
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:52,269
Come on in.

1067
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,373
Have a seat. Thank you.

1068
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,008
I get collateral data.

1069
01:02:59,009 --> 01:02:59,999
I like to get information
besides what I get

1070
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,077
I like to get information
besides what I get

1071
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:06,048
from the defendant themselves
because decision makers

1072
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:08,484
prefer to hear it
and it helps give me

1073
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:11,553
a check on truthfulness
and sometimes

1074
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,023
the mentally ill people
don't want to admit

1075
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:16,425
to what's wrong with them,
so I have to go around them.

1076
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:17,726
You shouldn't be intimidated.

1077
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,296
There's no right answer.

1078
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,399
I don't expect you to remember
things you can't remember.

1079
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,603
What kind of things did he do
to earn disciplinary reports?

1080
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:29,999
I would say that a number
of the disciplinary reports

1081
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,307
I would say that a number
of the disciplinary reports

1082
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:32,408
that were filed
against Mark DeFriest

1083
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,476
were false accusations.

1084
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,546
By staff? By certain staff.

1085
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,649
Were there
substantiated complaints

1086
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,351
against him as well?

1087
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:44,453
At times. They were minor.

1088
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:45,988
Okay.

1089
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:50,426
It was things like the kind
of language that he might use

1090
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,560
when he was being interviewed

1091
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,363
by a correctional officer.

1092
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:58,367
He talks about having
killed the president

1093
01:03:58,368 --> 01:03:59,601
and that's why he's in there.

1094
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,000
And he makes a joke
of that all the time.

1095
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,338
And he makes a joke
of that all the time.

1096
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,207
Okay. And that's kind
of an odd thing to say.

1097
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,977
Why do you-- do you have any
sense of why he says that?

1098
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,547
I think he's just being funny

1099
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:15,417
and he's using one last vestige

1100
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,987
of humor, you know,
where he finds it.

1101
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:19,989
I don't know.

1102
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:32,301
All right, gentlemen,
I agree, I admit it.

1103
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:34,070
I shot Lincoln.

1104
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,640
All right then.

1105
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,544
I'm going to ask you
some questions today.

1106
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,680
What I need to do
is get other data

1107
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,682
so that I can make a good case

1108
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,350
to whoever is going
to listen to this,

1109
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:51,019
whether it's in Florida
in the parole board

1110
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,521
or the medical staff here.

1111
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:56,158
This evaluation is about
finding out the truth.

1112
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,494
I told you the truth.
What I do to survive

1113
01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,999
is considered
unacceptable behavior.

1114
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,996
Is considered
unacceptable behavior.

1115
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,065
So now we're
at this point in reality

1116
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,967
where it really
doesn't matter anymore.

1117
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:09,738
So I'm just more interested
in what you've got to say.

1118
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,008
Well-- From a scientific
point of view.

1119
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:15,978
You know I'm a scientist, right?
I didn't, but--

1120
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:19,281
He'll tell you, man. I've done
a lot of firsts in prison.

1121
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:22,718
You do know that he played with a lot
of electricity. No, I didn't know that.

1122
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,021
Okay. He played
with electricity a lot.

1123
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:29,124
I mean, to the point
where he would, you know,

1124
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:29,999
rewire things, make things.

1125
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,127
Rewire things, make things.

1126
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:33,462
Sony built the Walkman.

1127
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,564
I built the Buttman in 1989.

1128
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:38,033
The what? The Buttman.

1129
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,668
I'm not even going to go there.

1130
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,003
You know, nowadays
they got all kind

1131
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,305
of little micro radio,
MP3 players and all,

1132
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,007
I mean, real small shit, right?

1133
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:47,009
There's all kind
of problems associated

1134
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,243
with first off, making a radio

1135
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,112
small enough
to keep it in your ass.

1136
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,613
And then the sound,
man, you want--

1137
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,048
You want something
that sounds decent,

1138
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,717
at least a graphic equalizer

1139
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,286
and everything else, right?

1140
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,720
I mean, I put
the whole radio together.

1141
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,721
It was about that big,
about the size

1142
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:00,000
of a big cigarette lighter.

1143
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:01,156
Of a big cigarette lighter.

1144
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,125
And like I said, Sony
made the first Walkman,

1145
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,395
but I made the first Buttman.

1146
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,571
Saturday night.

1147
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:17,973
They just counted
and I ripped off my G.I. Joe

1148
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:22,311
action battle assault pipe,
AC/DC rocking on Rock 105,

1149
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,546
"Highway to Hell."
I built a new micro.

1150
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,982
Her name is Suzy Q in honor of--

1151
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,017
Nazi motherfuckers murdered.

1152
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:29,999
I doubled my workout
to 500 jumping jacks,

1153
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,552
I doubled my workout
to 500 jumping jacks,

1154
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:33,355
500 situps, 500 pushups,
250 knee bends,

1155
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:36,191
and I am running two hours.
I may need it to survive.

1156
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:39,061
This place is a trip.
Flash to 9:24 P.M.

1157
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:43,132
I set the radio up,
Alice in Chains, "Man in a Box."

1158
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,370
Party tonight. A bomb landed.

1159
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,105
Four coffee bags,
half ounce of weed,

1160
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:54,109
crime goes on. G.I. Joe online.

1161
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:58,046
10:02 P.M., yes, yes, yes,
Gun N' Roses redoing.

1162
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,748
"Knocking on Heaven's Door,"
one of my all-time

1163
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:00,000
favorite songs. Sing it, Axl.

1164
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:02,218
Favorite songs. Sing it, Axl.

1165
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,724
Lift off, lift off.
Daddy's online early.

1166
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:09,691
Fuck it.

1167
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,426
Eddie singing
with David Lee Roth,

1168
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:14,029
Van Halen, tripping.

1169
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,099
I am drinking
a hot cup of coffee.

1170
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,133
Joy.

1171
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,434
Now reloaded.

1172
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,436
Pink Floyd, The Wall,
locked and loaded,

1173
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,105
waiting on tray pickup.

1174
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:25,274
They're starting showers
on the first floor.

1175
01:07:25,275 --> 01:07:27,142
♪ My love opens the heart ♪

1176
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,378
♪ My love opens the door ♪

1177

Sing it.

1178
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,313
Sing it.

1179
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:32,080
♪ My love opens the door ♪

1180
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,215
Awesome.

1181
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:37,386
Digital separation sound
by the Kinks, 1982.

1182
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,422
Saturday night madhouse,
tripping.

1183
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:41,523
Aliens plotting on me.

1184
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:43,126
So sad.

1185
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:50,465
Pink Floyd, lunatic, joy,
Suzy Q in her place.

1186
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,200
"Dark Side of the Moon."

1187
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:57,040
♪ I'll see you
on the dark side of the moon ♪

1188
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,011
Mark was strongly disliked

1189
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,447
by the goon squads,
and, of course,

1190
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,249
the more disciplinary
reports you get,

1191
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,018
the more serious
of a management problem

1192
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,220
you're considered,
and thus the more

1193
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,555
severely you're treated.

1194
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:17,559
I explained my suspected abuse

1195
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,062
by some correctional staff.

1196
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:23,565
The psychological and psychiatric
staff agreed with me.

1197
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,067
They said that they had noticed

1198
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:28,971
numerous times that
he had bruises or cuts

1199
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:29,999
and that each time
that the staff

1200
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,274
and that each time
that the staff

1201
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:36,044
had responded that Mark
was abusive to himself.

1202
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,512
That he had hurt himself.

1203
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:40,048
And it was immediately
laid out to me that

1204
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,084
there was nothing
they could do for him.

1205
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:46,655
Have you had periods
of time not caused

1206
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:50,559
by drug use or alcohol use

1207
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,594
or sleep loss where you would

1208
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:56,498
just seem to feel
unusually sluggish.

1209
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,166
I'm trying to tell you
about my headaches.

1210
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,999
I told you I get
real bad headaches.

1211
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,303
I told you I get
real bad headaches.

1212
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:02,537
And when I get real bad
headaches, like, yeah,

1213
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:04,973
I guess you can say
I get like that.

1214
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,575
I want to make sure
I've explored

1215
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,577
the headaches thoroughly.

1216
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:12,748
Were they frequent
or occasional but severe?

1217
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:15,584
I just remember him,
as he got older,

1218
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:17,052
as always having headaches.

1219
01:09:17,053 --> 01:09:18,387
And I can't give you an age

1220
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:20,022
when I thought they started,

1221
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:23,725
but I always remember
Mark and Excedrin.

1222
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,360
Did they start
at a certain point

1223
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,362
or did you have them for as long

1224
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:28,730
as you can possibly remember?

1225
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,999
Yeah. That's the answer
to that one.

1226
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,599
Yeah. That's the answer
to that one.

1227
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,002
Like, since I--
First conscious memory.

1228
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,303
I always had headaches.

1229
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,305
And do you wake up
with them or do you--

1230
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,174
Sometimes, yeah.
You know, I only sleep,

1231
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,110
like, two, three,
four hours a day.

1232
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,578
I sleep more than four hours

1233
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:47,282
and I wake up with a
monstrous ass headache.

1234
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,085
Are you aware of him
having any major blows

1235
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:52,688
to the head at any point,

1236
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,590
even if you didn't witness it?

1237
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,226
I'm not aware of that.

1238
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,999
Okay.

1239
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,229
Okay.

1240
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:05,000
What I am aware of
is only a hearsay.

1241
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,001
Okay.

1242
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:08,704
That Everett,
who was his father,

1243
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,306
would get home at night,
and Marilyn,

1244
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:15,410
who was his mother,
would have shaken him

1245
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:18,513
and said, you know,
I've had it with this child,

1246
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,382
you know,
and she would shake him.

1247
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,517
I believe firmly in my heart,

1248
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,053
he was shaken a lot.

1249
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,755
Have you ever heard
of shaken baby syndrome?

1250
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:28,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1251
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,758
Your brain sloshes around

1252
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:30,000
and it causes damage
even though your head

1253
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:31,593
and it causes damage
even though your head

1254
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,095
doesn't hit anything.

1255
01:10:33,096 --> 01:10:34,262
A lot of times when people

1256
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,031
have major falls,
even if they don't

1257
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:39,000
hit their head, they
suffer brain injury.

1258
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:41,636
How about when I flew out
of the Leon County Jail?

1259
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:44,606
I was on the third floor
and some Klingons

1260
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,141
were pointing some guns at me

1261
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:47,342
and they said,
"Stop or we'll shoot."

1262
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,645
I said, "Shoot, cocksucker"
and jumped?

1263
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,248
Does that count?

1264
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:58,687
They put me in an
all-black cell block.

1265
01:10:58,688 --> 01:10:59,999
There was 19 blacks in there,
and I'm the only white guy,

1266
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,723
There was 19 blacks in there,
and I'm the only white guy,

1267
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:03,558
and they tell me, they said,
listen, motherfucker,

1268
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,061
if this guy fucks up
and does anything wrong,

1269
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:08,231
we're taking y'all's TV
and canteen privileges.

1270
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:16,671
He is very much a loner.

1271
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:19,574
He wouldn't be comfortable
in crowds.

1272
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,710
He wouldn't be comfortable
in a store.

1273
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:25,447
He wouldn't be at all
comfortable in a group.

1274
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,983
I don't like
being around people.

1275
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:29,484
Okay. But specifically--

1276
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:29,999
I mean, a lot of people,
you get perceptions

1277
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,486
I mean, a lot of people,
you get perceptions

1278
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,421
of what people are going
to do or thinking--

1279
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,190
What kind of perceptions
would you get?

1280
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:37,058
But most of the time
I was right.

1281
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,560
And I'm not disputing that.

1282
01:11:38,561 --> 01:11:40,061
I just--I'm trying
to find out what--

1283
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,164
What it felt like to you.

1284
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:43,632
It just felt like
they would, you know...

1285
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,667
Like they were a threat to you?
Yeah.

1286
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:47,669
But I knew one of
the dudes in there.

1287
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,171
He was a dude
named Cecil Hunter,

1288
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:51,206
and he says, yeah, you know,
we're trying to escape.

1289
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:52,307
I said, that's a great idea.

1290
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,708
What do you got?
What are you doing?

1291
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,244
So they pull out
these HS12 Remedy DuPont

1292
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,647
carbon chip
diamond blades, right?

1293
01:11:58,648 --> 01:11:59,999
I said, how long
have you guys had these?

1294
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,183
I said, how long
have you guys had these?

1295
01:12:00,184 --> 01:12:01,383
Oh, we had them about a month.

1296
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:03,051
I said, what are
you still doing here?

1297
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,153
So I ripped the toilet
off the wall,

1298
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,489
took the damn
light fixtures apart,

1299
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:10,458
got some pipes and made
a dope barrel zip gun.

1300
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:12,728
So I started sawing the bars.

1301
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:20,602
It takes eight hours
to get through one cut,

1302
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:22,470
eight hours to get
through another cut,

1303
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:25,407
and I got to admit, things
were coming apart in there.

1304
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:26,708
A lot of them just
saying they were about

1305
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:29,345
to take that gun away from
me and stick it in my ass.

1306
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:34,683
So at 9:00 I made the
move and Bob Seger

1307
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:37,185
was on the TV playing
"Turn the Page."

1308
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:42,624
♪ Here I am on the road again ♪

1309
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,327
When you were escaping,
were you doing it

1310
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,095
as much for entertainment

1311
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,297
or because you really
thought you could get away?

1312
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:52,067
Coming to prison, you know,
it's like a big game.

1313
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:54,569
They say you can't,
and I say I can,

1314
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,373
and it's kind of funny.

1315
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,380
I landed in the girls'
exercise yard.

1316
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,983
I actually jumped up
and I flipped myself up

1317
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:09,251
on the top of the razor wire,

1318
01:13:09,252 --> 01:13:11,419
and I was so wired up,
I was two miles down

1319
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,988
the jail before I even realized

1320
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,991
I had broke both feet
and my wrists.

1321
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:24,300
I got a truck going and it
run through a roadblock.

1322
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:42,751
This cop pulls up right
behind me in a Ford Fairmont.

1323
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,286
I just put the thing in reverse

1324
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:46,121
and the truck
just climbed right up

1325
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,323
on top of the car
and smashed the roof down.

1326
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:49,591
And then they started
to blast the truck

1327
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,694
out from under me, man.

1328
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:54,629
I got down on the floor
and hit the gas

1329
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,133
and it got stuck
in somebody's living room.

1330
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,407
So they were really,
really upset, man.

1331
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,251
The reason I ask all
this is because

1332
01:14:16,252 --> 01:14:18,153
you talk about
you being a survivor,

1333
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:20,689
but it seems like
the things that

1334
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:23,458
you think you've done
to help you survive

1335
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,493
have caused you more trouble

1336
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,562
and that's what I'm
trying to understand.

1337
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,999
No, I'm still alive and lots
of people I know ain't.

1338
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,700
No, I'm still alive and lots
of people I know ain't.

1339
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:36,171
But if you had been able to
not do some of these things

1340
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:38,306
that got you in trouble
with the authorities,

1341
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,475
might you have been out
on the street sooner?

1342
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,711
Yeah. I'd been gone long ago.

1343
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:44,746
You know, if I was just a rapist

1344
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,582
or a murderer or something,
they'd let me out.

1345
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,319
I'm the idiot that made
them look like idiots.

1346
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,154
Hello. Hey.

1347
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,456
How'd it go? It was good.

1348
01:14:54,457 --> 01:14:55,991
Very good. Told them all
about the assassination

1349
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,460
of President Lincoln.

1350
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:05,266
I don't think
he's where he should be.

1351
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,968
I think he needs help
and I don't think

1352
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,370
he's where he should be.

1353
01:15:08,371 --> 01:15:09,537
And I don't think
he's going to get

1354
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,674
the help he needs where he is.

1355
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:29,999
This is the Florida
Parole Commission.

1356
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,159
This is the Florida
Parole Commission.

1357
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:36,464
This is the Hearing Room A
where three times a month

1358
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:40,468
hearings are conducted
for persons,

1359
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:43,605
inmates incarcerated
in Florida who are hoping

1360
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:46,474
to get paroled
at some point in time.

1361
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:50,412
The PPRD, that's the Presumptive
Parole Release Date,

1362
01:15:50,413 --> 01:15:57,052
and for this individual, it's
currently set for August 13th, 2082.

1363
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,999
And we are recommending, our
parole examiner is recommending--

1364
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,122
And we are recommending, our
parole examiner is recommending--

1365
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:04,692
They're requesting
an extension of 60 months.

1366
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,361
That is based on?

1367
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:08,096
His DRs. Okay.

1368
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:11,232
Those would be--
The DRs are the--

1369
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,301
Disciplinary Reports. Okay.

1370
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,636
And how many are here in this--

1371
01:16:14,637 --> 01:16:16,271
I think we have a total of 25

1372
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:18,106
from his last
subsequent interview.

1373
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:20,475
Okay, so those
are the types of things

1374
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:22,310
that the Commissioners
would be addressing

1375
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,612
tomorrow and making
their decision

1376
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,515
based on the inmate's behavior.

1377
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:29,999
After having read the file,
it's quite interesting.

1378
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,387
After having read the file,
it's quite interesting.

1379
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:34,190
Understatement.

1380
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:46,000
This is really the first
and only parole hearing

1381
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,136
that Mark has ever had.

1382
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,305
In 29 years, no one has ever

1383
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:52,040
attended a parole hearing of his

1384
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:55,410
because Mark has never felt

1385
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:58,646
there was any possibility

1386
01:16:58,647 --> 01:16:59,999
that he would ever get paroled.

1387
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,382
That he would ever get paroled.

1388
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:03,451
But this time, Dr. Berland,

1389
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,553
he has the information
to really try

1390
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:09,558
to help Mark, and it's
time to get him out.

1391
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,423
Tomorrow is
a ten-minute presentation.

1392
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,591
I'll take up about two or three,

1393
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,126
you can take up three or four,

1394
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,394
and you can take up a couple.

1395
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:49,230
The bottom line is,
what they would normally do

1396
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:52,200
looking at Mark's file
as it sits right now,

1397
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:54,269
they've got DRs there
where he's threatened

1398
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:59,374
to firebomb an officer
and do all kinds of things.

1399
01:17:59,375 --> 01:17:59,999
They've got DRs of that nature.

1400
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,409
They've got DRs of that nature.

1401
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,312
They generally would
at least extend him

1402
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:07,048
16 months, if not, 120 months.

1403
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,584
I mean, they'd take him
into the next century,

1404
01:18:09,585 --> 01:18:12,153
you know, based upon his record.

1405
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,155
Our plan is to ask
for your interview.

1406
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:16,457
Our plan is to ask
for a recommendation

1407
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:20,995
for a psychological counseling
and medication as directed

1408
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,398
by the counselors
as well as hopefully

1409
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:25,133
monitoring by you, Dr. Berland,

1410
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:27,569
as far as his prognosis.

1411
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,999
And, also, hopefully
they will knock off.

1412
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,738
And, also, hopefully
they will knock off

1413
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:34,976
some time to give,
to give Mark a sign.

1414
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:37,979
Yeah. He's without hope
at this point, totally.

1415
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,982
Well, I'm optimistic
of getting something.

1416
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:42,984
The perfect things
I told you the other day

1417
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:45,086
would get a parole date
down to 2015,

1418
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,589
give him a year interview,
and if that occurs,

1419
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:51,192
and Mark doesn't accept
that sign or olive branch,

1420
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,595
whatever, if that doesn't
happen after medication,

1421
01:18:53,596 --> 01:18:57,266
we can't really
do anything more.

1422
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:06,074
I'm Tena Pate
and I'm a parole commissioner

1423
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,108
for the state of Florida.

1424
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,377
I serve as the vice chair
on the commission.

1425
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:13,514
I do tons of research
on my cases.

1426
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:16,618
Mr. DeFriest, the offense
that he has committed,

1427
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:22,190
offenses he has committed,
he may well have been

1428
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:25,460
paroled long before now.

1429
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,495
I mean, we don't have
sex assaults,

1430
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,999
we don't have homicides.

1431
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,732
We don't have homicides.

1432
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:33,468
We don't have a lot
of the other violent crimes

1433
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:36,304
that really, you know,
are difficult to parole on.

1434
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:39,641
But, I mean, he has thousands
of entries in his record.

1435
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:42,243
Like, got 120 month
extension one year,

1436
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,612
240 months another time.

1437
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,015
And we're in control of it.
We can extend the date

1438
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:50,151
at some point if we need to
based on additional behaviors,

1439
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,087
or we can reduce that date.

1440
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:02,063
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.

1441
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:05,433
Welcome to this meeting of the
Florida Parole Commission.

1442
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:08,436
Before we begin, I'm going
to ask Chaplain Alex Taylor

1443
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:09,704
from the Department
of Corrections

1444
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:13,107
to lead us in an invocation,
if you'd please stand.

1445
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:15,243
Thank you.

1446
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,477
Let us pray.

1447
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,613
Justice is a very high
and lofty goal.

1448
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:21,449
Mercy is sometimes very risky.

1449
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,484
But the lives of men
and women wounded by crime

1450
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,653
are very precious
and dear to us all.

1451
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,722
We ask that mercy and justice

1452
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:29,999
stand close by
in our midst to guide

1453
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,125
stand close by
in our midst to guide

1454
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,460
each decision rendered
by the Commission today

1455
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,462
so that hope is not defeated,

1456
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:37,365
and the citizens
of Florida are well served.

1457
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:38,566
This is our prayer.

1458
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,469
Amen. Amen.

1459
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:42,704
I'm Commissioner Fred Dunphy.

1460
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:44,572
I'll be serving
as the Chair of the panel

1461
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,174
this morning,
and the panel consists

1462
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,709
of Commissioners Tena Pate

1463
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,077
and Monica David.

1464
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:51,179
If for some reason
they are unable to agree,

1465
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,349
the case will be referred
to me as chair of the panel.

1466
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,184
Commissioners,
are we ready to being?

1467
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,419
Absolutely.

1468
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,999
Commissioners, the first case.

1469
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,222
Commissioners, the first case

1470
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:06,027
I'd like to take is just
one case out of turn,

1471
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,629
and we'll call the case
of Mark DeFriest.

1472
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,499
It's on page 131.

1473
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,502
This is a subsequent
interview that occurred

1474
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:18,573
on September the 22nd of '08
at an undisclosed location.

1475
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:20,975
The examiner
is recommending an extension

1476
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:22,977
of 16 months based
on the receipt

1477
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:25,213
of numerous process
disciplinary reports.

1478
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:27,382
We'll be glad to hear
what you have to say.

1479
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,549
Thank you, Commissioners.

1480
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,999
This is a very difficult case.

1481
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,219
This is a very difficult case.

1482
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:33,054
I've represented Mark DeFriest
since he was 23 years old.

1483
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:34,489
He's now 49 years old.

1484
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,557
Since I've represented him,
I've had two children.

1485
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,693
One's in college,
and all this time

1486
01:21:38,694 --> 01:21:41,362
Mark has sat in prison
for crimes that normally

1487
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:45,099
a person would not spend
that much time in prison.

1488
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,302
And because of his behavior,
he has remained in prison.

1489
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:49,670
But what I do think,
Commissioners,

1490
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:52,507
is that Mark can do
what's necessary of him

1491
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:55,977
to at least be
considered for parole

1492
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:57,378
and he has not been able
to do that in the past.

1493
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,646
I recognize that,
and I'm not here

1494
01:21:58,647 --> 01:21:59,999
to even talk about
his prison record

1495
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,115
to even talk about
his prison record

1496
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:03,684
because that would be
silly for me to do so.

1497
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:07,288
Mark, when he pled
many years ago,

1498
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,724
there was a question
about his competency,

1499
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:12,193
and what's unusual
is the gentleman sitting

1500
01:22:12,194 --> 01:22:14,762
back to the right of me
is the person whose reports

1501
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,432
the court relied upon
in finding him competent.

1502
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:21,269
Dr. Berland would like to say a
few words for you if he could.

1503
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:25,139
I originally saw him in 1981
and at the time thought

1504
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,375
he was pretending
to be incompetent,

1505
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:29,999
and because of that, I thought
he was also not mentally ill.

1506
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,412
And because of that, I thought
he was also not mentally ill.

1507
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,714
And when I say mentally ill,
I mean psychotic.

1508
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:36,984
I evaluated him again
in 2009 with testing

1509
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:39,387
and interview
and both independently

1510
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:42,190
indicated a severe
psychotic disturbance.

1511
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:45,359
Psychosis is the result
of a biological malfunction

1512
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,529
in the brain, most often
from brain injury

1513
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:51,766
or inherited disorder
or as I think in his case,

1514
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,568
some combination of the two.

1515
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:57,472
I believe his bad behavior
in lockup from '81

1516
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,999
to the present has been
largely the result

1517
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,508
to the present has been
largely the result

1518
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:02,443
of this psychotic disturbance,

1519
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:05,146
especially the manic
paranoid part.

1520
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,382
There is no reason
not to try medicating him

1521
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:11,252
and see if he acts better,
including in a less closely

1522
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:12,753
confined setting in prison.

1523
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,455
I think I've said
everything I need to.

1524
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:16,057
Thank you.

1525
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:18,292
I'm Bonnie DeFriest. I'm
Mark DeFriest's wife.

1526
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,061
For the 15 years
that we've been married,

1527
01:23:20,062 --> 01:23:22,196
I've been Mark's
closest confidante

1528
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:25,733
and support person, his
lifeline, so to speak.

1529
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,268
He tells me if it wasn't for me

1530
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:29,971
he would have gone
over the edge long ago.

1531
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:30,000
We have a solid relationship.

1532
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:31,606
We have a solid relationship

1533
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:33,341
throughout which
I have shown him

1534
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,476
a deep personal commitment based

1535
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,278
on a profound soul level,

1536
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:40,748
love unconditionally,
and my entire focus

1537
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,483
and purpose has been
to help him heal,

1538
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,318
mentally, emotionally,
and physically.

1539
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,454
Because make no mistake
about it,

1540
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:48,656
Mark's incarceration
itself has added

1541
01:23:48,657 --> 01:23:50,424
to whatever psychiatric problems

1542
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:51,527
he came in with.

1543
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:05,139
People were dying
all around me, man.

1544
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:10,378
The goon squad was
killing people off the books.

1545
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:15,316
The State was killing people
legally, or so-called legally.

1546
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:18,519
43 people died when I was
in that special cell,

1547
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,655
one woman and 42 men.

1548
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:22,657
Ronald Straight, Danny Remeta,

1549
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:26,394
G. Stano, James Bundy
was my neighbor for a long time.

1550
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:27,662
I was in the cell
right above him

1551
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:29,196
when they barbecued
his dumb ass.

1552
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:29,999
It was just like the Wild
Wild West of Corrections.

1553
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,502
It was just like the Wild
Wild West of Corrections.

1554
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:36,671
It was a sad place.

1555
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:40,207
And it was just as I thought
that I might have the goods

1556
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,977
on this goon squad
and stop some of the beatings

1557
01:24:42,978 --> 01:24:45,112
that were going on,
I get this announcement

1558
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:48,649
that I'm going
to be moved to Orlando.

1559
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,418
And I know that
if things are really hot

1560
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:53,020
in Florida State Prison,
it wasn't a question

1561
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,623
of if an inmate
was going to be killed,

1562
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,726
but only when would it happen.

1563
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:05,232
"Saturday, July 17th, 1999.

1564
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,269
My dear honey,
they're gassing Frank right now.

1565
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:11,273
The exhaust fans just went off
and they locked all the doors.

1566
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,277
Frank is the one
on my left shoulder

1567
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,713
in the X wing photo
in the orange shirt.

1568
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:22,083
They're getting really wild
about their beatings these days.

1569
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:24,552
With Captain Thornton on set,
they may beat him to death.

1570
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:26,687
That cracker is crazy.

1571
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:29,023
Poor Frank.

1572
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:29,999
10:03, no action. All is quiet.

1573
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,526
10:03, no action. All is quiet.

1574
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,528
10:11 A.M. No action.

1575
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:36,564
Don't know what's going on.

1576
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:38,599
10:13, flash, here they come.

1577
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,234
Aliens on two west floor.

1578
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:42,036
I heard Thornton say,
are you ready to come out?

1579
01:25:42,037 --> 01:25:45,039
And he got
a 'Suck my dick, fuckboy.'

1580
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,174
So they went in and I hear them
beating the shit of him.

1581
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:48,676
He's fighting them hard.

1582
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:50,711
They got him in the hallway
beating on him still.

1583
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,447
Jumping up and down on him now.

1584
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,024
They killed him.

1585
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:04,458
Poor Frank.

1586
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:05,559
Poor man.

1587
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,062
Shiteaters beat him to death.

1588
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:10,398
It could have
just as easily been me.

1589
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:13,467
If you get this,
it'll be a miracle.

1590
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:16,071
I send all my love, Mark."

1591
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,208
It needs to be recognized

1592
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:23,678
that the Florida
Department of Corrections

1593
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,214
took a low-level,
non-violent prisoner

1594
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:29,999
and turned him into
what Mark DeFriest became

1595
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,152
and turned him into
what Mark DeFriest became

1596
01:26:30,153 --> 01:26:33,320
in the Florida prison system.

1597
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,757
We failed Mark DeFriest.

1598
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,062
Now that reliable
professional opinion

1599
01:26:41,063 --> 01:26:42,663
has been brought
to the forefront,

1600
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:44,398
we can finally
begin to help Mark

1601
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:49,336
change his behavior and his
life in a realistic way.

1602
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,206
Thank you. Thank
you, Commissioners.

1603
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:56,744
I think that this case
is a little bit

1604
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:59,999
different than
some of the others.

1605
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,048
Different than
some of the others.

1606
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:03,117
And certainly
under normal circumstances

1607
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:07,021
I would ask
for extension of his date,

1608
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:11,726
but because his date
is already so high,

1609
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,028
based on his age
and his tentative

1610
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:19,633
release date, I think that
I could make no change.

1611
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:25,005
And then I would be
willing to recommend

1612
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:27,274
to the Department of Corrections

1613
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:29,999
that they evaluate him
for mental health counseling

1614
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,712
that they evaluate him
for mental health counseling

1615
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:36,550
and also recommend, you know,
any psychotropic medications

1616
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,519
as needed.

1617
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,554
So I think
that would be my vote.

1618
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,556
I will agree with you
to make no change.

1619
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:45,426
I am pleased to see
that he has not had

1620
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:49,296
any disciplinary reports
since April of '08,

1621
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,198
I believe, but I understand

1622
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,000
he's doing this
without medication.

1623
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,502
You might have had
a good talk with him

1624
01:27:54,503 --> 01:27:57,738
to tell him not to engage
in these behaviors again,

1625
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:59,999
which is telling for me.

1626
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,408
Which is telling for me.

1627
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:05,045
So I don't doubt at all that
he has mental health issues.

1628
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:08,015
Whether or not they are
psychotic in nature

1629
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:09,350
is another issue.

1630
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:12,186
So because
of his extensive record,

1631
01:28:12,187 --> 01:28:14,488
I would like a two-year review.

1632
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:16,557
Give him more time to show us

1633
01:28:16,558 --> 01:28:19,093
that he has changed
because we have such

1634
01:28:19,094 --> 01:28:20,661
an incredible record of DRs.

1635
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:24,165
I don't think one year is
going to be enough for me.

1636
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:28,602
That's probably going to be in
y'all's best interest, too.

1637
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:29,999
I know you don't want
to hear that,

1638
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,069
I know you don't want
to hear that,

1639
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:31,338
but I'm okay
with the two-year review

1640
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:34,441
because, you know,
bureaucracy is bureaucracy,

1641
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:36,577
and I don't know
that we can accomplish

1642
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:40,181
what we want to accomplish
in this case within a year.

1643
01:28:40,182 --> 01:28:42,449
Right. So I think
Commissioner Pate's right.

1644
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,719
And, I mean, I think for him,
just getting a no change

1645
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,590
with all those DRs is something.
Exactly.

1646
01:28:49,591 --> 01:28:51,091
Thank you, Commissioners,
for the time.

1647
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,226
We appreciate it.

1648
01:28:52,227 --> 01:28:54,262
Thank you very much.
Thank you all.

1649
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:23,490
Hey, Mark. How you doing, man?

1650
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,458
All right.

1651
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:27,061
Have a seat, buddy. Still alive.

1652
01:29:27,062 --> 01:29:28,462
I can see that. How you been?

1653
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:29,999
I just made Level 3
in the system.

1654
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,664
I just made Level 3
in the system.

1655
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:32,566
I just got here last month.

1656
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,201
Is that the lowest level here?

1657
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,337
Yeah, there's a lot
of freedom here.

1658
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:38,038
They needed somebody
to paint their cellblock

1659
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:41,242
in the south unit up there, A3,

1660
01:29:41,243 --> 01:29:45,012
and I volunteered
and they gave me

1661
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:46,513
a job painting.

1662
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:49,250
They let me run a crew
and I recruited

1663
01:29:49,251 --> 01:29:51,051
two other guys and we painted

1664
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,353
the whole place for them.

1665
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:53,988
And you were commended by your

1666
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:55,522
classification officer,
right, how well you did?

1667
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:57,157
Yeah. He said I did
a real good job.

1668
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:59,999
Basically they gave me
a pizza party.

1669
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,263
Basically they gave me
a pizza party.

1670
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:04,365
Okay, Mark.
How come you've cut down

1671
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:08,135
this DR pattern that you have?

1672
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:10,504
Well, I never thought I was
ever getting out of prison.

1673
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:13,073
So, I mean, what is there

1674
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,609
but to live for the moment?

1675
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:17,678
But there is some difference now.
It matters.

1676
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,313
I mean, you've given me
the first glimpse

1677
01:30:19,314 --> 01:30:21,215
of, you know, having some sort

1678
01:30:21,216 --> 01:30:23,584
of normal life, you know?

1679
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:27,488
Getting out of here. Getting out
of here and watching the sun set.

1680
01:30:27,489 --> 01:30:29,999
You understand you can't use
an inmate's PIN number.

1681
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,425
You understand you can't use
an inmate's PIN number

1682
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:34,428
to make a phone call to call your wife.
Absolutely.

1683
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,096
And you understand that
you can't have apple juice

1684
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,631
in a Suave bottle.
You can't do anything.

1685
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:40,234
Do you understand that? Yeah. I
can't get any disciplinary report.

1686
01:30:40,235 --> 01:30:42,002
You can't get
any disciplinary reports.

1687
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:44,138
Are you willing to commit
to the commission

1688
01:30:44,139 --> 01:30:46,407
that you will do that
and absolutely understand

1689
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:50,277
that you can no longer
just exist for today,

1690
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:53,380
that you have to exist
for tomorrow and plan?

1691
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,515
Can you do that?

1692
01:30:54,516 --> 01:30:56,351
Yeah, I think I can.

1693
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:07,061
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.

1694
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:08,362
We're glad you're with us today

1695
01:31:08,363 --> 01:31:11,432
on this nice cold
morning in Tallahassee.

1696
01:31:11,433 --> 01:31:13,534
The first case
is Item 1, Page 1.

1697
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:15,436
Mark DeFriest.

1698
01:31:15,437 --> 01:31:17,538
Good morning, Mr. Middleton.
Good morning, Commissioners.

1699
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:19,540
How are you? Welcome.

1700
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:20,441
The examiner is recommending

1701
01:31:20,442 --> 01:31:23,143
an extension of 60 months

1702
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,212
due to process
disciplinary reports.

1703
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:26,280
For the record, Commissioners,

1704
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,082
the last time this case came up,

1705
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:29,999
he had 25 process DRs.

1706
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,452
He had 25 process DRs.

1707
01:31:31,453 --> 01:31:33,320
That's what he had,
and they were serious DRs.

1708
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,589
They weren't
telephone violations

1709
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:36,657
or anything of that nature.

1710
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,659
And what's happened,
Commissioners,

1711
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:43,731
it's this commission's actions
that has caused this change

1712
01:31:43,732 --> 01:31:45,499
in behavior for Mr. DeFriest.

1713
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,202
Right now
his parole date is at 2082.

1714
01:31:48,203 --> 01:31:51,472
This commission can take action
in this case to encourage him

1715
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:54,174
to continue on his path
of good behavior.

1716
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,642
He's trying to send you
a message.

1717
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:57,011
Why don't you send him one back

1718
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:58,212
and say we appreciate what you--

1719
01:31:58,213 --> 01:31:59,513
You're trying to do.

1720
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:00,000
It won't hurt
the commission at all.

1721
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:00,748
It won't hurt
the commission at all.

1722
01:32:00,749 --> 01:32:02,549
You know, I got to tell you.

1723
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,985
You know, Mr. Middleton
says that, you know,

1724
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:09,223
he's sending a message. Boy, that's a
funny message to send, getting DRs.

1725
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:12,259
Look, this case is very
frustrating for everybody,

1726
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,228
and, you know,
I heard of Mr. DeFriest

1727
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:15,396
the first time I took a tour,

1728
01:32:15,397 --> 01:32:17,398
before I even heard the case
out of Florida State Prison

1729
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:19,433
when I first got up here.
He's infamous, you know,

1730
01:32:19,434 --> 01:32:21,535
as an escape artist
and all this kind of stuff.

1731
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,070
What--
If you want--

1732
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:25,072
I just can't get past
the fact that we--

1733
01:32:25,073 --> 01:32:28,375
That what we did--we said
we'll take a pause,

1734
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,510
see what you can do
and he comes back

1735
01:32:29,511 --> 01:32:30,000
with this kind of behavior.
The--

1736
01:32:30,001 --> 01:32:31,545
With this kind of behavior.
The--

1737
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,646
It's not changing.

1738
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:35,182
It has changed, Commissioner.

1739
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:37,017
Okay. We're going to,
we're going to extend

1740
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:39,019
his date by 12 months.

1741
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,722
All right, Commissioners.
The next case--

1742
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:55,636
I always said he was
born at the wrong time.

1743
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:57,104
I always said
he should have been born

1744
01:32:57,105 --> 01:32:59,999
in the Wild ld West days
where they shoot 'em up,

1745
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,008
in the Wild ld West days
where they shoot 'em up,

1746
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:02,176
and I always thought
that when he died

1747
01:33:02,177 --> 01:33:05,679
he would go out shooting.

1748
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,415
I just wish...

1749
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,585
that things could have
been different

1750
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,755
and that he could have,
you know,

1751
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,425
been exposed to school
and been exposed

1752
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:22,296
to computers
as they came out and--

1753
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:24,298
And to everything
that's happened

1754
01:33:24,299 --> 01:33:29,136
in 27 and 3/4 years,
like he said.

1755
01:33:29,137 --> 01:33:29,999
Can you imagine what that
brain could have done?

1756
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,240

brain could have done?

01:33:45,487 --> 01:33:49,690
but I still feel sorry
for the kid, you know?

1761
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:51,593
And he's no kid no more.

1762
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:57,264
I was a young dumb kid
when I came to prison.

1763
01:33:57,265 --> 01:33:59,500
You couldn't really talk to me
or tell me anything, you know.

1764
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:00,000
I didn't--
I wasn't willing to listen.

1765
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:02,569
I didn't--
I wasn't willing to listen.

1766
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:04,104
But look at me now. I'm old.

1767
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:08,408
I've got gray hair and wrinkles
and hearing aids and, you know?

1768
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:10,611
I've been in prison 30 years.
I'm tired.

1769
01:34:10,612 --> 01:34:12,513
I want to just be left alone.

Gabriel London.

1776
01:34:48,616 --> 01:34:50,083
We've had a chance to tour
around with the film

1777
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:51,418
particularly in Florida.

1778
01:34:51,419 --> 01:34:53,120
This is the ballot box
that asked audiences

1779
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:56,089

have all seen the film

1786
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:13,073
and they've decided
to meet again.

1787
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:14,374
In just a couple of weeks.

1788
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:17,579
To consider an early parole date
for Mark DeFriest.

1789
01:35:19,247 --> 01:35:22,082
Good morning, everyone. We're
glad you're with us today.

1790
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:25,319
We have some high-profile
cases on the docket.

1791
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,989
It is my position
that Mr. DeFriest

1792
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:29,999
is a prisoner of his own making

1793
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,325
is a prisoner of his own making

1794
01:35:31,326 --> 01:35:32,659
so my vote here would be

1795
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:36,296
to make no change to the PPRD

1796
01:35:36,297 --> 01:35:39,266
of August 13, 2085.

1797
01:35:39,267 --> 01:35:43,437
My vote is to reduce
his date by 845 months

1798
01:35:43,438 --> 01:35:47,374
for a PPRD of March 13, 2015.

1799
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:50,110
Thank you.

1800
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:51,111

Thank you. Thanks.

1802
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,249
Mark DeFriest was 19
when he was sent to jail.

1803
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,218
On Wednesday, the commission
on offender review

1804
01:35:58,219 --> 01:35:59,999
cut his release date
from 2085 to next year.

1805
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,289
Cut his release date
from 2085 to next year.

1806
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:03,423

1855
01:38:59,567 --> 01:39:00,000
Yeah, right. You know it.

1856
01:39:00,001 --> 01:39:01,001
Yeah, right. You know it.

1857
01:39:01,002 --> 01:39:03,603
