what you're thinking, but no.

163
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:22,801
I'm too good for this town.
Men are fucking useless, no offense.

164
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:24,702
[GRAHAM] None, none taken.

165
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,539
[DAHLIA] Yeah, I'll worry about that another time.
For right now, they're just fun to play with.

166
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,260
One day I'll move out to Paris and
I'll live in a beautiful apartment  

167
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,861
with a balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower

168
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:42,162
and I'll sit out there in the mornings
so I'll watch the sunrise,

169
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:45,963
I'll drink tea, eat incredible food that

170
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:50,464
I'll post every day to make my haters rage

171
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:58,365
and maybe I'll meet some nice French guy
named Pierre, Remy.

172
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:01,266
[GRAHAM] Like the rat?

173
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,567
[DAHLIA] It's my dream life, not yours
[GRAHAM] Sorry...sorry

174
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:10,268
[DAHLIA] But this guy is gonna be perfect, nothing less.

175
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:12,769
He'll come over every day and

176
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,570
we turn on the radio and listen to some oldies
and dance in the kitchen

177
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:21,571
like we're the only two
left in the world.

178
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,559
We'll never get sick of hearing each other's stories
about what happened that day

179
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,960
or what we're going to do the next day because

180
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,361
with each other looking into each
other's eyes

181
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,562
that's the only place we want to be.

182
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,440
[GRAHAM[ That's, you know, that's amazing.
[DAHLIA] I know, thanks.

183
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,039
[DAHLIA] Okay we should do this again you're fine.
[GRAHAM] I agree

184
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,640
[DAHLIA] All right, I'll see you soon
[GRAHAM] See you Dahlia!

185
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,419
- Are you seriously still dying in bed?
[ALICE] What the hell are you on this morning?

186
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,020
Usually you're dying right next to me

187
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:22,121
and then we play rock, paper scissors, shoot
and you make me mimosas.

188
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,800
- Well, Dahlia came by earlier,
she forgot her coat or something

189
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:27,801
and then we went out and got some food.

190
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,039
[ALICE] That's cute. What did you guys talk about?

191
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,440
[GRAHAM] Just things, stuff. stuff

192
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,799
[ALICE] Okay fine. Don't tell me
[GRAHAM] Are you seriously getting offended?

193
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,800
[ALICE] Please leave a message for Alice after the beep.
Beep.

194
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,840
- How long do we have to stay there?
[ALICE] Forever, we're moving.

195
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:05,980
Seriously though, if you keep complaining about
this party i'm going to get your ass

196
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:08,481
[GRAHAM] I know, I know.
I just don't know anybody there

197
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:12,482
[ALICE] Jackson's going
[GRAHAM] No, no, no, not bug collector Jackson

198
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:15,883
JESS] He's the kid who brought the bug to class last year
[[GRAHAM] oh absolutely not

199
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:16,884
[ALICE] You're gonna be fine champ

200
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:20,085
[GRAHAM] You know if he brings abug i swear to God
I'm leaving. I'm going to.

201
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,660
[GRAHAM] So why isn't Cassie coming anymore?

202
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:27,661
[JESS] I guess she's on some boat with this guy
she just met

203
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:30,662
[ALICE] Ooh
[JESS] You know what they say about the summer time

204
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:35,099
[ALICE] Oh yeah, I mean if a guy has a boat you gotta go.
I don't blame her one bit

205
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,620
[JESS] Oh absolutely. A man with a boat I hope he's the one  

206
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:40,821
[ALICE] I mean, if he's got a boat, he is the one.

207
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:46,622
Remember the time that Cassie used tip off
the side of the boat last year

208
00:24:46,623 --> 00:24:49,723
[JESS] Yeah she's always a fool
making a straight up fool of herself

209
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,420
Maybe we'll find you the one today Graham,
who knows?

210
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:56,521
[ALICE] Oh yeah all the pretty babes in bikinis,
find your soulmate.

211
00:24:56,522 --> 00:24:58,222
[JESS]  Jackson for one?

212
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,978
- What are you doing?

213
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:17,339
Are you actually sleeping right now.
We are at a party and you're asleep.

214
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,740
- No, no
- Get up Graham, get up!

215
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:23,541
- Noooooo

216
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,559
[GRAHAM] Hey
[JESS] Hi

217
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,660
[GRAHAM] Do you want to get going soon?
[JESS] Right now?

218
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,239
[GRAHAM] I mean like now
[JESS] I'm having fun, just a little longer?

219
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,740
[GRAHAM] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[JESS] All right, okay

220
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:40,941
- Okay

221
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,100
[GRACE] Watch out!

222
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,380
I'm so sorry
[GRAHAM] It's fine, I think I'll survive.

223
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:13,081
- I'm Grace
- I'm Graham

224
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:15,582
[GRACE] Wait, are you serious?
[GRAHAM] You heard me.

225
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:18,283
[GRACE] You really gave the entire team chickenpox

226
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:20,784
totally sabotaging any chance at the championship?

227
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:22,685
[GRAHAM] Yep
[GRACE] That is incredible.

228
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:24,386
[GRAHAM] Yeah

229
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:27,526
[GRACE] You're pretty cool Graham.
[GRAHAM] You are too.

230
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:36,316
[ALICE] Graham, mama's drunk and I wanna go.

231
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:38,817
[GRAHAM] Yeah, Yeah. That...that's my cue.

232
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:42,318
[GRACE] Will I see you again?
[GRAHAM] Yeah, I can make that happen.

233
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:53,231
[ALICE] Yep, and you're driving.

234
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,439
[GRAHAM] Here we go.

235
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,140
Goodnight Alice.
[ALICE] *mumbles* Goodnight.

236
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,640
- So is Dahlia coming or what?
[GRAHAM] No, no. I don't think so.

237
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,079
- Where's the dragonfly bracelet i got you? I made you?

238
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,280
[GRAHAM] I lost it. I don't know, it desappeared...

239
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:52,881
[ALICE] You lost it? [GRAHAM] I obviously...
[ALICE] You don't know? I spent like 50 hours...

240
00:27:53,082 --> 00:27:54,882
Hey, hey what's up?

241
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:58,383
[JESS] Just got back from my new tattoo appointment

242
00:27:58,484 --> 00:28:01,984
[ALICE] Oh shit, look at that
[CASSIE] It's really so pretty

243
00:28:01,985 --> 00:28:03,485
[JESS] Thank you so much
[CASSIE] I like it

244
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:06,186
[ALICE] Why the dragonfly?
[JESS] Well you know my cousin Connor, 

245
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:08,487
he's like going through a hard time right now

246
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:12,588
and we just kind of talked about like
the dragonfly and how transformative it is

247
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:14,389
and that really resonates with me

248
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,590
and so we scheduled these appointments then,
you know

249
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:19,391
[GRAHAM] Wow!!
[ALICE] That, it looks cool right

250
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:20,892
[JESS] Yeah and it looks pretty cool

251
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:23,493
[CASSIE] Graham I heard you hung out
with Dahlia the other day

252
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,480
[GRAHAM] Yeah she she got me so hungover...
I was dead, I was...

253
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,059
[CASSIE] I love her, she's so sweet,
you're gonna get along so well with her..

254
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,860
[GRAHAM] Yeah...

255
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,439
[DAHLIA] So how's grace?

256
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,740
[GRAHAM] Uhm... I haven't seen her since the party
[DAHLIA] Why's that?

257
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,341
[GRAHAM] I don't know. I've been busy. 

258
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,460
[DAHLIA] Busy? Busy with what?
You're 21, this isn't the time to be busy.

259
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,940
What's up?

260
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,520
Okay, all right. Come on! Come on!  

261
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:04,121
Ever since I was in high school,
it's always been my favorite thing

262
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:09,122
to just come down to the ocean and
admire how big the world is around me.

263
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,759
For a moment i feel so infinite yet so small.

264
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,860
At the same time all my thoughts
and my anxieties

265
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:23,161
just seem to be absorbed by the ocean
and the sky

266
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,562
and I like go.

267
00:29:28,263 --> 00:29:31,763
[SCREAMS]

268
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,940
[GRAHAM] Whoa whoa what the what the hell is that?
[DAHLIA] Try it!

269
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,641
[GRAHAM] Screaming?
[DAHLIA] Yes, try it!

270
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,042
[GRAHAM] You wanna me scream?
[DAHLIA] Yes, try it!

271
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:44,443
[BOTH SCREAMING]

272
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,819
[DAHLIA] What did you feel like when you met Grace?

273
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,120
[GRAHAM] What do you mean?

274
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,921
[DAHLIA] Like how did you know?

275
00:29:57,222 --> 00:29:58,822
[GRAHAM] It was that night at the pool.

276
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:02,023
I don't know we were talking and

277
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:04,024
sitting on the edge,

278
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:08,425
she kept getting closer and we kissed

279
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,859
[DAHLIA] No way!

280
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,839
[GRAHAM] Yeah, but I...uhm...I didn't feel any different.

281
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,740
[DAHLIA] What do you mean?

282
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,940
- You know when people tell you about
something you haven't experienced yet, 

283
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,959
a feeling you haven't experienced yet or something

284
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,740
you look forward to it so much,  

285
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:49,141
but when it finally happens
it's totally underwhelming and

286
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,259
the opposite of what you expected it
to feel like.

287
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:56,759
That was when we kissed

288
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,959
I expected all the universe's questions
to be answered then

289
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,460
and to understand everything.

290
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
- Maybe she isn't the one.

291
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,339
- Or maybe she can't be.

292
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,020
When i was 13,
my mom told me it was just puberty.

293
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,439
She said don't worry Graham, go to bed,

294
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,340
they're just bad thoughts, they'll be gone in the morning...

295
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,860
but they never were.

296
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,719
It's been eight years and
they still haven't.

297
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,420
I used to look in the mirror

298
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:55,821
and the boy staring at me would be terrified.

299
00:31:56,922 --> 00:31:58,122
I saw a boy,

300
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,500
and on the outside he was just
like any other boy,

301
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,239
but... but he knew really,
when really looked into his eyes,

302
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,440
really saw who he was,  

303
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:17,641
he couldn't figure out how,

304
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,100
he couldn't figure out why he was different.

305
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,580
He couldn't accept himself, 

306
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:30,481
he yearned for the validation of others,
struggled to find the right girl

307
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:34,682
and when he finally met one,
he thought she would have all the answers,

308
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,120
she would be the one...

309
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,860
she would be the one that
would help everything make sense,

310
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,660
she would...she would be the one
to make the struggle worth it.

311
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,260
But she wasn't.

312
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,459
She couldn't be,
she could never be the one.

313
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,060
[DAHLIA] What are you saying Graham?
[GRAHAM] I'm saying I'm terrified.

314
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:07,361
[DAHLIA] Why? 
[GRAHAM] Because I'm scared of who I am.

315
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:11,080
[DAHLIA] Or are you afraid that
you can finally be who you are?

316
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:15,699
[GRAHAM] What if i don't want,
what if i don't want this?

317
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,140
I just don't know what.
I...I just don't know what I want.

318
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:31,219
I'm waiting for someone to give me
the answers, anything and...

319
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:36,159
nobody's giving me the right answers.

320
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,980
[DAHLIA] That's because no one can figure out
who you are except for you.

321
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,860
You have to find out for yourself.

322
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:49,161
You know who you are but,
when it's your time,

323
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:52,162
you can tell the world
or you don't.

324
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,680
Who cares how long it takes you to figure it out.

325
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,640
[GRAHAM] When will I know?

326
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:00,841
[DAHLIA] As soon as you're ready
to accept the love you deserve.

327
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,699
My thing is: life is short.

328
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:10,200
Allow yourself to feel,  allow yourself
to get hurt and be confused.

329
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,439
You're human,
but never be discouraged by the hurt.

330
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:23,140
It takes some people a lifetime to figure out
who they are, where they're going and

331
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,341
who they want to take with them.

332
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:29,359
Life is weird,
you just gotta let yourself love.

333
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,219
I hate this country, its culture.

334
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,320
People sticker label after label
to their bodies, to their brains,

335
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:45,621
until they completely suffocate
the real-life person underneath.

336
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,920
Labels mean nothing,
they're just a way to generalize.

337
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,499
We're so obsessed with fitting in that

338
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,600
we forget that people
are never one-dimensional.

339
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,080
You shouldn't have to define yourself,

340
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:04,881
you should just be allowed to be.

341
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,239
In our crazy messed up world,

342
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,640
if you're different,
you just have to tell everyone.

343
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
[GRAHAM[ I just don't know if I'm ready.

344
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:20,661
[DAHLIA] I'm not saying you have to announce it,

345
00:35:21,962 --> 00:35:25,062
let alone even know yourself,

346
00:35:26,263 --> 00:35:28,163
but for people like Grace

347
00:35:28,964 --> 00:35:31,064
make sure not anyone get hurt.

348
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,100
Every day I wake up   

349
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,601
and look at myself in the mirror
and think

350
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,159
if I died today would I be happy
with how I lived? Did I live authentically?

351
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,919
Your heart's going to die one day Graham,
but your soul will live on.

352
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,720
And you nor anyone else

353
00:35:55,721 --> 00:36:01,921
won't ever be able to touch or love
your body ever again.

354
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:08,339
Be free and enjoy it while you can,
it's your only one.

355
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,519
[ALICE - VOICEMAIL] Hey Graham I'm not home right now because

356
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,320
I'm currently with Cassie grabbing some last minute
things for tonight.

357
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,220
I completely forgot that we moved
Jess's birthday celebration

358
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:52,321
to this weekend  and not next weekend.

359
00:36:52,322 --> 00:36:55,422
So hopefully your suit is ready.

360
00:36:56,223 --> 00:36:58,323
Her and her cousin are coming
over at like six

361
00:36:58,324 --> 00:37:01,224
so if you could please, please, please,
please clean the kitchen

362
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:04,225
so i don't start stress vomiting,
that'd be great.

363
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:07,939
All right, thank you, so much.
Cassie and I'll be there ASAP, okay, bye.

with this chicken.

[GRAHAM] Thank you, I, what? Was cooking it for
like two, three hours?

[GRAHAM] What?

389
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:04,822
[ALICE] You know you bought that chicken from Hannaford's

390

the chicken from Hannaford's, that's true

but like..I...I...

when you get..ah, ah...
this girl got so drunk,

409
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:06,785
her boyfriend had to drag her ass off the bar

410
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:09,786

this one's ex-boyfriend, let me tell you

416
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:29,592
[CONNOR] Yeah, yeah. My ex-boyfriend almost...
uhm... ran me over with the bus one time so...

- Wow...
[GRAHAM] What?

418
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,094

[CONNOR] Really

422
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:54,229
[JESS] Yeah
[ALICE] We could hook him up with someone!

423
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,530
[CONNOR] Yeah I'm just kind of waiting
for the right one,  you know

424
00:40:57,631 --> 00:41:01,631
[ALICE] No, you just need a hook up
[CONNOR] Yeah you're right

425
00:41:01,632 --> 00:41:03,932
[CASSIE] Oh yeah, there's going to be tons of guys there
[ALICE] Oh, yeah.

426
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:06,733
[CASSIE] Like you're going to find the right man
[Connor] Really?

427
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,534
[ALICE] Dude they're so hot, it's honestly unfair.
Like they're so hot like.

428
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:15,735
[CONNOR] Yeah, no, I've never been to a gay bar before so.
[ALICE] What? How have he and you haven't? Oh my god.

429
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,639
[CONNOR] Hey.
[GRAHAM] Hey.

430
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,480
[CONNOR] How are you?

431
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:35,699
[GRAHAM] I'm pretty good, how are you?

432
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,039
[CONNOR] Good

433
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,800
The stars are a beautiful thing, aren't they?

434
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:50,239
[GRAHAM] Yeah, they're little dots away that people use to connect

435
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,640
and make shapes and images it's...uhm...
it's beautiful.

436
00:41:56,959 --> 00:42:00,939
[CONNOR] The human mind is a beautiful thing too isn't it?
[GRAHAM] Yeah

437
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,240
[CONNOR] People get so lost in themselves,
lost in their lives that

438
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:19,519
they forget we can just take a step back and
look at the stars

439
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,320
and realize how small we really are,

440
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,140
how insignificant everything is.

441
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,300
It's so easy not to

442
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:39,219
follow your heart,

443
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,119
lose sight of who we are,

444
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,020
to forget what it's like to be

445
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:53,699
blissfully and brutally human

446
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,800
but

447
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:05,001
we don't even allow ourselves to be happy.

448
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,239
[GRAHAM] Are you happy?

449
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:27,459
[CONNOR] I try to do everything i can
to be happy and to feel alive but

450
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,860
not everyone agrees with it

451
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,840
but life's too short right?
[GRAHAM] Right.

452
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:52,820
[ALICE] Graham, you gotta come join the actual party
and we're...forget it...

453
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:54,921
[CONNOR] Hey do you need help with 
any of the dishes or anything?

454
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:56,622
[GRAHAM] Oh no, no.I think i'm all good

455
00:43:56,623 --> 00:43:58,823
[CONNOR] Also...uhm...do you know where the girls coats are?

456
00:43:58,824 --> 00:44:04,024
[GRAHAM] Umm...they're up on the third floor and...
uhm... it's like the first room

457
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:06,925
[CONNOR] Do you mind just helping me?
[GRAHAM] Sure, yeah okay, okay.

458
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,199
[CONNOR] Where are they?
[GRAHAM] Right over there.

459
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,400
[CONNOR] Over here?
[GRAHAM] Yep

460
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:38,939
[CONNOR] A dragonfly pendant?
[GRAHAM] Yeah, my mom gave it to me, when i was nine.

461
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,640
That's when she gave it to me
after my grandma passed away

462
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,100
[CONNOR] I'm sorry

463
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:46,501
[GRAHAM] The dragonfly is a family symbol.

464
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,700
That was my grandma's favorite creature and
we just kind of adopted it.

465
00:44:51,701 --> 00:44:55,801
As I've grown up I've seen
dragonflies everywhere:

466
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,280
on my way to school, concerts, baseball games,

467
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,520
it's just nice, she's always looking down on me

468
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:11,321
[CONNOR] Yeah, she's always protecting you.
[GRAHAM] Yeah, exactly.

469
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:13,422
[CONNOR] That's beautiful...

470
00:45:18,123 --> 00:45:20,923
You know  the dragonfly also means transformation.

471
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,519
You're like a dragonfly, you attract positive change

472
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,540
On the inside of you, dancing with you

473
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,019
you are capable of loving and capable of living, but

474
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,640
it's the moment you allow yourself to dance on the outside,

475
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,241
it's the moment you grow wings

476
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:52,779
[GRAHAM]  What if, what if what's on the inside is scary,
scarier than living a lie?

477
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:00,280
[CONNOR] You're supposed to be scared, you're human.
Are you afraid of me?

478
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:02,581
[GRAHAM] That's what I keep telling myself.

479
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,640
[CONNOR] Oh. I should go. [GRAHAM] Yeah.

480
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,219
[DAHLIA] So how did you know?

481
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,420
[GRAHAM] Since the seventh grade.

482
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:05,039
I started getting these really intrusive thoughts,

483
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,040
you know like... it was normal.

484
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,800
I grew up listening to what other people
were saying and

485
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,801
I knew it was a part of life

486
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,380
but what i didn't realize

487
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:26,481
was that the other boys had different thoughts.

488
00:47:27,582 --> 00:47:30,182
I just thought everyone was like me.

489
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,979
But when i truly knew
It was the day i fell in love.

490
00:47:42,379 --> 00:47:43,780
His name is Peter.

491
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:49,181
We had been best friends since second grade,
we did everything together:

492
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,119
we played video games,

493
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,520
we talked for hours about
everything and nothing at the same time;

494
00:47:57,319 --> 00:47:59,940
you couldn't, you couldn't separate us.

495
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:06,541
Around junior year is
when I started to recognize my feelings

496
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:15,200
and I knew that I wanted us to be more than friends,
more than best friends

497
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,000
and I put myself into this cycle of self-loathing

498
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:22,801
and it took me, it took me years to get out of it.

499
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:29,260
I'll always remember how hard I...I fell for him
and how...how much i truly loved him

500
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,540
and him and his girlfriend are so adorable
but I'm jealous,

501
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,300
and I'm not jealous of them you know, it's...

502
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:46,640
it's that mutual love that they
have for each other, it's just...

503
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,579
I'll always remember how he made me feel.

504
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,280
He...he was in my life for a reason

505
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:59,459
He helped me discover a part of myself 

506
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,460
and...and I'll forever be thankful for that.

507
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,840
[DAHLIA] You're a beautiful human Graham.

508
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:13,341

you gave the world right back to you.

[GRAHAM] I don't know 

516
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,620
[DAHLIA] Should I wear a dress?
[GRAHAM] No, that way is too formal

517
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:48,821
[DAHLIA] Really?
[GRAHAM] Yeah

518
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:53,922
[DAHLIA] Do you think it's too formal...uhm...what jeans?
[GRAHAM] Uhm...yeah, yeah I think that works.

as he even deserves to see me at all.

I shouldn't even go, I shouldn't even go

I'm doing too much.

Honestly, the human faces are already so beautiful

532

add things to enhance our beauty.

[GRAHAM] Yeah, yeah.

[CONNOR] I just wanted to talk about the other night.

547
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,020
You know that night I met you at...uhm..

548
00:55:14,421 --> 00:55:17,321
.the train tracks,
when I patched up your knee.

549
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,600
and you overheard a phone call...

550
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,960
Well...uhm

551
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:30,040
That was my mom and

00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:40,920

After I dropped off the girls

555
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,700
I came back home and
my dad  was waiting up for me

556
00:56:03,101 --> 00:56:04,001
and

557
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,119
next to his feet were bags of all my things.

558
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,620
He basically told me that I was a disappointment

559
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:22,621
and an embarrassment and that

560
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:28,299
I'm no longer his son so...
I can't go back.

Do you have anywhere to stay?

I've been staying with Jess on her floor but

564
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:48,100
I can't burden her about further, so...

uhm...I've been meaning to go for a while, so...

569
00:57:07,823 --> 00:57:10,423
[GRAHAM] That's bullshit! He's your dad

570
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:13,324
he shouldn't have the right
to kick his own son out

[GRAHAM] Let me grab up your towel, okay?

574
00:57:52,259 --> 00:57:55,059
[CONNOR] I used to ask myself that question constantly:

00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,720
Who am I?

576
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:09,019
I spent all the time expecting other people
to answer that question for me

577
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,020
and I...

578
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,180
I never thought that I'd be able
to solve my own problems,

579
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:21,881
answer my own questions

580
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:24,282
but

581
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:28,983
now I just listen to my heart

582
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,000
and let it guide me.

583
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,300
Life's a lot more fun that way.

584
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:49,801
It's...

585
00:58:51,502 --> 00:58:54,002
It's funny how much you learn
about yourself when

586
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:02,779
you listen to your heart,
discover more things about yourself.

587
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,680
[GRAHAM] I...I try listening to myself

588
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,239
my heart tells me one thing and
my mind tells me other

589
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,040
and I never know which one to listen to.

590
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:22,440
How do you know which one is right?

591
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,840
[CONNOR] I listen to my heart.

592
00:59:27,341 --> 00:59:31,941
My mind is like this massive knot of 

593
00:59:33,242 --> 00:59:37,142
billions of like thoughts
and opinions and ideas

594
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,219
but people can and will control

595
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,460
your mind and play with it,

596
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:48,361
but you can always choose to listen to your heart.

597
00:59:48,662 --> 00:59:51,162
You know?
[GRAHAM] Yes

598
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,799
[CONNOR] Your heart knows when you're happy,
when you're sad, when you're scared 

599
00:59:57,339 --> 00:59:59,999
when you're nervous or when you're excited. 

600
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:05,100
That's why heartbreak is one of
the worst feelings to go through

601
01:00:06,601 --> 01:00:10,101
and when I wasn't accepting who I was,
that's exactly how I felt.

602
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,559
I had this horrible feeling in my heart

603
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,979
every single day because I was  

604
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:36,480

would rather get rid of than keep,

some freak accident,

606
01:00:41,461 --> 01:00:44,661
at least that's how my dad felt, but

607
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,999
I used to always question is it worth it?

608
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,520
Is this gonna get better? And...

609
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:59,121
questioned if i even knew what i was doing

610
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:00,922
but

611
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:08,019
the night when we kissed
everything made sense.

612
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:15,099
You felt like a hand that wiped away
all the tears that I ever cried

613
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,299
it felt like

614
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,240
you took away all the bruises
and wounds from my life and

615
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,920
cherished them because
in that moment it gave me hope.

01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,339
I'm probably not gonna see you for a bit but...

638
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:12,180
I hope that you're finding yourself, so...

639
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,840
Take care.

640
01:06:04,058 --> 01:06:06,880
Hey Alice it's Dahlia.

641
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:09,881
Hey...uhm...can you just tell Graham to call me back?

642
01:06:11,782 --> 01:06:14,682
Oh gotcha, okay.

643
01:06:15,183 --> 01:06:17,383
Yeah sorry, thanks, bye.

644
01:06:23,193 --> 01:06:26,971
[ALICE] Hey, are you good?
[GRAHAM] Yeah, I'm fine.

645
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,172
[ALICE] You know you can always talk to me, right?

646
01:06:32,273 --> 01:06:33,273
[GRAHAM] Yep.

647
01:06:34,474 --> 01:06:38,074
[ALICE] Ok. Well, I'm just across the hall.

648
01:06:46,475 --> 01:06:49,575
[DAHLIA] What are you fucking doing?
Why have you been ignoring me?

649
01:06:50,276 --> 01:06:52,076
[GRAHAM] I've been busy.
[DAHLIA] Busy with what?

650
01:06:52,077 --> 01:06:53,377
[GRAHAM] Stuff.

651
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,280
[DAHLIA] What are you not telling me Graham?

652
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,520
[GRAHAM] Nothing, I don't know what you're talking about.

653
01:06:58,521 --> 01:07:02,421
[DAHLIA] Don't be shit with me Graham.
You can't just throw me away after

654
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:05,622
we've been hanging out every single day
and there is nothing wrong.

655
01:07:05,823 --> 01:07:07,723
[GRAHAM] I don't see what the issue is

656
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:09,924
[DAHLIA] Then why did you tell Alice 
to tell me that

657 
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,225
you flew home this weekend to see your family?
 
657
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:16,459
[GRAHAM] Because I needed a fucking break, okay?
[DAHLIA] A break from what?

658
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:20,460
[GRAHAM] From you inside my head!
I feel like I'm going crazy

659
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,260
[DAHLIA] What am I getting in your head about?

660
01:07:22,261 --> 01:07:26,161
[GRAHAM] You know exactly what you're getting
in my head about this fucking gay shit

661
01:07:26,562 --> 01:07:29,862
You're asking so many questions.
I just need a moment to think.

662
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:32,963
[DAHLIA] I'm sorry that I've just been listening
to you and trying to give you advice.

663
01:07:32,964 --> 01:07:35,264
[GRAHAM] You know what? Your advice is shit

664
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,299
[DAHLIA] The fuck Graham
[GRAHAM] Just, just go Dahlia.

665
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,200
[DAHLIA] No, no I'm not going, why would I ?
I'm not gonna go!

666
01:07:45,301 --> 01:07:47,401
We've been hanging out every single day
I've been trying to help you

667
01:07:47,402 --> 01:07:50,902
[GRAHAM] I know, I know I'm just
trying to get a moment to myself,

668
01:07:50,903 --> 01:07:52,903
I'm trying to get away from everything.

669
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:59,879
[DAHLIA] But why? Haven't you just...
[GRAHAM] Because I'm scared, Dahlia, I'm scared.

670
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:07,439
For 21 years I've been living a lie and..and

671
01:08:07,779 --> 01:08:11,899
and I see myself changing into a different person
and I'm scared.

672
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,900
I've built up this barrier and
it makes me feel safe but

673
01:08:14,999 --> 01:08:17,939
I can feel myself dying from the inside out.

674
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:25,619
Do you know how difficult it is
telling people who you really are?

675
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:29,339
It shouldn't matter but it does.

676
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,939
And I appreciate you so much 
for helping me find myself,

677
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:42,560
but i can't fall asleep every night because
I  i know I'm not...I know i'm not normal.

678
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:47,420
[DAHLIA] But you aren't normal, Graham!
Who the fuck wants to be normal?

679
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:52,521
There's eight billion people on this wasteful,
fucking  planet but only one  of you.

680
01:08:53,619 --> 01:08:58,919
There's no other Graham with your smile
and your personality 

681
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:02,720
and...and your passion for life and the world.

682
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:09,499
Nobody gives the same love that you do.

683
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:15,200
You're so special and unique, 
you're so beautiful.

684
01:09:16,201 --> 01:09:18,201
[GRAHAM] Why don't I feel it then?

685
01:09:19,102 --> 01:09:22,002
I've been thinking all my questions are getting
answered but they aren't

686
01:09:22,203 --> 01:09:24,403
and, and, and I'm fucking tired of it.

687
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,839
[DAHLIA] Because you're a human,

688
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:31,640
you're learning how to love yourself unconditionally.

689
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:37,260
Your whole life people have told you who you are
and who you're supposed to love but

690
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:41,119
you're the only one who knows who you truly are.

691
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,899
I love you Graham and so does Alice and

692
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,200
Jess, and Cassie, and everybody

693
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:53,079
who's ever had the pleasure of meeting you.

694
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,180
I think I can speak for all of us

695
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:00,781
when I say that the Graham that we know is 

696
01:10:01,682 --> 01:10:06,082
an incredible, amazing, caring friend and

697
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,283
we're all so grateful for you and

698
01:10:10,884 --> 01:10:14,084
wish you nothing but the best and

699
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:17,339
we wish for nothing less of you

700
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,840
feeling comfortable in your own skin and

701
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,941
being the truest, the best version of yourself.

702
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,180
There's only one life,

703
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:34,881
why waste such a precious gift
by holding yourself back from it? 

704
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,240
[GRAHAM] His name is Connor. 

705
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:43,641
He was the person I was waiting for at the party.

706
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:49,740
I've liked, I've had feelings for other boys before,

707
01:10:50,141 --> 01:10:52,941
you know the ones I used to just brush away

708
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,740
but he was different.

709
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,040
He welcomed me and everything I was

710
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,640
or, at that moment, everything I wanted to be.

711
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:19,440
[DAKLIA] Do you still talk to him
[GRAHAM] His dad kicked him out.  

712
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:24,341
The night he told me was actually
the last time I saw him

713
01:11:24,942 --> 01:11:28,742
and that night we slept with each other.

714
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:33,339
I was terrified at first but

715
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,840
almost felt like the universe wrapped its arms
around me and told me it was gonna be okay.

716
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,500
For the first time I was able to like fully,

717
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:46,520
for the first time I was able to breathe.

718
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:53,460
I thought it was just a stupid one-night thing and

719
01:11:53,861 --> 01:11:57,161
my life would go right back on track
to being normal

720
01:11:58,362 --> 01:12:01,562
but...but now it all makes sense.

721
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:06,060
God all the time I've wasted.

722
01:12:07,461 --> 01:12:09,761
[DAHLIA] You didn't waste any time Graham.

723
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:15,559
I remember like it was just yesterday:
me and my little brother used to go out

724
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,360
to that lighthouse over there and

725
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:21,961
he used to think that
the little light on the top was a U.F.O.

726
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,819
and I used to pretend to be an alien

727
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:27,620
and chase him around until he got tired.

728
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,960
[GRAHAM] So...uhm...what's your brother doing now?  

729
01:12:35,261 --> 01:12:39,961
[DAHLIA] Uhm..He was five when
we first found out that he was sick.

730
01:12:41,562 --> 01:12:44,162
We just thought it was a virus and

731
01:12:46,063 --> 01:12:50,163
then a month later,
we were standing...standing in front of his grave.

732
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:56,420
[GRAHAM] I'm so sorry
[DAHLIA] It's okay, it's okay.

733
01:12:57,321 --> 01:13:00,821
It's just hard, you know, he'll never

734
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:07,280
be able to fall in love with a girl or a boy,
or even figure out which one.

735
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:12,081
He'll never experience his first heartbreak and 

736
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,140
be able to have a family and raise kids of his own,

737
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:26,940
but it helps me not take anything for granted

738
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:31,841
because you never know when

739
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,100
one day will be your last, so...

740
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:37,301
you can't take anything for granted.

741
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:44,840
Every second leading up to this point in our lives

742
01:13:45,141 --> 01:13:46,541
we were growing;

743
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:54,439
You were challenged not only by
the people in your life, but by yourself.

744
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,160
Every day, whether you notice it or not, 

745
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:01,961
you were loving yourself more and more

746
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,140
and eventually one day,

747
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:10,941
when you love yourself the way
that you deserve, you'll fly.

[GRAHAM] Hey.

788
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,820
[ALICE] Hey
[GRAHAM] Are you busy?

789
01:17:53,121 --> 01:17:56,921
[ALICE] Let me take a look at my very,
very busy schedule...

790
01:17:58,822 --> 01:18:01,122
No, what's going on?

791
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:03,980
[GRAHAM] You remember how I told you

792
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:07,481
to tell Dahlia that
I was going home this weekend?

793
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:13,140
[ALICE] Yeah, what happened with that?

794
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:19,141
[GRAHAM] Okay. I've just been thinking a lot,
going through some shit, you know

795
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:24,042
and...uhm...I don't like Grace
as much as i thought I did.

01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:28,219
[ALICE] Okay, have you told her that?

797
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:32,820

this afternoon...uhm...to talk to her.

01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,140

01:18:44,881 --> 01:18:50,281
Alice you you've been my best friend
since...for as long as i can remember.

802
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,879
You see me at my best and my worst and

803
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:58,359
I just, I never want to lose you.

804
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,860
[ALICE] Graham you're never going to lose me.

805
01:19:01,061 --> 01:19:07,361
[GRAHAM] I know, I know. It's just
I'm scared because of the person I am.

806
01:19:08,179 --> 01:19:09,319
[ALICE] Graham what's going on?

807
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:14,120
[GRAHAM] Alice...I'm, I'm...

808
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:17,239
I'm gay.

809
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:34,379
[ALICE] Graham you're my best friend,

810
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,480
I could never hate you,
especially not for something like this.

811
01:19:40,379 --> 01:19:42,179
It's who you are.

812
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:50,840
All I want is for you to be happy,
you deserve to be you. I love you. .

813
01:19:51,839 --> 01:19:57,639
[GRAHAM] I love you too, Alice.
[ALICE] Get off my room I'm gonna start crying.

814
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,719
[GRACE] Hey, thanks for picking me up.
[GRAHAM] Yeah of course.

815
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,220
[GRACE] What did you want to talk about?

816
01:20:20,221 --> 01:20:24,321
[GRAHAM] Uhm...So i'm gonna be straight up with you.

817
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:30,379
You're a wonderful person but
I can't do this anymore,  

818
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:35,080
and it's something I've been battling with
on the inside my whole life

819
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:38,059
and especially over the past couple of months.

820
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:46,380
I like men the way I'm supposed to like women.
[GRACE] Ohh 

821
01:20:46,781 --> 01:20:52,481
[GRAHAM] And I...I'm sorry for dragging you along
through all this. It's...it's been so much.

822
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:57,180
[GRACE] So the party meant nothing?
[GRAHAM] No, no, no. That was an incredible evening 

823
01:20:57,281 --> 01:20:58,781
That was. I just...

824
01:21:00,382 --> 01:21:02,482
You were kissing a different person...

825
01:21:02,879 --> 01:21:06,299
A lost person who's trying to find themselves.

826
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,200
[GRACE] As much as this hurts I'm proud of you.

827
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,480
[GRAHAM] What...?

828
01:21:14,981 --> 01:21:17,281
[GRACE] As much as anyone in my situation tries

829
01:21:17,282 --> 01:21:20,882
there's nothing we can do to change it,
you nor I can change it.

830
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:24,479
Falling in love is one of those things
that makes life worth it.

831
01:21:25,539 --> 01:21:27,659
Taking that away from somebody just because

832
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:31,460
the society tells them they're invalid, 
it's a waste.

833
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,460
A waste of a beautiful heart capable of doing so much.

834
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,940
Unfortunately, so many people live
their lives never fully as themselves.

835
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:45,060
They aren't happy, they marry the wrong person,
they live an unfulfilled life.

836
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:49,461
Graham I've only known you for a few months,
but from the moment I met you

837
01:21:49,462 --> 01:21:52,262
I knew i wanted you to live
an exceptionally happy life

838
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:55,463
and even though I can't help you in that way

839
01:21:55,464 --> 01:21:57,964
I really hope you keep me along for the ride.

[GRAHAM] Connor...
[CONNOR] Hey, Graham.

842
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:30,920
[DAHLIA] Uhm, Alice don't isn't there something
we should be doing?

843
01:22:31,621 --> 01:22:37,121
[ALICE] Yeah, uhm...taxes, it's tax season.

844
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:43,521
[GRAHAM] Do you wanna go for a walk?
[CONNOR] Sure.

845
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,540
[GRAHAM] So what are you doing back here?

846
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:54,641
[CONNOR] I'm just here for Jess

847
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,440
and my week of my work gave me a week off so...

848
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:03,541
I just took advantage of it rolled with it.

849
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,660
[GRAHAM] How long are you back for?

850
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,040
[CONNOR] Until Tomorrow.

851
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,840
I'm heading back soon so.

852
01:23:15,841 --> 01:23:18,341
[GRAHAM[ Well, how do you like the west coast?

853
01:23:20,342 --> 01:23:22,342
[CONNOR] So much better honestly.

854
01:23:24,943 --> 01:23:29,243
I found a job next to my apartment
so it's been pretty convenient, but...hum

855
01:23:31,444 --> 01:23:33,444
...it's a lot warmer than here.

856
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,780
How are things with you?

857
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:45,640
[GRAHAM] Pretty good actually, I mean...
I've been busy.

858
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:51,139
A lot of change I guess.

859
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,140
[CONNOR] It looks like your knee is getting a lot better too.

860
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:01,440
You seem a lot happier too.
[GRAHAM] Yeah,

861
01:24:04,059 --> 01:24:06,989
I finally started finding myself.

862
01:24:17,994 --> 01:24:21,200
[GRAHAM] You know I never thanked you, Dahlia.
[DAHLIA] Eh?

863
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:26,819
I never thanked you for helping me.
[DAHLIA] What did I help you with?

864
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,320
[GRAHAM] You cared for me, you guided me,

865
01:24:30,321 --> 01:24:33,821
you helped pull me out
of this messy place I am in my head

866
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:38,959
You taught me that it's okay to be who I am and

867
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,160
that i deserve to be happy,

868
01:24:41,761 --> 01:24:44,861
and for that, thank you.

869
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,600
[DAHLIA] I appreciate the gratitude but
I was only a small part.

870
01:24:52,701 --> 01:24:56,101
You had it in yourself the whole time. 

871
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:02,500
I just saw it but I was waiting
for you to find it for yourself.

872
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,740
I love you, Graham.

873
01:25:08,341 --> 01:25:12,641
You're a beautiful soul in a world that's now yours

874
01:25:21,419 --> 01:25:24,119
Love is such a powerful gift that we get to have.

875
01:25:25,499 --> 01:25:30,800
As people we deprive ourselves from this gift
so much that we end up living unhappy lives,

876
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,220
miserable with ourselves until
we're completely burnt out.

877
01:25:34,621 --> 01:25:37,321
Then it's too late.

878
01:25:39,299 --> 01:25:42,839
And for some of us we're still
trying to find out what love is.

879
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:50,079
Maybe love is about taking care of yourself:

880
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:55,480
your mind, your body, but especially, your heart.

881
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,740
Maybe love shows up when you realize that
the people who surround you

882
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:03,941
are full of love to give back.

883
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,800
Maybe love is about letting go of what destroys you

884
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:16,501
and learning that regret is just a black hole 
that nobody ever wants to encounter.

885
01:26:17,999 --> 01:26:20,939
Maybe love is realizing that you don't deserve to.

886
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:27,400
We're all put on this earth with the ability
to take this love

887
01:26:27,401 --> 01:26:29,401
and make it into anything we want.

888
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:37,440
At the end of the day, we're just people
with beautiful emotions,

889
01:26:37,241 --> 01:26:40,941
all just trying to make our hearts fly.
