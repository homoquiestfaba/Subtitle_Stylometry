(dramatic music)
(fire roaring)

3
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:36,079
(electricity crackling)

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,770
(wind whooshing)
(birds chirping)

00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:19,226
(footsteps shuffling)
(birds chirping)

00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:34,165
(hooves thundering)

00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:45,604
(footsteps thudding)

(hooves thundering)

11
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:11,799
(Gideon panting)
(footsteps thudding)

12
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,799
(hooves thundering)

(Gideon screaming)

15
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:38,258
(hooves thudding)

16
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:48,250
And God saw that the wickedness

17
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,780
of man was great in the earth.

18
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,280
And that every imagination

19
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,213
of the thoughts in his heart was only evil continually.

20
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:01,930
(blow thuds)
(Gideon groans)

21
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,720
And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth

22
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,830
and it grieved his heart.

23
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,460
(men laughing)

24
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,364
(blows thudding)
(Gideon groaning)

25
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,727
And the Lord said, "I will destroy a man

26
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,891
that I have created on the face of the earth.

27
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,397
For it repenteth me that I have made them."

28
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,293
Book of Genesis 6:5-7.

29
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:38,773
(horse whickering)
(men laughing)

30
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,873
That's enough.

31
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:45,941
(blows thudding)
(men laughing)

32
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,981
(gun firing)
(horse neighing)

33
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:49,814
I said, that's enough.

34
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:59,012
(wind whistling)

35
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,943
I apologize, Gideon.

36
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,890
If manners maketh man, I have surrounded myself with boys.

37
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:26,140
(Gideon groaning)

38
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,335
You look like you could use a drink.

39
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,300
(men laughing)

40
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,133
(Gideon groaning)

41
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:42,396
Hey.

42
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,937
Do you know who I am?

43
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:47,770
Uh-huh.

44
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,542
Then you know why I'm here.

45
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,813
(Gideon groaning)

46
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:00,640
(men laughing)

47
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,153
Your tears, they do you credit.

48
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,613
They show contrition.

49
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,630
And I have no doubt that God will forgive you

50
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,750
through the blood of his Son.

51
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,363
But I ain't God.

52
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,698
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

53
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,411
Ooh!
(men laughing)

54
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,490
Pick him up!

55
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,407
(Gideon screaming)

56
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:32,959
Hell, son. Live in it.

57
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:38,173
(Gideon screaming)

58
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,756

(fire crackling)
(Bess crying)

61
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,007
It's coming, sweet girl. It's coming.

62
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,513
Sh.

63
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,000
(wind whistling)

64
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,019
(Bess cooing)

65
00:07:15,872 --> 00:07:17,039
Rise and shine

66
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:30,738
(Bess cooing)

67
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:33,488

(Bess cooing)

73
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,813
Coffee.

74
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,260
Yep, yep, yep.

75
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:09,164
(Bess cooing)

76
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:11,782
Ready?

77
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,462
(door thudding)

78
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,458

82
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:05,974
(fire roaring)
(Bess crying)

83
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,913
What's going on. What wrong?

84
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:11,413
Hm, want your bed?

85
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:13,425
Be calm. Okay?

86
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,500
(water trickling)

87
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,130

(snake hissing)
(Bess crying)

89
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,028
Sh, sh.

90
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:46,341
(Bess screaming)

91
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,587
Sh, sh! It's okay.

92
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:58,185
It's all right. It's all right.

93
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:00,834
(Bess screaming)

94
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,584
(snake rattling)

95
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:12,199
Give me that.

96
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,290
(gun thudding)

97
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,530
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

98
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,060
Amen.
Amen.

99
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,920
You go hunt down that damn coyote,

100
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
before we lose any more of our chickens.

101
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,585
(wind whistling)

102
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:33,013
Uh, Pa?

103
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,220
Can I come hunt with you?

104
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,740
Ask your ma.

105
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,453
Well, can I?

106
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,413
Can I?

107
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,690
If you finish your chores.

108
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,435
Gotta clean my bed, feed Bess.

109
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:04,185
(wind whistling)

110
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,133
What's this?

111
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,783
Ma gave it to me.

112
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,350
She said you shot a red major clean off his horse

113
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,643
at 700 yards.

114
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,803
I think she said

115
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,123
I could shoot a red major off his horse 700 yards.

116
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,943
I can't.

117
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,723
Nobody can.

118
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,740
But you did kill kill Rebs.

119
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,773
It ain't polite conversation, son.

120
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,428
You were a sharp shooter?

121
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:41,140
(laughs) I'm still a sharp shooter, boy.

122
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,633
Don't you ever forget it. Goodnight.

123
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:52,170
(wind roaring)

124
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,053
Hattie McAllister, who would've thought?

125
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,740
Grilling pigtails, we used to eat candy

126
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,140
and read books in the back of your daddy's store

127
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,420
that someday we'd be homesteading this wild country

128
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,520
with the best of them.

129
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:26,222
Are we gonna make it out here?

130
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:27,783
Just gotta have a little grit.

131
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:31,033
I don't know where to find that anymore.

132
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:34,240
Sure you do.

133
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,073
I know.

134
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,337
Deep down, you're the toughest woman in this territory.

135
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:59,969
(wind roaring)

136
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:07,967
(door creaking)
(wind whistling)

137
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:11,988

(chickens clucking)
(cow mooing)

140
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:44,488
(wind whistling)
(door scraping)

141
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:55,550
(footsteps shuffling)

142
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:00,361

00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:24,503
(woman screaming)
(Bess screaming)

144
00:16:30,663 --> 00:16:34,913
(man speaking in foreign language)

145
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:42,301
(Bess screaming)
(woman screaming)

146
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:00,481
(woman screaming)

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:01,050
(horse neighing)
(wind whistling)

152
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:40,776
(knife scraping)

153
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:59,685
(drawer scraping)

154
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:16,123
Pa shot that coyote from half mile away.

155
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,680
Oh, it was more like 100 yards.

156
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,260
Good Lord, Hat. What the hell happened?

157
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,236
Ma?

158
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,080
(fire crackling)

159
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,983
Boy's down. Supper's put away.

160
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,450
I'm sorry.

161
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,283
They must have wandered

162
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,420
off the reservation looking for something.

163
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,353
Got no scrap.

164
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:14,783
I want to go home.

165
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:16,963
All right, if you wanna see your folks,

166
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,500
reckon I can get a work with the railroad.

167
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,373
Buy you a ticket.

168
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:23,501
I don't want a ticket.

169
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,490
I want to pack the wagon and take our children out

170
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,603
of this God forsaken place.

171
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,720
I know it's been hard, but this here's good land.

172
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,163
We live in a shack, Jeb.

173
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,510
We've got old tools, worn out live stock,

174
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,560
and can only feed our children

175
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,360
with food borrowed off store credit.

176
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,833
I understand it's been tough.

177
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,690
But this is our dream, Hattie.

178
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,760
This is what we set out to do,

179
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,810
build a home on land we can call our own.

180
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,430
I want you to ask my daddy for a job.

181
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,290
You want us to crawl back to him?

182
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,970
We can't make it on our own.

183
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,420
Hell, yes, we can. We just gotta keep on going.

184
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:12,850
Well, I can't.

185
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:17,133
(fire crackling)

186
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:26,242
(wind roaring)

187
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:27,909
That's good.

188
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,460
I'm gonna ahead into town, grab supplies.

189
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,293
Be a strong boy.

190
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:40,417
Look after your mom while I'm in town, won't ya?

191
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:45,105
(wind roaring)

192
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:50,963
(horse whickering)

193
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:53,905
(horse neighing)

194
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:54,822
Here, Pa.

195
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:58,836
(wind roaring)

196
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,892
(Jeb whistling)
(horse whickering)

197
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,642
(wagon rattling)

198
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:20,910
Jeb.
Hiyah, go! (whistles)

199
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,910
(wind whooshing)
(wagon rattling)

200
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:41,036
(birds chirping)

201
00:22:44,214 --> 00:22:46,797
(hay rustling)

202
00:22:48,214 --> 00:22:51,131
(horse whickering)

203
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,760
I think we've earned it.

204
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,443
Pa says candy's a real treat,

205
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,563
just for Christmas and funerals.

206
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,310
When I was a girl in St. Louis,

207
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,723
we'd have candy every week.

208
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,940
Really?

209
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,800
We'd have ice cream in the summer,

210
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,060
toffee in the fall and peppermint sticks at Christmas.

211
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,660
You would've loved living there.

212
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,360
Is it true that Granny and Gramps didn't want you

213
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,233
to marry Pa?

214
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,960
They just had their own ideas

215
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,030
about what they wanted for me.

216
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,230
But PA's a hero. He defended Missouri from the Rebs.

217
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,557
Your pa was a Reb.

218
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,900
He used it to be join up to save the Union.

219
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,030
Things weren't simple back then.

220
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,973
Will.

221
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,247
(birds chirping)

222
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:58,605
(hooves thundering)

223
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,670
I might fine morning to you, ma'am.

224
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,320
And to you.

225
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,403
I wonder if we might trouble you for some of your water.

226
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,020
Our mounts are about dried out and we're not much better.

227
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,370
Take as much as you like.

228
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,773
Much obliged.

229
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,433
(chain rattling)

230
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,823
Will.

231
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:59,590
(blow thudding)
(men laughing)

232
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,810
What's the matter with you, son.

233
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,660
Didn't your ma teach you any manners?

234
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,140
You didn't have no ma, dropped out of a whore

235
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,672
and raised by those fur traders, is what I heard.

236
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:12,923
(men laughing)

237
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:14,473
I do apologize, ma'am.

238
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,800
We have been in the saddle for about three months now

239
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,560
and I'm afraid it is beginning to show.

240
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,160
Um, I couldn't help, but notice your coop over yonder,

241
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,250
I, I wonder if I might offer to buy some salt pork

242
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,410
and maybe a dozen eggs.

243
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,810
Fetch as many as you need.

244
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,785
Well.

245
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,830
I must confess,

246
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,023
I, I do feel a bit forward talking business with a lady.

247
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:43,753
Uh, is your husband at home?

248
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,983
He ain't here. He gone to town.

249
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,910
Oh, well then I guess that makes you the man

250
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,060
of the house, I reckon.

251
00:25:57,548 --> 00:26:00,298
(horse neighing)

252
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,520
(men laughing)

253
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,503
Oh, uh, one more thing.

254
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,430
Is that a Missouri accent that I detect.

255
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,690
St. Louis.

256
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,140
I knew it. What a happy coincidence.

257
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,770
I am a Cameron man, myself, that big fella over there,

258
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,418
he's from Arkansas, but we try not to hold that against it.

259
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,380
(men laughing)

260
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,140
We don't get many Missourians out this way.

261
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,793
No, ma'am, I expect you don't.

262
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:38,752
(horse whickering)

263
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:45,084
I'd be happy to cook you men some breakfast before you go.

264
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,483
Well, we would be much obliged.

265
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,580
This is very kind of you, ma'am.

266
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:08,017
(footsteps tapping)

267
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,990
Those your folks over there, Mrs. Uh?

268
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,520
McAllister.
McAllister.

269
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,493
Hattie. This is Bess and this is Will.

270
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,353
Set the table.

271
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,750
How old are you?

272
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,850
Nine and three quarters.

273
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,453
Why then, I reckon that's big enough to wear one of these.

274
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:39,349
(men laughing)

275
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,140
This is a lovely home you have here, Mrs. McAllister.

276
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,643
Your husband is a lucky man.

277
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,059

278
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:56,050
(Bess crying)

279
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,600
She wants to talk. (laughs)

280
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,463
Oh, now here, allow me.

281
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,830
I've held a baby at two in my life.

282
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:07,570
Yeah. You okay?

283
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,403
Yeah.

308
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:21,880

You never heard that song before.

00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,763
You ain' got a problem with Rebs, now do you, boy.

321
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,450
Our young host was born after hostilities ended.

322
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,243
I'm sure he's a proud American, aren't you, boy.

323
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,790
Nothing wrong with that,

324
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,700
man should be loyal to his own country.

325
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,693
Not everybody is.

326
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,860
My daddy was a sharp shooter.

327
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,733
Was he now?

328
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,750
Will's not a bad shot himself.

329
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,130
Why don't you go show these gentlemen

330
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,080
that shotgun your daddy got you.

331
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,900

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

332
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,183
Let me see that.

333
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:14,457
Oh my goodness.

334
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,317
Those Rebs best be careful coming around here.

335
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:26,317
Oh.
(men laughing)

336
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,460
Will, warm up the coffee.

337
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,600
Hope you like strawberry jam.

338
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
That's all we could grow this spring.

339
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,383
Oh, I'm sure we like it just fine.

340
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,353
Before we dig in, boys, we like to have a little prayer.

341
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,633
Keep us humble.

342
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,563
Lord,

343
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,610
please look down on us and help us to be grateful

344
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,070
for these gifts that we have been given

345
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,890
and help us to be always mindful

346
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,120
of the needs of others and not think only of ourselves.

347
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,480
We pray in the name of your son, Jesus Christ.

348
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,610
Amen.
Amen.

349
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,551
All right.

350
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:22,812

Ma!

351
00:32:22,812 --> 00:32:25,330
(Bess cooing)

352
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,563
Will, get behind the stove with your sister. Now!

353
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:34,733
(Bess crying)

354
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,023
There must be some misunderstanding, ma'am.

355
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,153
How have we offended?

356
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,733
I don't feed killers in my house.

357
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,713
Killers.

358
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,434
Good Lord. (laughs)

359
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,250
Oh, oh, I see the confusion.

360
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,770
Boy, she is talking about those trophies

361
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,803
that we got off that Cheyenne trader near Fort Laramie.

362
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,790
Ma'am, I realize that's an unseemly business,

363
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,770
but those can be very valuable objects

364
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,260
when you're trading in the back country.

365
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,780
Now can't we just sit back down

366
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,930
and talk about something more pleasant.

367
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,613
We were having such a nice time.

368
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,423
I think it's best you go now.

369
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,130
What the hell are we waiting for?

370
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,993
She's only got two rounds.

371
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,540
As you wish.

372
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,033
And leave your guns.

373
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,210
The hell we will.

374
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,090
Ma'am, I'm sure you understand

375
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,803
how valuable these weapons are.

376
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,583
You can trade your scalps for some new ones.

377
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,840
You heard the woman.

378
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,720
Uh-uh, these were my pa's.

379
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,973
They took him off his dead body of Pea Ridge.

380
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,213
Fine.

381
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,353
Can I have my hat?

382
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,100
Will, give him his hat.

383
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:28,229
(horse neighing)

384
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:31,893
Hiyah!

385
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,036
(door creaking)

386
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,303
(cabinet thudding)

387
00:36:06,303 --> 00:36:07,136
Help me.

388
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:13,159
(Bess crying)
(both groaning)

389
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:17,385
Push! Push!

390
00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:24,447
(Bess screaming)

391
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:30,628
(glass crashing)
(Hattie panting)

392
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,902
(wind whooshing)

393
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:48,895
(Hattie panting)
(guns clicking)

394
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:51,517
(glass crashing)

395
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:52,885
(guns firing)

396
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:56,104
Son of a bitch!
(Bess screaming)

397
00:36:56,104 --> 00:36:56,937
(gun firing)
(Hattie groaning)

398
00:36:56,937 --> 00:36:58,020
Ah, get down!

399
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,905
(horse neighing)
(gun firing)

400
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:07,848
Wait a sec! Come and see!

401
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:09,456
(gun firing)
(glass crashing)

402
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:12,976
Come and see! (groaning)

403
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:17,976
Son of a bitch!
(gun firing)

404
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:26,058
(Bess screaming)
(Hattie panting)

405
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:29,213
(hooves thudding)

406
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:33,972
(gun clicking)
(Bess crying)

407
00:37:33,972 --> 00:37:38,972
(gun firing)

408
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:46,548
(Hattie panting)
(Bess screaming)

409
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:50,638
(wind whistling)
(Bess crying)

410
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:53,388
(horse neighing)

411
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:56,792
(guns firing)

412
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:08,195
(gun firing)
(glass crashing)

413
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,900
(horse neighing)

414
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:21,248
Hyah! What the hell are you doing?

415
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:22,665
I want 'em alive!

416
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,703
Whoo! She can't shoot for jack shit.

417
00:38:31,998 --> 00:38:34,344
(men panting)
(Bess crying)

418
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,506
I need you to be brave. Okay?

419
00:38:36,506 --> 00:38:37,339
Okay.

420
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,093
Reload.

421
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,370
Take care of your sister.

422
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:49,621
(Bess crying)

423
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,873
(Long Hair panting)

424
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,942
(bullets clicking)

425
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:58,924
(door thudding)

426
00:38:58,924 --> 00:39:02,465
(Hattie panting)

427
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,811
(door thudding)

428
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,228
(gun firing)

429
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,060
(Hattie panting)

430
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:23,756
(horse neighing)

431
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:39,503
(horse neighing)
(Long Hair panting)

432
00:39:42,244 --> 00:39:44,994
(Hattie panting)

433
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:03,054
(Hattie panting)

434
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:08,254
(horse whickering)

435
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,279
(Bess cooing)

436
00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:33,343
(gun firing)
(Long Hair groaning)

437
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,843
(Bess crying)

438
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:42,267
(footsteps shuffling)
(Long Hair groaning)

439
00:40:44,936 --> 00:40:47,686
(Hattie gasping)

440
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,513
Just take what you want and go.

441
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:56,847
(gun clicking)

442
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,032
(hooves thudding)

443
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:24,443
(laughs) But what we want is you.

444
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,056
(crickets chirping)

445
00:41:37,403 --> 00:41:39,010
I can do anything.

446
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,403
Lay track, shoot buffalo, run the teams.

447
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,000
I appreciate the interest, Mr. McAllister.

448
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,920
There simply isn't the work.

449
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,440
We have more than enough men to meet our needs.

450
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,820
There has to be something.

451
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,010
I could even help with the chuck wagons.

452
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,350
Oh Lord, we're not cowboys.

453
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,600
We just bring our food up from down the line.

454
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,110
Good day. Best of luck.

455
00:42:09,763 --> 00:42:12,346
(gentle music)

456
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:27,856
(Bess crying)

457
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:31,106
You're all right. It's okay.

458
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:33,554
Here we go.

459
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:36,641
Okay. Okay.

460
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:43,011
Mrs. McAllister.

461
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:48,011
(gun clicking)
(Bess crying)

462
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:55,138
Hide your sister.

463
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,124
(gun clicking)

464
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,783
Mrs. McAllister.
That's far enough.

465
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,220
I regret that we got off on the wrong foot.

466
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,443
I would like for us to start over, make it right.

467
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,970
There's nothing to talk about,

468
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,883
except you men getting on your horses and riding off.

469
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:42,343
I respect how you must be feeling and I can sympathize,

470
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,433
but this standoff not doing anybody a lick of good.

471
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,730
It's true that I've done my share of killing

472
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,413
both during the war and after.

473
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,743
But one thing I ain't never done,

474
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,373
I ain't never hurt a woman or a child.

475
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,280
Why should I believe a word you say.

476
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,683
I had a daughter once.

477
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,473
She was my only child, apple of my eye.

478
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,870
Every bit of love and affection a father can give

479
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,493
I lavished on that child.

480
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,373
She's dead now.

481
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,213
Buried out Cameron way.

482
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:44,779
(wind whistling)

483
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,753
I swear on her grave,

484
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,830
I will not harm a hair on your head

485
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,480
or on the heads of your children.

486
00:44:58,048 --> 00:45:00,715
(guns clicking)

487
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:04,923
Dammit!

488
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:08,441
(guns firing)

489
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,183
Damn fools!

490
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:21,488
(gun clicking)
(Gold Tooth panting)

491
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:23,790
(Bess crying)

492
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,540
You okay? You okay?

493
00:45:30,651 --> 00:45:33,068
(gun firing)

494
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:40,249
(gun clicking)
(Hattie panting)

495
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:50,039
(fire crackling)

496
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:52,810
(Bess crying)

497
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,006
I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't mean to wake her.

498
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,533
That's all right.

499
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:58,853
Bring her here.

500
00:45:58,853 --> 00:46:01,353
(Bess crying)

501
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:18,065
(door scraping)

502
00:46:21,356 --> 00:46:23,773
(cow mooing)

503
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,937
Come on, Bess.

504
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:39,703
What are they doing with Daisy?

505
00:46:42,942 --> 00:46:45,525
(gun clicking)

506
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:48,723
No.

507
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:51,305
(gun firing)

508
00:46:51,305 --> 00:46:52,138
No!

509
00:46:54,804 --> 00:46:56,103
No.

510
00:46:56,103 --> 00:47:01,103
(men laughing)
(Bess screaming)

511
00:47:09,255 --> 00:47:14,255
(knife scraping)
(blood squirting)

512
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:25,313
Sorry.
(Long Hair groaning)

513
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:32,801
Now, you hold him.

514
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:36,015
Oh, hell, Captain, it'll heal itself.

515
00:47:36,015 --> 00:47:37,951
It'll heal on its own, Captain.

516
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:40,060
It'll heal on its own.

517
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,606
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, no.

518
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:45,784
Please refrain from that papist blasphemy.

519
00:47:45,784 --> 00:47:47,009
Open his sleeve.

520
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:51,709
Damn them all to hell! (sobbing)

521
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:55,585
Well I reckon that all the sufferings of this present age

522
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:57,513
are not worthy compared to the glory,

523
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:01,881
which shall be revealed in us.

524
00:48:06,571 --> 00:48:09,106
It's gonna be all right.

525
00:48:09,106 --> 00:48:13,330
Pa couldn't have been Reb, Ma, just couldn't have been.

526
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,980
That's what you're upset about?

527
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:20,833
(sighs) Your Pa's no Rebel.

528
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,380
He may have begun fighting for the South,

529
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,233
but he ended that war a patriot.

530
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,785
But you said that he was-

531
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:32,985
Good and bad aren't always so clear, Will.

532
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,077
Sometimes you wake up

533
00:48:35,077 --> 00:48:38,080
and you realize you're on the wrong side of things.

534
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,080
And when you pa did,

535
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,160
he have the courage to make things right.

536
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,543
Just like he always does.

537
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,573
And when he comes back,

538
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,653
those killers outside are gonna feel God's wrath.

539
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,903
What if they kill him instead?

540
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,758
(Hattie sighs)

541
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:25,097
(fire crackling)

542
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,253
Better eat up, son.

543
00:49:32,413 --> 00:49:34,693
Hard to be brave on an empty belly.

544
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,153
Well, Captain, there's,

545
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,440
there's just something about all this

546
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,053
that I don't rightly understand.

547
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,273
Go on.

548
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,233
Well, it's all you said about not hurting women or kids.

549
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,190
And you think we ought to stand by that.

550
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,320
You remember when your Pappy and I rode out

551
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,890
to defend our way of life from the tyrant Lincoln.

552
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,723
I do.

553
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,730
We had a lot of fine ideas then

554
00:50:27,134 --> 00:50:29,890
about chivalry and honor

555
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:33,373
and what war should look like.

556
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:39,523
How the rightness of our cause would carry us to victory.

557
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,823
And the Yankees stole our cattle.

558
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,360
They burned our farms

559
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:56,173
and hung our kin without cause.

560
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:00,500
And all our fine notions were nothing

561
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:06,510
in the face of their rapacious, murderous hatred.

562
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,863
They took my only child from me,

563
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,990
ripped her from this life

564
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,423
without mercy or pity.

565
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,950
And there ain't no law on earth

566
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,490
or in heaven or hell

567
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:47,743
that can keep a father from taking his revenge.

568
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:52,190
Not the devil

569
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:59,803
and not God himself.

570
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:11,610
That make things any clearer?

571
00:52:13,604 --> 00:52:16,354
(fire crackling)

572
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,740
Hell, we ain't gonna have to hurt anybody anyway.

573
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,003
How you figure that?

574
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:34,033
Mrs. McAllister ain't cut out for this kinda life.

575
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,053
I can tell that by looking in her eyes.

576
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,413
We give her enough time,

577
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,533
she's just gonna come on out here to us.

578
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,603
That's the sensible thing to do.

579
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,604
And she is a sensible woman.

580
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,093
Captain!
What?

581
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,037
The hell.

582
00:53:00,586 --> 00:53:02,419
Damnation!

583
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:08,866
(Bess crying)
(fire roaring)

584
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:17,957
(ax thudding)
(Bess crying)

585
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:28,155
They'll see that for miles.

586
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:31,716
(gun clicking)

587
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:36,700
Ma!

588
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,253
Keep it burning, you understand?

589
00:53:38,253 --> 00:53:39,772
Anything you can find.

590
00:53:39,772 --> 00:53:42,977
(Bess screaming)
(Hattie panting)

591
00:53:42,977 --> 00:53:46,186
(gun firing)

592
00:53:46,186 --> 00:53:48,593
(door scraping)

593
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:53,593
(fire roaring)
(Bess screaming)

594
00:53:55,054 --> 00:54:00,054
(Hattie panting)
(door scraping)

595
00:54:01,728 --> 00:54:03,527
(gun clicking)

596
00:54:03,527 --> 00:54:05,991
(gun firing)

597
00:54:05,991 --> 00:54:10,657
(glass crashing)
(Hattie groaning)

598
00:54:10,657 --> 00:54:13,324
(door creaking)

599
00:54:15,978 --> 00:54:20,978
(Bess crying)
(fire roaring)

600
00:54:26,146 --> 00:54:28,563
(gun firing)

601
00:54:33,678 --> 00:54:36,201
(men panting)
(Bess crying)

602
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:37,034
Look.

603
00:54:39,772 --> 00:54:42,439
(both coughing)

604
00:54:51,694 --> 00:54:55,170
(fire crackling)
(Bess crying)

605
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,753
(Hattie and Will coughing)

606
00:55:10,712 --> 00:55:13,462
(Bess screaming)

607
00:55:15,213 --> 00:55:20,213
Will, your sister. (coughing)

608
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:34,550
(men panting)

609
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:37,217
(guns clicking)

610
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,942
(hooves thundering)

611
00:55:57,926 --> 00:56:01,009
(horse whickering)

612
00:56:01,009 --> 00:56:02,426
Come to a help.

613
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,080
The children are still inside?

614
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,780
You come alone, neighbor?

615
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,620
Yeah, I see the smoke, I come riding real fast.

616
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,943
Why? What's wrong.

617
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,240
Mr. Sameson, no, go get help.

618
00:56:23,139 --> 00:56:24,577
Get help!

619
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:26,290
No. I want him alive.

620
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,893
Ride, Mr. Sameson, ride!

621
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:38,131
(fire roaring)

622
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:40,964
(hooves thudding)

623
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:07,954
(Bess crying)
(Hattie coughing)

624
00:57:07,954 --> 00:57:10,704
(fire crackling)

625
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:17,137
Let it burn!

626
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:19,593
Are you crazy? Captain wants them alive.

627
00:57:21,988 --> 00:57:24,738
(glass crashing)

628
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:34,201
Just trying to help.

629
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,951
(Bess screaming)

630
00:57:40,112 --> 00:57:42,945
(water splashing)

631
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:56,634
(lasso whooshing)
(hooves thudding)

632
00:57:57,158 --> 00:58:00,672
(Mr. Sameson groaning)
(body thudding)

633
00:58:00,672 --> 00:58:05,672
(horse whickering)
(birds squawking)

634
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,778
(Mr. Sameson groaning)

635
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:23,708
(wind whooshing)
(birds chirping)

636
00:58:34,036 --> 00:58:36,619
(fire roaring)

637
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:54,730
Let him go.

638
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,170
Mrs. McAllister, I'm surprised.

639
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,653
It does not dignify a woman to holler and carry on such.

640
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,530
He hasn't done anything to you.

641
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,669
Well, that is entirely true.

642
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,730
But as you see,

643
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,873
your obstinance has put us all in a difficult situation.

644
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:22,660
So I'm gonna ask you again to come out here

645
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,513
and let us resolve this like civilized people.

646
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,493
Hattie, you stay there.

647
00:59:29,493 --> 00:59:31,270
He's a no good liar.

648
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,270
He can't be trusted.

649
00:59:33,872 --> 00:59:36,022
Of course, you'd rather not be civilized.

650
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,053
I'll have to resort to other methods.

651
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,280
You don't have to do this.

652
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,273
I'd hope not to. See, I'm a preacher's son.

653
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,780
I was raised to believe in the Good Book.

654
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,843
It's the only thing that keeps us from being savages.

655
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,220
But even a preacher's boy has got his limits.

656
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,373
Please. He has a wife and five children.

657
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,240
The Lord is my shepherd.

658
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,203
I shall not want.

659
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,360
You made me to lay down.

660
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,250
I don't like repeating myself.

661
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,083
He led me besides the still waters.

662
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:17,050
Mrs. McAllister, so I'm gonna say this

663
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,223
one more time.

664
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,220
Come on out!

665
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,220
In the valley of the shadow off death,

666
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,190
I will fear no evil.

667
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,218
No. No.

668
01:00:26,218 --> 01:00:28,008
For thou art with me.

669
01:00:28,008 --> 01:00:32,668
(Hattie screaming)
(blood spurting)

670
01:00:32,668 --> 01:00:35,251
(men cackling)

671
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:44,188
(Bess screaming)

672
01:00:45,856 --> 01:00:48,856
(crickets chirping)

673
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:56,321
(table crashing)
(Bess crying)

674
01:01:05,049 --> 01:01:07,799
(fabric tearing)

675
01:01:20,194 --> 01:01:22,777
(fire roaring)

676
01:01:29,515 --> 01:01:32,432
(torch clattering)

677
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:42,998
(fire roaring)
(Hattie panting)

678
01:01:44,959 --> 01:01:47,542
(upbeat music)

679
01:02:27,445 --> 01:02:31,810
(horse whickering)
(upbeat music)

680
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,733
You left it across the street.

681
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,773
See?

682
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,360
Maybe I best come down and escort you across.

683
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,337
No, miss, I'm quite all right.

684
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,943
Hey. You really gonna drive home half liquored up?

685
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:58,060
Seems to me you ought to sober up

686
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,793
or just go on, get drunk all the way.

687
01:03:03,434 --> 01:03:04,757
I gotta get home to my farm.

688
01:03:04,757 --> 01:03:07,963
Farm? Your farm ain't gonna miss you.

689
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,170
We got real nice beds in there.

690
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,930
Soft satin sheets.

691
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:15,520
Oh, you could sleep all night.

692
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,270
Wake up first thing in the morning.

693
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,410
Of course, you can do other things too.

694
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:23,044
My wife.

695
01:03:23,044 --> 01:03:24,483
Your wife?
She's waiting on me.

696
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,990
(scoffs) Something tells me your wife,

697
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,583
she don't appreciate you,

698
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:37,980
hard workin' man like you, not the way you deserve.

699
01:03:39,997 --> 01:03:43,164
(body thuds)
Oh, geez!

700
01:03:47,149 --> 01:03:52,149
(upbeat music)
(people chattering)

701
01:03:59,745 --> 01:04:02,006
(horse neighing)

702
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:03,089
Hyah!

703
01:04:07,248 --> 01:04:08,081
(Bess cooing)

704
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:10,863
I think it's time you learned how to make some coffee.

705
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:13,440
First, put on some water.

706
01:04:20,586 --> 01:04:23,086
(Bess cooing)

707
01:04:30,444 --> 01:04:33,277
(water trickling)

708
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,613
Now we need to grind up some beans.

709
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,973
You want 'em fine like table salt.

710
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,750
Can we boil 'em?

711
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,010
That may be how cow hands

712
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,630
make some black sludge they call coffee,

713
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,190
but it's not the proper way.

714
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,840
Well, what do we do different?

715
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,190
How's that grind looking?

716
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:02,793
(coffee grinder whirring)

717
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,980
Just like salt.

718
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,150
Good.

719
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,250
Now find something we can use as a filter.

720
01:05:17,463 --> 01:05:19,963
(Bess cooing)

721
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,210
Now we wait for it to boil.

722
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,160
You wanna know how your pa and I met?

723
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:50,980
I was walking home from school one day back in St. Louis.

724
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,020
It was during the war and the streets were full of soldiers.

725
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,060
One bunch decided they wanted to have some fun.

726
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,870
So they stole my books. (laughs)

727
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,000
I begged and pleaded for them to give 'em back.

728
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,900
But they wouldn't.

729
01:06:06,848 --> 01:06:09,040
And just when I started to cry,

730
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,113
I heard someone order those boys to stop.

731
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:15,340
I turned around expecting a lieutenant or a captain,

732
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,723
but it was just your pa.

733
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,443
He was all alone,

734
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,323
in a private's uniform no less.

735
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,310
There was one man against six,

736
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:31,300
but there was something in his voice,

737
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,770
something that said he could still lick

738
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,193
every single one of them, one at a time or all together.

739
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:40,270
When they heard it, one by one,

740
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,410
they started to drift away

741
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,713
till the last one, gave me back my books and apologized.

742
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,940
Your pa asked me if he could walk me home.

743
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,333
I said, yes, but in my heart, I already knew.

744
01:06:57,936 --> 01:06:58,769
Knew what?

745
01:07:03,308 --> 01:07:06,641
That he was the man I wanted to marry.

746
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,020
That nothing in this world could ever cause him to give up

747
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,443
and whatever would come, he would stand up and protect me.

748
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:24,553
All right, now pour it over the beans, nice and slow.

749
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:47,470
How about some more rock candy?

750
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,420
Can't trick your coffee black, can you?

751
01:08:01,163 --> 01:08:06,163
(thunder rumbling)
(crickets chirping)

752
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:11,296
Will. Will!

753
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,150
I need you to keep watch.

754
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,440
I'll be right back.

755
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,783
Psst, psst!

756
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:38,943
Ma!

757
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,483
Don't shoot.

758
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:46,213
I just come the talk.

759
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,250
You so much as flinch

760
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,473
and I swear, I'll put a bullet through your heart.

761
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:54,403
I ain't armed.

762
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,270
Right through your heart.

763
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,103
Please.

764
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,043
The others don't know I come.

765
01:09:04,043 --> 01:09:05,093
Will you just listen?

766
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,960
All right. Talk then.

767
01:09:11,222 --> 01:09:13,600
This ain't what I thought I was joining.

768
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,420
We was supposed to rob banks and trains,

769
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,253
not hurt women and children.

770
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,770
It just don't sit right with me no more.

771
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:26,320
You stood by why I killed my neighbor.

772
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,510
If I'd done said anything,

773
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:30,310
I'd be lying dead on the ground too.

774
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:35,080
I remember my mama once warned me

775
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,063
about falling in with bad company.

776
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,930
Once I did, I didn't realize

777
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,643
how hard it would be to part ways.

778
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:45,943
Who are they?

779
01:09:47,411 --> 01:09:48,961
They're a gang from Missouri.

780
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,840
They rode with Quantrill's Raiders during the war.

781
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,673
Captain was his right hand man.

782
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:00,400
Most of the fellers gave up when old Quantrill was killed

783
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,540
or after the surrender.

784
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,683
But not Captain.

785
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,293
The war ain't never ended for him.

786
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:12,643
Look, if if'n I help you,

787
01:10:14,094 --> 01:10:16,833
will you put in a good world with the US Marshall for me?

788
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:21,793
Right then, here's my plan.

789
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:26,230
The others are sleeping and I'm supposed to be on watch.

790
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:29,020
If you and the young ones can get out of the window,

791
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,540
I'll meet you back about a hundred paces.

792
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,533
I'll bring horses.

793
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,740
You can get 'em without waking them.

794
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,740
I already done got 'em all saddled up.

795
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:45,100
(crickets chirping)

796
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,600
I'll get the children ready.

797
01:10:47,796 --> 01:10:49,233
We'll meet you in 10 minutes.

798
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:53,569
All right.

799
01:10:53,569 --> 01:10:54,457
Thank you.

800
01:10:54,457 --> 01:10:57,920
And we can ride on out afore anyone's wiser

801
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,133
and then go find Jeb.

802
01:11:01,475 --> 01:11:04,551
(gun firing)
(glass crashing)

803
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,479
(Bess crying)

804
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:09,312
Jed! Son of a bitch!

805
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:12,733
She got him, Captain.

806
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,543
Now I gotta tell his mama!

807
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,650
That dang fool kid couldn't lie for shit!

808
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,030
You mind your tongue.

809
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:24,343
Ma, he was just trying to help!

810
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,143
I never told him your pa's name, not one time.

811
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,830
Then how did they know it?

812
01:11:36,272 --> 01:11:37,540
They're not after us.

813
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,040
They came looking for your pa.

814
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:45,190
That's why they're out there taking their time.

815
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:47,440
That's why they're out there now waiting.

816
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,440
We're just the bait.

817
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,483
Your father's walking into a trap.

818
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:56,933
Will, I'm gonna need you to do something.

819
01:11:56,933 --> 01:11:58,773
And you're gonna have to be brave to do it.

820
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,250
I need you to get the filly.

821
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,863
What? No, I can't.

822
01:12:07,863 --> 01:12:09,417
Yes, you can.

823
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:11,113
You're your father's son.

824
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,083
It's our turn to protect him.

825
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:31,866
(crickets chirping)

826
01:12:38,712 --> 01:12:41,379

01:14:03,826 --> 01:14:04,659

(Bess cooing)

840
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:10,980
It's okay. It's okay.

841
01:14:13,568 --> 01:14:16,297

842
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:18,855

Hell, Captain,

851
01:15:03,034 --> 01:15:06,565
the horses are running to kingdom come!

852
01:15:06,565 --> 01:15:09,189
You get her!

853
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:10,780
(wind whistling)

854
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,653
Oh, come on.

Will! Will!

858
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,130
Think you're going.

859
01:15:32,717 --> 01:15:36,013
You know, Captain, he didn't mean you no harm before,

860
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,323
but he does now.

861

No! No!
(Bess screaming)

867
01:16:00,476 --> 01:16:03,771
You don't move. You understand me?

868
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:05,021
Don't you move!

869
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,357
Oh my god, my god, she got my face!

870
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:11,816
Will, run!

Get out of there! Let go!

That was a damn fool thing you done back there.

899
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,063
Almost got yourself killed.

900
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:21,040
I told you, I ain't never harmed a woman.

901
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,080
Captain, when we gonna go get that little Yankee bastard?

902
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,940
Shut your mouth.

903
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,790
We got everything we need right here.

904
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,970
All we gotta do is get Mrs. McAllister back home

905
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:32,925
before she catches her death out here.

906
01:19:32,925 --> 01:19:34,120
Yeah, but you told me I could get him

907
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,350
and bring him back here and cut his-

908
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:38,000

01:20:05,192 --> 01:20:08,359
(Gold Tooth groaning)

913
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,070
You want to see how it feels to get your flesh burned off?

914
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:19,393
Gentle does it, boys.

915
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:29,320
As it says in Ecclesiastes:

916
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,210
Cast thy bread upon the waters

917
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,883
for thou shalt find it after many days.

918
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:38,826
(hooves thudding)

919
01:20:48,221 --> 01:20:51,388
(Gold Tooth groaning)

920
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:55,520
Jeb!

921
01:20:57,883 --> 01:20:58,843
Care to die?

922
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,940
This ain't no way to start a conversation.

923
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:10,753
Let her go, Miller.

924
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:13,843
It's Captain Miller to you.

925
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,300
I'd appreciate it if you'd remember that.

926
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:24,490
Where are my children?

927
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,310
They're safe.

928
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:28,810
They made it across the river.

929
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,720
You still call yourself a Confederate officer.

930
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,930
You got no right to hold a woman prisoner.

931
01:21:40,007 --> 01:21:42,580
"For a man shall leave his father and mother

932
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,050
and cleave unto his wife.

933
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:46,150
And they shall be as one flesh."

934
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:49,060
Genesis chapter two, 24th verse.

935
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:52,150
Your sins have found you out, Jebediah McAllister,

936
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:54,613
and now they are visited upon your whole family.

937
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:59,984
(birds squawking)

938
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,590
What do you want?

939
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:11,410
Vengeance.

940
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:13,660
Vengeance belongs to the Lord, Miller.

941
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,853
Well, the Lord takes too damn long.

942
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:21,250
Now I can see that I am being less than clear.

943
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,513
So let me be blunt.

944
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:26,980
You either put that gun down

945
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,180
or your pretty little wife

946
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,583
is gonna have her eyes cut out of her head.

947
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:33,823
You said you never hurt a woman.

948
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:38,443
I haven't, but he has.

949
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:46,030
My daughter has laid

950
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:48,730
in her grave for 12 years,

951
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:51,640
while her murderers have walked free.

952
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,770
We didn't murder anyone.

953
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:54,700
It was an accident.

954
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,843
She trusted you.

955
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:00,400
She trusted you because you were her countryman.

956
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,123
Not one man there knew she was inside. Ask him!

957
01:23:05,217 --> 01:23:09,403
(laughs) Not one man there draws breath, except you.

958
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,993
We thought it was you in there.

959
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:18,943
No, only my heart.

960
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,340
Make it slow.

961
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:32,763
Jeb! (whimpering)

962
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:38,680
You swear, you won't hurt her. You'll let her go.

963
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,720
No, no, Jeb!

964
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,223
On my child's grave.

965
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,390
You can't trust him.

966
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:53,224
No.

967
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:56,598
No, no, no, no!

968
01:23:58,888 --> 01:24:00,535
(Hattie groaning)

969
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:05,524
(blows thudding)
(men groaning)

970
01:24:05,524 --> 01:24:06,357
No, no!

971
01:24:08,107 --> 01:24:11,824
Ain't having no more little bastards now!

972
01:24:11,824 --> 01:24:14,438
(men laughing)

973
01:24:14,438 --> 01:24:16,623
(Hattie groaning)

974
01:24:16,623 --> 01:24:19,026
Hope you don't mind, Jebediah.

975
01:24:19,026 --> 01:24:20,753
The pleasure's all mine.

976
01:24:20,753 --> 01:24:22,200
You son of a bitch!

977
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:26,246
(Gold Tooth laughing)
(Hattie screaming)

978
01:24:26,246 --> 01:24:27,913
Come on, princess!

979
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,663
His daughter? Why did you never tell me.

980
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:53,233
Bad enough if I had to kill men for the Confederacy,

981
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,440
I murdered a child for the union.

982
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,240
It wasn't murder. You didn't know.

983
01:25:01,278 --> 01:25:02,463
It doesn't matter to him.

984
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,030
When he finishes what he is gonna do,

985
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:10,026
you ride outta here and don't look back.

986
01:25:10,026 --> 01:25:12,609
I'm not leaving, now or ever.

987
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:17,577
(horse whickering)

988
01:25:17,577 --> 01:25:20,410
(bird screeching)

989
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:25,333
(birds chirping)

990
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:33,347
(men laughing)

991
01:25:33,347 --> 01:25:36,097
(birds chirping)

992
01:25:47,346 --> 01:25:50,179
(hooves thudding)

993
01:25:54,051 --> 01:25:59,051
(horse whickering)
(birds chirping)

994
01:26:05,441 --> 01:26:08,191
(horse neighing)

995
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:13,820
(Jeb and Hattie groaning)

996
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,520
Well. Mrs. McAllister,

997
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,673
pride goeth before a fall.

998
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:25,150
(men laughing)

999
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:30,150
Now, I think that you deserve to have a front row seat

1000
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:34,600
for this trial because of your close relationship

1001
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,923
with the accused.

1002
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,013
Jebediah McAllister,

1003
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:47,620
you are here by charged with crimes against God

1004
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,783
and the Confederate States of America,

1005
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,783
including a murder of a child.

1006
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:57,973
How do you plead?

1007
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,680
I have done what I have done.

1008
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,880
You have heard the confession.

1009
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:07,940
Don't hit my wife!

1010
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,697
Gentlemen of the jury-

1011
01:27:11,697 --> 01:27:12,530
(Jeb groaning)
Wahoo!

1012
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:14,440
How do you find the defendant?

1013
01:27:16,747 --> 01:27:21,010
(laughs) Guilty as hell, Captain.

1014
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:22,033
Guilty as hell.

1015
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:27,520
(men laughing)

1016
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,158
You got no right.

1017
01:27:29,158 --> 01:27:29,991
(blow thudding)

1018
01:27:29,991 --> 01:27:32,710
(Jeb growling)

1019
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:34,963
Look what you have wrought, McAllister.

1020
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:39,440
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

1021
01:27:41,271 --> 01:27:44,320
You don't give a damn what I have to say.

1022
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,033
Go on, do what you gotta do.

1023
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,200
No!

1024
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,387
Are you familiar with the book of Romans?

1025
01:27:51,387 --> 01:27:55,097
(Hattie screaming)

1026
01:27:55,097 --> 01:27:59,647
"For all, have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."

1027
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:03,700
And I have no doubt that God will forgive you-

1028
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,533
No!

1029
01:28:04,533 --> 01:28:06,020
Through the blood of his Son.

1030
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,128
But I ain't God.

1031
01:28:12,128 --> 01:28:15,804
(Hattie screaming)

1032
01:28:15,804 --> 01:28:17,387
I'll do anything!

1033
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:20,580
I said, I'd do anything!

1034
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:23,583
Anything?

1035
01:28:26,621 --> 01:28:27,940
(Hattie panting)

1036
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,023
Each man here.

1037
01:28:30,032 --> 01:28:31,960
(men laughing)

1038
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,733
Entirely of your own free will.

1039
01:28:37,657 --> 01:28:38,583
Hattie, no.

1040
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,103
Well.
Not for me.

1041
01:28:43,465 --> 01:28:45,252
Hattie, no!
What do you say?

1042
01:28:45,252 --> 01:28:46,810
(men laughing)

1043
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:48,393
Hattie, no.

1044
01:28:49,463 --> 01:28:51,213
Don't do it!
Woo-ie!

1045
01:28:53,008 --> 01:28:54,073
(Hattie groaning)

1046
01:28:54,073 --> 01:28:55,656
Hattie, no.

1047
01:28:56,814 --> 01:28:58,314
Don't do it, no!

1048
01:28:59,674 --> 01:29:00,507
Hattie!

1049
01:29:01,646 --> 01:29:05,014
(gun firing)
(Jeb groaning)

1050
01:29:05,014 --> 01:29:08,448
(Hattie groaning)

1051
01:29:08,448 --> 01:29:11,263
(cupboard thudding)
(Hattie groaning)

1052
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:12,580
Now I expect you to conduct yourself

1053
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:15,713
like a Southern gentleman in there. (laughs)

1054
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,920
I am going to allow you to watch your wife,

1055
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,460
make herself into a whore

1056
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:29,990
and then I'm gonna kill ya just the same.

1057
01:29:35,316 --> 01:29:38,399
(Long Hair laughing)

1058
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:54,687
Take off your gun belt and leave it by the door.

1059
01:29:56,410 --> 01:29:58,310
I can put some perfume on if you like.

1060
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,613
I got a bottle in just last year from New York.

1061
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:16,868
(Hattie panting)

1062
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:24,662
(blow thudding)
(Hattie groaning)

1063
01:30:24,662 --> 01:30:27,412
(Hattie moaning)

1064
01:30:28,826 --> 01:30:33,826
(blows thudding)
(Hattie groaning)

1065
01:30:36,563 --> 01:30:39,377
(blow thudding)
(Hattie groaning)

1066
01:30:39,377 --> 01:30:44,377
"And behold, the pale rider which sat on him,

1067
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:46,017
his name was Death."

1068
01:30:52,267 --> 01:30:55,267
(Hattie whimpering)

1069
01:30:58,019 --> 01:30:59,784
"And Hell followed with him."

1070
01:30:59,784 --> 01:31:04,784
(blow thudding)
(Gold TOoth laughing)

1071
01:31:06,819 --> 01:31:09,569
(Hattie moaning)

1072
01:31:28,537 --> 01:31:31,590
(Hattie whimpering)

1073
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:34,757
(Gold Tooth laughing)

1074
01:31:38,622 --> 01:31:41,455
(Hattie groaning)

1075
01:31:43,384 --> 01:31:48,384
(knife thudding)
(Gold Tooth gurgling)

1076
01:31:59,079 --> 01:32:01,829
(Hattie panting)

1077
01:32:09,674 --> 01:32:12,424
(Hattie moaning)

1078
01:32:15,289 --> 01:32:18,456
(Gold Tooth gurgling)

1079
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:25,480
(Hattie panting)

1080
01:32:29,895 --> 01:32:32,812
(Hattie screaming)

1081
01:32:47,265 --> 01:32:52,265
Go to hell, you son of a bitch. (spits)

1082
01:32:55,827 --> 01:33:00,827
(Gold Tooth gurgling)
(Hattie panting)

1083
01:33:04,268 --> 01:33:06,601
Hey, hurry it up in there.

1084
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:11,764
My pecker's getting antsy. (laughs)

1085
01:33:11,764 --> 01:33:14,264
(gun firing)

1086
01:33:18,808 --> 01:33:23,808
Son of a bitch shot me again! (groaning)

1087
01:33:27,305 --> 01:33:29,949
Kill 'em all!

1088
01:33:29,949 --> 01:33:34,949
(gun firing)
(Long Hair groaning)

1089
01:33:39,332 --> 01:33:41,832
(guns firing)

1090
01:33:44,755 --> 01:33:49,755
(both groaning)
(guns firing)

1091
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:59,327
(door scraping)

1092
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:02,872
(Hattie panting)

1093
01:34:02,872 --> 01:34:05,122
I'm all right. All right.
