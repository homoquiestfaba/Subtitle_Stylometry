1
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:23,021
Why are you crying if you like it?

2
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:27,790
You like it a lot, they all love it

3
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,709
Stay still, I don't want to have to hurt you

4
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,604
That's it, stay still now

5
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:43,937
That's how I like em, all tied up

6
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,430
What happened?

7
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,816
Do you want me to leave?

8
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:27,025
No, stay there and keep quiet

9
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:32,453
Where were you Maco?

10
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:35,293
Training?

11
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:38,272
What were you practicing Maco,

12
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,922
karate?

13
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,649
What good is that shit?

14
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,645
You want to win a championship?

15
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:51,647
Do you think you're Van Damme?

16
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:53,104
No,

17
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,913
we'll get a client that knows kung fu

18
00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:00,098
and our bouncer Maco Gutierrez

19
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:02,842
will show off all his skills

20
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,502
and it'll be the match of the century

21
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:10,360
No joke, I just give the
word and everyone goes packing

22
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,872
If that's what I needed I'd
just get a gorilla, nothing else

23
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:17,048
So...

24
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:19,522
when you're at the gym

25
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:21,424
check the clock

26
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:24,509
If you're short three flying kicks

27
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:29,151
leave them for another
day, you need to be here

28
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:38,351
Now go, and don't forget

29
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:58,890
Open it

30
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,736
The way we're going I
doubt there will be a change

31
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,483
Your brother hasn't left
his room for over three years,

32
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:29,386
the only people he allows to enter
are the nurse Juanita, you and myself

33
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,886
I've thought about this a lot
Maco, I think our only option

34
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,707
is that you let me give him the
treatment I discussed with you

35
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,920
In the police files, a
new case of a missing girl

36
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,014
That's three minors this month

37
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,612
and the possibility that it's connected

38
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:55,849
to a ring of pedophiles
has their parents terrified

39
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,564
Let's hear from the father of the child

40
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:01,199
Well, it's been three days
since she disappeared

41
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,764
A neighbor saw her get in a car and

42
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,689
no one heard from her since

43
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:08,532
She's my only daughter,
please, if anyone knows anything

44
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:10,784
And on that same note,

45
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:14,686
an incident worthy of a comic
book or a Hollywood picture,

46
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:17,980
a brutal armed robbery was foiled

47
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,777
by a strange masked man

48
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:23,552
Here's one of the victims to tell us more,

49
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:26,071
our reporter Carol Valdivieso

50
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,485
This is no Iron Man, he doesn't
climb walls like a spider,

51
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,014
not rich enough to have a
Batmobile and he can't fly either

52
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,016
He's a man of flesh and
blood, just like you and I,

53
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:42,417
a man with courage and a strong will,
that on seeing people in danger

54
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,543
risked his life to save us

55
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,676
Yesterday evening in this very place
while I ate dinner with some friends

56
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,182
three men wearing ski
masks broke into the house,

57
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,538
beating us and tying us up

58
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,821
with the intention of stealing valuables,

59
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,111
but this remained only an intent as
there arrived a shadow, a silhouette

60
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,816
He appeared and disappeared like a mirage

61
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,624
and with his bare hands
he defeated three robbers

62
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:09,132
whose fire arms were of no use

63
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:12,628
Once they were incapacitated, he
escaped without leaving a trace

64
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:17,820
Hero, where are you? How
can I thank you personally?

65
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,612
People like you give hope to our society

66
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:26,699
and it fills us with pride to know
that a man with real guts still exists

67
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,612
From the scene of the crime this is Carol V

68
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:49,932
Yes?

69
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,605
Maco,

70
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:55,132
look

71
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,447
This started last night

72
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,256
He saw the television
in the hall from his room

73
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:11,282
and when they were giving the news of
that superhero who saved the journalist

74
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,444
he started yelling like a madman that
he wanted a television in his room

75
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:21,012
Well obviously we tried to
take advantage of the situation

76
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,732
to get him to come out,

77
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,337
but it didn't work, we couldn't convince him

78
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:29,484
So what we did is make him that hood,

79
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,675
and today

80
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,787
he's like this

81
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,220
Incredible

82
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:13,612
<i>If you have a problem don't hestitate
to write to me and I'll fix it</i>

83
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,659
Who the hell is this guy?

84
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:18,592
We've finally run into Spiderman

85
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,984
You'll see, I'm gonna
make you shit your pants

86
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,356
Alright, stay there, stay
there, this one's mine

87
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:01,880
Give him to me

88
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,543
Let's see what ya got

89
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:28,625
Let's fight like men

90
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,834
Come on, get up bastard

91
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:02,013
Excessive use of steroids?
A protein overdose?

92
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,261
A masked man carries out justice
again on the streets of Santiago

93
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:11,164
and it seems to be the same one that
saved our reporter Carol Valdivieso

94
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,043
In the early hours in downtown Santiago

95
00:22:14,074 --> 00:22:16,792
the flesh and blood
superhero has struck again

96
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:19,908
According to witness testimony
it could be the same man

97
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:23,152
who only three days ago
defeated three armed men

98
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,145
Let's go over the footage

99
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:29,481
The witness say the man was over
180 cm, had defined musculature

100
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,021
and was wearing a ridiculous
and somewhat effeminate outfit

101
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,964
The vigilante knocked out four
men at once without a problem

102
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:39,746
At the scene we found this note which
holds a message from the supposed superhero

103
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:42,045
The text is as follows: If you have a problem

104
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,077
don't hestitate to write to me and
I'll fix it elvigilante@zami.com

105
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,499
So now you know, if you need a
superhero don't think twice and

106
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:54,236
contact him at elvigilante@zami.com

107
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:58,996
That's all, we'll keep you informed on
this matter when more news is available

108
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:01,513
From downtown Santiago, this is Carol V

109
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:05,194
Mr. Vigilante, if you're going
to continue with your work

110
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:09,307
the least you could do is wear an outfit
that won't make the criminals laugh

111
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:27,768
Here Maco

112
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:32,224
He exists, I saw him on TV

113
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:17,865
<i>Vigilante, I'm a big fan of yours, you're
like my idol. I'm interested in helping you,</i>

114
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:20,564
<i>I have equipment that can help you in the
fight against crime. Accept me as your Robin</i>

115
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,000
<i>I await your response. Goodbye
with a hug, Pseudo Robin</i>

116
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:29,015
<i>Mr. Vigilante, my 10 year old son is
beaten every day by a gang of killers</i>

117
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,464
<i>Please end this abuse! Come and give that
gang a lesson! Tomorrow at 2 pm the gang will</i>

118
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:33,796
<i>be at the corner of Torres Bilboa and
Antonio Varras. I'm begging you, Mrs. Flora</i>

119
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:36,289
<i>Mrs. Flora, I'll be there
tomorrow. Your servant,</i>

120
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:42,812
Mission 01

121
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:48,249
Mirageman vs
The Bilboa Gang

122
00:28:38,627 --> 00:28:41,019
That e-mail we sent? That was a lie,

123
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,972
we just wanted to see if you'd
be dumb enough to come here

124
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:46,719
We've been waiting for you. You
think you're hard? We're harder

125
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,480
Come on kid, go get him

126
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,959
<i>The Vigilante Destroys a Violent Gang</i>

127
00:31:44,943 --> 00:31:46,796
<i>Big Headed Karate Expert
Thinks He's a Superhero</i>

128
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,911
<i>The Vigilante Signs His E-mails as Mirageman</i>

129
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,996
What, does he think he's
Robin Hood or something?

130
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:54,940
No, see, people

131
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:58,124
have to be helped by the police,
there's no need for a superhero

132
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:02,259
A personality of this type doesn't
help, it doesn't contribute at all

133
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,715
He shouldn't do it,
that's what the law is for

134
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,837
The guy must be way into
comics, Batman, Superman

135
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,661
I think he's going to
end up on a reality show

136
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:14,084
He's a clown, probably escaped
from some mental institution

137
00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:16,981
In my secret identity I'm all for him

138
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:20,138
The police doesn't do anything so it's
good that Mirageman does what he does

139
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:24,884
I think he's crazy. Honestly, someone
like that shouldn't be loose on the streets

140
00:32:25,114 --> 00:32:27,164
Everyone should be allowed
to do what they want, I think

141
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:32,073
Hello, I wanted to send a
message directly to Mirageman

142
00:32:32,372 --> 00:32:36,375
Mirageman, I know you're seeing
me. I'm a loyal follower of yours

143
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,443
and

144
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:41,059
I want to be a sort of
your assistant, a partner

145
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:45,261
I know how to defend myself
well, I'm a black belt

146
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:49,232
and you haven't responded to my e-mails so

147
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:52,660
I decided to join up with you and

148
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:56,608
besides I have two motorcyles
that are ready to be used

149
00:32:57,447 --> 00:32:59,108
Thank you sir, thank you

150
00:34:49,116 --> 00:34:51,516
<i>Mirageman, first of all congratulations,
your courage is inspiring</i>

151
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:53,946
<i>I'd like you to come to an exclusive
interview, it'll be very private,</i>

152
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:56,376
<i>just you, me and the cameramen, no one
else. You pick the place and we'll make a set</i>

153
00:34:56,401 --> 00:34:58,201
<i>The whole country wants
to see you. A kiss, Carol V</i>

154
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:02,059
<i>To Converse is Beautiful
with Carol Valdivieso</i>

155
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,701
He doesn't shoot spiderwebs, he doesn't fly,

156
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,197
he doesn't wear a cape and
doesn't even have a Batmobile

157
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,308
He takes the bus

158
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:12,630
Today's guest is the man of the moment

159
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:15,497
Some know him as The Vigilante,

160
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:18,268
he calls himself Mirageman

161
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:21,004
- Good evening
- Good evening

162
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,776
Thank you for agreeing to an interview

163
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:26,455
People would like to know what
the man behind the mask is like

164
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:28,684
What is your motivation?

165
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,955
I can't tell you my biggest motivation but

166
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:37,692
since that day I rescued
you from that assault

167
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:41,900
and I saw you on TV thanking me
I realized what my life's work is

168
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:45,120
You opened my eyes

169
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,807
Do you feel people take seriously?

170
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,672
To be honest I don't care what people think

People

172
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:00,911
and the press say you're a clown,

173
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:06,768
that you dedicate yourself to things
that don't matter and that you don't help

with the criminal problem in Chile

175
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:12,380
What do you think of that?

176
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,924
Does that hurt or do you not care?

Mirageman, I have a mission you can't refuse

183
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:07,994
Investigations have confirmed that
the children that have disappeared

184
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:11,120
over the last two months have been
victims of a ring of pedophiles

185
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:13,679
I know where the leader of the gang is hiding

186
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:16,180
and it's likely that the
missing girl is there too,

187
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:21,159
but the investigations department doesn't
have enough proof to raid the place

188
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,698

of ending this macabre abuse

Two weeks have gone by

and Mirageman the vigilante has not appeared

215
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,321
We suppose that the numerous accusations

216
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:33,778
from the people and press
over his mediocre efforts

217
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:36,407
made him finally leave the-

218
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:58,838
It's a shame what happened

219
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:02,747
We saw so much progress in your brother,

220
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:06,156
one day he nearly left his room,

221
00:45:06,534 --> 00:45:08,639
the nurses were praying he would

222
00:45:11,053 --> 00:45:12,579
but he changed his mind

223
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:17,531
Curiously, when that superhero
stopped appearing in the news

224
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,094
his condition worsened

225
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:23,049
And now he's like this,

226
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:26,404
he doesn't want to come out
and he doesn't let anyone in

227
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,998
You know I paid for all
of those, all 30 of them!

228
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:58,701
Don't touch me you filthy faggot

229
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,724

00:46:00,754 --> 00:46:03,319

There you go you fucking faggot

245
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,419
The superhero who left us keeps
giving us things to talk about

246
00:47:25,454 --> 00:47:27,471
but not because of his deeds,
rather because of his fans

247
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:31,390
I can't say my name but
I'm known as Pseudo Robin

248
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:35,462
Because of Mirageman's absense a citizen
who prefers to be called Pseudo Robin

249
00:47:35,497 --> 00:47:37,108
has decided to replace him

250
00:47:37,263 --> 00:47:41,624
This morning, this new masked
man was caught on camera

251
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:45,499
When two thugs tried to steal a car stereo

252
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,514
Pseudo Robin made his official debut

253
00:47:48,084 --> 00:47:49,588
When I was going home

254
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:52,963
and I found two guys that were stealing

255
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:56,692
the radio cover, that's this

256
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:58,383
I managed to get it from them

257
00:47:58,766 --> 00:48:02,544
I didn't win the fight, but I recovered
the cover, that's what's important

258
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,687
As you can see

259
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:07,252
I had a little beating
there, my arm is all dirty

260
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:10,366
It isn't much but I survived

261
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,120
Since I was small I wanted to be a superhero

262
00:48:14,155 --> 00:48:18,231
and I was motivated by that
hero that was on TV, Mirageman

263
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,796
We need Mirageman, he's the sort of
superhero we could use around here

264
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:25,139
I do what I can to defend people,

265
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:26,903
I do good just like he does

266
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:29,509
but I can't be alone and

267
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:32,229
I sent him an offer a

268
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:36,539
while ago, I sent an e-mail saying I had two
bikes in perfect condition, ready to be used

269
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,439
so I'd like him to get motivated
and call me so we can go into action

270
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:45,682
When we pointed out that his deeds along with
Mirageman's are mediocre and don't matter

271
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:47,364
Pseudo Robin reacted

272
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:49,523
What do you mean?

273
00:48:49,553 --> 00:48:53,071
Didn't you see me guarding that car

274
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,134
from those people stealing the radio?

275
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:58,747
Don't talk nonsense, I'm getting bored of it

276
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:02,707
How can you crap on a superhero
who's only trying to do good?

277
00:49:02,903 --> 00:49:04,544
You have to draw the line somewhere

278
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:07,819
- Thank you very much
- Let me see that for a bit

279
00:49:08,598 --> 00:49:11,886
I want to send a message to
all the thugs, the gangsters

280
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:13,802
that they should take care because

281
00:49:13,837 --> 00:49:17,513
if Mirageman isn't here
than I am, so be careful

282
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,805
The kidnapping of our
reporter Carol Valdivieso

283
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:36,593
has the whole network in an uproar

330
01:05:51,087 --> 01:05:52,354
Easy man,

331
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:55,233
I'm here to help you

332
01:05:56,313 --> 01:05:59,574
My name is Moli, Juan Moli

333
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:03,522
Don't worry, no one knows about you

334
01:06:04,202 --> 01:06:07,277
I've taken care of manipulating
information so you aren't discovered

335
01:06:07,904 --> 01:06:09,675
I want you to know something man,

336
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:13,089
I believe in you, I believe in what you do,

337
01:06:14,946 --> 01:06:16,766
and if you agree to work with me

338
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:19,994
I'll make sure no one learns your identity,

339
01:06:20,885 --> 01:06:23,037

343
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:33,685
with a whole country mocking you,

344
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:36,650
but that was always a possibility, right?

345
01:06:37,498 --> 01:06:40,762
Or did you think that the
media would take you seriously?

346
01:06:42,048 --> 01:06:43,285
You know Maco,

347
01:06:44,408 --> 01:06:47,778
you're the man with the most
guts I've ever met, I admire you

348
01:06:48,189 --> 01:06:50,265
and I think you shouldn't quit

349
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:54,243
For the first time I saw people
let go of their fear, grasp hope,

350
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:57,210
don't abandon them,

351
01:06:57,211 --> 01:06:59,562
don't let them be afraid again

352
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,886
Show them all you're real

353
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:05,818
You know, I've made a lot of
progress on the pedophile case

354
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:09,902
I think we have a chance to
finish them off now, right now

355
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:13,499
Mirageman,

356
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:17,000
we can save a child

357
01:07:21,421 --> 01:07:23,274
Don't give up the fight

358
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:26,419
Don't give up on her

359
01:10:06,397 --> 01:10:08,077
Mission 30

360
01:10:09,596 --> 01:10:12,110
Mirageman vs
The Pedophile Ring

361
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:13,250
Take 2

362
01:17:54,308 --> 01:17:55,410
Run

363
01:19:00,597 --> 01:19:01,890
Good evening

364
01:19:02,455 --> 01:19:04,894
We open todays news

365
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:08,067
with a moving story

366
01:19:08,646 --> 01:19:11,366
Mirageman, our national hero,

367
01:19:12,091 --> 01:19:15,075
gave his life to rescue a six year old girl

368
01:19:15,926 --> 01:19:19,330
Carol Valdivieso, who followed
his career from the beginning,

369
01:19:19,524 --> 01:19:21,278
tells us what happened

370
01:19:22,089 --> 01:19:24,425
In the early hours of the
morning in this very place,

371
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:28,662
Mirageman, after destroying the
pedophile ring, was murdered

372
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,274
However, his remains
have still not been found

373
01:19:31,304 --> 01:19:33,586
though they are believed to
be at the bottom of this tank

374
01:19:33,849 --> 01:19:37,854
He never sought anyone's recognition, he
helped while asking for nothing in exchange

375
01:19:38,496 --> 01:19:41,514
and he even gave his life so
that justice could be served

376
01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:44,055
This man, after being the
national laughingstock,

377
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:46,978
vindicates himself today by
carrying out the most heroic

378
01:19:47,108 --> 01:19:49,239
act in recent decades in our country

379
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:53,514
In the interview I had with him I asked
him why he decided to become a superhero

380
01:19:54,036 --> 01:19:55,593
and he said that

381
01:19:56,434 --> 01:19:58,398
I opened his eyes

382
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:05,994
I'd like to take this moment
to ask for forgiveness

383
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:08,375
publicly

384
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:11,086
for having been involved in this

385
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:14,858
If I did it it's because
it was part of my job

386
01:20:15,652 --> 01:20:18,006
and because I thought it was the right thing

387
01:20:20,069 --> 01:20:22,366
Maybe I realized things too late

388
01:20:23,362 --> 01:20:24,862
I tried...

389
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:29,105
I tried to find you Mirageman,
and wherever you may be

390
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:32,960
perhaps you didn't read the e-mail I wrote

391
01:20:33,343 --> 01:20:35,199
where I asked for your forgiveness

392
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,222
for having tarnished your image

393
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:44,189
and where I thanked you for being the
only one who had ever seen your eyes

394
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:48,326
I swear to keep the secret

395
01:20:49,828 --> 01:20:53,842
and believe me when I say you were very noble

396
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:57,941
in your struggle for justice

Mirageman,

404
01:21:32,382 --> 01:21:33,598
buddy,

405
01:21:34,596 --> 01:21:37,013
I'm asking for my bike back because

406
01:21:37,344 --> 01:21:40,574
I need it, someone's asking for it and

407
01:21:40,575 --> 01:21:43,226
you know that what's done is done

408
01:21:43,742 --> 01:21:47,643
and now I need it, I need
it today, I have to return it

409
01:21:47,856 --> 01:21:50,970
Alright man, call me buddy
