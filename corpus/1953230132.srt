1
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,499
As a child, you spent hours on this swing.

2
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,332
Why the long face?

3
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,165
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,165
Did you have another love before grandpa?

5
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,707
He was the only man in my life.

6
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,957
I married because I had no choice,
but I learned to love him.

7
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,582
Back then they said:

8
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,007
"A woman without a trade has two options:

9
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,624
Marriage or prostitution."

10
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,624
That's about the same.

11
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,915
What if you could start anew?

12
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,457
- Would Pepe be the man of your life?
- No.

13
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,124
If I could start anew

14
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,290
I'd get fucked as much as I could.

15
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,707
Everyone should share your ideas.

16
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,457
A man who gets laid is a super macho.

17
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,207
If it's a woman, she's a slut.

18
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,665
- Sexual equality.
- Forget what they say!

19
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,332
If they made love more and spoke less...

20
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,548
- It would be better.
- It's not that simple.

21
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,749
What isn't?

22
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,415
Pay no mind, grandma.

23
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,540
- It's hard to explain.
- You know what you should do?

24
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,749
Look.

25
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,332
Jot down your doubts, ideas,
problems on a sheet of paper,

26
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,082
but interrogatively

27
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,582
so you can see them from
outside and understand them.

28
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,374
I did that at you age, and it helped a lot.

29
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,457
And I still do, but so as not to forget.

30
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,999
Dinner is ready.
Come on.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,124
When you made love with grandpa,
how was it?

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,790
You're very curious.

33
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,749
Come, I've made shellfish
meatballs for you.

34
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,082
Enough for you to take to Barcelona.

35
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,499
I lost my virginity on
the 17th of July, 1993,

36
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,499
at 2:46 in the morning.

37
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,082
It was during a vacation period,
when I was 15.

38
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,415
You never forget a moment like that.

39
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,624
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

40
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,374
I remember I felt nothing,

41
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:35,040
just deep shame for not having bled, and

42
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,415
that strange feeling of
having pissed in bed.

43
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,457
I left with the excuse of the toilet,

44
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,624
with the feeling my experience with Edouard

45
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,790
couldn't be like that.
A feeling that

46
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,207
made me go back to him.
I was lacking something.

47
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,207
But, what are you doing here?

48
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,499
- Again.
- Once again?

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,957
No, hundreds of times.

50
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,165
Hundreds of times.

51
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,499
That strange release of energy aroused

52
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,624
in me a desire to communicate
through my body,

53
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:56,790
a curiosity to experience
sensations through a kiss,

54
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,499
a caress or the contact of my skin.

55
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,540
14 years after my
first experience with Edouard

56
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,665
I live in Barcelona and still have
the same urge to experiment

57
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,457
through my body.

58
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,832
DIARY OF A NYMPHOMANIAC

59
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:13,124
- My diary, it was here.
- You're writing a diary?

60
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,457
- I follow your advice.
- I didn't tell you to.

61
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,290
Just to jot down your problems
for a better perspective.

62
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,290
Diaries are for lonely people.

63
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,499
That's not true.

64
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,540
They have something to tell.

65
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,915
Because their life is different.

66
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,624
And they always hope that
someone will discover it,

67
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:34,249
read it to get to know the
true personality of the author.

68
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,332
Right, because they feel lonely.

69
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,415
It's the third blackout this week.

70
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,582
- The dark still scares you.
- This lighter doesn't work.

71
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,040
Don't speak badly of me in your diary.

72
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,207
Of course not.

73
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,957
Could you write something for me?

74
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,540
That you're not alone, that I'm with you.

75
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,999
It's about time.

76
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,290
I'm unbearable in the dark.

77
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,040
Unbearable.

78
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,165
You smell of fields,
of wet, recently cut grass.

79
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,624
Why don't you stay over?

80
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,457
No, I can't.

81
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,707
Tomorrow I have a meeting and
must prepare my presentation.

82
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,207
Alex, why don't you ever stay
to sleep with me? Please?

83
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,165
You don't want me to sleep.

84
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,290
No.

85
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,415
Don't you ever get tired?

86
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,790
Val, I can't keep up with your pace.

87
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,374
Besides, I told you
I have a meeting tomorrow.

88
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,582
Come on.

89
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,165
Hassan.

90
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,374
Valerie.

91
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,082
Nice to hear you.

92
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,124
You disappeared into thin air
but I found you?

93
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,915
I'll be in Barcelona this week.
I want to see you?

94
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,415
- How about Thursday?
- Okay, I'll call you. A kiss.

95
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,790
- Who was that?
- Hassan.

96
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,874
- He's coming?
- I'll see him Thursday.

97
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,124
Back to my desk, things are getting rough.

98
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:42,999
What is?

99
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,665
They're restructuring.

100
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,957
I've heard that ever since I'm here.

101
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,707
Yeah, well...

102
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,665
I've been asked what
I feel when I make love.

103
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,790
It's like a mix of energy with the
other person that makes me fly

104
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,665
and merge with the cosmos.

105
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,540
The energy of my orgasm is a
small part of me that goes

106
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,165
and ends up mixing with the universe.

107
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,999
A sidereal trip that takes me to infinity.

108
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,415
In my country they say Allah
told the south wind that he'd

109
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,582
create the Arabian horse from it.

110
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,915
"So be it", said the wind.

111
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:44,415
He held a puff and tied it
to the horse's mane

112
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,874
so it wouldn't forget where it came from,

113
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,624
but it turned out to be so fast

114
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,832
and cunning that no one could
ride it, and it was Ishmael,

115
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:59,874
the first faithful, who was able
to tame one of them

116
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:05,124
and called it Kuhaylan, the Black Antelope.

117
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,040
You're more difficult to tame
than that first horse.

118
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,332
I don't know how to name you.

119
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,707
Are you calling me wild?

120
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:14,915
Yes.

121
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,332
I think I've never fucked you in a bed.

122
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,124
We can do that now, if you want.

123
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,207
Although... I've just had
a better idea.

124
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,832
Here, look.

125
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,540
Where are they?
You've hidden them again?

126
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,374
No.

127
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,499
Not now, Hassan, please.

128
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:02,415
I don't feel like it right now,
not today, no.

129
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:03,832
Here they are!

130
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,290
No, please.

131
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,665
No.

132
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,582
Not today.

133
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,374
Yes, yes, today.
Look, look, come on.

134
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,832
Good morning.

135
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,165
Be careful, Val, you're late again.

136
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,999
Want one?

137
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,249
I don't want to even see them,
I need coffee.

138
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,832
I bought a dress for Marcos' wedding.

139
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,540
When I tried it on I realized
I couldn't zip it up.

140
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,374
So I cried like a baby and
then I called you.

141
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,249
You knew about Hassan.

142
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:16,082
I forgot, but I never find
you when I need you anyway.

143
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,415
I'm thinking of publishing
an ad to find a boyfriend.

144
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,290
An ad?
What do you mean?

145
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,874
You have to stop being obsessed.

146
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,374
How can you find him not going out?

147
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,582
I don't want just one-night stands.

148
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,915
You must try before falling in love.

149
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,915
I need to fall in love, Val,

150
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,749
find a man who loves me and

151
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,207
perhaps buy me flowers now and then.

152
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,707
I rather he fucks well.
I'll buy the flowers.

153
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,207
I can't stand not having anyone
to talk to at home,

154
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:48,374
to wake up alone and find
half a lemon in the icebox.

155
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,790
Love fills iceboxes and mine's
been empty for a long time.

156
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,582
I was worried. You didn't call
yesterday to say good night.

157
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,207
I got home late.
I had dinner with some friends.

158
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,249
- Did you like the meatballs?
- Yes, delicious.

159
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,957
I'm hanging up.
I must finish your sweater?

160
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:14,124
- I love you, I love you.?
- Me too. Till tomorrow, grandma.

161
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,124
Tame me.

162
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,040
- What?
- Tame me.

163
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,457
You deserve some flowers.

164
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,207
I want to fuck all night long.

165
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,915
I can't. I can't. I can't, Val.

166
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,249
- I have to go.
- What's the matter?

167
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,665
No, Val. Val, Val, Val, Val.

168
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,832
I have to tell you something.

169
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,290
- You have a girlfriend.
- You knew?

170
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,249
I imagined but, don't worry,
I'm not jealous.

171
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,915
Besides, I never asked you if you
were alone. It's not my problem.

172
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,874
I didn't think you'd take it like that.

173
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,957
You wanted me to cry?

174
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,832
Val,

175
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,624
we must stop seeing each other.

176
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,874
I want to fly.

177
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,999
Val, Val, Val.

178
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:11,040
Haven't you understood?
Can't you think of anything else?

179
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,874
You got a problem.
You can't spend all day

180
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,249
thinking about fucking.

181
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,499
I do, but you're an S.O.B..

182
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,499
Don't ever call me again, okay?

183
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:28,957
Never!

184
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,040
Fuck!

185
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,249
Alex, another man who has left me.

186
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,874
The loneliness, the silence.

187
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,540
I need some air.

188
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,790
What? Are you new here?

189
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,457
This is my turf, baby! Beat it!
Go work somewhere else.

190
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,665
Some days I'd spend hours in
the shower, feeling the water,

191
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,082
forgetting everything.

192
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,457
But I can't get Alex off of my mind.

193
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,290
I liked him a lot.

194
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,832
Like him, many others just want to fuck me,

195
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,124
and I like that,

196
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,790
but it hurts

197
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,957
because, above all, I'm a woman.

198
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,499
Darling, I was calling to say good night,

199
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,332
but I guess your out having a good time?

200
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,290
You are so right!
Enjoy it while you're young?

201
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,707
Bye. A kiss.

202
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,832
It's not fair, Val, they're pigs.

203
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,124
You give them part of
your life, and they fire you.

204
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,665
Want a hand?

205
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,582
Forget it, I was fed up anyway.

206
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,999
Weren't you on a diet?

207
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,249
How can I be being so depressed?

208
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,957
You get it, I don't work here.

209
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:04,665
Yes?

210
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,957
So, Valerie can't attend to you,
she no longer works here. Bye.

211
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,624
Yes?
Speaking.

212
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,374
I got furious when I found
out they called you.

213
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,707
Thanks for coming, but there's no need.

214
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,707
I got a few days vacation at work.

215
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,915
I'd have come anyway.

216
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,332
Don't look like that, Val.
I've no intention of dying so soon.

217
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,665
It was just a slight problem.
My heart is holding out.

218
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,082
Doctors always exaggerate.

219
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,957
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

220
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,374
Val, I know you well.

221
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,499
Is it over a man?

222
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,415
One?

223
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,415
Over all of them.

224
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,749
Do you know what nymphomania is?

225
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,540
I think that's my problem.

226
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,582
I can't control it.

227
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,290
I need sex.

228
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,290
I see a man and I need him.

229
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,999
But no one understands that.

230
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,499
People stare at me.

231
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,915
It happens with strangers
that don't attract me.

232
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,249
I'm scared.

233
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,582
Scared of not being like other women.

234
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,249
Scared of being hurt someday.

235
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,624
Of not being able to live with
one man, not having a family.

236
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:50,374
Nymphomania, a man's invention
to make women

237
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,499
feel guilty if they break the rules.

238
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,707
Everyone is the way they are.

239
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,915
Never give up anything you really long for

240
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,582
because you'll regret it.

241
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,540
Believe me.

242
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,749
To me,

243
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,957
I think that you

244
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,374
don't dare to live your life.

245
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,124
Want a piece of advice?

246
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,499
Enjoy life

247
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,540
as much as you can.

248
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,999
And go get my sweater, I want to finish it.

249
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,290
You should rest, grandma.

250
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,332
I've rested enough.
Go on and get my knitting.

251
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,124
Go on.

252
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,124
CALL VAL

253
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:25,582
I've lost the only person
who understood me.

254
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:28,874
I feel absolutely alone.

255
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:35,582
I'd like to have the company
of a man to comfort me,

256
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,207
but I haven't the strength
to go looking for him.

257
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:40,957
I'm exhausted.

258
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,332
Darling, I was calling to say good night,

259
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,624
but I guess your out having a good time?

260
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,249
You are so right!
Enjoy it while you're young?

261
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,207
Bye. A kiss.

262
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,540
Darling, I was calling to say good night,

263
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,874
but I guess your out having a good time?

264
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,124
You are so right!
Enjoy it while you're young?

265
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,665
Bye. A kiss.

266
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,790
Darling, I was calling to say good night,

267
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:19,040
but I guess your out having a good time?

268
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:22,499
You are so right!
Enjoy it while you're young?

269
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,749
Bye. A kiss.

270
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:40,165
I called you a lot.
You could at least answer.

271
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,790
What happened?

272
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:49,082
I know that my sex life
is harming me, and that

273
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,832
I can't go on like this.

274
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,457
Although I'm sunk, I'm looking for work.

275
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:59,165
Okay, you're the person I need.
You speak English, you

276
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,374
have knowledge of marketing.

277
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:03,624
We sell a lot to France,

278
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,624
and you'd take care of our communications,

279
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,290
go with me to fairs,
and have a ham for Christmas.

280
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,040
- A ham?
- I give them to my employees.

281
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,290
You can't say we foreigners
don't integrate.

282
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:18,415
Interested?

283
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,082
I have another interview today.

284
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,957
- I'll let you know this week.
- Okay.

285
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,540
I see you're very observant.
You see, we're moving.

286
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:38,332
Why did you quit your last job?

287
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,499
They cut down on personnel,
including me, Mr...

288
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,540
Rijas, Jaime Rijas.

289
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:45,874
What?

290
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,915
Rijas and Associates, general manager.

291
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:52,499
You're a graduate in
business administration

292
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:57,499
and applied foreign languages.
A really impressive curriculum.

293
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,790
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

294
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,707
- Are you married?
- No.

295
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,749
Engaged?

296
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,915
I think that is irrelevant.

297
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,374
Yes, you're right, but in this job

298
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,332
one must travel the world over.

299
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,124
There's no commitment on my part.

300
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,915
Would you like to ask me anything else

301
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,290
on the salary, or whatever?

302
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:25,374
What perfume do you use?

303
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:32,749
Well now, you really have

304
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,790
a very, very good sense of smell.

305
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,957
It's a special lavender perfume.

306
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,332
Yes?

307
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,207
Valerie?

308
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,457
Yes, speaking.

309
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,415
It's Jaime Rijas?
How are you?

310
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:09,290
Oh, hello.

311
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,457
I've made a decision, but have a problem

312
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:15,124
and would like to talk to you in person.

313
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,499
What sort of problem?

314
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:19,915
I think I can speak openly to you.

315
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:23,290
Would you mind talking
about this over a drink?

316
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,290
Can't we do that in your office?

317
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,582
I'd prefer a quieter place?
My secretary

318
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,957
interrupts constantly.

319
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:04,290
I'm 39 and have always been
a businessman with clear ideas,

320
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:09,082
but nothing like this had
ever happened to me before.

321
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,915
And I thought it was important
to talk about it with someone

322
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,124
without prejudice, and you're that person.

323
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,249
Why? You hardly know each other.

324
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,332
Precisely because we don't
know each other at all,

325
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,457
your opinion will be more objective.

326
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,207
That all depends.

327
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,165
I met a woman at work and,

328
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,915
due to my status as director general,

329
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,874
I don't know what to do.

330
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,749
I've always controlled my
impulses but his thing,

331
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,207
- it's getting out of hand.
- She works in your company?

332
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,582
Not yet.

333
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,790
Does she know?

334
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:00,290
She's smart and I think she has realized

335
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,957
there's something more,

336
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:04,415
but she's made no comment and

337
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,957
I'm afraid she may not
feel the same for me.

338
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,415
Sorry. Did I step on you?

339
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,832
- The table's small.
- That's okay.

340
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:22,374
You're beautiful, Valerie.
I'd like to buy you a rose, but

341
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,207
I have no money.

342
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:27,665
Or do I?

343
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,707
I forgot to tell you something.

344
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,999
The job was yours until this evening.

345
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:55,332
But from now on I don't think
I couldn't order you around.

346
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:06,415
- Good night.
- Good night.

347
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,290
Any relatives?

348
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,749
Two grown boys, but he's
been separated for years.

349
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,124
Isn't he too old for you?

350
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,582
He's the smartest man I've ever met.

351
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:22,915
He's intelligent, polite, cultured,
caring. He's got it all.

352
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,624
I had never felt like this before.

353
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:30,957
When I see him my heart leaps
and his hands drive me crazy.

354
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,165
Val, you, in love?

355
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:36,874
As a child I'd let my balloons go.

356
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:41,290
I liked to watch them rise.
It made me feel free.

357
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:45,332
I don't know if I'm in love,
but I like him a lot.

358
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:48,249
He's different from all the other men.

359
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,165
Maybe you too were born for matrimony.

360
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,624
Not so fast.

361
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:56,457
I feel a normal woman
for the first time in my life,

362
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,082
a feeling that fascinates me,

363
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,207
to be like all other women I meet.

364
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:09,582
I see Jaime nearly every day.
I realize I've discovered something

365
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,165
as important as sex.

366
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:16,124
The love of a man.

367
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:24,499
I have fallen madly in love
for the first time in my life.

368
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:28,457
He takes me to the best places,
and always picks me up.

369
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:32,124
In his Jaguar?
I'd like that, really.

370
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:34,082
A boyfriend with a Jaguar.

371
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,290
And how is he in bed?

372
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,374
I don't know yet.

373
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,290
You're in love!

374
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,790
Jaime, you need to use a condom.

375
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,874
Really? I want to feel you.

376
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,499
- Is it necessary?
- Yes.

377
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,290
Okay, no problem.

378
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,707
I'll go get one.

379
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:54,207
And while you're at it, take
the cat out. We should be alone.

380
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,499
Caress me.

381
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:37,415
Sorry I was so fast,
but I've had a tiring day.

382
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,290
Don't worry. It's okay.

383
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,415
Could you leave the light on?

384
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:05,624
You should fear nothing now, you have me.

385
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:10,582
And tomorrow will be a very,
very special day.

386
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,957
You'll see.

387
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:23,874
Today we finally made love.
I hardly felt anything,

388
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:26,374
like the first time with Edouard.

389
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,874
But I love him and he loves me.

390
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,665
That's the most important to me.

391
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,499
- It's marvellous.
- Yes.

392
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:52,499
The office. Don't look,
it's all a mess right now.

393
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,915
I'm living a marvellous dream with Jaime

394
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,374
from which I don't want to wake.

395
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:07,290
A room with a view,
wooden floors. Nice?

396
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:11,415
The corresponding full bathroom,

397
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,999
and here is our bedroom.

398
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:18,040
Look, and the bathroom...

399
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:22,165
This closes completely.

400
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,582
Black out, really.

401
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,165
It's the perfect size.
3 bedrooms.

402
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:32,832
Yes, our room, the office downstairs,

403
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,665
and another for...

404
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,332
Guests.

405
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,124
Yes, and...

406
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:45,249
the other day you said you
wanted children soon,

407
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,957
but don't take that as pressure, please.

408
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,124
The windows are 6 stories tall.

409
00:39:56,833 --> 00:40:00,249
I've always dreamed of a view of the sea,

410
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,124
but it's too expensive, darling.

411
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:07,957
Don't you worry, okay?

412
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,457
That's up to me, and period.

413
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,332
And how is he in bed?

414
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,999
Truthfully, nothing out of this world.

415
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,082
He comes too fast.
He says he works too much.

416
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:26,249
You always said sex is most important.

417
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,082
Maybe because I wasn't in love.

418
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,249
Val, I think it's a bit soon
to go live together.

419
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,332
You haven't been going out long.

420
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:40,999
You said I should change my life,
and I'm doing just that.

421
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,457
Being with him, I feel,

422
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:47,624
for the first time, no need for
anyone else. Besides, I'm nearly 29.

423
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:51,915
Maybe I should think about having kids.

424
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,415
- So that's it.
- One of many reasons.

425
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,582
A man who doesn't like animals worries me.

426
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,665
He's allergic to cat fur.

427
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,374
Okay, pay no mind to me.

428
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:05,374
I'm going through bad times.

429
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,415
- Will you take him?
- Yes.

430
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,665
- Can you zip me up?
- Sure.

431
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,624
- What are you looking at?
- The icebox.

432
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:26,040
- What's wrong with it?
- I love it.

433
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,082
Do you love me as well?

434
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,207
With that dress on, you look

435
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:39,165
beautiful.

436
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,374
To you?

437
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,707
Are you okay?

438
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:49,957
Of course I am, but I feel
a bit uncomfortable.

439
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:54,040
You're paying it all. You spent
a fortune on furniture.

440
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:57,624
What good is money if you can't spend it?

441
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,957
When you find a job,

442
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,707
we'll talk about this again.

443
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,207
See anything?

444
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:18,665
It's beautiful.

445
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:29,457
Thanks, Jaime, but you can't pay
it all and give me these gifts.

446
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:31,957
It's to say I love you.

447
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,749
Sorry, did I step on you?
The table's small.

448
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,624
What a son of a bitch!

449
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:54,957
What?

450
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:56,624
There's no need.

451
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:16,874
You fuck well. I can tell
you've been with many men.

452
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:21,415
I don't want to think about that now.

453
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,457
You're mine only.

454
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,415
Mine only.

455
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:26,999
Don't talk.

456
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,040
What are you doing?

457
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,332
Embrace me.

458
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,540
Aren't you afraid?

459
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:21,999
Not any longer.

460
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,874
Yes?

461
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,124
- Valerie?
- Yes, speaking.

462
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,249
- Hi, it's Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

463
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:38,165
Could I see you this morning?

464
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:41,249
Sure, I'll be there in
half an hour. See you.

465
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,707
I hired a girl, but she was a disaster.

466
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,624
She didn't last a week.

467
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:58,707
If you're willing,
you could start right now.

468
00:44:58,916 --> 00:44:59,999
Right now?

469
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,707
Yes, I need someone urgently.

470
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:06,040
We present the collection in
3 weeks. We're up to here.

471
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:08,832
We haven't spoken about money yet.

472
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,290
A ham for Christmas.
Right, Maite?

473
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:16,249
- A client is waiting.
- I'll be right there. Thanks.

474
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,124
Don't worry about money.
We'll reach an agreement.

475
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,207
Coffee?

476
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,540
Hello.

477
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,582
I have very good news.

478
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,249
Where were you?

479
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:40,582
- I've started to work.
- What?

480
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:43,665
I called your cell phone but it was off.

481
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:46,874
- Harry wants me to start right...
- Harry?

482
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,457
- They're...
- Who the fuck is Harry?

483
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,207
The boss, an Italian.

484
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,040
I've been hired by a fashion firm.

485
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:58,165
An Italian?
He hired you just like that?

486
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:01,249
Not knowing how you work?
How weird.

487
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:02,999
Isn't that weird?

488
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:06,332
You're still young and have a lot to learn.

489
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,915
What's wrong?

490
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:38,790
I thought you'd be happy about my job.

491
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,415
And I am. I am happy,

492
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,957
but I didn't expect it,

493
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,707
and that's why I reacted that way.

494
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,582
But I am happy.

495
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,124
Forgive me.

496
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,374
Really, forgive me.

497
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:37,915
That night, that marvellous dream
I thought I was living

498
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,415
began to turn into a nightmare.

499
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,249
I just give an account that I did not know

500
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:45,790
the person of which I had fallen in love.

501
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,957
When the catalogues?

502
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:54,332
They should be printed tomorrow.
You do it, Valerie.

503
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,915
Where is he?
I'm losing my patience!

504
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:02,124
- What's going on?
- I'll bust your chops!

505
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:03,457
What are you doing here?

506
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,332
So, you're the one who
wants to fuck my wife?

507
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,207
Why is she here so late?

508
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:15,332
You think I don't know what's going on?

509
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:17,332
You think I don't know?

510
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:19,874
Jaime,

511
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:25,374
go home. I'll be there soon.
Right away, darling. Wait for me.

512
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,207
I'll wait outside.

513
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:09,207
Get up. Come on, get up.

514
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,790
How are you?

515
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,082
Did you sleep well?

516
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:21,957
Darling, you know what I've thought?

517
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:25,415
That we could both use a trip.

518
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,165
Forgive me, my love.

519
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:34,290
Forgive me.
Truthfully, I am very stressed.

520
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,749
I can't forget my problems.

521
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,999
We'll go on vacation, and we'll be fine.

522
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:43,874
Don't touch me! It would
be best for us to separate.

523
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,124
Separate?

524
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:56,499
My darling, we can't separate.

525
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,415
I can't live without you.

526
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:02,165
If you leave me, I won't bear it.

527
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,207
My darling, my little love,

528
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:10,249
please.
You have to understand me.

529
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,207
Give me a chance, I'm in bad shape.

530
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,999
Jaime, you're not well.

531
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:22,624
You're a compulsive liar,
your moods are unpredictable.

532
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,124
You're aggressive, you come
to work and show me up.

533
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,374
You're not acting in a normal way.

534
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:41,790
- You need to see a doctor.
- I'll do as you wish.

535
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:45,249
Whatever you want, but don't leave me.

536
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:48,582
Please, you can't leave me.
I need you.

537
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,665
- When did you get here?
- Today.

538
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,457
You're unrecognizable.

539
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:35,207
You know what I'm thinking about?
Kuhaylan. Remember?

540
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:40,624
The first Arabian horse.
I think than man learned to tame it.

541
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:46,832
Honestly, you're unrecognizable,
Valerie. You need to be alone.

542
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,332
Look at me.

543
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:57,665
You know you can always count on me.

544
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:25,374
People don't change, but I had
hopes of doing so with Jaime.

545
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:29,082
Sonia was right. I'm blind

546
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,665
and, what's worse, I still love him.

547
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:38,249
I can't go on. All I want to do
is lose consciousness,

548
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,582
disappear from this world.

549
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:49,582
Oh, Val, Val! Why don't
you take a vacation?

550
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:51,915
It would do you well.

551
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:57,999
I appreciate it. You're right,
I can't work like this.

552
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,374
I can't concentrate.

553
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,999
And don't forget to take the ham.

554
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:06,332
Hit him with it and make it
look like an accident.

555
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:11,665
Were you not gay,
you and I would be together.

556
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:12,915
Oh, Madonna!

557
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:38,040
Yes, yes, that's it.
Do it. Don't stop.

558
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:44,665
Darling, look, I have a
Christmas present for you.

559
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,874
- What's your name?
- Vane.

560
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:52,165
Vane, this is Val.
Val, this is Vane.

561
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,582
We make up a perfect team.

562
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,374
Come here, my love.
Come here, love, come here.

563
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:03,749
Please, come here.

564
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,915
We could have a great time.

565
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:09,207
- What's your name?
- Vane.

566
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,915
Come, come on, my love,

567
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,790
come, come, come here.

568
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,874
Come, my darling.

569
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,332
What tits, huh?

570
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,207
What tits!

571
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:27,790
The biggest thing you've got, bitch.

572
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:30,374
You've got a piercing, huh?

573
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:35,290
That's enough.
Get off, off, off!

574
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,915
Where's my money?

575
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,249
I have no cash, you know?

576
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:58,249
- Where are my 100 euros?
- I don't know.

577
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,165
I have no idea.

578
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:21,832
Jaime, we're expecting a baby.

579
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:24,374
What?

580
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:28,332
We're expecting a baby.

581
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:30,665
That's impossible.

582
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,999
Why is it impossible?

583
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,499
I don't doubt you're expecting,
I doubt it's mine.

584
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,457
How can you say that?

585
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,707
You know why I doubt it?

586
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:49,832
Because I'm sterile for many years now.

587
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:53,874
You laid someone else and
want to dump it on me.

588
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:55,915
You're a monster.

589
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:59,999
And you are a hysterical piece of shit.

590
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:03,832
I've always wanted to tell
you this. You're a whore!

591
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,249
You lie all the time, like all whores!

592
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:09,540
I don't know how I stood you so long.

593
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,665
And that's it, the conversation is over.

594
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,915
Don't cry, you pig.

595
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,499
Don't cry, pig.

596
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:30,499
A baby is what I most wanted in this world.

597
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:35,290
You did right, Val. You're
still young for having kids.

598
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:39,457
I don't know what to do now.

599
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:43,457
I quit my job, spent my savings and,

600
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,624
thanks to him, I'm in deep debt.

601
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:49,415
I paid the rent for months.

602
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:51,332
Well, don't worry.

603
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,749
What, what is going on here?

604
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,915
Can't you see?
She is leaving.

605
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,374
What, you're clearing off?

606
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:15,165
My love,

607
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:18,374
- I beg you, baby.
- Leave her alone.

608
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:25,707
If you walk out that door,
I swear I'll kill you. Understand?

609
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,540
I'll kill you, you hear?

610
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,915
I am going to destroy you, bitch!

611
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,124
- You hear?
- I'll call the cops.

612
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,082
This is fuckin' shit!

613
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,040
Let's go, Val, we're out of here.

614
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,665
I beg you.

615
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:02,457
I beg you, please.

616
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:07,040
I swear I'll change, my love.

617
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:09,415
Forgive me, my love.

618
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,957
You can't go, my love.

619
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:20,207
You won't get away from me, you hear?

620
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:21,915
Whore!

621
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,290
No one leaves me, you know?

622
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:26,540
No one leaves me, you bitch!

623
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,957
You're coming to my place

624
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,332
until you get over that
son of a bitch bastard.

625
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:46,832
Val?

626
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:50,957
Hello.

627
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,999
Val.

628
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,499
Val, you can't go on like this.

629
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,124
Val, you have to react.

630
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,374
You look terrible.

631
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:00,957
How long have you been here?

632
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:04,207
Oh, my baby...

633
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:06,832
I'll help you clean all this up.

634
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,790
Look, I've brought food.
Come on.

635
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:27,082
Breaking off with Jaime
nearly cost me my life.

636
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:30,124
Seeing the depths of the pit, I want out

637
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:32,707
and to see the light again.

638
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,665
After several months without an orgasm

639
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:38,832
my body was beginning to rouse.

640
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,832
It was like waking from
a long, eternal lethargy.

641
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:45,707
I'm starving.

642
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:50,207
I know what I will do to
quench my appetite again.

643
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:57,999
- Hi.
- Hi.

644
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,415
- I think I made a mistake.
- No, it's here. Come in.

645
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:04,124
Come in.

646
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,582
- You're Val, right?
- Yes.

647
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,499
You called for the interview.

648
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:12,540
- I'm Cindy. One of the girls.
- It's a pleasure.

649
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,707
You'll be attended to right away.

650
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:18,999
- Cristina.
- Val, Valerie.

651
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:23,165
Valerie? A nice name. Let me
have a look, please. Thanks.

652
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:33,624
Have a seat, Val.

653
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,415
- Where have you worked?
- In this?

654
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:40,207
Yes, of course.

655
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,749
This is my first time.

656
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:43,957
Interesting. What can you do?

657
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:47,332
Everything, as long as it's with a condom.

658
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,915
That's fine.

659
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:51,624
Go with Cindy.

660
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,665
Use more make-up.

661
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:02,665
Clients don't pay for
what they have at home.

662
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:06,040
- I think I found a job.
- Tell me about it.

663
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,832
For what company?

664
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:09,540
In a brothel.

665
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:11,999
Come on, Val, that's not funny.

666
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,249
I start tomorrow.

667
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:19,749
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

668
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:22,332
Look,

669
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:25,832
we spend most of the time waiting.

670
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,874
Want to see the man of my life?

671
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,457
His name is Migue.

672
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:34,165
He lives with my mother near Rio.

673
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,915
I sent him there because
his father is a bastard.

674
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:43,540
I take all this for him, but I can't go on.

675
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,249
I must whisper.
These walls have ears.

676
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:50,624
Come on, girls, let's dance.

677
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:57,332
Are you going to behave?

678
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:07,082
Cindy.

679
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,207
I'm Mar.

680
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,540
I'm Stephanie.

681
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:32,499
- What's your name, child?
- Laura.

682
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:44,290
I'm Val.

683
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,374
Val, I want you.

684
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:11,999
- What do I have to do?
- That's up to you,

685
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,540
but he's always high.

686
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,707
He cannot have full sex.

687
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:19,124
A good hand job will make him happy.

688
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,874
A two-hour hand job?

689
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,874
You know, you play a little, massages...

690
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:28,249
This is no school, Val.

691
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:31,540
The client isn't going to gobble you up.

692
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,040
You look beautiful.

693
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:58,499
Hi.

694
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,374
You're new, aren't you?

695
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:04,540
Come on, get in the water with me.

696
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:18,415
Come here.

697
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,415
- You have a special smell.
- Really?

698
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:25,957
You like it?

699
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:31,207
- Let's go to bed.
- No. Let's stay here.

700
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,082
Fucking doesn't turn me on.

701
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:38,249
Okay, relax, we'll see what can be done.

702
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:56,124
Well, I'm from Seville.

703
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:01,499
I work for a machine company
that sells throughout Europe.

704
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,290
Fuck!

705
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:07,374
Stop, girl, or I'll go crazy.

706
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,540
Why the fuck did you stop?

707
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,374
Because you told me to.

708
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,540
You pay no attention to me.

709
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,624
Keep going, shit!

710
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:19,249
No one's ever done this to me before.

711
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:25,124
- Did you go to the April fair?
- No.

712
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:29,332
You know what's happened
to me all of a sudden?

713
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,582
- I've fallen in love with you.
- But we just met.

714
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,332
That's right, love at first sight.

715
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:39,082
Why don't we get into bed?

716
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,582
Okay, but just because I love you.

717
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,999
What a nice ass you've got!

718
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:57,249
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

719
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:00,665
Slap me again.

720
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,915
At that moment I felt a strange feeling.

721
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:12,249
The same as at 15, with Eduard.

722
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:14,415
I needed to know more,

723
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:17,957
to learn from this world I just entered.

724
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:24,999
What are you doing?

725
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:28,165
The first time is tough, I know.

726
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:31,124
We have all cried the first time.

727
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:34,624
But you get used to it,
it becomes an exercise.

728
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,499
- Are you okay?
- Of course I am.

729
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:44,915
- Where's my money?
- Here you are.

730
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,374
- How did it go?
- Fine, but a bit of a pain.

731
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:53,624
You expected a cultured, interesting man

732
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,999
with a pleasant conversation?

733
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,582
I remind you you're a whore.

734
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:04,207
You look tired.

735
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:06,624
Not at all, I'm delighted.

736
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:08,165
What do clients like?

737
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:09,624
A bit of everything.

738
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:13,332
Some want to tie you up,
others stick things in you.

739
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:17,207
You just gave me an idea.

740
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:28,624
That handsome is he!

741
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:31,082
His name is Giovanni.
He's Italian.

742
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,832
The other one's a pig.

743
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,499
They come to Barcelona often.
They're good clients.

744
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,999
I'll be right out.

745
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:46,540
Come on, you look divine.

746
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,790
It was a pleasure to meet you.

747
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,415
I hope you enjoyed it.

748
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:35,707
What an intense life.

749
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:38,040
I would like mine to be that way too.

750
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,207
What's your name?

751
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,749
Valerie.

752
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:26,499
I have a strange feeling

753
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:30,249
that here, somehow, time stands still.

754
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,582
You're just learning to be who you are.

755
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,165
What about you?

756
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:42,290
You are the future of my past.

757
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:45,874
And me, perhaps, the memory of your future.

758
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:01,374
It's not a difficult job, just different.

759
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:03,624
How can you say that?

760
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,999
I like to do it free, you know that.

761
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,165
And I get paid, what else could I want?

762
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,415
- Have you ever been spanked?
- What?

763
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,749
Try it. You'd be surprised.

764
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:19,874
We have too many preconceptions.

765
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:21,249
And those flowers?

766
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,665
A present from Pedro, a client.

767
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:25,374
- They're pretty.
- Yes.

768
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,707
Still thinking of Jaime?

769
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:29,040
Not at all.

770
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,999
I have an Italian client I like a lot.

771
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,832
Be careful, Val.

772
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,582
I've seen that look before.

773
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:41,082
- Keep it.
- No.

774
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,040
Don't be silly.

775
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,332
Yes, Cristina?

776
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,124
Okay, I'm on my way.

777
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:53,665
It's Giovanni.

778
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:01,832
Giovanni is different from
all other clients I've met.

779
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:04,290
I shivers when he touches me.

780
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:08,665
He makes me go to the cosmos, see stars.

781
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:11,915
I think I'm in love with him.

782
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,207
Thank you.

783
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,957
I live in Calabria because
mama lives there.

784
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:34,749
I spend most of the year travelling.

785
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:37,957
- What?
- Your left eyebrow.

786
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:41,124
- What's wrong with it?
- I like it.

787
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:42,999
That uncombed hair.

788
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:46,374
You know?

789
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:49,999
I communicate better with
my body than with words.

790
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:54,290
With a caress I describe things
that make me feel alive.

791
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:59,290
I'm scared, Giovanni, I like you too much.

792
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:04,165
Your smell is irresistible.

793
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,124
- What smell?
- The Mediterranean,

794
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:09,790
freshness, life.

795
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,832
I like you too much too.

796
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:15,915
- Give me your phone number.
- I can't.

797
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:20,499
- My boss would kill me.
- Your boss should pay you more.

798
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:23,540
Will you call me again this week?

799
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:26,082
Do you want to know the answer?

800
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:32,374
Look,

801
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:36,415
this proves that I will call you again.

802
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:40,207
Save it for me, and take good care of it.

803
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:46,040
I have to go.
Your time's up.

804
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:49,499
Although I'd like to sleep with you...

805
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,707
What did you say?

806
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:53,707
Nothing, forget it.

807
01:17:57,708 --> 01:17:59,165
What about the money?

808
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:02,249
I'm a disaster.

809
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:07,957
What if I pay you another hour?

810
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,999
This one is on me.

811
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:19,749
Val, be very careful.

812
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:24,790
Don't fall in love with him.
It's sheer logic.

813
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:28,165
It's impossible for a man
who goes with whores

814
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,332
to be loyal.
Believe me.

815
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:38,165
Valerie, you're beautiful.
Your new job suits you.

816
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,790
Although I'm jealous of the other men.

817
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,540
When does your plane leave?

818
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:45,332
- In 3 hours.
- Why, why don't you stay?

819
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,124
I have to go to Madrid.

820
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:50,957
We could order a Coca-Cola
and go to the bathroom.

821
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,415
I thought you dropped that.

822
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,249
I'm thirsty again.

823
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:07,457
I guess you'll give me a good discount.

824
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:10,457
A Coca-Cola and an opener, please.

825
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:29,374
Don't you like it?

826
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:31,540
Of course I like this suite but

827
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:33,832
I don't want to be your fiance, Pedro.

828
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:41,165
Val, listen to me.

829
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:44,499
I'll do whatever you want
for you to love me.

830
01:19:44,666 --> 01:19:47,749
And I won't say a word while we're fucking.

831
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,332
What I want is for you to marry me.

832
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,582
Look,

833
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:54,332
this is for you.

834
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,165
Fuckin' look at it.

835
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:01,124
- You don't like it?
- No.

836
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:05,749
I was given a similar one once.
I can't accept it.

837
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:08,499
Don't give me anything.

838
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:10,665
And no flowers, I hate flowers.

839
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:12,707
Pedro, you're pressing me.

840
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,707
Go see some other girls.

841
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,457
What are you saying?

842
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,915
I don't want others, I want you!

843
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:21,790
You're hurting me.

844
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:24,124
I won't marry you.

845
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,999
You're drunk.

846
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,957
- I had better go.
- Go, go?

847
01:20:30,416 --> 01:20:32,624
You know what this room costs me?

848
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:35,790
Do you know what this room costs me?

849
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:40,790
I pay you, and you'll do as I say.
You understand me?

850
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,665
Here's your fuckin' money.

851
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,749
Pick it up.

852
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,915
Pick it the fuck up!

853
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:53,582
Stay there on all fours.

854
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,749
Stay there on all fours. Yeah.

855
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:59,999
- You're hurting me?
- Do you like it?

856
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:03,957
Now you'll ask me to spank you,
like you've always done.

857
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:05,832
You like that?

858
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,790
Bitch, you're a real bitch.

859
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:12,082
You're hurting me.
Please, Pedro.

860
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:14,999
What are you complaining about?
What?

861
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:17,415
You chose to be a whore.

862
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,290
You'll do as I say,

863
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,749
in one way or another.

864
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:27,665
Tell me you like this.

865
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:34,499
No, please!

866
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,749
You like this?

867
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,249
I love you, Val.

868
01:22:24,416 --> 01:22:26,082
And you, what a view?

869
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:38,954
That night I understood, what grandma said,

870
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:40,915
prostitution and marriage
aren't that different.

871
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:43,915
You become the property of someone else.

872
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:47,457
And when they're like Jaime or Pedro,

873
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:49,999
your life has no value any longer.

874
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:24,457
I thought he would kill me.

875
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,165
There are many Pedros in this.

876
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,415
Go, you're still in time.

877
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:32,499
After, it's difficult to drop it.

878
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:37,624
You could go to Rio and give
my son an enormous kiss.

879
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,540
Now go home. You look tired.

880
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:44,957
I don't want to be alone.

881
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:48,082
Hi,

882
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:53,457
you've got a client, and
there aren't that many Pedros.

883
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:58,915
I'm sorry, I can't go.
I haven't slept for nights.

884
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,665
- And I have a date.
- I'll go.

885
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:04,874
You're going nowhere.
Who's the date with?

886
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:06,915
You're committed to me.

887
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:11,790
I'd go if I were you.
It's the Italian, your friend.

888
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:16,165
- Giovanni?
- Yes, and his friend.

889
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:21,374
Mae and you will go right now.
Cheers!

890
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:08,957
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.

891
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,124
Come on, princess.

892
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:22,790
I've finally convinced Giovanni,
the 'macaroni', that

893
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,499
you'd be mine tonight.

894
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,332
Come here, beautiful.
Come here.

895
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:43,040
You've said nothing since you're here.

896
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:51,082
What a pain of a whore!

897
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:56,582
I couldn't stop thinking about Giovanni.

898
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:59,040
I couldn't believe he didn't pick me.

899
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:02,207
I felt disgust while Alejandro fucked me.

900
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:05,790
Cindy was right saying
I should quit prostitution.

901
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,290
I could still do that.

902
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:11,540
But Cindy was trapped.

903
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:16,124
She owed Cris a lot of money,
and she was infatuated with her.

904
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:23,457
She couldn't stand not having her son.

905
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:43,707
What happened?

906
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:45,915
Cindy.

907
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:53,582
She foll out the window.
A suicide, we think.

908
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:57,124
She got a call. Seems like
her husband took the boy,

909
01:26:58,458 --> 01:27:00,040
but we know nothing more.

910
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:02,790
Cindy would never leave her son.

911
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,040
We buried her the next day,

912
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:21,124
just the girls from the brothel.

913
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,832
I was devastated.

914
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:28,082
I can't stop thinking about Cindy.

915
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,915
We're all sorry about Cindy,

916
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:38,082
but life goes on, and the job
that feeds you as well.

917
01:27:41,791 --> 01:27:42,999
I'm not going.

918
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,415
Yes you are, darling.

919
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,290
Hello?

920
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,957
Hello.

921
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:05,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

922
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:10,749
- I see they didn't tell you.
- That's okay.

923
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:12,790
- What's your name?
- Valerie.

924
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:15,165
I'm Inigo. Delighted.

925
01:28:19,416 --> 01:28:22,957
Could you pick me up and put me on the bed?

926
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,332
I could do that but

927
01:28:26,666 --> 01:28:28,790
it takes me a great effort.

928
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:40,957
Have no fear.
I feel absolutely nothing.

929
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:57,290
No, you don't need to undress me.

930
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,999
The only place I feel anything is my neck.

931
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,915
And my hands a bit.

932
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:40,665
- You smell nice.
- What do I smell of?

933
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:43,915
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate?

934
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,665
Could you do me a favour?

935
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:35,749
Move your fingers.
Come on, Valerie,

936
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:40,665
Move the fingers of your hand.
For you it's easy.

937
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:46,832
I am incapable of moving a single finger.

938
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:50,582
You don't know how many times, suddenly,

939
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,165
I imagine me hands and my
fingers start to move, and

940
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:59,290
I get up off the chair and I start to run.

941
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:01,790
I can tough the flowers,

942
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,915
feel the velvet,

943
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:08,124
and caress a woman as beautiful as you.

944
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:14,665
We should love ourselves more, Valerie.

945
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:21,999
Go, you're still in time.
After, it's difficult to drop it.

946
01:31:29,333 --> 01:31:32,582
Never give up anything you really long for

947
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,457
because you'll regret it.

948
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,040
Believe me.

949
01:31:41,791 --> 01:31:43,874
I know where you live.
I'll go get you.

950
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:49,707
Where are you going? Where, huh?

951
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:51,915
I don't care what you say, I'm gone.

952
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:54,165
I do care about what is said.

953
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:59,207
Clear out! Give me the bag!
You whore!

954
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:03,665
Go on, get out of my sight!

955
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,749
You're unbearable!

956
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:21,499
We always realize things
when it's too late.

957
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:23,540
Since the accident,

958
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,999
whenever I see anyone, I give them advice.

959
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:28,082
What advice?

960
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:33,207
To take advantage of their
life every day, but truly.

961
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:38,915
Live.

962
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,332
You need to be alone.

963
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:48,915
Enjoy life as much as you can.

964
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,290
And I can touch grass, feel velvet.

965
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,332
I slowly started to caress my body.

966
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,624
I had finally discovered
what road to follow.

967
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,707
That of being myself.

968
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:49,540
Although it was pouring rain,
I decided to go out.

969
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,415
I wanted to share that moment with
who'd always been by my side.

970
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,582
What are you doing here?

971
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:18,499
I know I'm unpresentable.

972
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:21,540
Congratulations!

973
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:24,540
- Are you okay?
- Better than ever.

974
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:27,540
I wanted to thank you.

975
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:29,124
For what?

976
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:33,124
For being my friend, for your advice.

977
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:36,665
I always follow your advice.

978
01:34:37,583 --> 01:34:39,582
I've decided to leave the brothel.

979
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,165
I'm so happy.

980
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:44,082
I'll spend some time with Hassan.

981
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:48,082
Won't you open your present?

982
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:53,040
It's beautiful!

983
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:54,790
It has no zipper.

984
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:57,957
Now I don't have that problem.
He helps me.

985
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:01,374
This is Marcos.
We met through an ad.

986
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:02,999
- Hi, Marcos.
- Hi.

987
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:06,040
- I'm glad for you.
- Come in and change.

988
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:09,957
- No, I have to go.
- What will you do now?

989
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,249
Live.

990
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:16,332
I'm a promiscuous woman, yes,

991
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:19,915
because I want to use
sex as a means to find

992
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:23,457
what everyone is looking for.
Recognition,

993
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:26,249
pleasure, self-esteem and, in short,

994
01:35:26,416 --> 01:35:29,540
love and affection.
What's pathological about that?

995
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:32,124
If you want to give me a name, go on,

996
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:33,915
I don't mind.

997
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:37,874
But you must know I'm really a mermaid,

998
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:43,665
a dryad, simply a nymph.

999
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

1000
01:36:47,916 --> 01:36:48,790
What?

1001
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,665
Get home?

1002
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:55,207
I want to fuck with you.

1003
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:03,624
I have no money.

1004
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,832
No matter. It's free.

1005
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:03,665
It's impossible for a man
who goes with whores

1006
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:05,540
to be loyal.

1007
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:06,624
Valerie...

1008
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,414
Live.
