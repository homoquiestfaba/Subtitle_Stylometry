1
01:14:55,622 --> 01:14:58,083
You're not doing as you're told.

2
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,336
The American is small and weak...

3
01:15:01,628 --> 01:15:03,004
Weak.

4
01:16:56,117 --> 01:16:57,369
How can you do this?

5
01:16:57,452 --> 01:16:59,454
He's nothing... soft!!

6
01:16:59,663 --> 01:17:03,041
He fights like a beast. How's my eye?

7
01:17:10,549 --> 01:17:11,883
He's not human...

8
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:23,061
He's like a piece of iron.

9
01:21:59,337 --> 01:22:02,465
You trained this fool. He's a disgrace.

10
01:22:03,258 --> 01:22:05,552
Listen to them...

11
01:22:05,635 --> 01:22:08,930
Our people cheer for HIM! ... You idiot.

12
01:22:09,306 --> 01:22:10,181
WIN!

13
01:22:16,354 --> 01:22:18,607
I fight to win!

14
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,070
For me!

15
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:30,660
For me!
