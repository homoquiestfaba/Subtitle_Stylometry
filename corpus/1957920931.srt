Getting there.

40
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:56,101
Wait, I thought you weren't going
into the office until later?

41
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:58,540
I'm not, but I'm meeting
my mom this morning

42
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,544
to look at bridesmaids'
dresses, remember?

43
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:02,147
Oh, that's right.

44
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:04,752
Well, I really wish I could
be there to help you, but...

45
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:06,623
Somebody has
a big callback today.

46
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:08,226
Yes, I do.

47
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:09,996
Please promise me
you're not gonna put me

48
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,267
in anything that'll scare
all the men away.

49
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:14,739
- What time's your audition?
- Ah, let's see.

50
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,810
It is at 2:00 PM today.

51
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:19,147
Which means I need
to catch the 12:30 bus.

52
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:21,887
Well, someday, you won't need
to commute from Jersey.

53
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,891
You'll be living
on the Upper-East Side.

54
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:25,995
If you listen closely enough,

55
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:29,168
I think you can hear my bank
account laughing its head off.

56
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:31,740
But you're going in now,
so early?

57
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:34,846
Yeah, I'm opening this morning
and closing tonight.

58
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:38,086
- That's a pretty long day.
- It's not so bad.

59
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,563
You sure you're gonna
be warm enough?

60
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,066
I gotta protect my voice.

61
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,670
Break a leg.

62
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:48,608
- Thank you. Bye!
- Bye.

63
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:13,323
Oh, they changed
my audition time?

64
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,602
Oh!
Excuse me.

65
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:22,642
Sorry!
Oh, no, I'm so late.

66
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,411
This is a disaster.

67
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,285
I'm so sorry. Let me help you.

68
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,329
Is there a person

69
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,999
under all this?

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,472
I really should get all these.

71
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:39,843
Yeah.

72
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,122
Yeah, well, I think that's uh...

73
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,061
I think that's most of them.

74
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,001
Yeah, well, most is not
good enough for my boss.

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,944
Chloe Bose.

76
00:03:58,313 --> 00:04:00,718
- Ah, Mrs. Berger.
- What are you doing?!

77
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,888
Why aren't you opening
the store!

78
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,259
Uh, I was on my way to the store

79
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,065
and I went to the distributor
and picked up the ornaments

80
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,403
like you asked me to do
and I bumped into this guy...

81
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:11,339
But it's after 9:00!

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,409
Yeah, technically,
it's my fault so...

83
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,081
You know what? I will open
the store. Just, just...

84
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:18,553
Just hurry up!
Okay, I will.

85
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:20,591
I'm really sorry.

86
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:22,895
She seems nice.

87
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,431
Here.

88
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,705
Oh, we should probably clean
them off a little bit.

89
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,676
- I think it's fine.
- Okay.

90
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:31,178
- I should really go.
- Okay.

91
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:33,049
- Like, right now.
- Okay. Bye.

92
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,387
- Bye.
- Stay warm.

93
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:49,682
Hi. We will be open
any minute,

94
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:54,357
okay, I'm just gonna go
unlock the door.

95
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:56,162
One minute.

96
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,470
Oh, I'm gonna have to count those,
I'm sure there's some missing.

97
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:03,442
I should take that out of your
pay. But I won't, I'm just...

98
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:05,915
I'm just disappointed.

99
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:12,628
- Hi, Jamal.
- Hey, Chloe.

100
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,999
What's going on?
She's not happy.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,137
Yeah, no. She's never happy.

102
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:20,076
I was walking down the street
and a guy bumped into me

103
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:23,015
and then I dropped this whole
basket of new ornaments.

104
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:25,320
Just a minor,
everyday catastrophe.

105
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:28,058

What's wrong,
Mrs. Berger?

121
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,260
Are the ornaments okay?

I mean, the customers
seem to like it.

125
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:28,445
Exactly. It's slowing
everything down.

126
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:31,786

- Hey.
- Oh, no, the audition.

156
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,267
What happened?

157
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:22,006
- The monologue was perfect.
- Mm.

158
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,877
- The song was even better.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,214
Then, they said
I wasn't tall enough.

160
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,985
- Oh.
- Can you believe it?

161
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:30,290
It was a callback,
they've already met me.

162
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,828
Have I shrunk since last week?

163
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:36,135
Oh, honey.
Next time, heels maybe?

164
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:39,308
I am wearing heels.

165
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,090
I'm going to be
in the Chorus forever.

166
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,894
Don't think that way.

167
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,633
It's gonna happen.
You're way too talented.

168
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:55,406
Santa's gonna deliver you a leading
role this year, I can just feel it.

169
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:56,776
I hope so.

170
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:59,682
This Christmas is my five-year
anniversary since moving here.

171
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:04,057
And the only role I ever booked
was that off, off...

172
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:07,397
off Broadway production
in a guy's basement.

173
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:10,103
And the only people that
showed up were his parents.

174
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,407
I meant to come
the second night.

175
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:14,680
There was no second night.

176
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,261
Merry Christmas.

177
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,865
- Hello.
- Hi.

178
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,301
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

179
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:28,205
I just have to close out
real quick.

180
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:30,076
How did dress shopping go?

181
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:32,080
We couldn't agree on anything.

182
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:34,451
She really liked
this purple frilly thing.

183
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,956
I said it looked
like a grape tutu.

184
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:38,827
She said I'm too picky.
So I said...

185
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,797
See, this is why I stay single.

186
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:44,572
It's just too much drama. But thank you
for not picking out something hideous.

187
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:48,278
You just haven't met
the right guy. Yet.

188
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,182
Let's go eat, I'm starving.
Okay, yeah.

189
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:52,654
Oh, no. Am I too late?

190
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:55,594
Uh, yeah. Sorry,
sir, we're closing.

191
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,698
Even for Santa?

192
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:00,269
Well, ho, ho, ho.

193
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,207
Well, that's my line, isn't it?

194
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:05,379
I was wondering if either
of you could help me?

195
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,155
I was in here earlier and had
a gift wrapped for my daughter.

196
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:11,526
She needs it
for school tomorrow.

197
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,264
Uh, yeah. For sure.
If you stop by tomorrow morning,

198
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:16,101
we can definitely help you.

199
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:18,238
When school's open,
you're still closed.

200
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,846
Oh, okay. Yeah, no worries.

201
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,650
I will look for it for you.

202
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:26,121
It's Christmas,
I can't say no to Santa.

203
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:27,991
Do you have your receipt,
Mr. Claus?

204
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:29,930
Bit of a problem there,
I can't find it.

205
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,300
Did one of your reindeer eat it?

206
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:34,572
Quite possibly.

207
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:37,443
Don't mind her, she's hungry.
What's the gift?

208
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:41,284
Oh, it was a paperweight that
said "World's Best Teacher".

209
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:43,021
Yeah, I know the one.

214
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:55,480
My daughter just loves
polar bears.

215
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:00,389
We have Christmas starry night.

216
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,561
- Hmm. Nope.
- Reindeer.

217
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,532
I mean, this looks like
the right size.

218
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,003
- Bears.
- What about cinnamon sticks?

219
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:09,207
- Bears?
- Okay.

220
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,211
Well, you know what?
Maybe it's in the back.

221
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,549
Okay.

222
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:19,227
Well, Mr. Cringle...

223
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,199
Call me, Chris.

224
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:24,972
If we're stuck here
on your account,

225
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:28,713
what I'd really like for
Christmas is a cashmere sweater,

226
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:31,418
a blue convertible
would be nice.

227
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,957
And oh, should I be sitting
on your lap for this?

228
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,699
No, it's not necessary.
I've got to get this off.

229
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:39,969
It's like a sauna in here,

230
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,338
I'm melting.

Will you excuse me
for a second? Thank you.

236
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:10,564
Thank you so much for helping.
This is uh...

237
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:13,503
What's your name?
I'm Chloe, what about you?

238
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:15,974
Jason. I'm Jason Murphy. Hi.

239
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,310
Oh, my gosh.

240
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:18,646
- What?
- It's you.

241
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,886
- What's me?
- The guy. From the street.

242
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,493
The one who ran into me, got me
in trouble with my boss.

243
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,598
Oh, that's you. Wow.
I don't recognize you

244
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:31,806
without the monstrous scarf
wrapped around your face. Wow.

245
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,477
You got in trouble for that?
Yeah. I sure did.

246
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:36,181
- I'm sorry, you know...
- It's okay.

247
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:39,889
I was running late and you know
Santa can't keep the kids waiting.

248
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,430
So instead, you mow down a lady
holding a basket full of holiday cheer?

249
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,303
That's naughty, Santa.

250
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:49,407
Hey, Chloe.
I'm gonna wait outside,

251
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:50,577
I have to make a phone call.

252
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:52,548
Please remember
your bestie is starving.

253
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:55,152
Okay, yeah.
No, I promise, one minute.

254
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,323
We'll find it.
You want me to help?

255
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:59,728
- Okay.
- Okey dokey. So...

256
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,599
Oh, hey.
What's the teacher's name?

257
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,237
Maybe it's written on the card.
It might be...

258
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:06,909
You know what?
Beasley, Miss Beasley.

259
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,514
Miss Beasley.

260
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:12,988
How much trouble did you get
into because of me?

261
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:16,529
Well, to be fair,
it's not all your fault.

262
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,434
I was late and I had
an audition afterwards.

263
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:22,641
- An audition?! Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

264
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:27,116
- So, you're an actor?
- I am, yeah. And a singer.

265
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:29,889
Wow, that's great.

266
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,861
So where you from?
I'm from Detroit.

267
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:35,700
I moved her five years ago
to make it on Broadway.

268
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:41,712
As one does. And here I am.
In New Jersey, in a gift shop.

269
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:43,816
Five years, hey. It's nothing.

270
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:46,756
Some people work half their life
to make it. So, yeah.

271
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:51,031
Thanks for the encouragement.

272
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:54,705
Oh, hey!
Christmas is saved.

273
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:58,948
Look at that. Well, at least
for my daughter it is.

274
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:03,322
Um, we should go.

275
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:05,159
Christine is probably
freaking out, out there.

276
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,896
Yeah, 'kay.

277
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:08,433
'Kay.

278
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:13,977
Oh, thank goodness.

279
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,314
I thought we'd still be here
till New Years.

280
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,951
Have I seen you in anything?

281
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,590
Uh, I've been in the Chorus
a few times.

282
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:24,765
- Uh-huh.
- And then I had one lead role

283
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:29,374
in this off, off, off Broadway
play, called Basement Serenade.

284
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,720
Which the director staged in his
mother's Staten Island basement.

285
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:38,726
Somehow, I must have missed
that one, sorry.

286
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:43,770
But I've heard you sing.
You're incredibly talented.

287
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:46,943
Oh, you're just saying that
'cause you got me in trouble.

288
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:49,080
No, I'm actually not.

289
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:52,822
I'm giving you my...
professional opinion.

290
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,527
Wait, your professional opinion?

291
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,229
- Yeah.
- Are you in the business?

292
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,602
- Mm-hmm.
- Director, producer?

293
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:02,875
- Jingle writer.
- Jingle writer?

294
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:06,414
Okay, interesting.
So jingle writer by day,

295
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:09,955
Santa by night.
Yes, Santa has just always

296
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,759
been a thing for me.

297
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,533
I grew up in this neighbourhood
and loved going to visit Santa.

298
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:18,205
And now it's my turn.
It's a bit of a give back,

299
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:21,613
but it also really gets me into
the holiday spirit, so.

300
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:25,653
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

301
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:28,827
Well, it was really nice
meeting you, Santa.

302
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,998
Or, Jason.

303
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,610
What?

304
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:38,245
What?

305
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:43,355
I would love to invite you
to have coffee or something.

306
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:46,796
With me, so I can
make it up to you.

307
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,533
Oh, um...

308
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:51,371
Yeah. Do you want to help me
take this in?

309
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:53,408
- Yeah.
- Hi.

310
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:58,385
Oh. Hi. Um, I'm sorry we're
actually closed for the night.

311
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:59,822
No, I'm not here to shop.

312
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:03,629
I actually came here
with a proposition.

313
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,836
- A proposition?
- Yes.

314
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:10,577
I would love for you two
to come to my office tomorrow.

315
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,547
Both of you.

316
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:14,251
8:00 in the morning.

317
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:18,091
Uh. 8:00 AM?

318
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:22,066
Uh, yeah. That's before
the store opens,

319
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,404
so I guess that works for me.
Does that work for you?

320
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:28,178
The timing works, but what is
this... what is this about?

321
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,681
What's your name, young man?

322
00:16:29,682 --> 00:16:32,822
Jason. Jason Murphy.

323
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,127
I'm Chloe. Chloe Bose.

324
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,231
Jason and Chloe.

325
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,302
Murphy and Bose.

326
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:42,340
You make a beautiful couple.

327
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:47,416
You have a nice rhythm together.
That's wonderful.

328
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,156
I'm looking forward
to seeing you again.

329
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:53,095
I think you'll be
quite interested

330
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,934
in what I have to say.

331
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:57,304
Goodnight.

332
00:16:57,905 --> 00:17:00,778
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

333
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:04,151
Who was that?

334
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:06,288
Cora Lawson.

335
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:11,666
I feel like I should know her,
like she's somebody.

336
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,091
This is so wild.

337
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,829
- Hey!
- Hi.

338
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,467
Come on in. Chloe, Jason,

339
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:33,009
thank you so much
for coming so early.

340
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,047
Hi.

341
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:39,020
These are great. Look at all
these great photographs.

342
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:40,055
Yeah.

343
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:42,059
- Is that...
- It's the barbershop.

344
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,633
Is it? It's Jackson's
Barbershop. And is that...

345
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:47,303
Is it the old Five and Dime?

346
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,472
You grew up here.

347
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:50,275
Yeah. Born and raised.

348
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:51,946
That is wonderful.

349
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,818
There's so much history
in this neighbourhood.

350
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:56,856
Especially during the holidays.

351
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:59,661
This place used to be
pure magic.

352
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,999
Used to be? It still is.

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,339
This is gonna be my fifth Christmas
here and it just never gets old.

354
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,142
- Yeah.
- Turning Main Street

355
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:09,982
into Holiday Lane
has been a tradition

356
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:13,422
in this neighbourhood
for close to 100 years.

357
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:18,298
There would be special events
during the whole holiday season.

358
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,974
But that stopped a few years ago
when the crowds started

359
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:27,349
getting smaller,
today smaller still.

360
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,754
Oh, that's so sad.

361
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:33,395
It's more than sad.
It's hurting the community.

362
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:38,873
The holidays used to bring
everyone together here.

363
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:41,411
Now a lot of stores
are struggling.

364
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:45,587
I've already lost two of my best
tenants this year.

365
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,358
- Tenants?
- I inherited a few

366
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,897
of the buildings
on Holiday Lane.

367
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:54,003
My great-grandparents started
the whole tradition

368
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:57,076
of renaming the street
for the season.

369
00:18:57,077 --> 00:18:59,313
So that's why I always
see you around,

370
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:00,917
but you never buy anything.

371
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:03,421
Wait, do you own the gift shop?

372
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,025
Only the building.

373
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:08,900
But I like to keep
an eye on things.

374
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:11,070
I remember when our customers

375
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:15,345
used to line up
and down the sidewalks.

376
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:18,051
We were a Christmas destination.

377
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:21,927
Which brings me to you two.

378
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,531
Us?!

379
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,602
- What?
- I think you can help me

380
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:29,073
bring that holiday magic back.

381
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:33,883
Chloe, your voice
is spectacular.

382
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:37,892
- Thank you.
- It really is incredible.

383
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,134
But what can I, what can I do?

384
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:46,341
A lot. Last night,
I checked out your website.

385
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:52,587

or you're out of air ♪

Yeah, wow. You really
went to my website.

389
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,012
Wait, that's you?

390
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,649
- Yeah.
- I hear that on TV

391
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,489
all the time.
He's got the magic in him too.

392
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,129
Your jingles are fabulous.

393
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:16,367
Oh... Thank you. Um.

394
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:19,240
So, you want us to what?

395
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:21,979
Bring the Christmas Show
back to Holiday Lane?

396
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,718
Yes, exactly.

397
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:26,487
Absolutley.

398
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:29,561
And make it a big extravaganza.

399
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,732
Just like it used to be.

400
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,741
Jason, maybe you can write
an original song.

401
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:42,319
Chloe. You, of course, will
sing like the angel you are.

402
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,861
Yeah, that's so nice.

403
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,734
Is there a problem?

404
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:52,741
Uh, no. It's just,
it's two weeks until Christmas

405
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:55,913
and I have a lot
of auditions coming up.

406
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:59,353
And my boss is already mad at me
for skipping out on work

407
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:02,894
and taking so much time off.
So, I don't know how,

408
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,998
how I could do it.

409
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:09,340
Chloe. You're young
and you're ambitious.

410
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,010
That's not a crime.

411
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:14,751
But if something changes,
let me know.

412
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:17,257
My door is always open.

413
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,260

Here you are. Merry Christmas.

421
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:49,921
What happened? Did they think
you were too short again?

422
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,992
No, too tall.

423
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:53,428
Did they notice
you're wearing heels?

424
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:55,600
Yeah, it didn't matter.

425
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,737
The usual.
Thank you.

426
00:21:57,738 --> 00:22:01,310
Cheer up. You just have
to keep at it.

427
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,148
All it takes
is one audition, right?

428
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:05,485
How many more do you have
before Christmas?

429
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:06,722
Three.

430
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:08,793
That's three more chances

431
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,831
for someone to notice
how awesome you are.

432
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,370
Hey, do you mind if I sneak
out the back?

433
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:18,411
The back alley is way faster
and I am late, as usual.

434
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:20,049
Help yourself.

435
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,893
- Hey.
- Hi.

436
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:28,532
- Christine.
- Yeah. How can I help you?

437
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:32,307
Does Santa need a facial?
Fake beards can be an irritant.

438
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,314
No, I...

439
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:40,790
I um, actually just want to talk
to you for a minute if I can.

440
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,297
- Mm-hmm.
- It's... It's about Chloe.

441
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,103
Oh.

442
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:53,281
Is this really necessary?

443
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:56,487
My boss has to think you're
a customer. Those are the rules.

444
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:58,191
Okay.

445
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,494
Wow.

446
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:02,801
Oh boy, what's that?

447
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:05,541
Don't worry, I'm a professional.

448
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:10,516
Oooh, it's cold. It's chilly.

449
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:14,191
Yeah. You said you wanted
to talk to me about Chloe?

450
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:17,630
Yeah. Yes, I wanted
to ask you,

451
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:22,808
I mean, it's a bit awkward,
but what's her situation?

452
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:25,980
As in, does she have
a boyfriend?

453
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:29,354
Yeah, that.

454
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:32,326
First, let's talk about
your situation.

455
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,165
I understand
you have a daughter?

456
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,135
Oh, yes, I do.
I have a daughter.

457
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:41,945
And Angela, her mother and I have
been happily divorced for three years.

458
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:46,488
She's got a new marriage and a new
baby and we get along really great.

459
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,060
That was a good answer.

460
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,465
Is she single?

461
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,472
Yes. But it doesn't
necessarily mean

462
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:56,708
she's single for you.

463
00:23:56,709 --> 00:24:00,783
What's wrong with me?
Do you not think she likes me?

464
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,854
It's not that.

465
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:06,662
It's just,
Chloe is quite particular.

466
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,264
Particular how?

467
00:24:08,265 --> 00:24:11,905
Particular in that I don't
want anyone to hurt her

468
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:13,341
the way the last guy did.

469
00:24:13,342 --> 00:24:16,113
And I'm not so sure someone
with a kid is the right way

470
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:18,384
to be jumping back
into the dating pool.

471
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:21,357
Okay, well, I'm particular
too because I have a kid.

472
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:23,428
I just can't be letting
anyone into my life.

473
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,268
Whoa, Chloe is not just anyone.

474
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:29,841
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you about this.

475
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:31,143
Go on.

476
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:33,047
Chloe told you about
the Christmas Show, right?

477
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:34,283
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

478
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:36,153
Well, I was hoping
she would do it

479
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:38,692
so we would get to know
each other a little bit.

480
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:41,230
It's a nice idea, friend,
but I'm sad to say,

481
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,101
she doesn't really
have the time.

482
00:24:43,102 --> 00:24:46,408
She's auditioning a lot.
Broadway is her dream.

483
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:49,246
She's just so talented.

484
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:51,385
She just needs
the right audience.

485
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,464
Wait.

486
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:02,005
Wait, wait, wait. If she sings
at the Christmas Show,

487
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:04,043
then she will have
that audience, right?

488
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,447
And she'll be a lead singer
which she really needs

489
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:08,986
people to see her as.
Hmm.

490
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,023
And so many people who live
around here

491
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:13,094
actually work in the city.
That's right.

492
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,365
Yeah, someone with
the right connections

493
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,302
might notice how amazing she is.

494
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:19,273
Plus, it will give her
some confidence.

495
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:20,843
- That's right.
- Right, yeah!

496
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:22,479
We have to get her
to do the show.

497
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,882
- Yes.
- Yes.

498
00:25:23,883 --> 00:25:26,421
Let's do it.

499
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:36,007
I can't believe
so many amazing people

500
00:25:36,008 --> 00:25:38,478
are signing up for this.
Yeah.

501
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,850
I told you, there's a lot
of talented people

502
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:42,820
in this community.
There is.

503
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:44,724
- Yes.
- Merry Christmas.

504
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:49,033
Hello, Chloe. We were
hoping you would be here.

505
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:51,404
- You were?
- Listen, would you mind

506
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:54,009
putting some of these up?
I don't know if your boss

507
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,345
would mind, but look at this.

508
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,282
I'm sure she won't.

509
00:25:57,283 --> 00:26:00,121
I think she even secretly wants
to be a part of the show.

510
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:01,725
Seriously?

511
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,096
What does she do?

512
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:06,702
I don't know. Is firing
people a special talent?

513
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:09,975
Listen, I'm not sure
that's the right kind

514
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:12,747
of Christmas spirit, though.

515
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:14,450
Well, here, you take these.

516
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:16,688
Thank you so much
for all your help.

517
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:17,690
Yeah.

518
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:20,495
Oh, so it's really
coming together, huh?

519
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:24,571
Yes. Everybody's very excited.

520
00:26:24,572 --> 00:26:25,873
That's wonderful.

521
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:29,413
But why can't you be part
of it, Chloe? Seriously.

522
00:26:29,414 --> 00:26:33,522
I told you. I...
I have auditions.

523
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:37,262
I've been thinking. We can
work around your schedule,

524
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:41,538
so you can do the show
and get to your auditions too.

525
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,613
After all, hearing you sing
is what inspired me

526
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:50,289
to bring the show back
in the first place.

527
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:55,198
I so appreciate that,
Ms. Lawson.

528
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,467
In case you haven't noticed,

529
00:26:56,468 --> 00:26:58,204
we would really love
to have you.

530
00:26:58,205 --> 00:26:59,875
Yes, we would.

531
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,020
Okay. I'll...
I'll think about it.

532
00:27:06,021 --> 00:27:07,623
Yes.

533
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:08,859
Chloe.

534
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,365
Oh, uh, Mrs. Berger,
I'm sorry, they were just um...

535
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,002
- Ms. Lawson.
- Yes.

536
00:27:14,003 --> 00:27:16,641
You're producing the Christmas
Show, isn't that right?

537
00:27:16,642 --> 00:27:18,244
Yes, I am.

538
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:21,450
Well, I have you know
that I took tap dance lessons.

539
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:22,721
Really?

540
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:26,595
So, you're spending Christmas
Eve with Byron's family?

541
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:29,433
Uh-huh. And Christmas Day
with my folks.

542
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:32,005
Looks like it's just gonna be
me and the tree then.

543
00:27:32,006 --> 00:27:34,176
Oh, hey. I totally forgot
to ask.

544
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:36,046
What do you want
for Christmas this year?

545
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:38,251
Peace and goodwill
for humankind.

546
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:39,988
And maybe some cute earrings.

547
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:40,990
You?

548
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:42,426
I mean, I think you already

549
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,329
know the answer to that.

550
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,434
A lead role in a show.

551
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:48,573
This is my last chance.

552
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:51,310
Are you moving to Mars
and you forgot to tell me?

553
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:53,616
No. Not Mars.

554
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:56,455
Detroit.

555
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,326
- What?!
- I made a promise to myself

556
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:03,302
that I wasn't going to spend forever
chasing after something I would never get.

557
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,340
So, when I moved here,
I gave myself five years.

558
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:09,446
And those five years are up
at the end of the month.

559
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:10,583
But you could just...

560
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:12,152
If these auditions
don't pan out,

561
00:28:12,153 --> 00:28:14,223
it is back to Detroit
and dental school.

562
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:16,060
Just like my dad predicted.

563
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,264
Your dad the dentist?

564
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:22,608
He's always wanted me to take over
his practice after he retires.

565
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:25,346
You never told me any of this.

566
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:28,484
This thing isn't working.

567
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:31,725
Oh, here.
Maybe this one's loose.

568
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:34,429
Yeah, I guess I just didn't
want to deal with it.

569
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,102
But I don't know, maybe this
is the universe's way

570
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:39,507
of telling me it's time
to give up.

571
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:41,678
What are you talking about?

572
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,447
You're getting married
in three months

573
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:46,622
and there is no way I can afford
this place by myself.

574
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:48,926
Oh, honey.

575
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,399
Which is why I'm going to have
to pour all of my energy

576
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,004
into these auditions
and blow them away.

577
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:57,610
But he likes you.

578
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,012
What? Who?

579
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:01,586
That guy. Jason.

580
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:04,289
He came to the spa
and he asked about you.

581
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,530
And he's divorced.
And he's nice.

582
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:11,538
And I don't know if you noticed,
but he's kind of gorgeous.

583
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:14,076
I definitely noticed.

584
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:15,345
Right?

585
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:17,482
And I thought about him too.

586
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:20,089
- Mm-hmm.
- More than once.

587
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:22,593
But I don't know.
Starting something

588
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,567
with a new guy when I might be
leaving town for good.

589
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:30,342
That is as simple as trying
to get this tree to light up.

590
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:36,454
Huh.

591
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:39,359
If I get these lights to work,

592
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,798
you have to have dinner
with Jason.

593
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:44,369
Uh, okay.

594
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,043
You have yourself a deal.

595
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,434
Ta-dah!

596
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:09,353
Oh, that's so flattering.

597
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:11,892
So, you're basically here
because you lost a bet.

598
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:16,333
No. No, it's not like that.

599
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:19,641
It's just really,
really bad timing.

600
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:22,647
Is it my situation?
Because my ex-wife,

601
00:30:22,648 --> 00:30:25,018
her husband and the baby,
they live a few blocks away.

602
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,521
Angela bounces back and forth

603
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:28,860
and we all get along
really well.

604
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,497
That sounds perfect.

605
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,135
- Yeah.
- For a kid.

606
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,206
Okay, I need to just say it.

607
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:37,543
I don't want to make
this weird, but...

608
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:41,284
- What?
- This isn't a date.

609
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:45,291
No. This is not a date.
And that's a good thing.

610
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:47,930
Okay, good.
We're on the same page.

611
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,703
Like I told your friend.
I need to get to know somebody

612
00:30:50,704 --> 00:30:53,474
first and get to know them well
before I let them into my life.

613
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:55,411
Especially meeting Angela.

614
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:58,384
It's a big deal for me,
actually. No, not a date.

615
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,054
Not a date.

616
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:02,861
So, is this like
a job interview?

617
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,430
No.

618
00:31:06,602 --> 00:31:09,807
No.
No, well, even if it were,

619
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:12,748
I don't think I would get
the job.

620
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,553
You sure about that?

621
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,724
The thing is...

622
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:23,935
If I don't book
one of these auditions,

623
00:31:23,936 --> 00:31:27,176
I'm moving back to Detroit
after New Years.

624
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:32,888
And I just want
to be straight with you.

625
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:38,999
Okay.

626
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,335
Alright.

627
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:42,205
Well, let me be straight
with you.

628
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:45,446
I know this isn't a date, but...

629
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:48,185
I like you.

630
00:31:51,324 --> 00:31:53,227
I feel like I'm six.

631
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,532
I feel like
I'm six years old too.

632
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,904
Because...

633
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:01,645
I like you too.

634
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:04,851
Okay. Now we're getting somewhere.

635
00:32:04,852 --> 00:32:08,224
No. No, we're not.
I just told you.

636
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:12,968
Just say yes. Do the show
and go out with a bang.

637
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:15,371
You can sing
whatever song you want.

638
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:16,641
I'll make sure of that.

639
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:19,179
See, Cora's made me
music director,

640
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,017
so you can just choose.

641
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:25,092
You are not what I expected.

642
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,769
I will think about it.

643
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,073
Okay.

644
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:52,581

645
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,561

653
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:02,954
That was beautiful.

654
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:08,464
But unfortunately,
we're really looking

655
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:11,705
for someone just a little older.

656
00:34:17,517 --> 00:34:20,254
Well, at least they didn't say
they wanted someone younger.

657
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:22,660
No, they didn't.
But at the other audition,

658
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:25,065
on the other side of town,
mind you, they did.

659
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,538
How do you deal with this?

660
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,007
Chocolate.

661
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:31,945
I'm gonna order another brownie,
do you want some?

662
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,915
Oh, I've already got
a sugar rush so strong

663
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,652
I'm not gonna be eating
for a week.

664
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,990
Yeah. I guess I should
probably stop too.

665
00:34:37,991 --> 00:34:40,395
A dentist shouldn't rot
her own teeth.

666
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:44,670
Hey, are you okay?

667
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:48,745
Yeah. It's just after
today's two auditions,

668
00:34:48,746 --> 00:34:51,483
I have one last chance
to make it.

669
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:54,924
And if I don't,
it wasn't meant to be.

670
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:57,831
If it wasn't meant to be,
that's...

671
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,837
That has to be okay.

672
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,141
It has to.

673
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:05,847
Yeah.

674
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:09,420
Don't give up yet. Okay?

675
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:14,462
Would you mind putting
some of these up?

676
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:17,236
Here you go. Thank you.

677
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:22,713
- Hi.
- Hello, Chloe.

678
00:35:22,714 --> 00:35:25,318
Christine, is it?
Good memory.

679
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:29,894
I know your schedule is packed,
but I desperately need a favour.

680
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:33,033
If you're not too busy.

681
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:36,875
Oh, no, I'm just busy drowning
my sorrows in calories.

682
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:40,249
- Rough audition?
- Two, in fact.

683
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:45,024
Turns out I'm too old,
too young, too tall, too short.

684
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:50,301
That's not true. Well, you
seem to be just right to me.

685
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:52,740
Oh, well, I appreciate that.

686
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:54,142
So, what do you need done?

687
00:35:54,143 --> 00:35:57,883
I'd love for you
to pick something up for me

688
00:35:57,884 --> 00:36:02,026
at this address.
It's a little sensitive.

689
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:06,668
- Sensitive?
- I would go myself,

690
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:10,709
but it's a walk-up
and my knees don't get along

691
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,850
too well with stairs these days.
Mm-mmm, not for me.

692
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,888
Okay, yeah.

693
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:21,364
I can totally go for you.
You can?! Oh, thanks, Chloe.

694
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:25,907
Of course. Oh, and what am I
supposed to do with it when I get it?

695
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:27,844
You'll know.

696
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:19,447
I guess this is it.

697
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,665
We've been expecting you.

698
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,235
Come in.

699
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:35,077
Wow, do you live here
or work here?

700
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:37,015
Well, a little bit of both.

701
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:40,321
This is my studio
and it's also my home.

702
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:41,991
Hey! It's our home.

703
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:44,362
Whoa, excuse me.
Yes, it's our home.

704
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:46,133
Turkey.

705
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:48,538
This is my daughter. Angela,
this is my friend, Chloe.

706
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:49,674
Nice to meet you.

707
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,410
It's nice to meet you too, Angela.

708
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:53,748
So, are you also a musician?

709
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:56,153
Ah, yeah. I guess
you could say that.

710
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:59,694
I sing and I act and I dance
a little too.

711
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,329
Whoa, a real triple threat.

712
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,570
- Somebody knows their Broadway.
- Yeah, that's my girl.

713
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:06,106
So, what about you?

714
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:07,943
Do you want to sing
when you're older?

715
00:38:07,944 --> 00:38:09,747
No. I think I'm going
into law.

716
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,217
I need a more stable lifestyle.

717
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:15,224
Oh, that's me.

718
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:18,431
Oh, it's your mom,
she's downstairs.

719
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:22,773
Where you going? Get back here.

720
00:38:22,774 --> 00:38:24,409
Nice to meet you, Chloe.

721
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,647
- It's nice to meet you too.
- I love you.

722
00:38:26,648 --> 00:38:27,984
I love you.

723
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:31,423
Okay, well, she is adorable.

724
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:36,602
Yeah. She is. Bit of a handful
at times, but in the best way.

725
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:41,243
Uh, so, Ms. Cora said that
you have something for her?

726
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:44,482
Oh. Is that how she put it?

727
00:38:44,483 --> 00:38:47,189
What?

728
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:48,958
What is going on?

729
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,029
I wrote a song

730
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,203
and Cora thought that
you might want to hear it.

731
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:57,075
- For the show?
- Yeah.

732
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:58,444
But I'm not in the show.

733
00:38:58,445 --> 00:39:03,188
Oh, that's too bad

- It's really, really good.

- I do, I love it.

746
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:07,215
Good because it felt so good
to write it.

747
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:09,620
To write something that's longer
than 30 seconds.

748
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:13,060
I mean, you wrote a whole new
Christmas song.

749
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:16,066
You're like, Mariah Carey.

750
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,872
I'd need a little more glitter
for that, but thank you.

751
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:20,842
But uh, I mean,

752
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:26,053
not to be negative or anything,
we have a real problem.

753
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:28,958
Oh. Okay, what is it?

754
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,897
Give to me. Out with it,
I can handle it.

755
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:35,137
Your song isn't exactly
in my key.

756
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:38,377
Oh, that's... that's easy.

757
00:40:38,378 --> 00:40:40,582
I just heard you singing in the
shop and I took a wild guess.

758
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,053
We can just transpose it.
It's a piece of cake.

759
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:45,158
Wait a minute.

760
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:48,965
You said, "We have a problem."

761
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:52,206
Does that mean that
you're doing the show?

762
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:55,745
Seriously?! Really?

763
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:57,516
How can I say no now?

764
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,920
I guess we're just gonna have
to call Ms. Cora Lawson

765
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,557
and tell her that
her genius plan worked.

766
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:06,334
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

767
00:41:08,906 --> 00:41:12,078
Are you sure you don't want one?
I mean, they look delicious.

768
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,882
- They are, they are delicious.
- I'm good.

769
00:41:13,883 --> 00:41:15,552
- Yeah? OK.
- Yeah.

770
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:17,154
Just one. Just one.

771
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:20,629
Can I just say,
I'm obsessed with your song.

772
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,033
It's like a real song.

773
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:27,943
I prefer to write a real song,

774
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,382
but jingles, you know,
jingles pay the bills.

Are you always this happy?

778
00:41:41,605 --> 00:41:44,242
I mean, yeah.

779
00:41:44,243 --> 00:41:49,186
But I'm extra happy because
of you... and your song.

780
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:52,091
It's just making
everything easier.

781
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:56,867
- Easier to do the show or...
- No. Easier to let go.

782
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:58,470
Let go of what?

783
00:41:58,471 --> 00:42:01,443
The stress of trying
to make it on Broadway.

784
00:42:01,444 --> 00:42:05,250
I've made up my mind and
my little experiment is done,

785
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:08,759
and honestly, I feel...
I feel a relief.

786
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,098
Do you really have to leave?

787
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:14,035
Your whole life is here.
Everything is here.

788
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:16,874
Well, I'm here.

789
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,545
Trust me. I know.

790
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,617
Yeah, I think my time's up.

791
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:25,725
But I'm going out
with a great song in my heart.

792
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:27,095

00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:27,783
Chloe.

806
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:30,822
Decided to visit us show folks?

807
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:33,895
I decided to stay. I'm in.

808
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:35,465
Yes.

809
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:40,074
All right, all right.
Somehow, I kinda knew.

810
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,746
Because you made it happen?

811
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:45,719
So, I guess you liked
Jason's song?

812
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,324
I love his song.

813
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:02,754
Just those two items
for you? Great.

814
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,600
- Hey.
- Hi.

815
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:11,302
We should get going.
Rehearsal time.

816
00:44:11,303 --> 00:44:13,140
I don't think I can.
Look at the line.

817
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:15,578

gift-wrapped?

818
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:18,551
Chloe, we need to rehearse.

819
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:21,423
I know, but Jamal's out sick

how to wrap Christma gifts?

what's going on?

Chloe, can you do me
a big favour?

847
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:32,833
Um... Sure, yeah. What's up?

848

You can call me Greta.

It's weird, I keep getting
these incoming calls

883
00:47:51,945 --> 00:47:54,248
from an unknown number.
It's probably spam.

884
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:56,252
You should probably take it.

897
00:48:24,744 --> 00:48:26,647

00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:37,535
Uh, yeah, I did. But I was
too short or too something.

901
00:48:37,536 --> 00:48:40,541
Well, I watched
your audition video, and to me,

902
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,645
you're too good to pass up.

903

Um, I'll get in touch as soon
as I know when.

Yeah, from the heart. Yeah.

00:50:38,612 --> 00:50:43,453
What's funny is that I think
it's actually less

941
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:47,629
about where it comes from
and more about,

942
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,368
for sure, where it's going.

943
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:55,545

always said that good singers

Great singers perform for
something greater than us all.

946
00:51:05,031 --> 00:51:11,644
They sing the song through
the audience on its way up.

947
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:15,084

That's stage right.

957
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:11,162
And we call the offstage area
the wing.

958
00:52:11,163 --> 00:52:14,435
- Why?
- Well, because in the old days,

959
00:52:14,436 --> 00:52:19,947
they stored big pieces of scenery
there called "wing flats".

960
00:52:21,784 --> 00:52:24,088
It's crazy. For being
a real estate mogul,

961
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:26,092
she sure knows a lot
about the theatre.

962
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:30,066
Yeah. Our Ms. Cora is quite
the mystery, isn't she?

963
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:31,403
She is.

964
00:52:33,642 --> 00:52:35,611
It's wild to think,

965
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:38,951
we are gonna be up there
tomorrow night.

966
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:40,121
Us.

967
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:42,625

00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,230
Yeah, yeah. Yup.

969
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:45,966
Yeah.

970
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:50,273
So, speaking of... us.

971
00:52:50,274 --> 00:52:52,045
I...
Mmhmm.

972
00:52:57,756 --> 00:52:59,391
Tell me. What?
Okay.

973
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:03,534
So, tomorrow, Angela's gonna
be at her mom's in the morning.

974
00:53:03,535 --> 00:53:06,840
And I was wondering if maybe,
you know, tomorrow night,

975
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:08,812
you wanted to have...

976
00:53:09,914 --> 00:53:13,019
a dinner. Um.
Oh.

977
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,221
With me.

978
00:53:14,222 --> 00:53:15,457
If you have time.

979
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,932
Like to celebrate, you know,
your audition and...

980
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:22,839
Like an actual date?

981
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,010
Yeah. It could be.

982
00:53:25,011 --> 00:53:27,382
It could be.

983
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:34,428
I really like the sound of
that. And... I really like you.

984
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:36,233
I just don't know...

985
00:53:36,768 --> 00:53:38,837
I don't know.
I don't know anything.

986
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:40,340
I don't know what's gonna
happen, I don't know

987
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:42,613
if I'm gonna get the part
and I just...

988
00:53:43,347 --> 00:53:47,956
I also don't know what the means
for my life and us and...

989
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,431
So, I think it might be best
that we don't start anything

990
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:53,535
at this time.

991
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,273
Especially with...

992
00:53:57,208 --> 00:54:00,046
Yeah. Yeah, right. Of course,

993
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:02,184
with Angela in the picture,
and yeah. No, you're right,

994
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:06,460
the timing is... the timing
is off a bit, yeah.

995
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:11,470
Mm-hmm.
Okay, yeah.

996
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:16,546
You turned him down?

997
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,817
Why on earth would you turn
a man like that down?

998
00:54:18,818 --> 00:54:20,086
You know you like him.

999
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:22,925
He's everything I would ever
want in a guy.

1000
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,896
So then why not go out with him?

1001
00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:27,034
Because it's just a callback.

1002
00:54:27,035 --> 00:54:28,436
I don't have the part yet

1003
00:54:28,437 --> 00:54:30,608
and I'm most likely moving
back to Detroit.

1004
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:34,014
Ah, ah-ah. Nope. I forbid it.

1005
00:54:34,015 --> 00:54:36,586
Okay, let's say

1006
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:38,489
I do get the part. Then what?

1007
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,195
I am a lead in my first
Broadway production.

1008
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:43,801
And I'm gonna be way too busy
for a relationship.

1009
00:54:43,802 --> 00:54:48,611
And... it's a huge responsibility.

1010
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:55,357
Or maybe you're just afraid
to get your heart broken again.

1011

Well, Mom texted.
She can't come get me,

1024

1028
00:55:58,217 --> 00:56:01,790

00:56:18,825 --> 00:56:21,028
there's no babysitters
that are in town.

Dad, I don't
really need a babysitter.

00:56:32,251 --> 00:56:34,221
Well, I'm sure there's someone.

1040
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:36,594
This last minute,
it's not looking so good.

1041
00:56:38,765 --> 00:56:41,570
- I could watch her.
- Really?!

1042
00:56:41,571 --> 00:56:42,972
I think that's a great idea.

1043
00:56:42,973 --> 00:56:45,812
Slow down, Jellybean.
I, uh...

1044
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:49,552
Don't you have to work?
No, I'm closing tonight.

1045
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:52,758
Right but it's Christmas,
right? You gotta wrap presents

1046
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:54,394
or go shopping...

1047
00:56:54,395 --> 00:56:57,167
Well, Christine and I were
actually supposed to have lunch,

1048
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:59,104
and then there was some
spa treatment emergency,

1049
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:02,011
so I have a few hours.
Yes!

1050
00:57:04,182 --> 00:57:07,187
Any chance you guys have
a cookie cutter some place?

1051
00:57:07,188 --> 00:57:09,926
My dad's not exactly
what you'd call a baker.

1052
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:11,630
Me neither.

1053
00:57:11,631 --> 00:57:13,432
But this is really simple.

1054
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:15,938
Yeah. But once I had
to explain...

1055
00:57:15,939 --> 00:57:17,508
the toaster.

1056
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:20,414
Let's just say all the gourmet
meals are at my mom's place.

1057
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:24,321
Okay, so what do you think?

1058
00:57:24,322 --> 00:57:26,358
Christmas balls, two sizes?

1059
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,763
Perfect.

1060
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:34,341
So, your dad doesn't
like cooking. What does he like?

1061
00:57:34,342 --> 00:57:37,415
Um, well, I think he likes you.

1062
00:57:39,285 --> 00:57:41,823
- What's that?
- I said he likes you.

1063
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:44,630
Me? Oh, well.

1064
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:49,104
I like him too.
I knew you liked him,

1065
00:57:49,105 --> 00:57:51,309
but do you like him, like him?

1066
00:57:52,713 --> 00:57:55,551
Uh, it's a little complicated.

1067
00:57:55,552 --> 00:58:01,062
- Oh. Is it because of me?
- What?! No! No, not at all.

1068
00:58:02,298 --> 00:58:04,936
The thing is,
is I might be moving back home

1069
00:58:04,937 --> 00:58:07,842
to where I grew up.
Where's that?

1070
00:58:07,843 --> 00:58:09,278
Detroit.

1071
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,717
Well, I hope you don't
have to go.

1072
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:14,690
Me too.

1073
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,195
But hey, if I do,

1074
00:58:18,196 --> 00:58:20,602
we can still be friends, okay?

1075
00:58:24,677 --> 00:58:26,780
Great.

1076
00:58:26,781 --> 00:58:29,586
And you and my dad get to be
in the show together

1077
00:58:29,587 --> 00:58:32,091
tomorrow night.
Best Christmas ever!

1078
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:37,803
Oh, I bet that's my dad
checking in. He's so cute.

1079
00:58:57,542 --> 00:59:01,215
Such a beautiful night,
though, for this. I'm loving it.

1080
00:59:01,216 --> 00:59:03,452
Oh, hey.

1081
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:05,189
Merry Christmas,
good to see you.

1082
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,027
You too, nice to see you.

1083
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:10,701
Oh, I bought that one
for Byron's dad.

1084
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:14,342
What do you think? Is it too
much for a future father-in-law?

1085
00:59:16,046 --> 00:59:17,548
Oh.
The sweater.

1086
00:59:17,549 --> 00:59:21,288
Oh, yeah, I mean, Byron,
he's gonna love it.

1087
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:25,196
Good to know.
Since I bought it for his dad.

1088
00:59:25,197 --> 00:59:27,367
What's going on with you?

1089
00:59:27,368 --> 00:59:30,273
Sorry, I'm just waiting for...

1090
00:59:30,274 --> 00:59:32,645
For this call, right here.

1091
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:34,247
Hello?

1092
00:59:34,248 --> 00:59:36,687
Uh, yeah, this is her speaking.

1093
00:59:38,256 --> 00:59:42,298
Ah, it's the only time
they can see me, okay.

1094
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:45,537
No, no, no. It's good.

1095
00:59:45,538 --> 00:59:49,680
Yeah, no, honestly, I'm looking
forward to it, thank you.

1096
00:59:50,314 --> 00:59:52,619
You too. Bye.

1097
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:55,625
Who was that?

1098
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:00,667
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1099
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:04,174
Santa's going incognito
in Santa's village.

1100
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:06,045
Shh.
Don't tell anyone.

1101
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:07,447
We're just doing

1102
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:09,585
some last-minute shopping.
And I'm actually really glad

1103
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:11,589
that we ran into you.
We've got some news.

1104
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,325
- Great news, actually.
- Oh, really?

1105
01:00:13,326 --> 01:00:15,430
What's the great news?
Do you remember that

1106
01:00:15,431 --> 01:00:16,933
prospective client
that I met with?

1107
01:00:16,934 --> 01:00:18,269
Uh-huh.

1108
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,239
Well, he's coming here
tomorrow night...

1109
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,643
No?! What?

1110
01:00:21,644 --> 01:00:24,682
Yes, to our show to listen
to the song I wrote

1111
01:00:24,683 --> 01:00:27,988
and with your incredible voice
bringing it to life,

1112
01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:29,860
it's unbelievable.

1113
01:00:31,597 --> 01:00:34,501
Oh, yeah. I mean,
your song is great

1114
01:00:34,502 --> 01:00:37,508
even without my voice on it,
it's perfect.

1115
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,779
Yeah, no. With your voice,
I can't miss him.

1116
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,518
He's gonna practically
hire me on the spot.

1117
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:45,356
Who knew that this little
neighbourhood show of ours

1118
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:47,728
could be literally
life-changing.

1119
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:51,235
Yeah, so much
life-changing going on.

1120
01:00:51,236 --> 01:00:53,774
Anywhoo, I gotta get this one

1121
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,913
to her mom's and we will see you
at rehearsal.

1122
01:00:56,914 --> 01:00:58,583
- Bye.
- Bye.

1123
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:00,722
Bye. See ya.

1124
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:06,498
Okay. You're gonna tell me
everything now.

1125
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:09,372
And it's gonna happen
over some hot chocolate.

1126
01:01:14,048 --> 01:01:15,784
Wait, so what?!

1127
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:18,957
I thought the audition wasn't supposed
to be until after the holidays.

1128
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:22,430
Me too. This should be
the best moment of my life.

1129
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:25,303
This is Cassandra Rogers.
And it's a lead.

1130
01:01:25,304 --> 01:01:26,773
A lead that's me.

1131
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:30,714
Yeah, so can't she see you
earlier tomorrow or later?

1132
01:01:30,715 --> 01:01:33,352
Or now?
I tried.

1133
01:01:33,353 --> 01:01:35,256
Cassandra's in meetings all day

1134
01:01:35,257 --> 01:01:37,293
and literally the only time
she can see me

1135
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,097
is before she goes
to the airport.

1136
01:01:39,098 --> 01:01:41,401
- Airport?
- She's headed back to LA

1137
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:43,573
and she's there through January
for another project.

1138
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,847
So it's literally tomorrow
or nothing.

1139
01:01:47,516 --> 01:01:50,286
Right when you're supposed
to dazzle Jason's big client

1140
01:01:50,287 --> 01:01:51,623
with your incredible voice.

1141
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,461
And give Angela the best
Christmas of her life.

1142
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:57,635
And bring back a cherished
Holiday Lane tradition.

1143
01:01:57,636 --> 01:01:59,839
Okay, now you're being

1144
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,743
a little melodramatic.

1145
01:02:01,744 --> 01:02:05,149
It's not like this Christmas
Show is gonna bring world peace.

1146
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,022
Besides, everyone
will understand.

1147
01:02:08,023 --> 01:02:11,328
This is the big break you've
been waiting five years for.

1148
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:13,065
It's an easy decision.

1149
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:16,840
Excuse me. Are you the girl
with the lovely voice?

1150
01:02:16,841 --> 01:02:20,246
The one who's singing in the Holiday
Lane Christmas Show tomorrow?

1151
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:24,321
Oh, yeah, that's me.
I'm Chloe.

1152
01:02:24,322 --> 01:02:27,494
Well, I'm Diana
and this is my husband, Levi.

1153
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:30,433
Chloe, I have to tell you
that sometimes I go

1154
01:02:30,434 --> 01:02:32,738
into the gift shop
just to hear you sing.

1155
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:35,979
We're really looking forward
to the show tomorrow night.

1156
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,282
Thank you.

1157
01:02:38,283 --> 01:02:41,689
And it's wonderful how you're
bringing the old tradition back.

1158
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:44,695
It's been a tough
couple of years

1159
01:02:44,696 --> 01:02:47,000
and you're really warming
our hearts.

1160
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:49,539
Wow, that's so nice.

1161
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:52,343
We'll see you at the show
tomorrow night.

1162
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:55,817
It was wonderful to meet you.
You too.

1163
01:02:55,818 --> 01:02:57,756
Nice meeting you.

1164
01:02:59,927 --> 01:03:04,836
Okay. So, maybe not
the easiest decision ever.

1165
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:15,691
Jason.

1166
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:16,894
Yeah.

1167
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:19,397
Is Chloe here yet?

1168
01:03:19,398 --> 01:03:22,504
I saw her earlier,
but no, she should be.

1169
01:03:22,505 --> 01:03:26,913
Oh, good. Chloe, you're here.

1170
01:03:26,914 --> 01:03:28,851
Now we can get started.

1171
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:31,657
Wait, wait.

1172
01:03:32,659 --> 01:03:35,129
I'm sensing a problem.

1173
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:37,535
You okay? What is it?

1174
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:39,840
Uh...

1175
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,411
Uh, this is so hard.

1176
01:03:43,046 --> 01:03:46,351
You remember that callback
that I had after the holidays?

1177
01:03:46,352 --> 01:03:48,188
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1178
01:03:48,189 --> 01:03:50,192
Yeah, well, um...

1179
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,967
It's actually tomorrow at 5:00.

1180
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:55,437
Mm.

1181
01:03:57,074 --> 01:04:01,649
Oh, so you won't be able to get
back in time here for the show?

1182
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:04,789
I tried everything
and literally the only time

1183
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:08,998
she can meet with me
is at 5:00, so.

1184
01:04:09,733 --> 01:04:12,806
Wow. That is such a bummer.

1185
01:04:14,175 --> 01:04:16,914
But yeah, it's fine.

1186
01:04:18,517 --> 01:04:21,288
Well, Jason, your song
is strong enough without me.

1187
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:23,192
You don't need my voice.

1188
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:26,398
But will you please tell Angela
I will make it up to her?

1189
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:28,502
Yeah. She'll get this.
She'll get it.

1190
01:04:28,503 --> 01:04:32,310
This is your shot.
And you've got to take it.

1191
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:34,616
This is great.

1192
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:38,055
Well, maybe I don't.

1193
01:04:38,056 --> 01:04:42,631
I feel so bad and maybe it's
just another audition. Right?

1194
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:46,939
Mm. This is a callback.

1195
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,679
A second callback.

1196
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,885
That means they're already
interested in you.

1197
01:04:52,886 --> 01:04:56,258
Yeah, but I've had a lot
of callbacks before.

1198
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,231
But this is for
Cassandra Rogers.

1199
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,974
I have a very good feeling
about this.

1200
01:05:04,543 --> 01:05:07,548
You do?
How can you be so sure?

1201
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:11,957
Because I'm not. I don't...
Chloe. I've made a decision.

1202
01:05:13,193 --> 01:05:15,531
I can't let you be in the show.

1203
01:05:16,265 --> 01:05:18,937
- You're not gonna let me?
- No.

1204
01:05:18,938 --> 01:05:21,576
I'm no Cassandra Rogers,

1205
01:05:21,577 --> 01:05:26,084
but I am the producer
of this show.

1206
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:29,025
And the producer is in charge.

1207
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:35,037
So, honey, you're fired.

1208
01:05:38,744 --> 01:05:40,947
Well, she's the boss, so.

1209
01:05:40,948 --> 01:05:45,190
You leave all your guilt
right here with us. You hear me?

1210
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:50,032
You go. And you knock 'em dead.

1211
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:53,506
Honestly, thank you.
Both of you for

1212
01:05:53,507 --> 01:05:55,443
being so good about this.

1213
01:05:55,444 --> 01:05:57,948
It's making it a lot easier, really.

1214
01:05:57,949 --> 01:05:59,852
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1215
01:05:59,853 --> 01:06:02,224
- 'Kay, break a leg.
- Okay.

1216
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:24,401
Okay, which one?

1217
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:26,572
Mm.

1218
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:28,442
I think that's the winner.

1219
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,947
I was thinking
the same thing, thanks.

1220
01:06:30,948 --> 01:06:34,688
Wait, you're still working?
Isn't that big audition today?

1221
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:37,861
I'm opening the gift shop,
but I will be able

1222
01:06:37,862 --> 01:06:40,299
to get out of there in time
because everything

1223
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,204
is shutting down early today.

1224
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:45,010
For the show.

1225
01:06:45,912 --> 01:06:47,081
Yeah.

1226
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:50,754
Come on. Don't worry about it.

1227
01:06:50,755 --> 01:06:52,858
I'm just really sad

1228
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:55,631
because I really
wanted to do it.

1229
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,505
That whole atmosphere
was so positive

1230
01:06:59,506 --> 01:07:03,045
and so loving, so Christmas.

1231
01:07:03,046 --> 01:07:07,622
I had never experienced anything
like that in my entire life.

1232
01:07:08,156 --> 01:07:10,794
Well, I mean, you can still
do the show next year.

1233
01:07:10,795 --> 01:07:12,564
As long as you're able
to clear your schedule,

1234
01:07:12,565 --> 01:07:14,835
Mrs. Future Broadway Star.

1235
01:07:14,836 --> 01:07:18,644
Yeah, I guess...

1236
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:22,350
I guess what I'm really worried
about is Jason.

1237
01:07:22,351 --> 01:07:27,762
He seemed really upset when
I told him that I was leaving.

1238
01:07:28,296 --> 01:07:29,865
I'm sure he'll be fine.

1239
01:07:29,866 --> 01:07:31,803
If his song is as good
as you say it is,

1240
01:07:31,804 --> 01:07:33,372
he'll get that big client.

1241
01:07:33,373 --> 01:07:36,914
For now, you just have
to focus on yourself, right?

1242
01:07:38,483 --> 01:07:40,554
Right. I love you.

1243
01:07:40,555 --> 01:07:43,192
- Love you too.
- Okay, I'm late.

1244
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:44,930
- Go on.
- Per usual.

1245
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,312
- Oh, hi. Hey.
- Hey.

1246
01:07:53,313 --> 01:07:55,584
We gotta stop bumping
into each other like this.

1247
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:56,787
Yeah.

1248
01:07:57,755 --> 01:08:00,694
Well, I'm late, again.

1249
01:08:00,695 --> 01:08:02,631
Yeah, I'm just looking for Cora,

1250
01:08:02,632 --> 01:08:04,334
we got some rehearsing
to do this morning.

1251
01:08:04,335 --> 01:08:08,776
I have to teach her your song.
So, um, catch you later.

1252
01:08:08,777 --> 01:08:12,752
Wait. Are we um...
Are we good?

1253
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:14,823
Yeah.

1254
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,231
Are you sure about that?

1255
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,237
Yeah. Why wouldn't we be?

1256
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:24,508
'Cause of the Christmas Show.

1257
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:26,378
I couldn't say no.

1258
01:08:26,379 --> 01:08:29,685
No. No, no, no. I don't care
about the show.

1259
01:08:29,686 --> 01:08:33,626
I'm happy. I'm happy for you.
You deserve this.

1260
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:36,431
This is Cassandra Rogers,
it's a big deal.

1261
01:08:36,432 --> 01:08:38,870
I mean, right.
This is your time.

1262
01:08:38,871 --> 01:08:43,346
You've been working for this.
So, this is a good thing.

1263
01:08:43,847 --> 01:08:46,786
Yeah, no. It is.
It's an amazing thing.

1264
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:49,424
- Yeah.
- Well, I will be there

1265
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,028
to celebrate
with you guys after.

1266
01:08:52,464 --> 01:08:54,068
Yeah, I don't...

1267
01:08:55,905 --> 01:08:58,109
I don't think that's
the best idea.

1268
01:08:59,646 --> 01:09:00,915
What?

1269
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:03,353
To stop by.

1270
01:09:05,423 --> 01:09:06,827
Why?

1271
01:09:07,862 --> 01:09:09,933
I think it might be
a little hard.

1272
01:09:11,603 --> 01:09:13,006
For Angela.

1273
01:09:16,412 --> 01:09:18,850
What do you mean?
I'm so confused. What?

1274
01:09:18,851 --> 01:09:20,687
Well, I mean, I think
she's starting to get

1275
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:22,156
a little bit attached to you.

1276
01:09:22,157 --> 01:09:25,563
So, this could be really hard
on her when she doesn't get

1277
01:09:25,564 --> 01:09:28,135
to see you anymore, so...

1278
01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:30,406
Not be able to see me,
what are you talking about?

1279
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:32,243
Because once you get
this part, you're gonna be

1280
01:09:32,244 --> 01:09:34,147
in a completely
different universe.

1281
01:09:34,148 --> 01:09:38,657
One that doesn't
include Angela or me.

1282
01:09:39,191 --> 01:09:41,261
I don't even have the part yet.

1283
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:43,900
Yeah, but if it's not this
part, it will be another part.

1284
01:09:43,901 --> 01:09:46,171
I mean you are so talented
that it's just a matter of time

1285
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:48,978
before the world
gets to see this.

1286
01:09:50,748 --> 01:09:52,216
Chloe!

1287
01:09:52,217 --> 01:09:54,588
Chloe, I could really use
some help in here.

1288
01:09:54,589 --> 01:09:59,097
Okay, I'm coming. Can we
please talk about this later?

1289
01:09:59,098 --> 01:10:01,034
Yeah, sure.
Not tonight, though.

1290
01:10:01,035 --> 01:10:03,139
You focus on your audition.

1291
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:07,815
You too.

1292
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:29,692
I am a new woman.

1293
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:32,798
Sales are up,
the show is gonna be so fun.

1294
01:10:32,799 --> 01:10:36,105
Even though my feet
are already killing me.

1295
01:10:37,007 --> 01:10:39,812
It has been a wonderful
holiday season.

1296
01:10:39,813 --> 01:10:42,117
Thanks to you, Chloe.

1297
01:10:44,221 --> 01:10:46,659
Well, you have Ms. Cora
to thank for that.

1298
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:49,498
Well, she said
that you inspired her.

1299
01:10:50,534 --> 01:10:53,006
- She said that?
- Mm-hmm.

1300
01:10:54,408 --> 01:10:56,144
Yeah. Well...

1301
01:10:56,145 --> 01:10:59,150
I wish there was a way I could
still do the Christmas Show.

1302
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:01,956
You have bigger fish to fry.

1303
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:05,998
You go and you get that part.

1304
01:11:08,637 --> 01:11:09,938
Thanks.

1305
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:11,609
No, no. I will finish up.

1306
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:14,247
You go, I don't want you to miss
the bus to the city.

1307
01:11:14,248 --> 01:11:17,286
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

1308
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:18,524
You're welcome.

1309
01:11:20,661 --> 01:11:22,097
Break a leg.

1310
01:11:30,313 --> 01:11:31,381
There we go.

1311
01:11:31,382 --> 01:11:33,385
Ah, that looks good.

1312
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:34,855
You nervous about tonight?

1313
01:11:34,856 --> 01:11:35,990
I'm not nervous...

1314
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:39,598
I'm petrified.

1315
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:41,435
Ah, you'll do great.

1316
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:46,078
Perfect. Looks great.
Let's get inside.

1317
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:01,207
I'm listening.

1318
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,545
Okay.

1319
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,184
Oh, that's a great idea.

1320
01:12:06,185 --> 01:12:08,388
Yeah, I'm just here
for the callback,

1321
01:12:08,389 --> 01:12:11,596
and then I'll be on my way.
Okay, good. Bye.

1322
01:12:46,165 --> 01:12:50,038
Here we go.
Okay, folks. This is it.

1323
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:51,441
We're gonna go out there tonight

1324
01:12:51,442 --> 01:12:53,445
and you are all going
to kill it!

1325
01:12:53,446 --> 01:12:56,652
And can I just say, wow.

1326
01:12:56,653 --> 01:12:58,823
Wow! You look amazing!

1327
01:12:58,824 --> 01:13:00,693
How about me?

1328
01:13:00,694 --> 01:13:03,800
Whoo! Ms. Cora.

1329
01:13:03,801 --> 01:13:06,906
You look completely ravishing.

1330
01:13:06,907 --> 01:13:09,978
Aww. Where's Angela?

1331
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:12,083
Come with me, I'll show you.

1332
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,527
She's seated with her mom,
right there.

1333
01:13:17,528 --> 01:13:18,664
Yeah?

1334
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:24,074
Oh, great.

1335
01:13:26,212 --> 01:13:28,281
Wait. That's him.

1336
01:13:28,282 --> 01:13:32,423
He came. The man from
the ad agency, he's here.

1337
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:35,363
Really? Well, we'd better
get this thing right.

1338
01:13:45,718 --> 01:13:47,087
It's starting.

1339
01:13:54,334 --> 01:13:56,437
Merry Christmas,
Ladies and Gentleman.

1340
01:13:56,438 --> 01:14:00,279
We are privileged
to bring to you tonight

1341
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:05,724
the return of the Holiday Lane
Christmas Concert.

1342
01:14:10,668 --> 01:14:14,775
You're gonna see some wonderful
local talent tonight.

1343
01:14:14,776 --> 01:14:19,350
And we guarantee to get you
into the Christmas spirit.

1344
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:21,855
But that's enough talking
from me.

1345
01:14:21,856 --> 01:14:23,727

Wasn't it great to have
this show back again?

1370
01:16:49,786 --> 01:16:52,356
One time!

1371
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:56,030
Well, sadly, it's time
to wrap things up, but...

1372
01:16:56,031 --> 01:16:59,070
Our last number
is a very special one.

1373
01:16:59,071 --> 01:17:05,115
Featuring a wonderful brand new
Christmas song written by...

1374
01:17:05,116 --> 01:17:08,690
our own, Jason Murphy.

01:17:12,732 --> 01:17:14,367

Woo!

1412
01:20:05,911 --> 01:20:07,814
- Hi.
- I'm so glad you made it.

1413
01:20:07,815 --> 01:20:10,452
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, it was close.

1414
01:20:10,453 --> 01:20:12,322
Did you like the show?
I loved it.

1415
01:20:12,323 --> 01:20:15,328
- Angela?
- Oh, sorry. My mom needs me.

1416
01:20:15,329 --> 01:20:17,399
Oh, of course.
Hi, pleased to meet you.

1417
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,070
- Bye.
- Bye.

1418
01:20:19,972 --> 01:20:23,211
So, just got the job.

1419
01:20:23,212 --> 01:20:25,148
He's hiring me.
Really?!

1420
01:20:25,149 --> 01:20:27,120
- Yes!
- That's fantastic!

1421
01:20:28,055 --> 01:20:29,557
Wait, how are you here?

1422
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,863
How'd your audition go?

1423
01:20:32,531 --> 01:20:35,135
Uh, it didn't.

1424
01:20:35,136 --> 01:20:36,605
You didn't make it?

1425
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:41,949
No, I did. I got to the city,
I showed up,

1426
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:44,955
and then I started thinking
about this thing

1427
01:20:44,956 --> 01:20:48,028
that I've wanted more
than anything in my life.

1428
01:20:49,264 --> 01:20:51,167
And I imagined
what it would feel like

1429
01:20:51,168 --> 01:20:54,809
if I was to get it and not
have you there to share it with.

1430
01:20:56,546 --> 01:20:58,583
So, I left.

1431
01:20:59,351 --> 01:21:01,121
I left, yeah.

1432
01:21:02,758 --> 01:21:06,698
I know you told me not to come
here and see Angela tonight,

1433
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:08,703
but I needed to show you.

1434
01:21:09,404 --> 01:21:11,609
Show me what?

1435
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:13,712
How much you mean to me.

1436
01:21:13,713 --> 01:21:15,716
I hate to interrupt, Chloe.

1437
01:21:15,717 --> 01:21:19,390
Edgar was holding your phone
for you offstage.

1438
01:21:19,391 --> 01:21:22,095
- I'll take this
- Thank you.

1439
01:21:22,096 --> 01:21:24,466
He said texts keep coming in.

1440
01:21:24,467 --> 01:21:27,507
He thought maybe it was
something important.

1441
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:30,847
Uh, yes, excuse me one sec.

1442
01:21:31,916 --> 01:21:33,217
Hello?

1443
01:21:33,218 --> 01:21:34,521
Mrs. Rogers?

1444
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:35,990
Chloe, thank goodness.

1445
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,894
I'm just about to leave
for the airport.

1446
01:21:37,895 --> 01:21:39,899
Listen, I am...

1447
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:42,904
I need to apologize,
I am so sorry

1448
01:21:42,905 --> 01:21:47,245
that I didn't make it today.
I had this other commitment.

1449
01:21:47,246 --> 01:21:49,083
No, I should be
the one to apologize.

1450
01:21:49,084 --> 01:21:51,855
It was unfair what we did to you
at the last minute.

1451
01:21:51,856 --> 01:21:53,692
Especially during the holidays.

1452
01:21:53,693 --> 01:21:55,428
Listen, I just need to know

1453
01:21:55,429 --> 01:21:58,001
<i>are you still available
to do the show?</i>

1454
01:21:58,002 --> 01:22:01,374
Uh, yes, of course.

1455
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,612
But don't you need to see me
in person first?

1456
01:22:03,613 --> 01:22:05,916
No, actually, I think
I've seen enough.

1457
01:22:05,917 --> 01:22:08,555
I watched your audition
piece again

1458
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:11,160
and my assistant found
a video of you online.

1459
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:14,601
You were singing a Christmas
song I never heard.

1460
01:22:14,602 --> 01:22:15,936
An original maybe?

1461
01:22:15,937 --> 01:22:18,709
<i>Christmas Feels Like
Falling in Love?</i>

1462
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:21,815
Great song.
Thank you.

1463
01:22:21,816 --> 01:22:24,921
I'm actually standing
next to the guy who wrote it.

1464
01:22:24,922 --> 01:22:27,761
Well, tell him to call me.
I might want to hire him too.

1465
01:22:28,495 --> 01:22:30,900
So, anyway, you got the job.

1466
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:33,539
So, consider yourself cast,
rehearsals start in March.

1467
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,375
Oh, my gosh.

1468
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:40,553
This is so exciting. But are
you, are you sure about this?

1469
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:43,292
Like is this not
the biggest risk?

1470
01:22:44,194 --> 01:22:47,734
Chloe, I have been doing this
for a long time.

1471
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:50,105
I know true talent
when I see it.

1472
01:22:50,106 --> 01:22:54,581
When you sing, I see your soul
shine through.

1473
01:22:54,582 --> 01:22:57,888
It's a rare gift
and it needs to be shared.

1474
01:22:58,656 --> 01:23:00,693
<i>And when Cora Lawson says
you're good,</i>

1475
01:23:00,694 --> 01:23:03,666
<i>then Chloe Bose, you are good.</i>

1476
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:05,669
Cora Lawson?

1477
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:06,705
<i>I have to go.</i>

1478
01:23:06,706 --> 01:23:08,441
I'll get in touch with you soon.

1479
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,145
Merry Christmas, Chloe.

1480
01:23:10,146 --> 01:23:13,251
Merry Christmas.
Thank you to you too.

1481
01:23:13,252 --> 01:23:14,989
Thank you so much.

1482
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:19,597
I got the part.

1483
01:23:19,598 --> 01:23:21,500
- What?
- I got the part!

1484
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:22,704
Are you serious?!

1485
01:23:23,573 --> 01:23:25,242
That's wonderful.

1486
01:23:27,146 --> 01:23:30,385
This is unbelievable.
Is it, though?

1487
01:23:30,386 --> 01:23:32,890
I heard Cassie ratted me out.

1488
01:23:32,891 --> 01:23:35,495
How do you guys know each other?

1489
01:23:35,496 --> 01:23:37,365
When I was your age,

1490
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:39,169
I got a second callback too.

1491
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,777
And I got the job just like you.

1492
01:23:42,778 --> 01:23:49,223
It was the first show Cassandra
Rogers ever produced.

1493
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:52,062
Come on. You did Broadway

1494
01:23:52,063 --> 01:23:54,399
and you just forgot
to tell us about this?

1495
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:59,176
I don't like to talk about all
that. It was a long time ago.

1496
01:23:59,177 --> 01:24:03,251
So, are there other things
that we should have seen you in?

1497
01:24:03,252 --> 01:24:05,656
I only did the one show.

1498
01:24:05,657 --> 01:24:08,963
It was a big hit, but...

1499
01:24:09,565 --> 01:24:12,904
Suddenly, I found out
I was pregnant

1500
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:17,514
and I did not want to raise
my baby from the stage.

1501
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:22,322
But when I heard you sing a few
weeks ago, it was a blessing.

1502
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:26,531
You woke me up to try
and bring some of the magic

1503
01:24:26,532 --> 01:24:28,402
back to this neighbourhood.

1504
01:24:29,204 --> 01:24:30,506
Ms. Cora.

1505
01:24:30,507 --> 01:24:32,109
Oh, excuse me.

1506
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,323
Uh, okay, wow.

1507
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,026
And speaking of wow,

1508
01:24:41,027 --> 01:24:43,866
do you happen to know
how a video of you and I

1509
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:47,006
singing your song
ended up online?

1510
01:24:47,774 --> 01:24:49,777
Angela was filming us
when we were singing,

1511
01:24:49,778 --> 01:24:53,952
and then she posted it and
I completely forgot about it.

1512
01:24:53,953 --> 01:24:57,325
Well, thanks to your
genius daughter,

1513
01:24:57,326 --> 01:24:59,429
Cassandra Rogers heard it.

1514
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:01,500
- Come on.
- And loves it.

1515
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:03,572
- Really?
- And wants you to call her!

1516
01:25:03,573 --> 01:25:05,944
- What, me?
- Yeah.

1517
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:12,924
But about the role,
I stand by what I just said.

1518
01:25:12,925 --> 01:25:16,231
I don't want it
to come between us.

1519
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:19,436
I don't want it to be...
It won't.

1520
01:25:19,437 --> 01:25:23,077
No. What you did tonight,

1521
01:25:23,078 --> 01:25:25,883
for me, for us,

1522
01:25:25,884 --> 01:25:28,789
I saw who you really are.

1523
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:31,729
You are your word.
You follow your heart.

1524
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:36,738
I want to see your star
shine the brightest of all.

1525
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:41,214
And I would be honoured to be the
man that stands right next to you.

1526
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,791
When I met you,

1527
01:25:46,792 --> 01:25:49,464
you made the whole world stop.

1528
01:25:52,136 --> 01:25:55,777
I'm gonna love you
and I won't stop.

1529
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:19,123
Subtitling: difuze
