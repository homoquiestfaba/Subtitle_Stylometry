1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,236
You're late!

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,304
I know, I'm sorry
It was a lot of traffic

3
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:10,281
Liam Liu

4
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:14,519
Profile

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,333
So, you know Kung Fu?

6
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,109
Err...

7
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:21,174
What kind of art are you?

8
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:23,097
Err...

9
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:25,029
I, I don't have a ...

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,051
Oh, you know what I love?
I love suspenders

11
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:29,068
You don't know Martial Arts?

12
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:30,277
No

13
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:32,233
It says so on your resume
that you know Martial Art

14
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,420
Is there Martial Art in this commercial?

15
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,824
I thought it was for toothpaste

16
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:38,304
Where are you from?

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,880
New York City

18
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:40,844
Queens, actually

19
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,257
But I went to Dolton, so

20
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:46,197
I retain the same leader's arrogance
No, I mean what's your ethnicity?

21
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:47,719
I'm Chinese

22
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:50,092
Speak Chinese?

23
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:52,199
Not fluently

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,388
It says here speaks Chinese fluently

25
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:58,690
I'm sorry, is there Chinese in this commercial?

26
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:00,286
I thought it was like

27
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:03,043
OK, thank you very much for coming, Liam

28
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:06,528
What? That's it?

29
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:08,432
I didn't even get to read yet

30
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:11,646
Well, we are looking for Japanese, actually

31
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:36,233
~~~SHANGHAI KISS~~~
Trasscript and Subtitle by

32
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:49,878
Don't be sad

33
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,004
What

34
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:54,099
You look sad, don't be.

35
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:56,730
It's my car

36
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,189
You know I just got told

37
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,169
because of a few parking tickets

38
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:07,194
which is why I guess I'm here utilizing L.A's
fabulous public transportation system

39
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:13,167
Well, somebody told me, I don't know who?

40
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:17,230
Whenever you're sad and blue.

41
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:21,451
And you are feeling all alone and left behind

42
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:25,584
Just take a look inside you, and you'll find

43
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:31,252
You gotta hold on, hold on through the night

44
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:35,593
Hang on, things will be all right

45
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,626
Even when it's dark, and not a bit of sparkling

46
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,934
Sing-song sunshine from above

47
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:47,483
Spraying rays of sunny love

48
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,916
Hey, that's...

49
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:54,006
'Rays of sunny love' is great

50
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:56,089
But I still don't have my car

51
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,435
Well, think of it on the bright side

52
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:00,167
What side?

53
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:04,647
You never would have got to meet me so if you use

54
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,760
Do you wanna get a cup of coffee with me?

55
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:11,116
You see if I go home now, that I'm going home alone

56
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:13,702
And it's a little scary

57
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:16,279
How old are you?

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,029
Why? Is it illegal to share
a caffeinated beverage with a minor?

59
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,052
I really shouldn't

60
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:26,507
I mean, just wouldn't be logical

61
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,865
What if I'm the one?

62
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,272
The wine?

63
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:37,169
If I am then you'll feel pretty stupid
not having a cup of coffee with me

64
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,197
I guess so

65
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:41,174
I mean I'm not saying I am the one

66
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:43,990
There's just always the possibility, you know

67
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,648
And isn't that what life's about, possibilities

68
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:50,044
I really shouldn't.

69
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:51,638
You can do anything you want to

70
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:54,324
It's the beauty of living

71
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,915
Wow

72
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:14,123
Every time I go out for something, Jo

73
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:18,904
It's always for some Kung Fu
Deli Store, Computer, Chinese...

74
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,228
You are a little Chinese guy

75
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:23,463
You are gonna go out for roles for little Chinese guys

76
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,130
I was born in New York

77
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,013
How about a role for somebody born in New York

78
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,494
Nobody asked you to quit college

79
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:31,529
And try your hand on deluquative(?) world

80
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,360
Of motion picture and tele-magnetic

81
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,612
What am I gonna do with the degree

82
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:36,358
I'm gonna spend 8 hours a day

83
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,702
Trapped in a little cubical

84
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:41,064
raking one of those desktop Zen Garden

85
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:44,400
Hey I prefer that over spend all you time
with some Malibu Barbie

86
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:46,583
Her name is Adelaide

87
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,495
She is a really sweet girl

88
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,104
You haven't even given her a chance

89
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,671
She is 16 years old

90
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:53,235
She is applying to Stanford

91
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:55,331
Everybody can apply to Stanford

92
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:57,887
You want some of that?
At least I'm going online to meet girls

93
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,712
I tell you now

94
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:02,223
God invented match.com for a reason

95
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,468
And that reason was me

96
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,301
Look, one even applied to me last night

97
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:10,264
You wouldn't like her though

98
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:11,125
Why?

99
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:12,232
She is Asian

100
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,846
Ah

101
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,006
No, but, I'm happy for you

102
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,801
I hope she love you long time

103
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:18,766
Thank you

104
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,122
Look, I gotta go

105
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:22,851
It's late, I gotta try to write something

106
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,163
It still blocked, you know

107
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:26,195
Most of the writers have to write something first

108
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:29,200
Before getting blocked

109
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:32,071
You can't be impotent without first being potent

110
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:33,521
And what the hell was that?

111
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:34,662
What?

112
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:36,616
I know that that's your dad calling

113
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:39,043
Because you got that stupid little ring

114
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:40,806
So that you know it's your dad calling

115
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:41,709
And by the way

116
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,066
He knows you sending him to voice mail

117
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:43,983
He doesn't know shit

118
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:44,676
Yes he does

119
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,532
Because you pushed end

120
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,684
You can push the end

121
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:47,920
It only rings twice and goes to voice mail

122
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:49,229
You're gonna let him go all the way to...

123
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,513
I don't wanna talk to him

124
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,404
Why?
He's the one who support you headiness to...

125
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:54,025
My dad's a drunk

126
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:55,717
My dad's insane

127
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:56,608
You don't know my dad

128
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,988
Forget about your dad

129
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,345
And forget about Malibu Addy

130
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,077
Check out this blonde at the bar

131
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:05,664
She's gorgeous.

132
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:07,401
Which one?

133
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:08,869
The one with the pink...

134
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,784
Sucking on that straw

135
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:12,116
She knows what she's doing

136
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:14,204
She is one like 8.9, at least

137
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,784
8.9?
Yeah

138
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,426
Let me tell you something, my friend

139
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,056
This girl represents everything

140
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,737
that was wrong with the society

141
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:25,033
From a fake tits to a fake nose

142
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:27,077
That fake fucking smiles

143
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:27,913
You see that?

144
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:29,636
It's a fake fucking doll bag

145
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,408
How do you know her bag is fake

146
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:32,524
You know what's the worst part?

147
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,162
She gets away with that

148
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:37,005
She gets away without having anything
close enough to resembling a real personality

149
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:39,890
The bag looks real to me

150
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:55,477
Let me guess

151
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,679
Capricorn?

152
00:06:58,729 --> 00:06:59,638
Libra

153
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,545
Close enough, you wanna buy me a drink?

154
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,140
What makes think you deserve a drink?

155
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,727
Er, because I'm a good person

156
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:08,537
By Hollywood standards

157
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:09,956
Anyway, by normal standards

158
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,604
I'm a fucking asshole

159
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,046
D'you, you think I'm a good person?

160
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:18,665
Well, I don't even know you

161
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,886
Well, the truth is I think you are really cute

162
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,598
And I was compelled to meet you

163
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,509
And normally I wouldn't surcome to my compulsion so easily

164
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:39,490
But I'm trying to embrace a new philosophy of life

165
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:42,123
That involves surcoming

166
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:45,039
And I mean if I have to surcome

167
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,747
I'm glad I'm surcoming on you

168
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,458
Hey

169
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,466
Think of this drink as...

170
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:58,361
as an investment for the possibility

171
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:02,332
of mutual growth in this potential relationship

172
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,906
Any years from now

173
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,211
When our daughter

174
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,600
Jumps to your laps, and asks you

175
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:10,963
Oh, how did mommy and daddy meet?

176
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:13,476
You can look at this drink

177
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:17,801
as the best investment you've ever made

178
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:21,945
But I gotta know if you're really committed

179
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:24,148
to continuing this conversation

180
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:26,439
before I waste my time

181
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,723
I just go, like nothing happens

182
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:33,519
I'm Georgia, by the way

183
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,034
What a coincident!

184
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:38,439
That's my favorite confederate state

185
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:42,780
This is Liam

186
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,994
I'm not here right now, leave a message

187
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,357
This is Mark Liu

188
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:49,817
Your father

189
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:51,252
Where are you anyway

190
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:52,680
It's 2 am

191
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:53,803
You should be at home

192
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,330
It's dangerous out there you know

193
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:57,250
so many FPD

194
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:59,049
I don't want you get hepatitis another time

195
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,161
I hate talking to meet you

196
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:05,082
You wanna call him?

197
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,654
Sorry

198
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:22,666
You're not a very rich guy, are you?

199
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:26,963
What gave that away, the generic brain cooler?

200
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:29,715
You don't get a lot of stuff

201
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:33,506
So maybe, maybe I'm not materialistic

202
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,087
Did Jesus have a lot of stuff?

203
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,756
No, but Jesus was poor

204
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:49,933
So, what do you do for fun?

205
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:53,903
This is pretty fun

206
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:59,239
I mean, what do you do for excitement?

207
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,763
Good night

208
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:21,377
Are you OK?

209
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:24,850
Yeah, I just, I just have allergies, you know

210
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:30,970
Are you crying? Your face's wet

211
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:35,144
No, I'm OK. Just go to sleep

212
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:11,046
Wake up, wake up

213
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,300
You have to go

214
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,478
What?

215
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,451
Wake up

216
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:15,447
You have to go

217
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:16,451
I'm late

218
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:17,425
Why?

219
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,692
Because I'm late

220
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:19,936
Why?

221
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:21,102
Because I'm late

222
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:23,150
I feel like I'm talking to Helen Keller(deaf writer) here

223
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:27,053
I promised me breakfast

224
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:29,595
There's a bagel in the fridge

225
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,222
Knock yourself out

226
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,422
I made you something

227
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,940
What

228
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:55,449
I love brownies

229
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:57,584
I know you're silly with them

230
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,313
That's why I made them for you last night

231
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,457
Thanks, you're so sweet

232
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:05,296
Oh what can I say I'm a sweetie pie

233
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,821
I'm good

234
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:13,959
What's that?

235
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,203
What's that?

236
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,874
I'm applying to an art school in Paris

237
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,171
What about Stanford

238
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,944
Ah, Stanford is boring
What?

239
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:25,201
That's what you wanna to for the rest of your life

240
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,450
is paint fruit and people dancing at tea parties?

241
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:30,078
I mean you're a bright girl

242
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,998
You know you need real education

243
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,984
Shouldn't you do what you're passionate about?

244
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:38,790
Yes, yes, that all sounds great now

245
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,835
You're doing what you're love

246
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,123
You're doing what you're passionate about

247
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,953
But in 15 years, it won't be so great

248
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:46,892
When you're selling kind of candy

249
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,316
On Santa Monica prominent

250
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,477
So it's about money

251
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,893
I just don't want you to regret this

252
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:57,491
I don't know where to go

253
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,278
I have something important to ask you

254
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,206
You're in high school, what's important?

255
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:07,810
You know canonization is not the way to a girl's heart

256
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,005
I'm sorry

257
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,288
What do you wanna ask me?

258
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:15,928
I'm sorry, I'm SO SORRY

259
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,325
Oh my goodness

260
00:13:18,326 --> 00:13:21,947
I know, I'm sorry
I can't do it like you can. What?

261
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:24,310
I was going to ask you

262
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,980
If you want to come to the junior prom with me?

263
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,140
The junior prom. Wow

264
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:33,843
I'm sorry Addy
I can't go to the junior prom with you

265
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:34,928
Why not?

266
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,653
Why didn't you go with, with, Alex, Bowta, or Whorethorn

267
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,175
Or whatever they named them nowadays

268
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:46,883
'Cause I don't love them, Liam

269
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:54,056
All righty

270
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:56,018
Out of my car, Kiddo

271
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,471
Who're you calling kiddo? Boss

272
00:13:57,472 --> 00:13:57,958
You know what

273
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,765
You better be careful
'Cause one day you'll gonna lose me.

274
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:03,462
And it's gonna break your heart into a million little pieces

275
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:07,845
I could be the best thing
that'll ever happen to you and you'll regret it.

276
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,252
Maybe not today, maybe not tommorrow
But soon, and for the rest of your life.

277
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:12,750
Now if you excuse me

278
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:15,300
I have an algebra test to attend to

279
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:20,620
All right, I'll see you in another life

280
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:24,620
When we're both illustrious oppression libertines

281
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:27,576
Or 3 pm, whichever comes first

282
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:57,585
Liam, It's Mark Liu, your father

283
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,356
(Chinese) where are you?

284
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,672
Where are you anyway?

285
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:02,357
Call me!

286
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:07,196
Monday, 1:09am

287
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,465
Liam, why are you not calling me?

288
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:12,797
Your grandmother is dead

289
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:15,007
This is Mark Liu, your father

290
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:18,943
Monday, 1:25am

291
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:34,517
Hello

292
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,882
Yeah I got your message

293
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:39,058
Maybe a few more relative die

294
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,754
You will actually come back to New York

295
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:42,655
Can you give me a break?

296
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:44,913
I'm only trying to make a living for myself right here

297
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:45,998
Oh, making a living for yourself

298
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:48,370
Without me sending you check every month

299
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:52,674
You'll be out in the street with all the others
to be or no to be

300
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:55,297
You know, I'm sorry I called

301
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:57,883
She left you her house in Shanghai

302
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:00,150
Wait, what, what did you say?

303
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:01,762
Leave me her house?

304
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,679
Why, why did she leave it to me?

305
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:05,995
I've never even met her

306
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,542
Cause your last name is Liu

307
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:08,500
That's why

308
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,958
Why did you forget who you are, huh?

309
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,729
How much does it worth?

310
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,237
500 qian(thousand)

311
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:15,907
That should last you util the end the month

312
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,009
You know
I'm sick of you criticizing my life

313
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,698
I have the right to criticize it

314
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,180
I'm paying for it

315
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,155
What about you?

316
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:28,109
I can smell the Whiskey on your breath
right through the handset

317
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,827
I'll tell you what

318
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:30,321
I'll come home today

319
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,678
If you tell me you are not holding
a bottle of Jack in your hand right now

320
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:38,526
Yeah, that's what I thought

321
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:41,515
You know what
I don't need you God damn money

322
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:42,700
What can you do?

323
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,886
Paddle Cappuccino at Starbucks?

324
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,266
Well you said I had 500 grand, right?

325
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,768
That'll last me to the end of the month

326
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,273
I'm your father, Liam

327
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,859
Why do you hate me?

328
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:55,907
Because you killed my mother!

329
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,234
Lily comes when you start to call her.

330
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:19,187
Lily runs when you look away

331
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:20,290

What's wrong! Come on

336
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,722

Why are you going to Shanghai?
Silly rabbit

338
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:43,252
My grandmother died

I'm sorry

340
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,674
I never met her or anything

341
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:52,390
But she left her house to me

342
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:54,725
My boyfriend has a house in Shanghai?!

343
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:55,820
That's really cool

344
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:58,672
Can't you please not call me your boyfriend

345
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:02,753

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,508
Call me every day.

371
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:23,478
Every minute, every hour.

372
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:27,469
Will you miss me so much, like,
intestines would bleed?

373
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,606
My intestines will spill buckets and buckets of blood.

374
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:34,562
Oh, that's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.

375
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:47,010
I'll see you when I get back, OK?

376
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,309
OK?

377
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,852
Yeah
Bye Liam

378
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:09,665
Do I look OK?

379
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:11,695
Yeah, yeah, yeah

380
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:16,408
You look fine
Listen Jo

381
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,517
I need you to do something for me while I'm in Shanghai

382
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,114
What? Renewing you're subscription to a barely legal

383
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:24,534
It's Addy

384
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:26,396
Oh, enough with Addy

385
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:27,638
Come on

386
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:30,119
I'm just, I'm gonna lay out a general rule here

387
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,059
In America, if you hook up with a 16-year-old girl

388
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,617
You're going to prison for roughly 20 years

389
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:39,670
And I'm not talking about cobber-sins

390
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,504
It's not that, it's not about hooking up

391
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:46,170
You're the cool older guy right now

392
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:50,201
But in ten years, you're just gonna be the old guy

393
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:53,124
Just take her to school in the morning, that's it

394
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:54,824
And make sure

395
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,547
She has parents

396
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:57,896
She is not little Orphan Annie

397
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:01,277
What do you want me to do?
Give her some claim shot and send her to bed?

398
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:05,210
Shit!
She was doing just fine before you got there

399
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:07,528
Yeah, you're right

400
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:09,345
I just

401
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:10,158
No no no no

402
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:12,769
I'm right
I like to hear that

403
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,376
Alright, never mind, forget it

404
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:18,578
Shit!

405
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:19,312
What?

406
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:22,464
She was supposed to be here like an hour ago

407
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,753
She stood me up

408
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:25,548
Did she get lost?

409
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:30,555
No
She thinks I'm ugly, or publican, or both

410
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,163
Yeah, what's with the brown suit?

411
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:33,929
You look like Ronald Reagan

412
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,119
I asked you about this

413
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,775
I tell you what happened

414
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:38,570
This is what Darwin was talking about

415
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:40,484
When he said natural selection

416
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,021
Only I'm the one that wasn't selected

417
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,822
Jo, women are absolutely everywhere

418
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:46,999
See that girl at the counter

419
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,737
What do you give her?

420
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:51,618
Solid 6

421
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:54,173
When you flip her around you'll get a 9

422
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:56,620
Talk to her

423
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:57,988
Come on, dude

424
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:00,206
No, I can't
That's ridiculous

425
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,503
Why is that ridiculous?

426
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:02,787
Are you kidding?

427
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,490
Don't you think it's a little psycho
to just walking up to some girl?

428
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,719
Yeah, it's psycho if you shank her in the shower afterwards

429
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:10,871
All right

430
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:14,189
Don't bring her knife

431
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:17,444
I'm not bringing her knife

432
00:22:21,978 --> 00:22:24,445
Do I look like Ronald Reagan?

433
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:26,600
You're on a good day

434
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:32,381
Gets the attention

435
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,584
Hi

436
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:43,660
Oh

437
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:46,079
Is this the butter?

438
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:56,435
I hope your plane crashes

439
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:58,039
Maybe he is her brother?

440
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,416
They kissed, what is she?
Angelina Jolly?

441
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:05,757
Can I order a big bowl of shame, please.

442
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:33,789
Hey, that's me!

443
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,451

Your father send me

447
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,400
Do you like it?

448
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:41,819
Eh, I don't know

449
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,754
Oh, I'm Ling Ming, your cousin

450
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:46,883

Why did they give you the house?

453
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,579
Actually, I'm not part of Liu family

454
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,516
The family name are just pass out through the sons

455
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,905
My mother married into Ming family

456
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,580
Where am I staying?

457
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:05,098
Jing Mao Tower

458
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:06,090
Tower?

459
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,006
I'm staying in a tower?

460
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:08,986
Yes

461
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:40,906
Minutes reaching night

462
00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:47,064
Fifty miles high

463
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:54,028
Nothing but the sky

464
00:24:54,029 --> 00:25:02,740
China in your eyes

465
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:32,085
Minutes reaching night

00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:44,455

Wow

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,328
If I have a house here

487
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,479
Why am I in a hotel?

488
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:43,394
House empty, all furniture's gone

489
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,437

It's up to you, whatever your taste

522
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:04,192
I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings

523
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:06,670
You won't hurt feelings, just pick

I was never picked for dodge ball

525
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:10,820
It always hurt my feelings

526
00:29:10,821 --> 00:29:11,801
OK, it's not big a deal

527
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:13,174

That's my favorite shape

556
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,530
OK, don't talk to him

557
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:32,894
He is not even there

558
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:35,081
Don't you have to go somewhere?

559
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:38,427
All right

560
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:57,616
You should sing

561
00:30:57,617 --> 00:31:00,061
I do not sing

562
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:03,324
If I sing, everybody in room will run

563
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,723
No, no, I'm sure you're not that bad

564
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:08,855
Trust me, that's bad

565
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:12,640
OK, I believe you

566
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:15,176
Hey you wanna go?

567
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:15,813
Ah?

568
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:17,912
You wanna go?

569
00:31:17,913 --> 00:31:19,022
OK

570
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:20,561
No no

571
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:24,532
us, you, me, we go, both of us

572
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:28,112
You want me to go with you?

573
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:33,805
You want me to want you

574
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:38,596
to go with me?

575
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,746
I'm confusing you

576
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:42,086
Let's go
You wanna go?

577
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:44,767
I'm...

578
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:49,790
Yes, you, me, you, me
Both!

579
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:51,397
One, two, go

580
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,813
Nice room
Thanks

581
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:05,456
Great view

582
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,944
What do you want to do now?

583
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,922
What ever

584
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:21,343
You tell me

585
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:30,611
Excuse me
OK

586
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,351
Hello

587
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:36,133
Is this my very sexy Chinese man?

588
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:37,445
How do you get this number?

589
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:38,768
I have my ways

590
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:40,523
Remember I'm a natural genius

591
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,511
I just got in a couple of hours ago

592
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:45,928
Why haven't you called me, I wonder, I wonder

593
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:48,146
My cousin was showing me around a little bit

594
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:50,057
Oh, what have you seen?

595
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:56,706
Em, I saw a guy on uni-cycle,
saw a KFC

596
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:58,240
It's about it

597
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:01,045
I'm going to take shower, OK?
OK, OK

598
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,837
Is someone there?

599
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:05,685
I ordered room service

600
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:07,683
This girl was just bring up late dinner

601
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,288
I can't really take the airplane food

602
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,242
Yeah, you and your sensitive digest track

603
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,996
How is Shanghai?

604
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,218
It's beautiful

605
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:21,348
My hotel room is on the 85 floor

606
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:23,350
I can see Japan from my window

607
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:24,547
How is it look?

608
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:28,086
Let's say if they're planning a sneak attack anytime soon
I'll know

609
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:30,795
Can I use the towel?
Yeah, yeah

610
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,371
Who is that?

611
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:34,967
Err, television

612
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:37,688
Listen, I'm so tired

613
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:40,076
can I call you tomorrow?

614
00:33:40,077 --> 00:33:42,070
I miss you, bunny

615
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:44,456
OK, I'll be back soon

616
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,436
Get out of the house, all right?

617
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:50,561
Go hanging out with Summer or Melisa
or any other girls on the O.C

618
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,660
Bye Liam

619
00:33:52,661 --> 00:33:54,158
Bye Addy

620
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:09,271
OK. I finish. What do you want? Tell me

621
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:13,606
You know what? I'm really tired

622
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:16,582
Do you wanna go to sleep?

623
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,746
Sleep?

624
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:23,340
I was on a flight, you know, for, I don't know, 16 hours

625
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:25,793
You know, an airplane

626
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:28,122
Do you mind?

627
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:30,022
No, I'm not mind

628
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,466
Because I like you

629
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:32,921
You're really beautiful girl

630
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,671
Thank you

631
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,020
So is it OK?

632
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:37,921
OK

633
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:41,048
Alright
Good night

634
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:42,261
Good night

635
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:11,078
Hey Liam

636
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:13,241
Let's go

637
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,570
Wake up

638
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:17,357
3 pm

639
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:30,273
(Nu nu)

640
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:31,869
(Come back, come back)

641
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:40,687
So, this is it, huh?

642
00:36:40,688 --> 00:36:42,810
Yes

643
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:53,637
Your grandmother lived up here for 60 years

644
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:54,858
Your father born here

645
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:58,642
Grow up all his life

646
00:36:58,643 --> 00:37:03,409
Be careful

647
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,388
Lots of history in this house

648
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:10,966
It's a share with ceiling

649
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:16,628
But nobody here had take care of it

650
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:18,678
Wow

651
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:21,081
This view is amazing

652
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:23,640
Yes, this is Huangpu River

653
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,301
The most important shipping outlet of Shanghai

654
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:29,741
Divide the city into east and west

655
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,637
Come on Liam

656
00:37:33,638 --> 00:37:35,111
Let me show you

657
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:40,140
This was your father's room

658
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:43,844
The whole family is live here

659
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,827
This place is great, I love it

660
00:37:50,828 --> 00:37:51,997
Yeah

661
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:59,607
It must be buyers

662
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:03,719
(Just a minute)

663
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:08,591
(You must be Mr. Wu)

664
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:12,522
(Nice meeting you)

665
00:38:22,985 --> 00:38:25,042
(No so hard to find)

666
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,702
This is Mr. Wu

667
00:38:30,703 --> 00:38:35,254
(Mr. Wu, this is my cousin from America)

668
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:38,800
(You have an interesting cousin)

669
00:38:39,227 --> 00:38:40,880
(Does he have a girl friend yet?)

670
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:43,851
(He could become my son-in-law)

671
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:52,173
I've never been to Shanghai before

672
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:56,258
So I'm surprised by how modern it is

673
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:58,361
You know, the architecture

674
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:00,207
Very modern

675
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:06,596
OK

676
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:09,110
I like your tie

677
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:13,532
Oh, look at that

678
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:29,983
(We liked this house, the sun light, and the price)

679
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:31,909
So Liam

680
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,052
Mr. We said this place is so great

681
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:37,103
It's unbelievably cheap

682
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:39,864
Yeah, if you call 500,000 dollars cheap?

683
00:39:39,865 --> 00:39:41,005
No no no no

684
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:46,123
It's not 500,000 dollars, it's 500,000 Yuan.

685
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:48,677
How much is that in dollars?

686
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:52,717
Maybe a little less than 60,000 dollars

687
00:39:52,718 --> 00:39:55,176
60,000 dollars?

688
00:39:55,177 --> 00:39:56,315
No no no no

689
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:58,113
I'm not selling this place for 60,000

690
00:39:58,114 --> 00:39:59,243
It's crazy

691
00:39:59,244 --> 00:40:00,928
Are you crazy?

692
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:04,688
This view is worth more than 60,000 dollars
Yeah, yeah, I know

693
00:40:04,689 --> 00:40:06,598
My shoes are worth 60,000 dollars

694
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,861
Tell them no, tell them I'm not selling
It's ridiculous

695
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,964
OK

696
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:12,951
(Mr. and Mrs. Wu, I'm sorry)

697
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,418
(This house is not for sale)

698
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:16,802
(We did not say anything about the price)

699
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,590
(You make the price)

700
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:31,346
What happened?

701
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:33,303
I told them

702
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:35,760
I can see that

703
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:39,705
So, what are you going to do now?

704
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:20,592
(Hello, where do want to go?)

705
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:21,789
Jing Mao, please

706
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:22,562
Jin Gao?

707
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:23,655
Jing Mao

708
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:24,556
Jin Gao?

709
00:41:24,557 --> 00:41:25,377
Jing Mao

710
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:26,742
OK

711
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:38,948
Out

712
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:40,641
No, this is not it

713
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:42,203
Jin Gao

714
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:43,184
Jing Mao

715
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:44,317
Jin Gao

716
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,189
Mao, Jing Mao, it's a hotel

717
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:53,067
Hotel? OK

718
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,297
No, not the place

719
00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:09,582
Hotel
This is nothing, Jing Mao

720
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:11,272
Ting Gao?

721
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:13,420
Jing Mao

722
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:14,345
Bing Gao?

723
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:16,386
Look at my mouth, Jing Mao

724
00:42:17,731 --> 00:42:18,195
(This guy is so annoying)

725
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:22,024
(I haven't found where he live)

726
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:23,428
Yeah what?

727
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:25,740
Oh

728
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:27,764
Oh yeah, look at that

729
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:35,234
Get out

730
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:36,719
What? Why you stop?

731
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:39,426
Why you stop? I'm not getting out

732
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:42,154
Jin Jiang?

733
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:43,885
Jing Mao

734
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:44,738
Get out of here

735
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:45,853
Jing Mao

736
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,659
Jin Jiang?

737
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,189
Jing Mao, it's famous

738
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,153
It's the tallest building here

739
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:52,165
Jin Jiang

740
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,231
You've been driving me round the city all day

741
00:42:54,232 --> 00:42:55,356
What're you? A fucking idiot?

742
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:56,349
I fuck ass!

743
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,340
You fuckie ass!

744
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,099
You fucking!

745
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,742
You fuckie!

746
00:42:58,743 --> 00:42:59,427
You fucking!

747
00:42:59,428 --> 00:43:00,409
You fuckie!

748
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,980
Where are you going? Get back

749
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:05,806
You fucking

750
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:08,121
You fuckie! You're fuckie

751
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:08,708
Jin Jiang?

752
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:10,039
Not Jin Jiang

753
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,308
Jing Mao. Mao Mao

754
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:16,203
Jin Jiang, Jiang, Jiang

755
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,708
You're gonna kill me!
You're gonna kill me!

756
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:24,530
No no no no, Jin Jiang

757
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:28,061
I need a drink
I need a drink

758
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:29,337
You're gonna drive me to drink

759
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:31,114
I need a drink

760
00:43:32,294 --> 00:43:35,047
Can you take me to a bar?

761
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:39,380
Drink?
OK! (Get it)

762
00:43:42,178 --> 00:43:45,011
You guys know how to make a chocolate martini?

763
00:43:45,012 --> 00:43:48,465
What's that? Chocolate martini?

764
00:43:48,466 --> 00:43:49,499
You know martini?

765
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,320
Yes of course
You want a martini?

766
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:55,605
No, chocolate martini, it's a martini
But you add some chocolate in it for flavoring

767
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,220
OK?

768
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:58,669
OK, I do

769
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,974
a regular martini
With chocolate in it

770
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:04,012
Chocolate martini

771
00:44:04,013 --> 00:44:07,378
(As usual?)
(Yeah, thanks)

772
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,891
Hi

773
00:44:23,711 --> 00:44:24,910
Hi

774
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,891
I'm Liam

775
00:44:27,783 --> 00:44:29,492
Mickey

776
00:44:29,493 --> 00:44:31,312
You speak English?

777
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:33,920
You speak German?

778
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,451
Why would I speak German? We're not in Germany

779
00:44:36,452 --> 00:44:38,749
Why would I speak English? We're not in England

780
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,984
Because everybody speaks English

781
00:44:40,985 --> 00:44:43,980
If that's true, then why even ask me in the first place?

782
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:46,545
Let me guess

783
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:47,652
You're an American

784
00:44:47,653 --> 00:44:50,751
And you think the world revolves surround you

785
00:44:50,752 --> 00:44:53,625
You probably don't speak any other languages beside English

786
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:56,790
That doesn't true
I speak Ethiopian

787
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:03,354
!@#$%^&*()
That means, em, armchair

788
00:45:04,588 --> 00:45:06,552
Well, why don't you speak Chinese?

789
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:08,159
Because I'm an American

790
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:09,522
You're not an American

791
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:11,373
Your face is Chinese

792
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:12,863
Your hair is Chinese

793
00:45:12,864 --> 00:45:14,349
Your eyes are Chinese

794
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,566
Your skin is Chinese

795
00:45:17,202 --> 00:45:20,125
But you probably don't know anything about your culture

796
00:45:20,506 --> 00:45:23,564
It's a pity you don't even speak the language

797
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:25,317
I know more than you think

798
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:29,964
Here is your drink

799
00:45:29,965 --> 00:45:34,285
Yes, I can see you're very wise

800
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,416
Thanks

801
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:39,672
Thank you

802
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:45,350
So what are you that you're so culture
the polaties(?) instructor?

803
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:47,681
What's that?

804
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:51,382
Never mind

805
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:53,141
Hey, you wanna get outa here?

806
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:55,999
This conversation's depressing me

807
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,569
Eat your drink first

808
00:46:01,015 --> 00:46:02,401
So beautiful

809
00:46:02,402 --> 00:46:05,315
I never realized how beautiful Shanghai is

810
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:09,267
Most of these building were developed in the Opium Wars

811
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:12,474
Refresh my memory
Robert Donnie Junior won the Opium Wars, right?

812
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:14,355
Who that?

813
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,953
Never mind

814
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:20,657
You're so cute, and so funny

815
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:23,075
Yeah, but you don't laugh at like most of my jokes

816
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:24,479
You're still funny

817
00:46:25,438 --> 00:46:27,070
Are all American so funny?

818
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:29,268
You should know
You've been there 3 years, right?

819
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:36,209
Use sense of humor as defensive mechanism of nervous

820
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,100
That's what my analyst says

821
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:39,834
You're in analysis?

822
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,423
Yeah
Ever since the second grade

823
00:46:42,438 --> 00:46:44,614
When I asked out Aaron McGrath

824
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:48,470
She called me the dudie head and
pulled down my pant during recess

825
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:50,321
That's horrible

826
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,322
I can't really blame her

827
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:55,791
Because I was quite empirically a dudie head

828
00:46:56,299 --> 00:46:59,335
But then I got very self-conscious about my penis size

829
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:05,176
Err, I mean, were small, but I was 7

830
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:07,475
I think for a 7-year-old

831
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:12,265
It was decent size, I think

832
00:47:28,117 --> 00:47:29,464
Are you nervous?

833
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:31,092
Yeah a little bit

834
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:34,523
Do I intimidate you?

835
00:47:35,972 --> 00:47:38,529
You have no idea

836
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:55,159
How was that?

837
00:47:56,403 --> 00:48:00,874
I'd say let's go back to my place
but I don't know where it is.

838
00:48:12,897 --> 00:48:14,816
Let me get this

839
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:21,639
Hello?

840
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,228
I wrote you a poem, you wanna hear it?

841
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,020
Yeah, sure

842
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:30,152
I woke up lonely the day I died.

843
00:48:30,153 --> 00:48:32,897
The sun never sang to me so bright

844
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:36,212
The songs of heaven that dance inside my eyes

845
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,917
Watching a seagull's flying

846
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:39,435
And time stands still

847
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:42,530
As I paint the penguin red and I turned blue

848
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:45,108
I thought of you and only you.

849
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:47,208
In the darkness you'll come

850
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:49,693
And drive my tears and rescue me

851
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:52,318
From the plastic cups and empty faces

852
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,921
My Shanghai Kid
My One and Only

853
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:58,395
For you I wait
Only God can stop me

854
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:09,797
Now if it totally sucks, you can tell me
I really didn't write for 5 seconds anyway

855
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:11,967
No. I like it

856
00:49:13,881 --> 00:49:17,078
Em, you know, I got to get off the bus

857
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,076
Can I call you later?

858
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:19,640
Yeah

859
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:21,743
Bye Addy

860
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:31,862
What was that?

861
00:49:32,346 --> 00:49:34,483
Your girlfriend?

862
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:36,991
No, she's just a friend

863
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,997
Just a friend

864
00:49:39,998 --> 00:49:42,296
Give me a break, she's 16

865
00:49:42,297 --> 00:49:47,672
Why are you friends with a 16-year-old?

866
00:49:48,244 --> 00:49:51,274
I don't know

867
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:56,841
Excuse me

868
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:04,615
(You make me disgusting)
(You make me puke)

869
00:50:04,616 --> 00:50:08,986
(You make me sick)
(You make me fucking...)

870
00:51:36,352 --> 00:51:38,173
What's that?

871
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:40,326
Tea egg

872
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:41,752
Tea egg

873
00:51:41,776 --> 00:51:42,516
Egg?

874
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:43,410
Egg

875
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:45,321
Egg, Let's get some
I'm hungry

876
00:51:45,737 --> 00:51:48,369
Hey, tea egg

877
00:51:48,661 --> 00:51:50,393
Hello, hello, hello

878
00:51:50,394 --> 00:51:53,136
Wake up, back to work

879
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:56,498
Hello, hello, hello
Ni Hao

880
00:51:56,499 --> 00:51:58,229
How much?

881
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:59,547
1 yuan!

882
00:51:59,548 --> 00:52:02,266
1?
1 yuan?

883
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:04,144
That's like 12 cents

884
00:52:04,145 --> 00:52:07,659
I want twelve

885
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:13,567
So, how do you say twelve?

886
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:15,019
Twelve

887
00:52:16,907 --> 00:52:18,648
(Shi Er)

888
00:52:19,366 --> 00:52:20,185
Is this good?

889
00:52:20,186 --> 00:52:21,974
Wait, hold on

890
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:24,055
Taste time

891
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:27,273
Why are you buying so many eggs?

892
00:52:27,274 --> 00:52:29,556
I may not be a smart man

893
00:52:29,557 --> 00:52:32,203
But I know a good bargain when I see one

894
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:46,533
Wow!

895
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,695
What?

896
00:52:48,696 --> 00:52:51,194
In this light, you're stunning

897
00:52:52,658 --> 00:52:54,896
You're a stunner

898
00:52:56,271 --> 00:53:00,343
I'm actually physically stunned

899
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,366
Well you're not the ugliest guy I met either

900
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:08,078
OK, OK relax

901
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,502
So, why would you sell a house
that's been in your family for 100 years?

902
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,629
What am I gonna do? Move to China?

903
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,657
Why not?

904
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:20,148
You're Chinese, aren't you?

905
00:53:20,149 --> 00:53:23,589
Why don't I do anything that makes any sense?

906
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:28,155
Why did I drop out Columbia and moved L.A.
to being an inspiring alcoholic?

907
00:53:28,156 --> 00:53:32,776
Why is that the the only girl that
I can stand being sober with for more than an hour

908
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,182
present company excluded

909
00:53:34,262 --> 00:53:35,538
happens to be 16?

910
00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:37,995
Why can't I look my father in the face?

911
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:46,334
You're right!

912
00:53:48,983 --> 00:53:53,742
I spent my entire life
running away from anything Chinese

913
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:55,658
including my father.

914
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,860
But I come here

915
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:02,357
And I feel like I belong here

916
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:07,167
Here I'm not a Chinese guy

917
00:54:07,168 --> 00:54:09,393
I'm just a guy

918
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:16,422
Don't move here just for me

919
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,689
Do you wanna see me again?

920
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:19,765
Of course!

921
00:54:19,766 --> 00:54:22,034
Would you miss if I left?

922
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:26,153
Would you miss me?

923
00:54:26,154 --> 00:54:30,735
You are the most amazing girl I've ever met!

924
00:56:51,926 --> 00:56:53,000
Hey!

925
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:54,395
Chou Yun Fat?

926
00:56:54,396 --> 00:56:56,261
Hey! We both fat

927
00:56:56,262 --> 00:56:58,319
No no no, I'm sorry
it's not him

928
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,220
It's the guy from Roman Noodle package

929
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:01,677
And you're the noodle

930
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:04,220
So, how is the People's Republic

931
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,904
It's amazing

932
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:07,867
It's so beautiful there, Jo

933
00:57:07,868 --> 00:57:09,137
It really is

934
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:10,651
And I met a girl

935
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,397
What? I like a Chinese girl?

936
00:57:12,398 --> 00:57:14,398
I met a Chinese girl!

937
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:16,082
No way! Really?

938
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,610
Yeah
Really?

939
00:57:17,611 --> 00:57:18,933
What's her name?

940
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:20,304
Her name is Mickey

941
00:57:20,305 --> 00:57:21,406
That doesn't sound Chinese

942
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,825
She is beautiful

943
00:57:22,826 --> 00:57:26,193
She's smart, sophisticated, funny

944
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:28,269
And she's with you?

945
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:31,268
It's a shame you had to leave

946
00:57:31,269 --> 00:57:32,683
Actually I'm gonna move there

947
00:57:33,288 --> 00:57:34,256
What?

948
00:57:34,257 --> 00:57:35,904
I'm moving to Shanghai

949
00:57:35,905 --> 00:57:36,910
When?

950
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,179
Next week!

951
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:43,301
I just, I came back to get some things

952
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:45,367
Say good bye

953
00:57:45,368 --> 00:57:48,280
It's pilot season

954
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:50,036
There are no Asian guys on television

955
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:52,230
You know that

956
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:54,406
So, did you tell your father?

957
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:56,114
Does Addy know? Anybody?

958
00:57:56,115 --> 00:57:57,286
No, not yet

959
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:59,136
You figured how to tell them?

960
00:57:59,137 --> 00:58:00,044
No, I will

961
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:01,721
Your father's gonna be a little surprised

962
00:58:01,722 --> 00:58:04,948
I don't give a shit what he thinks

963
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,240
Listen to yourself, man!

964
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:09,134
You're moving to Shanghai for a girl

965
00:58:09,135 --> 00:58:11,170
A Chinese girl, for God sakes

966
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:13,108
This is not just about the girl

967
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:14,128
Then what is

968
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:17,912
It just, it feels right

969
00:58:17,913 --> 00:58:20,850
I'm Chinese, I gotta go back to my roots

970
00:58:20,851 --> 00:58:23,763
Slowdown, Kuta Kinsei(?)

971
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:25,527
You don't even speak Chinese

972
00:58:25,528 --> 00:58:27,019
What the hell are you gonna do

973
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,445
What, drive a Rig Shark(?)?

974
00:58:28,446 --> 00:58:29,627
I can learn Chinese

975
00:58:29,628 --> 00:58:32,492
Learn Chinese? Liam, you barely speak English

976
00:58:32,493 --> 00:58:34,298
Don't call me Liam, Liam is my slave name

977
00:58:34,615 --> 00:58:35,218
Cute

978
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,329
Wait
Come here, come here

979
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:38,977
What?

980
00:58:38,978 --> 00:58:40,693
That's her

981
00:58:41,297 --> 00:58:42,741
Wow

982
00:58:42,742 --> 00:58:46,726
She sure likes any other Asian girl in Monterey Park

983
00:58:47,313 --> 00:58:48,695
You wanna move somewhere

984
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:51,387
Move to Monterey Park, it's lovely

985
00:58:51,388 --> 00:58:52,913
I'm miss you too

986
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:54,884
Come on, get in

987
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,587
Give me 5 bucks for parking

988
00:58:56,855 --> 00:58:58,494
So you came back early

989
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,153
You know the sell fails, sweetie

990
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:01,469
Oh, you didn't sell your house?

991
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:02,411
No

992
00:59:02,412 --> 00:59:03,710
What're you going to do now, baby?

993
00:59:04,242 --> 00:59:06,933
Well, please don't call me baby

994
00:59:07,354 --> 00:59:09,721
Baby baby baby baby BA~BY~

995
00:59:09,722 --> 00:59:11,264
I have something to tell you

996
00:59:11,265 --> 00:59:12,300
Good news?

997
00:59:12,301 --> 00:59:13,633
In a way.

998
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:14,677
Let me guess

999
00:59:14,678 --> 00:59:15,452
You're pregnant

1000
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:17,574
No, that's the last one

1001
00:59:17,736 --> 00:59:18,555
It got it aborted

1002
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,893
Oh, that's too bad
I always wanna be a father

1003
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:30,147
So what's this news?

1004
00:59:31,664 --> 00:59:33,370
This is hard to say

1005
00:59:33,371 --> 00:59:35,179
Oh, spill it, bust it, come on!

1006
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:38,035
Well, I think that we should stop

1007
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:38,949
Oh Sugar salad

1008
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,716
Give me those please

1009
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:41,824
Yeah, sure

1010
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:43,721
You're the bestest boyfriend...

1011
00:59:43,722 --> 00:59:49,305
Yeah, OK Addy
you're a great girl, you're beautiful, smart, strong

1012
00:59:49,696 --> 00:59:51,226
And you shouldn't be hanging arround with me

1013
00:59:51,227 --> 00:59:53,232
You should be with the guy at your own age

1014
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,667
I'm gonna be 17 like 2 weeks

1015
00:59:57,668 --> 01:00:00,890
What are you?
like 8 years older than me?

1016
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,890
12!

1017
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,935
Big deal

1018
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,167
I look like a dwarf
I'm even, almost taller than you

1019
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:11,861
Look, It's not my fault that my
a'pophysial plate feels immaturely

1020
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:13,648
Apo'physial!
Apo'physial!

1021
01:00:13,649 --> 01:00:15,730
Did you drink milk?
Yes, I drank milk

1022
01:00:16,128 --> 01:00:17,317
Whole 100 percent?

1023
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:18,936
Did you drink fat flavor?

1024
01:00:18,937 --> 01:00:21,803
What percent milk I drink is not the point

1025
01:00:21,804 --> 01:00:24,599
The point is I can drive and drink alcoholic beverages

1026
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,159
Not at the same time

1027
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,723
What's your point?

1028
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:31,116
Woody Allen was with a woman 35 years younger than him

1029
01:00:31,117 --> 01:00:33,007
Woody has 3 Academy awards

1030
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:36,077
When I get 3 Academy awards
I can date 12-year-olds if I want

1031
01:00:38,795 --> 01:00:40,616
I met some one

1032
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,800
Really?

1033
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:47,785
Yeah

1034
01:00:49,433 --> 01:00:50,671
Is it a girl?

1035
01:00:51,903 --> 01:00:53,760
No, it's an squirrel, actually

1036
01:00:53,761 --> 01:00:55,521
Of course it's a girl

1037
01:00:55,522 --> 01:00:58,436
I don't know, you're barely natural

1038
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:01,525
It's a Chinese girl, I met her in China

1039
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:03,028
What can I get for you?

1040
01:01:03,029 --> 01:01:04,382
We're gonna take a sugar salad

1041
01:01:08,175 --> 01:01:10,315
You're gone, for like 3 days

1042
01:01:10,316 --> 01:01:11,721
3 days!

1043
01:01:11,722 --> 01:01:13,052
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1044
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:14,791
I don't know what you want me to say

1045
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:17,691
I feel so shady now

1046
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:21,744
You don't have to feel shady

1047
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:24,027
Let's go have the sugar salads

1048
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:25,741
Fuck the sugar salad

1049
01:01:25,742 --> 01:01:27,266
Fuck her in the sugary ass

1050
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:30,339
You're dumping me for some Chinese girl?

1051
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,669
We were never really together

1052
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,136
Oh, right. I forgot, I'm only 16

1053
01:01:35,137 --> 01:01:39,836
How are you gonna maintain the relationship
with some 7-thousands-miles-away?

1054
01:01:40,521 --> 01:01:43,088
I'm moving to Shanghai

1055
01:01:44,048 --> 01:01:45,468
What?

1056
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,717
I'm moving there

1057
01:01:47,718 --> 01:01:49,077
To Shanghai?

1058
01:01:49,078 --> 01:01:51,381
Who moves to Shanghai?
No one does that

1059
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:54,445
No moves to Shanghai
I don't know, lots of people

1060
01:01:54,446 --> 01:01:57,471
I don't know. It just feels right

1061
01:01:58,223 --> 01:02:01,333
You'll just leave me here to rot?

1062
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:03,394
Leave you here to rot?

1063
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:05,305
You live in Beverly Hills for Christ

1064
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:06,872
I wish I live where you lived

1065
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:10,584
Please just go see this movie, please

1066
01:02:11,906 --> 01:02:14,313
I'm gonna get you a sugar salad

1067
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,889
Don't you have any feelings at all?

1068
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:19,848
You have your grandmother died
Don't you feel sad about that?

1069
01:02:25,091 --> 01:02:28,134
Don't you feel sad about anything?
You're like a fucking robot

1070
01:02:28,135 --> 01:02:31,819
Now you're going to China for
some girl you've only known for 2 days

1071
01:02:34,802 --> 01:02:37,776
Do you really think that you'll gonna find
what you looking for out there?

1072
01:02:37,777 --> 01:02:39,608
You need to calm down
I'm going nuts

1073
01:02:42,836 --> 01:02:45,104
Wait, just wait

1074
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:51,007
I like you, Addy, I really do
It scares me how much I like you

1075
01:02:51,244 --> 01:02:52,617
Why you are leaving

1076
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,397
Because I feel empty here

1077
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,462
It's like I'm pissing my life away.

1078
01:02:59,463 --> 01:03:02,457
L.A. is a cold and desertly place
It really is

1079
01:03:02,806 --> 01:03:04,555
It's like sucking my life right out of me

1080
01:03:04,556 --> 01:03:06,647
Maybe it's you Liam
Did you ever think of that?

1081
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:09,861
Maybe it's you sucking the life outa yourself

1082
01:03:09,862 --> 01:03:11,738
You're just a just a kid. Addy

1083
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:16,000
Go home

1084
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,472
Don't go to Shanghai, please

1085
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:23,452
It'll be a mistake, you know it'll be a mistake.

1086
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:31,414
Fell in love, with a girl

1087
01:03:31,415 --> 01:03:35,698
Lost my hold on this whole world

1088
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:39,911
Sad to say, it's about truth

1089
01:03:39,912 --> 01:03:44,160
There's nothing more that we could do

1090
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:48,500
But Love just don't quit

1091
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:52,732
So hard to see from where we sit

1092
01:03:52,733 --> 01:03:57,029
Love just don't quit

1093
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:02,521
It's not a box there ain't no live

1094
01:04:02,522 --> 01:04:06,643
Holidays, time of year

1095
01:04:06,644 --> 01:04:10,921
Call them close and hold them near

1096
01:04:10,922 --> 01:04:15,203
Some souls comes, some don't show

1097
01:04:15,204 --> 01:04:19,459
Round and round and round and goes

1098
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:23,757
But Love just don't quit

1099
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:28,011
So hard to see from where we sit

1100
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:32,369
Love just don't quit

1101
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:36,777
It's not a box there ain't no live

1102
01:05:07,764 --> 01:05:11,939
Some years past, in a day

1103
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:16,203
Somethings's changing something's faint

1104
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:20,496
Some day seems like nothing's new

1105
01:05:20,497 --> 01:05:24,792
You have me and I have you

1106
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:29,073
'Cause Love just don't quit

1107
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:33,247
Hard to see from where we we sit

1108
01:05:33,248 --> 01:05:37,536
Love just don't quit

1109
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:41,798
It's not a box there ain't no live

1110
01:05:41,799 --> 01:05:46,142
Give it out and let it end

1111
01:05:56,529 --> 01:05:59,371
(Check!)

1112
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:16,016
Excuse me, Mister

1113
01:06:16,017 --> 01:06:17,429
Do you speak English?

1114
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:22,710
I need an umbrella

1115
01:06:24,048 --> 01:06:26,983
Raining, raining

1116
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:37,504
(Excuse me)

1117
01:06:39,857 --> 01:06:42,891
(Where to)

1118
01:06:45,737 --> 01:06:48,442
(Buy)

1119
01:06:48,443 --> 01:06:50,515
(Umbrella)

1120
01:06:50,986 --> 01:06:53,331
The umbrellas right there

1121
01:06:53,332 --> 01:06:57,907
Thank you thank you

1122
01:06:57,908 --> 01:07:02,948
(raining? raining?)

1123
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,746
It's good, you should try it

1124
01:07:09,747 --> 01:07:10,839
It's so shiny

1125
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,148
I'm gonna get blinded by it

1126
01:07:13,149 --> 01:07:14,608
No it's a desert
You'll like it

1127
01:07:15,754 --> 01:07:17,034
Let's go to Mc'Donnald
This food is scaring me

1128
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:19,697
That stuff would kill you faster than poison

1129
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,956
Somewhere out there is a bunch of angry feet of chicken

1130
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:28,472
Didn't your mother ever told you not play with your food

1131
01:07:28,473 --> 01:07:29,907
I don't know I have no mother

1132
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:32,348
Everybody has a mother

1133
01:07:35,148 --> 01:07:35,929
You OK?

1134
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,795
Yeah, I'm fine, It's just

1135
01:07:39,104 --> 01:07:41,321
I don't really remember her

1136
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:43,948
I mean I have memories, but

1137
01:07:44,124 --> 01:07:48,266
I don't know which ones are real and
which ones I created because I needed them

1138
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,407
We don't have to talk about this

1139
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:59,293
No, no, it's good to talk about it

1140
01:08:03,172 --> 01:08:05,371
Well it was my birthday

1141
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,182
I was 6

1142
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:09,949
And we were coming home from dinner

1143
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:12,055
We didn't have much money then

1144
01:08:12,056 --> 01:08:13,854
So going out to eat was special

1145
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:19,206
So I wanted to order something special

1146
01:08:19,207 --> 01:08:22,910
And after looking over the menu for 30 minutes

1147
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,529
I saw that they have turtle soap

1148
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:29,241
And I thought, wow
Wouldn't it be cool to go to school on monday

1149
01:08:29,242 --> 01:08:31,820
And tell everyone that I had turtle

1150
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:34,752
But on the way to the bathroom

1151
01:08:34,753 --> 01:08:39,363
I saw the life turtle
in the Kitchen

1152
01:08:39,364 --> 01:08:41,598
And I started crying

1153
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:44,213
I could never eat such a good animal

1154
01:08:44,722 --> 01:08:47,717
And so I burst into the kitchen

1155
01:08:47,718 --> 01:08:50,726
like a knight rescuing princess

1156
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:54,815
I grab the turtle and I burst out

1157
01:08:55,753 --> 01:08:58,738
And after my parents come down the kitchen

1158
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:03,359
My mom said that I could keep the turtle

1159
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,104
As a birthday present

1160
01:09:06,105 --> 01:09:10,266
So it was sitting on my lap
in the car my father was driving

1161
01:09:10,973 --> 01:09:13,576
He may have been drunk

1162
01:09:13,577 --> 01:09:17,944
I'm not sure, but they started arguing in Chinese

1163
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:21,351
Every time they argue in Chinese
I know something's wrong

1164
01:09:23,087 --> 01:09:25,280
The rest is a blur
The next thing I know

1165
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:29,117
the car is flipped upside down on the side of the road

1166
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:34,060
There's a shart-of-class jetting from my mother's neck

1167
01:09:34,061 --> 01:09:39,074
Bloods dripping down her white blouse

1168
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:41,860
I never did find out what happened to the turtle

1169
01:09:45,085 --> 01:09:47,703
You wanna go see a movie

1170
01:09:47,704 --> 01:09:50,185
You have movies here, right?

1171
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:50,990
Of course

1172
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:52,885
Let me go to the man's room
then we can go see a movie

1173
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:08,869
I can't watch this

1174
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,849
Why not?

1175
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:15,848
Because the Rock sounds like Richard Simons
That's why not

1176
01:10:16,227 --> 01:10:18,418
Who is Richard Simons?

1177
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:20,963
Never mind

1178
01:10:22,704 --> 01:10:25,403
Who's the Rock?

1179
01:10:27,137 --> 01:10:30,873
I'm gonna get something to drink
I'll be right back

1180
01:10:47,794 --> 01:10:50,488
Hi, you reach Addy
She's not here right now to take your call

1181
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,969
I know
'Cause I'm her

1182
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:14,613
Get in the car!

1183
01:11:14,614 --> 01:11:15,639
Did you say get in the car?

1184
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,061
Why would I get in the car?

1185
01:11:17,062 --> 01:11:21,068
(Beat him)

1186
01:11:22,573 --> 01:11:28,448
Get in the car? OK? OK?

1187
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:52,538
You hit me

1188
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:56,010
Yes, very good, very smart

1189
01:11:56,011 --> 01:12:01,854
People always complaining about American education system

1190
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,773
What do you want?

1191
01:12:06,774 --> 01:12:10,361
Where are you from?

1192
01:12:11,747 --> 01:12:16,094
Here and there, I get around

1193
01:12:17,321 --> 01:12:19,855
Where are you from?!

1194
01:12:20,906 --> 01:12:23,062
I'm from Los Angeles

1195
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:27,212
California!

1196
01:12:27,213 --> 01:12:30,054
It's beautiful there isn't it

1197
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:30,940
It's OK

1198
01:12:30,941 --> 01:12:33,627
Beautiful women too

1199
01:12:33,628 --> 01:12:34,824
I've never been myself

1200
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:37,330
But I watch Hollywood movies

1201
01:12:37,331 --> 01:12:40,198
Like, em, Charlie's Angels

1202
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:41,528
You've seen Charlie's Angels?

1203
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:43,826
It's not one of my favorites

1204
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:48,499
I found the plot to be lack...

1205
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,332
Plot?!

1206
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:54,905
Who needs plot when you have
crazy American women running around

1207
01:12:55,452 --> 01:12:57,000
Right?

1208
01:12:57,926 --> 01:13:01,315
There's something doesn't make sense to me

1209
01:13:01,316 --> 01:13:04,388
You see you have Charlie's Angels

1210
01:13:04,389 --> 01:13:07,390
And crazy American girls

1211
01:13:07,779 --> 01:13:11,542
Yet you still feel the need to come here
and steal our women

1212
01:13:13,008 --> 01:13:15,889
I don't know what you're talking about

1213
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,053
I'm talking about my girlfriend

1214
01:13:18,054 --> 01:13:21,160
Mickey

1215
01:13:21,161 --> 01:13:25,201
Lately she's been acting very strange

1216
01:13:25,202 --> 01:13:28,361
Always busy

1217
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:33,251
You know what she's doing everyday

1218
01:13:33,252 --> 01:13:37,172
I have no idea

1219
01:13:37,173 --> 01:13:39,606
Who do you think you are

1220
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:42,363
You American think you can take anything you want?

1221
01:13:42,364 --> 01:13:43,734
I don't think that

1222
01:13:44,171 --> 01:13:45,154
You don't think that?

1223
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:49,101
Who discovered America?
Who discovered America?!

1224
01:13:49,546 --> 01:13:50,591
Christopher Columbus?

1225
01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:52,792
I forget

1226
01:13:52,793 --> 01:13:55,434
That's want you learned in school, right?

1227
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:56,359
But I want to find out

1228
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,403
How he can DISCOVERY a country

1229
01:13:58,404 --> 01:14:01,493
with already more than 40,000,000 native Americans

1230
01:14:01,494 --> 01:14:03,991
Where are they now?

1231
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:06,120
They welcomed you with open arms

1232
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:09,448
And you killed them all

1233
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:11,301
I guess we have different text book, huh?

1234
01:14:11,302 --> 01:14:13,089
Look, I'm Chinese

1235
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:17,478
My parent went to America as Immigrants

1236
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:21,071
You'll never be Chinese

1237
01:14:21,072 --> 01:14:24,969
You were raised on cheese burgers and pizza

1238
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:27,117
You may think you have discovered China

1239
01:14:27,118 --> 01:14:29,756
But we have been here for thousands of years

1240
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:36,951
And I'm not gonna stand around
watch you take what's right for me

1241
01:14:36,952 --> 01:14:40,694
(Stop the car)

1242
01:15:24,843 --> 01:15:27,953
Hi, you have a phone that I can use?

1243
01:15:28,334 --> 01:15:32,303
Telephone I can use?

1244
01:15:34,139 --> 01:15:36,389
You have a...

1245
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:49,237
Hi, you have phone?

1246
01:15:49,765 --> 01:15:55,002
(phone?)
(phone?)

1247
01:15:57,129 --> 01:15:59,690
Sir
Do you have a phone?

1248
01:16:01,483 --> 01:16:04,501
Hey!
Hey!

1249
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,015
Ma'm
Ma'm

1250
01:16:06,016 --> 01:16:07,626
Can I use your phone?

1251
01:16:07,627 --> 01:16:10,245
please, please please

1252
01:16:11,606 --> 01:16:13,785
Here, look, look

1253
01:16:14,507 --> 01:16:16,087
I give you this

1254
01:16:16,088 --> 01:16:18,378
You let me use that?

1255
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:20,213
OK? Can I use that?

1256
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:21,897
I'll give you money?

1257
01:16:21,898 --> 01:16:24,158
Look!
Look!

1258
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,442
(I'm not gonna sell you my phone)

1259
01:16:26,443 --> 01:16:28,052
This is all I have
Take it

1260
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:29,682
(borrow?)

1261
01:16:30,226 --> 01:16:32,768
I'll give it right back
I'll be right here

1262
01:16:32,769 --> 01:16:34,100
(My long-distance is expensive)

1263
01:16:34,355 --> 01:16:35,714
Ma'm, please

1264
01:16:35,715 --> 01:16:39,142
Thank you, see, good, happy

1265
01:16:42,717 --> 01:16:44,977
Thank you

1266
01:16:47,597 --> 01:16:49,400
Mickey!

1267
01:16:55,206 --> 01:16:56,850
I wanted to tell you

1268
01:16:57,295 --> 01:16:58,668
I really did

1269
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:01,670
But Jai Lee is not the most reasonable man

1270
01:17:02,068 --> 01:17:03,544
He gets violent

1271
01:17:03,736 --> 01:17:05,491
To beat you?

1272
01:17:05,798 --> 01:17:07,277
Who is this guy?

1273
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,723
We're to be married

1274
01:17:10,724 --> 01:17:11,851
That's terrific

1275
01:17:11,852 --> 01:17:13,614
Congratulations

1276
01:17:13,615 --> 01:17:15,632
Am I invited to the wedding?

1277
01:17:15,633 --> 01:17:17,893
You have to understand
(Sir, what can I do for you?)

1278
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,676
A bowl of huntuns please

1279
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,312
(I'm sorry, I don't understand)

1280
01:17:22,313 --> 01:17:25,167
Huntuns?

1281
01:17:25,168 --> 01:17:27,928
(A bowl of huntun)
Yes, thank you

1282
01:17:27,929 --> 01:17:30,374
What don't I understand?

1283
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,520
Do you love him?

1284
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:35,720
It's not about love

1285
01:17:35,721 --> 01:17:39,242
Then what?

1286
01:17:39,243 --> 01:17:42,261
I used to work as a waitress

1287
01:17:42,274 --> 01:17:47,230
In about a year ago
Jai Lee comes in, throwing his money around

1288
01:17:47,231 --> 01:17:51,794
Telling me how beautiful I am
And how he wants to take care of me

1289
01:17:51,795 --> 01:17:55,456
So this is all about money

1290
01:17:57,426 --> 01:17:59,852
See, that's why you would never understand

1291
01:17:59,853 --> 01:18:02,380
What don't I understand?

1292
01:18:02,381 --> 01:18:05,857
You are what we call a gold digger

1293
01:18:08,027 --> 01:18:11,205
How many siblings do you have?

1294
01:18:11,206 --> 01:18:12,705
I don't have any

1295
01:18:12,706 --> 01:18:14,756
I have 5

1296
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:16,814
3 sisters and 2 brothers

1297
01:18:16,815 --> 01:18:19,299
How much does the average American make?

1298
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,488
I don't know

1299
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:24,779
Maybe 35,000

1300
01:18:25,142 --> 01:18:28,560
I make 1200 a year

1301
01:18:28,561 --> 01:18:30,342
My family, all seven of us

1302
01:18:30,343 --> 01:18:33,364
Lived in a one bedroom apartment

1303
01:18:33,365 --> 01:18:35,194
My father died years ago

1304
01:18:35,195 --> 01:18:38,604
Leaving my mother to raise all of us
All by herself

1305
01:18:38,605 --> 01:18:41,646
So no, this is not about love

1306
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:45,674
I'm with Jai Lee to ensure my family have a better life

1307
01:18:46,635 --> 01:18:50,920
You are gonna stay in a loveless and
abusive marriage for the rest of your life?

1308
01:18:53,555 --> 01:18:55,965
Trust me

1309
01:18:55,966 --> 01:18:58,064
There are worse things

1310
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:02,295
(Sir, it's your huntun)

1311
01:19:02,712 --> 01:19:04,566
Thank you

1312
01:19:12,987 --> 01:19:14,335
You're hungry

1313
01:19:14,336 --> 01:19:16,511
Getting the shit beat out of me

1314
01:19:16,755 --> 01:19:20,667
Spending the night in a ditch
can be pretty consuming

1315
01:19:20,668 --> 01:19:24,003
But on the up side
it did my cardy over the week

1316
01:19:26,233 --> 01:19:29,157
Go back to America

1317
01:19:33,074 --> 01:19:35,749
What about you?

1318
01:19:37,324 --> 01:19:39,527
I'm be fine

1319
01:19:42,877 --> 01:19:45,170
(Welcome back here)

1320
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:47,668
(Sorry for last time)

1321
01:19:47,743 --> 01:19:52,813
(I've discussed with my cousin...)

1322
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:57,722
Have you ever seen Sinatra concert?

1323
01:19:57,723 --> 01:20:01,393
What about Billy Holiday?

1324
01:20:01,394 --> 01:20:04,076
How old do you think I am?

1325
01:20:04,077 --> 01:20:07,022
Well, my favorite is Nat King Cole

1326
01:20:07,023 --> 01:20:08,900
You listen to Nat King Cole?

1327
01:20:08,901 --> 01:20:12,360
My mommy used to play a lot of old records
when I was little

1328
01:20:12,736 --> 01:20:14,139
She used to sing to me alot

1329
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,565
You're still little

1330
01:20:25,052 --> 01:20:28,015
What's wrong?

1331
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:32,641
Just miss her, that's all

1332
01:20:33,474 --> 01:20:35,806
Just unfair

1333
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:39,666
I mean how can someone die from lung cancer
when they never even smoked

1334
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:41,598
I know what you mean

1335
01:20:42,378 --> 01:20:45,931
How?

1336
01:20:50,858 --> 01:20:57,159
Em, I don't know
I don't, I guess

1337
01:20:59,712 --> 01:21:03,263
Do you talk to you mom a lot?

1338
01:21:05,336 --> 01:21:07,899
Every night

1339
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,614
Really?

1340
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:13,431
Yeah, right before I go to sleep

1341
01:21:15,422 --> 01:21:18,079
You're a good son

1342
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:24,613
Hey Liam

1343
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:27,225
Liam?

1344
01:21:27,226 --> 01:21:32,713
Just sign this
And you are all set!

1345
01:21:37,266 --> 01:21:40,036
I can't

1346
01:21:45,848 --> 01:21:46,774
(The thing is)

1347
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:48,894
(We don't want to sell now)

1348
01:21:50,015 --> 01:21:52,295
(Not selling?)

1349
01:21:52,296 --> 01:21:54,242
(My cousin come from Amercia)

1350
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:56,603
(He thinks different than us)

1351
01:21:56,604 --> 01:22:01,133
(He may have other use for the house)

1352
01:22:21,815 --> 01:22:25,232
OK, this was fun

1353
01:22:25,233 --> 01:22:27,555
Call me the next time you want to do this

1354
01:22:27,556 --> 01:22:33,240
Hey, can you help to transfer the deed to someone else?

1355
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:35,554
I can not accept this

1356
01:22:35,586 --> 01:22:38,979
Geese Louise
If you learn anything in life

1357
01:22:39,008 --> 01:22:42,746
Learn that when some one gives you a house
You don't say I cannot accept this

1358
01:22:42,343 --> 01:22:44,141
You say fuck yeah!

1359
01:22:44,787 --> 01:22:47,947
Yeah try it

1360
01:22:47,948 --> 01:22:49,922
Fuck yeah!

1361
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,146
Alright, we'll work on that

1362
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:57,822
No one has ever done anything like this for me before

1363
01:22:57,823 --> 01:22:59,745
All I know is if you marry Jai Lee

1364
01:22:59,746 --> 01:23:01,006
You're gonna regret it

1365
01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:02,849
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow

1366
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:06,119
But soon, and for the rest of your life

1367
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:13,343
Oh, can you do me a favor?

1368
01:23:13,344 --> 01:23:15,856
Before you kicked me out of your house

1369
01:23:16,312 --> 01:23:18,386
Any thing

1370
01:23:18,387 --> 01:23:21,590
Can you read one of these letters to me?

1371
01:23:21,591 --> 01:23:24,373
Of course

1372
01:23:27,308 --> 01:23:30,975
This is from your father

1373
01:23:30,976 --> 01:23:33,403
My Xiaoyin

1374
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:38,791
I have missed you these past few months

1375
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:44,325
And I regret that I cannot be with you
during this venerable time

1376
01:23:44,326 --> 01:23:48,493
I hope that my mother is taking good care of you

1377
01:23:48,494 --> 01:23:54,127
Because she is so exited to become a grandmother

1378
01:23:54,765 --> 01:23:58,726
I am working hard in Suzhou

1379
01:23:58,727 --> 01:24:01,407
To save enough money

1380
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:05,049
For us to go to America

1381
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:09,153
I hope to make enough money

1382
01:24:09,154 --> 01:24:13,871
So that we can go before you give birth

1383
01:24:16,226 --> 01:24:19,369
I want our son to be born there

1384
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:24,752
So he can become the president of the United States one day

1385
01:24:24,753 --> 01:24:29,874
Please know, you'll always be with me

1386
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:34,111
Liu Yi

1387
01:24:36,385 --> 01:24:38,863
Wow

1388
01:24:39,367 --> 01:24:43,840
Yeah, I'll say

1389
01:24:43,841 --> 01:24:46,497
Thanks

1390
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:12,522
Thank you

1391
01:25:13,969 --> 01:25:17,560
Thank you for everything

1392
01:26:11,947 --> 01:26:14,478
Dad?

1393
01:26:18,564 --> 01:26:20,517
Dad?

1394
01:26:27,702 --> 01:26:29,150
Dad?

1395
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:39,798
Dad?

1396
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:42,440
Hey

1397
01:27:33,844 --> 01:27:35,836
I loved her

1398
01:27:36,839 --> 01:27:39,077
I know

1399
01:27:43,373 --> 01:27:45,710
I'm sorry

1400
01:27:45,711 --> 01:27:50,518
You forgive me?

1401
01:27:50,519 --> 01:27:53,798
You look skinny

1402
01:27:53,799 --> 01:27:58,276
I'll take you to lunch
No, I'll take you to lunch

1403
01:27:58,277 --> 01:28:00,429
I have a job now

1404
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:05,076
I'm paddling Cappuccinos at Starbucks

1405
01:28:13,584 --> 01:28:16,242
My son

1406
01:28:16,243 --> 01:28:17,442
I cannot believe it

1407
01:28:17,443 --> 01:28:19,187
You work for the man

1408
01:28:19,188 --> 01:28:21,055
Working for the man

1409
01:28:21,056 --> 01:28:24,478
Like kids want to say

1410
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:27,058
Nobody says that dad

1411
01:28:27,059 --> 01:28:28,303
Are you sure?

1412
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:29,158
You've been away to long

1413
01:28:29,212 --> 01:28:32,498
A kid down the street, say it all the time

1414
01:28:47,256 --> 01:28:49,750
Damn, I miss that taste

1415
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,170
How about this girl?

1416
01:28:54,171 --> 01:28:57,695
Over there, the blonde

1417
01:28:57,696 --> 01:29:00,956
Like a 7.6, 7.7?

1418
01:29:00,957 --> 01:29:02,656
What do you think?

1419
01:29:02,657 --> 01:29:03,572
She's OK

1420
01:29:03,573 --> 01:29:05,672
OK?

1421
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,298
You don't wanna play anymore?

1422
01:29:07,299 --> 01:29:12,928
Jo, did you ever think assigning women
to numeric value between 1 to 10

1423
01:29:12,929 --> 01:29:17,769
based on artificial quality is kind of superficial

1424
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:19,290
Liam, if you don't think she's cute

1425
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:22,300
Just say you don't think she's cute

1426
01:29:22,301 --> 01:29:24,614
You know what I think

1427
01:29:24,615 --> 01:29:26,912
I made a big mistake with Addy

1428
01:29:26,913 --> 01:29:33,556
You can come up with a list of
hundreds of qualities that you think are important

1429
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:34,576
in another person

1430
01:29:34,857 --> 01:29:37,969
But in the end
The heart wants what it wants

1431
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:39,958
You spend you entire life fighting that

1432
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:41,335
Oh my God

1433
01:29:41,336 --> 01:29:43,144
You just you go crazy

1434
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:47,201
Yeah, I'm sorta gone crazy just listening to you

1435
01:29:47,267 --> 01:29:47,957
Sorry

1436
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:52,522
So, you could ramble on about it with me

1437
01:29:52,523 --> 01:29:55,228
for the rest of the day

1438
01:29:55,229 --> 01:29:58,784
Or, or

1439
01:29:58,785 --> 01:30:00,900
You could call her

1440
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:03,831
You know what, I'm not gonna call her

1441
01:30:03,832 --> 01:30:05,467
I'm gonna go over there

1442
01:30:05,468 --> 01:30:07,154
I got it
Thanks

1443
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:09,170
How you're gonna get there?

1444
01:30:09,171 --> 01:30:10,380
You've sold your car

1445
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:13,301
I'll walk, I'll run, I'll fly over there

1446
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:15,879
Catch you later

1447
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,091
Nobody walks in L.A.

1448
01:30:19,654 --> 01:30:25,249
(Excuse me, I'm sorry)
(You see that guy over there...)

1449
01:30:37,713 --> 01:30:41,636
Hi
Hi

1450
01:30:42,214 --> 01:30:44,300
I made some bad decisions

1451
01:30:44,301 --> 01:30:46,620
and I'm trying to get them right

1452
01:30:46,621 --> 01:30:48,764
I chopped them where to live in

1453
01:30:48,765 --> 01:30:50,849
and stored them out of sight

1454
01:30:51,002 --> 01:30:53,059
I've gone reputational

1455
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,133
running from a fight

1456
01:30:55,305 --> 01:30:58,335
When the situation

1457
01:30:58,336 --> 01:31:03,701
is out my hands

1458
01:31:03,703 --> 01:31:06,910
Sometimes you've got to go to stay

1459
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:11,226
Let the eastest fades for where it may

1460
01:31:11,227 --> 01:31:15,453
Drop the masquerade like a life could make

1461
01:31:15,454 --> 01:31:20,785
Give it all away

1462
01:31:20,786 --> 01:31:22,419
We had a conversation

1463
01:31:22,447 --> 01:31:24,991
it was more than what we've sad

1464
01:31:24,992 --> 01:31:27,074
we had a destination

1465
01:31:27,075 --> 01:31:29,251
we could see it up ahead

1466
01:31:29,252 --> 01:31:31,358
To my imagination run

1467
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:33,577
winds around up my head

1468
01:31:33,578 --> 01:31:36,762
Trying not to face that

1469
01:31:36,763 --> 01:31:41,924
Slipping away

1470
01:31:41,925 --> 01:31:45,098
Sometimes you've got to go to stay

1471
01:31:45,168 --> 01:31:49,401
Let the eastest fades for where it may

1472
01:31:49,454 --> 01:31:53,644
Drop the masquerade like a life could make

1473
01:31:53,645 --> 01:31:57,486
Give it all away

1474
01:32:07,565 --> 01:32:09,285
What're you doing here?

1475
01:32:09,286 --> 01:32:10,418
I came to see you

1476
01:32:12,713 --> 01:32:15,818
And I know
I'm probably the last person you want to see right now

1477
01:32:15,935 --> 01:32:18,181
I wouldn't blame you if you slam the door in my face

1478
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:20,544
And I deserve it

1479
01:32:20,545 --> 01:32:22,207
I get the door slammed

1480
01:32:24,771 --> 01:32:27,184
Who is it, sweetie?

1481
01:32:28,169 --> 01:32:30,487
Just, Chinese

1482
01:32:30,806 --> 01:32:31,905
Great

1483
01:32:32,509 --> 01:32:34,161
Go to Paris

1484
01:32:34,911 --> 01:32:35,947
What

1485
01:32:35,948 --> 01:32:36,903
I want you to go to Paris

1486
01:32:36,904 --> 01:32:38,320
I want you to see the world

1487
01:32:38,321 --> 01:32:40,709
I want you to do what you're passionate about

1488
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:42,462
When I was in Shanghai

1489
01:32:42,463 --> 01:32:43,553
I had a lot of time to think

1490
01:32:43,735 --> 01:32:46,090
Nobody spoke English

1491
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:48,269
And the movies there suck

1492
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:52,669
But, I realized how badly I treated you.

1493
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:54,423
I mean you have so much heart

1494
01:32:54,424 --> 01:32:55,451
You can sing to the world

1495
01:32:55,452 --> 01:32:57,263
And I always made it seem like you needed me.

1496
01:32:57,264 --> 01:32:59,066
You don't, you never did

1497
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:02,649
I'm the one who needed you.

1498
01:33:03,037 --> 01:33:04,738
And I was scared

1499
01:33:04,739 --> 01:33:05,998
Scared of you growing up

1500
01:33:05,999 --> 01:33:07,642
Scared of you wake up one morning

1501
01:33:07,643 --> 01:33:09,644
and realizing that you didn't need me

1502
01:33:09,645 --> 01:33:10,929
Scared of you going off to Paris

1503
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:14,489
seeing the whole world out there without me.

1504
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:17,139
But I'm not scared anymore.

1505
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:19,541
And I love enough to let you go

1506
01:33:20,735 --> 01:33:23,202
You dumped me

1507
01:33:23,203 --> 01:33:27,284
And then you have this epiphany in Shanghai

1508
01:33:27,324 --> 01:33:31,715
And now you're standing here
basically giving me permission to live my life?

1509
01:33:32,933 --> 01:33:35,886
And by the way, news flash

1510
01:33:36,961 --> 01:33:39,635
I'm already going to Paris

1511
01:33:40,153 --> 01:33:42,387
You are?

1512
01:33:42,388 --> 01:33:44,677
Next week

1513
01:33:45,242 --> 01:33:47,334
Great

1514
01:33:47,335 --> 01:33:48,932
Perfect

1515
01:33:48,933 --> 01:33:51,898
That's what I wanted to hear.

1516
01:33:54,603 --> 01:33:56,294
You are gonna learn so much

1517
01:33:56,295 --> 01:33:59,024
Your are gonna meet so many interesting people

1518
01:33:59,796 --> 01:34:04,949
If you are running into Gerard Depardieu
Tell him that I loved him in Green Card

1519
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:11,454
Why do you make it so hard for me to hate you?

1520
01:34:14,237 --> 01:34:16,272
God, I'm starving

1521
01:34:16,273 --> 01:34:19,383
So, do you need some cash, bunny?

1522
01:34:19,384 --> 01:34:21,563
I'm gonna found out?

1523
01:34:21,564 --> 01:34:23,342
OK

1524
01:34:23,343 --> 01:34:25,560
So where is the food?

1525
01:34:26,693 --> 01:34:29,436
I left it at the restaurant

1526
01:34:33,192 --> 01:34:36,493
So, this is goodbye?

1527
01:34:36,494 --> 01:34:41,426
More like, see you later

1528
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,740
I'll just...

1529
01:34:58,675 --> 01:35:01,605
That was weird

1530
01:35:07,476 --> 01:35:08,993
You read the copy?

1531
01:35:08,994 --> 01:35:10,756
Yeah, sure

1532
01:35:10,757 --> 01:35:12,921
Just start whenever you're ready

1533
01:35:13,073 --> 01:35:14,471
OK

1534
01:35:14,924 --> 01:35:16,335
Right into the camera

1535
01:35:18,388 --> 01:35:21,910
Do you have genital herpes?

1536
01:35:21,911 --> 01:35:24,312
It's just...

1537
01:35:24,313 --> 01:35:26,639
Lately...

1538
01:35:26,695 --> 01:35:31,883
I've been feeling iching and burning
around in my genital area

1539
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:35,916
And how did this happen to me

1540
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:38,423
I ask myself

1541
01:35:38,424 --> 01:35:41,087
Is that girl in Puerto Rico?

1542
01:35:41,088 --> 01:35:45,666
I knew she wasn't a virgin.

1543
01:35:45,667 --> 01:35:48,753
But will I ever be able to love again?

1544
01:35:48,754 --> 01:35:51,179
Will anyone love me?

1545
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:54,725
Am I supposed to spend my entire life alone?

1546
01:35:54,726 --> 01:35:58,180
Because of one drunken night?

1547
01:35:58,181 --> 01:35:59,860
This is what I felt

1548
01:35:59,861 --> 01:36:02,063
Before I tried Provium

1549
01:36:02,064 --> 01:36:07,967
Provium daily suppressive therapy can help
reduce the frequency of outbreaks

1550
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:10,506
Make the most out of your life

1551
01:36:10,507 --> 01:36:15,807
Ask your doctor if Provium is right for you.

1552
01:36:15,808 --> 01:36:19,402
Wow, that was amazing

1553
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,585
You know, I really believed you have genital herpes

1554
01:36:24,497 --> 01:36:26,407
Do you?

1555
01:36:26,408 --> 01:36:30,387
No, I don't

1556
01:36:33,682 --> 01:36:38,145
Well I don't think we need to see anyone else

1557
01:37:15,717 --> 01:37:16,678
Sorry

1558
01:37:24,647 --> 01:37:27,538
I'll miss you!

1559
01:37:49,142 --> 01:37:52,891
Go to Paris?!
Stupid!

1560
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:14,285
God damn it

1561
01:38:14,286 --> 01:38:16,815
So stupid

1562
01:38:16,816 --> 01:38:19,154
Hey

1563
01:38:20,157 --> 01:38:24,006
Either you came to see me
or you've ordered a mail-order bridge

1564
01:38:24,895 --> 01:38:27,215
I saw you're with that guy.

1565
01:38:27,236 --> 01:38:30,875
He is one of my instructors
And he scales like a pineapple

1566
01:38:32,186 --> 01:38:34,573
You still remember me?

1567
01:38:35,623 --> 01:38:39,177
Bunny, you are my every other memory

1568
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,751
How do you know I was coming in?

1569
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,173
I called your dad.

1570
01:38:46,174 --> 01:38:49,338
God, you're like obsessed with me or something.

1571
01:38:49,339 --> 01:38:52,941
I'm more than obsessed
I'm daffy about you

1572
01:38:53,753 --> 01:38:56,761
Daffy like a duck?

1573
01:38:56,762 --> 01:38:58,030
Daffy like a duck!

1574
01:38:58,031 --> 01:39:01,287
Quack! Quack!

1575
01:39:02,797 --> 01:39:07,237
Oh these are...these are for you.

1576
01:39:07,912 --> 01:39:10,122
Thanks

1577
01:39:11,751 --> 01:39:14,337
So you think we have a chance?

1578
01:39:15,107 --> 01:39:18,150
Anything is possible

1579
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:20,052
It's the beauty of living.

1580
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:24,747
Moonlight is raining down

1581
01:39:24,748 --> 01:39:31,095
And I chose a blazing road

1582
01:39:31,096 --> 01:39:34,710
Shining like a pawning tree

1583
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:40,979
The city close a massive rose

1584
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:45,793
Swinging on a high trapeze

1585
01:39:45,794 --> 01:39:49,849
Far above the crowds I see

1586
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:54,571
All I need is Love

1587
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:57,699
Spinning around the circus grounds

1588
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:03,265
Take me and bring me home again

1589
01:40:03,266 --> 01:40:07,913
I see everything in front of me

1590
01:40:07,914 --> 01:40:15,867
It's love and only love can bring us home

1591
01:40:15,868 --> 01:40:19,259
Fires burn from sea to sea

1592
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:25,383
Warming me and I am free

1593
01:40:25,384 --> 01:40:29,216
Open doors in front of me

1594
01:40:29,217 --> 01:40:35,623
Only time knows where they lead

1595
01:40:35,624 --> 01:40:40,253
Everything I'll ever need

1596
01:40:40,254 --> 01:40:43,956
Standing there in front of me

1597
01:40:43,957 --> 01:40:49,027
All I see is love

1598
01:40:49,028 --> 01:40:52,189
Spinning around the circus grounds

1599
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:57,682
Take me and bring me home again

1600
01:40:57,683 --> 01:41:02,305
I see everything in front of me

1601
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:10,042
It's love and only love can bring us home

1602
01:41:14,966 --> 01:41:19,709
Only love, only love

1603
01:41:27,402 --> 01:41:31,851
Love, spinning around the circus grounds

1604
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:37,258
Take me and bring me home again

1605
01:41:37,259 --> 01:41:42,039
I see everything in front of me

1606
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:50,222
It's love and only love can bring us home

1607
01:41:50,223 --> 01:44:51,223
~THE END~
