1
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:23,215
There were three little pigs
and they made a house
out of twigs

2
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,119
and the wolf came...

3
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,291
He blows it down?

4
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,892
Yeah. But, what happens
in the middle?

5
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,961
I keep wanting to do
this little piggy went
to market

6
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,162
but that's with the toes.

7
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,034
And the wolf keeps blowing
the house in.

8
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:46,638
And the pigs
keep making different houses.

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,208
And... No, no, no.

10
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,614
- What the fuck do we do?
- I don't know.

11
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,118
Okay, who's ready to eat?

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,687
Oh, who's ready to eat?

13
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,624
Ah! I love how she stretches,
it's just like we do.

14
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,992
It's so funny.

15
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,027
It never occurred to me
that stretching is innate.

16
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,163
- You want to see it?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,245
Okay, it got
infected with staph,
but it's not the bad staph.

18
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,136
- What is it?
- Guess.

19
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,037
You can come closer,
it's not bad staph.

20
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,772
I still don't want
the baby touching it.

21
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,040
I can't tell.

22
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,610
It's Willow's sonogram.

23
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,012
Oh, yeah.

24
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,448
I did it for Marina.
I was just so fucking
proud of her.

25
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,151
Why it's for me,
I still don't understand.

26
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,952
You know,
she didn't even get
the epidural.

27
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,088
Oh, it's a motherfucker.

28
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,923
It's a ring of fucking fire,

29
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,659
but it was the most beautiful
experience of my life.

30
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,494
I fell
in love immediately.

31
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,829
A love I've never felt.

32
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,164
Don't take that
the wrong way, Marina.

33
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,199
No, I know
exactly what you mean.

34
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,700
- It's pure.
- Aw.

35
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,302
- Oh, you guys should do it!
- Yeah.

36
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,803
You would make
such good parents.

37
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,372
- I'm sorry. I know you...
- No, it's fine.

38
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,940
We, uh, you know, we...

39
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,608
It's just such
a game changer!

40
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,144
When I saw her,
I thought, "I know you."

41
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,213
- It's true, I recognized
her immediately.
- Because I'd read to her

42
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,682
in the womb, she knew
my voice immediately.

43
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,185
It's like
in one moment
everything is different.

44
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,287
It's like
all the stuff before...
It's a gift.

45
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,322
- We're figuring it out...
- We're just animals.

46
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,425
But now, okay,
real life. You know?

47
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,798
I can't remember Goldilocks
either anymore.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
The porridge part,
but not what happens.

49
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,269
- She gets eaten, right?
- Does she?

50
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,438
There's like an oven
that's too hot.

51
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,973
You don't want kids, right?

52
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,876
Because I don't.

53
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,145
I'm sorry, I feel
so guilty for saying that.

54
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,680
I mean, I did.

55
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,415
If we'd had the
magic sexy version

56
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,483
and one day suddenly
had a baby.

57
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,987
But all those drugs
and shots and miscarriages.

58
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,122
I don't want to do it again
and it not to work.

59
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,291
I know.
And I like our life as it is.

60
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,726
Yeah. I mean,
if we wanted to take off

61
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,962
to Paris tomorrow, we could.

62
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,697
Yeah, I mean, I think
we might have a hard time

63
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,466
finding an affordable fare
on such short notice,
but, yeah.

64
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,168
No, I know
and I couldn't leave work.

65
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,937
If we're going to do it,
we should plan it at least
a month in advance.

66
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,340
A month is still
in the realm of spontaneity.

67
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,574
No, I know.

68
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,244
I mean, the time we spent
in Rome, what was that?

69
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,578
2006.

70
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,981
- It wasn't 2006.
- Yeah, it was.

71
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,216
Because I was working
with my dad on his dance film.

72
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,138
Rome was eight years
ago already?

73
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,306
- Shit.
- Yeah.

74
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,623
I looked at
the pictures recently.

75
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,690
We were two younger people

76
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,158
standing at
the Trevi Fountain.

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,361
- We look similar.
- We look younger.

78
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,964
I tried to get you to go
to Mexico last summer.

79
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,733
I needed to finish
my documentary.

80
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,068
But you didn't finish it.

81
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,837
Well, maybe the point is
we have the freedom.

82
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,879
What we do with it
isn't that important.

83
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,843
Marina said they haven't
had sex in nearly a year.

84
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,639
Fletcher was too weirded out
by the pregnancy.

85
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,082
God.

86
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,751
Delivery?

87
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,435
What is that, a 75-watt?

88
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,873
I can't see, it's too bright.

89
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,009
It's too high a wattage.

90
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,478
I'll change it tomorrow.

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,981
<i>There was a poll
conducted in 1987</i>

92
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,917
<i>in which people were given
a series of phrases</i>

93
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,854
and asked which ones
could be found in the
U.S. Constitution.

94
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,825
One of the phrases
that got the highest
percentage of votes was,

95
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,561
"From each according
to his ability,

96
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,797
"to each according
to his need."

97
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,999
Let me see the continuities.

98
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,736
<i>...in the U.S. Constitution,</i>
<i>but is the famous</i>
<i>communist credo</i>

99
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,438
<i>popularized by Karl Marx.</i>

100
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,173
Why do they type
this stuff so small?

101
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,276
I think that's 12 point.
That's normal.

102
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:48,280
That is not 12,
it's at most eight.

103
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,215
<i>Hello?</i>
We had to cut
away from Ira here

104
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,952
- because he gets a phone call.
<i>- Sweetie, this happens every
fucking day.</i>

105
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,954
Okay, cut me to me
asking the question
about hermeneutics.

106
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,156
We could, but...

107
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,759
You look like this.

108
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,695
<i>Why is Paul Ricoeur's idea
of the hermeneutics
so suspicious?</i>

109
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,565
It's from eight years ago.

110
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:12,237
And the previous shot
of you asking any relevant
questions is this.

111
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,806
<i>What did Mills mean
by the concept of military...</i>

112
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,141
God, that was eight years ago?

113
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,677
It's been 10.

114
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,312
Are my eyes
getting hollows?

115
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,081
I don't know.

116
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,951
Well, we're getting there.

117
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,120
When I get the rest
of the grant money,

118
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,055
we'll reshoot me
asking the questions

119
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,257
along with the trip
to Istanbul.

120
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,027
Look, Josh,
I hate to bring this up,

121
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,398
but I'm gonna need
a little money soon.

122
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
No, I know,
you've been patient.

123
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,482
I'm just waiting for
the rest of the last
grant money.

124
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,304
But soon?

125
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,507
Yeah, I'll get you.

126
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,644
"Documentary is about
someone else.

127
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,179
"Fiction is about me."

128
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,341
This is a quote
from Jean-Luc Godard.

129
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,385
Now, what do we
think about this?

130
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,854
Can a documentary be personal?

131
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,259
Documentaries, I want
to say to you today,

132
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,094
can and should be about me.

133
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,931
Me meaning all of us.

134
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,933
Lights.

135
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,889
Frank, could you just,
uh, hit that switch?

136
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,340
Now, this is an image from...

137
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,111
Well, shit.

138
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,849
This should be an image
of seal hunting from
<i>Nanook of the North.</i>

139
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,823
- Sorry.
- Mmm?

140
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:42,027
- About what?
- Hey. Beautiful class.

141
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,530
Oh, thanks. I don't know
why the Power Point
didn't work, but...

142
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,799
I loved what you said
about hyper reality.

143
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,569
Thanks.
I'm Jamie. This is
my wife, Darby.

144
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,904
Josh Srebnick.

145
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,439
Nice to meet you.

146
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,274
- It was interesting.
- Thanks.

147
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,436
I'm not sure why
the Power Point didn't work.

148
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,046
How did you get in here?

149
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,881
Well, we're
auditing your class.

150
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,851
It's a continuing
education class,

151
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,487
you can't audit
a continuing education class.

152
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,658
And, hey, I really
loved your film <i> Power Elite.</i>

153
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,494
You've seen it?

154
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,795
Hey, thanks.

155
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,030
It's everything I aspire to
and you make it look so easy.

156
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,666
Uh, do you
make documentaries?

157
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,201
I shoot stuff, you know,
with friends, yeah.

158
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,302
But nothing like
what you're doing.

159
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,837
He's always shooting.

160
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,006
Don't take this the wrong way,

161
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,741
but how did you see
<i>Power Elite?</i>

162
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,142
I found a VHS on eBay.

163
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,777
I paid, like, 60 bucks for it.

164
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,480
You know what was great,
was that scene with the dogs
around the garbage.

165
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,615
How did you stage that?

166
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:39,718
Oh, uh, those dogs
were just there

167
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,420
and I said,
"Hey, shoot those dogs."

168
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,890
And we did.

169
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,491
Beautiful.

170
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:50,562
I've been working on this
other one for about
eight years now,

171
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,964
but I think
I'm zeroing in on it.

172
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,132
I'd love to see it.

173
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:59,104
Oh, I'm meeting my wife
around the corner
at this Chinese place.

174
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,346
My wife and I are going
to the same goddamn place!

175
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,743
I've learned along the way
you can discover more

176
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,545
by not knowing
all the answers,

177
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,947
by allowing yourself
to be surprised by
what you encounter.

178
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,082
Yeah, yeah.
And sometimes
that means waiting

179
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,084
years for something to happen.

180
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,453
How did you start out,
like, who influenced you?

181
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,489
Oh, well, I steal
from everyone.

182
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,392
Wiseman, Maysles, Pennebaker.

183
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,760
My first job out
of graduate school

184
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,042
was working for
Leslie Breitbart.

185
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,363
Jeez Louise.

186
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,265
That's also, incidentally,
how I met Cornelia.

187
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,568
- He's her dad.
- What?

188
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,503
This is before
they hated each other.

189
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:35,473
Cornelia also produces
her dad's films.
He's amazing.

190
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,208
He's a giant. He's a guy
I'd love to meet.

191
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,177
Do you also produce
Josh's films?

192
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,612
No, Josh likes to work alone.

193
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,715
Josh, what's your
new film about?

194
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,517
Well, I'm trying
to solve the problem

195
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,719
that Eisenstein never solved,

196
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,121
that is, how to make a film
that is both materialist

197
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,424
and intellectual
at the same time.

198
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,993
Uh, it's about the distinctly
American relationship

199
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,228
between biography and history,

200
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,563
theory and method

201
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,866
and how that relates
to power and class
in our country,

202
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,228
particularly the political,
military and economic elite.

203
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,073
It's really about America.
Eisenstein
is astonishing.

204
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,975
- I just watched <i> Strike.</i>
- Oh!

205
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,643
I'm obsessed with
Europe in the '20s, see.

206
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,745
The interwar period,
ex-patriots, that sort
of thing.

207
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,381
I keep trying to get Jamie
to do something with
before and afters.

208
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,650
All humans
love before and afters.

209
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,319
Any TV show with
before and afters
will succeed.

210
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,955
Before you said that.
After you said that.

211
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,250
- Fuck you.
- Oh.

212
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,296
What do you do, Darby?

213
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,397
Darby makes ice cream.

214
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,799
Yeah, I make ice cream.

215
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,502
I brought some of it to
the Whole Foods near us.
They're pumped.

216
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,837
It's Jamie's idea to sell it,

217
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,171
I just do it
because I like it.

218
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,640
And you guys are married?

219
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,942
That's so nice
and old-fashioned.

220
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,277
Yeah. We said our vows
in an empty water tower
in Harlem.

221
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,947
There was a mariachi band
and a Slip'N Slide.

222
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,315
- Wow!
- Oh!

223
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,416
It was beautiful.
Some rituals exist
for a reason.

224
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,884
Jamie wanted a big wedding.

225
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,452
We did it at City Hall.

226
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,355
Isaac and Benny
are walking the tracks.

227
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,124
Oh, have you done this?

228
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,493
We walked through
the subway tunnels
of the D line last week.

229
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,728
No, no, we haven't.
They're at
a bar on Essex.

230
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,397
- Do you want to come?
- Oh!

231
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,265
Do we?

232
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,200
Uh...

233
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,938
It's already past our bedtime.

234
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,900
Yeah, we're usually
in bed by 11:00.

235
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,144
- Let me get it.
- Thanks.

236
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,211
Yeah, thanks.

237
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,580
No, yeah, I'll get it.

238
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,351
If you've got any time,
and I know you're super busy,

239
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,119
I'd love to show you
what I'm working on.

240
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,721
Come by our place
this weekend.

241
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,423
I have my fall flavors.

242
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,924
They don't make
this film anymore.

243
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,460
I bought 400 packs
before they discontinued it.

244
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,097
Let's go, worm!

245
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,599
Jamie is always moving.

246
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,502
I can't leap
as fast as that kid.

247
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,037
I don't move as quickly.

248
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,999
You should see him
on roller blades.

249
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,013
I like how engaged
they are in everything.

250
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:58,583
They're all making things
and they're so excited
for each other.

251
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,118
It's selfless.

252
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
They were so respectful of us.

253
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,556
I mean, compared to
when we go out with
Marina and Fletcher

254
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,192
I feel like we're all just
talking about ourselves.

255
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,393
They asked questions.

256
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,095
They didn't ask me
any questions.

257
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,529
When I was their age,
I never would have

258
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,064
come up to me like that
and invited me out.

259
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,666
I would have been too scared.

260
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,068
They're really not nervous.

261
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,510
I just wish
you hadn't told him
I work with my dad.

262
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,972
Why?

263
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,475
I don't know,
he seems ambitious.

264
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,577
No. I don't think he thinks
that way.

265
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,011
It's about process.

266
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,546
How has he even seen
anything of yours?

267
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,148
EBay.

268
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,616
I love his shoes.

269
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,518
I have some wing tips
here somewhere.

270
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,920
I stopped wearing them
when I got shin splints.

271
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,989
It was almost like
he was studying you.

272
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,358
Can we go
to their place this weekend?

273
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
We never see our real friends.

274
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,522
Why do you suddenly
want to hang out with a
couple of 25-year-olds?

275
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,798
We were just 25.

276
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,533
I mean, we weren't,
but you know.

277
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,934
It'll be fun.

278
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,736
Um, it would probably
be Richard Dreyfuss.

279
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:52,938
He's friends with my parents.

280
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,273
Uh, a member of Parliament.

281
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,008
Um...

282
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,130
<i>Probably Shia LaBeouf.</i>

283
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,647
<i>Um, this girl who</i>
<i>wrote on that show,</i> Medium.

284
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,916
<i>- Doug Liman.
- Bill Clinton.</i>

285
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,651
<i>But I think
it's probably his office.</i>

286
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,719
<i>It's ringing.</i>

287
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,522
Yeah, it's his office.

288
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,290
<i>Robert Downey Sr.</i>

289
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,895
It's really funny.

290
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,264
I like Robert Downey Sr.
That's the latest
anyway.

291
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,467
I'm also doing
people describing scenes
from movies that they like

292
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,902
but haven't seen in a while.

293
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,304
Darby's going to do
<i>Rosemary's Baby,</i> see.

294
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,573
What have you done
to its eyes?

295
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,909
He has his father's eyes.

296
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,444
Joshy, come
with me to the playroom.

297
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,314
I want a kitten!
That's Good Cop.
This is Bad Cop.

298
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,286
I hope they don't
grow up to be assholes
because that can happen.

299
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,422
Wow! Oh, my God.

300
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,426
This is just like
my record collection.

301
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,928
Except mine are CDs.

302
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,396
CDs?

303
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,438
It took me years
to discover this stuff.

304
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,204
I need to buy a new desk.

305
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,286
You should come with me
to the lumber yard.

306
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,941
We'll make one.

307
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,742
A whole desk?

308
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,578
It's much cheaper
than buying one, see.

309
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,979
And more fun.

310
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,014
Darby, can I borrow your bike?

311
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,083
I'm going to the deli
for some Goldfish.

312
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,518
Okay.

313
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,853
Tipper, did you feed Nico?

314
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,422
I forgot.

315
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,193
That's our roommate, Tipper.

316
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,897
Ding a ling!
Chow time!

317
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,265
Nico's a chicken?

318
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,369
I have to say I really admire

319
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,538
how you guys are
so in the moment

320
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,641
and just enjoying doing
and making things.

321
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,942
It's inspiring.

322
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:42,280
People our age are so
success and results oriented,

323
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,162
they've forgotten
about process.

324
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,618
Josh, are you
success oriented?

325
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,140
- No.
- Totally.

326
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,224
I feel like there are people
who don't drop things
as much as I do.

327
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,461
I don't keep things yar.

328
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,229
She's a mess.
And an ugly eater.

329
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,364
I say that with love.

330
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,632
Fuck you.

331
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,101
It's an avocado
and almond milk sorbet.

332
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,536
- Benny designed the container.
- It tastes like that candy

333
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,172
that they sometimes make
into pigs or little fruits.

334
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,876
Yeah, it's, um...
Shit. I know that.

335
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:15,446
I keep wanting to say baklava,
but that's a Greek dessert.

336
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,688
The almond tasting
pigs and fruits are made of...

337
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,120
I'll look it up.

338
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,322
- No, that's too easy.
- Let's try to remember it.

339
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,363
- Can I now?
- No.

340
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,372
Let's just not know
what it is.

341
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,480
Over here. Let's go!

342
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,896
<i>Joshy, street beach in effect!</i>

343
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,800
<i>Get your goddamn self to the</i>
<i>bush of wick for bourbon</i>
<i>and ice cream.</i>

344
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:43,968
<i>End transmission.</i>

345
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,437
We have news.

346
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,673
I decided, with Marina
going back to work,

347
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,775
I'm going to take
a leave of absence
from the firm

348
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:51,976
and take care of Willow.

349
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,044
- Oh!
- Oh!

350
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,746
Cool. How long?

351
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,581
Indefinite.

352
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,983
It's such a load off
and I'm making enough, so...

353
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,119
Hey, it's really
just my ego at stake.

354
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,154
- Time to re-watch <i> Mr. Mom.</i>
- I already Netflixed it.

355
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,255
I got some laughs.

356
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,757
We're the boring couple
with a baby.

357
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,192
What have you guys been doing?
Tell us something fun.

358
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,154
Oh, we met
this interesting couple.

359
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,596
Jamie and Darby.

360
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,732
He's a young documentarian
and she makes ice cream.

361
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,968
I don't know what to
make of them honestly.

362
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,270
- I like her.
- They make everything.

363
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,072
It's infectious.

364
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,374
For about 12 hours,
I thought I could build
my own desk.

365
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,076
There is something
about being around them

366
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,611
that energizes you, you know?

367
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,979
How old are they?

368
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,281
- 26, 27.
- 25, 26.

369
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,382
They're children!

370
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,850
Yeah, nine years ago,
they couldn't vote.

371
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,419
- But they're married.
- Why?

372
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,354
You should see
this guy's record collection.

373
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,257
It's Jay-Z,
it's Thin Lizzy, it's Mozart.

374
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,858
His taste is democratic.

375
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,593
It's <i> The Goonies</i>
and it's <i> Citizen Kane.</i>

376
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,196
They don't distinguish
between high and low,
it's wonderful.

377
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,531
When did <i> The Goonies</i>
become a good movie?

378
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:50,201
And it's like their apartment
is full of everything
we once threw out,

379
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,170
but it looks so good
the way they have it.

380
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,892
Who directed
<i>The Goonies?</i> I'll look it up.

381
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,845
Why is it that when
one person picks up
their phone,

382
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,246
- everybody else has to?
- I'm not on my phone.

383
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:07,218
Each of us is so certain that
we've got the most important
thing to do right now.

384
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,619
I know, it's so rude.

385
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,822
Not anymore.
It used to be
but now it's accepted.

386
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,591
It's like showing
your ankles in the 1800s.

387
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,394
The almond tasting pigs
and fruits are made of...

388
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,628
- Marzipan!
- Marzipan!

389
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,130
Ugh!

390
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,600
I thought...

391
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,635
You guys want to hit
this street beach with us?

392
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:25,903
I don't know
what you're saying.

393
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,272
It's something
Jamie and Darby are doing.

394
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,041
Since when do you guys
do two things in one night?

395
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,076
- You never go anywhere.
- We go anywhere.

396
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,778
We have to
get back for the sitter.

397
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,246
Scratch that,
we want to get back.

398
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,747
I hate being away from her.

399
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,716
- The sitter?
- Yeah.

400
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,685
We've lost you to the baby.

401
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,253
You guys have to come
see her again.

402
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,622
You should, really.
We're always home.

403
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,390
Anytime, come by.
We're always home.

404
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,992
- All right, okay.
- See ya.

405
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,894
We have lost them to the baby.

406
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,463
We go anywhere, right?

407
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,665
We never go anywhere.

408
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,103
High kick contest!

409
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,052
Whoa!

410
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,423
- What's the rumpus, Srebnicks?
- You came!

411
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,859
Have you tried this?

412
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,828
Someone at some college
figured out that if you put

413
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,865
Jolly Ranchers in vodka
for 24 hours, it's awesome.

414
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,301
- Can I run an idea by you?
- Sure, what?

415
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,903
It's a project
I want to shoot.

416
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,137
Okay.

417
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,740
I've never done Facebook,
it's not my thing, see.

418
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:36,807
Oh, really?

419
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,109
Yeah, I was
against it at first,

420
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,378
but it's actually
quite a useful tool.

421
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,914
I mean, it makes me feel
like I'm really connected.

422
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,950
And there's pictures...
Ow! What the shit?

423
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,318
- Watch it!
- I love you!

424
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,353
- Ha! All right.
- It's lame, yeah.

425
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,689
That's why I'm doing
this new thing with it.

426
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,492
I'm going to start a profile
and wait for people
to contact me.

427
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,094
Well, that part's normal,
that's Facebook.

428
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,796
And whoever the first person
is from my childhood,

429
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,398
someone I'm no longer
in touch with,

430
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,035
who contacts me
instead of responding
to them on Facebook, see,

431
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,938
I'm going to go
find them in person.
With my camera.

432
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,005
Okay.

433
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,407
Like make Facebook real.

434
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,209
It's like, you want
to talk to me, let's talk.

435
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,810
Kind of just like real life?

436
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,745
Exactly.

437
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:17,148
Well, real was there
before Facebook.
Right!

438
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,850
Sounds interesting.

439
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,386
I'm not sure it's enough.

440
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,121
- What do you mean?
- Well, think about
what you want to say.

441
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,590
I mean, what are you
hoping to find?

442
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,058
Well, I'll know
when I get there.

443
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,460
You said, we should
be open to surprises, right?

444
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,730
But it might not be
a full enough meal yet,
you know?

445
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,232
Keep digging.

446
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,236
When I criticize
quantitative analysis,

447
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,405
it's not because statistics
don't tell us anything.

448
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,609
On the contrary,
I'd say they are
often very revealing.

449
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,451
In fact,
they can often be
most revealing when...

450
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,715
I've got to go to the gents'.

451
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,116
Wait, the mic.

452
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,752
Thank you.

453
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,662
- I guess he's just doing that.
- Yeah.

454
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,704
Hey, Josh,
how's that grant money doing?

455
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,533
I'm expecting an email
any day now confirming...

456
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,403
No, thanks, but the rest of
the grant money is coming?

457
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,604
Yes.

458
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,539
Assuming they get funded
for the next calendar year.

459
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,275
Did you feed the dog?
I'm about to, sweetie.

460
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,576
What does that mean?

461
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,178
I don't know,
one of the donors
left his wife and...

462
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,080
I don't know. But they're
confirming the funding.

463
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,382
Why'd he leave his wife?

464
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,186
I don't know.

465
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,529
Hey, Fox!

466
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,298
Hey, Foxy Fox!

467
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,767
I was just going to call you
to see if you wanted to
get lunch.

468
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,001
Oh, how sweet.

469
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,038
Uh, this is Pepper and Elise.
This is Cornelia.

470
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,172
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

471
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,307
We're going to a music class.

472
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,574
It's really just
for the mothers,

473
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,742
they don't do anything yet.

474
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,711
- Do you want to come?
- Oh, maybe.

475
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:54,779
Ah! Come on, then!

476
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,781
How old are your kids?

477
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,016
Mine? I, I don't
have any kids.

478
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:02,086
Oh, you're gonna...
You were just coming
to hang out.

479
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,754
Cool.

480
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,323
It's adorable.

481
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,957
If you didn't know better,
you'd think they're
having seizures.

482
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,826
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

483
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,896
Hello, hello. Let's get
our hello hands high
in the sky.

484
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:15,232
And let's wave hello
to each and every one
of our friends

485
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,101
- on this train with us today.
- Hi!

486
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:20,338
That's right. It's time
to get this party started.

487
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,218
Now everybody say, choo-choo!

488
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,986
Choo-choo.

489
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,189
- Choo-choo.
- Together. Choo-choo

490
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,810
Holy shit!

491
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,514
Now everybody say choo-choo!

492
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:06,050
Choo-choo!
Say choochoo!

493
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,386
I mean, I love her,
she's a great mom,

494
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,421
but I always felt like
if I had a baby,

495
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,590
the baby would just
fold into my life.

496
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,258
I mean, if you spend
all your time

497
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,527
at baby classes,
you become a baby.

498
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,562
It's like the mothers are
infantilized, you know?

499
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,064
I know, just, like,
have a baby.

500
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,099
You're cool, you know,
cool people who have a house

501
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,535
and, I don't know,
just have a baby.

502
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:25,836
You're going to Mexican food

503
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:26,971
and there's a baby
on the floor.

504
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,839
I know. That's how I grew up.

505
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,975
I want a baby.
Maybe I'll just have
a baby right now.

506
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,177
You should. You can.

507
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,513
I like kids
who don't speak English.

508
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,381
When are you
going to have babies?

509
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:40,551
A couple of times
I got pregnant but
it didn't happen.

510
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,219
I'm sorry.

511
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,954
The longest
only went eight weeks.

512
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,190
After 35, it's a shit-show.

513
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,525
I'm sorry.
You don't have to tell me.

514
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,193
- No, it's okay.
- It's what happened.

515
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:50,428
I like telling you.

516
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,390
I like how you give
Josh a hard time.

517
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,565
I don't think
I give him a hard time.

518
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,267
It reminds me of my mom.

519
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,068
How she was with your dad?

520
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,339
God, she'd yell at him
but then iron all his
weird racing T-shirts.

521
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,775
I mother Jamie.

522
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,278
Ugh.
Sorry, I stink.

523
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,446
- It's okay.
- Here we go.

524
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,168
- What kind of class
is this again?
- Hip-hop.

525
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,468
Ooh, I like that one.

526
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,311
We need these and these.

527
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,642
- Whoo!
- Ow!

528
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,632
Ah.

529
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,869
Hey, Jamie!

530
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,009
Well, it's a just
a strained muscle.

531
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,292
But the more concerning
thing here is your arthritis.

532
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,647
Arthritis?

533
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,609
Yes. You have
arthritis in your knee.

534
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,720
Uh, is arthritis
a catch-all for

535
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,422
some kind of injury
to the...

536
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,458
No, arthritis is
a degradation of the joints.

537
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,427
Yeah, I know what
traditional arthritis is.

538
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,695
But...

539
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,764
I'm not sure
what you mean
by "traditional",

540
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:07,846
but this is arthritis.

541
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,668
Arthritis arthritis?

542
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,070
Yes, I usually
just say it once.

543
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,105
At my age?

544
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,308
You're what, 42?

545
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,076
44.

546
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:23,414
Well, it happens
at 42 and it happens at 44.

547
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:26,817
I'm going to get you a
prescription for paracetamol.

548
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,320
We'll start there and see
how it progresses, okay?

549
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,228
Have you had your eyes
checked recently?

550
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,059
I have genetically great eyes.

551
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,861
You're growing up.

552
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:38,929
It's weird, you know?

553
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,766
Are only going to happen
when you get older are
actually happening.

554
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,168
If I'm going to be
totally honest with myself,

555
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,736
I don't think
I'm ever going to die.

556
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,438
- I know that's crazy.
- It's crazy.

557
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
I think
I'm pathologically happy.

558
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:53,444
For a while the fact that
we got married was so amazing.

559
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,079
I mean, we were married!

560
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:59,049
Now we're just married,
you know?

561
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,250
Do you ever feel that?

562
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,286
Best decision I ever made.

563
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,254
- I really like this place.
- Oh, hey!

564
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,090
I got my first response
on Facebook.

565
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:08,225
- Yeah?
- This guy, Kent Arlington.

566
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,661
I haven't seen him since
high school in Santa Cruz.

567
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,429
Did you, uh,
flesh it out more, the idea?

568
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,164
A little, yeah.
He's living in Poughkeepsie.

569
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,447
Tipper and I are gonna
ride the old zip there
and find him.

570
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,869
- Mmm. Shit.
- What?

571
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,105
My father-in-law.
What is he doing here?

572
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,541
- Where?
- How are you?

573
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,410
Good, Leslie, you?

574
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,812
Good. Gearing up
for my memorial.

575
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,581
Leslie is having a tribute
at Lincoln Center next month.

576
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,083
- Whew!
- What are you doing here?

577
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,685
How do you even know
about this place?

578
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,207
Are you kidding?
I've been coming here
for pizza since it opened.

579
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,423
This is Jamie, my friend.

580
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:44,061
But both <i> Wedding</i>
and <i> Arlo Takes a Bath</i>
changed my life.

581
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,863
It made me want
to tell stories in
the non-fiction mode.

582
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,097
Oh, thank you.

583
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,366
No, thank you for your films.

584
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,602
- How's my daughter?
- How does she seem to you?

585
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,337
Seems well.
So, why are you asking me?

586
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,641
Cornelia tells me
you're looking for
finishing money.

587
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,109
Maybe. It depends
on the grant.

588
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,911
If this guy leaves his wife
or not.

589
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,680
I met a guy,
hedge fund or something,

590
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,415
he's interested in
putting money into docs.

591
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,916
I can arrange
a meeting if you want.

592
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,851
I think I'm okay.
Don't be proud, Josh.

593
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,386
I'll call you
with his number tomorrow.

594
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,721
- Okay.
- Nice to have met you.

595
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:11,789
Same.

596
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,267
Jeez Louise, working with him
must've been astonishing.

597
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,435
It's complicated.

598
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:25,936
I felt I was seen
as his protege

599
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,472
and I married his daughter.
I needed to establish
my own voice.

600
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,374
I think he thought
I rejected him,

601
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,542
or that I was arrogant.

602
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,677
I don't know. Maybe I was.

603
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,112
But you'll take that meeting?

604
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,281
- Probably not.
- You have to, Yosh.

605
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,049
I mean,
money's money, right?

606
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,751
Yeah, but I never pitch.

607
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,553
I just don't think
in sound-bites.

608
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,888
I understand we're a culture
of sound-bites, but...

609
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,257
I'll help you, you know,
make it sound beautiful.

610
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,379
It is beautiful,
but beautiful to some suit.

611
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,199
- Maybe.
- You can totally
say no to this,

612
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,361
but would you
have any interest in
co-directing with me?

613
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,669
Oh!

614
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,639
No, it's your thing.

615
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:05,809
- I totally get it, yeah.
- Yeah, it should be
your thing.

616
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,282
- I got this.
- Cool.

617
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,953
Shall we go?

618
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,955
Uh, you go ahead,
I got to take a leak.

619
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,561
This was fun. Thanks.

620
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,082
He just asked me to co-direct
like it was nothing.

621
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,050
I've been trained
to hoard credit,

622
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,812
- these kids are so generous.
- Yeah, I know.

623
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,455
Yeah.

624
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,824
What do you mean, "you know"?
Which part?

625
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,292
About credit.

626
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,860
My dad always
said that about you.

627
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,562
You don't collaborate well.

628
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,697
He "always" said that?
What's "always"?

629
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,466
I don't know, twice.

630
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,034
Remember that time
I wanted to do that thing

631
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,602
about the public school
in the Bronx,

632
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,838
and you were really
excited about it

633
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,406
until I suggested
we do it together

634
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,342
and then you...
You just, kind of, dropped it.

635
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,264
Well, maybe
we should have done it.

636
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:15,712
We still could.

637
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:16,780
The time's passed.

638
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,049
I'm sorry about that.

639
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,011
I want to be better
about that stuff.

640
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,287
Thanks.

641
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,392
What is that, a hoe-down?

642
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,061
Hip-hop.

643
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,163
Hey, Fox!

644
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,698
Fox, do you guys want to come

645
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,400
- to the Connecticut
house this weekend?
- Hey, honey...

646
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:37,768
Connecticut this weekend?

647
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,236
No, we have the Ayahuasca.

648
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,078
Where's the cardboard sleeve
for this Wilco CD?

649
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,873
What's on it?

650
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,641
The same image
that's on the CD.

651
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,143
<i>- Why do you need it?
- The CD is right there.</i>

652
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,212
<i>I don't know.
It makes it special.</i>

653
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,447
<i>It'll be us and Pepper</i>

654
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,616
and her husband Reade
and Elise and Dwight.

655
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:56,220
And then Willow,
Oscar and Peter
who they're calling Nemo.

656
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,988
That's a lot of people.

657
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,389
Well, the last three
are infants.

658
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,592
Yeah, I know.
It's just that we've got this

659
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:04,161
Ayahuasca ceremony
this weekend with Jamie
and Darby.

660
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,597
What's an Ayahuasca ceremony?

661
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,732
I guess there's a shaman
and you have to wear
white clothes

662
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,501
and you drink
this sludgy liquid that, um,

663
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,370
is made from a Peruvian root

664
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,839
and you hallucinate
and vomit up your demons.

665
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,507
Okay.

666
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,109
Well, we're just
having a cookout

667
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,444
and maybe playing charades.

668
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:23,780
Yeah, no, it sounds great.
It's just bad timing.

669
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,350
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>
Goodbye, Fox.

670
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,417
Bye, Fox.

671
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,881
Supposedly, everyone sees
Egyptian imagery.

672
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,016
Oh, yeah?

673
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,118
I want to clear
some father issues.

674
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,686
You?

675
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,889
Oh, uh, I don't know.

676
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,124
It's good to have a focus.

677
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,628
Broken hearts
and broken wings.

678
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,864
Sing the song...

679
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:15,065
Fear of death?

680
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,403
You know, linear time
not being such a big deal.

681
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:20,470
Mmm.

682
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,807
- What's the bucket for?
- Puking.

683
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,448
Sing the song
you are here to sing.

684
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,852
Welcome to the light.

685
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,022
Breathe in light,
breathe out darkness.

686
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,528
Breathe in love.

687
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:46,663
This is our 20s.

688
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,266
I'm 43.

689
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,301
Breathe out fear.

690
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,840
Breathe in truth,
breathe out ignorance.

691
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,148
Welcome to the work.

692
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,153
This shaman
is kind of a d-bag.

693
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,856
We're purging
dark energies past pain.

694
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,933
- That's my bucket.
- I'm puking out your shit!

695
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,146
Ah.

696
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,537
Honey, I feel it!

697
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:05,609
Oh, my God,
I see a fucking pyramid.

698
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,711
And a sphinx.

699
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,666
It's true, you see
Egyptian shit.

700
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,983
Honey, what are you seeing?

701
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:15,786
I'm in a deli in Bensonhurst.

702
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,521
I don't believe
in any state-supported art.

703
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,563
I think you need to
just do it yourself.

704
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,663
The serpent, Apep,
is speaking to me.

705
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,666
He's... He's saying,

706
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,502
"Go to the cattle of Ra."

707
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,240
The Celestial Cow is waiting.

708
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,642
I voted for Romney.

709
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,949
Watch the carpet.

710
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,985
I was falling asleep today
on the L train

711
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:51,187
and you know how your brain
gets in these loops?

712
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,025
I couldn't remember
the shape of a pineapple.

713
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:02,466
No, they're like footballs
with the ends cut off.

714
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:04,835
It's hard
to call to mind
the shapes of things.

715
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:05,902
Do you find that?

716
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,144
It's not dangerous?
No, I mean, I can...

717
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:16,213
I can take the medicine
and I can still have my boat.

718
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,949
I ran a half marathon
on the medicine one time.

719
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,117
How big
is your boat?

720
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,185
- It's 42 feet.
- Hmm.

721
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,221
I want to do that.

722
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,723
I feel like you were born
1,000 years ago.

723
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,397
Maybe don't flirt
with the shaman.

724
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,466
He was telling me
about his boat.

725
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,237
What?

726
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,807
I wish you'd look at me
the way you look
at Jamie and Darby.

727
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:44,875
I look at you that way.

728
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:46,810
No, you don't. You used to.

729
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,446
When we first met
you were like
you are with them,

730
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:51,615
you wooed me
with romantic emails.

731
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,785
It wouldn't make sense for me
to send you emails now.

732
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,322
We're in the same room
all the time.

733
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:03,493
I just wish
I could feel that energy
from you once in a while.

734
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,405
Josh, I'm sorry.

735
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,377
You taste different.

736
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,506
- Josh?
- It's me.

737
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,015
Jamie?

738
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,516
Shit. I thought you were Josh.

739
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,254
I'm so fucked up.

740
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,826
I, uh... I'm really sorry.

741
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,728
It's okay, worm.

742
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,383
Let's never do that again.

743
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,062
It stopped working.

744
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,130
Cornelia,

745
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,934
mine stopped working anymore.

746
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,571
Nothing is happening.

747
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,875
How you doing, Yosh?

748
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,506
Is yours working?
Mine isn't working.

749
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,681
Mine's working.

750
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,519
What if I don't find
anything out?

751
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,722
Just roll with it.
You're going to be fine, see.

752
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,791
Thanks, Jamie.

753
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,029
You're so kind.
And so generous.

754
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,866
I'm so proud and selfish.

755
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,271
I want to be
generous like you.

756
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,840
I want to help you
with your film.

757
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:59,442
I'll come to Poughkeepsie
and help you film the guy.

758
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,944
And I don't want
credit or anything,

759
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,013
just to help out.

760
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:05,315
Thanks, Joshy,
that's beautiful.

761
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:08,197
Before we met,
the only two feelings
I had left were

762
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,123
wistful and disdainful.

763
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,726
And being around you...

764
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,529
I see what's possible again.

765
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,967
Is that corny?

766
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,902
It's goddamn corny, Joshy.

767
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,305
Yeah, I guess it is.

768
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,540
I'm a cornball.

769
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,547
Thanks.

770
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:38,715
No problem, Jussle.

771
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,379
It's still tonight for us,
but it's tomorrow
for everyone else.

772
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,664
Let's have kids.

773
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,466
Or a kid. Something.

774
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,103
Did the Celestial Cow
tell you this?

775
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,604
Yes.

776
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,646
But that doesn't
make it any less true.

777
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,010
All these people have babies,
what's the big deal?

778
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,680
I thought we'd decided.

779
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,882
I don't want this to be
every time you take
a hallucinogen

780
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,150
you want to have a baby.

781
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,353
Not every time.

782
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,424
We missed our chance.
I missed my chance.

783
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,494
I'm fine with that.

784
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,601
Is that the shaman's Vespa?

785
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,892
- Fun.
- Nice.

786
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,527
Connecticut has
the best thrifting.

787
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,963
He'll drop us off
before they do their filming.

788
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,332
Tipper and I started a band
called Cookie O'Puss.

789
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:03,666
Have you seen that on YouTube?

790
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,435
Yeah, that was a commercial
when I was a kid.

791
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,903
It's fucking hilarious.

792
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,705
I know, we used to
always do the voice.

793
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:12,108
- My name is Cookie O'Puss!
- My name is Cookie O'Puss!

794
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,270
It's the name of our band.

795
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,548
My name is Cookie O'Puss!

796
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,722
Fudgie the Whale?

797
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:26,884
- All right, you ready?
- Yup.

798
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,926
He was this, kind of,
beautiful combination

799
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,896
of jock and brain,
and he could sing.

800
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,198
He was in the a cappella group
called the Night Owls.

801
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,634
I mean,
kind of the perfect guy.

802
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,683
Hey, I called,
my name's Jamie,

803
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:54,765
I'm a friend of Kent's.

804
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,387
- Kent isn't here.
- Oh.

805
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,256
Will he be back soon?

806
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,294
What's...
We went
to school together.

807
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,430
It's been a while,
but he contacted me
recently on Facebook.

808
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,587
It would mean a lot to me
if I could see him.

809
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,739
I don't bite.

810
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,838
<i>I told my sister
I had an accident,</i>

811
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:50,840
<i>but that's not true.</i>

812
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,876
I've been unhappy.

813
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,078
I did it to myself.

814
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:57,480
I cut my wrists.

815
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,549
You were the guy.

816
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,252
You know, you were beautiful.

817
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:04,687
I mean, you dated
Jenny Pepperdine.

818
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,957
You know, I bought a necklace
like the one you used to wear.

819
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,059
- My puka shells?
- Yeah.

820
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,297
You know, I was going through
a tough time in high school,

821
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,569
my mom was really sick
with ovarian cancer,

822
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,654
I was pretty promiscuous,
but I couldn't love anyone,

823
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,809
I had body issues.

824
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,047
You had written
a poem for English,

825
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,983
I mean, you were
this athlete and you wrote
this beautiful poem.

826
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,285
Do you know what poem
I'm talking about?

827
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:37,120
Aah...

828
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:39,489
- I wrote a lot of poems.
- It was a line,

829
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:44,260
very simple, but effective,
"I want to be unbridgeable."

830
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,940
You know, that one line
got me through
my mother's illness.

831
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,907
Yeah?

832
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,623
I don't know why
I stopped writing poetry.

833
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,061
I stopped doing
a lot of things.

834
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,484
Why do we stop doing things?

835
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,888
Life happens I guess, huh?

836
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,956
Life is other plans.

837
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,224
Yeah.

838
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,507
Life is what happens when
you're making other plans.

839
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,562
Who is he?

840
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,947
He was soulful-ish, you know.

841
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,582
Sister, that's an
understatement.

842
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:41,751
You can tell he's been
to some dark places.

843
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:43,586
We went to
some dark places, too.

844
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:46,389
I bought a dress.
Cornelia didn't buy a corset.

845
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,558
Mmm, this burger
is incredible.

846
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,692
Holy shit.

847
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:50,893
- What's wrong?
- No, nothing.

848
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:53,563
I just Googled Kent.
Did you Google him?

849
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:55,264
No, I wanted it to be fresh.

850
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:57,634
This is... There's a picture,
it's the same guy.

851
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,968
He was in Afghanistan.

852
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,503
- Really?
- Yeah.

853
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:04,240
He... This article says
he was part of a massacre
in Wanat.

854
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,609
They opened fire
on a bus full of civilians.

855
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:09,312
He then spoke out
about it publicly.

856
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,747
And then refused to fight.

857
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,181
He was jailed briefly,

858
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:15,218
then returned to battle,
was injured and given
the Purple Heart.

859
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,285
You're kidding?

860
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,923
It says two men in his unit
have killed themselves.

861
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:22,058
Tipper.

862
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,460
Could you do it again,
what you did?

863
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,727
Which part?

864
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,169
The phone, the discovery,
everything.

865
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:27,764
Oh, um...

866
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,238
It's the same guy.

867
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,753
Is that how I said it?
What did I say?

868
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,742
Uh...

869
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:40,810
It's the same guy!

870
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,513
Holy shit!

871
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:44,580
Jamie, look at this.

872
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,119
It says two men in his unit
have killed themselves.

873
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,721
- We have to go back.
- Yeah?

874
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:52,922
We have to get him
talking about this.

875
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,223
This is the movie!

876
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:56,392
Now it's not just some
stupid Facebook thing.

877
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,161
Not that that wasn't
a good idea, too.

878
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:01,330
But, and I hate
this expression,
but you stepped in shit!

879
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,634
- Cornelia!
- What?

880
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:06,736
Thank God
I've got you, Joshy!
We did what you said.

881
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,439
We didn't know the answers,
we discovered them.

882
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:11,708
Oh, I should get
a good book on Afghanistan.

883
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,177
And war in general.
I really know so little
about it.

884
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,045
You know who
you should talk to?

885
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,113
Ira Mandelstam,

886
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,248
the guy who's in my film.

887
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,551
He could tell you
a lot about war and
the politics of war.

888
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:23,486
That's your guy,
though, Joshy.
I can't take your guy.

889
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:25,128
I don't care.
I want to share
him with you.

890
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,524
Jeez Louise, that would be
fucking beautiful.

891
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:32,562
You know, if you want help,
I could help or produce
this for you.

892
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,530
My dad's between
things right now.

893
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:36,399
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

894
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,767
I would be so pumped.

895
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,603
Thank you, thank you.

896
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,740
Thank you!

897
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,079
He's been cooped up
with a baby at home,

898
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,081
and Marina loves
these soup dumplings.

899
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,818
I haven't spoken
to Fletcher in a while.
I think he's exhausted.

900
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,520
We'll probably
be waking them up.

901
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,916
Cornelia, Josh.

902
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,886
Gaby, Mike!

903
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,621
- You look amazing!
- Oh, thank you.
So do you.

904
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,688
You look good.

905
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,824
Hi.

906
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:36,125
Oh, fucking shit.

907
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,765
Are you guys, um,
having a thing?

908
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,834
Yeah, we...

909
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,202
God, this is embarrassing.

910
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,870
Is it a baby thing?

911
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:50,039
No, actually
Willow's at my mother's.

912
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,374
Oh.

913
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,577
We weren't invited.

914
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,612
- Well, we didn't think...
- Oh, God, I don't know
what to say.

915
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,047
Hey, girly girl.

916
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,315
- Hey!
- Hey.

917
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,984
- Oh, you look fine!
- Thank you.

918
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,085
Hey, Cornelia,
how are you?

919
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,420
- Hey, Grace.
- Hi.

920
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:07,022
- Come inside,
there's a full bar.
- Hey.

921
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,558
What is going on?

922
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,393
I'm sorry.
We didn't think
you'd want to come.

923
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:11,961
Why?
Well, for one thing

924
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,396
these are people our own age.

925
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:14,664
Oh, come on!

926
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,299
And maybe you have
a titseeka ceremony
or something.

927
00:47:16,301 --> 00:47:17,934
Ayahuasca!

928
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:20,469
It was therapeutic.
I learned some shit.
I think Cornelia did, too.

929
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,972
Yeah, I did, too.
Learn some shit.

930
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:24,807
Hey, you guys were whacked out
on Peruvian mescaline,

931
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:26,209
of course you'll
learn some shit.

932
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:28,945
I went under during
a colonoscopy last week,
I learned some shit.

933
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,780
Don't patronize us, man.

934
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:32,114
Listen, we don't know
how else to say this,

935
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:34,217
but we're worried
about you guys.

936
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,751
Yeah, you know...

937
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:37,320
I mean, I respect the fact
that you don't want
to have kids.

938
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:39,622
Don't make this about
the baby cult, okay, Marina?

939
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,624
I don't appreciate that
kind of superior attitude.

940
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,526
- It's really ugly.
- That's not what I'm saying.

941
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,261
I can't help it
if I want you to have kids.

942
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:47,430
We think you guys would
really benefit from it.
That's all.

943
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:50,600
You don't realize
how inappropriate it is
to say it the way you say it.

944
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:52,635
Not everybody wants a baby!

945
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,904
Not everyone
can have one all the time.

946
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:57,206
- Hi, sexy lady!
- Elise! Come in.

947
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,675
Bruce! Come in.

948
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,677
- Thank you.
- Hey, you've lost weight.

949
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,312
Uh, yeah. It's my suit.

950
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:06,282
Since we've had the baby,
I feel you pulling away,
Cornelia. I just do.

951
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,450
- What's with the hat?
- What?

952
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:09,452
I went to a fucking
baby music class with you!

953
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:10,786
You look like assholes
I went to high school with.

954
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,088
Cruise by prom but not go in.

955
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,723
Do you know
how humiliating that is?

956
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,291
- We're old men, Josh.
- Speak for yourself.

957
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:17,159
Why is that humiliating?
This is my life now.

958
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:18,527
You're an old man with a hat.

959
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,963
It can be very isolating and
lonely when you have a kid.

960
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,565
Yeah, I can tell.

961
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,433
- Let's go, Josh.
- Stay!

962
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,168
You're here. Come in.

963
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,050
There is no way
we're coming in.

964
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:46,088
The idea of the war
on terrorism can be understood

965
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,925
in terms of a new idea of war.

966
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:51,260
Infinite justice,
they called it at first.

967
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:54,964
In which the rules of
domestic and international law

968
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:57,400
could forever be suspended.

969
00:48:57,402 --> 00:49:01,404
I say permanent and forever
because there is no way

970
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:05,107
to ever fully
eradicate terrorism.

971
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,477
So, the first step
in the war on terrorism

972
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:10,813
is to declare war on...

973
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:20,523
Can I talk to you
for a second?
What?

974
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:23,025
- Can I say something
I'm ashamed of?
- Yeah.

975
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,995
- It's not generous. And I
probably don't really mean it.
- Okay. Go.

976
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,964
- I think Jamie's great.
- Just say it!

977
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:31,133
I can't fucking believe
his idiotic Facebook
idea paid off!

978
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,602
It's so fucking stupid!

979
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:36,906
And my thing is a mess.
It's a total fucking mess.

980
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,043
I'm sorry.
I feel bad saying that.

981
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:44,714
But I also hate the fact
that he's calling his band
Cookie O'Puss.

982
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:46,148
What's wrong with that?

983
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,885
It's just some funny old
kitschy thing to him
he saw on YouTube.

984
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:53,823
But that was my commercial.
I actually experienced it.
You know?

985
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,591
I don't know from Cookie Puss.

986
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,427
Really? It was for Carvel.

987
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:01,797
Cookie Puss was the original
then they did an ice cream
cake for Saint Patrick's Day

988
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:06,702
and it was this floating green
Irish cake that said,
"My name is Cookie O'Puss."

989
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,107
I'm being ridiculous.

990
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,209
I probably don't mean
any of it.

991
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:16,579
My dad likes to say,
"The more, the more."

992
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:20,649
That's because your dad
has everything.
And then he gets more.

993
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,685
He's right. There's enough
to go around for everyone.

994
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:26,222
Joshy! You gotta pitch.
Let's go get you some
hedge fund cash.

995
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,358
Good luck.

996
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,729
Remember, ask him questions.
You're interviewing him.

997
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:35,798
He'd be goddamn lucky
to invest in your film.

998
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,700
- Okay.
- And talk about shit
he understands, see.

999
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,201
Short and to the point.

1000
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:42,004
Ride on the street, man!

1001
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:45,007
Psych him up. Talk about war,
talk about power, race.

1002
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:46,842
- Uh-huh.
- Make it relevant to him.

1003
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:50,312
- Right.
- Be yourself,
everyone else is taken.

1004
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:52,515
Ira was beautiful today.

1005
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,785
We're gonna have a screening
of the cut footage
at the apartment on Friday.

1006
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:58,421
You cut it already?
You just shot it two days ago.

1007
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:00,222
I know. I was up all night.

1008
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,391
We'll be okay, Joshy.
Don't you fret.

1009
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:06,328
Hey, well, maybe
take a day or two
to make sure you like it.

1010
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:10,299
Or I can take 10 years.
I'm fucking with you, Joshy.

1011
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:12,701
Your thing is gonna be
totally brilliant.

1012
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:21,644
I remember when this song
was just considered bad!

1013
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:27,216
Remember, he's lucky
to have this opportunity.
You're friggin' Josh Srebnick.

1014
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,886
My name sounds so much better
when you say it.

1015
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,956
Whoo!

1016
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:41,397
- You see <i> Mad Men?</i>
- No.

1017
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:44,300
- It's really apple juice.
- Nah, it's whiskey.

1018
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,942
- Hmm.
- No, it's not.

1019
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,170
It is.

1020
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:52,808
So, tell me
about your project.

1021
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:56,445
Well, maybe a good way
to start is by asking
you a question.

1022
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,981
Hey, they were all raped
when I got there.

1023
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:03,185
This is my second
in 20 minutes. Shoot.

1024
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:06,989
Do you know the percentage
of African-American adult
males currently in jail?

1025
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:09,191
- I don't.
- Take a guess.

1026
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:10,759
Like 60%?

1027
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:15,064
Jesus, no! It's over 9%.

1028
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:20,002
It's nearly 1-in-10
African-American adult males,
nearly a million and a half.

1029
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:21,270
A million and a half is a lot.

1030
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:24,273
It's insane,
but people don't realize this.

1031
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:26,041
They think because we have
a black president...

1032
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:28,444
- So this is about prison.
- Like a black <i> Shawshank...</i>

1033
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:31,347
- But real.
- No, not... No.

1034
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:33,983
There's a section,
an Entr'acte really,

1035
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:36,118
about the function
of race in the prison
industrial complex...

1036
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,089
But the film is really about
how power works in America.

1037
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:42,191
Do you know the historian,
Ira Mandelstam?

1038
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:43,392
- Yeah.
- Really?

1039
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:45,561
No.

1040
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:48,197
Well, we have over 100
hours of interviews with him.

1041
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,765
The movie's 100 hours?

1042
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:52,701
- No, we'll cut it.
- Phew!

1043
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:55,938
Now, this guy...
He's... He isn't
particularly charismatic,

1044
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,641
he's kind of anti-social,
maybe Asperger's,

1045
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:01,143
but not interesting
Asperger's.

1046
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:04,146
He's kind of boring even. But
he's a charismatic thinker.

1047
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:06,282
How do you show
what he thinks?
Cartoons?

1048
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,118
No, not cartoons. He says it.

1049
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,419
- But he's boring.
- Well, yes.

1050
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:12,388
But as with many
boring things,

1051
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,057
the longer you watch it,
it takes
on a different dimension.

1052
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,793
It's really a very
simple idea.

1053
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:22,498
The three sections correspond
to the three nodes of what
Mills called the power elite.

1054
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,967
The political, military
and economic. But,

1055
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,203
and this is key,
each part has to...

1056
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:29,438
...interconnect to show
how none of three nodes

1057
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,273
functions without the other.

1058
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:35,244
It's a linear film of course,
but I imagine it
as kind of a hypertext.

1059
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,784
So what's it about?

1060
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:43,953
To be clear, the film is
really about the working class

1061
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:46,422
and I can't speak on behalf
of the working class.

1062
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:48,290
I can't make their film,
of course.

1063
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:52,828
But they have to be
felt as the impossible
subject of the text.

1064
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,230
If that makes sense.

1065
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,031
But it isn't even really
about the power structure

1066
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:58,834
but about what it means
to make a film about it.

1067
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:01,237
It's about the very
possibility of making

1068
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,640
this film.
It's really about America.

1069
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,956
Oh, hi.

1070
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,726
Just been working on
my speech for my memorial.

1071
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:26,228
- What's on your mind, son?
- Could you watch what I have?

1072
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,597
I think I'm at the point where
I need a new set of eyes.

1073
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,167
Well, working on the same
project for 10 years
will do that to you.

1074
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:33,435
Yeah.

1075
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:40,476
<i>And the military created
the internet</i>

1076
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:43,545
<i>as part of
an overall strategy.</i>

1077
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:46,982
<i>I'm not just talking about</i>
<i>Google collaborating</i>
<i>with the NSA.</i>

1078
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:49,184
<i>I'm talking about
far deeper...</i>

1079
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,014
Oh!

1080
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,884
I'm gonna put a kettle on.
You want some tea?

1081
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:23,152
Okay.

1082
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,089
Well, you've got a lot
of good material there.

1083
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,558
- Uh-huh.
- Need some time to process it.

1084
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,893
Mmm-hmm.

1085
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,629
Do you need the stuff
about Turkish politics?

1086
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:37,399
Yes, because it connects
to what he's saying
about the shift in power

1087
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,101
in the contemporary
global economy.

1088
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:41,537
All right.
But it feels like a detour.

1089
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:44,306
What about the lengthy
history of the Triangle
shirtwaist factory fire?

1090
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:48,777
The interview with
Tillie Kupferschmidst's
great-great niece?

1091
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:50,746
That's the emotional center
of the movie.

1092
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,781
I mean, that's where
things come together.

1093
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,617
Without that, I don't, I...
I mean, why make the film!

1094
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,854
- Yeah. But it's too long.
- Oh, it has to be long.

1095
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,823
The point is
it makes you uncomfortable.

1096
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:02,825
I wasn't uncomfortable,
I was bored.

1097
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:07,062
Well, maybe the boredom
is your defense
from the discomfort.

1098
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:08,997
You just showed me
a six-and-a-half hour film

1099
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:12,768
that feels like
it's seven hours too long.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

1100
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,670
I think I need to shoot
more interviews.

1101
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:16,338
Don't shoot anymore!
You have enough.

1102
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,007
Yeah, I just don't think
you're getting it or maybe

1103
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:21,877
there's something about me
or what you saw that's
clouding your judgment.

1104
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,113
I'm telling you
how I really feel.

1105
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,648
I don't think so.
I think you're being
deliberately critical.

1106
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,251
- Josh, I'm trying to help you.
- Bullshit!

1107
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:31,320
Is this because Cornelia
and I didn't have children?

1108
00:56:31,322 --> 00:56:32,588
Oh, come on, Josh.

1109
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,958
We tried.
There were miscarriages.

1110
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,261
I had to give her a shot
in her ass every day
for three months.

1111
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:41,063
It's a huge fucking needle.

1112
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:44,266
She didn't tell me that.
I didn't know
you guys wanted kids.

1113
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:48,303
We didn't wanna hope for what
we probably couldn't have.

1114
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:50,606
This was a mistake.

1115
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:52,241
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1116
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:58,080
I know you think
I didn't reach my potential.

1117
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,416
No, son.
I don't think you did.

1118
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,885
Your first film was
wonderful and entertaining.

1119
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,087
We could see ourselves in it.

1120
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:08,157
This one feels ungenerous,
it's like you took your ball
and went home.

1121
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:10,659
You know what? I'm sorry
I didn't become you.

1122
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,195
- I don't want you
to become me.
- Yeah, right.

1123
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,730
I'll see you at Thanksgiving.

1124
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:17,199
Yeah, I'm not going
to eat another
fucking fried turkey, FYI.

1125
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,867
Then bring your own!

1126
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,205
Yoshy! There is my other half.

1127
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:31,607
You invited Breitbart?

1128
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:34,276
Yeah, he called me
after you introduced us.

1129
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:37,179
- He called you?
- Yeah, and at our dinner
I invited him to tonight.

1130
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,814
When did you have dinner?

1131
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:41,416
- After he called me,
he suggested we get dinner.
- Uh-huh. Where'd you go?

1132
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:43,852
This really incredible joint,
um, on the Upper West Side.

1133
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,587
- Jackson Hole.
- Yeah! How'd you know?

1134
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,056
- That's where he goes.
- Great burgers.
Have you been there?

1135
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,525
Yes, I've been there
with him a million times.

1136
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,793
- Have you tried
the Bison Burger?
- Of course!

1137
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:53,428
He dug the footage.

1138
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,865
Is something wrong?

1139
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:00,836
I guess I wish you'd asked me
before you just went to him.

1140
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:03,071
Hey, I'm sorry.
I called him actually
just to ask him a question

1141
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:05,807
about how he shot something
and we got to talking, see,

1142
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,309
and he asked me
what I was working on...

1143
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:08,610
- So, you called him?
- What?

1144
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,852
- You said he called you.
- He called me back, yeah.

1145
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,348
Does Cornelia know?

1146
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,617
Very cool! Very cool.

1147
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,689
- I'm proud to be a part of it.
- Dave, you know Josh.

1148
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:24,993
Nice to meet you.
Seriously dude,
this movie is kill-ah.

1149
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:28,564
We're going to Afghanistan,
we're going to Afghanistan...

1150
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,402
You're going to Afghanistan?

1151
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,003
To interview soldiers
in Kent's unit.

1152
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:37,606
We've got a butt-load
of work to do before we go.
I'm gonna need help.

1153
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:40,175
We're going to Afghanistan...

1154
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,311
Come on.

1155
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,281
Um, if you have
any other editing work,

1156
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,717
my guy Tim is great
and could use some cash.

1157
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,485
- That would be beautiful.
- Yo, come with me.

1158
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,768
I want you to meet Diane,
she's a reporter
from <i> The Times.</i>

1159
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,690
I'll text you his info.

1160
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,025
Do you forget that I exist?

1161
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,493
No, I don't forget you exist.

1162
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:00,095
I asked you for a beer
like a half hour ago.

1163
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,097
Why don't you just
give me a minute, okay?

1164
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,399
You're such
an asshole.

1165
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,046
Ahhh!

1166
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,182
I've been looking for you.

1167
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:21,750
You're smoking?

1168
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:25,220
What's going on? What is...
This is like
a fucking bad dream.

1169
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:27,456
Everyone here is
doing weird shit.

1170
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:30,993
Where's my high school
algebra teacher, Mr. Morelli
riding a fucking turtle?

1171
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:34,730
I had no idea Dad was coming.
I saw him when I got here.

1172
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:37,666
Are you sure? Are you sure
you're not just saying that?

1173
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:39,901
Yes, Josh!
Why would I lie to you?

1174
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:43,538
Do you think that Jamie came
to my class because he knew
that I was married to you?

1175
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,540
That this was all
so he could meet your dad?

1176
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,977
Josh, you know,
the world isn't
a conspiracy against you.

1177
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,379
You know, fuck you.

1178
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:52,214
Fuck you.
Don't talk to me like that.

1179
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:54,449
I'm saying "fuck you" the way
Jamie and Darby say it

1180
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:57,085
where it's not a real
"fuck you," it's
a semi-playful "fuck you."

1181
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:59,388
We're not Jamie and Darby.
We don't talk to
each other that way.

1182
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,923
If you say fuck you to me
it feels like a real fuck you.

1183
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:05,227
- It is real.
- Fuck you. And not
semi-playfully either!

1184
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:08,864
Fuck you. Total real, cutting
to the core, fuck you.

1185
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,148
Darby? Are you okay?

1186
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,318
Shit's bad.

1187
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,621
You wanna get some goat?

1188
01:01:32,623 --> 01:01:36,024
Crushes fade. Things lose
their luster, you know?

1189
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,794
Maybe I'm just down
on relationships right now.

1190
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:41,697
- What about Jamie?
- Jamie's in love with Jamie.

1191
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,700
But you guys seemed great.

1192
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:48,437
You know how no one
will ever pick up
just a male hitchhiker?

1193
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:51,940
But if it's a couple,
you might pull over?

1194
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:55,744
Well, I'm the girl so you'll
pull over and pick up Jamie.

1195
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:59,614
Doing Ayahuasca, I realized

1196
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:03,051
I never forgave my mom
for dying

1197
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,153
and until I do

1198
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:08,256
I'll never have a decent
relationship with a guy.

1199
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,492
- When did she die?
- When I was in high school.

1200
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,694
She had ovarian cancer.

1201
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,565
I'm sorry.

1202
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,401
Isn't that also
how Jamie's mom died?

1203
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,670
He talked about it
in the film.

1204
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:25,073
Why'd you let Jamie
use your scholar?

1205
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:30,512
I was trying out
being generous.

1206
01:02:30,514 --> 01:02:34,049
He'd do the same for me.
That's how you guys are.

1207
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:35,884
Oh, Josh!

1208
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:39,354
You're such a man-fox.

1209
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:41,790
A man-fox?

1210
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:44,226
I wish it didn't need
the "man" qualifier.

1211
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:46,595
Because you're like a hot dad.

1212
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,531
Without children.

1213
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,606
We shouldn't.

1214
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:02,978
This is the part where I say,
"I was a bet!"

1215
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,181
- What?
- You know those romantic
comedies when

1216
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,083
the girl is a bet?

1217
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:11,153
Yeah. Just because they did,
doesn't mean we have to.

1218
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:13,822
What... What do you mean?

1219
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:17,726
She never told you?
Jamie and Cornelia
made out at the Ayahuasca.

1220
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:20,295
It was in the papyrus reeds
behind the pyramids.

1221
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,801
I'm sorry, I stole
one of Tipper's Adderalls.

1222
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:29,204
- Do you wanna go dancing?
- Yeah.

1223
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:31,673
I'm not going home tonight.

1224
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,526
Thanks for meeting me
so early. We've got
a butt-load to do.

1225
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:54,062
Dave needs a budget
for Afghanistan.

1226
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:55,330
I'm almost finished with it.

1227
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,966
I've been reading a lot about
Afghanistan. It's crazy.

1228
01:03:57,968 --> 01:04:00,769
You know no one has ever
been able to successfully
occupy Afghanistan.

1229
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:06,308
I think we got something now.
With your help, it can really
be something.

1230
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,310
Leslie's notes were beautiful.

1231
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:10,011
He's smart that way.

1232
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,214
And really chill
to kick it with.

1233
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,652
I'm sorry, I...

1234
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:23,225
Josh and I had a fight
last night and he didn't
come home.

1235
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,160
Hey.

1236
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,130
Hey, hey.

1237
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:35,036
It's going to be okay.
Joshy will come back.

1238
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,206
Thank you.

1239
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,442
Ugh! I'm sorry I'm like this.

1240
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:42,177
Hey, no worries.

1241
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,549
I was thinking, maybe you
and your dad would wanna
work on my thing together.

1242
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,785
He seems to
wanna get involved.

1243
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:53,455
It might be kind
of great, right?

1244
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:57,359
I mean, you're producing,
but he could
bless it essentially.

1245
01:04:57,361 --> 01:05:00,095
Bless it? Like a sneeze?

1246
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:02,097
No. I was thinking
more like the Pope.

1247
01:05:03,634 --> 01:05:05,734
He doesn't really do
that kind of thing.

1248
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,936
Well, I think if you
asked him, he might.

1249
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,907
Did you ever see <i> Power Elite?</i>

1250
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:13,008
What's that?

1251
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,344
Josh's movie! God damn, yes.

1252
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:18,513
I told him that.
I loved that scene
with the dogs.

1253
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:23,151
When you went to Josh's class,
you knew Josh and I
were married, didn't you?

1254
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:24,786
And that Leslie was my dad.

1255
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,724
Hey, I admire lots of people.
I want lots of things.

1256
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:34,429
You know what I mean.
We all want stuff. It doesn't
mean we're douche bags.

1257
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:37,899
You're a hip chick.
You kissed me, you're married
to my friend, but I get it.

1258
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:39,501
I thought you were Josh.

1259
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:41,002
The first time.

1260
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:48,076
You know, but out of context,
if other people
heard about it,

1261
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:50,245
it might be misconstrued.

1262
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,289
Where were you last night?

1263
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,692
I was dancing with Darby
in an after-hours gay club.

1264
01:06:03,694 --> 01:06:05,093
Is this some kind
of a private meeting?

1265
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:07,796
- Did you follow me here?
- I follow him on Twitter!

1266
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:09,764
We can't lie like we used
to lie anymore.

1267
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:11,800
Everything's reported.
Nothing is private.

1268
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:14,669
- There's nothing going on.
- Don't lie to me.
You kissed him.

1269
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:17,439
- I know all about it.
- I thought he was you, Joshy.

1270
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:20,375
Don't call me Joshy!
You don't call me Joshy.

1271
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,577
- Sorry.
- It's all a pose.

1272
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:26,881
It's like he once saw
a sincere person and has been
imitating him ever since!

1273
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:29,651
- And you're falling for it.
- I didn't even like them!

1274
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,753
You convinced me
how awesome they were.

1275
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:35,890
They're entitled little brats.
And don't you see,
it's all a plan.

1276
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:37,892
He's trying to destroy me.

1277
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,495
Go back inside!

1278
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:41,997
You know what!
You and your father
can have him.

1279
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:44,766
You always wanted a more
successful me, so go for it.

1280
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:50,005
I didn't know when we got
married that you'd wanna play
kissy face with 25-year-olds.

1281
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:53,775
I didn't know that either and
I didn't know that you'd
never finish your movie.

1282
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:56,044
I'm gonna finish it!
I just need to get it right.

1283
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:59,214
It's obsession. It's fear.
I don't know
what it is. It's...

1284
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,951
Please?
Will you go back inside?

1285
01:07:02,953 --> 01:07:04,986
It's not really
about making anything.

1286
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:06,888
At least Jamie
makes something.

1287
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:09,157
Do not compare
what I do with him.

1288
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:12,427
Why not? When you felt
a part of it, you loved it.

1289
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:15,830
And you use your movie as an
excuse not to do anything.

1290
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:19,834
We don't go on vacations,
we don't make decisions,
we don't have kids.

1291
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:23,304
- I want a kid.
- But you want it now
that it's impossible.

1292
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:26,441
- It's not impossible.
- No. It's over. It's done.

1293
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:30,245
I'm not putting myself
through that anymore.
This is closed.

1294
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,796
Marina's at a work dinner.

1295
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:51,032
- They're both top-sheets,
but... You know.
- Thanks.

1296
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:54,803
Ah, you might wake up
when I come through for
Willow's 2:00 a.m. feeding.

1297
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:58,106
And the 5:00 a.m. feeding.
And then all the other times
she wakes up.

1298
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:00,208
That's okay. How is she?

1299
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:04,012
Cool baby. But to be honest...

1300
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,283
It's a little hard for me
to relate to an infant.

1301
01:08:08,285 --> 01:08:10,318
It seems kind of cool though.

1302
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,489
It's like the pregnancy
is its own thing.
You get so used to it.

1303
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:18,793
After a while I just felt
like, we did this, we don't
actually need the baby.

1304
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,599
I'm sorry if I've appeared
crazy or... I don't know.

1305
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:28,870
I'm sorry we didn't invite you
to the party.

1306
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:31,539
I think I've been jealous
of you guys having a kid...

1307
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,776
Ah, you know...

1308
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,911
Before you have a kid,
everyone tells you,

1309
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:38,947
"It's the best thing
you'll ever do."

1310
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,915
And as soon as you
get the baby back
from the hospital,

1311
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:44,185
those same people are like,
"Don't worry, it gets better."

1312
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:46,454
I'm like, what the fuck
was all that before?

1313
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:51,359
But having Willow must've
changed your whole
perspective on life.

1314
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:54,462
Not as much
as I hoped it would.

1315
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:58,700
I, I love my baby
but I'm still the most
important person in my life.

1316
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:06,341
Hey, did I tell you
I have a herniated disk,
L5 or some shit.

1317
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:08,109
I'm getting an epidural
on Monday.

1318
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:10,111
I have arthritis in my knees.

1319
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,794
What the fuck
is happening to us?

1320
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,392
Hey.

1321
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:25,560
Hi.

1322
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:28,296
Hey, man.

1323
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,733
I'm sorry
about not paying you.

1324
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,102
Yeah.

1325
01:09:34,104 --> 01:09:37,172
I mean, I hoped the money
would come in, it didn't.

1326
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,874
I kind of fudged that.

1327
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:44,279
I just can't work for nothing,
you know?

1328
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:48,116
But thanks for hooking me
up with Jamie. I've been
freelancing a bit for him.

1329
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:53,821
If you're not too busy there,
I wanted to hire you back
for a couple of weeks.

1330
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,857
- I can pay you.
- Did the grant money come in?

1331
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:59,027
No, I sold all my CDs.

1332
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:02,997
And some other things.

1333
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:05,300
Leslie suggested
we cut the bit
about Turkish politics.

1334
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:06,568
But I told him it was crucial
because of...

1335
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,803
I think it's a good idea.

1336
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:11,839
- Yeah?
- Yeah. We got
to cut something.

1337
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,243
Okay, let's give it a try.

1338
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,912
<i>I've been unhappy...</i>

1339
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:22,116
Oh, this is Jamie's footage.
Some stuff I was working on.

1340
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:24,652
- Wait.
- What?

1341
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:27,455
- Hold on that image of Kent.
- Okay.

1342
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,825
Blow it up.

1343
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:32,627
I can't do that
on this machine.

1344
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:33,728
Really?

1345
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,129
No.

1346
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,499
That's Darby's ice cream.

1347
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:41,469
It looks like mint
of some kind.

1348
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:45,006
It's avocado. Darby was there
before we were.

1349
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:46,808
I got my first response
on Facebook.

1350
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,277
This guy, Kent Arlington.
I haven't seen him since
high school in Santa Cruz.

1351
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:50,912
You said we should be
open to surprises, right?

1352
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,047
I just Googled Kent.
Did you Google him?
He was in Afghanistan.

1353
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:54,115
Really?

1354
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:55,750
My mom was really sick
with ovarian cancer.

1355
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,152
- When I was in high school,
she had ovarian cancer.
- Isn't that also...

1356
01:10:58,154 --> 01:11:01,022
Thank God I've got you, Joshy!
We do what you said.
We didn't know the answers.

1357
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,357
We discovered them.

1358
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:05,927
Don't you see? She brought
Kent the ice cream.

1359
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:11,666
I know Jamie's
your friend, but

1360
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:14,002
to be honest,
he's kind of a prick.

1361
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,698
Hey. Is Kent here?

1362
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,537
Is everything okay?

1363
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,439
My son turns nine today.

1364
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:53,708
Oh, happy birthday.

1365
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,868
You're so intense.
I'm focusing.

1366
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:24,639
There.

1367
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,243
Thank you.

1368
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:33,247
You know looking back
at my career, I wonder
how did I accomplish so much?

1369
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:37,418
If I'm honest with myself,
it sometimes took
being a selfish prick

1370
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,487
at the expense of you
and your mother.

1371
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:43,224
Of course, I don't say that.
I say talent, work, luck.

1372
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:46,227
Your husband doesn't realize
what it takes, he...

1373
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:48,262
He still believes
the speeches.

1374
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:52,066
You know, when I first started
dating him, he reminded me
so much of you.

1375
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:55,803
He wants what I have,
but he's not merciless
enough to get it.

1376
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,977
I learned magic from a dude,
Elvin, over in Afghanistan.

1377
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:06,114
- He was shredded
by a land mine.
- Oh, that's terrible.

1378
01:13:06,116 --> 01:13:10,718
I'm more old-fashioned in my
approach. I don't lock myself
up in a box or anything,

1379
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,487
it's mostly cards and balls.

1380
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:14,889
I learned from watching
videos on YouTube.

1381
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,724
It keeps me from
going out of my head.

1382
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:20,595
Yeah, we need distractions.
For me, it's the internet.

1383
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:22,330
I'm trying to go on less,
you know.

1384
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:24,932
You know, it's like
how many times can I check
<i>The Huffington Post?</i>

1385
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:26,768
How did you fucking do that?

1386
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:28,870
- Louis!
- Sorry.

1387
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:31,806
So, what made you contact
Jamie on Facebook?

1388
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:33,441
What do you mean?

1389
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:34,942
What made you
reach out to him?

1390
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:38,646
I didn't. He contacted me.
Here, you got something.

1391
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:41,883
Other side.
I had no idea who he was.

1392
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,786
- Really?
- Yeah. He said that

1393
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:47,121
- he lived with Darby.
- You remember Darby?

1394
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:49,957
Yeah, Darby's been a friend
for years.

1395
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,693
We'd Skype sometimes
when I was in Kandahar.

1396
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:56,330
The reception was really
shitty though, it'd freeze
up all the time.

1397
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:58,299
Did she know about...

1398
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,469
That you were
in the hospital.

1399
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:02,770
Who are you again?

1400
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:05,339
I'm Jamie's cameraman.

1401
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:07,008
And why are you
asking me this stuff?

1402
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:11,012
- I'm fact-checking the movie.
- Uh-huh.

1403
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:14,081
- Hey! Bring that back,
you fuckers!
- Kent!

1404
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,284
What did you think
when Jamie started talking

1405
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:19,420
about Darby's childhood
as if it was his own?

1406
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:21,856
He said that
he was playing a part.

1407
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:25,259
He said that when?

1408
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:28,830
He called me a week
or so before you guys
came up and filmed me.

1409
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:31,632
Can you say that again?

1410
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:38,606
Josh, it's me, again.
I just...

1411
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:42,477
I, I am so sorry.

1412
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:47,315
I hope you come
to my dad's thing.
He'd like it and I'd like it.

1413
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:53,488
And I'm so sorry
for all the things
we said and...

1414
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,924
<i>Can you come?
Can you call me back, please?</i>

1415
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:58,226
<i>Where are you, Josh?</i>

1416
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,038
- I've got to talk to Jamie!
- He's not here.

1417
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,376
- You going somewhere?
- Tampa.

1418
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:17,845
If I stay here any longer,
I'll <i> Girl, Interrupt.</i>

1419
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:20,314
I was just with Kent.

1420
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:24,652
Oh, Kent! I love Kent.

1421
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:27,054
I saw your ice cream
in Jamie's video.

1422
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,492
Well played, sir.

1423
01:15:31,494 --> 01:15:35,296
He let me think
I was the one who found out
about Kent in Afghanistan.

1424
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:37,999
Jamie doesn't wanna
disappoint you.

1425
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:41,102
None of us wanna
disappoint you.
You're such a purist.

1426
01:15:41,104 --> 01:15:44,038
Jamie would never have made
the movie without Afghanistan.

1427
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,774
When I told him about Kent
and the massacre,

1428
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:48,409
he thought it would
make a good movie.

1429
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:50,211
He just had to figure out
how to tell it.

1430
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,746
But why not tell it honestly?

1431
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:53,548
It's more entertaining
this way.

1432
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:57,885
And now it has a before
and after which, as you know,
Americans love.

1433
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:00,354
People have to know.
He can't get away with this.

1434
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:02,456
Jamie does whatever he wants.

1435
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,992
This goes against everything
he said he admired in me.

1436
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:07,762
The whole principle
of making a doc.

1437
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:11,566
Darby, you don't understand.
This is fraud.
It's a big deal.

1438
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,434
People are jailed
for this kind of thing.

1439
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:15,836
I don't like to meddle
with people.

1440
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:18,005
If they're gonna change,
they'll change.

1441
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:19,507
Where is he?

1442
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:21,876
He's at your
father-in-law's tribute.

1443
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:24,946
Oh, shit! That was now!

1444
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:27,915
And I returned the rental car.
I'm a mess.

1445
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:31,077
I can give you a jacket.
And you can take
Jamie's roller blades.

1446
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,521
Thanks.

1447
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:37,391
You know, me and Jamie
always wondered
how are we gonna get old.

1448
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:39,827
And the answer is...

1449
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:41,829
Just like everyone else.

1450
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,507
- What is your name?
- Jamie Massey.

1451
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:56,469
Jamie Massey, okay.
Jamie Massey, everyone,
Jamie Massey.

1452
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:19,700
Jeez Louise. I've never been
to a rat fuck like this.

1453
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:21,582
- Did you see Patti Smith?
- Where?

1454
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,474
Can I get a Shirley Temple?

1455
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,943
What're you doing, dude?

1456
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:05,780
- Can I stand here
for a second?
- No.

1457
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:07,715
- What can I get you, sir?
- Shirley Temple.

1458
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:09,450
No problem. Right this way.

1459
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,227
<i>Looking, listening.</i>

1460
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,863
<i>These are simple enough acts,
are they not?</i>

1461
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:26,467
<i>We don't need any</i>
<i>instruction on how to</i>
<i>use our eyes and ears.</i>

1462
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:30,104
<i>Or we don't think we do</i>
<i>until we see</i>
<i>a Leslie Brietbart film.</i>

1463
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,383
Yosh?

1464
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,252
You okay?

1465
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:48,422
<i>My friend, Leslie Brietbart.</i>

1466
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:56,430
<i>I've been thinking of tonight
as my memorial for so long,</i>

1467
01:18:56,432 --> 01:19:01,335
<i>I had completely forgotten</i>
<i>that I actually had to</i>
<i>be alive for it.</i>

1468
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,805
Is that my jacket?

1469
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,541
Are those my blades?

1470
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:11,545
Are they? Who knows?

1471
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:14,949
Maybe they're Darby's.
Darby's, yours, mine.

1472
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,520
- Cookie O'Puss.
- Where have you been?
Everyone's asking about you.

1473
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:21,322
I was in Poughkeepsie.

1474
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,225
Okay.

1475
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:26,994
It seems like you made
a whole lot of stuff up.

1476
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:29,764
<i>Now people have criticized me
and some of my colleagues</i>

1477
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:35,703
<i>saying that we were</i>
<i>pretending to be objective</i>
<i>when there is no objectivity.</i>

1478
01:19:35,705 --> 01:19:39,373
<i>Okay, we were trying
to capture truth,</i>

1479
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,976
<i>but the truth of experience...</i>

1480
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:44,578
I don't wanna miss his speech.

1481
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:48,215
You know, it's your
responsibility to be honest.

1482
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:49,483
People are gonna believe it.

1483
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:50,885
I didn't do anything
nobody else does.

1484
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:52,686
"I didn't do anything
nobody else..."

1485
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:55,990
You reveal everything
and nothing.

1486
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:58,058
You said you wanted
to be a real documentarian.

1487
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,326
I do.

1488
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:01,162
I thought you were
about process.

1489
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:04,565
Process and ice cream.

1490
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:07,268
But you really will do
anything to be successful.

1491
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,203
Success isn't my thing, Josh.
It's yours.

1492
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:10,905
Yeah, you're right,
it is my thing.

1493
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:13,374
I've got a fucked up
relationship with success.

1494
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:15,409
I want it and I don't have it.

1495
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:18,279
But what you have
scares the shit out of me.

1496
01:20:18,281 --> 01:20:20,281
<i>What we were trying
to say as filmmakers</i>

1497
01:20:20,283 --> 01:20:25,452
<i>is that what we were filming</i>
<i>was more interesting</i>
<i>than we were.</i>

1498
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,488
<i>We weren't trying
to be objective.</i>

1499
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,857
You're not
uncomfortable at all.

1500
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:31,692
Why should I be uncomfortable?

1501
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:33,460
See, that I just find weird.

1502
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:35,596
You're the only one
who is weird about this.

1503
01:20:35,598 --> 01:20:37,031
I asked you to co-direct.

1504
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:39,533
Yeah, because you knew
I'd say, "No!"

1505
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:44,004
<i>We were trying to be open</i>
<i>and to learn from the people</i>
<i>we were filming.</i>

1506
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,507
Jeez, Joshy. Everyone does
this kind of thing.

1507
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:49,910
I don't. I don't do
something like this.

1508
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:52,012
I'm trying to make movies
to figure out the truth.

1509
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,948
- Really?
- Yes!

1510
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:57,718
<i>We saw truth not through
telling you what we thought,</i>

1511
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,455
<i>but through a different
ethical approach to filmmaking</i>

1512
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:06,060
<i>that allowed the world
to reveal itself to us.</i>

1513
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:08,362
I do know that
documentaries are over.

1514
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,431
Are you kidding?
It's what everyone is doing.

1515
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:13,167
His documentaries are over.
What you're doing
is something else.

1516
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:16,570
If everyone is filming
everything,
what's a documentary anymore?

1517
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:20,608
It has no meaning,
it's just some shit
you recorded!

1518
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:23,711
Is that old man talk?
Maybe it is.

1519
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,015
You kids have been told
you can do anything.

1520
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,853
You think everything
is out there for you to have.
It's not.

1521
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:36,957
Nobody owns anything.
If I hear a song I like,
or a story, it's mine.

1522
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:38,492
It's mine to use.
It's everybody's.

1523
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:41,562
No, it isn't!
That's not sharing, Jamie,
that's stealing.

1524
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:44,231
- That's old man talk.
- I am an old man!

1525
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:50,204
I can't let Cornelia and
Leslie walk down this road
with you.

1526
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:53,607
I want you to go in there
and tell them
what you've done.

1527
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:57,511
If you won't do it,
I'll do it for you.

1528
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:02,349
Okay.

1529
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,986
<i>What else can I tell you?</i>

1530
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:09,723
<i>After all these years,</i>
<i>I still don't have</i>
<i>all the answers.</i>

1531
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:13,193
<i>And for the sake
of documentary cinema,</i>

1532
01:22:13,195 --> 01:22:16,964
<i>I intend to leave it that way.</i>
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for this tribute.</i>

1533
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,372
You know, it's just the way...

1534
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,274
- Josh!
- Sorry, I'm late.

1535
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,176
Leslie, I caught your speech
from the lobby, though

1536
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:31,478
and it was really inspiring,
spot on.

1537
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,113
Are you okay, son?
Do you wanna sit down?

1538
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:36,150
Jamie has something
he wants to tell all of you.

1539
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:37,785
Go ahead.

1540
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:40,087
Not all of the stuff
in my movie happened
exactly as I said it did.

1541
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:41,855
I played around
with some of the timeline.

1542
01:22:41,857 --> 01:22:42,923
Okay.

1543
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:46,226
- Yeah...
- "Yeah?" And...

1544
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:47,361
And what?

1545
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,298
You did a lot more
than that, come on.

1546
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,101
He didn't even know Kent.
Darby did.

1547
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:56,270
Darby's mother
died of ovarian cancer.

1548
01:22:56,272 --> 01:22:59,073
Jamie's mom is probably
alive and kicking in Idaho.

1549
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:01,108
Josh, this is kind
of my night.

1550
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,344
- You just need to hear this.
- That's basically it.

1551
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:06,814
That's not basically it!
You knew that Kent
had tried to kill himself.

1552
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:08,048
- Right.
- Say it!

1553
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,583
Josh, let him speak.

1554
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:12,720
The gist is the same.
I authored a bit
of how I came to it.

1555
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:16,256
I mean,
I'm not that good a writer.

1556
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:18,425
If I made it all up, I'd be
the best writer in Hollywood

1557
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:20,961
and, and Kent would be
Marlon Brando.

1558
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:22,997
I never said it was amazing.
I just said it was faked.

1559
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:24,365
And some of the timeline
was adjusted...

1560
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:25,866
Would you stop
with the timeline crap?

1561
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:27,968
Jamie knew that Kent
had tried to kill himself.

1562
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:31,739
That he'd been in Afghanistan.
We didn't just stumble
upon it. It was rigged.

1563
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:34,942
Jamie invented the whole
Facebook thing because
he knew it would play better.

1564
01:23:34,944 --> 01:23:38,345
- Kent wasn't in Afghanistan?
- No, Kent was in Afghanistan.

1565
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,614
- So, what's the problem?
- It's...

1566
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:44,385
It's the way... The way
that he said that
he found him is not true.

1567
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:46,420
Kent served our country,
you're being offensive.

1568
01:23:46,422 --> 01:23:48,022
Is what Josh is saying true?

1569
01:23:48,024 --> 01:23:51,191
Well... I did know,
but I don't think
it really matters though,

1570
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:52,493
the movie's not about that.

1571
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:55,696
Of course it matters.
Leslie, explain.

1572
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:58,732
- I don't know that it totally
matters in this case.
- What?

1573
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:00,567
- I don't care.
- I didn't expect you to care.

1574
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:03,303
Leslie, are you kidding me?
You don't care?

1575
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:05,639
You just gave a speech
about authenticity!

1576
01:24:05,641 --> 01:24:08,142
The movie works
on so many levels,

1577
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:11,879
the happenstance of it,
to be honest with you,
is the least interesting part.

1578
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:15,315
I can't believe it!
This movie isn't worth the

1579
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:16,984
RAM it's stored on.

1580
01:24:16,986 --> 01:24:19,553
He's a con artist, Leslie.

1581
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:23,123
Your generation of sit-ins,
and protesters and

1582
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:26,427
pack rats would be horrified
by this demon!

1583
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:28,710
- Josh, you're hysterical.
- I'm not hysterical! I'm...

1584
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:32,366
Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1585
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,203
Cornelia?

1586
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:38,972
I don't know.

1587
01:24:38,974 --> 01:24:42,643
I think he's an asshole,
but the movie's pretty good.

1588
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:44,912
And I'm sorry I think that.

1589
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:47,414
This is so frustrating!
This...

1590
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:49,783
I'm going to get
no satisfaction here, am I?

1591
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:52,319
This guy's just gonna win
no matter what.

1592
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:54,054
This is not
how the world works.

1593
01:24:54,056 --> 01:24:57,925
Why does it have to be
one thing or another?
Things change.

1594
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:59,426
Different things matter now.

1595
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:02,996
Okay, forget ethics then.
What about me?

1596
01:25:02,998 --> 01:25:04,331
You played me.

1597
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,833
But you acted in it.

1598
01:25:05,835 --> 01:25:08,368
Only because
I thought it was real!

1599
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,175
I loved you.

1600
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:19,346
I really like you too.
We're friends.

1601
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,649
I really believed it.

1602
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:28,755
I was a bet!

1603
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:35,496
- Are you okay, son?
- I'm not crying. I'm not.

1604
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:43,770
- Are you filming this?
- Josh, your sleeve is on fire.

1605
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,540
Ahhh!

1606
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,021
I took your note by the way.

1607
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:04,191
I cut the stuff
about Turkish politics.

1608
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,293
You were right,
I don't need it.

1609
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:07,995
Glad to hear that, son.

1610
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:18,739
It doesn't matter
that it was faked

1611
01:26:18,741 --> 01:26:22,242
because the movie isn't
about Afghanistan or Kent,

1612
01:26:22,244 --> 01:26:25,879
or anyone,
it's all about Jamie.

1613
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:31,318
In my head, when I was
blading over, I swept in
and exposed everything.

1614
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,420
I was such a hero.

1615
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:37,758
Thanks.

1616
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:44,631
I wanted so badly...

1617
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,736
I wanted to be admired.

1618
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:54,841
- I wanted a protege.
- I know.

1619
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:59,346
He looked at me like
I was a real grown-up person.

1620
01:26:59,348 --> 01:27:05,252
For the first time in my life,
I stopped thinking of myself
as a child imitating an adult.

1621
01:27:05,254 --> 01:27:06,887
You feel that way too?

1622
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:12,426
I'm 44 and there are
things I will never do.

1623
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,330
Things I won't have.

1624
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:21,201
What's the opposite
of "the world is your oyster?"

1625
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:27,341
I wish we could just go back
and meet each other
all over again.

1626
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:32,346
I'd present
myself differently.

1627
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:33,814
So I didn't get your hopes up.

1628
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:42,656
I think it's hard for me
to have something great
every day

1629
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:44,391
and to acknowledge it.

1630
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:51,365
I have something great
every day.

1631
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,939
If we were different people,

1632
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:02,209
I'd ask you to renew our vows.

1633
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,380
I think it's nice
to renew vows.

1634
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:10,817
Maybe we are different people.

1635
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,447
Call when you get there!

1636
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:41,581
We will, Fox.

1637
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:43,650
You're gonna be
such great parents.

1638
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,972
Hey, the guy is waving at us.
We gotta go, Marina!
They changed the rules.

1639
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:48,322
Bye, Willow!

1640
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:49,690
We'll be back in a week.

1641
01:28:49,692 --> 01:28:51,558
Fox, I'm gonna cry.

1642
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,126
The cop's coming, Marina.
We gotta go.

1643
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:55,228
Send pictures
of the little man.
We love you guys.

1644
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:56,797
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

1645
01:28:56,799 --> 01:29:00,934
I love you too, but I'm not
getting arrested for you.
Marina!

1646
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,308
Oh! Thanks.

1647
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:11,912
- You really need 10?
- It's four hours
to Port-au-Prince.

1648
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:19,353
- I can't believe it.
- Me neither.

1649
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,431
Look who it is!

1650
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:41,308
<i>Well, I'm of</i>
<i>a certain age</i>
<i>and I wear tight jeans.</i>

1651
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:44,611
It's out there.
The evil is unleashed.

1652
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:49,549
No, you were right,
he's not evil.

1653
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,420
He's just young.

1654
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,691
Mmm.
