1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,631
To ho chi minh, vietnam.

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,426
At the airport, a "Big brother"
Alliance was born.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,928
No u-turns.

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,598
In vietnam, they felt the
Pressure.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,101
I think the exhaustion has
Hit us.

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:26,184
While corinne and
Eliza felt the pain.

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,279
Teams sang all the way to the
Top.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,283
You're team number one.

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,576
Meanwhile, bret crashed at.

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:38,413
, but he and krista
Survived the leg.

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:42,625
I am pleased to tell you this is
A non-elimination round.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,002
Nine teams remain.

13
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,462
Who will be eliminated?

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,631
We're in a race for $1 Million.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,174
Next?

16
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:55,221
I was made for this.

17
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,310
Let's do this.

18
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,813
Make you way.

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,190
What?

20
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:09,152
Snow town, saigon.

21
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,946
This is vietnam's
Biggest city, ho chi minh, a.

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,450
City that never sleeps, and
Where more than seven million.

23
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,659
Motorbikes rule the road.

24
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,371
After making their way through
These busy streets, teams will.

25
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,166
Get to cool down in snow town,
Saigon.

26
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,375
Going to know town.

27
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,171
We're just excited to start
This leg in first place.

28
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,382
We're looking the stay at
The top.

29
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:37,472
Snow town, saigon, do you
Know it?

30
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,141
Let's keep this lead, baby.

31
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:44,479
How do you say "Fast"?

32
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,356
On our way to snow town.

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,359
I wish I could find our taxi
Driver from last night.

34
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,529
So two second-place finishes.

35
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,321
I feel like we're coming into
Our own.

36
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,198
Taxi!

37
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,281
Taxi!

38
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,159
Dammit.

39
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:06,243
But I think we're teeter
Tottering between an "Amazing."

40
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,737
Race" team and "Big brother"
Team.

41
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:12,257
I think we need to survive a
U-turn or something to be called.

42
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,715
An "Amazing race" team.

43
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,551
This is exciting.

44
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,761
I like being a little bit ahead.

45
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,512
Snow town.

46
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,388
Snow town.

47
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,556
All right.

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,351
We kind of like being at the
Top of the pack but not.

49
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,519
Necessarily number one.

50
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,772
I think it keeps a little bit of
A target off of our back.

51
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:32,235
We're just like mom and dad
Coming to play with all the.

52
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,504
Young millennials with their big
Followings.

53
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,407
Just get into that final three
And give everything we've got on.

54
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,950
That last leg to try to win it.

55
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,494
Snow town, saigon.

56
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,556
We've been racing through asia
The last three legs.

57
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,749
I think we're ready to cool down
A bit.

58
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,917
We look cute in layers.

59
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:53,756
I will say it, I'm about to
Give them snow town princess

60
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,008
Elsa demure fabulousness.

61
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:59,637
We're leaving in fifth place,
Our best yet, to right there in.

62
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,847
Average mediocrity.

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,767
Is there anything we can improve
Upon from the last leg other.

64
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:10,106
Than, I don't know...

65
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,357
I don't know.

66
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,945
We really want the hang in
There to show that survivors can.

67
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,071
Race, too.

68
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,575
It seems idiotic that we
Couldn't be better at this than.

69
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,201
"Big brother."

70
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:22,994
taxi!

71
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:23,953
Taxi!

72
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,954
Taxi!

73
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,456
What's up?

74
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,001
He didn't stop.

75
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,630
Why hasn't a single "Big
Brother" team been eliminated.

76
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,589
Here's us.

77
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,635
Why are we not better at this
Than they are?

78
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,761
Let's do this.

79
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,929
Going to snow town.

80
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,846
Wait.

81
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,556
What's that say?

82
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,016
630 a.M.

83
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,142
yeah.

84
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:46,476
630.

85
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,438
No.

86
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,608
Nicole and victor just got Here.

87
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,361
Everyone is going to be here.

88
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:02,742
I guess we can juggle.

89
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,954
Come on.

90
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,037
Go, go.

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,206
Let's go.

92
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:08,957
Hurry.

93
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,334
Run, baby, run.

94
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,168
I'm going.

95
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,336
Snow town!

96
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,965
You're going to want to
Do it, man.

97
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,177
Don't injure yourself.

98
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,720
What's up, polar bear?

99
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,347
This place is ridiculous.

100
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,017
Elf found.

101
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,810
Jiminy christmas.

102
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:29,477
There's sleds here.

103
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,229
There's sleds here.

104
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:31,604
Grab me one.

105
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,855
Grab me one.

106
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,525
Eliza!

107
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:35,858
Up here.

108
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,359
So cute.

109
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:44,367
Here we go.

110
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,580
Hey, here we go.

111
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,373
Okay.

112
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,542
Okay.

113
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,501
Cool.

114
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,503
My god.

115
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,212
Thank you.

116
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,880
Here we come.

117
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:05,964
Don't hurt yourself.

118
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,182
My god.

119
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,269
My god.

120
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,492
Here?

121
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,162
Make your way to ho chi
Minh's transportation and.

122
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,789
Search for your next clue.

123
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,625
I got one, nicole. Let's go.

124
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,960
Come on, chris.

125
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:18,628
Speed bump.

126
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,463
Got it.

127
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,175
That's a good picture of me.
Yep.

128
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,594
Having arrived last in
The previous leg, chris and

129
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,638
Bret must now complete this
Speed bump.

130
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,809
They must fill up this cooler
With snowballs and then.

131
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,603
Transport them to college
Transportation central in ho.

132
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,686
Chi minh city.

133
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,647
Ok.

134
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,650
Let's do it. >> Taxi!

135
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,028
I would go to a bigger
Intersection.

136
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,155
Taxi, taxi, taxi!

137
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,156
Taxi.

138
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,157
Who's in there?

139
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,158
We can't share.

140
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,286
There's not enough space in the
Car.

141
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,205
That's us. >> We're us.

142
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,289
Ok.

143
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,708
Like they wouldn't take Ours.

144
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,668
I know.

145
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,795
Nicole, where are you? Come on.

146
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,712
There's no cars coming.

147
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,465
We're going the wrong way in
Traffic.

148
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,969
We're in the race. >> Taxi!

149
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,055
Yes!
Eliza tried to take our cab.

150
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,684
And then our cab driver said
No, no.

151
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,728
I cannot... being pushed in
Front of us and they push in.

152
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,190
Front of everyone at every
Opportunity.

153
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,354
Like you would take our cab.
I don't like them.

154
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,754
I don't have any interest in
Talking to them after this game.

155
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,738
Ends.
And I'm... I'll block them on.

156
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,741
All social media.
We'll focus on beating them.

157
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,928
In the race and no reason to be
Bitter after the race because.

158
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:38,040
We will have beaten them.
It was a big cluster with.

159
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,167
Other teams.

160
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,715
And taxis... >> please.

161
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,887
Consider can we get a taxi.
Where can we get a taxi?

162
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,015
The speed bump we had to
Make snowballs and fill up an.

163
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,784
Ice chest and they had to be a
Certain size and really.

164
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,726
Compact.

165
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,769
That's good. >> More.

166
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,230
More?

167
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,314
More.

168
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,356
My hands are numb.
It was so cold that our...

169
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,446
Our hands and more like ice
That we were molding and not as.

170
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,405
Easy as real snow.

171
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,489
Tight, tight.

172
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,573
My god.

173
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,910
Like a blizzard.
Polar bear was taunting us.

174
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,993
That's a good one.

175
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,913
Come on! Very picky polar bear.

176
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,039
My god.

177
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,750
Losing my mind.

178
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:25,379
Taxi, taxi, taxi!

179
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,340
Colen and christie don't
Have one, here.

180
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,760
We should have kept their
Freaking cab there.

181
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,904
Where can we find a taxi?

182
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,598
You want to go toward those
Buildings?

183
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,933
Taxi!

184
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:42,104
Let's just hop in. This is it?

185
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,608
Our driver just pulled over.
And randomly asked somebody who.

186
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,735
Is 107 years old about where
We're going.

187
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,780
If you don't know where
Something is, don't say you do.

188
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,823
Yes? Yes?

189
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:57,078
He's got to turn around Again.

190
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,789
Those motor bikes are pretty
Dangerous.

191
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,790
This is remarkable.

192
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:06,462
I don't...
it's either move or get hit.

193
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,338
My god.

194
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,467
Here we go.
Into the parade of them.

195
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:19,183
It is. Insane.

196
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,769
Molar bear.

197
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,771
Roadblock.
Who feels like driving.

198
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,315
Themselves crazy? Me.

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,818
Here in vietnam it's not
Uncommon to see entire families.

200
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,613
Making their way around on a
Motor bike which zip in and out.

201
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,783
Of traffic here 24-7.
Teams need to master these.

202
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:40,162
Skills to earn a scooter
License.

203
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,848
Making their way around this
Challenging course, teams will.

204
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,711
Need to stay within the yellow
Lines while driving through a.

205
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,506
Figure eight and over a series
Of speed bumps without touching.

206
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:53,009
Their feet on the ground to
Pass the test.

207
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,804
That's what you call a
Roadblock.

208
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:01,225
Who's... instructor?
You raised your hand.

209
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,184
Let's do it.

210
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,268
I can't believe this.

211
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,955
The last two first.
It feels like driving.

212
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,690
Themselves crazy. You want to?

213
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,775
Sure >> stay within the line.

214
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,361
Ok? >> Come on, jamal, you got.

215
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,405
This. This is the break, yeah?

216
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,033
Number three.

217
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,703
You have to make like a
Number eight basically going.

218
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,749
One big circle, come back, and
The turns you have to be.

219
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,875
Careful.

220
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,835
Because this is not an
Automatic scooter.

221
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,045
Come on, jamal.

222
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,715
A lot of the balancing with
Your body weight, go too fast.

223
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,508
You'll lose control.

224
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,384
Wait.

225
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,887
Can you not put your feet down?
No.

226
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,888
Ok.

227
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,932
So... >> scooter girl.

228
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,933
You're scooter girl.

229
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,061
It looks really hard.

230
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:51,359
But luckily I have major
Balance.

231
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:59,442
Do I need to start over?

232
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:04,246
Went the wrong way.

233
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,330
Let me do this again.

234
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,418
Not as easy as what it looks
Like.

235
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,796
You have to go through the
Circle.

236
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,922
Taxi!

237
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,591
This is all motorcycles.
Brit they, come on.

238
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,676
Britney, come on.
We have no idea where we're.

239
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Going.

240
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,096
We need to cross.

241
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,823
A handful of teams in the
Same boat that we were looking.

242
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,973
For a cab.

243
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,268
There were so many parts of
This game that are out of your.

244
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,436
Control.

245
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,373
Season five, there would
Have been a lot more profanity.

246
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,940
I don't know.
It would have been bad.

247
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,942
Is he coming here? All right.

248
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,446
We called a taxi because
Sometimes you just have to wait.

249
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,616
For them to come to you.

250
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:47,248
Come on, bret. Good

251
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,292
yeah, buddy.
We have to do about 25 to 30.

252
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,419
Snowballs.

253
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,880
It was like a frostbite... like
A tingling feel.

254
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,841
One more each.
Good one, good one, good.

255
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,925
One.

256
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:03,139
There it is.
Thank you, thank you.

257
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,141
Let's go, let's go.

258
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,267
Ok.

259
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,994
Let's go get a cab.
We got teams down here.

260
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,018
It's an emergency.

261
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,815
All right. >> Let's go.

262
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,315
Back in it, baby.

263
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,485
Hop in. >> Yes.

264
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,445
Taxi.

265
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,488
Yes. >> Hi.

266
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,573
Yes.

267
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,992
Vroom, vroom, vroom.
This is stupid.

268
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,993
We have to go back that way.

269
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,662
Taxi!

270
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,664
Taxi! >> Wow.

271
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:33,002
This is a doozy.

272
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,379
Driving themselves crazy.

273
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,505
You want me to drive?

274
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,551
You want to drive? Sure.

275
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,553
Victor is going to do this
Driving thing.

276
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,056
He wanted to do it.
Let him do it.

277
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,894
You want me to start over?
Here you go, girl.

278
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:54,023
You do it.

279
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,859
Come on, jamal.

280
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,070
You got this.
You're leaning too much to.

281
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,322
The right.

282
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,133
You're going to get out of the
Yellow line so I tend to keep.

283
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,743
The center of gravity and the
Straight line so if I need to.

284
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,871
Lean left or right I can put my
Body weight or force it.

285
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:13,417
Whichever way I needed. >> Yeah!

286
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,418
Yes!

287
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,921
I love vietnam! Come on, baby.

288
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,923
I'm going to give you a hug
With one hand.

289
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,049
Yeah.

290
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:25,137
Number one, number one!
Make your way to bean quai.

291
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:30,351
Village for your next clue.
Lee, lee, lee, lee.

292
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:38,434
My sister is a bad ass and
She's got this.

293
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,238
Woo! I was really focused and.

294
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,281
Able to do it.

295
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,409
I just nailed it. Proud of you.

296
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,119
So proud of you.
Thank you so much.

297
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,121
Thank you. >> Ok.

298
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,122
Come on.

299
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,584
Let's go.
We got to get our ice chest.

300
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,585
Hit it.

301
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,586
There's the bear.

302
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,670
This is the bear.

303
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,715
Here's the clue box.
Who feels like driving.

304
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,759
Themselves crazy?
You have to do it.

305
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,760
We're good?

306
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,221
Ok. >> Thank you, thank you.

307
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,304
Get the clue.

308
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,223
Yeah.

309
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,975
I'm going to do it. >> Let's go.

310
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:11,934
Let's go.

311
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,017
It was a narrow path.

312
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,397
And you had to balance the
Scooter.

313
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Good job, babe.

314
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,567
Going slow on a moped is
Hard to balance.

315
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,442
It's easier if you're heavier.

316
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,987
Because you can control the
Weight better.

317
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,072
Haven't ridden a scooter in
A while.

318
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,951
I'm scared.

319
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,037
Woo! >> Thank you!

320
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,457
We're feeling really good
Right now and chris is going to.

321
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,458
Kill this scooter challenge.

322
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,586
So I'm very excited right now.

323
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,006
I'm very excited.
I find these things.

324
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,133
Terrifying. My god.

325
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm so scared.

326
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,719
And drives you crazy.

327
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,804
This girl's crazy. Roadblock.

328
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:52,391
Roadblock.
Who feels like driving.

329
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,310
Themselves crazy? Me.

330
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,978
How do we even know it's
That way?

331
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:56,979
We don't.

332
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,105
We don't know.

333
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,358
My god, my god.
I wish you were watching.

334
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,443
That side.

335
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,526
That's what I do wish.

336
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,529
Dude... >> money, money.

337
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,156
Come on. Let's go.

338
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,618
Show them a $50. >> Yay...

339
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,120
I hope we know where we're
Going.

340
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,789
I could cry right now.
It's been a while.

341
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,875
Are you kidding me right Now?

342
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:24,923
Taxi.

343
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,176
Thank you, thank you, thank you
, thank you.

344
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,179
Yes, yes.
It's nice not to be running.

345
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:35,184
Through the streets anymore.

346
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,310
Mini motor bike.

347
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:42,149
Vietnam. 100 million people.

348
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,526
I'm scared.

349
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,197
Go, eliza, go.
Corrine, this is horrible.

350
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,574
You are fearless.

351
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,659
Come on, chris.

352
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,204
Looks good.

353
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,872
That didn't work.

354
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:57,998
Why did you stop?

355
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,043
It seems to have stalled.

356
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,088
Look at that girl on that
Scooter.

357
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,549
Yes, look at her. Shoot.

358
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,634
Way to go, colin.

359
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,680
We actually have a dirt bike
For our 11-year-old.

360
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,724
And colin recently got one for
Himself.

361
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,726
So they go dirt biking Together.

362
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,229
This will make for good
Practice.

363
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,230
We're doing good, colin.

364
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,400
We're doing good.
I was just like show me my.

365
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,528
Bike and I was dead focused on
Trying to make up some time.

366
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,114
Woo! >> Thank you very much!

367
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,241
Thank you very much.

368
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,200
Yeah.

369
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,704
All right. >> And driving...

370
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,747
you do it.
Janelle has more experience.

371
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,082
Doing like a.T.V.'s.

372
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,185
So when we pulled up and saw
This, it was definitely that.

373
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,921
She was going to do it.
And never anything like this.

374
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,923
There were teams finishing and
Like my god.

375
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,384
And I was freaking out.
Go, janelle.

376
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,138
You got it.
I need to stop freaking out.

377
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:58,267
I'm ok.

378
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,895
Sorry.

379
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,314
Thank you. Thank you, buddy.

380
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,400
Come on, leo.
There, there, there, there.

381
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,068
Detour.

382
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:15,284
- Irritation or irrigation?
- Tungchai are boats use by.

383
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,345
Vietnamese fishermen to set
Their traps in the water.

384
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,290
They must paddle 200 yards to
Retrieve a basket of fish and.

385
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,835
Carry their basket boats over
Bridges and dodge these.

386
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,463
Annoying fishermen before
Delivering it to a fish monger.

387
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,174
Over half of vietnam's
Population earned their living.

388
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:35,637
From agriculture.
With rice being the number one.

389
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,639
Crop. Perhaps a farmer's most.

390
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,185
Valuable tool is an irrigation
Wheel like this which teams.

391
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:46,356
Must now build using natural
Resources under the watchful.

392
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,026
Eye of a local farmer.

393
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,028
We're going to do Irrigation.

394
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,112
Right here.

395
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,197
That's it. >> Yeah.

396
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,492
No. That's it.

397
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,618
Come on, come on!

398
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,262
It's half built already.
Yeah, we can do this.

399
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,204
Open it up.

400
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,330
Open it.

401
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,373
Put everything out.

402
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,168
We have to go back and look at
It.

403
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,170
The example, two here, two Here.

404
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,253
Ok.

405
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,840
Let's go.
We go to the irrigation.

406
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,008
Wheel.

407
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,372
Once we put all the wood we
Have to tie it with this sort.

408
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,405
Of rubber bandy material.
We have to tie all these,

409
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,015
Two wraps on all the things, Ok?

410
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,016
Yeah.

411
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,017
We're doing irrigation.

412
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,144
Right over here.

413
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,188
Right here.
We have to go look at what we.

414
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,189
Have to do. Come on.

415
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,567
Ok.
That's our bucket that we have.

416
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,652
To fill.

417
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,738
I'll count how many. 13 chais.

418
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,740
We have to see what like it
Has on it.

419
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,742
How many are on there right Now.

420
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:44,373
Seven. We need to tie on six.

421
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,042
Who feels like driving
Themselves crazy?

422
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:51,338
Cina. >> What... I don't...

423
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,383
I don't think there was much
Of a trick and not to gas it.

424
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,386
That much but if you didn't gas
It enough you would just fall.

425
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,889
Over. >> Come on, let's go.

426
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:06,144
And the center of your core
Tight.

427
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,606
We passed? >> Second leg.

428
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,401
Two back. >> Becca got it.

429
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,904
Set. Boom.

430
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:21,076
We're back in it, baby!

431
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:28,417
And didn't hate mow p.E.D.'s
Before, I would... mopeds.

432
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,920
Before, I would really hate
Them.

433
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,922
Elijah seemed a bit Hopeless.

434
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,009
This is so terrible.
Eliza, don't get in your.

435
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,553
Head. >> My gosh.

436
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,555
This is so scary.
This bike is big.

437
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:45,309
Slow and steady.
I already failed?

438
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,604
This is going to go badly.

439
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:56,687
Which one is go? >> Crash.

440
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,286
I think it's this right Here.

441
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,287
Right here.

442
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,079
This right here.

443
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,348
I think we passed it.
Not this way.

444
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,372
We definitely passed it.

445
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,793
Naung. Thank you.

446
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,920
Thank you.

447
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,563
We are going to check out
Irritation.

448
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,465
Because being irritated is
Super fun.

449
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,968
Both utches paddleboard but.

450
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,640
That's my only... of us
Paddleboard but that's my only.

451
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,642
Form of exercise.
Want to just paddle?

452
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,643
Yeah.

453
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,645
Let's paddle.
It's going to be balance and.

454
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,395
Sink the boat.

455
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,521
Definitely.

456
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,775
If we don't balance...
pick up one of the fish...

457
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,526
Let's just get in the boat.
Be careful.

458
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,947
Be careful.
The brown brass ket that you.

459
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,050
Weave and there was some people
In the way of everybody.

460
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:50,074
A little obnoxious.
Don't knock us over, please.

461
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,583
My gosh.

462
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:56,338
We're making a bamboo wheel.
And it is going to bring water.

463
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,133
To a pot.
There's a method to how you.

464
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,552
Have to tie it.
All the tying should be the.

465
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,305
Same way.
You got to make sure the angles.

466
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,184
Are correct because if they're
Not, the water won't fill up.

467
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,062
The way it's supposed to.
Perfect.

468
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,082
It's so hard when you are
Reading the detour clue to know.

469
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,483
What detour is going to be
Harder.

470
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,586
We thought that it might be
Really hard to paddle the boat.

471
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,530
And we thought from our
Experience as moms, building.

472
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,367
Toys, I...
literally, once your mom,

473
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,469
Kind of a superwoman.
We're a force to be reckoned.

474
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,453
With.
Definitely stronger than the.

475
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,539
Other teams.

476
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:38,171
Korey, you got this.
On the foot brake.

477
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,255
On the foot brake.

478
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,717
My god. I'm so stressed.

479
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,719
Slow. Slow.

480
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,446
Went really fast and that's
When I crashed.

481
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,389
So I decided to take it a
Little slower.

482
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,726
Good job, janelle.
She's doing a really good.

483
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,893
Job.

484
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,563
She goes over... just like the
Hard part.

485
00:21:54,646 --> 00:22:00,569
We did it! >> We did it.

486
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,570
I freaking did it, man.

487
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:07,909
I think she did great. Woo!

488
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:14,124
Run like the wind!
There's 13... right there.

489
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:20,756
Check, check.

490
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,800
One thing we didn't notice
Was that we had to fill up the.

491
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,928
Bucket with a lot of water
Which will take the longest.

492
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,056
Time. Not a good feeling.

493
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:36,271
Check, check, please, check.
Not yet.

494
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,272
What's wrong?

495
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,523
Can you tell us?

496
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,443
There's is definitely wrong.
You got some going this way,

497
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,820
That way.
So we got to just redo the.

498
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,572
Ties. That's all we need to do.

499
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,574
There's actually a precise
Way to do this.

500
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:52,079
Some of them, were not lined up
Correctly.

501
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:56,583
I'm trying to stay calm. Ok.

502
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,627
Just focus. Just focus.

503
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,628
Feels good!

504
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,629
Thank you!

505
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,339
Get away from them.

506
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,424
Do not play around. Focus.

507
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,050
Ok.

508
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,173
You go and hop off. >> Ok.

509
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,653
So when you got to the
Bridge you had to kind of.

510
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,263
Carefully get out of the boat
Without tipping it.

511
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,325
And then pick the boat up and
Put it over the bridge and then.

512
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,768
Carefully get back in so that
You don't tip and let a bunch.

513
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,769
Of water in.

514
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,022
So a little bit of a delicate
Balancing act.

515
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,150
It does look like the fish
Traps right there.

516
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,151
Ok.

517
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,235
Good job.

518
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,279
Good job. >> It's tiring.

519
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,366
For $1 million.

520
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,451
How are you going to lift
That thing?

521
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,496
One, two, three. He's the man!

522
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,497
My gosh. >> That's some...

523
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,708
look at those strong Muscles.

524
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,003
It's exhausting. All right.

525
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,172
Keep going. Keep going.

526
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,173
Same momentum.

527
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,175
Slow, slow, slow. You got it.

528
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,635
It's coming.

529
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,221
Sounds like you peeing but it's
Coming.

530
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,682
One of our bamboo pieces
Were not turned at a good angle.

531
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,351
And just this needs to be tied
Better.

532
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,453
And then I think we're good.

533
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:04,192
Supervisor, check? It's not.

534
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,570
You have to be turned to the
Side.

535
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,571
We got to tie this right.

536
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,572
Wo, are you ok?

537
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,700
My god.

538
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,370
Having corrine and eliza, I
Thought ok, I just have to pass.

539
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,914
One team.
And we're back out of last.

540
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,541
Place.

541
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,044
I got it. I got it.

542
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,714
Keep staying in the lines.
I got it, I got it.

543
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,593
Stunning.

544
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,594
That was perfect.

545
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:35,473
That was so good. Yeah, korey!

546
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,434
Thank you. >> You killed it.

547
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,435
You killed it.

548
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,561
Thank you, thank you.

549
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,896
We're last team for sure.

550
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,897
Good job, guys.

551
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,040
I'm going to try and get it.

552
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:48,069
Thank you!
I respect how hard it is.

553
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,197
You're going to be fine.

554
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Breathe.

555
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,240
All right.

556
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:57,871
This is it. You got it.

557
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,457
My god.

558
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,586
Getting worse, not better.
One by one, teams arrived.

559
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,420
And they left.

560
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:08,757
And I was nowhere near passing
Mine.

561
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Yeah.

562
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,345
Don't freak out.
You're going to be fine.

563
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,764
It's... you just keep trying
Over and over again.

564
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,849
You'll get it.

565
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,276
I'm trying to pull it Together.

566
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,612
I'm feeling a little frustrated
And defeated.

567
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,281
She didn't grow up in a trailer
Park with a freaking moped.

568
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,325
She rides bicycles.
She's got really good balance.

569
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,661
And super athletic.
But, you know, we have no.

570
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,787
Experience doing this.

571
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,830
Ok.

572
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,874
Irritation. >> We're going to do.

573
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,960
Irritation.
This looks like more fun.

574
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,962
Anyway. >> Ok.

575
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,964
I've never been in a boat
Like this.

576
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,008
Basically a big basket and guys
Trying to make wake to push us.

577
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,135
Back or splash us or block us.

578
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,859
So we kind of had to navigate
Around them.

579
00:25:55,887 --> 00:26:00,433
We couldn't just g straight.
It was like annoying.

580
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:06,940
We have to be very Deliberate.

581
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,942
Are these... >> the traps.

582
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,111
Go ahead, baby.

583
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:16,908
Five fish. >> Count them.

584
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,745
One, two, three... five. Ok.

585
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,830
Five fish.

586
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,456
And keep the basket?

587
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,457
No.

588
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,541
Like this.

589
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:30,005
Where's the fish monger?
Hold this, baby.

590
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,006
Is there five in there?

591
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,007
Five.

592
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,009
Here. >> We got the fish.

593
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:34,843
And we got the basket.

594
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,846
Let's do irritation. Irritation.

595
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,349
Let's go.
When I saw the circular.

596
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,810
Boat, it was a... because of
The size of us in that boat.

597
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:47,981
No maximum limits of wake?
I would say 500 pounds.

598
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,525
Come on. Bring it, baby!

599
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,695
A big boy you got to take On.

600
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,031
Woo! >> Boy.

601
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,200
Give way.

602
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,869
Let's get it over the bridge
First.

603
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:05,248
We were trying to pull this
Heavy, heavy boat over the.

604
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,332
Railing.

605
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,292
The wooden railing.

606
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,378
We almost broke the whole
Bridge.

607
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,423
Want to go up there? Ok.

608
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:18,053
Work.

609
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:22,223
It says pick up one of the
Fish traps at the end of the.

610
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,308
Channel.

611
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,393
At first we only had the Fish.

612
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,189
We weren't sure if you had to
Have the basket.

613
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,273
Please go back.

614
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,959
I think we need the basket.
So we actually turned.

615
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,860
Around. >> Second pass...

616
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,463
hauling ass.
Nick and vick were able to.

617
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:43,487
Pass us up. >>!

618
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,265
It's getting... slow down.
There you go.

619
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,289
Slow down.

620
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,083
Keep going.

621
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,377
We're almost there.
Check, check!

622
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,880
A bit more like how much More?

623
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,548
That's a lot more.

624
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,592
Yeah.

625
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,677
My god, rach.

626
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,556
Dropped in the ocean.

627
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,101
So we have to go back for
Another tie.

628
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,895
I'm such an idiot.
I would be instantly worse.

629
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:13,942
At this which is why I can't
Even possibly be mad.

630
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,820
There you go.

631
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,113
Very nice.

632
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,950
I guess at some point I just
Kind of pulled it together and.

633
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,035
Started going steady.
Bring it home!

634
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,995
And I knew I had my partner
On my side.

635
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,082
Yes! Eliza!

636
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:35,338
Woo!

637
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:43,138
All right.
Get off the damn bike.

638
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,764
Easy does it.

639
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,765
Yeah.

640
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,849
Easy does it.

641
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,392
Right here.

642
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,144
Two, three, four, five.

643
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,270
Ok.

644
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,272
Woo! Woo!

645
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,356
Nice.

646
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,485
Ok, please, be still alive.

647
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,487
Yay! Thank you.

648
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,948
Watch out, watch out.

649
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,992
Hurry. >> Thank you.

650
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,035
Thank you. >> Thank you.

651
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,121
Thank you, thank you, thank You.

652
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,832
One, two, three, four, five.
Pit stop.

653
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,250
Run to fill in the mat.

654
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,960
This is tamboo park.

655
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,338
An idyllic green space where
Locals come to exercise and get.

656
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,066
Away from it all.
These serene grounds are the.

657
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,470
Pit stop of this leg of the
Race.

658
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,513
The last team to check in here
May be eliminated.

659
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,514
Let's go.

660
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,932
Let's go.

661
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,976
Our competition. >> Ok, guys.

662
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:30,977
Let's do this.

663
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,645
Let's ask where we are.

664
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,191
How do I get here? This way.

665
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:41,362
Rock 'n' roll.
All the way down there.

666
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,424
Right on the side of the river.
We should do irritation.

667
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,492
Let's go. >> Get in here.

668
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:52,165
Let's just get in here.
This thing is spinning.

669
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:56,252
We are like spinning in a
Circle.

670
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,980
We'll do irritation.
Give me the paddle.

671
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:03,968
That way. That's mean.

672
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,052
You're mean.

673
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,012
You're mean.

674
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,597
That's a bully.

675
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,782
You're a bully. You're a bully.

676
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,724
Keep going.

677
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,118
We're almost there.
Can we check now?

678
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,120
I think we're there.
Are they all done already?

679
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,688
That's good. >> Come on.

680
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,732
Right here. Leo.

681
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:20,235
We're... pit stop. All right.

682
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,903
Please, please.

683
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,111
Yes.

684
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:22,904
Yes.

685
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,365
We got it.

686
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,283
Not...
make sure our water can come.

687
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,368
Out.

688
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,079
Just make sure turn it and see
If we can get water.

689
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,540
Then we're good.

690
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't understand what we
Did wrong with ours.

691
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,002
We got it. >> Setting.

692
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,089
We got it, rach.
We have to do the other.

693
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,216
Detour. >> Like we're good.

694
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,218
Everyone is doing it, Though.

695
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,887
You don't understand.
Tie one more time.

696
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,073
I was freaking out a little
Bit at the wheel.

697
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,308
That is when I go into then
Elissa.

698
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,435
Hope for the best.
Expect the worst.

699
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,395
No.

700
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,478
No.

701
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,438
Not expect the worst.

702
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,522
No.

703
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,440
Sorry.

704
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,442
That's a bad saying for this
Situation.

705
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,444
Just... get water. >> I did.

706
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,168
All right.
Don't put all your weight on.

707
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,991
The edge of the boat. I won't.

708
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,993
Stay steady. All right.

709
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,662
Grab one. >> All right.

710
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,788
Count the fish.

711
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,791
One, two, three, four, five.
In the basket.

712
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:18,293
Ok, we got them.
Bromance is happening.

713
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,795
Take a little love ride.
I always dreamed that venice.

714
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:22,964
Would be like this.
Easy does it.

715
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,300
Got it?

716
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:32,640

Irritation. >> Grab the paddle.

Low.

Is this how we do it?

810
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,113
I've not had much experience
Paddling boats but I don't.

811
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,431
Think it takes a rocket
Scientist.

812
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,432
My god.

813
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,559

It's gang time.

821
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,813
We needed to put this away and
Make a stand in front of these.

822
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,256
People and show them we're
Something to be feared.

It can't be touching the...
higher.

834
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,953
There we go, yes. Check, check!

835

Ok.

838
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,461
The blue. Just go fast.

839
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,255
Maybe we should do it together.
It's going... when I go fast

840
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,257
we still have to put water.

841
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,800
In it.

842
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,635
Rach, it's ok.
Carefully, carefully,

843
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,636
Carefully.

844
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,304
I have blisters on both of
My hands.

845
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,388
Ok.

846
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,306
We're almost at the end.

847
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,768
Wait, wait, you're about to
Push me in.

848
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,271
Are we the last team?

849
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,832
We don't see anybody... ok.
There's no teams here.

850
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,816
Ok.

851
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,989
We're going to get up on those.
Do you want to grab the basket?

852
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,326
One, two, three, four, five. Ok.

853
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,453
You got it. >> Yeah?

854
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,039
We got a long time to go.
What were we thinking?

855
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,500
We definitely lost our lead.
That's for sure.

856
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,501
We're the last team.

857
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,586
We're in last place.
This is us going home.

858
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,844
I fell, rach.

859
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,555
It sucks.

860
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,682
Just go.

861
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,557
It's fne.

862
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,684
Just go.

863
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,394
Bad. Don't you do this.

864
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,437
Rach, it's back. Calm down.

865
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,689
I'm calm.

866
00:37:54,772 --> 00:38:02,029
I just don't think we knew what
We were getting ourselves into.

867
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,031
Get out. I'm sorry.

868
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,492
I can only do one thing at a
Time.

869
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:11,205
I hate manley labor.
One, two... manual labor.

870
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,331
One, two, three.

871
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:20,415
Fish monger! A couple of jocks.

872
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,426
- >> Hello.

873

876
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,181
Correct.

877
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,727
Congratulations.

Day.

00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,900
We were leading and went to
Hell from there.

881
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,403
Toward the end of the group
Or the last team is competing,

882
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,115
That can be scary.

883
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:52,872
Heavy. Blisters.

884
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:56,917
This is worse than... a little
Bit more.

885
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,001
Hurry.

886
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:58,961
I'm hurrying.

887
00:38:59,045 --> 00:38:59,962
Don't lose our water.

888
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,088
My gosh.

889
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:06,594
Check, please. We're good!

890
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,721
Woo! >> Thank you so much.

Done, either.

894
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:22,234
Hurry, rach.

895
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,779
Thank you. >> Thank you.

896
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,405
Let's do this.

897
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,489
We're still in it.

898
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,449
We are still in it!

899
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,826
Hurry. >> Elissa...

900
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,662
let's go.

901
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:37,083
What a way to finish, Britney.

902
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,126
Janelle was definitely carrying
The team.

903
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,170
Yes. She did it all today.

904
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,588
She really did it all.

905
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,671
I took out a polar bear.

906
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:49,470
And that's... was the extent.
That way, go!

907
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,846
Corrine!

908
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,641
We're in it.
Come on, come on, come on.

909
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:58,562
Rach, come on. Corrine, corrine!

910
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,191
That way. Go!

911
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,317
Small street, though.

912
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Go, go, go!

913
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,363
I see... >> rachel, hurry.

914
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,781
I see it, corrine, come on.

915
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,782
I'm coming.

916
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,491
That way.

917
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:18,574
We caught up.

918
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:25,506
- >> Little girl.
- Rachel and elissa, you.

919
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,007
Are still in the race.

920
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,052
And you are officially team
Number eight.

921
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,011
Congratulations.

922
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,055
The race is not over yet.

923
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:38,352
It's just like we're so
Glessed... blessed and don't.

924
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:42,523
Want to take that for granted.

925
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,190
I guess we're not blessed.

926
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,985
We're not #blessed apparently.

927
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,029
Corrine and eliza, I'm
Sorry to tell you you have been.

928
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:55,327
Eliminated from the race. Sorry.

929
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,747
We were hoping to do
"Survivor" a little prouder.

930
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,748
Than this.

931
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,749
But we did our best.

932
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,502
We gave it everything we Had.

933
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,605
And when you know you've given
It everything you have, and you.

934
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,910
Still fail, then you're like
Ok, what I had wasn't enough.

935
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,925
Right.
Which is the lowest of the.

936
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,093
Low feeling.

937
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,737
It was definitely worse
Because it was to rachel and.

938
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,680
Elissa. We're devastated.

939
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,598
We're so disappointed.

940
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,058
I don't respect us.

941
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,227
Surviving for life is Terrible.

942
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,229
We respect them as Competitors.

943
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,231
And we respect them as... women.

944
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,609
Racers and women and they're
Really strong.

945
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,795
And then to have to stand there
At our elimination on the mat.

946
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:33,282
With rachel and elissa who...
Like we respect you as women.

947
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,868
I was like get out of here with
Your fake b.S.

948
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,913
Like I have no interest in
Hearing from them.

949
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:46,996
And we're not speaking to them
Ever again.

950
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:57,048
And we're not speaking to them
Ever again.

951
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,728
I just couldn't cry in front
Of the men and give them the.

952
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:03,646
Satisfaction. >> Yorn.

953
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,271
I'm not... I don't know.

954
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,439
I'm not a positive person.

955
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:07,233
I don't know how to spin this.

956
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,319
I hate them so much.
I don't ever want to see.

957
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,737
Their faces earlier.

958
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,157
I won't be attending any
Parties or speaking with any of.

959
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,481
These people. Take a good look.

960
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:24,533
Thrgs the last time... this is
The last time you're seeing me.

961
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:34,710
Thrgs the last time... this is
The last time you're seeing me.

962
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,515
Stay tuned for scenes
From our next episode.

963
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,982

- >> we are king, baby!
- Teams soar over dubai.

965
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,780
My god!

966
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:58,367
While janelle and britney
Get prehistoric...

967
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,660
things in my face. >> Aah!

968
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,122
And rachel and elissa
Fear extinction.

969
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,123
"The amazing race."

970
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,917
It is good and fun.
