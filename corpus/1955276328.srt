she's probably very scared.

She thinks I'm behind all of this.

-You could just hit her.
-Yeah.

1393
01:09:58,085 --> 01:09:59,045
-Really?
-Like really hard.

1394
01:09:59,164 --> 01:10:00,404
-I've got a family.
-HOLLY: It's not practical.

1395
01:10:00,523 --> 01:10:03,365
JACKSON: We probably shouldn't hit her
if we want her to talk to us.

1396
01:10:03,484 --> 01:10:05,043
It's okay.

1397
01:10:05,162 --> 01:10:06,844
You were supposed
to get those guys off of me.

1398
01:10:06,963 --> 01:10:08,565
Do you know who they were?
Do you know who sent them?

1399
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:11,203
Yeah. It was my mother.

1400
01:10:17,205 --> 01:10:19,924
Would you mind starting
from the top because...

1401
01:10:20,043 --> 01:10:23,084
-Why? It doesn't matter.
-I'm sorry, it doesn't matter?

1402
01:10:23,203 --> 01:10:25,047
You just shot at us. I think it matters.

1403
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:27,044
Okay, okay. I made a film.

1404
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:29,444
I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.

1405
01:10:29,567 --> 01:10:31,164
And the idea was
that we were gonna, you know,

1406
01:10:31,287 --> 01:10:35,365
like make this experimental film,

1407
01:10:35,484 --> 01:10:36,886
like an artistic film.

1408
01:10:37,005 --> 01:10:39,087
-Porno film.
-It's not a porno.

1410
01:10:42,366 --> 01:10:44,206
Look, do you even know
who my mother is?

1411
01:10:44,325 --> 01:10:45,888
Yes, we do.

1412
01:10:46,007 --> 01:10:48,165
We... We've actually met your mother.

1413
01:10:48,288 --> 01:10:50,085
(SCOFFING) What did she
tell you, that I'm crazy?

1414
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,086
(STAMMERS) That I was just lashing out?

1415
01:10:52,205 --> 01:10:53,368
Something like that.
She might have mentioned...

1416
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:56,886
Yeah, well, my mother is a criminal.

1417
01:10:57,005 --> 01:10:58,207
She's one of them.

1418
01:10:58,326 --> 01:11:01,126
-Who's them? What's them?
-AMELIA: One of the insiders.

1419
01:11:01,248 --> 01:11:04,685
One of the capitalist, corporate suppressors.

1420
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:05,968
You know, they want us dead, man.

1421
01:11:06,087 --> 01:11:07,527
We're just in their crosshairs, you know.

We're just pawns.

Gosh.

Hey. (WHISTLES SLOWLY)

01:11:14,969 --> 01:11:16,809
And what does this have to do
with the birds?

JACKSON: Yeah.

1428
01:11:18,568 --> 01:11:21,087
My mom's supposed to be working
for the Justice Department, right?

1429
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:23,249
Sure, she's prosecuting
the catalytic converter case.

1430
01:11:23,368 --> 01:11:26,168
Yeah, only she's not.
She's not prosecuting it.

1431
01:11:26,287 --> 01:11:28,168
The auto makers,
she's gonna let 'em walk.

1432
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:30,449
-But they have the evidence.
-Yes, they have evidence.

1433
01:11:30,568 --> 01:11:34,290
They have memos proving that
Detroit conspired to suppress the converter,

1434
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:35,407
proving they would rather

1435
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,250
poison our air than spend
a little bit of money.

1436
01:11:37,369 --> 01:11:38,767
But my mom, she's gonna say
that's not enough.

1437
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:41,528
She's gonna lie because...
Because she's on the take.

Mammon, that's her god.

-Okay, okay.

1443
01:11:51,329 --> 01:11:52,488

(LAUGHING) She is the police.

1445
01:11:54,408 --> 01:11:56,451
She's the head of the Justice Department.

All right, so then your solution

1450
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:07,530
-was you make a porn film.
-(SIGHS)

1451
01:12:07,649 --> 01:12:08,771
It's not a porno!

HOLLAND: You know, I have neighbours.

1453
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,889
-I made a statement.
-JACKSON: Right.

1454
01:12:12,012 --> 01:12:15,050
And yeah, yeah,
my statement contained nudity.

1455
01:12:15,172 --> 01:12:16,209
-Porno nudity.
-AMELIA: Art.

1456
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,732
That's just the commercial element, okay?

1457
01:12:18,851 --> 01:12:21,010
Okay? Sid said we had to have that.

1458
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:23,333
And the reality was
we were getting our message out there.

1459
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:25,491
And... And it was all in the film,

1460
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:27,692
names and dates and everything,

1461
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:28,894
everything that my mom was doing,

1462
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:30,971
and once it was out there,
once it was in theatres,

1463
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,050
there's no way that
they could suppress it.

1464
01:12:32,173 --> 01:12:34,892
There's no way that they could cover it up.

1465
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:36,451
HOLLAND: So let me get this straight.

1466
01:12:36,574 --> 01:12:39,212
You made a porno film
where the point was the plot?

1467
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:40,852
(SIGHS) What's your hang-up, man?

01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:44,531
It's... It's what's in the story.

1470
01:12:44,654 --> 01:12:46,693

-Your mom killed Dean?
-Of course.

her mother's single-handedly

gonna wipe out all of Western society.

01:14:02,018 --> 01:14:04,898
Said she needed $100,000 in cash.

-$100,000? Why?
<i>-I don't know.</i>

in something shady maybe.

1502
01:14:10,498 --> 01:14:12,541
Well, her daughter

We were just talking and she fell on our car.

01:14:28,702 --> 01:14:30,821
<i>I've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:35,461
Would you be willing
to carry the money for me?

01:14:42,785 --> 01:14:45,784
I wish I knew who to believe on this one.

01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:47,942
Well, the kid's a write-off,
I'll tell you that much.

1516
01:14:50,343 --> 01:14:51,906
Maybe they're both telling the truth.

1517
01:14:52,025 --> 01:14:53,945
We're downstairs.

1518
01:14:54,943 --> 01:14:56,065
She's coming down.

1519
01:14:58,304 --> 01:14:59,786
What do you mean,
they're both telling the truth?

1520
01:14:59,905 --> 01:15:01,027
What the fuck does that mean?

1521
01:15:01,146 --> 01:15:03,465
I got a friend, right?

1522
01:15:03,584 --> 01:15:05,466
Secret Service. Worked the Nixon detail.

1523
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:07,986
This was after they threw him out of office.

1524
01:15:08,988 --> 01:15:10,148
No. Anyway, you know,

1525
01:15:10,267 --> 01:15:12,187
Nixon's driving around one day
around San Clemente.

1526
01:15:12,306 --> 01:15:14,587
-Just him and a few agents.
-Yeah.

1527
01:15:14,706 --> 01:15:16,707
And they come across
this car accident, right?

1528
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:19,108
There's a guy pinned under a car.

1529
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:23,228
Anyway, Nixon gets out,
runs over to check on the guy,

1530
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:25,149
you know, leans down,
and Nixon says to him,

1531
01:15:25,268 --> 01:15:28,471
"You're gonna be okay, son.
You're gonna be all right."

1532
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,109
And right then the guy dies.

1533
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:34,988
I don't get it.

1534
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:37,388
Think about it from that guy's
point of view, okay?

1535
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:38,471
The guy who died.

1536
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:39,670
He's lying there on the ground,

1537
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:41,509
staring up at the sky, near death,

1538
01:15:41,632 --> 01:15:43,752
and then former president
Richard Nixon appears before him

1539
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:44,912
and tells him he's gonna be fine.

1540
01:15:45,031 --> 01:15:47,873
Now, did he think that's normal, right,

1541
01:15:47,992 --> 01:15:50,630
that before they die, everybody sees Nixon?

1542
01:15:50,753 --> 01:15:52,550
You're expecting an angel and you get Nixon.

1543
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,152
-Exactly. Right?
-Yeah.

1544
01:15:54,271 --> 01:15:56,994
It's the same situation,
just a vastly different point of view.

1545
01:15:57,113 --> 01:15:58,353
So there's two ways to look at something.

1546
01:15:58,472 --> 01:15:59,394
Yeah.

1547
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:00,554
That's the point of the story?

1548
01:16:00,673 --> 01:16:01,595
-Yeah.
-Yeah, just say that.

1549
01:16:01,714 --> 01:16:02,632
What?

1550
01:16:02,755 --> 01:16:04,832
Well, you just lead me on this
epic fucking journey with this story,

1551
01:16:04,955 --> 01:16:07,555
and 10 minutes later, the point is
that there's two ways to look at something.

1552
01:16:07,674 --> 01:16:09,314
Just... You could just say that.

1553
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:10,593
You didn't like that story?

1554
01:16:12,993 --> 01:16:14,514
-That would be awful.
-Wouldn't it, right?

1555
01:16:14,633 --> 01:16:16,315
-Yeah.
-It would suck, right?

1556
01:16:16,434 --> 01:16:17,794
-Oh.
-HOLLAND: Hey.

1557
01:16:17,917 --> 01:16:19,077
Thank God.

1558
01:16:19,196 --> 01:16:21,915

-Oh!

Sorry. Mrs Glenn, I need you
to take us to Misty's house.

1737
01:27:31,918 --> 01:27:33,478
I need you to show us exactly what you saw.

1738

MRS GLENN: There. There.
That's the window.

1739
01:27:41,838 --> 01:27:43,359
I was coming around that corner

1740
01:27:43,478 --> 01:27:45,840

You did see your niece, Mrs Glenn.

1749
01:28:07,961 --> 01:28:11,483
You saw her on that wall,
at a desk, in a pinstriped suit.

1750
01:28:11,602 --> 01:28:14,682
So what she saw was a movie?

1751
01:28:14,801 --> 01:28:16,683
Not a movie. The movie.

1752
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:20,043
-The movie.
-But the film burned up.

1753
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:23,765
Well, how did she see it
two days after it supposedly burned up?

1754
01:28:23,884 --> 01:28:25,685
And the wardrobe matches perfectly.

1755

She had a copy?

Wouldn't you?

1757
01:28:30,324 --> 01:28:32,444
And she gave that copy to Misty.

1758
01:28:33,404 --> 01:28:34,526
So she comes here,

1759
01:28:34,645 --> 01:28:36,285

1761
01:28:38,285 --> 01:28:40,644

And goes where?
