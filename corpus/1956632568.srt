1
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,860
It's Morning in America, and I'm
having myself one lucky day.

2
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Ah! Ah! Oh! Ah!

3
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,820
(glass shattering)

4
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,699
Forgot to feed the plants.

5
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Maybe it's you who needs a feeding.

6
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,859
The engine is running now.

7
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,619
You're built like a shit brick house.

8
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,620
I'm riding you... riding you like a...
like a...

9
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,820
Oh!

10
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,059
Ride 'em, cowboy! ...Oh, doggie!

11
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,179
Oh yeah!

12
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,179
(gunshots)

13
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,180
Yee-haw! ...Ride "em, cowboy!

14
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,780
(gunshots)

15
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,940
Oh!

16
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,180
Yes!

17
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,660
(giggles)

18
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,020
Touchdown!

19
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,940
(marching band music plays)

20
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,299
I could hear Camille all the way
down the hall last night.

21
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,939
Don't want to brag or nothin'.

22
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,499
Well, Kevin, you owe me a game of
H-O-R-S-E for setting you up.

23
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,899
Wish I could, but I got
urgent business.

24
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,779
What the fuck is that?

25
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,179
"Cindy Does SINcinnati," huh?

26
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,579
Where did you get this?

27
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,979
A high school buddy.
With these VCRs, it's like having a

28
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,019
porn theater in your own dorm room.

29
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Man, oh, man. Cindy's got the biggest
jugs this side of the Rio Grande.

30
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,419
Put it on.

31
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,420
I don't know, Justin. I'm not sure you
would enjoy it as much as I would.

32
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,299
Oh! Yes!

33
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,300
All guys go through phases like this.
Mine's just taking longer than usual.

34
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,979
Aren't you done yet?

35
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,419
When you're bigger than Dallas,
it takes longer

36
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,420
Oh, man. Look at Cindy's bush.

37
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,139
Want to try some lube?

38
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,140
.

39
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,099
I'll show you.

40
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,139
(slippery sounds)

41
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,339
What the fuck are you doing, dude?

42
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,340
Nothing.

43
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,379
Where did you get that shit?

44
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,380
Just keep your eyes on her.

45
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,219
Oh!

46
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,979
Here it comes.

47
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,779
Here it comes.

48
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Oh! Oh!

49
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,579
Good flick.

50
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,580
A classic is a classic.

51
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,020
So...what's the plan Saturday?

52
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,539
The girls are going to be in Austin
for the game by 6.

53
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,059
You provide the wheels -
I provide the brewskies.

54
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,379
Pickups, pussy and Longhorns football.
It don't get better than that!

55
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,380
(splat sound)

56
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,059
Man, I wish I could have made it down
to the game on Saturday.

57
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,099
Man, I wish I could have made it down
to the game on Saturday.

58
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,139
And I wish I could have made it
up to the cabin.

59
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,219
Come on, dude. We ain't seen each
other since this summer.

60
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,619
Danny is going to be here, too.

61
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,099
They give you guys a whole week
for fall break?

62
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,379
Give or take a day. Or two. Or three.

63
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,499
Someone needs to get serious
about their education.

64
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,979
I'll turn queer before that happens.

65
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,859
Too late, boy. You're already queer

66
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,379
Eat me - whole.

67
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,619
I love our guy talk.

68
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,259
Steve, I got a couple of midterms
coming up.

69
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,059
You can study here.

70
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,619
That dog don't hunt.

71
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,579
Did I mention there was going to be
pussy involved?

72
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,579
Pussy-a-plenty.

73
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,099
I'll think about it.

74
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,139
- Pussy-o-rama.
- I'm thinking about it.

75
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,579
Pussy galore!

76
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,580
<i>I see your intention through
your dark-blue denim jeans</i>

77
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,860
<i>Any more intention
you'd be bursting at the seams</i>

78
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,979
There you are, Kev.

79
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,019
Camille has been asking about you.

80
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,419
Oh yeah?
I've been meaning to call her

81
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,059
(laughs hysterically)

82
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,299
Holy shit!

83
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,179
What's got your goat now?

84
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,979
Will you be my date for the fall
dance, Kevie-kins?

85
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,339
If dumb were dirt,
you'd cover an acre.

86
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,899
Well, if brains was dynamite, you
couldn't blow your nose.

87
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,900
It's "Wear Jeans If You're Gay Day,"
numb nuts.

88
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Yeah. Run. You better hurry now.
Hurry on.

89
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,619
Hi there.

90
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,299
Haven't seen you around the dorm
before,

91
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,300
I'm new... Cesar.

92
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,579
Kevin.

93
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,580
Nice to meet you, Kevin,

94
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,339
You know, "It's Wear Jeans If
You're Gay Day."

95
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,939
Of course.

96
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,579
I organized it

97
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,659
Oh... shit. That's cool.

98
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,699
Strange how everyone's jeans seem
to be in the laundry today.

99
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,379
There's plenty of room at the table.

100
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,859
No - Twas just hunting for my pencil.

101
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Oh, here it is. Well, nice meeting
you and all.

102
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,099
(moaning sounds on TV)

103
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,299
That's Cesar's probably lurking at
some rest stop this very minute, or

104
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,300
sniffing jock straps at the gym.

105
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,260
What that poor boy must
be going through.

106
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,299
Back to blue jeans, I see.

107
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,179
Hi.

108
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,180
You mind if I join you?

109
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,739
It's Caesar, right?

110
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,740
It's Cesar. I didn't mean to disturb
you. My roommate needs his privacy.

111
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,819
Is he...?

112
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,579
He's got about 10 girlfriends.
Sometimes all in the same weekend.

113
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,139
Sounds pretty healthy to me.

114
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,939
If you're into that kind of thing.

115
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,940
Hey! Why aren't you at the Saloon?

116
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,579
Excuse me, Tinkerbell. This is a
fag-free zone,

117
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,659
Geez, Justin.
Give the guy a break.

118
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,779
Don't listen to him,
You can stay if you want.

119
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,779
Think I'd rather go.

120
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,339
Bye, Kevin.

121
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Bye, Kevin. You better hurry!
Hurry on.

122
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,859
He didn't do anything to you.
What's your problem?

123
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,579
You ain't heard, obviously.

124
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,379
Heard what?

125
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,539
He got kicked out of Sigma Nu for
getting down with one of the pledges.

126
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,939
And I'm not talking about
a sorority sister.

127
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,059
Are you shitting me?

128
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,019
Had a gallon's worth of semen pumped
from his stomach because he was

129
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,219
sucking so much cock.

130
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,139
That's fucked up.

131
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:27,140
He'd been smoking your pole if
I hadn't rescued your ass.

132
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,260
I enjoy Western Civ. It makes me
think deep thoughts.

133
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Man - I could really use a blow job.

134
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,659
Your thesis statement is bland.
It doesn't say anything.

135
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,219
Well, maybe it's because the book is
bland.

136
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,419
I mean, the author spent four pages
describing a tree.

137
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,699
A fucking tree!

138
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,059
Then say that. Without the fucking
reference, of course.

139
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,619
I'm telling you, if you wrote like
you spoke, you could get an A.

140
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,859
- Oh, no. Not this nitwit.
- You know that guy?

141
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,339
He's in my English class.

142
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,579
Howdy, ma'am.

143
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,979
Knee-deep in Willa Cather here.

144
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,619
That Willa dude don't make no sense to
me, you know?

145
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,379
Maybe you could help
me with my homework sometime.

146
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,179
I suggest that you take lessons
from my brilliant tutor here.

147
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,379
Yes, ma'am.,

148
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,739
You seen Kevin, Tinkerbell?

149
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,019
Excuse me?

150
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,019
Your boyfriend.

151
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,419
Why don't you fuck off?

152
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,979
You mean the guy who isn't a
complete homophobic idiot?

153
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,339
Yeah.

154
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,739
No - haven't seen him.

155
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,579
You ever want to study together...

156
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,459
- I'm game.
- Bye now.

157
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,699
If you change your mind...

158
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,699
Do I look like I'm going to
change my mind?

159
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,700
All right. I'm going.

160
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,419
(knocking at door)

161
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,859
Come in,

162
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,860
- No time for hoops, dude.
- Who said anything about baseball?

163
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,380
I brought you some cookies...
for defending me the other day.

164
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,899
Thank you.

165
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,459
I don't think anyone should talk to
anyone like that.

166
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,460
It's disrespectful, you know?

167
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,899
You play football?

168
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,259
Lettered my junior and senior year.

169
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,819
What position did you play?

170
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,179
Wide receiver I had a good
pair of hands.

171
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,339
Bet Miss December here
appreciates that.

172
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,819
In my humble opinion, she should have
been Playmate of the Year

173
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,139
I had my money on Miss October.

174
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,739
No comment.

175
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,899
- You're one of those liberals.
- Try it. You'll like it.

176
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,939
Who are these guys?

177
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,059
The guy on the left, that's Danny,
my best friend.

178
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,099
The guy in the middle is Steve,
my other best friend.

179
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,859
Danny's the intellectual one.
Steve's the lady-killer.

180
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,019
And what are you?

181
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,179
Just your average good ol' boy.

182
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,819
Who can charm the skin off
a rattlesnake.

183
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,419
Nah.

184
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,139
And you know it...

185
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,219
Dangerous.

186
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,379
Did you do these?

187
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,659
I'm in a class this semester..
just for fun.

188
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,219
They're really good.

189
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,019
Thanks.

190
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,099
Can I sketch you?

191
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,779
Sketch me?

192
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,739
I need to practice human
subjects for my class.

193
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,419
Uhh, sure. I guess so.

194
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,420
The thing is, you have to be naked.

195
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,059
Just what I need.

196
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,859
I was hoping you'd come back here.

197
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,579
What brings you back so soon?

198
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,659
Cesar promised to meet me after
dinner.

199
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,379
We got interrupted this afternoon...

200
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,619
If you catch my drift.

201
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Come on, don't Cesar freak you out,
just a little bit?

202
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,659
There is absolutely no reason
for me to stay.

203
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,979
Well, I was hoping maybe we could
study together, you know, knock back a

204
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,980
couple of beers.

205
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,220
I'm curious. Just how many grades
did you flunk?

206
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,459
Only two.

207
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:54,460
Why?

208
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,380
I'm kind of modest, at least when
I don't know someone that well.

209
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,739
Should I close my eyes?

210
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,339
I'm just asking... My mom always
taught me to be polite.

211
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,339
So be polite and tell me I'm not
too damn skinny.

212
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,259
I like skinny... it's easier to draw.

213
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,819
Wish I was more built, but...

214
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,859
What's that?

215
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,379
For the newspaper.

216
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,699
I'm teasing.

217
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,099
I need some sort of visual reference
to finish the drawing.

218
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,499
Only when I know you better.

219
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,500
You're the boss.

220
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,700
(sketching sounds)

221
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,659
Wow.

222
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,660
He... He ain't got nothing I ain't
seen in gym class.

223
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Are you going to stare or draw?

224
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Can you move for me ever so
slightly, partner?

225
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,699
How am I doing?

226
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,259
You were born to do this.

227
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,260
So tell me, Mr. Artiste, why do
models have to be nude?

228
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,459
The lines...

229
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,460
Underwear interrupts the V line
between the stomach and groin.

230
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,019
I'm guessing this ain't your
first rodeo.

231
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,020
Don't know what you mean.

232
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,459
What are you doing?

233
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,299
I should ask you the same question.

234
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,300
You can't just kiss me like that.

235
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,419
What was I thinking?

236
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,699
Look, I'm just not that kind
of guy, that's all.

237
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,779
So your hand just happened to
wander down there, right?

238
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,579
I was just getting a sense
of proportion for the sketch.

239
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,259
You're completely delusional.

240
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,659
I'm sorry you got the wrong idea.

241
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,619
No hard feelings, OK?

242
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,379
You're nothing but a closet whore.

243
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,380
You're calling ME a whore?

244
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,299
Don't come near me!

245
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,819
(door slamming)

246
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,820
I can't believe I let him take
advantage of me like that.

247
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,819
Yee-hah, dude!
The girls are bringing along a hot

248
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,499
little number named Susannah just for
you.

249
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,219
There's no way I can
come to the cabin.

250
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,459
She's a sure thing, Kev...

251
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,379
A sure thing.

252
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,899
Are you all right, buddy?

253
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,899
Uh, huh.

254
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,499
You'd tell me if you weren't, right?

255
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,819
Right?

256
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,979
I don't know.

257
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,339
Haven't had much luck with
sure things lately.

258
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,979
She was a semifinalist for the Dallas
Cowboy cheerleaders, Kev.

259
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,939
A semifinalist, can you fuckin'
believe that?

260
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,019
- Do you know what that means?
- What does it mean?

261
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,020
It means she almost made the team.

262
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,739
Hi.

263
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,939
Your roommate tearing up the
sheets again?

264
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,819
Go away.

265
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,899
Cesar - don't be sore at me.

266
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,900
I miss everyone at home, and you're
the coolest person I've met here.

267
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,859
I can talk to you.

268
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,859
Smooth.

269
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,619
I mean every word I'm saying.

270
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,459
You're trouble - with a capital T.

271
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,460
This is Freddie. That one's Jimmy.
And that's Dolores.

272
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,619
You name your plants?

273
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,779
It's the closest thing I could have
to pets growing up.

274
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,459
My parents were funny that way.

275
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,539
They're OK, though.

276
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,539
You're lucky.

277
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,939
You mind if I take a quick shower?

278
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,419
Uhh...

279
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,339
I need to go get some studying done.

280
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,859
Oh, no. Stay.

281
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,539
I won't be long.

282
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Have a seat.

283
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,460
I'll just...watch your plants.

284
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Here's some good reading
to occupy you.

285
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,300
A sense of humor.

286
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,619
Lots of good articles in there.

287
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,620
Check out these bazookas.

288
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,139
So why shower now?

289
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,099
The bathroom is less crowded at night.

290
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,379
I'm very shy.

291
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Should I close my eyes?

292
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,780
Too late.

293
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,219
Can't find my shaving creme.

294
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,779
- You see it anywhere?
- I never learn my lesson.

295
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,499
What did you say?

296
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,579
Why do you have to be
so damn irresistible?

297
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,899
Guys don't say that to guys, Cesar.
Especially when they're naked.

298
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,219
Then come get your robe.

299
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,220
You are in deep doo-doo, pal.

300
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,859
You're fucking strong.

301
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,539
Damn straight.

302
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,540
Don't pull any fast ones, señor.

303
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,460
(moaning)

304
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,179
Brenda. Baby, don't go.

305
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,859
I told you, sweetie. I got to meet
Daddy on campus tomorrow at 7.

306
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,899
Are you dating me, or your Daddy?

307
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,219
Be patient.

308
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,659
You fuck so good!

309
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,299
You sure have a way with words.

310
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,779
You're gonna hurry back, promise?

311
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,780
Me and the girls will be here Friday.
But I'm not sharing you, you hear?

312
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,380
(laughing)

313
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,339
Can I stay the night?

314
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,979
Someone's going to see you.

315
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,980
So what?

316
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,260
Just this one time - and don't you
go blabbing around about this.

317
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,659
You're hotter than a billy goat
in a pepper patch.

318
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,219
You're making fun of me.

319
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,699
Never.

320
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,700
Night.

321
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Cesar?

322
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,860
I'm in bed with a homosexual.

323
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,979
(knocking on door)

324
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,579
Come in,

325
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,580
(door opening)

326
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,539
Morning.

327
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,699
Courtesy of the dorm cafeteria.

328
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,779
It's the thought that counts.

329
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,259
Thank you...I'm starving.

330
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,659
Just like Granny used to make them.

331
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,859
You always rise and shine this early?

332
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,739
Only if I'm really, really up for it.

333
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,339
Speaking of up...

334
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,099
You fixin' to get me
into more trouble?

335
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,499
Tonight.
Got to go...

336
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Missed a tutoring appointment last
night, so I have to go make it up.

337
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,419
Look both ways before you leave.

338
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,420
I'll just tell them you're one of
my students. That's true, right?

339
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Wow. If he were a girl, I'd be riding
a gravy train with biscuit wheels.

340
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,499
Hey, cum guzzler!

341
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,339
Jesus! You heard of knocking?

342
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,819
Who put a bug up your ass?

343
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,820
No one.

344
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,819
You look guilty about something.

345
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,379
I was studying all night.

346
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,619
Do you mind?!

347
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,779
I knew it!

348
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,459
I can smell the pussy a mile away.
You dog! You hound dog!

349
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,099
Tell me all about it! Was it Camille?

350
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,899
It was Camille, wasn't it?

351
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,259
Is there a hole in the bed?
Oh my God!

352
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,499
Get out of here! You're crazy!

353
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,379
Come on, we're gonna go play hoops.

354
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,259
Be right there.

355
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:04,260
In comparing Willa Cather to Edgar
Allen Poe, we must first examine their

356
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,819
relationship to the reader as
seen through the...

357
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,419
Are you high?

358
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,339
No...I'm fine,

359
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,659
Who is he?

360
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,259
No one.

361
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I'm just in a good mood, that's all.

362
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,419
What's your favorite song of all time?

363
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,899
Don't laugh.

364
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,019
"Sailing." Christopher Cross.

365
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,899
I love that song.

366
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,699
- Get out of here.
- I'm serious.

367
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,700
- Want me to sing it for yow?
- No. No. No. No. No. I believe you.

368
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,339
I used to play it on my boom box
all the time, tending cattle.

369
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,340
It made me feel there was this world
of possibilities out there for me.

370
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,219
But you're a smart guy, Cesar. You can
do anything you set your mind to.

371
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,219
No.

372
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,099
Yes.

373
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,979
Wish you tutored in accounting, too.

374
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,939
You should be an art major.

375
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,459
That's not practical, man.

376
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,019
You care about being
practical too much.

377
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,020
And you're stubborn as an ox.

378
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,459
Did you mean it when you said I'm the
coolest person you've met here?

379
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,419
Or was that just bullshit?

380
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,979
That was just bullshit.

381
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,259
Of course I meant it.

382
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,579
Just didn't want you gettin'
ideas, is all.

383
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,659
What ideas?

384
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,660
You know - ideas.

385
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,299
Danny...

386
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,300
Take your coat off. Stay awhile.

387
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,899
Want a beer?

388
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,059
When is Kevin getting here?

389
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,899
Well - I'm still working on him.

390
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,019
Steve!

391
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,859
After all this trouble?

392
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,419
Mellow out, Danny.

393
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,179
I'm doin' my best here.

394
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,459
Well, what did he say?

395
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,179
Nothing.

396
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,019
But I got a hunch...

397
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,020
I think our Kevie boy may
be falling in love.

398
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,379
Close your eyes.

399
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,379
What does it matter? They're already
covered shut.

400
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,939
Are they closed?

401
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,019
Yeah.

402
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,699
If you're pulling my leg,
you will pay.

403
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,259
Keep them closed.

404
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,260
And no peeking.

405
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,340
You were warned.

406
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,659
I don't know what to say.

407
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,059
Don't say anything.

408
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,659
I gotta be somewhere, OK?

409
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,979
Kevin!

410
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,739
Yee-hah! A wise choice, my friend.

411
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,099
Should be there in a few hours.

412
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,219
What's wrong with you? You sound like
you just ran the 880 relay.

413
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,499
I'm rushing to beat the weather.

414
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,499
You hear about those storms coming?

415
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,179
What's a little rain? It's gonna be
a weekend we never forget.

416
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,099
I'm counting on it.

417
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,859
Did I tell you how stacked
Susannah was?

418
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,019
Three times.

419
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,459
Hurry, dude. Girls are gonna be...

420
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,699
Yeah!

421
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,059
What changed his mind?

422
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,699
What else?

423
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Snatch!

424
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,380
It's good to be out in the open.
Gives me perspective.

425
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,579
<i>Need to take some time away
to get my thoughts together</i>

426
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,059
<i>But I need to go right now
so I can make it past the weather</i>

427
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,179
<i>Storm is coming round the bend
and I'm looking for the sun</i>

428
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,739
<i>Cause nothin' makes no sense
right now</i>

429
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,179
<i>and it's time
for me to run</i>

430
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Ooooooh

431
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Truth is, Cesar's a great guy,
a true friend.

432
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,979
I mean, just cause he Kind of tricked
me into all this doesn't mean

433
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,980
he's a bad person.

434
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,939
More than anything now, I need to be
with my kind of people.

435
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,940
Get things straightened out.

436
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,540
Anybody home?

437
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,780
Hello?

438
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,979
- You made it!
- Hey, bud!

439
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,539
What's up!
Mua!

440
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,819
Get the hell off me!

441
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,419
- You love it.
- In your wet dreams.

442
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,499
- Hi, Kevin!
- Hey, Danny!

443
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,859
It's Daniel now.

444
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,259
Daniel?

445
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,739
Don't let Mr. Preppie Pants fool you,
he's still our Danny boy.

446
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,019
I'm not a preppie.

447
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,779
And I'm not naked.

448
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,459
Can't wait to meet this Carla
girl of yours, Danny.

449
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,699
Uhh, Daniel.

450
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,379
We've been going together two months.

451
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,339
Cool.

452
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,659
From the pictures Steve sent, it looks
like you both got foxes.

453
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,499
Oh yeah!

454
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,499
With any luck this weekend, big Danny
boy's going to lose his V.

455
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,739
Fuck you!
It's already happened.

456
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,739
Yeah. Right.

457
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,099
Get him under control, would you?
I got some cooking to do.

458
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,819
I'm glad you made it, man.

459
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,179
Brings back a lot of memories.

460
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,019
I hope you are ready for Susannah.

461
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,339
You have no idea.

462
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:26,340
You got to check out my new zebra
bedspread, man. It's awesome.

463
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,259
Bet the chicks love it.

464
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,579
Oh yeah!

465
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,379
Brenda went ape fuckin' orgasmic
on the thing the other night...

466
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,219
That girl - she knows how
to turn it on!

467
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,219
Would you put something on, dude?

468
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,259
Yeah. How's that?

469
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,459
You're too much.

470
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,419
I don't know what it is, Kevin...

471
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,819
Something about you brings out
my frisky side.

472
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,379
Why you putting those tapes away?

473
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,259
The first rule when girls come over..

474
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,699
You gotta de-porn the premises.

475
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,819
"Cindy Does SINcinnati"
turned out handy.

476
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,820
Cindy never disappoints.

477
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,740
He's still got a bod - not that I'm
thinking about it.

478
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,379
What's on your mind, man?

479
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,659
Nothing.

480
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,939
Now don't bullshit a bullshitter.

481
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,299
I'm not bullshitting you.

482
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:28,300
You know I'll find out.

483
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,899
(laughing)

484
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,499
Oh remember..

485
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,099
Remember when we were in junior high
school, and Kevin started

486
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,459
that Playboy club?

487
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,059
That was a whole lot of nothin'.

488
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,979
He used to have all the boys come
over, and we'd have to jerk off so

489
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,899
that we could see the centerfolds.

490
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,499
Did you really do that, or is he
just making that up?

491
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,499
Don't listen to him. He's always
running his mouth.

492
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,579
Danny, you were there.

493
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,580
Oh no, that's right. You weren't cause
you were too much of a pussy to join.

494
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,419
Not all of us were sex maniacs.

495
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,579
Danny. You didn't even know
what jerking off was.

496
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,419
I just learned by myself,
like regular people do.

497
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,459
What's with you?

498
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,339
Kevin?

499
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,339
What are you playing with there?

500
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,579
Nothing.

501
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,259
Did you buy Susannah a necklace?

502
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,099
Ain't that sweet? Let me see it.

503
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,819
Give me a break.

504
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,579
Oh, I see...

505
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,379
I think Kevin here is getting some
back at the dorm and not letting on.

506
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,459
What you think, Danny?

507
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,339
I think you're right.

508
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,219
(laughs)

509
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,539
Come on man.

510
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,899
(laughter fades out)

511
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,900
What in tarnation possessed me
to bring this thing?

512
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Well, at least he left a note...

513
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,980
Better than dumping you mid-blow-job
like that asshole at Sigma Nu.

514
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,859
I need to get laid.

515
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,899
Now.

516
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,539
No, baby-cakes. What you need to do
is stop forcing things.

517
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,540
Chasing unavailable men is not good
for your mental health.

518
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,539
Fine...Will you marry me?

519
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,499
I would...

520
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,979
But you're a total fag,
and I'm a total bitch.

521
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,980
We just couldn't get our children
into the good schools.

522
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,540
48... 49..,

523
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,419
Girls set to go?

524
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,939
Oh yep.

525
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,019
They're leaving first thing
in the morning.

526
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,139
And don't blow your wad tonight.

527
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,259
Susannah's gonna need a fill-up.

528
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,579
I'll do my best.

529
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,580
(thunder crashing)

530
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,420
It's great to feel like one of the
guys again.

531
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,460
(thunder crashing)

532
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,420
Sorry, Susannah.

533
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,939
Wake up, ladies.

534
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,459
There's been a change in plans.

535
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,499
Now you all aren't
going to believe this.

536
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,539
Half of Texas flooded away last night.

537
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,540
What?

538
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,939
Danny, he's yanking our chain.

539
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,059
No! All the roads up into
here just washed away.

540
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,939
- Are you serious?
- That's impossible.

541
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,739
Go check the news then.

542
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,299
They did say the rivers were cresting.

543
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,739
Uh, huh.

544
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,819
They had record rains this fall.

545
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,539
Uh, huh.

546
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,859
This can't be happening.

547
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,019
Hold it. If the roads are washed out,
does that mean we're trapped here?

548
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,219
Uh, huh.

549
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,139
What about the girls?

550
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,299
What about the food?

551
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,139
Fuck the food! What about the girls?

552
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,219
Well, they're safe at home, but...

553
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,459
Looks like we're on our own
for the weekend.

554
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,779
(door knocking)

555
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,979
Howdy.

556
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,819
What do you want?

557
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,579
Hell of a storm last night, huh?

558
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,459
Uh, huh.

559
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,379
It usually don't happen
this time of year.

560
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,539
If you're looking for Kevin, he's
high-tailed it out of here.

561
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,139
I wasn't looking for Kevin, shit for
brains. I was looking for you.

562
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,659
Could we go someplace else?

563
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,779
What?

564
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,779
Anyone could just walk in here.

565
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,739
I'm confused.

566
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,740
Kevin's room is empty.

567
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,059
It's 10 a.m.

568
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,019
You're almost as bad as Danny.

569
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,979
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,980
What are we going to do with
ourselves all weekend?

571
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,779
I am so fuckin' bored.

572
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,099
I'm gonna go hunt us some food.

573
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,899
Well, if it ain't Davy fuckin'
Crockett.

574
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,099
Guess what, Steve?
If there was food in the fridge, I

575
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,739
wouldn't have to resort to this.

576
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,859
All right, Danny. Let's not get our
panties in a wad.

577
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,779
We need to be staying on
higher ground.

578
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,499
Yeah. OK. Al right.

579
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,539
Bye.

580
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,579
I worry about that boy sometimes.
He's a little...

581
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,099
Maybe we should help him.

582
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,499
Nah. He'll be fine.

583
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,819
Besides - this gives us a
golden opportunity.

584
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,539
What you mean?

585
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,699
"Dixie Does Dallas" - the long, long
awaited sequel to

586
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,099
"Cindy Does SINcinatti."

587
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,579
I don't feel comfortable in this room.

588
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,099
He ain't going to mind if we're here.

589
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,659
I'm feeding his faggy plants.

590
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,659
What's he doing?

591
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,660
Chasing pussy.

592
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,540
What exactly do you want?

593
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:49,180
To pass English.

594
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,620
Can you get me a Coke?

595
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,740
(phone ringing)

596
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:07,740
(phone ringing)

597
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,059
(phone ringing)

598
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,659
Steve!

599
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,459
(phone ringing)

600
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,619
I'm in here taking a dump.
Would you get it?

601
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:24,939
(phone ringing)

602
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,339
Hello.

603
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,699
Thanks for blowing me off with
that chicken-shit note.

604
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,899
Cesar - hi.

605
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,299
Don't "hi" me, closet whore,

606
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,899
How did you get this number?

607
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,059
Don't avoid the issue.
I need my ring back.

608
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,819
You'll get it.

609
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,779
But - can't we still be friends?

610
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,419
I don't take this shit from friends.

611
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,859
(toilet flushing)

612
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,579
I'm sorry - we just want different
things out of life.

613
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,179
Don't be mad.

614
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,659
How's that pussy working out for you?

615
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,899
Huh?

616
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,379
I want my ring back.

617
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,619
(phone hanging up)

618
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,779
Girl trouble?

619
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,619
Sort of.

620
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,739
A good wank will help you forget.

621
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,419
I do need to forget, that's for sure.

622
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,539
I hope you jerk-offs
worked up an appetite.

623
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:22,059
I shot a turkey!

624
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,179
Why's it called "My Antonio"?

625
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,459
It's "My Antonia."

626
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,819
You just get off on teaching,
don't you?

627
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,499
Maybe.

628
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,259
Your essay needs to focus
on point of view.

629
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,899
It starts out in the voice of
Antonia's childhood friend,

630
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,939
who's a man.

631
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,419
Now we may be seeing
through his eyes...

632
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,779
But the main character is...

633
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,459
Antonia.

634
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,059
You're not serious about this.

635
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,739
Tam.

636
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,899
My old man will fuckin' skin me alive
if I don't pass this class.

637
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,779
Then what are you doing?

638
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,139
I was kind of hoping...

639
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,859
You could write the paper yourself.

640
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,139
Help me impress your girl pal, too.

641
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,899
Fuck you.

642
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,459
You really outdone yourself, boy.

643
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,699
You really outdone yourself, boy.

644
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,219
Eat up, dude.

645
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,059
Those frat boys really taught
you how to cook.

646
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:28,060
Hey.

647
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,900
Why don't you have a beer?

648
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,539
He's right. You earned it.

649
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,299
Oh, I forgot. Danny boy can't
hold his liquor.

650
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,659
Daniel.

651
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,979
Well, I'll be dipped in shit.

652
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,379
Do my Lone Star eyes deceive me?

653
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,379
I told you, I've changed.

654
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,459
Alright alright.

655
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,539
I propose a toast...

656
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,619
To Texas football.

657
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,419
Eating pussy.

658
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:06,059
And to drinking beer with Danny,
all night long.

659
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,819
(bottles clank)

660
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:14,820
(dishes clanking)

661
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,099
Don't strain yourself with the dishes.

662
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,100
I got to save up my energy
- for Dixie.

663
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,459
Are you really drunk,
or just that homy?

664
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,459
You've got to check out that
mechanical bull scene.

665
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,460
That girl on girl action. Don't tell
me that's not hot.

666
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,939
Danny's right in the next room.

667
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,219
That boy's so plastered unconscious,
he could sleep through a tornado.

668
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,859
Thanks to you.

669
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,819
Since when do you turn down
a night with Dixie?

670
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,339
This ain't high school anymore.

671
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,779
Best years of our lives, dude.

672
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,219
Best years of our lives.

673
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,059
Where you going?

674
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,060
To get us some reinforcements.

675
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,659
(moaning sounds from TV)

676
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,979
Go! Dixie! Go!

677
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,179
Yeah! Look at those titties!

678
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,180
Oh yeah!

679
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,299
Help me out! I want to shoot so hard,
it hit the window!

680
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,619
Come on!

681
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,419
It would be rude not to help out
a friend in need.

682
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:37,420
This one's for Dixie.

683
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,339
Oh yeah!

684
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,899
Yeah!

685
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,819
Slower.

686
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,579
Faster.

687
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,859
This is what normal, red-blooded
American boys do, right?

688
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,339
Why can't Cesar see that?

689
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,340
OHHHHH!

690
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,180
(cows mooing)

691
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:16,060
Mom?

692
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:22,140
Sounds like you were having
a nightmare.

693
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,619
I'm so hung over.

694
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:30,620
Figures. You had two whole
beers last night.

695
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:36,340
Did I miss anything?

696
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:41,700
Nah.

697
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,179
Good morning to you.

698
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,859
Don't leave when I'm trying to talk
to you. That really pisses me off.

699
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,019
This is a fag-free zone, remember?

700
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,059
Sit the fuck down.

701
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,259
Look, I have been reading
this shit all night.

702
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,779
And it don't make one
lick of sense to me.

703
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,379
You're wasting your time.

704
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,380
What I gotta do to change your mind?

705
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,819
Bathroom's yours.

706
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,739
Drinking again?

707
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,819
Where's Danny?

708
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,339
Out chopping wood.

709
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,299
Could you do me a favor?

710
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,219
My Dad would have beat the shit
out of me if I was queer.

711
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:42,220
Don't keep saying words like that!
It bugs me.

712
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,420
This is the type of shit you pulled
at Sigma Nu, isn't it?

713
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,539
If everyone thinks that,
it must be true.

714
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,859
What would Kevin think about
you doing this, huh?

715
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,659
Like I give a shit what Kevin thinks.

716
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,859
Then why you start acting like
a greased pig every time

717
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,739
his name comes up?

718
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,139
Would you shut your trap about Kevin?

719
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,699
We ain't got till Christmas.

720
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,419
Oh my God! Oh!

721
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,179
The message is clear.

722
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,739
I need to find me a steady gal.

723
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,259
Oh Lord!

724
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,859
You're better than Brenda.

725
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,499
Holy shit!

726
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,939
Hi, Danny.

727
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,419
I told you, it's Daniel.

728
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,019
Five typed pages.

729
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:47,020
Double spaced.

730
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,019
Draw, faggot.

731
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,979
Who said anything about drawing?

732
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,819
This is getting kind of queer, guys.

733
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,979
You calling me a queer, Danny boy?

734
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,579
No. All I'm asking...

735
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,580
What were you doin'
under the covers, Kev?

736
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,579
Here it is!

737
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,299
I thought you put it under the covers.

738
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,939
I told you it was there!

739
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,619
I told him it was there.

740
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,299
We was just fixin' to watch Dixie take
on the football team...

741
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,979
Not that you'd have any interest
or clue about things like that.

742
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,819
Why do you keep doing this stuff
behind my back...

743
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,819
Not including me?

744
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,179
Well. Because you're repressed.

745
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:44,180
I am not repressed.

746
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,139
Repressed.

747
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:52,140
Fine. I'll show you repressed.

748
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,059
Bring it on, Dixie!

749
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,819
This is really getting...

750
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,699
Gay.

751
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,579
You wanna blow me,
is that what you want?

752
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,939
That's worth two pages.

753
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,419
Maybe.

754
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,499
No - get the fuck away from
me. I'd rather flunk.

755
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,379
Fair enough.

756
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,619
Wait.

757
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,579
OK...

758
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,539
But I'm pitching. You ain't doin'
shit to me.

759
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,540
Unless it's a blow job.

760
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,499
Get dressed.

761
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,939
This is some fucked-up shit.

762
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,299
Quiet. I'm trying to concentrate
on Dixie.

763
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,779
What are you doing?

764
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,819
Don't want the sheets
to get messed up.

765
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,459
Danny - will you assist me
for a minute?

766
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,099
No way!

767
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,619
OK. I was just kidding.

768
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,859
Go, Dixie!

769
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,259
Yeah, baby! Ride me!

770
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,699
Ride me!

771
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,739
Woo! You're a lot bigger than I
remember, Danny.

772
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,859
- Really?
- Yeah.

773
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,259
I'm getting close.

774
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,619
No. No. No.

775
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,459
We gotta synchronize.

776
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,979
Ready?

777
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,539
One...

778
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,179
Two...

779
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,459
Three.

780
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,379
Go!

781
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,259
Oh! Oh!

782
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,099
I brought groceries.

783
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,579
Aaah!

784
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,579
I'm sorry. I really am...

785
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,579
Let's get this over with, all right?
Come on.

786
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,580
I'll help you, but you have to
write the paper yourself.

787
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,499
I got butt naked for you, dick breath.
You owe me.

788
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,179
I could have had you...

789
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,059
But I never really would have had you.

790
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,219
What the fuck does that mean?

791
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:02,179
I've heard of guys night out,
but come on.

792
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,499
Brenda. Baby.
We were just watching some porn.

793
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,179
Well, I'm glad to know it's not a job.

794
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,859
Please don't tell Carla
about any of this.

795
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:15,860
Whose idea was this?

796
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,139
How'd you get here, hon?

797
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:23,139
Four-whee! drive. And I gotta be back
tonight, so start explain'.

798
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,179
Dixie here was our only company, mam.

799
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,179
Can you toss me my sweats?
I don't feel very well.

800
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,419
Baby, come on.
Let me make it up to you.

801
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,979
Oh, geez. I give up. You can fake the
frat boys out of the frat...

802
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,099
But you can't take the frat
out the boys.

803
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:45,100
Brenda...
(thud)

804
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,419
You tell anybody about this...

805
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,779
I'll beat the shit out of you.

806
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,299
That's not going to help you pass
English, tough guy.

807
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,979
Not Willa Cather.

808
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,699
I think I'd rather get fucked
in the ass.

809
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,779
Where were we?

810
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:02,780
Yeah! Just like that! Oh!

811
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,740
I reckon they made up.

812
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:19,019
Why you putting the scouring
powder in the fridge?

813
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:24,020
Shit.

814
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,259
I really wasn't into it.

815
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,579
You know?

816
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:39,580
What are you talking about?

817
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:45,420
Pass me the turkey leftovers,
would you?

818
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Damn it!

819
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,899
Danny, guys do this stuff
all the time.

820
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,179
It don't mean nothin'.

821
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,059
They do?

822
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,379
Sure. Even guys with girlfriends.

823
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:19,380
Especially guys with girlfriends.

824
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,139
I can't write this paper.

825
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,939
Yes, you can.

826
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,539
You really going to help me?

827
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,499
Yeah.

828
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,539
Justin...

829
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,859
Stay.

830
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,779
Just gonna go get us some chow.

831
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:42,780
I see an all-nighter ahead.

832
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,259
You're in love with someone back
at school, aren't you?

833
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,779
What?

834
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,699
Hell, no.

835
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,419
Sounds serious.

836
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,019
Danny - I'm not in love.

837
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,779
It's impossible, OK?!

838
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,780
I'm just asking.

839
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,179
I don't know, man.

840
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,459
I've been trying to forget about
things all weekend.

841
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,179
Then Susannah doesn't show up.

842
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,619
What are you talking about?

843
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,499
There's no future in it, Danny.

844
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,419
It can't work!

845
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,979
I'm very confused.

846
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,699
I wouldn't be happy.

847
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,859
I couldn't be happy.

848
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,899
I want to get married!

849
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,819
Have kids and all.

850
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,259
You know?

851
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,260
Uh, huh.

852
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,979
Maybe I should check on Cesar...

853
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:53,980
Make sure he hasn't gone off
the deep end.

854
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:00,180
(phone ringing)

855
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,699
Hello?

856
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,979
Hi, Kevin,

857
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,179
Cesar.

858
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,739
It's really great to hear your voice.

859
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,259
Me, too.

860
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,499
Sorry about being angry the
last time we spoke.

861
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,779
No, it's OK.

862
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,739
I didn't even ask you how you did
in the storm,.

863
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,779
We're all safe and sound. Thanks.

864
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,019
Are you all right?

865
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,979
It's been...

866
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,019
Kevin, it's been a totally crazy week.

867
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,899
A totally crazy weekend.

868
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:37,900
You're telling me.

869
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:43,140
I don't think we should see each
other when you get back.

870
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,379
OK.

871
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,380
What I'm trying to say is...

872
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,419
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

873
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:01,420
I understand.

874
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,260
Kevin?

875
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,979
Are you there?

876
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,419
Yeah.

877
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:23,499
I better go.

878
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:28,500
We're still friends, right?

879
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,860
When I get back, there's this really
cool burger place I can take you to.

880
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,179
I wish you only good things, Kevin.

881
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,699
Cesar...

882
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,819
I'll leave money for the
long-distance bill.

883
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:48,419
The what?

884
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:52,779
Bye, Kevin.

885
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:57,780
(phone hanging up)

886
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,420
Bye.

887
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:20,660
Hey, man!

888
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,459
How'd it go with Brenda?

889
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,619
She's fine.

890
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,699
She left.

891
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,379
Had to get back to her daddy.

892
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,899
Again.

893
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,899
What's up with you, man?

894
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:45,859
Does it have anything to do
with that necklace?

895
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,699
No! It's got absolutely nothing to do
with that goddamn necklace.

896
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:53,659
Nothing!

897
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:57,019
Things have a way of working
themselves out, man.

898
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,939
They always do.

899
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,259
Yeah.

900
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,659
You have got to put in a good word
for Marsha, dude.

901
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,539
I'll tell her you have a
beautiful penis.

902
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,979
Well, as you now know, I don't get
no complaints in that department.

903
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,619
Listen to him.

904
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,499
You missed a once-in-a-lifetime
chance there, cowboy.

905
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,339
Cowboy?

906
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:26,340
I'm not your cowboy.

907
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,299
Aggressive,

908
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,979
I like it.

909
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,179
Let me put some Dixie on for us.

910
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,779
Screw Dixie,

911
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,819
Yes, sir.

912
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:41,419
Drain my pipe, sir

913
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:44,139
What the fuck?!!

914
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:47,539
Jesus, Kevin!
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

915
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,139
- I lost it.
- Fuck!

916
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,179
I'm drunk.

917
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,619
I ain't... I ain't that way, Kevin.

918
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:00,299
Neither am I.

919
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,739
Fuck off! I know what you're
accusing me of.

920
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:06,419
Relay, dude. I ain't accusin'
you of nothin'.

921
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,819
Look, you and me - we're the same.

922
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:14,820
No, bud - we're not.

923
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,219
You started all of this! It was you!

924
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,819
You got a burr in your saddle
about something.

925
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:22,939
Listen.

926
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,139
You and I...

927
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,339
We're friends.

928
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:30,579
We will always be friends.

929
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,580
But...

930
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:45,460
Night.

931
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,739
Everything all right?

932
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,739
Everything's great.

933
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:16,740
Just great.

934
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,699
Hey, studious one.

935
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,259
Hey!

936
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:29,260
What's going on?

937
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,739
What is wrong with this picture?

938
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:41,419
I haven't properly introduced you
to my new friend, Justin.

939
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,459
Nice seeing you again, Marsha.

940
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:49,460
Just so you know, I graduated in the
top 90 percent of my class.

941
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:54,099
That high?

942
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,539
I knew you'd be impressed.

943
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,899
Danny!

944
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,900
Let's go!

945
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,619
Maybe we can come up for the SMU game.

946
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:17,620
That would be cool.

947
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,979
Don't let him drink and drive, Daniel.

948
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,619
I won't.

949
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:42,659
Take your time getting back, too.
The roads are still a mess.

950
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,499
I hope...

951
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,659
Everything works out for you
back at school.

952
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:53,660
Thanks.

953
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,899
For the first time in my life...

954
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,779
The truth was staring me
right in the face.

955
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,459
I'm...

956
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:30,460
Delusional.

957
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,179
Hi.

958
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:11,939
Hi.

959
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,979
This suitcase is really heavy.

960
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,379
I could really use some help
Taking it back to my room.

961
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:23,380
There's a dolly out in the hallway.

962
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,619
Yeah.

963
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,179
Thanks.

964
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,779
I'm sorry...

965
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,419
For what I did.

966
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,219
The last thing I wanted to do
was hurt you.

967
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:41,339
OK.

968
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:46,340
But I need my ring back, Kevin.

969
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:52,300
Yeah.

970
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:32,140
See you.

971
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:38,180
You too.

972
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:44,659
Cesar...

973
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:49,660
You were right all along.

974
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:56,180
I'm a mess.

975
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,099
Wait a second...

976
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,739
I never said you were a mess.

977
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,819
A delusional closet whore, maybe.

978
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,779
But never a mess.

979
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:44,139
Thanks for clarifying that.

980
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:49,140
Just wanted to set the record straight.

981
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,819
At least there's one thing
I'm not confused about.

982
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:01,820
And what's that?

983
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:08,099
You're special to me.

984
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,100
And even though I tried everything
Yo forget that...

985
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:18,740
I couldn't.

986
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:27,019
What am I going to do with you?

987
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,779
You're a smart guy...

988
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:33,179
You'll figure something out.

989
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,819
I just want to know if we're...

990
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:40,820
Possible.

991
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:51,660
I wish I could tell you I'm not
fucked up anymore...

992
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:56,980
That I've got it all figured out.

993
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,739
But - it's Morning in America.

994
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:06,740
And I'm having myself one lucky day.
