1
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,000
Charles, isn't this great?

2
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
Yeah.

3
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,720
Good afternoon.

4
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,960
MECHANIC: Hi.

5
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,480
Man, what wouldn't I do
to get my hands on her?

6
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,560
Get your hands on who?

7
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,840
The Challenger-
$20-million airplane.

8
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,320
What did you think I meant?

9
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,000
- Come along, Charles.
- Charles, you coming?

10
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,760
- Yeah.
- I'm supposed to give you this.

11
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,880
- OK.
- Charles Morse the billionaire?

12
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
My God, is thatwho you are?

13
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,640
Yeah.

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,240
MAN: Stuff everything
into the back.

15
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,600
I've taken the liberty
of talking to the pilot.

16
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,320
I've checked the engine log.
The plane's in good shape.

17
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,600
Good avionics.
The fella's been around.

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,520
Try not to fly
under any low ceiling,

19
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,520
any possibility
of bird-strike, or ice.

20
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,360
- What's bird-strike?
- Flocks of migrating birds.

21
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,280
- Lf we hit them, we're all dead.
- Absolutely.

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,640
Especially this time of year.

23
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,520
Any questions, I'll have a
chopper here and fly you out.

24
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,600
We'll be fine.

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,720
- I said you'd have a good time.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,240
When will you require
your plane?

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,440
- Bob?
- They want the film in 34 hours.

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,800
I'd say 8:00 tomorrow night.

29
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,520
- Eight o'clock tomorrow night.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,760
Thank you.

31
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,520
- Oh, no!

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,320
You can't handle
this northern weather?

33
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,360
- I'll be all right.
- It's your own fault.

34
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,920
WOMAN: Hey, is that a new watch?

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,560
Yeah. Dual time zone.
Tells the time in two places.

36
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,080
What for?

37
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,480
If I want to know
the time in New York,

38
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,960
I don't have to add three.

39
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,920
CHARLES: Look there.

40
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,640
Right there.

41
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
So you built this place
with your own hands?

42
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,640
Yes, ma'am.
Been building it all my life.

43
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
OK, right this way, folks.

44
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,760
You don't have to worry about
keys 'cause we got no locks.

45
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Kitchen is always open.
You can fix whatever you like.

46
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,760
The bedrooms and outhouses
are upstairs.

47
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,800
We want you to relax,
kick off your shoes,

48
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,080
and just get
down-home comfortable.

49
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,480
- Hey, Stephen.
- Yeah?

50
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,920
This is what I'm talking about.

51
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,400
See? That's what I want
for tomorrow:

52
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,840
An unsentimental photograph.

53
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,040
To get a truly
unselfconscious photograph,

54
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,920
you almost have to go
back to the 19th century.

55
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,120
How old is that?

56
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,800
Took it last fall. That's
Jack Hawk, a friend of mine.

57
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
You took the photo?

58
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,040
I took the photo.
He took the bear.

59
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,200
I'd be out hunting with him
right now if you weren't here...

60
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,480
and I had my rifle sighted in.

61
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,240
You interested in books?

62
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,360
Yeah. Why can't you get
your rifle sighted in?

63
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
What?

64
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,080
Why can't you get
your rifle sighted in?

65
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,880
Need to rig up a bench rest.

66
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,160
CHARLES: An ironing board
makes a good bench rest.

67
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,640
No disrespect... I'm surprised
you know what a bench rest is.

68
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,320
Charles knows
what everything is.

69
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,560
Got a question, ask him.
Charles knows everything.

70
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Take a mighty accomplished man
to claim that.

71
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,640
I don't claim anything.

72
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,560
WOMAN: Ask him.
See if I'm wrong.

73
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,960
- Bet you can't stump him.
- Bet you I can.

74
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,200
Tell you what...

75
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
I will give you $5. 00...

76
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,680
if you can tell me what's
on the other side of this blade.

77
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,640
It's a rabbit smoking a pipe.

78
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,840
Hmm.

79
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,080
A rabbit smoking a pipe.
Well, well, well.

80
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,640
Why in the world would that be?

81
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,440
Uh, it's a symbol
of the Cree Indians.

82
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,840
On one side there's the panther,

83
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,840
on the other, his prey,
the rabbit.

84
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,000
He sits unafraid.
He smokes his pipe.

85
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,040
It's a traditional motif.

86
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,920
Why is he unafraid?

87
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,320
Because he's smarter
than the panther.

88
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,240
Ha! Sir... you impress me.

89
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,680
Oh. Thank you.

90
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,640
Amazing accomplishment.

91
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,840
No, it's not an accomplishment.
It's a freak.

92
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,160
Is that so?

93
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

94
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,880
I seem to retain
all these facts,

95
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,840
but putting them to any useful
purpose is another matter.

96
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,000
MAN: Hmm.

97
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,800
Oh, hey, listen up, folks.

98
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,640
We got a problem
with bears around here.

99
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,280
Never leave food uncovered,
even in the lodge.

100
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Never.

101
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,320
You see a bear near you,
stand still.

102
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Let him know that you know
that he sees you.

103
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,920
And back up, hmm? Real slow.

104
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Anybody's in trouble,
get my attention.

105
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,440
I'll be on it
like a duck on a June bug.

106
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,920
Now, make yourselves
comfortable.

107
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
I think I'm going to bed.

108
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,560
Shut up!

109
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,960
Lord, I'm bushed.

110
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,640
New book?

111
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,880
Yes. It's about surviving
in the wilderness.

112
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,480
You're always reading something.

113
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,320
Yeah. My secretary gave it
to me. Do you know why?

114
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
Huh?

115
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,400
You know why
she gave me the book?

116
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,640
That guy gave me the creeps with
all that talk about the bear.

117
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,440
Why she gave you the book?

118
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,120
Because you're
the salt of the earth.

119
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,040
Oh, is that so?

120
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,280
You're the most excellent man.
That's why I married you.

121
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,280
And you're the only woman
I've ever wanted.

122
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Well, then...
see what a luck y guy you are?

123
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,400
Yes, I do.

124
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,480
CHARLES: This is
a special day for me.

125
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,200
I know it is. I'm really glad
you came away with us.

126
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,640
You should get away more often.

127
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
Charles.

128
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,600
Yeah?

129
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,680
Can you go downstairs
and get me a sandwich?

130
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
Yeah, OK. Of course.

131
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,080
Did I ever tell you
you're an angel?

132
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
No.

133
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,280
Everything but the wings.

134
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,640
A sandwich.

135
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,440
Aah!

136
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,080
Surprise!

137
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,960
Oh, my God.
Charles, are you all right?

138
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,200
Christ, Charles.
Are you all right?

139
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,520
Jesus, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

140
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,800
Are you all right?

141
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
- I'm fine.
- Are you all right?

142
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,320
- Uh-huh.
- You sure?

143
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,600
EVERYONE SINGING:
Happy birthday dear Charles

144
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,880
Happy birthday.

145
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,640
So you didn't forget.

146
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,360
I could never forget you.

147
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,280
I could never forget.
Come here, baby.

148
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,960
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir.
- A glass of champagne.

149
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Champagne for Charles!

150
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,720
Thank you. Thank you.

151
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,680
Blow out the candle, Charles.

152
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,560
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

153
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,920
Can I get serious for a moment?

154
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,640
Charles, thank you
for your good nature,

155
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,560
your intelligence,
your generosity.

156
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,960
Yeah.

157
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,760
Uh, forgive usfor this charade.

158
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,240
And in short, happy birthday.

159
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,840
ALL: Happy birthday, Charles.
CHARLES: Thank you.

160
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,680
To a good companion,
a goodfriend, and a good sport.

161
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
And a very brave man.

162
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,440
MAN: Hear, hear!

163
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Here.

164
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,720
Thank you. Ah.

165
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,000
Right.

166
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,520
Oh, Mickey, that's beautiful.

167
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,880
There's an engraving inside.

168
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,280
What's it say, Charles?

169
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,320
It says, "To my beloved husband
on his birthday...

170
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,200
'from the luckiest woman
in the world."

171
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,280
ALL: Ohh...

172
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
This is a superb present.
Thank you.

173
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,520
MICKEY: May you wear it
in good health.

174
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,520
Here you go.
Here you go, you birthday boy.

175
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,400
Thank you.

176
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,400
MAN: Ooh...
SECOND MAN: What is it?

177
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,920
- Oh, look at that!
- Good knife.

178
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,040
CHARLES: It's beautiful.

179
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,840
Give him a coin. You got
to give the donor a coin.

180
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,760
Old superstition.

181
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,560
Ah, yes. Thank you.

182
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,240
STEPHEN: Give him a coin?

183
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,680
If someone gives you a knife,

184
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,960
you should give them
a coin in return...

185
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,280
or it cuts the friendship.

186
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
Thank you, Bob.

187
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
Charles.

188
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,160
Getting late. Work day tomorrow.
Let's pack it in.

189
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,880
- Happy birthday, Charles.
- Happy birthday.

190
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,240
Thanks. Thank you. Good night.

191
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,680
STEPHEN: Come on.
WOMAN: Happy birthday.

192
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,880
Thank you.

193
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,200
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

194
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Nice looking lady. Your wife?

195
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Yes. Why do you ask?

196
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,320
Just like to know
who everybody is.

197
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,240
STEPHEN: Hold on.
It's flaring. Got it.

198
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,320
- OK... and let's go.
- Five, six.

199
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
All righty.

200
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,080
Beautiful.
Really beautiful. Great.

201
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,440
- Yep.
- Yeah, that's great.

202
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,080
- Oops.
- Could you lift that up?

203
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,200
- Are we on here?
- Give me the 180.

204
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
- For me?
- No, no, no.

205
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
ROBERT: One more. Let's go.

206
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,080
We'll do one more roll.
One more roll.

207
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,040
Officer... can I sunbathe
on this beach nude?

208
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,520
Sorry, lady,
it's against the rules.

209
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,000
But I have a divine right.

210
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,000
ROBERT: Your left ain't bad,
either, but rules is rules.

211
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,440
Let's go. Check it, please.

212
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,840
ROBERT: Beautiful.
MAN: Huh. Kodiak bear.

213
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,600
Soon kill you as look atyou.

214
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,120
And the one's killed a man,

215
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,560
man-hunter for the rest
of his life.

216
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,680
Nothing he'd rather eat.
Got the taste of human flesh.

217
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
A man-killing machine.

218
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,760
ROBERT: I'm leaving today,
so let's getthe shoes polished.

219
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,160
Do I need to walk you
through this whole thing?

220
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
- No, the shoes-
- Scrapthe shoes.

221
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,160
Whatthe-for God's sakes,
this isn't brain surgery.

222
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,880
It's afucking pair of shoes.
GetJames down here.

223
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,040
Robert, he's sick.

224
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,840
He's sick,
the shoes look like shit,

225
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,360
and everything I ask youfor-

226
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,560
This is lame.
This is reallyfucking lame.

227
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,760
The inside of a banana peel
will shine shoes.

228
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,960
Come with me.
Afount of information.

229
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,120
Shine shoes with a banana.
You should know that.

230
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
He's sick, Bob. James is sick.

231
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,520
Well, how sick is he?

232
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,320
He'd have to get betterto die.

233
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,480
Ha!

234
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,240
That guy.

235
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,440
That guy. He's the guy
for my photograph.

236
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,240
Excuse me. Where is this guy?
He's yourfriend, right?

237
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
Where is this guy in the photo?

238
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,360
This is the guy we want,
not somefucking model.

239
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,360
Where-where is he?

240
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,760
Jack Hawk?
Cabin up north, 80 miles.

241
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,640
ROBERT: Does he have a phone?

242
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,920
MAN: No phone, no radio.
He'll likely be out hunting.

243
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,640
ROBERT: Well, then we'll just
go andfind him. Let's go.

244
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,240
Seems you can make a compass
out of a needle.

245
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,600
My God. That's a new one on me.

246
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,880
You spend much time
in the woods?

247
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,760
No, I'm afraid most of
my knowledge is theoretical.

248
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,400
Such a... perfect spot.

249
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,160
Such privilege.

250
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,520
It's a shame...
everyone can't enjoy it.

251
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,880
Yeah.

252
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,360
It is remote, and-

253
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,520
That's true. Now, you think
this spot is so remote...

254
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,200
that only thefew can enjoy it,
but I got a plan.

255
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,080
I got a scheme
to developthis lake,

256
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,760
and I thinkthat
you could appreciate it.

257
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,680
Now, no need, really,
foryou to look atthese...

258
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,080
'cause you can envision this
betterthan they can draw,

259
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,640
but I wantyou to look
atthesefigures.

260
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,560
Now, here's
the interesting part.

261
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,600
For only 30 or
40 million dollars, you can-

262
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,600
Ah.

263
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,600
I beg your pardon?

264
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,200
I thoughtfor a moment
you were just being courteous.

265
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,560
What do you mean?

266
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
Nothing.

267
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,280
Come on, let's go get him.
We'll lose the light.

268
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,360
We lose the light at4:18.

269
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
There's the guy we should've
been shooting all along.

270
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
He's got some character
in hisface.

271
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,800
- Charles.
- Yeah?

272
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,080
- What's the matter?
- Huh?

273
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,480
Uh... no, it's nothing.

274
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,480
He's jaded. That's what it is.

275
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,720
That's it. I'm jaded.

276
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,920
We're going on an impromptu
adventure. You come, too.

277
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,640
MICKEY: Charles on an adventure?

278
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,600
That's right.
What do you say, Charles?

279
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,200
We'll be back in two hours.

280
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,760
- Uh...
- Get some air underyourwings.

281
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
All right.

282
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,680
Yeah, OK.

283
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,720
Behold the mighty hunter.
Come on.

284
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,640
Hello!

285
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
Aw, that's just great.

286
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,320
Our model's gone bear hunting.
How butch of him.

287
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,760
Where's he going?

288
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,640
Big Bass Lake, partner!

289
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,280
It's about 20 miles northwest.

290
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,120
And we're left here taking
a picture of sweet Fanny Anne.

291
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,000
- What do you say, Charles?
- Huh?

292
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,600
ROBERT: We, uh...

293
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,080
- Should we chance it?
- Be careful.

294
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,480
ROBERT: Careful of what?

295
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,960
CHARLES: It's a deadfall.

296
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,680
- What's a deadfall?
- It's a pitto catch bears.

297
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,120
What are we being careful of?

298
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,400
It's a bear pit.

299
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,680
What do you say? Should we
press on? Should we be bold?

300
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,200
You really need tofind him?

301
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,680
I need to getthatfilm.

302
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,680
A good plan today is better
than a perfect plan tomorrow.

303
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,120
- What do you say?
- OK, let's be bold.

304
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,880
Hey, there's the spirit
that beatthe Japanese.

305
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,480
Weather coming infrom
the north. Snow, maybe.

306
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,720
- Could I tell you something?
- Hmm? Yeah, if you like.

307
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,240
I admire the way you took
thatjoke last night.

308
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,680
Handled itwell.
Embarrassing moment.

309
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,640
- I thoughtyou handled itwell.
- Thank you.

310
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,880
Tough row to hoe,
you think about it.

311
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,240
Whatwould that be?

312
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,720
Oh, all that money.

313
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,840
Ah.

314
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
A lot of responsibility.

315
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,080
Never knowing
who yourfriends are,

316
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,000
never knowing
what people value youfor.

317
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Yeah.

318
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,240
Must be tough.

319
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,600
Neverfeel sorryfor
a man who owns a plane.

320
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,680
So... what do you
value mefor, Bob?

321
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,800
Well, I tell you what...
I like your style.

322
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,800
And I think yourwife's
pretty cute, too.

323
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Yes.

324
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,880
So... how are you planning
to kill me?

325
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,120
- Oh, fuck! Hold on!
- Oh, shit!

326
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,400
- What's happening?!
- Oh, no! Jesus!

327
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,760
Aah!

328
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
- God damn it!
- Look out!

329
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,560
Jesus!

330
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,000
Aah! Aah...

331
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,880
Bob!

332
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,480
OK, get him up. Get him up.

333
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,280
I got him.

334
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,320
Steve. Steve!

335
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,080
Anyone got any matches?

336
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,280
Got any matches?

337
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,400
Help me up.

338
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,280
We'll make afire right here.
Make afire.

339
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,400
That's better. Yeah.

340
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,960
Come on. Oh, God.

341
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,920
CHARLES: Come on.

342
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,560
Come on. Come on.

343
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,320
That's it. Come on. Oh, God.

344
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,440
Oh, shit.

345
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,520
STEPHEN: I'm cold.

346
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,960
Let's stopfucking about,
shall we, and getthe guy warm.

347
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,160
Hey, come on. We need those.
We need them.

348
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,240
Come on, Stephen, come on.
Come here.

349
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
ROBERT: I letthefire burn out.

350
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,160
CHARLES: We've only got
afewflares left.

351
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,720
Shouldn'twe keepthem
for signaling?

352
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,440
Whatwe need is...

353
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,520
Whatwe want is wood-quite
a bit of it, for a signalfire.

354
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,880
When they comefor us,
they'll see the smoke.

355
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,000
Huh?

356
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,440
- Why would they comefor us?
- Hmm?

357
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,280
Well, they know
we wentto the cabin.

358
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,160
When they go there,
they'll see the note.

359
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,080
Oh.

360
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,240
ROBERT: I'm afraid
we're infor a walk.

361
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,680
What's that mean,
'we're infor a walk"?

362
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,240
Whatthefuck does that mean?

363
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,480
I once read an interesting book.

364
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,000
It said that most people
lost in the wilds, they...

365
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,240
CHARLES: They die of shame.
STEPHEN: What?

366
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah.

367
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,240
They die of shame.
'What did I do wrong?"

368
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,160
'How could I have gotten
myself into this?"

369
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,320
And so they sitthere,
and they... die.

370
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,880
They didn't do the one thing
thatwould've saved their lives.

371
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,360
And what is that, Charles?

372
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,000
Thinking.

373
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,320
Look. Steve, look.

374
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,160
All right, here's the lodge.

375
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,960
Here's the cabin where
we were supposed to have gone.

376
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,560
This is where we did go-

377
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,440
through this pass,
mountains, river.

378
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,360
They'll be lookingfor us
in the south, all right?

379
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,640
If we can get back south
of this pass by tonight,

380
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,840
we can use theflares.

381
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,760
How do wefind it in the woods?

382
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,200
Head south.

383
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,320
Aha. We head south. How do
we know which way is south?

384
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,000
OK, uh...

385
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Look.

386
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,680
Pointthe hour hand atthe sun.

387
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,520
Halfway between the hour hand
and 12:00 is south.

388
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,160
This is broken.
Give me yourwatch.

389
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,880
Mine's busted, too.

390
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,560
- Steve?
- It's lost.

391
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,000
OK. All right, I'll tell you.

392
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,440
Uh... the birds will beflying
south. We'llfollow them.

393
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,320
- What if we can't see them?
- Sorry I got us into this!

394
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,720
Stopthat! Stop it!

395
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,480
Just stop it.

396
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,640
- Where are you going?
- Gonna make a compass.

397
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,840
Uh...

398
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,480
Right. You take a needle,
rub it on silk, magnetize it.

399
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
And, uh...

400
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,480
Here, place it on a leaf. Here.

401
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,480
You have a compass.

402
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,160
Who travels with a needle?

403
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,320
Ah.

404
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,360
Here.

405
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,840
Ha ha! Oh, shit.

406
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,880
You see? Ltworks.

407
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,080
Itworks.

408
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,760
That peak is south.

409
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,960
- What if it isn't?
- Huh?

410
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,600
It is. Has no choice. It's drawn
by the Earth's magnetism.

411
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,440
I know how itworks, Charles.

412
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,920
Good. Then you know.
That's south.

413
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,560
What do we do when we getthere?

414
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,880
Take another sighting.

415
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,480
It doesn'tfeel south, Charles.

416
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,720
Just because you're lost doesn't
mean your compass is broken.

417
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,320
Come on.

418
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,360
The Vikings would steer
their shipwith a rope.

419
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,240
A rope?
How'd they do that, Charles?

420
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,800
They'd have these two set points
on the land...

421
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,400
they'd left behind
or sailed awayfrom,

422
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,560
and they'd line them up,
and thatwould be their bearing.

423
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,000
Then they'd trail this long rope
behind the ship,

424
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,200
pointing it atthose two
points-the hill orwhatever.

425
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,080
You mightwantto conserve
your breath.

426
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,760
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

427
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,600
Gotto getthrough by nightfall.

428
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,080
Come on.

429
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,200
What are the odds
thatthey'll see us,

430
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,720
thatthey'll see theflares?

431
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
ROBERT: Damnfine.

432
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,120
You think so?

433
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,840
I don't know,
but I have to say so, don't I?

434
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,440
ROBERT: City boy.

435
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,600
- Charles.
- Yeah?

436
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,000
Is it my diseased imagination,
or did you say,

437
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,800
'How are you planning
to kill me?"

438
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,280
- Did you say that?
- Yeah.

439
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,280
What did that mean? Why would
I wantto kill you, Charles?

440
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,800
For my wife.

441
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,880
- For Mickey?
- Yeah.

442
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
That's a bizarre way
to meet girls.

443
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,280
I'd kill you to get
nextto yourwife?

444
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,800
I've seen you with her.

445
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,280
Charles, baby...

446
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,640
ROBERT: We worktogether.

447
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,200
CHARLES: No.
I've seen the way you are.

448
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,080
No offense, Charles,
but I can get my own girl,

449
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,240
if you've noticed
since we've known each other.

450
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,000
And P. S., you're a powerful guy.

451
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,840
Why would I want
to antagonize you, Charles?

452
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,720
Forthe money.

453
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,920
Oh.

454
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,120
The money.

455
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,240
Now it's the broad, now it's
the boodle. Nothing is safe.

456
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,240
Rich man. All anybody wants is
to take somethingfrom you,

457
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,000
and when they want it
bad enough, to kill you.

458
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,720
You know something, Charles?
The rich are different.

459
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,640
STEPHEN:
Howfar do you think it is?

460
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,640
Can't be more
than about 10 miles.

461
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,760
- Aah!
- What?

462
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,880
A stitch. A stitch in my side.

463
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,960
- Find a round stone.
- What?

464
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Find a round stone.
Spit under it.

465
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,280
Old Indian remedy?

466
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,600
Yeah, that's right.

467
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,840
You think I'm afool.

468
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,720
No. Old Indian remedy.
Makes sense.

469
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,440
Make him slow down,
find a round stone,

470
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,120
take his mind off it,
make him stretch, bend over.

471
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,560
You think I'm afool
because of what I said.

472
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,280
- Aboutwhat?
- About my wife.

473
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,960
Ah, whatyou said
aboutyourwife.

474
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,120
What I think... I thinkthat
you gottoo much money,

475
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,640
uh... latent homosexuality,
lots of other good stuff,

476
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,720
paranoia...

477
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,360
We'll all gettogether
when we get back,

478
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,440
you and me and yourwife,
and we'll get into a hottub...

479
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,880
and, um... bare ourfeelings,
and, um...

480
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,840
Look, even if I wanted to kill
you, I need you to get home,

481
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,320
youfucking idiot.

482
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,760
Needing people.
Isn't it a bitch?

483
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,000
- Who are we talking about?
- Fannie Farmer.

484
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,240
The mother of
level measurement here.

485
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,120
- Good to know you have a hero.
- Oh, cheering up, are we?

486
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,520
Regaining our impertinent,
feisty demeanor, eh?

487
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,960
It's good of you to notice.

488
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,080
- Knows all, tells all.

489
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,200
Wait.

490
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,640
Listen, listen.

491
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,160
Come on.

492
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,880
Come on!

493
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,880
Charles, come on!

494
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,280
We'll never make it.
Now, then...

495
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,520
This tree. Come on! Hurry. Pull!

496
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,680
Steve, now! Pull! Help me!

497
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,840
Come on.

498
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,800
One, two, three!

499
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Up!

500
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,880
Up!

501
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,600
OK.

502
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,520
STEPHEN: Come on!

503
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,400
STEPHEN: Easy!

504
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,960
STEPHEN: Keep coming!

505
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,000
STEPHEN: Charles, go!

506
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,800
- Yes!
- Take it easy, Charles.

507
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,040
Look out! Look out. Come on.

508
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,880
- Charles, it's OK.
- You got it. Come on!

509
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,040
- Just keep coming!
- Come on, Charles!

510
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
STEPHEN:
Just keep coming, Charles.

511
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,720
STEPHEN: Keep coming!
CHARLES: Aah...

512
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,400
STEPHEN: Charles!

513
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,600
STEPHEN: Charles! Shit!
ROBERT: Hang on!

514
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,960
ROBERT: Oh-Jesus!

515
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,640
STEPHEN:
Charles, hang on! Hang on!

516
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,080
Charles! Char-

517
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Hold on!

518
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,040
Aah...

519
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,960
ROBERT: Charles, hang on!
CHARLES: Aah!

520
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,440
- You OK?
- Yeah.

521
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,120
Let's go.

522
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,160
CHARLES: Oh, God.

523
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,440
CHARLES: I losttheflares.

524
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,680
ROBERT: We'll get by.
CHARLES: How?

525
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,000
ROBERT: I've got, uh...
six matches left.

526
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,280
ROBERT: A signalfire.
CHARLES: No.

527
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,920
ROBERT: We'll make a signal
fire. The plane will see us.

528
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,440
Charles?
Snap out of it, Charles.

529
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,240
It's gonna befine, Charles.
It's gonna befine.

530
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,680
Which way is it, Charles?

531
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,160
It's upthere.

532
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,280
Man, come on.

533
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Oh, God. Aah.

534
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,600
- You OK?
- Yeah.

535
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,800
OK.

536
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,000
You saved me.

537
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,040
Get over it.
I need you to navigate.

538
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,080
You saved me.

539
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,840
I couldn't kill you
with Stephen around.

540
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,200
I'd have to kill him, too.

541
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,080
Come on. You saved my life.

542
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,960
Buy me something nice
when we get home.

543
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,760
How do you like your coffee?

544
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,040
I like my coffee
like I like my women.

545
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,120
Bitter and murk y.

546
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,800
CHARLES:
I lostthe bloodyflares.

547
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,360
ROBERT: Hey, rememberyou told
me why people die in the woods?

548
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,880
CHARLES:
Yeah, they die of shame.

549
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,440
ROBERT: Take a lessonfrom it.

550
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,520
We wantto get up-top of
that rise, high as possible-

551
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,000
letthe plane see thefire.

552
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,560
Why would they even
come lookingfor us?

553
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,400
Know what happens
when you misplace a billionaire?

554
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,600
Gonna make some story
when we get back home.

555
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,120
Yes. Quite a changefrom, "That
cab driverwas so rude to me."

556
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,560
ROBERT: See anything?

557
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,080
No.

558
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,920
CHARLES: Let's go.

559
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,760
Oh, my God.

560
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,160
STEPHEN: Oh, shit.

561
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,120
CHARLES: OK, let's see.

562
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,640
Hey, maybe the buckle
threw it off.

563
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,080
- What are we gonna do?
- Well...

564
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,320
What are we going to do, OK?
We're going to die out here!

565
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,680
Nobody knows where we are,

566
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,920
and we don't know
whatthe hell we're doing here!

567
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,360
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

568
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,200
Nobody knows where we are.
We got nothing to eat!

569
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,440
All right, Steve. Look.

570
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,360
Look here.
This is whatwe're gonna do.

571
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,960
You see this?
Gonna make a spear, all right?

572
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,880
You... you want me to make
afucking spear?

573
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,680
Yeah. We need you
to make oneforfishing.

574
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,480
Go on, take that. Take it.

575
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,640
Good. Fine. OK, you can do that.

576
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,240
They'll neverfind us.

577
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,800
They will. And even if they
don't, we'll walk out of here.

578
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,120
Do as I say.

579
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,320
I'm gonna make afire.
Come on! Get on with it.

580
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,000
It'll be OK.

581
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,400
What is he gonna do,
make a spear?

582
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,200
Is he gonnafishfor our dinner?

583
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,920
I wanted to give him
something to do, that's all.

584
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,480
Are they gonna comefor us?
You are an important guy, right?

585
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,520
Right?

586
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,080
Look, I'm talking to you!

587
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,240
Whatwould you like to do, huh?
Should we lay down and die?

588
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,240
Should we lie down and die?!

589
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,400
There's nobody here but us.

590
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,520
Have I missed something?

591
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,360
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

592
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,360
OK.

593
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,400
STEPHEN: God!

594
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Shit!

595
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,120
Shit.

596
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,360
CHARLES: Take your hands away.
STEPHEN: Aah...

597
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,960
STEPHEN: Oh! Oh, it's...
CHARLES: Take your hands away.

598
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,560
Shit! What have I done?
What have I done?

599
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,880
STEPHEN: Oh, shit...

600
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,920
Jesus.

601
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,200
It's deep.

602
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,960
I'm not gonna lose my leg!

603
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,240
Lt'll be all right.

604
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,720
STEPHEN: Oh...

605
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,120
- Press down, both hands.
- OK.

606
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,640
- Keepthem there.
- OK.

607
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,280
All right? OK.

608
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,880
OK.

609
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,240
CHARLES: I'm gonna
pull this tight, OK?

610
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,680
Wait! All right.

611
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,280
CHARLES: OK.

612
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,680
Bury this.

613
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,880
CHARLES:
Start building thefire.

614
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,480
- You'll be all right.

615
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,720
CHARLES: Is that all right?
Nottoo tight?

616
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,440
STEPHEN: No, it's great.
CHARLES: Good.

617
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,160
CHARLES: Well, it's a clean cut.
It bled clean.

618
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,400
CHARLES: If we change
the bandages regularly,

619
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,120
it should knit upfine.

620
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,160
Guess I'm no lumberjack.

621
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,280
Ah...

622
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,880
You're doingfine, Steve. Fine.

623
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,520
- You know something?
- What?

624
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,120
You're all right.

625
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,840
Am I?

626
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,120
No, I mean it.
Very thoughtful man.

627
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,760
- Thank you.
- And I appreciate it.

628
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,560
It's my pleasure.

629
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,960
STEPHEN:
Are we getting out of here?

630
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,720
CHARLES: Yes, we are.
STEPHEN: How are we getting out?

631
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,880
CHARLES: Uh...

632
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,920
OK, you see this...

633
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,520
See that constellation?

634
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,960
Cassiopeia-the big W.

635
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,120
OK... try the right edge
of the W.

636
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,160
Points to the North Star.
The North Star is north.

637
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,240
Tomorrow, we walk south
to the river.

638
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,880
The riverwill take us home.

639
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,720
Will itwork better
than that compass?

640
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,520
- Yeah.

641
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,680
I hope so.

642
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,160
Why do people die in the woods?

643
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,920
They die of shame.

644
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,640
Yeah.

645
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,920
Puts things in perspective,
doesn't it?

646
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,680
What's that?

647
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,880
Out here. A little different
from thefashion world.

648
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,880
Differentfrom snorting coke
off the girls' hipbones.

649
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,760
In whatway?

650
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,000
Charles, you know,
you're starting to loosen up.

651
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,280
You think so?

652
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,600
That's my report.

653
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,040
- Huh?
- So?

654
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,280
What?

655
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,440
He's notthat badly hurt.

656
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,640
Then what are our chances
when all is said and done?

657
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,800
We can walk out of here
and probably die,

658
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,240
orwe can stay here,
and he'll certainly die.

659
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,680
I think our chances are good.

660
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,040
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

661
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,600
They're betterthan good.

662
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,800
We know thatthat's north,
and that's...

663
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,680
Charles? Charles!

664
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,000
I told you we had to bury those.

665
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,640
ROBERT: What's the difference?
STEPHEN: Hey!

666
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,960
CHARLES: We must getthem down!
ROBERT: Why?

667
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,080
They putthe smell of blood
in the air!

668
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,160
- Hey!

669
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,120
ROBERT: I'm not climbing a tree
in the middle of a thunderstorm!

670
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,040
CHARLES: We have to get it down!
ROBERT: You climbthe tree!

671
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,160
CHARLES: Give me a hand.
I'll getthem down.

672
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,680
STEPHEN: Oh, shit!
CHARLES: What?

673
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,480
Oh, shit! Oh, sh-

674
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,280
Aah! Whoa! Oh, shit! Oh!

675
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,320
ROBERT: Charles, stay back!
CHARLES: Go away!

676
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,560
Aah!

677
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,720
CHARLES: Hyah!
ROBERT: Charles!

678
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,080
Charles, stay back!

679
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,920
CHARLES: Bob!

680
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,520
ROBERT: For God's sake, Charles!

681
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,640
Come on, Charles!

682
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,080
STEPHEN: Stop!

683
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,160
Steve!

684
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,560
Steve!

685
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,880
Oh, God.

686
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,320
Come on! Come on!

687
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,000
We navigate by the stars.

688
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,640
We travel by night
if there's a moon.

689
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,360
We can't live out
the winter here.

690
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,680
The riverwill take us out.

691
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,040
They won't lookfor us
thisfar north?

692
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,360
We have to walk out.

693
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,880
Ah.

694
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,120
What do we eat?

695
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,000
I'm working on it.

696
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,800
Aah ha ha ha ha!

697
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,000
Whoo!

698
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,440
CHARLES: How aboutthat?

699
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,400
Yeah!

700
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,320
Hey, is...

701
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,280
Hang on.

702
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,800
Come on!

703
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,920
Come on!

704
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,240
Wait!

705
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,680
Wait!

706
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,560
No!

707
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,080
No! Wait! Stop!

708
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,480
Oh, God.

709
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,360
Did you know that
you can makefirefrom ice?

710
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,280
You can makefirefrom ice.

711
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,280
Hello! I'm talking to you.

712
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,560
Do you know how that
could be done? Bob?

713
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,880
Can you think?

714
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,760
You... moneyedfolk, isn't it?

715
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,920
- Isn't it?
- Firefrom ice. You know how?

716
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,680
Sit upthere, drinks and golf,
screwing the maid,

717
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,520
but getyou in an emergency...

718
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,000
- Try.
- And you bloom.

719
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,880
You make me sick, you know that?

720
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,040
I'm sure I do.

721
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,560
Youfuckin' make me sick!

722
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,720
I mean, what puts you off?
Jews and taxes!

723
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,560
Firefrom ice.
Can you think how?

724
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,240
I don'twantto know, Charles!

725
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,240
You have anything
you'd like to livefor? Hmm?

726
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,600
You know something?
You know something?

727
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,880
Maybe we were right
to have let people like you...

728
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,360
run this country
all these years.

729
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,320
You're the only ones
dense enough!

730
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,680
I'm not dense,
I just have no imagination.

731
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,360
Making a decision tree,
is that it?

732
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,720
That's it, Bob.

733
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,360
We can'tthinkthey'd come back?

734
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,000
No. You shouldn'tthink
they would come back.

735
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,640
They've scouted this area,
and they'll move on.

736
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,320
All right.

737
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,160
All right.

738
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,120
Firefrom ice.

739
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,720
Let's have it.

740
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,240
Ice, if you take it
into your hands,

741
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,560
can be molded into a lens...

742
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,160
...which will concentrate
sunlight intofire.

743
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,240
Hmm?

744
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,680
I doubtwe'll be reduced to
that. We still have the matches.

745
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,080
I believe that's all we'll need.

746
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,800
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

747
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,000
CHARLES: Well, there's, uh...
there'sfish in there.

748
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,040
Whatwill we usefortackle?
How will we baitthem?

749
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,080
Wouldn'tyoufind that
attractive?

750
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,960
I don't know. I, uh...

751
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,200
It's gold.
The whole world longsfor it.

752
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,840
I'm not in a very humorous mood.

753
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,800
Come on.
Don't go native on me, Bob.

754
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,800
I'm sorry. I'm justtired.
I'm... very tired.

755
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,440
Why don'tyou rest...
and gather some wood?

756
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:43,120
Bob! He's a man-killer-been
following us the whole time.

757
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,400
He's stalking us.

758
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,000
Come on!

759
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,880
He's toying with us.

760
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,120
What are we going to do,
Charles?

761
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,200
Huh?

762
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,080
What, do I have a plan?

763
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,720
Am I supposed to have a plan?
You tell me.

764
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,360
We can't move.
Itwon't let us eat.

765
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,720
Well... we're going
to starve up here.

766
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,880
What are we gonna do?

767
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,440
We're gonna kill him.

768
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,360
CHARLES: We get him to attack.
Spear, bait.

769
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,120
Induce a charge.
Bear charges and rears.

770
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,640
As hefalls,
he impales himself on the spear.

771
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,680
Same principle as the deadfall-
use his own weightto kill him.

772
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,560
What are we gonna use
to bait him?

773
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,040
We lure him.

774
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,600
- What?
- We lure him!

775
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,480
You know... Masai boys in Africa,
11 years old,

776
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,240
they kill lions with spears.

777
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,360
How do we..."lure" him?

778
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,280
Eleven-year-old boys
kill a lion.

779
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,320
Indian boys used to run up
to the bear and slap him-

780
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,480
count coup on him
as a test of manhood.

781
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,720
No, no, Charles.
How are we going to lure him?

782
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,800
Blood.

783
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,120
Blood!

784
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,520
We'll have to distract him,
of course.

785
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,960
We'll have to distract him and
trap him, but it can be done.

786
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,160
Do you believe it, Bob?
You believe it?

787
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,600
- I don't know, Charles.
- Huh?

788
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,600
- I don'tthink it'll work.
- Itwill work!

789
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,640
No.

790
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,560
Itwill work. What one man
can do, another can do.

791
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,400
You can't kill the bear,
Charles. He's...

792
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,760
He's ahead of us all the time,
like he's reading our minds.

793
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,560
He's stalking us,
for God's sakes!

794
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,960
You wantto die out here, huh?

795
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,320
Well, then die.
But I tell you what...

796
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,400
I'm not gonna die. No, sirree.
I'm not gonna die.

797
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,800
No, I'm gonna kill the bear.

798
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,680
Say, "I'm gonna kill the bear."

799
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,920
Say it. "I'm gonna kill the
bear. I'm gonna kill the bear!"

800
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,200
Say it!

801
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,920
- I'm gonna kill the bear.
- Say it again!

802
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,040
- I'm gonna kill the bear.
- And again!

803
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,440
I'm gonna kill the bear!

804
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,760
Good. What one man can do,
another can do.

805
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,360
What one man can do,
another can do.

806
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,320
Say it again!

807
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,800
What one man can do,
another can do!

808
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,760
- And again!
- What one man can do...

809
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,160
another can do!

810
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,880
Yeah! You're goddamn right.

811
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,520
'Cause today... I'm a-gonna
kill the motherfucker.

812
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,760
Come on.

813
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,040
Come on.

814
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,200
- Now.

815
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,040
Run!

816
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,160
Aah! Oof!

817
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,720
Come on.

818
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,000
- Come on!
- All right.

819
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,520
Aah!

820
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,320
Aah!

821
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,000
- Hey!

822
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,920
CHARLES: Come on,
you son of a bitch!

823
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,680
CHARLES: Hey!

824
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,920
Get him in the neck, Charles!

825
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,520
Jesus. Jesus!

826
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,320
Over here! Come on! Come on!

827
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,480
Aah!

828
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,080
Come on, you son of a bitch!

829
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,440
Look out. Look out! Look out!

830
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,640
Come on!

831
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,880
CHARLES: Hey!

832
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,560
- Come on! Charles!
- Aah!

833
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,440
Charles!

834
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,760
Aah! Ohh!

835
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,600
Aah!

836
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,720
- Hyah!

837
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,480
Come and get me!
Get me! Come and get-

838
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,520
Come on!

839
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:04,160
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you son of a bitch!

840
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,480
Aah!

841
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,440
Come here, you motherfucker!
Come and get me!

842
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,520
Charles!

843
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,560
- Come and get me!
- Charles!

844
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,160
Come on! Come on, get me!
Come on, get me!

845
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,880
ROBERT: Look out!

846
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,800
Charles, look out! Charles!

847
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,800
Aah!

848
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,360
- Unh!

849
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,480
Char-

850
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,000
Charles?

851
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,200
Charles?

852
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,400
Wish we had some salt.

853
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,880
You know, you can... you can
season meatwith gunpowder.

854
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,240
Did you know that?

855
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,760
Wish we had some gunpowder.

856
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,920
I don't suppose
you made onefor me?

857
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,280
Yeah.

858
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,720
Hey... ahem.

859
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,720
- What do you think?
- Oh, yeah.

860
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,040
What's the matter, Charles?

861
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,160
Nothing.

862
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,880
No, really. What?

863
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,200
All my life, I wanted to do
something thatwas...

864
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,120
...thatwas unequivocal.

865
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,480
Well, Charlie, I certainly
thinkthis qualifies.

866
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,680
It's something.

867
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,840
See, Charles, that's why
they call it "personal growth."

868
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,720
A month ago,
Smokey would've reared up,

869
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,440
you probably would've
called your lawyer.

870
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,560
Nah. I wouldn't do that
to an animal.

871
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,680
OK?

872
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,640
CHARLES: So I said, uh...

873
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,400
I said, "If this is my life,
then this is my life."

874
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,080
Butyou can change your life.

875
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,480
That's what I'm telling you.

876
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,840
Yeah. Is thattrue?

877
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,920
Well, why wouldn't it be true?

878
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,800
Because I never knew anybody who
did actually change their lives.

879
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,680
I tell you what...

880
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,000
I'm going to start my life over.

881
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,280
ROBERT: Yeah.

882
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,640
You'd be thefirst.

883
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,920
Yeah.

884
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,320
No one's been here
for quite a while.

885
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,280
- What do you make of it?
- Lf we're here...

886
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,600
That canoe's gonna take us
right out.

887
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,200
You know whatwe gotto do?
Find out if that canoefloats.

888
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,320
Yeah.

889
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,400
Hey, itfloats!

890
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,480
Yeah.

891
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,480
Cup of tea?

892
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,520
Yeah.

893
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,480
- Ain't gotthatfire lityet?
- No.

894
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,120
Drinking the otherfellow's
supplies?

895
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,600
Get back...
I'll send him a check.

896
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,680
ROBERT: Send him a check.
CHARLES: Yeah.

897
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,040
Hell of an adventure,
eh, Charles?

898
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,800
Yeah, wasn't it?

899
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,880
You know...

900
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,560
ROBERT: I oughtto tell you...

901
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,160
ROBERT: If I'd had my camera,
I would've made myfortune.

902
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,160
Made myfortune.

903
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,640
Thatthing's busted to shit,
isn't it?

904
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,800
It still has some...
sentimental value.

905
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,920
I suppose it does.

906
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,600
Can I see yourwatch, Bob?

907
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,680
My watch?

908
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,040
Don'twork. I told you. Busted.

909
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:25,160
I know... I know it doesn'twork,
but could I see it?

910
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,400
New when we left.

911
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,760
Just a piece of junk now.

912
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,760
What's the matter, Bob?
Can't do it sober?

913
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,360
Yeah.

914
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,040
I suppose you don't
need me anymore.

915
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,240
You canfind your own way
out of here.

916
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,480
You had no business
with that broad, anyway.

917
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,800
You know you don't.

918
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,760
You know you don't, Charles.

919
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,520
Hey, hey, hey...

920
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,000
Look at her.
Why did she go with you?

921
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,240
Why in the hell
did she go with you?

922
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,360
Your money, forthe love of God.
Everyone in the world knew that.

923
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,240
Are you nuts?

924
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,680
You wentthrough the airport
with her, everyone said,

925
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,360
'There goes a guy with a plane."

926
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,680
'There goes a guy with a plane."

927
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,520
I'd say you drew tough luck
this time, Charles.

928
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,480
Well...

929
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:44,920
That's right.

930
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,600
Yeah.

931
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,480
'For all the nights."

932
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,520
How touching.

933
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,320
Why torture yourself?

934
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,360
It's over now.

935
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,520
Let's go outside.

936
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,200
Justtell me one thing.

937
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,720
Was itfrom thefirst,
you and my wife?

938
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,200
Was itfrom thefirst, Bob?

939
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,840
Come on, Charles.

940
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,680
Ah. Is that
an indelicate question?

941
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,840
Come on, Charles. Done is done.

942
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,120
Well, I'm dying, so...
what difference does it make?

943
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,000
Why is that so importantto you?

944
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,320
I love her.

945
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,360
I'm sorry. It's time.

946
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,600
- Don't do it.
- You live in a dream world.

947
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,840
You always have.

948
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,040
- Now turn your back.
- You don't have to do it.

949
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,240
The hell I don't.
You know that I do.

950
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,680
Whatthefuck are you thinking?
Now turn your back.

951
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,080
I don'twantto hear
any more of your nonsense.

952
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,160
- I don'twantto hear it!

953
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,520
How close we've become
and how this and how that...

954
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:34,280
You'd have died out here without
me, with all yourwealth!

955
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,960
You understand me?
I said turn your goddamn back!

956
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,440
- Bob, listen to me.
- Don't go anyfurther, Charles.

957
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,000
I said turn your back.

958
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,440
No?

959
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:01,120
You know, life is a shortthing,
Charles, full of betrayal.

960
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,040
In many ways,
you're well out of it.

961
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:06,000
- Bob...
- Charles, don't-aah!

962
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,120
Be careful of the deadfall.

963
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,280
Aah...

964
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,160
Aah... oh, God, Charles. Oh, God!

965
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,480
Aah... oh, God,
I think I've broken my...

966
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,560
I think I've broken my leg,
Charles.

967
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,840
Oh, God, Charles. Aah!

968
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,120
God. Oh, my God. Oh, God...

969
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,280
Oh, God, Charles, no. Please.

970
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,600
All right.

971
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,240
Aah! Aah...

972
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,040
Now, try and lie still.

973
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,640
All right.

974
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,040
All right.

975
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,360
OK.

976
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,640
OK, Bob.

977
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,640
I'll take a look
and see what's wrong.

978
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,680
- I don'tfeel very well.
- Take a shot of this.

979
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,560
All right.

980
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,400
I'm taking a...
just going to take a look here.

981
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,160
Ow!

982
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,880
Hold on.

983
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,200
I suppose I only have
so much of that in me.

984
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,360
- Yeah.
- Charles?

985
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:26,520
Charles, what is it?
What is it, Charles?

986
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,920
I... I don'tfeel very...

987
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,480
I can't say lfeel
very well at all, Charles.

988
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:42,400
Hell of a guy. Hell of a guy.
I nevertold you that.

989
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,200
Fucking shithole of a world,
eh, Charles?

990
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,760
Yeah.

991
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,560
Shithole of a world.

992
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,440
Yeah. OK.

993
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,480
- I need you to...
- What?

994
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,880
I need you
to put pressure on it.

995
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,280
Aah! No-aah!

996
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:03,840
Bob?

997
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,960
Aah...

998
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,200
Bob?

999
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,680
Yeah.

1000
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,000
Jesus.

1001
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,880
Ah...

1002
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,080
CHARLES: Bob?

1003
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,840
Listen.

1004
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,600
We're going to getyou
out of here, OK?

1005
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,080
Hell of a way to end an outing,
eh, Charles?

1006
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,400
You'll befine.

1007
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,800
It must be quite a thing...

1008
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,560
Quite a thing... to have so much.

1009
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,160
Everybody...
wants somethingfrom you...

1010
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,560
Everybody depending on you.

1011
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,000
Don'ttalk so much.

1012
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,200
They're so pushy.

1013
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,200
Save your energy.

1014
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:00,160
I... I don't reallyfeel
quite 100 percent, Charles.

1015
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:03,320
I'm going to take us
into shore,

1016
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,720
find us afire, keepyou warm.

1017
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,240
Hey.

1018
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,040
Why would you save
a piece of shit like me?

1019
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,280
Let's say it's a challenge.

1020
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,440
The sporting aspect of it, eh?

1021
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:34,400
- Yeah.
- No. I know what it is.

1022
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:39,280
You never had a buddy.
That's the thing, isn't it?

1023
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,520
That's right.

1024
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,440
Now I'm your pet project.

1025
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:46,320
I'm your hobbyfarm,
eh, Charles?

1026
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:49,440
Yeah. Whateveryou say, Bob.

1027
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:53,600
The guy who tried to kill you.
That's terrific, Charles.

1028
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,960
Nah, you wouldn't have done it.

1029
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,440
Yes, I would've,
you stupid son of a bitch.

1030
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,480
Yes, I would.

1031
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,920
Well, then... you would.

1032
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,120
What'll you do
when you get back?

1033
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:25,400
Huh? Ah, it's not important.

1034
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,760
It is importantto me.

1035
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,640
I may not go back.

1036
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,440
What do you mean?
Of course you'll go back.

1037
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,560
To what?

1038
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,960
No, I don'tfeel sorry
foryou, Charles.

1039
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,080
Neverfeel sorryfor a man
that owns a plane.

1040
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:58,360
Come on. Hold on. Hold on.

1041
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,040
I'll get us out of here.

1042
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:03,920
Bullshit.

1043
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,640
Hey... I'm dying.

1044
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,000
I'm dying, and I never did
a goddamn thing.

1045
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,640
Butwait.

1046
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,800
Charles, I gotto tell you.

1047
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,400
- Charles...
- What?

1048
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:27,360
I'm sorry.

1049
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,760
I'm sorry, what I did.

1050
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:37,400
And yourwife, Charles...
Listen to me, Charles.

1051
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,360
She was never in on it,
this business...

1052
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,960
Doing you in.

1053
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:49,280
I swear it on my life.

1054
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:53,600
Charles...

1055
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,600
Thanks. Very kind of you

1056
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,280
Nevertoo latefor
a kind gesture, eh, Charles?

1057
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,120
Don't die on me, Bob.

1058
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,240
Don'ttell me whatto do.

Why is the rabbit unafraid?

1072
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,840
'Cause he's smarter
than the panther.

1073
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,840
Yeah.
