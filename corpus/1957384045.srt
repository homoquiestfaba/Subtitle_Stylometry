1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
Although the end of the Cold War

2
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,200
has eliminated the threat
of mutual destruction,

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,400
it has brought on a new and equally
terrifying one,

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,200
nuclear terrorism.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,600
This week in Beijing, China,

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,000
Russian President Boris Yeltsin

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
signed a historic agreement

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,200
to help curb the smuggling of plutonium

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,200
and nuclear components
between their countries.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,000
And at the NATO
summit in Brussels,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,800
President Clinton praised
the ongoing reduction

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,400
of weapons in the former
Soviet Union.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,800
The agreement that the United States

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
will sign with Ukraine and Russia

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,800
will also make a major contribution

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,200
to reducing the proliferation

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,800
of weapons of mass destruction.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,000
I believe President Kravchuk
will honor the deal.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,400
They've already started
to dismantle the missiles.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,000
The question that remains

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,800
is what happens to the various components
of these missiles

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,600
once they've been disassembled.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,800
Unfortunately, international
crime syndicates

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,200
are making millions selling plutonium

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
and other nuclear components

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
to Third World countries
eager to get the bomb.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
These materials are
stored in warehouses

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
throughout Russia and the Ukraine.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,800
Government officials
are not even sure

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,600
how much of it they have.

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,800
Barry Wilkes, NATO Headquarters,
Brussels.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,600
They're just fetching water.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
What about the dock assignment?

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Oh, we're in. Commercial operating
license?

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
Check.
Oh, our boy comes through
again. Now, we're talking.

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
All we need is a year's
supply of suntan lotion,

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
and we are
in the breeze, brother.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,600
Tahiti. Hawaii.
Anywhere but here.

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Where else
you wanna go?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
I don't care.
Just bring a towel.

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
As long we're partying
with some ladies.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
That's it.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,800
Looking out
at the cool blue.

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Ooh-hoo, you know it.
Getting
sunburned, fat.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're gonna
look good fat, man.

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,800
Hey, where the hell
are these party favors?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
I think
they forgot about us.

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,600
Negative. I'll check
on our guests.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's see what
you're doing up there.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,600
All right, you're cool.
How about your buddy?

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Where are you?

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Oh, that's good.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Yeah, keep coming.
Keep coming.

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
Nice. Keep coming.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,200
What are you doing?

57
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Don't talk.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,600
Sweet.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
Here comes
the pimp.

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Here comes
the General.

61
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Where are my guards?

62
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Hang in there, Mikey.

63
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Come on, boys.

64
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,200
Now, my triggers.

65
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,400
Nuclear triggers.

66
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
Come on, General.

67
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,400
Go! Go!

68
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Run, Mikey, run!

69
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,400
Come on, Mikey!
I got you!

70
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Nice job.
Welcome back.

71
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,000
That boat is sounding
better, you know?

72
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You ain't lying.

73
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Here. Take a look.

74
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
Let me take a look.

75
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
They are
killing each other.

76
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Take a look.

77
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,800
Mikey.
Mikey, they're coming
down the hill, man.

78
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Just give me a second.

79
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
You about done?

80
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
They ain't bringing
cold beer!

81
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,400
Coding.

82
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
Good. Jones, it's coded.
Let's go! Let's go!

83
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Go!

84
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,800
Mikey, come on!

85
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Come on, Mike!

86
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,200
Mama!

87
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Get down!

88
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,400
They shot me, Mike.
They got me.

89
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Get me up! Come on.

90
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,800
Come on. Come on.

91
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,000
We're home,
Jonesy baby.

92
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Soon as I rig up,
you just grab on,
you understand?

93
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Let me keep
these guys down.

94
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,000
Give me your hand, man.
Give me your hand!

95
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
No...
What are you talking
about? Give me your hand.

96
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,400
No.
Come down.
We don't have time.

97
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
You got the best chance
of getting the football
off the field! Now go!

98
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,400
Forget that!
Give me your hand!

99
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,000
You're already out there!
Now, go!

100
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,400
Jonesy, get down here!
Jonesy!

101
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bye, Mike.

102
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,000
Hey, easy.

103
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
Jonesy!

104
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Where the hell
are the triggers?

105
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,800
I dropped them,
but they're off the field.

106
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
We got to go back,
there's a man inside.

107
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
Negative! Let's get
the hell out of here!

108
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,200
What are you talking about?
Jones is still in there!

109
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
The op was nuclear
triggers, not Jones.

110
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,200
I don't give a...
Turn this thing around!

111
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,800
We gotta go back,
and we're gonna
get him out.

112
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Let's get out
of here!
What are you doing?

113
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm writing him off.
No.

114
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
You know
the rules of the game!

115
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,400
He's a dead man!

116
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
Turn it around!
Let's go!

117
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,200
All right, guys,
undo the lines.
Let's shove off.

118
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Come on,  Lady Zen.

119
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
Hey, skipper,

120
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,800
I ain't paying while we
sit here while you're
trying to start this canoe.

121
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,400
No problem.
Just give me a minute.

122
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
All right.
Just get the hamster back
on the wheel, all right?

123
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Good one.

124
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
Hey, Manson
family member,

125
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,200
bring me up a beer.

126
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,400
About time.

127
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,800
Let me give
you a hand there,
Chiquita banana.

128
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,400
I promise
I won't bruise you.

129
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Later, cutie.

130
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,000
No, come on, let's
start with the front.

131
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,800
No.

132
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,800
Hey, cowboy,
keep your hands
to yourself.

133
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
Up yours, skipper!

134
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,400
Not again.
What happened?

135
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
Son of a...

136
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I think you killed him!

137
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,800
Yeah, he's
dead all right,
dead drunk.

138
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Could have
used that money.
Another late payment.

139
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
Can they repo boats?

140
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Donny, up top!

141
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Get this
off my boat.
Yes, sir!

142
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,000
Luther,
give him a hand!
Yes, sir.

143
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hey, Church, go downstairs
and check the fuel pump!

144
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
All right.

145
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes!

146
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Hey, Chique, Donny,

147
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,800
listen to that baby purr!
We're back in business!

148
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,200
It's nice to see you,
too, Weston.

149
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,600
I'm gonna go down
and get another beer.

150
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
I suggest you be gone
by the time I get back.

151
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,000
Hey, you might want
to take a look at this.

152
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,800
So, two of them come
on at once, and I ain't
touch nobody's girl.

153
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,200
And all of a sudden, fwop!
One goes into splits.

154
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,000
One bottled water, please.

155
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Did he say
"bottled water"?

156
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, soldier boy.

157
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
Nothing like a handsome
wool-polyester blend

158
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
to help beat
the heat, huh?

159
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
Say "grunt."

160
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,400
Do I know you?

161
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,200
No, you're just
an ugly reminder

162
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,600
of a nightmare
we once lived,
Sergeant...

163
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,000
Blakely.

164
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,200
You were Marines?

165
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Hella strange,
but true.

166
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh! You're what
they call washouts.

167
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,400
Careful, Sarge.
You'll find out why
we washed out first hand.

168
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,400
And you wouldn't
want that.

169
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,600
Hey, check it out.
Brass, 5 o'clock.

170
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,000
Hey, that's Colonel Wolfe
to you, beach bum.

171
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
This prison
is in Kwong Li?

172
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Yeah, it's a couple
of miles

173
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
from that bridge
where your op when sour.

174
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,000
Intelligence thinks
our friend, the General,

175
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,600
is trying to process
weapons-grade plutonium
in that hole.

176
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
Surprised you haven't
leveled the place.

177
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
I planned on it.

178
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
And then last week,
one of our satellites
shot those.

179
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
And I realized,
"If that's Jones, then..."

180
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,200
It's him.

181
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,600
Why are you here, Wolfe?

182
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Do you need a positive
I.D. on Jones,

183
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
or do you need me to
go back in and get him?

184
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,800
Look, if it were up to me,
I wouldn't even be here.

185
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But it seems you two got
some fans at Langley
and at the Pentagon.

186
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
Ooh! Whoopee-doo.

187
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,600
That and the fact that
you're expendable make
you the ripest candidate

188
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,000
for this mission.

189
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Besides, you might
get a second shot

190
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,000
at those triggers.

191
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,800
We don't have
much intelligence
on the prison.

192
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,600
It seems that nobody
that goes in there
comes out alive.

193
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I want into Lang Son.

194
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I want a chopper
at a designated point

195
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,200
10 minutes
from my radio signal.

196
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
And I want to be
left alone.

197
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,600
Done deal.

198
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
I'm gonna be
at the consulate.

199
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,200
But remember,
you're not supposed
to be in there,

200
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,400
and neither is Jones,
so you're on your own.

201
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
Hey, I may live.
I doubt it.

202
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Hey, Wolfe!

203
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
This warm
and fuzzy attitude,
it's not like you.

204
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
How come you didn't
just take out Jones
and the whole place

205
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
with one big bang?

206
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,200
I couldn't get it
approved.

207
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
I thought you said
you weren't taking
any more missions.

208
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,400
It's not a mission.

209
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Man, we saw
the brass.
How long you gonna be gone?

210
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,400
You can't just go.
I mean, what are
we gonna do?

211
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
What am I,
a damn baby-sitter?

212
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,800
I don't know what
you're gonna do. Plenty
of nothing is my guess.

213
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,600
I should be back
in a couple of weeks.

214
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,400
Other than that,
it's a need-to-know
basis, okay?

215
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Here. Keep her clean
and running, all right?

216
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
No, no, no.
I'm busy.

217
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,000
Cab, mister?

218
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You got
air conditioning?

219
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,200
It's good to see you,
my friend.

220
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
Long time, no see.

221
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
Yeah, long time.

222
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Long time.

223
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,400
I saw her first.

224
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Wait. What...

225
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,800
Uh, excuse me. I'm looking
for the owner of that boat.

226
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,600
You've found him.

227
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,600
That's strange.
I thought Mike Weston
owned that boat.

228
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,400
Well, uh, he does.

229
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,600
We do. We own a boating
operation of sorts.

230
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,000
I gave him
the week off.

231
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
You know Mike?

232
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Yeah, but I didn't
catch your name.

233
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,200
It's Kat.
Well, my friends
call me Kat.

234
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,200
But you can
call me Katherine.

235
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,600
Ah, humor.

236
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Ding, ding.

237
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
Round two.

238
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,800
I bet she's gonna
mess him up.

239
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,000
You're on, Chique.

240
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,800
Perhaps you and I
could go out

241
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,000
for a little
sunset cruise.

242
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
Look, I really need
to see Mike Weston.

243
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,400
How about a drink?
Chique, put two
daiquiris on my tab.

244
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,600
What tab?

245
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
She's kidding.
Mmm-hmm.

246
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,600
Um, what did you say
your name was again?
Donny.

247
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Donny. Donny.
Donny, I need to ask
you some questions,

248
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
and you need
to answer them.

249
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,200
And if you persist
with this lame line
of yours,

250
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm gonna have
to hurt you.

251
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,800
Bad.

252
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,200
Hey, I'm here for you.

253
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
How about
that drink?

254
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
My name is
Katherine Weston,

255
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,800
and I'm looking for
my brother, Mike Weston.

256
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,400
Mike has a sister?

257
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
If he did,
that'd be her.

258
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That is his boat out there.

259
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'd like to
go onboard.

260
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I think I'll
take you out to the boat now.

261
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,600
Good boy.

262
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
Is this all you have?

263
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,600
All right.

264
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,800
All right, set a meeting
between me and the Triads.

265
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,600
Tell them I need
a detailed map of
the prison at Kwong Li.

266
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Get me something
I can use, Phred.

267
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Sure, but they
are dangerous.

268
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
I'll get some men
to go with you.

269
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,200
No, no.
Okay, just you and me.

270
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,400
Listen, you just
set the meeting,

271
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
then you and I
don't talk anymore
in Vietnam.

272
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
I want to help
break Jonesy out.

273
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,000
Who said
anything about Jonesy?

274
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
The two of you went
into Kwong Li,

275
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,000
and only one
of you came out.

276
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,400
Now you want to
break somebody out
of Kwong Li Prison.

277
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,800
Here.

278
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,000
What's this?
A ticket and some money.

279
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,400
You're taking
a vacation, Phred.

280
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,600
A nice, long vacation
in Tahiti.

281
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,800
You leave tomorrow morning.

282
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,400
I've arranged it
so you get through.

283
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,200
You need me
in Vietnam, Mike.

284
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Damn it, Phred,
listen to me.

285
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,800
You're getting on that plane
first thing tomorrow morning,
you understand?

286
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,200
Promise me you're
gonna be on that plane.

287
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Okay, okay.

288
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
What?

289
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
You sound like you
don't want to come back.

290
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,200
Mike hasn't called home
or written in over a year.

291
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
My mom's been
having a fit.

292
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Do you guys
have the key
to this room?

293
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
No.
That's Mike's room.

294
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,600
Out of my way.

295
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,600
Look, you
really shouldn't
be doing this.

296
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,400
I'm his kid sister.
What's he gonna do?

297
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
Actually, we're not
concerned for you.

298
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Who's that?

299
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
That's Jonesy.

300
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
He and your brother
were our special tactics
training officers.

301
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,400
You were in
the military?

302
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

303
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,200
Well, maybe he can
help us find Mike.

304
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He's dead.

305
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
I'm sorry.

306
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Check.

307
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
So, uh, how come
you guys aren't
in uniform now?

308
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,600
It was time to leave.

309
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,800
Yeah, and get
kicked out.

310
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
We had this sergeant
who didn't like us
very much.

311
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,400
No.

312
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,000
One night, he and
his buddies decided
to beat us.

313
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
Which they didn't.

314
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
But he did
have us arrested
for beating his...

315
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,800
That's true.
Why aren't you guys
in jail now?

316
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,600
We would be if it wasn't
for your brother.

317
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,800
Only one that believed us
over the Sarge.

318
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
To freedom.

319
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,800
May our days
be long and lazy!

320
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Checkmate.

321
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,800
So, what do
you guys do now?

322
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
We work for your brother.
We're crewing on his boat.

323
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
We're just hanging out
in Tahiti for a while.

324
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,400
And soon we shall
sail around the world.

325
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
When?

326
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Uh, I don't know.

327
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Whenever the time
is right, I guess.

328
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,600
Well, looks like
you guys

329
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
have got yourselves
some company.

330
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Nightie-night.

331
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
I'm coming!

332
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,200
No! Jonesy!

333
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,800
Jonesy!

334
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Police! Sit down!
Sit down!

335
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,800
Okay, okay.
Okay, easy.
Take it easy.

336
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,400
Be cool.

337
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Sir, we found nothing.

338
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,600
Check the bathroom.

339
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,000
Sir, we found this.

340
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You got to be kidding.

341
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
Wake up, slugs!

342
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Wake up, slugs!

343
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,400
Urgent phone call
for you at the bar.

344
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,600
Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down, slow down.

345
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,200
Who is this? Phred?
Phred with a "P"?

346
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay. Oh.

347
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,200
What? What is it?
Is it Mike?

348
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Mike's been arrested.

349
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Good morning,
Agent Weston.

350
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,000
Or Mike, if I may.

351
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,200
Would you happen
to know

352
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
what is
the mandatory sentence

353
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,800
for smuggling drugs
into my country?

354
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,200
More than a slap
on the wrist,
I'm sure.

355
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,800
Life.

356
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,600
But just like
the Chief of Police,

357
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
the honorable judge here,

358
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,200
he's a good friend of mine.

359
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,200
He's going to hand down
a death sentence.

360
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, you might
wanna run that by the
U.S. consulate first.

361
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,400
A CIA agent is sneaking
back into my country

362
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,000
with false identification?

363
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,200
But I'm in no hurry
to have you killed.

364
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,600
As a matter of fact,

365
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,200
I am prepared to have you
flown back to Tahiti.

366
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Well, guess I'll be
on my way then, huh?

367
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,800
Give me back
the nuclear triggers

368
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
that you stole from me.

369
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,000
Intelligence has it

370
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,600
that you secured
these triggers

371
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,800
in a case with
a self-destruct
mechanism.

372
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And that case
never left Vietnam.

373
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
Nuclear triggers?

374
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,600
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

375
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Weston, why do you think
you are here,

376
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
to save Jones?

377
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Where is he?

378
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Give me back
the triggers,

379
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,000
and the two of you
can fly out together.

380
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,600
Together? Is Jones
sitting next to me,

381
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
or is he in a body bag
in cargo?

382
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
My guess is that we're
both in body bags, right?

383
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,200
Mike...

384
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,400
Listen to me.

385
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,200
The war between
our countries,

386
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,400
America and Vietnam,
it's over now.

387
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Believe me
when I tell you
we are not arming

388
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,800
against
the United States.

389
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
General...

390
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
You have been given
some false intelligence.

391
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,000
The triggers
did make it back
to my superiors.

392
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,200
I've got nothing
to give you.

393
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
Neither does Jones,

394
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
but you probably
already know that, right?

395
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,200
Well, I see.

396
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,200
How regrettable.

397
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,800
You failed
to take advantage

398
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,600
of this small conversation
between you and me.

399
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,200
Because, I fear,

400
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,400
it will be a lot messier
if you have to talk later.

401
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
This man here,

402
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
he is Dr. Liu.

403
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,600
Mike, he is
not really a doctor.

404
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,200
Don't shoot!
I need him alive!

405
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,000
Sound the general alarm!
The prisoner is on the loose!

406
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Mama!

407
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,200
Phred with a "P."
You Donny?

408
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,800
Yeah, yeah, let's go.
U.S. consulate, now.

409
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,200
Phred, I advise you
not to question her.

410
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,800
You're going to do
what she wants you
to do anyway.

411
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,400
That way,
no one gets hurt.

412
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,800
Son of a...

413
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,600
Put him in the truck!

414
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,600
You're going home,
your new home.

415
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,600
Okay, guys, I'll wait
right here for you.

416
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
All right, kid.

417
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay, so, who
do we talk to here?

418
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,400
Well, look who's here.

419
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,000
What the hell are
you misfits doing here?

420
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,800
Look, uh, we need
to talk to your
colonel now,

421
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,400
so why don't you
pick up your little
phone there and...

422
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Get him and his
pleasant demeanor
out here, soldier boy?

423
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,800
I'm not with them,

424
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,600
but I do wish to see
the Colonel, Sergeant...

425
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,000
Blakely, ma'am.

426
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You see, Sergeant,

427
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,800
my brother,
a highly-decorated Marine,

428
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,800
is in some sort of trouble
here in Vietnam,

429
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,400
and I really need to
talk with your colonel.

430
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
You keep
that bunch corralled,

431
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,000
I'll see what I can do.

432
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,000
The U.S. government
is doing everything they can
to get him out of this mess.

433
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,800
Our attache is
running back and forth.

434
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,200
Look, my brother
is no dope dealer.

435
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,600
Your being here is
not a help, Miss Weston.

436
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,000
If anything, you're going
to attract the foreign press.

437
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
- Good.
- No, not good.

438
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
"Ex-Marine drug addict
caught with heroin
in Vietnam."

439
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,600
Drug addict?
A headline like that

440
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,800
is not going to get him
any sympathy.

441
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,200
Now, the best thing that
you can all do for him

442
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,600
right now is to leave.

443
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I've already arranged
for your travel.

444
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,200
You what?

445
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,000
Sergeant Blakely here
will escort you.

446
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,400
You are
so full of...

447
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,200
We know that you
brought Mike here.

448
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,000
Sergeant Blakely,

449
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,000
escort our friends here
to the conference room

450
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
so they can wait
for their ride.

451
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
Yes, sir.

452
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,800
They're not going to
help him, you know that.

453
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,600
Is this your attempt to
cheer me up, soothe me?

454
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
Sorry.

455
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,600
Good
afternoon, Sergeant.

456
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,000
Luther,
give me a cigarette.

457
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What?
Give me a cigarette.

458
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,000
What, I can't go
out for a smoke?

459
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
Go ahead.

460
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Jonesy.

461
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,800
Jonesy!

462
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,800
Mike?

463
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,200
Get against the bars

464
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,000
if you want to
keep your boots.

465
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,800
You know we're
their entertainment!

466
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,600
They enjoy the show!

467
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,000
You know!

468
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
What the hell
are you doing here?

469
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm here
to rescue you.

470
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Well, you're doing
a great job so far.

471
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,600
Yeah, you should have
told me you were
having a party.

472
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,200
Right.

473
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,800
I wish to God
you weren't here.

474
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,400
I don't know
why I'm not dead.

475
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
Why is he keeping me
alive, Mikey?

476
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,400
Why does Nguy
keep asking me

477
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
about his nuke triggers?

478
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,200
I blew it, Jonesy.

479
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I dropped the ball.

480
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,400
The triggers never
made it back.

481
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,800
Move it!

482
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,400
Here! Here!
Over here!

483
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,400
Faster!

484
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,200
- Move it! They're getting away!
- Come on!

485
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,400
Come on, back up!
Back up!

486
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Get out of the way!

487
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,600
Phred, they're
on your tail!

488
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,200
Phred, look out!

489
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
Damn!

490
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,000
One down!
One down!

491
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Go! Faster!
Get 'em!

492
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,800
The beer! The beer!

493
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,600
Phred wants the beer.
He wants a drink?

494
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
No, I mean the bottles!
The bottles!

495
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
No, he means the bottles!
The bottles.!

496
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
The bottles!
The bottles!

497
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
Look out!
Look out for the bottles.

498
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,000
Slow down.
Slow down, Phred.

499
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,400
One, two, three!

500
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,600
Son of a...

501
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Look at you!

502
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,600
Now, listen, you got to
tell me what the hell's
going on, Phred.

503
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,400
Why did Mike come
back to Lang Son?

504
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Come on, Phreddy, you're
not helping him now,
you're hurting him.

505
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
They're going
to kill him, man.

506
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Mike came here to
break someone out
of Kwong Li Prison.

507
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,800
The place he's
being held in now?

508
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Who? Who was he
going to break out?

509
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,600
His name is Jones.

510
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,400
Jonesy's alive?

511
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,200
How close is Nguy
to weapons-grade plutonium?

512
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,600
I don't know, Mike.

513
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,400
He's got a bunch
of guys moving around
a lot of toxic...

514
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,200
Is he going to be able
to reverse-engineer

515
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
the triggers if he gets
ahold of them?

516
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,600
Mike, don't.

517
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,200
I don't want to
think about this stuff.

518
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,600
I mean, I don't want
to hear this stuff.

519
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
I can't hold this
kind of information.

520
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,200
Jonesy, I'm not giving
you any information.

521
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,800
No, I...

522
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,000
Mike, you're a lot
tougher than I am.

523
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,200
I mean, there's stuff
going on around...

524
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,000
There's stuff
going on around here!

525
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay, okay, okay, relax.
Take a breath.

526
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,600
Take a breath.

527
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,800
I just need to
hear what you know
to get us out.

528
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,000
I know...

529
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,200
It's okay. Forget it.
We'll talk about it later.

530
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,600
One step
at a time.
Okay.

531
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,800
Listen, you
holding out okay?

532
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

533
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,600
It's good to see you.

534
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,000
Back together again,
right, Jonesy?

535
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,800
Just like old
times, huh?
Yeah.

536
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,000
Yeah, there's
the Jonesy I know.

537
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,800
The light that comes
through those windows

538
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,200
this time of day
is so beautiful,

539
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,200
you can almost
float away on it.

540
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,600
Sometimes...

541
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Sometimes, I just
float away on it.

542
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Yeah.

543
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,200
No.

544
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,400
What's on
the program here?

545
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,400
What is it?

546
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,200
You just hang
in there, Mike.

547
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,000
Don't think about me.
Just hang in there.

548
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,600
Wait. Wait. Hey.

549
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,000
Let me go.
Stay out of this.

550
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,200
Jonesy... Hey.

551
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,400
What's
going on here?

552
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,000
Wow, this place
is creepy.

553
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,400
Nobody wants
to come here.

554
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
That's why
it's safe.

555
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,600
Come on, guys.

556
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,800
We're all set.

557
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,400
Tomorrow morning, we buy
the plan of the prison.

558
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,000
Mike left me
some cash.

559
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,400
Thank you, Phred.

560
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,800
One thing.

561
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,400
These men selling
the plan are dangerous,

562
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,200
Triad.
Gangsters.

563
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,600
Great.
Great.

564
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,400
Would you happen
to know

565
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,200
how much plutonium
will it take to blow up,

566
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,200
say, New York City?

567
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
You set that off
in Central Park,

568
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,200
they probably won't be
trading on Wall Street
the next morning.

569
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,400
Really, Mike, I like you,

570
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,800
but I still
have to have my triggers.

571
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,000
You are wasting
your time.

572
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,800
Let's get it on.

573
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,200
You going to work
me over personally,

574
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,800
or do you
just like to watch?

575
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,200
Nobody is going
to work you over.

576
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,400
Oh, my God.

577
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,800
The smell...

578
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,000
It takes time before
you get used to it.

579
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,800
But we're lucky,
there is a little
breeze tonight.

580
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,200
Hey, Mike.

581
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,400
Hey, Jonesy.
I'm right here.

582
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,200
Apparently, you did
not tell your friend
what I need to know.

583
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,000
Now I'm
appealing to you directly.

584
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,800
Where are the triggers
and what is the code?

585
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,800
Don't tell them a thing.

586
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,000
Mike?
Go to hell,
you sicko.

587
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,000
They can't hurt me,
right, Mike?

588
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,800
'Cause I've been here
too many times, right, Mike?

589
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,400
Come on, tell me.

590
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,200
Mike, come on, say it!

591
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,000
Th... That's right, they
can't hurt you, Jonesy.

592
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,200
That's right.

593
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,600
I'm not feeling
a thing, right?

594
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,400
Right, right.
They can't hurt you.
No way. You're the man.

595
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
That's right,
I'm the man.

596
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,600
I just roll it up in a big
blue ball, right, Mike,

597
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,600
and roll it on out
of here, right, Mike?

598
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,200
That's right, Jonesy.

599
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,800
Jonesy!

600
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,000
Jonesy. Jonesy,
can you hear me? Huh?

601
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,800
Damn it.

602
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,800
I'm beginning to lose
my patience with you.

603
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
You don't even
amuse me anymore.

604
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
I'm going to rip
your heart out.

605
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,800
I have no heart.

606
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,000
Dr. Liu, proceed.

607
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Don't! No!
All right! All right.

608
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,400
I'll give you
the triggers.

609
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,000
You will tell me
where they are

610
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,400
and you will
give me the code.

611
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,800
No. No! I'll take you
to them, both of us!

612
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,600
I give you the triggers,
you let us go.

613
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,200
I'm not going to leave
him here with that animal.

614
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
No way.

615
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
Deal.

616
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
Set it up.
There's four of them.

617
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,800
He wants to
see the money.

618
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah, well, what do
we get for the money?

619
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,400
Map of the prison,
the guard schedule.

620
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,800
It's the same plan
they used to break out
his cousin.

621
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,600
Totally guaranteed.
How much?

622
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
How much you got?

623
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Excellent.

624
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,400
You stick with them.

625
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,800
I'm going
to call Captain Fau

626
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,600
and have every single one
of them deported. Right.

627
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,200
Yes, it's
Mike Weston's sister.

628
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,800
Look, I think we can
avoid an ugly situation

629
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,800
if, uh, your local
police would escort
them to a plane.

630
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,000
Yes, Colonel Wolfe.

631
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,400
We'll take them
immediately to the airport.

632
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,000
Thank you,
Colonel Wolfe.
Thank you.

633
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,400
- Cool!
- Now that
we got the plans,

634
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,800
can you get us
some weapons?

635
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,000
You have no weapons?

636
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,800
Oh.

637
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,600
Please empty your pockets
of all valuables,

638
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,800
jewelry,
oh, and watches, too.

639
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,200
So long, clown people.

640
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,200
Church!

641
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,400
Phreddy, what was
this all about?

642
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,800
These are
General Nguy's men.

643
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,200
I suggest we go now.

644
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
How the hell
did they find us?

645
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Good guy coming out!

646
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,200
Good guy
coming out.

647
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,800
Holy...

648
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,400
Sarge, we've got guns now
and we're not going with you.

649
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,600
Let's go on river.
I've got a boat there.

650
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,800
Hang up.
I'm not trying to
hold you. I swear.

651
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,800
Did you hear me?

652
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,600
Colonel Wolfe,
the situation here is

653
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,800
a lot worse
than I thought.

654
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,000
You're an idiot.

655
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,600
Get them
on the plane!

656
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,000
The police didn't show,
soldiers did.

657
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Look, Sergeant,
I'm going to let you in
on a little something,

658
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Mike Weston is expendable,

659
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and we don't give
a damn about his sister
or those kids, either.

660
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,400
Sir, they're escaping.

661
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,200
You bringing
reinforcements, huh?

662
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,400
You got one.

663
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,600
I'm coming
with you.
No way, sweetheart.

664
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,400
Fine.

665
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,400
Oh, one thing?

666
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,400
I owed you that.

667
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm going to
rip your face...
Hey, knock it off!

668
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
God, like there wasn't
enough testosterone
in this place already?

669
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,800
Hey! Hey,
are you a dog?

670
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,600
How about you?

671
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,800
You don't understand
a word I'm saying
to you, do you?

672
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,800
No. Hey, Jonesy,
you hear me?

673
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
What, Mike?

674
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,000
This is it.
We're on.

675
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
What are you talking about?

676
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,200
We're getting the
hell out of here.

677
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,000
I can't. I'm too tired.

678
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,400
You don't have
to do anything.
Just follow my lead.

679
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,600
No, you make your move.

680
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,400
I don't want to
slow you down.

681
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,200
Six miles
to the pickup.
Six miles.

682
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,000
I'll carry you
if I have to.

683
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,000
We on?

684
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,600
Hey, hey! We on?

685
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,000
Yeah, we're on.
That a boy.

686
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,600
Hey, Phred, how far
away is the prison?

687
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,000
Six miles,
maybe seven.

688
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,400
Pull these things over.

689
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,200
We go the rest
of the way on foot.

690
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,400
Why? We're cruising
in style.

691
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,800
We're too close
to the prison to
be on this river.

692
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,600
Uh, jughead, who...
Who put you in charge?

693
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,400
If you want to get
out of this thing alive,

694
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,400
we've got to
start functioning
as a military unit.

695
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,800
I knew this was
going to happen.

696
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,400
Big man had
to take control.

697
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,800
We should have shot him
back at the warehouse.

698
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,000
All right,
we'll vote.

699
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,200
Vote? We don't
need to vote.

700
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,800
Look out!
Oh, no.

701
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,200
Get down!
Get down!

702
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
Turn around!
Turn around now!

703
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,400
Get to the shore!

704
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,600
Jump!
Jump!

705
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,600
Mr. Nguy, you want me
going down the hole,

706
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,000
you're going to have
to take these off.

707
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,600
What's it going to be?

708
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,600
Can't rappel down
a hole with cuffs on,
can you, now, Jonesy?

709
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,400
Now!

710
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,600
In the hole!

711
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,000
My hands!

712
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,200
Come on! Come on!
Which way?

713
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,600
Go, go.

714
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,600
Hurry up with those ropes!
They might escape again!

715
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,600
Drop them!
Drop the ropes!
Now go!

716
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,600
Mike, the cuffs.

717
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,800
Hold your fire, killer!

718
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Hold your fire.

719
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,800
They're all dead.

720
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,600
Direct hit.

721
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
- We had to bail.
- They knew
we were coming.

722
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,200
You know what they
say about your life
flashing before your eyes?

723
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
I saw it all, man.

724
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,400
I'm such a loser.

725
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,800
Where's Kat?

726
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,800
Come on.

727
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,800
Way too high.

728
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I know.

729
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,000
Doing it.

730
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,000
Take a deep breath
and follow me.

731
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,800
Okay.

732
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,600
Give me the code.

733
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,400
We'll get rid
of this box,
and we're out of here.

734
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,400
Triggers don't come out
until we're off the field.
You know that?

735
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
No. It'll only
slow us down.

736
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Give it to me.
I'll carry it.
No!

737
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,000
Give me the code.

738
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,400
We'll leave
the triggers here.
He'll let us go.

739
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,000
What are you
talking about?

740
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,200
Mike, I'm trying
to save us.

741
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,200
Give me the box.

742
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,800
No! No!
Give me the code!

743
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,200
Give me the box.
No!

744
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,200
Here!
Here's the triggers!

745
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,800
Here!
Here's the triggers!

746
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,000
Here! Here!

747
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,800
Here they are!
Come and get them!

748
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,800
Here's the triggers!

749
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,800
The code!

750
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,600
The code.

751
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,000
Shoot him.

752
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,000
Shoot him!

753
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,200
That's them.

754
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,800
But no Kat.
I say we wait.

755
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,400
We wait,
maybe she dies.

756
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,800
Maybe we wait,
and we find out
where she is down there.

757
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,600
Maybe they find us.

758
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,200
We dig in for the night.

759
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,800
Disappear.
I'm digging in now.

760
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,400
I vote we wait.

761
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,600
Yeah, me, too.

762
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,200
I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

763
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,800
What if we go in,
and we can't find her?

764
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,200
It's not like
we're going to get
a second chance.

765
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,800
Hey, man, he was fully
right about the boats.

766
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,400
Come on, man.
Just 'cause he's a sarge
doesn't make him wrong.

767
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,800
I don't know
about Church being
the voice of reason, man.

768
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,600
Yeah, it's not
attractive on him at all.

769
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,200
He's right.
Let's dig in.

770
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,400
Home, sweet home.

771
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,200
He would've
let us go, you know.

772
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,800
Let us go?

773
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,800
Do you think
he was going to
let us just walk out?

774
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
As soon as he gets
the code, we're dead!

775
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,600
Maybe.

776
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,000
Nice cheap shot, Mike.

777
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,600
Why? Why did you
give him the triggers?

778
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,800
Who gives...
who has the triggers?

779
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,400
You think the CIA
or Colonel Wolfe

780
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,800
cares about you or me?

781
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,000
No, this has nothing
to do with Wolfe!

782
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,400
This has to do with
doing the right thing!

783
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,600
Think of all the people
he's going to kill
with those triggers.

784
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,200
Personally, I don't
care if he blows up
this whole country...

785
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,600
Oh, man...
...because I'm not
going to be here.

786
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,000
He's not even
close to having
weapons-grade plutonium,

787
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,800
and without that,
the triggers
are useless.

788
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,600
Listen to yourself.

789
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,800
Oh, man,
listen to yourself.

790
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,400
You say it over and over,
and maybe you'll start
believing it.

791
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,200
Oh, maybe
I'm not thinking
too clearly right now,

792
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,200
but I'll tell you
one thing, partner!

793
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,000
A year of torture
will do that to you!

794
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,400
You gave me up,
didn't you?

795
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,800
You gave them
my name.

796
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,000
You saw what
they did to me.

797
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,800
You saw.

798
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,400
I never would've
given you up.

799
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
Never!

800
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,200
Yeah, I gave you up, Mikey.

801
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,800
I told them I once had
a good friend

802
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,200
named Mike Weston.

803
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,000
And you dropped
the football!

804
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,800
Because of you,
they kept me alive!

805
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,400
Because of you,
I went through
a year of hell!

806
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,200
It should've
been you in here
for the last year.

807
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,000
Not me.

808
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,400
Don't you think
I know that?

809
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,200
Don't you think
I've thought about that

810
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,000
every night
for the last year?

811
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,800
You're right.

812
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,600
It should've been me.

813
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,800
Yeah.

814
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,800
It should've been me.

815
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,600
Gentlemen, such
a lovely day outside.

816
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,400
I'm inviting you
for a stroll.

817
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,200
Jones?

818
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,200
He gave you the code?

819
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,200
Oh, yeah.

820
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,000
Well?

821
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,200
Hey, guys.

822
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,800
If you got a plan,
we're with you, Sarge.

823
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,000
We better
make it fast.

824
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,600
An American girl?

825
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,000
It's my kid sister.

826
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,600
Mike, my patrol,

827
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,200
they found your friends
from Tahiti.

828
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,000
Hold fire!

829
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,400
Now the choice
is yours.

830
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,000
This,

831
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,200
or this.

832
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,400
No. no, no.
11-15-60.

833
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,000
11-15-60.

834
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,800
That's your code.

835
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,400
Your birthday?

836
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,800
You will
open it for me.

837
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,400
Come out. Come out.

838
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,200
Open it.

839
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,800
Open it!

840
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,800
Wait, wait.

841
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,200
01...

842
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,600
08...

843
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,800
35.

844
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,200
Elvis's birthday.

845
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
What you have
helped happen

846
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,200
is nothing
to be ashamed of.

847
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,000
You, your friends,

848
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,200
your sister,

849
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,600
all of you will not
have died in vain.

850
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,000
Defend the bunker!

851
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,600
Kat, get down!
Get down!

852
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,800
All right,
everybody stay alert!

853
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,800
Base, this is General Nguy.

854
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,600
Laboratory under attack.

855
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,200
Send in reinforcements now!

856
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,600
Donny?
Here, Donny.

857
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,000
Get him in the truck.
Come on. Come on.

858
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,200
Here we go.

859
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:26,800
All right, listen up.

860
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,800
Two miles down the road,
there's a clearing.

861
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,200
You wait for us there,
you understand?

862
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,200
Yeah.

863
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,000
Give me the gun.
See you, Luther.

864
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,200
You okay?
Yeah.

865
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,400
Go, go!

866
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,200
That's all?
I don't hear no fat lady.

867
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,800
She ain't singing to me.

868
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Firecracker?
Yeah.

869
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
You ever get that boat?
Oh, yeah.

870
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,400
Nice?
Sweet.

871
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,400
Time for reinforcements.

872
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,400
You read my mind.

873
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,800
Hang on, guys!

874
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,000
Lock and load!

875
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,600
Out!
Everybody out!

876
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,600
Mike, no.
I've got the good...

877
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,000
Clear! Clear!

878
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,400
This is General Nguy!
Where the hell are you?

879
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,000
They're leaving!
They're leaving.

880
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,400
Tank!

881
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,200
Let's go! Run!

882
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,400
Come on, Donny,
come on!

883
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,400
Run! Go!

884
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Run! Run!

885
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,600
Ready.

886
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,600
Come on!

887
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,400
Operation Nomad.

888
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,600
Operation Nomad,
I am trigger-happy.

889
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Repeat, I am trigger-happy.

890
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,600
We've got a flight to catch.

891
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,600
Bring it on.

892
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,200
Let's split up.
Meet you at the chopper.

893
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,000
You guys all right?

894
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,600
Come on, get in.
Get in. Hurry up.

895
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,600
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

896
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,600
Hurry! Come on.

897
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,600
Hurry! Hurry!
Get in! Get in!

898
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,200
I'm going back
for Jones!
Hell, no!

899
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,000
I'm not taking
nuclear triggers
back with no...

900
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,200
Jones was the op,
not the triggers.

901
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,400
Go, go!

902
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,000
Never again.

903
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,600
Mike!

904
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,000
Lower it, lower it!
Come on!

905
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,200
Come on, bring it in!
That's it!

906
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,800
Bring it down!
Lower! Come on, come on!

907
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,800
A few more feet!
A few more feet! Come on!

908
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,000
Bring it down!

909
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,200
Lower it!
Lower it! Come on!

910
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,000
Come on! Grab on!

911
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,200
Go, go!

912
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,800
- Hey, guys.
- Hey,
get on board.

913
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,200
Look, we've done
some thinking.

914
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,400
Yeah, it's too unproductive
to hang with you guys.

915
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,400
About time
we did something
with our lives, man.

916
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,000
So we decided not to go
to Hawaii with you.

917
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,600
You sure I can't
change your mind?

918
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,000
No, sir.

919
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,600
Nah, they're right, Mike.

920
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,600
They should seek
their own destiny.
Good luck, guys.

921
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,200
Mike! Mike! Jonesy!

922
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,600
We're ready!

923
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,000
To freedom!

924
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
May our days
be long and lazy!

925
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,800
How you doing, Jonesy?

926
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,200
Very good.

927
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,600
Hawaii ho!

928
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,800
Get up there, boy!
