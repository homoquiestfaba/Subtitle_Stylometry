1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,280
Joe,

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,046
I can't begin to thank you enough.

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,048
Your help tonight.

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,844
Even

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,368
I mean that.

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,602
The thing is, Frank...

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,406
You have to drink yourself into the state
where you are inured to what you have to do,

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,047
both emotionally and morally,

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,243
while still being capable
of actually carrying it out,

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,322
physically and, er...
and physically. Practically.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,611
Aye.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,210
It's a balancing act.

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,844
Are you drunk enough yet?

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,564
No.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,445
- Will be.
- Cos...don't get too drunk.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,164
I won't.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,249
- And fuck it all up.
- I know. I won't.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,282
I won't get too drunk.

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,128
I'm not drunk enough yet, though.

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,563
She didn't suffer, did she?

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,608
When she was dead, he cut off her hands?

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,890
And her head as...

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,366
I don't know.

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,131
<i>That's what he told me.</i>

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,367
<i>There was a lot of blood.</i>

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,883
And he got rid of them separately.
That is what he told me.

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,961
I'm never gonna find her, am I?

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,927
You don't know the half
of what this man is like.

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,247
He's a contamination.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,204
He's a vicious disease,

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,361
and Sinada is just the last
fucking nail in his coffin.

32
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,689
- Definitely sea water?
- Aye. I asked Mr Gim Yeung.

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,881
Definitely?

34
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,970
Aye. I said, "The stuff you keep your lobsters in,
is it stuff you make with chemicals?"

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,927
He looked at me like I was fucking daft and
said, "It's sea water out the fucking sea."

36
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,281
Makes sense.

37
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,611
Then your lobsters are happy as fuck.

38
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,642
Before they die.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,365
Livin' in sea water. Total sense.

40
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,048
Right. Are you fit?

41
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,605
Uh-huh.

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,571
Partners?

43
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,969
Partners.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,401
Come on. Let's get Brendan.

45
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,611
Big man.

46
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,250
All on your own?

47
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,086
Brendan, wake up.

48
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,404
Brendan? Time to go home, big man.

49
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,807
You're still here?

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,767
Fuck's sake...

51
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,407
We're gonna have to drive him.
We're gonna drive you home, big man.

52
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,284
- I can drive.
- Your car'll be there when you wake up.

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,607
It's a good plan. 
It's a fucking good plan, eh?

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,931
We'll put your keys through your letter box, eh?
You get a good night's sleep. You'll need it.

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,691
Aye.

56
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,326
Big day tomorrow, eh?

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,603
Aye. Every day's a bigger day.

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,409
<i>Big day!-</i>

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,611
Fucking can of worms...

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,762
Fucking load of bollocks, this.

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,844
I'm pished, boys. I'm fucking blootered.

62
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,408
Put your coat on, Brendan.
It's cold at this time of the morning, big man.

63
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,410
Fucking coat? That's what it is, love.

64
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,762
Fucking big fucking coat. Fucking brand-new.

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,361
I...fucking love this coat!

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,643
Ah, ya...

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,765
<i>HEY"</i>

68
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,002
Oh... Oh, God... Jesus...

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,647
It's all gone down the fucking plug.

70
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,045
Come on.

71
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,684
Get out!

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,608
Fucking Complaints!

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,611
I'll fucking drown, man...

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,409
(Speaks Chinese)

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,361
- Ya bastard!
- No, don't, Bernard.

76
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,649
I'll give you fuckers one warning!

77
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,763
Fucking bastards! Don't fuck with me!

78
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,528
Ya murdering fucking prick!

79
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,325
Fucking gently! Frank, pull out!

80
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,204
No fucking marks!

81
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,288
He's nearly done.

82
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,163
A Little bit more, eh?

83
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,123
Nearly done.

84
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,405
Nearly done.

85
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,521
What can fuck us up, Frank?

86
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,600
What can fuck us? Think.

87
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,724
You're the best at this, Frank. If you can't
think of anything, honestly, nobody else will.

88
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,683
I can't think of anything.

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,367
Can hardly fucking think at all.

90
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,686
The swap outside Bernard's house.
If I work that right then we're nearly there.

91
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,522
I think that's the only thing.

92
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,566
That's the only thing I can think of.

93
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,682
Right. Let's finish this.

94
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,283
- Ready?
- Right.

95
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,321
Right? Ah, Jesus...

96
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,647
- Right?
- Got him.

97
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,287
Make sure your window's open.

98
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,122
There's one thing. With determined suicide,
often they'll attach themselves to the car

99
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,889
so there's no way back.

100
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,005
Now, would a cop like Brendan
cuff himself to the wheel?

101
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,281
Oh. Christ... Er...

102
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,211
You're right. Couldn't that also look like
somebody had cuffed him, a third party?

103
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,406
I know it's a fucking risk, but if he would
do it, then I think we should cuff him.

104
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,522
Use his own cuffs.

105
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,724
Chuck the key in the back seat and make it...
Make it Look right, even though it's a risk.

106
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,161
Yeah, it's a fucking big risk.

107
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,603
Come on. It's the psychology.
If it looks right, then we'll sell it.

108
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,323
It's a simple question.
Would Brendan cuff himself to the wheel?

109
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,840
If Brendan was determined to do it,
yes, yes.

110
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,848
Right. Then we cuff him.

111
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,365
- Jesus! Frank!
- Psychology.

112
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,362
You see, I believe this murdering
piece of shit ran out of bottle

113
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,086
when it came time to
fucking takin' his own shit life.

114
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,088
Aye. And you might have just fucked it.

115
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,646
So? Arrest me.

116
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,331
Or if you like, I'll arrest you.

117
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,409
Morning.

118
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,808
PC Geddes.

119
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,048
Morning, Detective Geddes.

120
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,050
You look like how I feel.

121
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,770
See that? Can't meet my eye.

122
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,486
- Shouldn't have shagged her then, should you?
- How the fuck do you know that?

123
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,409
Saw it coming a mile off.

124
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,525
Anyway, it was her shagged me.
Busy, busy. Can't chat now, Sheena.

125
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,324
Morning, sir.

126
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,001
There's an overpowering smell 
of stale booze in this building.

127
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,965
I had one martini and lemonade
and was in my bed by 10:45.

128
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,128
Big Brendan's Chinese New Year.

129
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,051
What can I say? We'll have to humour him when
he goes on a grump for the next 12 months.

130
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,447
So how come I never get a bloody invite?

131
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,404
Are you getting your eight hours?
You Look a bit peaky.

132
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,807
Last night was too much.

133
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,842
Couldn't sleep a fucking wink.

134
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,247
Had to get up and come in early.

135
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,089
How was Brendan?

136
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,211
Usual fucking story.

137
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,811
Me and Frank had to lug him home.

138
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,122
I've...

139
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,085
I tell you,
I've fucking had it with this job.

140
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,203
Partners with Brendan.

141
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,564
Thank God for Frank Agnew cos I don't think
I could have handled him on my own.

142
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,122
What's the story with Frank?

143
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,040
How?

144
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,291
Just seems so fucking on edge
at the minute. ls it his love life?

145
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,963
Big Brendan said she's a total shag.

146
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,731
Apparently he fancies her too.

147
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,570
She's called Sinada. How fabulous is that?

148
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,241
- Sinada?
- Yeah. It's like Lolita, only more grown up.

149
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,011
Brendan fancies the pants
off anything with an accent.

150
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,122
He fancies the pants off anything with a pulse.

151
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,686
Brendan fancies the pants 
off anything with pants.

152
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,768
Brendan fancies me.

153
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,644
- Long time no see.
- DC Morton.

154
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,611
- Who the fuck's that?
- Fucking Complaints, that's who.

155
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,010
Chief Inspector David Westwood. That means
someone's about to be in lots of fucking trouble.

156
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,403
Dani? Who's that?

157
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,728
- Complaints.
- Complaints?

158
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,762
- Professional standards.
- Fucking hell.

159
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,840
Do you think Brendan reported me for shagging
John Hoey? I thought Brendan was passed out.

160
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,129
I strongly object to 
the inference your visit has.

161
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,165
George, George, you know how this
has to work. Nobody's making any inference.

162
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,680
Then why was I not given any prior notice?

163
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,446
Yeah. I'll, erm call you back.

164
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,370
It allows the rest of your officers
to carry on doing their jobs.

165
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,167
It's the way we have to work. I couldn't give
prior notice of an investigation if I wanted to

166
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,124
because prior notice
would compromise your position.

167
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,848
Which one of them is it?

168
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,485
Morning.

169
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,931
- What the fuck's this?
- Complaints. Straight into the boss's office.

170
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,804
What the fuck are Complaints doing here?

171
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,205
Nobody knows.

172
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,329
All right?

173
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,244
Ellliott?

174
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,768
What's this all about?

175
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,963
- This is fucking serious, Frank. I think it's us.
- Us?

176
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,608
Uh. Not you and me, the division.
The boss is in the dark, and that only happens...

177
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,521
Sheena, have you got in touch with DS McCann?

178
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,291
I think he must be on his way.
His home phone's just ringing.

179
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,641
- His mobile?
- It's going straight to messages

180
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,160
which usually means
he forgot to put it on the charger.

181
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,202
Keep trying him, will you?

182
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,482
It's fucking Brendan.

183
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,682
It's fucking Brendan, isn't it?

184
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,365
Eh?

185
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,083
Fucking Complaints.

186
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,248
Which desk is DS McCann?

187
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,803
It's here. Here.

188
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,442
The one from me.

189
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,729
This is Brendan's desk. 
That's Brendan's partner.

190
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,526
(Geddes)
Where do you think you'll be going with that?

191
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,722
Empty room.

192
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,400
Interview room. Room nobody's using?

193
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,049
Somebody show me the way?

194
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,323
I'm sure we can find you somewhere.

195
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,762
Thanks very much.

196
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,121
Usually got to carry my own stuff.

197
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,083
No problem.

198
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,205
Also, no one's allowed in here at any time
until we're done with this.

199
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,202
What is it you're looking for?

200
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,049
Can't say.

201
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,525
Fine.

202
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,522
Get your own fucking case on your way out.

203
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,769
Take a deep breath cos the shit...

204
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,962
- Did you know about this?
- About what?

205
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,128
Complaints were on to Brendan.

206
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,844
Course not.

207
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,929
- He said it, didn't he?
- Who said what?

208
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,849
- Brendan.
- Said what?

209
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,804
Last night. "Fucking Complaints".
I didn't know what he meant.

210
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,208
Look, you fucking deal with this.
You needed your revenge so you took it.

211
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,847
So we did what we did and you've got me
to thank for helping you.

212
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,328
- Do I?
- And I had my own reasons as well.

213
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,806
- And is this them?
- What?

214
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,047
Fucking Complaints.

215
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,845
- Fuck Complaints, Frank.
- Did you lie to me?

216
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,924
What kind of trouble is DS McCann in, sir?

217
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,162
Let's just, um...

218
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,771
Talk us through the meal, Joe.

219
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,928
Stick to the matter in hand.

220
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,248
Well, DS McCann is... well, you know.

221
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,760
We've been partners for four years.

222
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,767
I mean, with respect, we all know
Chief Inspector Westwood is from Complaints.

223
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,131
Who was at the meal?

224
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,804
Er... myself, DS Agnew, DC Hoey, DC Cullen.

225
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,571
The new girl Sheena Bailey was there for a bit.

226
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,161
But then she had to get back home
to make her man's dinner.

227
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,125
Danny was still off sick.
DCI Torrance would have been there

228
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,881
but he's got more sense and he can say no.

229
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,322
Er... what state was Brendan in
by the end of the night?

230
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,045
Totally inebriated.

231
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,969
Emotionally?

232
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,923
Totally emotional.

233
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,283
I wasn't being facetious.

234
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,449
Neither was I, sir. He was maudlin.

235
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,281
He was self-pitying. He was very abusive.

236
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,845
And he was a bit weepy.

237
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,646
Did he make any mention of any worries
he had about a Complaints investigation?

238
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,842
No, sir. None at all.

239
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,687
Do you think McCann is worried
he might be under investigation?

240
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,123
No. I think he's worried
he's another year older and fatter

241
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,527
and he can't get it up as much as he'd like.

242
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,840
You were in a Jesuit ceremony, DC Geddes,
between the ages of 13 and 18.

243
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,202
Yes, I was.

244
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,170
But you're a policeman, 
you're not a priest.

245
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,601
That's my understanding as well.

246
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,967
Well, my understanding is that's a lot of
vows you broke, a lot of promises.

247
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,923
This is completely irrelevant.

248
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,446
Do you think
McCann is concerned about Complaints?

249
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,006
I don't think he'd have told me
even if he was.

250
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,442
- Why not?
- Because we're partners.

251
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,962
We're not friends.
I don't socialise with Brendan out of hours.

252
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,526
So what were you doing on his night out?

253
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,562
Because he asked me.

254
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,126
Even though you're not friends?

255
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,281
Sometimes with Brendan, sir, it's easier just
to do as he asks rather than argue with him.

256
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,450
And does that apply in professional 
situations as well as social ones?

257
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,642
As his partner?

258
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,964
Do you do as he asks
rather than argue with him?

259
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,765
DC Geddes.

260
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,568
(Dani) He's never exactly
been a paragon of orthodoxy.

261
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,490
You have to keep your blinkers on
when you work with Brendan.

262
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,000
But he's got his lovable side.

263
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,729
Except when he walks in and finds you talking
about him. That's not the side you want to see.

264
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,525
- I'm not saying anything bad. Just asking.
- Mm.

265
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,885
Yeah. The arrival of Complaints
isn't the shock of the century.

266
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,406
Secure delivery for Chief Inspector Westwood.

267
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,602
- I'll give it to him.
- I've already tried that

268
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,371
but Robocop here is only programmed
to give it him himself.

269
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,721
Do you want me to sign for that?

270
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,403
Sir. You want me to drive over to Brendan's
and drag him out of his pit by his bollocks?

271
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,411
Frank, I want you to head over to Brendan's.
See if you can rouse him.

272
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,602
There's no need for that. 
He's not there.

273
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,406
- He might be asleep.
- He's not because he's no longer there.

274
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,802
So Brendan's done a runner?

275
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,081
Brendan was in no state to do a runner.

276
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,044
He was in no state to talk
last time we saw him.

277
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,482
For Christ's sake, he was fucking legless.
Completely fucking legless.

278
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,763
There's CCTV on Brendan's street.
I've got the last 12 hours on disk.

279
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,689
Is there some way I can view this now?

280
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,841
Show Chief Inspector Westwood,
would you, Frank?

281
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,170
Of course.

282
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,682
This is you arriving.

283
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,291
Jesus Christ...

284
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,481
Talk me through this.

285
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,288
Brendan lets himself into his flat.

286
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,725
And I sit in the car and wait for Joe Geddes.

287
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,968
That's Joe in Brendan's car.

288
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,407
Drops his keys through the letter box.

289
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,528
And then I give Joe a lift home.

290
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,801
- How long have Complaints watched him?
- Have you any cause to worry about that,

291
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,841
DC Geddes?

292
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,889
Sir...

293
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,922
Due respect, now.

294
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,285
Hey, I know we all go through this hoo-ha
about everybody hates cops,

295
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,970
Let's spy on cops.

296
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,924
Well, believe you me, 
that's a load of old fanny.

297
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,009
Brendan's been up to some shite or other?
Fuck him.

298
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,568
I've not and I'm not associated with him,
whatever it is he's been up to.

299
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,248
- Tell you the truth, I'm not even...
- You're not under investigation.

300
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,045
As far as I've been made aware by Westwood.

301
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,689
Right.

302
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,887
Two hours and 11 minutes
after you and Joe Geddes leave,

303
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,769
McCann leaves his flat.

304
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,608
Jesus. I could have sworn
the bastard was utterly legless.

305
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,400
DS McCann's not available to help right now.
Would you be prepared to speak to DS Bonetti?

306
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,807
Joe Geddes by the looks of it.
Brendan's done a fucking runner.

307
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,767
<i>There's a Mr Rickson on line 3 who says
Brendan's on a rape charge Thursday week.</i>

308
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,565
<i>- He wants a word.
- OK. Got it.</i>

309
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,684
Mr Rickson?
Yes, how can I be of assistance in this matter?

310
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,445
Indeed I am a woman, yes.

311
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,289
A woman detective.

312
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,764
Arsehole.

313
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,963
He's a fucking sectarian bigot,
a misogynist,

314
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,210
a homophobe, an alcoholic binge drinker,

315
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,882
and if he's not been on the fucking take
from the first split second

316
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,482
he got his skanky paws on that 
fucking warrant card, then...

317
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,889
Look. I'm sorry, OK? I'm fucking sorry,
but that's the way it goes.

318
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,322
I've been DS McCann's partner
for the last four years,

319
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,443
so that means, for me, 
guilty by association.

320
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,721
- That's the way it works.
- It's not the way.

321
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,730
That's the way Complaints fucking work!

322
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,284
I mean, that fucking Mercedes, sir.

323
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,800
I mean, come on!

324
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,970
All due respect, no offence,
you couldn't afford that.

325
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,729
Jesus!

326
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,206
It's taken this fucking long.

327
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,211
That's enough out of you for the time being,
DC Geddes.

328
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,090
Joe Geddes says he and Brendan aren't friends.

329
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,524
- That's right. I don't think they are.
- Because?

330
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,882
Well, you've obviously been watching 
Brendan yourself. Why do you think?

331
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,810
Are you friends with Joe Geddes?

332
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,604
How do you mean?

333
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,325
Are you and he friends?

334
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,285
He's a good bloke but I don't know him
well enough to call him a friend.

335
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,927
- Yes?
- I need a wee word, boss.

336
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,280
Excuse us a moment or two.
Things are progressing at a pace.

337
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,363
<i>So all the computer actually does
is re-flag those files.</i>

338
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,847
<i>- Which still leaves data.
- Exactly.</i>

339
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,602
Data's recoverable but if you really know what
you're doing, you use a deep-level scrubber.

340
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,405
- Is anything recoverable?
- No.

341
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,049
Basically, every part of the hard drive has been
overridden with randomly-generated shit.

342
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,084
<i>The original data no longer exists in any form.</i>

343
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,522
<i>So, when you say a specialised program...</i>

344
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,490
Frank? What are you doing?

345
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,650
I'm finding out where it is we all stand.

346
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,848
<i>- How does McCann know about this?
- That's a very good quest/on.</i>

347
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,646
<i>From what we've learnt of McCann so fan...
He might prove me wrong,</i>

348
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,969
<i>but from what we've learned of him so far,</i>
/ <i>I don't think he's capable of this.</i>

349
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,604
<i>This is sophisticated.</i>

350
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,884
They think they've found Brendan's car
in the Firth of Forth.

351
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,730
There's a body in the front seat.

352
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,129
(Dani) Er... No. He's in a meeting
at the moment. OK.

353
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,004
- What's going on?
- Dumfries ferry on the phone.

354
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,169
- They found Brendan's car.
- What do you mean?

355
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,363
- In the Forth Estuary.
- Jesus.

356
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,880
They think somebody's inside it.

357
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,370
Holy fuck.

358
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,007
Well, fuck me.

359
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,646
A local resident called it in, sir. Saw it while
fishing for seagulls off the end of the pier.

360
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,808
Fishing? For seagulls?

361
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,241
(Dani) It's a local thing, sir.

362
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,806
- What do they do with them?
- Stamp on them.

363
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,650
So...how do you catch them?

364
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,570
Apparently you catch them 
using bread and a string with a hook.

365
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,682
Dear Christ...

366
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,521
The lifting gear's just arrived, sir.
The divers have already been down twice.

367
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,322
Is it Brendan McCann?

368
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,045
I'm DCI Torrance, Black Moss.

369
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,163
- Is it Brendan?
- Diver knows DS McCann, sir.

370
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,047
He plays five-a-side with him. He's pretty sure
he's the individual in the driving seat.

371
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,208
- Where's Frank Agnew?
- ls it Brendan?

372
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,607
Sounds very much like it.

373
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,564
We'll have a positive ID when they
get that car out of the water.

374
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,206
Does it look like it was an accident or...

375
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,481
Diver says DS McCann is handcuffed
to the steering wheel of his car.

376
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,285
So somebody's killed Brendan?

377
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,402
That's one conclusion we might be looking at.

378
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,523
- Although...
- Although what, sir?

379
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,411
That also means we have the possibility
of a determined suicide here.

380
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,128
David, I don't think we need 
Complaints at the crime scene.

381
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,324
I'll keep you appraised of events.
You know how these things work.

382
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,766
Chief Inspector. Parameters.
We have to respect the integrity of procedure.

383
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,283
Possible murder investigation, we wouldn't
want to compromise anybody's position.

384
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,243
- Dani?
- Boss?

385
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,763
Get on to the Fiscals Office.
Speak to Sally Findlay.

386
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,485
Explain this. Get her to call me.

387
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,888
I'll speak to the fucking chief constable.

388
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,325
"Possibility of determined suicide",
Westwood's very words. You're a genius.

389
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,003
You wiped his computer.
You knew Complaints would come after him.

390
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,371
Fuck, Frank...

391
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,247
Somebody wiped Brendan's computer hard drive.
Brendan could barely turn the fucking thing on.

392
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,806
You're fucking everything up. Get off me.

393
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,968
Dani, will you see what's keeping Frank?

394
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,323
No, I don't bloody care if she's in a meeting.
Get her out of the meeting.

395
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,204
- You knew about fucking Complaints!
- Get off!

396
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,130
Frank? The boss wants you suited up
and on the plot with him.

397
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,764
Right.

398
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,450
"Fucking Complaints."

399
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,409
- I beg your pardon.
- Brendan said it last night.

400
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,761
He did say something about Complaints.

401
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,087
- Oh, he did?
- Uh-huh.

402
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,606
- When?
- Last night in the restaurant.

403
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,564
- When?
- At the end of the evening.

404
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,731
Did he?

405
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,641
Uh-huh. He said...
"Fucking Complaints. I'll fucking drown."

406
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,402
I remember. He said it just before he threw
the bottle that smashed the fish tank.

407
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,841
You can check with Frank Agnew if you want.
See if he remembers as well.

408
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,645
This has just come back to you?

409
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,286
I didn't know what he was on about
so it didn't sink in.

410
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,804
I thought he meant complaints about the food.
Chinese. Fucking inedible.

411
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,330
Big fish tank in the Dong Gwai?

412
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,961
- He's SIO on this one.
- Sir?

413
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,446
DS Agnew.

414
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,562
What about this thing?

415
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,010
That's Brendan all right.

416
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,884
Happy new year, Brendan.

417
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,846
I'm racking my brains but I cannot 
come up with a single next of kin.

418
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,451
No wife, no kids.

419
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,166
- I know for a fact both his parents are dead.
- Poor Brendan.

420
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,649
- He's history.
- Any Luck, that shit is too.

421
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,684
- Sir?
- What the fuck's this now?

422
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,291
- What is it?
- Somebody's in the boot.

423
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,288
There's somebody in the boot.

424
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,240
Is it her?

425
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,409
Unidentified male, deceased.

426
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,284
Head been removed.

427
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,891
Seems that both hands have been removed.

428
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,241
And the body's wrapped in chicken mesh.

429
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,808
We have an unidentified male.
Mutilated. Head and hands removed.

430
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,684
First guess is about 35 to 40.

431
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,009
- First estimate 35 to 4O years.
- Frank? You thought you knew who this was?

432
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,883
- Frank?
- Huh?

433
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,324
- This here. You said to Geddes...
- Yeah. Help me find the keys to the cuffs.

434
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,770
I will, sir. Aye. Sheena'll have it.

435
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,010
Kenny, you owe me. Brendan's home address.
We're looking for another crime scene.

436
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,361
Get onto a SOCO team
and get them to meet us there.

437
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,362
- What have they got, John?
- Boss doesn't know. We don't know.

438
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,687
Brendan was handcuffed to his steering wheel.

439
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,327
Then they got another body in the boot
of the car. Head and hands chopped off.

440
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,328
Brendan's car? Fuck me.

441
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,967
I know. So we're looking for where
Headless got topped and dismembered.

442
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,890
Another crime scene,
that's what we're looking for.

443
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,403
DCI Torrance wants you and me to Brendan's
flat. Full forensic, see what we can find.

444
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,444
- Thanks, Sheena.
- Body in the boot of DS McCann's Mercedes?

445
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,488
You think Brendan knew it was there?

446
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,488
You think Brendan put it there?

447
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,007
Jesus, you think Brendan did it.

448
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,168
Any idea of the shit storm this will mean?

449
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,524
Cop kills himself and we find a decapitated,
dismembered body in the boot of his car.

450
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,321
Fucking shit storm of all proportions.
And he was your partner.

451
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,727
- I know.
- You know fuck all.

452
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,890
You know anything, you tell me now.
What the fuck was Brendan up to?

453
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,322
I don't know, sir. I nearly had a 
heart attack when we opened that boot.

454
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,442
Stop fucking with me, Geddes.

455
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,326
- You're his partner.
- I was his partner, sir.

456
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,091
Brendan is fucking dead and gone.

457
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,963
Not any more he fucking isn't.

458
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,882
And unless I get some joy out of you, I'll hang
you out for that fucker Westwood with belts on.

459
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,168
Chinese porn? That's nice. Tasteful.

460
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,727
Hell... Big Brendan, eh?

461
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,286
Living like a pig in a palace.

462
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,729
So somebody planted a body in his car, then?
That's your working hypothesis, is it?

463
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,161
He didn't kill anybody.
Are you fucking daft?

464
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,524
I was at the dinner. Brendan was pished and
happy. He wasn't exuding remorse and suicide.

465
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,722
Why'd he do himself, then?

466
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,242
Look at the state of this dump.
Fucking manky bastard.

467
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,202
- Get a grip, Kenny.
- What, you think he used his teeth?

468
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,723
Brendan's fucking 11 years CID. You think
he chopped someone up in his own flat?

469
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,000
Get a grip.

470
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,045
OK. House keys. One Yale, two mortise.

471
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,886
One Yale, two mortise.

472
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,650
One zip-lock polythene bag,

473
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,685
approximately two grams
of unidentified white powder.

474
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,450
Zip...lock...

475
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,520
See, Brendan's planning on getting coked
out of his tits, not getting fucking drowned.

476
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,007
One mobile phone.

477
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,529
Also drowned.

478
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,207
Probably suicide as well.

479
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,529
If I was Brendan's mobile, I'd top myself.
The man had breath like a stegosaurus.

480
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,003
- You've cheered up.
- Aye. Well, it's being in a morgue.

481
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,407
Always makes my spirits soar.

482
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,567
Wow. Have you ever seen anything like that?
Brendan's shoulders. Did you know about that?

483
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,888
- No.
- They took off his shirt, I nearly died.

484
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,729
Did you know?

485
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,481
No. What can I say, he's fucking incredible.

486
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,483
If they were any slower,
they'd be going backwards.

487
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,284
Who, the lab?

488
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,448
It's either seawater in his lungs or it's not.

489
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,524
Fucking students on placement.

490
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,131
Have to give them something
to keep them out of our way.

491
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,885
So we're happy with drowning
as the cause of death?

492
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,289
Probable cause at the moment.
Nothing to suggest otherwise.

493
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,685
As yet.

494
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,205
I saw that.

495
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,411
He struggled? What do you think?

496
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,640
If he tried with all his strength to get free,
there'd be more damage to the tissue.

497
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,642
- The boss sent you to observe?
- He was my partner.

498
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,809
Nearly four years.
The man was my partner, Dani.

499
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:42,166
(Lennox) Practically an autonomic reaction.
You can't just let yourself drown.

500
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,726
You keep on strangling yourself.

501
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,401
- So he struggled at the end?
- Couldn't help it.

502
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,807
No matter how determined.

503
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,688
Final moments, water floods the lungs,
you struggle like a maniac.

504
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,166
Every last one of us.

505
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,646
(Frank) Enough to break his own wrist?

506
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,490
- Sir.
- (Lennox) Brendan's a big man.

507
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,322
- Do they have a cause of death?
- The prof seems to be going with drowning.

508
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,001
It's that sneaky shitbag David Westwood.

509
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,805
(Frank) The microphones are on, Barry.

510
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,330
Oh.

511
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,285
Chief Inspector.

512
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,407
The CCTV disks you and I viewed earlier
of McCann's house.

513
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,570
DCI Torrance needs them sent over
to the incident room at Black Moss.

514
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,250
As of now, those disks are pertinent
to an ongoing murder enquiry,

515
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,282
which I'm sure you'll agree

516
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,891
takes precedence
over any Complaints investigation

517
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,241
into the alleged wrongdoings
of Brendan McCann.

518
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,524
Tell Torrance he'll get his disks.

519
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,770
See ya.

520
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,890
Come on.
We're getting back to Black Moss pronto.

521
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,810
- We should wait till scene of crime's finished.
- Why?

522
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,322
Because we might find the head and hands,
smart arse.

523
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,524
- There's our prince.
- Aye, right. In a bowling bag?

524
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,804
Come on. We'll wait till Forensics have done
the whole place cos there's nothing visible.

525
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,204
On you go, then.

526
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,564
What?

527
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,410
Come on, you twat.

528
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,041
- You're not happy about something, are you?
- I don't know.

529
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,811
There's little internal bleeding.

530
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,286
No haematoma.

531
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,924
Fairly extensive tissue damage from the
fractured ulna and hardly any internal bleeding.

532
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,883
Which means?

533
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,642
Well, if he broke his wrist struggling,
then he was still alive when it broke.

534
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,202
Bonetti.

535
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,802
He's just in with Prof Lennox at the moment.
Just got going on Brendan.

536
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,447
Yeah, he's up first.
They're leaving Headless till last.

537
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,764
(Lennox) Zero mobility,
so they happened when he was drowning.

538
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,850
(Frank) So he's kicking up a struggle, you say?

539
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,690
These were made the instant Brendan died.

540
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,610
Otherwise, we'd be looking at enough time

541
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,282
for the shins to have developed
extensive deep tissue bruising.

542
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,209
(Frank) so?

543
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,210
Well. . just.

544
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,367
- He was in his seat in the car.
- Aye. We pulled him out the Forth.

545
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,884
So how did he do this in the inside
of a Mercedes sitting in the driver's seat?

546
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,048
Underside of the dashboard.

547
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,166
In a Mercedes? It's Leather-padded to fuck.
At least mine is.

548
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,328
Well, the car's still in the police pound.
I'll get them to check on it.

549
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,126
You onto that, Dani? Anything
out of the ordinary on the drive as well.

550
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,969
OK.

551
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,888
Yeah. Right.
You need to check under the driver's seat...

552
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,845
(Lennox) Look, Frank. This is all subject
to further examination and comparison.

553
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,091
But what I need is a reconciliation
between the times of death by drowning,

554
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,682
the wrist fractures, 
and injuries to the shins.

555
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,289
Holy fuck.

556
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,889
Do you buy Westwood
and his determined suicide? Do you buy it?

557
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,371
Big Brendan. So, what, he killed somebody

558
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,324
and then has a pang of remorse
when he goes to get rid of the body?

559
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,925
The Brendan I know
would napalm a fucking nursery

560
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,124
before he'd countenance
the slightest compromise to his wellbeing.

561
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,367
Would you get that for me? 
Might be Torrance.

562
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,281
DS Bonetti on DS Agnew's mobile.

563
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,243
Hello?

564
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,409
Hello, hello? Anybody there?

565
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,841
Hello?

566
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,930
- Somebody there not speaking.
- Who's the name on the phone?

567
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,481
- What?
- It's your girlfriend.

568
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,683
I must have made her jealous
by answering your phone.

569
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,002
Fuck. What do you mean?
What does it say on the phone?

570
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,171
It says Sinada. I'm saying she must have 
heard the sound of my voice and hung up.

571
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,251
What the fuck's going on with you, Frank?

572
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,044
Nothing.

573
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,727
She just, er...

574
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,445
She just... Her phone got stolen, is all.

575
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,687
So where is she?

576
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,007
She left.

577
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,520
We split up. I don't know where she went.

578
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,369
I see.

579
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,885
So is she giving you the run-around, Frank?

580
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,848
Everybody liked Sinada.

581
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,966
Apparently Brendan fancied 
the pants off of her, so er... Kenny...

582
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,128
Look, just fucking cut it out, will ya?

583
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,610
We don't have time for this...this crap.

584
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,722
Just get a fucking grip.

585
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,848
Even/body out?

586
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,882
Just me at the moment.

587
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,048
Where the fuck's Geddes?

588
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,163
- Have you seen him?
- No.

589
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,281
- Only you here?
- Uh-huh.

590
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,770
I've just had a call from a woman who's dead.

591
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,807
Or is it you?

592
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,084
Huh? Have you got Sinada's phone?

593
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,243
Giving me hope so I don't turn us both in?
ls that it?

594
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,803
Christ was dead three days 
before he rose again.

595
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,284
All the people we see in this job...

596
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,771
You have to tell them they're...
they're gone.

597
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,921
Your wife, your...man.

598
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,722
Your wee girl

599
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,570
And you can see all they want to say...

600
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,444
"Somebody. Please, somebody."

601
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,802
Just saying, "No... No...

602
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,923
"It's a mistake, it's a mistake."

603
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,684
It's never gonna die, Frank.

604
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,322
Tell me.

605
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,048
Brendan McCann.

606
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,009
He threatened her and he said, er...

607
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,165
He said he'd tell you
that she used to be a prostitute before.

608
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,168
They blackmailed her.

609
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,566
All she had to do was 
bring a man back to the flat.

610
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,163
And then Brendan really hurt the man.

611
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,522
All night. Tortured.

612
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,726
When I got there, he was out of control.
Drunk, on charlie... He was out of his mind.

613
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,366
So I pulled him off Sinada.

614
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,724
And him, he whacked me
and I went through to the next room.

615
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,411
She didn't know where she was.
She was a mess.

616
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,920
His gun went off. He killed the man.

617
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,966
Then Sinada disappeared
while I was trying to handle Brendan.

618
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,570
She climbed out the bedroom window, Frank.
That's it.

619
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,049
- Do you know where she is?
- No. I've no idea where she is.

620
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,923
I don't know where she is.

621
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,085
- You told me Brendan killed her.
- I know.

622
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:35,001
Can you imagine all the things that have 
been in my head since you told me that?

623
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,042
I know. And...

624
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,165
That made me do what we did to Brendan.

625
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,364
I know.

626
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,810
I couldn't have managed him on my own.

627
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,687
I couldn't have done it on my own.
I needed your help to end him.

628
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,611
Not just because of all the stuff 
that he's done, but because of me.

629
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,246
For my own sake, for me.

630
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,083
Why?

631
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,122
Because...

632
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,040
Because he had my soul between his teeth,
Frank.

633
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,569
Right. Right...

634
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,491
Frank, Frank...

635
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,011
Frank... Frank!

636
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,249
Your fucking soul?

637
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,328
If I don't find her...

638
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,844
If I don't find Sinada now, then...

639
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,122
then you worry about your fucking soul.

640
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,764
Teeth would narrow it down,
but I reckon 35 to 40.

641
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,485
We'll know better when you find the teeth.

642
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,522
And the head.

643
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,325
- Same as Joe Geddes.
- I thought he was older.

644
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,809
No, no, the same guess. 
Joe guessed 35 to 40.

645
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,084
There's a fucking world of difference
between a guess and a professional opinion.

646
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,930
Take a look at that bruising
at the base of the spine.

647
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,362
Give it some thought
and then share those thoughts with me.

648
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,722
How long have Geddes and McCann
been partners?

649
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,206
Since Brendan joined us
from the Hong Kong force.

650
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:53,600
Mm-hm. You earn twice the dosh out there you
do here. What did Brendan come back for?

651
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,689
I think he found himself in bad order
with some of the locals.

652
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,882
- These aren't bruises.
- What?

653
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,482
This discolouration isn't bruising.
I think these are Mongolian blue spots.

654
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,205
She's fucking winding you up now, Barry.

655
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,723
- You're quite right.
- Mongolian fucking blue spots?

656
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,240
Huh? Aye.

657
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,126
Congenital Dermal Melanocytosis.

658
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,606
Typical to Asian populations.

659
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,371
- That's very good, Marilyn.
- (Torrance) Does it help us?

660
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,562
Greatly.

661
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,128
Coupled with skin pigmentation, I'd hazard
Headless here is of Oriental extraction.

662
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,244
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

663
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,648
Paul Branigan...

664
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,923
Geddes. Joe? ls it Joseph Geddes?

665
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,410
- Dear God, Joe.
- It has been 15 years since my last confession.

666
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,363
- You need a doctor.
- No, Father.

667
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,402
- You've been hurt.
- I killed a man.

668
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,604
I conspired and plotted 
and took violent action

669
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,202
and I killed another human being
stone fucking dead, Father.

670
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,891
- Joe.
- And nobody knows about it but you.

671
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,763
- Joseph.
- And Frank Agnew.

672
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:17,330
Do you know what it's like when you 
discover something terrible, Father?

673
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,886
- Do you know what it's like?
- Joe.

674
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,969
Do ya fucking know?

675
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,849
I'm all fucked up, Father.

676
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,002
I'm all fucked up.

677
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,131
Brendan! Brendan!

678
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,769
Brendan! Open this fucking door!

679
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,805
Brendan! Brendan!
Open this fucking door! Brendan!

680
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,970
Brendan! Brendan, open up!

681
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,485
(Sinada) No... Please...

682
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,884
For fuck's sake.

683
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,285
Shut up! Shut up, will ya? Shut up!

684
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,842
(Brendan) Get the girl

685
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,451
Mr Gim Yeung, I'm DS Agnew, this is DS
Bonetti. If you don't mind, we'd like to ask...

686
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,528
This is about Patrick.

687
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,562
Er...Patrick who?

688
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,922
Patrick Leung, my nephew.

689
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,962
He's missing. Have you found him?

690
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,130
Mr Gim Yeung, when did you realise
that Patrick was missing?

691
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,925
Tuesday morning. He missed his deliveries.

692
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,962
He doesn't answer his phone.

693
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,526
And there's nobody in his house.

694
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,767
Er, what deliveries?

695
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,040
Meat.

696
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,290
Patrick supplies meat to my restaurant and
to four or five other Chinese restaurants.

697
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,244
We have to find other meat since Tuesday.

698
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,449
- When did you last see your nephew?
- Monday.

699
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,289
- Where?
- In my restaurant.

700
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,608
He was having lunch with his friend.
Brendan McCann.

701
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,527
Sir, I'm gonna ask you to take a DNA test
over here if you don't mind.

702
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,690
- This will enable us to establish...
- I know all about DNA.

703
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,721
Good.

704
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,527
You've found him, haven't you?

705
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,483
It's possible.

706
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,848
Would you sit here, please, sir?

707
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,767
Could you open your mouth, please?

708
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,845
Thank you.

709
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,962
Well, what's that?

710
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,924
This was found in the bath with the lobsters.

711
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,722
Thank you...

712
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,683
for taking care of Brendan.

713
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,682
He was a very bad man.

714
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,323
Have you seen these? Do you know that they're
alive when they put them in the boiling water?

715
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,442
Yeah. 
Get that over to the lab to get it tested.

716
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,960
We don't have time to worn] about
seafood's feelings.

717
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,286
I know we don't.

718
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,251
Sinada.

719
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,285
Sinada.

720
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,322
Is that you?

721
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,565
Sinada!

722
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,089
- Get off me!
- Is that your phone?

723
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,408
- What? Yeah, of course it is.
- ls that your fucking phone?

724
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,410
- Show it to me.
- No, I'm sorry. I found it. Take it, OK?

725
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,402
You found it? 
Where did you fucking find it?

726
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,442
- I found it in...
- Where?

727
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,482
Savanna Street, on the pavement.

728
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,602
- Just take the bloody thing.
- When?

729
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,165
I found it last night. OK?

730
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,202
- Savanna Street?
- Fuck off!

731
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,320
Fuck!

732
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,644
Savanna Street.
What the fuck is in Savanna Street?

733
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,004
Savanna Street.

734
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,326
Sinada's phone.

735
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,528
There's er...

736
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,767
Carnegie brothers.

737
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,928
Liam and Val

738
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,450
They own a sauna...

739
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,881
in Savanna Street.

740
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,526
That's where Brendan met Sinada.

741
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,882
What's he saying?

742
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,123
- Hiya.
- Hiya, Joe. How are you doing?

743
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,447
Just, er...

744
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,687
telling Frank...

745
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,811
one of them asked me for a light,

746
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,491
and the other one smacked me from behind.

747
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,444
- On the Meadows.
- Did you recognise them?

748
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,289
No, I didn't.

749
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,322
Couldn't see their faces.

750
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,010
Hoods over their faces.

751
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,451
Hoodies.

752
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,763
I got mugged, that's all.

753
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,802
What were you doing on the Meadows?

754
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,451
Crossing over there on my way home.

755
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,842
Fucking weird way to go home.

756
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,324
Well, I've a lot on my mind.

757
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,886
Are you all right, Joe?

758
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,681
Eugene, my...cat...

759
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,290
needs fed.

760
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,322
- No problem.
- Dani, Dani.

761
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,362
Dani, Dani.

762
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,687
It hates women.

763
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,449
It has to be Frank.

764
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,960
No problem. I fucking hate cats.

765
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,082
Come on.

766
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,089
Fuck!

767
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,085
Ah!

768
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,371
Frank.

769
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,402
What the fuck are you going here?

770
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,685
Er...

771
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,690
Joe Geddes is in the hospital.
He needs some stuff.

772
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,803
- The hospital?
- Aye. He was, er...

773
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,286
attacked last night. He's in the Southern.

774
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,084
Who by?

775
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,970
Er, nobody. Muggers, guys in hoods.

776
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,282
What the fuck are you doing here?

777
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,685
Me?

778
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,643
Complaints business.

779
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,362
What did you get out of Geddes?

780
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,402
I've got a couple of names.

781
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,683
I have Val and Liam Carnegie.

782
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,607
- Brendan mixed up with them.
- The Carnegie boys.

783
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,961
They run saunas and they own an abattoir.

784
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,924
We've never been able
to get anything on the Carnegies

785
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,850
because they always take steps accordingly.

786
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,283
We think that's because they have somebody
inside the CID who's giving them the heads-up.

787
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,721
We think that somebody was Brendan McCann.

788
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,971
- How do you think that?
- Our informer.

789
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,889
Works for the brothers.

790
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,925
A little nobody called Aidan Pollock,
you might want a word at some point.

791
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,371
Why?

792
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,529
- What's he saying just now?
- Oh, he's gone to ground.

793
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,971
LMF.

794
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,404
LMF?

795
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,522
Lack of moral fibre.

796
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,369
Here. I'll take your bag.

797
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,402
- Huh?
- The bag.

798
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,164
The bag, why?

799
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,409
Well, I'm going to the Southern now.
Interview Geddes.

800
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,362
I'll see he gets his stuff.

801
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,562
Oh, fuck!

802
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,523
What have you got?

803
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,563
So far, that.

804
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,682
Who's she?

805
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,963
No fucking idea.
Some bird Brendan's dragged back.

806
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,002
She's way out of Brendan's league.

807
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,042
So he's obviously paid her.

808
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,082
How long did she stay?

809
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,684
Eight hours.

810
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,724
That's probably enough time 
for Brendan to get it up.

811
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,802
Don't look too happy when she leaves.

812
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,007
Means he must have definitely got it up.

813
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,763
Baby oil or talc?

814
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,131
Er...

815
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,889
Talc.

816
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,167
Would you like to take off your big coat?

817
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,490
Sure.

818
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,610
Would you like to take off
the rest of your clothes?

819
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,642
Look. Can we just...

820
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,324
talk for a minute?

821
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,850
Course.

822
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,282
I'm looking for...a girl who used to 
work here a few months back.

823
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,446
Uh-huh.

824
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,721
You might, er...know her...

825
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,444
maybe.

826
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,689
- Come on, a foreign girl
- You're not allowed to do that.

827
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,926
Do what?

828
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,725
You're not allowed to make use
of physical coercion.

829
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,685
And you're not allowed to ask me to tell you
personal details about any of the girls.

830
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,487
- She's a friend.
- You're not allowed to.

831
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,251
Her name's Sinada. She used to work here.

832
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,089
Come on. She's not...

833
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,646
What's that? What did you do that for?

834
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,207
- We're not allowed to answer any questions.
- I just need to find her.

835
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,846
I'm only asking you if you know her.

836
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,962
If you know where I can find her. Come on.

837
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,002
Her name's Sinada. 
I just want to know if...

838
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,042
All right, sir.

839
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,921
He's been asking questions
about that girl called Sinada.

840
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,962
He grabbed me as well, hurt my wrist.

841
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,809
Skedaddle.

842
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,291
Are you Val?

843
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,449
Is Val short for Valerie
like that chick out of Blue Peter?

844
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:33,485
If Shep here prods me with that 
fucking thing one more time,

845
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,206
I'm gonna shove it up his arse
and turn him into a Lollipop.

846
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,889
Fuck off then out, Gary, eh?

847
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,765
So who's this girl? Sinada?

848
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:56,410
If you were here on official police business,
you'd have a partner with you.

849
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,244
Cos yous pricks likes to hunt in pairs.

850
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,850
Don't yous?

851
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,609
We're short-handed, Valerie.

852
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,566
On account of the fact Brendan McCann
killed himself the other night.

853
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,364
- Brendan?
- Aye.

854
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,121
Handcuffed himself to the steering wheel
and drove his Mercedes into the Forth.

855
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,128
What the fuck would he go and do that for?

856
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,405
Probably because he'd been grassed up to Police
Complaints and didn't fancy the jail time.

857
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,006
You and your brother fancy the jail time,
do you, Valerie?

858
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,646
Got no one to Look after you now.

859
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:34,161
Brendan on a slab in the mortuary and some
wee grass sneaking around, telling us things.

860
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,083
Sinada.

861
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,689
Sinada.

862
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,162
Rings a bell.

863
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,126
Aye, she were that...a foreign bird.

864
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,288
Yeah, used to work here.

865
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,124
I can picture her now, aye.

866
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,481
Ankles round her ears, fucking loving it.

867
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,251
Big Brendan had a thing about her as well.

868
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,248
Kept asking for her.

869
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,689
Me and Liam broke her in
when she first arrived.

870
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,849
The pair of us, 
both at the same fucking time.

871
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,287
The thing with the foreign birds is they...

872
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,607
sometimes just disappear.

873
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,124
Nobody even notices they're missing,

874
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,208
cos they're illegal.

875
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,890
They just...

876
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,445
vanish.

877
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,811
Like fuckers in the night.

878
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,010
Geddes.

879
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,684
<i>Get your fucking arse round here.</i>

880
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,291
<i>- Who is</i> this?
<i>- Liam Carnegie.</i>

881
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,322
- Round here. Now.
- (Meowing)

882
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,331
Hey, go on. Get the fuck.
Fuck off. Fuck off, cat!

883
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,044
Where are you?

884
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,321
I'm in your fucking fridge.

885
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,729
If it is Patrick laying in the morgue,

886
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,049
then I don't think Patrick was at home
when he was decapitated and dismembered.

887
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,004
This is the queerest place
I've ever been in my puff.

888
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,247
Do you know what a place like this costs?

889
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,844
Over a million squids.

890
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,930
Aye. He supplies meat and poultry
to five Chinese restaurants.

891
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,407
What do you think was going on
between Patrick and Brendan?

892
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,884
Do you think Patrick made all this dosh
dealing cocaine?

893
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,445
Maybe.

894
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,689
Him and Brendan had some kind of row about it.

895
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,247
Maybe. I don't think
Patrick's coming back to tell us, though.

896
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,322
You know that he's got a jacuzzi.

897
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,088
Upstairs.

898
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,291
It's a double one.

899
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,322
Fuck off, john.

900
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,444
Neptune Casino.

901
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,209
He's a gambling man.

902
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,971
Not a very lucky one.

903
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,651
As well as the ribs, there is a concussion.

904
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,682
How long does concussion last?

905
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,882
He won't be leaving here today.

906
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,122
This is the right room?

907
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,929
God knows how he even got his clothes on.

908
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,962
DCI Westwood.

909
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,486
Well, if that's what the Procurator 
Fiscal's Office require of me, then...

910
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,087
who am I to challenge their parameters?

911
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,604
Briefing at Black Moss
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

912
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,449
You fucking let my cat escape.

913
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,442
Your door's been kicked in.

914
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,283
The fucking state of you, Geddes.

915
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,924
What happened?

916
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,962
That cat doesnae get out...

917
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,924
Well, it's out now,
so forget about the fucking cat.

918
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,890
Boss says Brendan killed himself.

919
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,804
- What the fuck did he go and do that for?
- How should I know?

920
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,081
Because you're his fucking partner!

921
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,328
- You're supposed to look after your partner!
- Oh, Jesus!

922
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,649
So what are we supposed to do now?

923
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,842
Who?

924
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,723
Me and Val

925
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,611
Brendan's let us down.

926
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,371
You've let us down not looking after Brendan.

927
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,529
So who's going to take his place?

928
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,370
Our eyes and ears in Blackmoore's CID?

929
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,402
You are.

930
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,522
The manager at the Neptune Casino

931
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,007
has Patrick Leung playing roulette
on Monday night till 2:23am,

932
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,566
at which time he left
in the company of a young woman.

933
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:50,009
Makes her the last person we know
to see Patrick Leung alive and in one piece.

934
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,361
- Apart from Brendan.
- Apart from Brendan.

935
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,209
Do you have a name for this young woman?

936
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,925
No name.
The manager thinks she might be Lithuanian.

937
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,044
- Lithuania?
- That's what the manager said.

938
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,081
Right.

939
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,571
Good.

940
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,162
Do you have an address 
where we can find her?

941
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,124
The manager said the barman
has a List of numbers for the girls.

942
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:16,449
He'll let them know if it's a busy night,
lots of randy punters playing the tables.

943
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,370
The barman's away, back tomorrow.

944
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,880
- We need to get hold of him now.
- We're on it.

945
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,050
The prostitutes all have two phones,
one for business and one for boyfriends.

946
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,051
(Louise) So it's only the work number
the barman would have anyway.

947
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,243
Right, well. As soon as you speak to him,
I want this girl's number.

948
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,683
The senior manager describes her as 5ft 10,
blonde hair worn loose,

949
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,769
slim build, 20-25 years of age,

950
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,802
nice tits.

951
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:46,401
Excuse me, but I'm being verbatim here.
And a Lovely, lovely arse on her.

952
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,887
I think I might have seen her.

953
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,161
When do you think
you might have seen her, Kenny?

954
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,443
A girl looks like that on the CCTV
going into Brendan's house.

955
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,084
- Is that right, Dani?
- Yeah.

956
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:02,001
- So she's the prostitute. Right, Frank?
- When was this?

957
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,123
Er, according to the tapes,
about three weeks ago.

958
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,447
I mean, there's no way

959
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:11,883
Brendan gets to shag a doll like that
unless she's shagging him for the money, right?

960
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,249
John, Louise, back to the casino tonight.

961
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,689
Talk to the girls that work the place.

962
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:22,361
We need to find the whereabouts of this...
Lithuanian girl

963
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,402
She's a priority, OK?

964
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,326
This girl

965
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,925
Chief Inspector Westwood is here
at the request of the Fiscals Office...

966
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,762
to contribute any information
to the investigation which may be relevant.

967
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,046
On you go, then, David.

968
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,686
Oh, Complaints have a source, er...

969
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:55,441
an informer, 
who is prepared to testify in court...

970
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,651
that DS McCann was selling information
about ongoing criminal investigations

971
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,409
to the criminals involved.

972
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,771
Which criminals?

973
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,883
- Val and Liam Carnegie. Possibly others.
- Who's the source

974
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,002
and how reliable is his information?

975
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,125
Complaints' policy
is not to share such information.

976
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,649
Chief Inspector.

977
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,486
- Aidan Pollock. He's in Airdrie somewhere.
- Kenny.

978
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,729
Run the name through the system,
get an address and bring him in.

979
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,603
Sure.

980
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,007
- Dani.
- Er, yeah.

981
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,202
OK. The Lab's confirmed a DNA match.

982
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,368
Our headless corpse is Patrick Leung.

983
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,051
Professor Lennox also has given us
a toxicology report.

984
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,768
Brendan McCann and Patrick Leung had a high
concentration of cocaine in their bloodstream.

985
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,163
According to Lennox, Brendan had enough
to give a herd of bulls a heart attack.

986
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,406
Right.

987
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,442
So, in summary...

988
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:55,250
Brendan McCann murdered
and dismembered Patrick Leung,

989
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,009
hiding the body in the boot of his car.

990
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,725
Patrick Leung was Living way above
his apparent means.

991
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,084
So we need to Look into his income
and business sources. You're on that, john.

992
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,887
Brendan discovered he was the centre of
a police complaints investigation.

993
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:13,926
This investigation centred around his criminal
association with Val and Liam Carnegie.

994
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:18,761
Now, do we have any connection between
the Carnegie brothers and Patrick Leung?

995
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,323
We don't have the whereabouts of
this missing Lithuanian girl

996
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,887
We don't have the whereabouts
of Aidan Pollock.

997
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:30,049
Lennox thinks Patrick Leung was killed
by a shot in the head,

998
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,483
but we don't have a crime scene, we don't have
a murder weapon, we don't have a motive...

999
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,327
and we don't have the missing body parts.

1000
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,283
(Geddes) The head and hands are gone.

1001
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,530
Joe,

1002
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,967
Er... Now we have a positive 
DNA match on Patrick Leung,

1003
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,608
- the head and hands are less of a priority.
- I know, Frank, but they're missing.

1004
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,328
Joe. In the name of God,
Look at the state of you.

1005
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,489
Is that eye going to be OK?

1006
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,205
Should you not be in your bed in the hospital?

1007
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,890
Should you not be at home, son?

1008
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,201
I've lost my cat as well.

1009
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,242
Frank. See this.

1010
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,762
Aidan Pollock.
Ran the name through the system like you said.

1011
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,767
It's flashing fucking red lights.

1012
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,160
East Side have him down as a 
suspicious death this morning,

1013
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,647
his body's lying at the bottom of Salisbury Crag,
so Forensics already there.

1014
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,205
Jesus Christ!

1015
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,562
You just let your source get murdered,
Chief Inspector.

1016
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,962
Believe this is yours.

1017
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,010
The feet...

1018
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,042
and lower legs...

1019
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,845
have been subjected to extreme heat.

1020
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,564
Was he burned?

1021
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,522
Much of the dermal tissue, 
the connective tissue

1022
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,847
- and muscle fibre has gone.
- Was he burned?

1023
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:48,011
Frank, shut the fuck up a minute, would you?
Let me have a proper look!

1024
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,926
You're always in such a fucking hurry.

1025
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,611
And you know it doesn't help.
I don't respond well.

1026
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,602
- Cos he doesn't Look burnt to me.
- Huh?

1027
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,291
He looks like he's been cooked.

1028
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,970
Boiled, not burned.

1029
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,841
(Dani) What the fuck's Geddes doing here?

1030
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:11,642
- I'll see to him.
- Frank.

1031
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,489
Back in a minute.

1032
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,769
Professor Lennox.

1033
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,006
Aye.

1034
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,771
How are we getting on
with Brendan's determined suicide?

1035
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,488
Well, I've got Mongolian Marilyn
reviewing the pathology findings.

1036
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,767
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You found Sinada?

1037
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,722
Carnegies have her.

1038
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,081
Or they know where she is.
They're holding that over me.

1039
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,602
- How did that happen?
- Because I fucked up with Val, that's how.

1040
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,562
So, what are you gonna do?

1041
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,251
I'm gonna arrest him.
Then I'm gonna charge him,

1042
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,285
then I'm gonna do a deal so I get her back
before she ends up on a slab like Pollock.

1043
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,527
- What deal?
- I'll think of something.

1044
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,362
I'll lose the evidence or...

1045
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,044
fuck up the case against Pollock.

1046
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,162
I'll trade them for her.

1047
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,601
Only if you have a case to charge them.

1048
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:25,167
- Bonetti's suspicious.
- Oh, fuck Bonetti, it doesn't matter.

1049
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,002
If I don't find Sinada...

1050
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,160
nothing fucking matters.

1051
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,771
- What is this?
- Bullet entry?

1052
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,368
Maybe they put him out of his misery,
maybe he was dead before they did this to him.

1053
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,402
Aye. And maybe not.

1054
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,081
- Bullet still in there, Professor?
- Hold the head steady, Marilyn.

1055
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,122
Oh, my God! What's that?

1056
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,369
Probable cause of death.

1057
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,402
Driven into the base of the skull.

1058
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,603
I'll have it sent over to 
forensic ballistics, they might be able...

1059
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,688
It's a concussion bolt 
from an abattoir gun.

1060
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,724
What?

1061
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,969
- How the hell do you know that, Marilyn?
- My cousin's a slaughterman.

1062
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,129
It was him who got me intrigued with death
in the first place.

1063
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,164
- ..It's going to need at least two coats...
- Shut up!

1064
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,680
You hear this, Frank? A slaughterhouse gun.

1065
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,246
The Carnegies have an abattoir.

1066
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,442
The Carnegie brothers bought me out.

1067
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,165
Well, actually, bailed me out
would be more accurate.

1068
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,088
I can't believe the smells in here.

1069
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,090
Ah, well, you see, 
we're top end of the trade.

1070
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,886
Supplying exclusive organically reared
beef and lamb.

1071
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,526
The main slaughterer in top quality butchery.

1072
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,042
We don't do reconstituted turkey slurry.

1073
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,809
Eyelids and bottoms?

1074
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,969
Ah!

1075
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,849
This come from here?

1076
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,842
That's years old.

1077
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,282
It's from an old concussive bolt gun
and they're banned now.

1078
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:18,164
What we use is approved by the EU.
It's pneumatic.

1079
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,446
When did you last see
either Valor Liam Carnegie?

1080
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,289
I only ever see Val

1081
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,608
Once every quarter he comes up
and does the paperwork.

1082
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:30,122
You're going to love this, Frank,
it's a thing of fucking beauty.

1083
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,764
Marilyn finished the report.

1084
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:36,203
Cause of death - he drowned in saltwater.
No question, fact.

1085
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,288
- You've already told us that.
- Aye.

1086
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,085
Now, the contusions to his shins.

1087
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,963
No deep bruising.

1088
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,287
So the injury happened
close to the time of death.

1089
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:49,450
No way these injuries happened in the car.
Mercedes are Leather-padded to fuck.

1090
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,801
So Brendan didn't die in his car.

1091
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,921
Plus...

1092
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,045
Marilyn did an analysis of the stomach
contents and saw something else.

1093
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,491
You'll love this.

1094
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,804
- What's that?
- Chinese food, barely digested.

1095
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,844
Brendan died shortly after 
he'd eaten his dinner.

1096
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:07,881
This dinner.

1097
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,400
Not after he'd driven home
and waited in his house,

1098
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,568
then driven down to the Forth Estuary.

1099
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,683
Otherwise this would be closer to shit
than chop suey.

1100
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,563
Broken wrist.

1101
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,445
Complex double fracture 
of the radius and ulna.

1102
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,051
No bleeding, no haematoma.

1103
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,243
So the injury occurred
after Brendan was already dead.

1104
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,921
So, you've got yourself another murder.

1105
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,442
Fuck that determined suicide baloney.
We all knew that was a load of fanny.

1106
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,402
Somebody murdered McCann.

1107
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,444
Dragged him somewhere else
and faked up his suicide.

1108
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,881
Some sneaky, clever fucker.

1109
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,922
But not as clever as our Marilyn.

1110
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,440
Eh, Frank?

1111
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,282
(Dani) Freeze that again.

1112
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,771
- What is it?
- Step it back.

1113
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,042
Freeze it.

1114
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,842
You vanish.

1115
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,649
If Brendan McCann's been murdered,
then it's going to be you killed him.

1116
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,082
If you...

1117
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,122
vanish,

1118
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:04,961
all that shite you told me about Christ
being dead three days and then coming back...

1119
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,407
Well, you took Sinada away from me once,
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1120
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,842
You turned me into a murderer.

1121
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,609
This is what needs done.

1122
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,642
So you vanish.

1123
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,091
Agreed?

1124
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,722
You agree with me?

1125
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,362
Good.

1126
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,402
We're agreed.

1127
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,161
Fuck you, Joe! Fuck you!

1128
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,329
Fuck you.

1129
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,005
The Fiscal's going to get Lennox's report
in the morning,

1130
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,771
and it's gonna say Brendan McCann
was murdered.

1131
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,962
We're going to jail.

1132
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,282
I cannae stop Val and Liam.

1133
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,322
I cannae protect her.

1134
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,162
I don't know what to do.

1135
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,803
This nearly fucked us already.

1136
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,041
Brendan McCann,

1137
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,923
strong and true.

1138
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,566
Keep-your-mouth-shut money.

1139
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,162
Brendan gave it to me.

1140
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,922
I don't know...

1141
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:32,122
how much.

1142
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,808
Unsuspecting soul.

1143
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,450
You arse.

1144
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,766
Uh-huh.

1145
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,087
- Dani?
- Yeah.

1146
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:56,885
- DS Bonetti?
- Yep.

1147
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,845
Daniella Bonetti rhymes with spaghetti
fancies Frank Agnew?

1148
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:05,488
The most blindingly obvious case of fancying
someone I've ever seen in my entire life.

1149
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,242
What are you doing?

1150
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,282
Is it not blindingly obvious?

1151
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,762
Let it go.

1152
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,889
Kenny.

1153
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,729
<i>Listen. Tommy Carnegie,</i>

1154
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,603
Val and Liam's dad.

1155
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,484
He's in jail serving a life sentence.

1156
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,490
Whipped a boy to death
with a length of electrical cable.

1157
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,530
He was arrested at his place of work.
Tommy Carnegie was a slaughterman.

1158
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,281
The slaughterhouse he worked at
was Culcrennan Farm.

1159
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:01,850
Black Moss is looking for physical evidence.
Link you to Pollock's killing.

1160
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:05,248
Well, they'll find fuck all. 
We're no' that stupid.

1161
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,328
They already have something.

1162
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,771
What?

1163
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,802
If you let the girl go,

1164
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,922
I will fuck up Black Moss,

1165
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,042
lose the evidence.

1166
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:21,284
Couple of weeks from now,
before it goes to court,

1167
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,288
I'll fuck up the case.

1168
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,370
If you let her go.

1169
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:30,970
No chance.

1170
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:36,849
As long as we've got the girl,
we've got Agnew.

1171
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,167
We own him.

1172
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,884
So...

1173
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:48,720
what's Black Moss got?

1174
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:50,171
I don't know...yet.

1175
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,085
You...

1176
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:55,770
are fucking...

1177
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:57,761
useless.

1178
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,769
I'll find out.

1179
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:06,487
I think they got something at the postmortem.
I'll get it out of the evidence room.

1180
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,081
How much?

1181
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,968
- Ten grand.
- You're fucking joking.

1182
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,762
You wait here.

1183
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,848
I'm going to speak to my brother.

1184
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,051
We're at Culcrennan Farm.

1185
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,368
There's a number of vans parked up.
We're investigating.

1186
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,647
John, it's the fucking stink.

1187
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,762
Come in, Frank.

1188
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,124
Have you got a minute?

1189
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,366
Aye.

1190
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:33,603
I just need to...

1191
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:37,330
Er...

1192
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,602
Jesus.

1193
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,324
Look.

1194
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,242
Six weeks ago,

1195
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:50,282
about six weeks...

1196
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,802
I met someone.

1197
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:55,887
A girl

1198
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,327
What girl?

1199
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:02,005
Her name's, er...Sinada Liadanska,

1200
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:04,042
she's, uh...

1201
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,525
Lithuanian.

1202
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:09,603
- The one we're looking for?
- That's her.

1203
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:12,246
The prostitute?

1204
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,920
I didn't know that at the time.

1205
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,724
Frankly, I didn't care.

1206
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:24,290
Er, Brendan introduced us at a party,

1207
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,322
and, er...

1208
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:31,042
one thing led to another,
we slept together that night and...

1209
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,362
she moved in with me the next day.

1210
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,483
- And was this her idea?
- All mine.

1211
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,082
I had to persuade her.

1212
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,640
Where she comes from,
the cops aren't the good guys.

1213
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:51,882
When did you find out she was a prostitute?

1214
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,562
That wasn't an issue.

1215
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,529
She's...

1216
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:06,210
She's all I've ever been looking for...

1217
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,687
in my entire sorry life.

1218
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,722
And I've never...

1219
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,890
felt anything like the way I feel about her.

1220
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,204
Even

1221
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,242
I'd die for her.

1222
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,682
I'd kill for her.

1223
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,606
I'm sorry.

1224
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:45,329
Three nights ago she didn't come home.

1225
01:44:46,321 --> 01:44:48,323
There was no phone call, nothing.

1226
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,002
I was, er...frantic.

1227
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,442
Beside myself, you know?

1228
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,842
And then...

1229
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,882
Joe Geddes told me...

1230
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:07,684
she'd been with Brendan.

1231
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,486
John Hoey just called in, boss.

1232
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,170
They found the murder weapon.

1233
01:45:13,201 --> 01:45:18,082
The one that killed Pollock. Culcrennan Farm,
it's a disused slaughterhouse.

1234
01:45:34,001 --> 01:45:36,003
Come and sit with me, Joe.

1235
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,282
- Sit with ya?
- Uh-huh.

1236
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:43,043
Take a Look at this.

1237
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,202
Brendan gets in his car.

1238
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,447
Goes all the way down to the waterfront.

1239
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:57,008
Handcuffs himself to the steering wheel
of his Mercedes and drives into the sea.

1240
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,842
That's right.

1241
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:04,611
So when does he change his trousers?

1242
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,481
How?

1243
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,171
Me and Frank undressed Brendan at the morgue.

1244
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:18,046
The trousers he's wearing here are 
different to the ones I tagged and bagged,

1245
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,731
the ones he was wearing
when we pulled him out of the Forth.

1246
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,610
Different how?

1247
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:26,689
The difference between
Light-coloured and dark-coloured.

1248
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,971
What have you got in the fucking bag, Joe?

1249
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,485
The bag?

1250
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,171
Aye. The bag.

1251
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,608
Clean towels.

1252
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,520
Kenny.

1253
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,562
No, I'm at Joe's.

1254
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,762
I heard you. I'm on my way.

1255
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,002
Forensics gonna love this.

1256
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:10,728
What's pig and what's Pollock?

1257
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:18,682
This thing.

1258
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,522
Mechanical meat recovery.

1259
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:26,482
That's what they tortured him with.

1260
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,809
Hold that.

1261
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:00,887
Fucking got them.

1262
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,926
I spoke to Professor Lennox...

1263
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:11,088
and then I spoke to Joe Geddes.

1264
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:15,523
- What about, Dani?
- About Brendan.

1265
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,962
What about him?

1266
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,449
He didn't kill himself.

1267
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,130
He was murdered.

1268
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:27,526
Drowned.

1269
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:32,482
In the restaurant.

1270
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:35,888
Bath full of salt water, 
in amongst the lobsters.

1271
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:41,970
You drove to his house with the body
in the boot of your car. You and Geddes.

1272
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,322
You went into his house in his coat,

1273
01:50:45,361 --> 01:50:48,808
came out later and drove his car to the water.

1274
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:54,564
You and Joe killed Brendan McCann
and then you faked his suicide.

1275
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:02,088
- Now, why would I do a thing like that, Dani?
- Sinada.

1276
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,402
You did it because of her.

1277
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:35,928
If what you're saying is that you wish
to make a formal confession

1278
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:37,769
to a crime you may have committed,

1279
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,566
then I advise you, DI Geddes,
and I can't emphasise this strongly enough,

1280
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:45,286
that in my view you should take advantage
of legal representation.

1281
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:46,924
- What's going on?
- Sh.

1282
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,170
- (Geddes) I choose not to.
- Well, that's your choice, Joe, I'm Listening.

1283
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:56,962
Years now, Brendan's been feeding
information to the Carnegie brothers.

1284
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:00,930
Any time any one of us
get anywhere near them,

1285
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,122
he would warn them, fuck us up.

1286
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,367
Er...

1287
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:09,803
Just over a year ago, Val and Liam
branched out from the sauna business.

1288
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,049
They already owned the old Culcrennan Farm.

1289
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,483
They bought a respectable abattoir as a cover,

1290
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,522
a way to get certification.

1291
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:24,245
They take in condemned carcasses,

1292
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,601
contaminated meat,

1293
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:31,326
not fit for human beings, 
not even for pet food.

1294
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:34,728
They're paid £25 a ton to destroy it.

1295
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:38,082
Instead they clean it up

1296
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:40,851
and sell it on for £1,500 a ton.

1297
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:44,843
This, er...Patrick Leung

1298
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,565
- was a distributor.
- Go on.

1299
01:52:47,601 --> 01:52:49,330
Er...

1300
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,006
Brendan got wind,

1301
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,281
wanted in on it.

1302
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,482
The brothers told him to fuck off.

1303
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,205
So big Brendan, being big Brendan,

1304
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,766
lured Patrick Leung into the casino,

1305
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,370
threatened him.

1306
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,290
How did Brendan lure 
Patrick Leung into the casino?

1307
01:53:14,161 --> 01:53:17,165
A girl. A gorgeous girl.

1308
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:22,410
Patrick Leung thought he was spending the night
with her. She spent the night with Brendan.

1309
01:53:25,361 --> 01:53:27,250
The brothers went crazy.

1310
01:53:27,281 --> 01:53:29,283
Good morning, sir.

1311
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:32,324
- Thanks, Kenny.
- (Joe) Patrick had given them up to Brendan.

1312
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:34,727
- They went mad.
- How did they hear?

1313
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:39,529
I told them.

1314
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,882
Are you sure you don't want a lawyer...

1315
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:48,322
before you go any further, DC Geddes?

1316
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,688
Me and Liam killed Brendan.

1317
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,924
Ah.

1318
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:01,608
Brendan was already dead in the boot of
his own car. That's Liam you see in the video.

1319
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:03,210
I helped Liam fake it up.

1320
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:05,242
Make it Look like suicide.

1321
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:07,521
Jesus.

1322
01:54:08,561 --> 01:54:10,290
Why did you do that?

1323
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,762
To get them off me.

1324
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:22,891
Frank Agnew said you and him
drove Brendan off...

1325
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,002
Frank Agnew is lying.

1326
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,042
I asked him to.

1327
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:33,361
At the end of Brendan's party, Frank Agnew was
so drunk I had to literally pour him into a taxi.

1328
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:36,643
I took his car keys,
and me and Liam used Frank's car.

1329
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:38,682
Then the next morning...

1330
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:43,084
I come up to Frank
and asked him to back me up.

1331
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,966
Why would he do that, agree to that?

1332
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,721
Because I told him that if he didn't,

1333
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:54,048
I would let it be known 
that his new girlfriend...

1334
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:57,128
his big love,

1335
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:59,447
is a prostitute,

1336
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,960
who works at the Carnegie brothers' sauna.

1337
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:28,444
John, would you get some water,
would you, please?

1338
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:33,289
Do you want to see a doctor?

1339
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:41,603
Let's take a wee break.

1340
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,042
I have to erm...

1341
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,560
I have to get some things organised.

1342
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:49,840
I know.

1343
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:51,882
I know you do, boss.

1344
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,251
Interview paused 07:22.

1345
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:18,767
DS Agnew, you're relieved of duty
as of this time.

1346
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,171
Dani,

1347
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:25,726
take away Cullen and Morton,

1348
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,762
bring in the Carnegie brothers.

1349
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:29,245
Boss.

1350
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:35,570
- I knew Geddes was bent.
- You're a fucking prick!

1351
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,330
I want him charged.

1352
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,887
I'm not charging him till I have him
psychiatrically assessed by a doctor.

1353
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:48,005
He looks and sounds completely sane to me.

1354
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,805
Joe, what the fuck are you doing?

1355
01:56:51,761 --> 01:56:52,887
Huh?

1356
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,763
It won't work.

1357
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,962
Torrance won't believe this.

1358
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,650
He's been beaten half to death.

1359
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,762
He will.

1360
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,529
How?

1361
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:26,206
David, get an ambulance and a fucking doctor!

1362
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:03,127
- Get the fuck off me!
- ..the Criminal Procedures Scotland Act.

1363
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,366

<i>Goodbye.</i>
