1
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,487
- Good evening.

2
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,156
When we began these
specials twelve years ago,

3
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,859
the artist we're
going to meet tonight

4
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,761
was a struggling unknown.

5
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,228
But these days,

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,097
he is entering the history books

7
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,066
as the number one
singer in America,

8
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:39,337
selling more records than
Michael Jackson and Madonna.

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,407
And he's doing it
with country music.

10
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,211
His name? Troyal Brux.

11
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:48,446
You're at the height
of your career.

12
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,282
A million records sold.

13
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,786
And everyone looks up to
you as a country music hero.

14
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:56,354
- Hero. I mean, there's,
there's that word again.

15
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,891
You know, I think it's
time we redefine that word.

16
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:02,562
You know, am I a policeman
or fireman saving lives?

17
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:03,863
Yeah, in a way.

18
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:05,965
I'm saving souls with
my tight-ass voice.

19
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:07,465
- Tell us, Troyal,

20
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,801
who are your heroes?

21
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:09,635
- My heroes?

22
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:10,736
I mean, that's easy.

23
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,270
You know, the legends.

24
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,438
The people that paved the
way, that came before me.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,907
You know, we're talking
about Johnny Cash,

26
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,943
Merle Haggard, Waylon
Jennings, Willie Nelson.

27
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:19,444
These people that marched to
the beat of their own drum.

28
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,614
- And if you could meet
any one of them today,

29
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:22,915
who tops the list?

30
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:27,922
- Kind of put me
on the spot there, Gail.

31
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,722
If I had to choose anyone,

32
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,489
I guess it'd be George Jones.

33
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,759
- And if George Jones was
watching you from home,

34
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,930
what would you say to him?

35
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,881
Bub Nelson.

36
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,950
It's best when shared
with someone you love,

37
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,250
or someone you just
like to have a good...

38
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,620
- Cut.

39
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,854
- What was wrong with that one?

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,089
- Okay, Troyal. No,
it's good, it's good.

41
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:04,389
But, uh, I'd like you to
relax a little more...

42
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,591
- I am relaxed.

43
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:06,659
- Well, you're about
to have a beer.

44
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,126
You don't have to,

45
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
they, they do want a sense
you're gonna enjoy it.

46
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,396
- I mean, I probably
will enjoy it.

47
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,263
- Well yeah, Bub Nelson.
- What do you want me...

48
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,699
- Just say it.

49
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,500
Say it with me, Bub Nelson.
- All right, I got it,

50
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,601
I got it, Bub Nelson.

51
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,401
- Bub Nelson.
- Bub Nelson, I got it.

52
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,770
- It's easy, right?

53
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:18,436
You got this, I know you do.
- All right, yeah,

54
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,237
I got it, okay.

55
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:19,905
- Great, all right, go again.

56
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,441
- Bub Nelson. It's best.

57
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,578
Uh, it's best shared.
- Cut.

58
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,812
- See, now you're,
you're all in my head.

59
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,246
You got me all messed up now.

60
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,515
I can't even do anything,
I can't concentrate.

61
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,485
Bub Nelson.

62
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,820
Uh, Bub Nelson, it's
best when shared.

63
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,088
- Cut.
- With someone.

64
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,389
I can get it right,
I just gotta...

65
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,924
- Yeah, c'mon...

66
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,325
- No, I'll, I'll go around.
- Yeah, let's just go again.

67
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,161
- Let's go again.
- Okay, all right.

68
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,263
- Bub Nelson.

69
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,799
It's best when shared
with someone you love,

70
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,333
or someone you just like
to have a good time with,

71
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:53,005
like me: Capitol recording
artist Troyal Brux.

72
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,372
- Okay.

73
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,708
It's good. Let's go again.

74
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,909
- Why would we go
again? That one's good.

75
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,176
That was, that was the best one.

76
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:58,980
- 'Cause
we're just warming up.

77
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,211
- That's the best
one we've done yet.

78
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,212
- Yeah,
yeah, no, it's good,

79
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,447
but you can do better. I
know you can do better.

80
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,381
- How much time do
you wanna waste?

81
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,215
Let's just waste all my time.

82
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:04,984
- It's not a matter

83
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:05,785
of wasting time.
- And let's waste

84
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:06,587
all the crew's time,

85
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:07,853
just because you don't
know how to do your job.

86
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,121
- I like, I like that
you care. Just relax.

87
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,321
- All right, look, I'm
gettin' a little upset

88
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,557
and I'm sorry about
that, all right?

89
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,725
- Okay, c'mon, let's
just do it again.

90
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:13,526
- All right
- No worries, man

91
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,794
C'mon, buddy, we got it.

92
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:16,194
- What was
wrong with that one?

93
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,563
- Well, you probably
shouldn't flip the can,

94
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,599
if you're gonna

95
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,532
crack open and drink-
- I like the flipping the can,

96
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:20,635
the flipping the can's cool.

97
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,034
It shows I can do the trick.
- But, it's not gonna work.

98
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,234
- It shows I've got talent.
It's not gonna work

99
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:23,903
if you can't drink it.
- The whole point

100
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:24,706
of you hiring me

101
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:25,640
is because I have talent.
- Naturally.

102
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,039
- Look how I can do it.
- Troyal, I think it's great.

103
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,206
Look, I can keep on flipping.
- 'Cause if it works,

104
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:28,976
you were, like...
- I flip it right every time.

105
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,442
I can juggle it.
- No, I, I, I, I don't...

106
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,242
- I can juggle the whole fuckin'
thing, how 'bout that, huh?

107
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,044
- I don't want that.

108
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:32,712
- I don't want that.

109
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:33,614
- I got ideas.

110
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,014
Let's just try again,
try again, try again.

111
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,148
Let's just do it all f...
- Yeah!

112
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,516
Bub Nelson.

113
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,283
It's best when shared with...

114
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,217
- Cut it.

115
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,054
- What the fuck was that?

116
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,721
- Boom in the shot.
- Yeah, boom in the shot.

117
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,189
He fucking hit me in
the god damn head.

118
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,826
He could have hurt somebody.

119
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,525
He could poke somebody's eye
out with that fuckin' thing.

120
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,593
- C'mon, let's
just take a sec, let's settle.

121
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,396
- Piss juice.

122
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,200
- Cut!

123
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:21,493
- Do you think Dad will be
home for Christmas this year?

124
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,764
- I don't know.

125
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,100
- Last year we weren't so lucky.

126
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:28,936
- Yeah.

127
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,106
- Maybe this year
will be different.

128
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,440
- I don't think so.

129
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,511
- Now, boys.

130
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:39,779
I don't wanna hear no guff

131
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,147
outta neither one
of you this year,

132
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,349
if your daddy can't
be home for Christmas.

133
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,551
- Yes, mama.

134
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,254
- He provides for us, tenfold.

135
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:52,423
Last thing we need is
to make him feel guilty.

136
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,626
These are his prime years,

137
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,894
and he needs to
make the best of it,

138
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:57,763
'cause tomorrow it
could all go away.

139
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,497
You understand what
I'm sayin', boys?

140
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,332
- Yes, mama.

141
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,835
- Nicholas?

142
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,036
- Yes, mama.

143
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,704
- All right.

144
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,608
Now, come here, babies.

145
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,815
- Well, what do we
got goin' on here?

146
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,650
- Dad's home!

147
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:21,454
- Why don't you boys go
give your daddy a hug?

148
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:27,458
- I don't know what I
did to deserve this.

149
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,797
- Letter came for you today.

150
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,399
You didn't eat much.

151
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,308
You know, I worry about you
not eating enough, Troyal.

152
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,776
You got a long way to go,

153
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:46,312
and it's best to start
gettin' some good habits.

154
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:48,479
Earlier, the better.

155
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,916
Your mom and dad could
both die of heart failure

156
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,450
on the same day,

157
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:56,722
I guarantee you, it's 'cause
they weren't eatin' right.

158
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,123
This family's seen
enough tragedy

159
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,793
in the time that I've
been a part of it.

160
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:04,362
I just want you to see
your children grow up.

161
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,664
Is that too much to ask?

162
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,233
- Baby, do you know
who wrote this letter?

163
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:08,801
- Somebody named Jones.

164
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,502
- Oh yeah, somebody
named Jones, yeah.

165
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,338
Try George Jones.

166
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,608
- George Jones?

167
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,543
You mean "George
Jones" George Jones?

168
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,011
- The George Jones.

169
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:20,946
The greatest country and
western singer of all time.

170
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,214
- Well,
Troyal had said it,

171
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,149
but knew in his heart
that it was hyperbole.

172
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,951
It was unspoken
knowledge that the title

173
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,554
of the greatest country and
western singer of all time

174
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,923
belonged to none other
than one Roger Nelson,

175
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,591
who had written some
of the most unique

176
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,927
and thought-provoking
material of the genre.

177
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,395
The night before he was to
walk into the recording studio

178
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,232
for the first time
in the fall of 1976,

179
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,834
Roger was stabbed
by a homeless man

180
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:44,770
and died in a ditch with only
his ideas to keep him warm.

181
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,338
- Well, what'd he
say in the letter?

182
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,807
- He wants me to go see
him off in Nashville.

183
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,408
- See him off?

184
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,644
Where's he going?

185
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:52,578
- It doesn't matter
where he's going,

186
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,014
it matters where he's been.

187
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,481
- How old is he now?

188
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,951
- I don't know, he's
prob'ly gettin' up there.

189
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:01,053
One country legend to
another country legend,

190
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,487
wants me to come out there,

191
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,156
hang out with him.

192
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,391
Of course, it's this weekend.

193
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:06,625
- Oh, baby, this weekend?

194
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,761
The boys will want you
to play catch with them.

195
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,996
You know, we're all

196
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,532
just really glad to have
you home for a while.

197
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,000
- And I appreciate that,

198
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:15,801
and I appreciate this
whole Betty Crocker thing

199
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,069
we got going on here.

200
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,570
This Norman Rockwell painting.
- Oh, you do?

201
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,105
Oh, well that's good to know.
- Yeah, but I can come back

202
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,807
and, uh, play catch outside
with Nicholas and Christoff

203
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,474
any day of the week.

204
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,442
- Christopher.

205
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,844
- That's what I said.

206
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,147
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

207
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,049
I got this locked down.

208
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,318
I make nothing but hit
records and baby boys.

209
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,585
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,253
Ain't that right?
- You do.

211
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:35,187
- Yes I do.

212
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,989
- But that's not the point.

213
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,425
- Baby, I idolize this man.
Do you understand that?

214
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:41,060
- I know you do.

215
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:42,795
But you know who
those boys idolize?

216
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:43,963
- Probably one of those stupid

217
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,130
cartoon characters they watch.

218
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,734
- No. Their father.

219
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,903
They idolize you, baby.

220
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,041
- Maybe I'll, uh, get 'em
a souvenir or somethin'

221
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:59,078
while I'm out in Nashville.

222
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,347
- Oh, I'm sure you will, baby.

223
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,481
- Probably something
big and extravagant.

224
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,725
George motherfuckin' Jones.

225
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:18,697
Hey, can I get more
vocals in my monitor?

226
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,369
Y'all ain't gonna guess
where I'm going this weekend.

227
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:24,536
- Where you goin', Troyal?

228
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,738
- Nashville, Tennessee.

229
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,139
- What you got goin'
on in Nashville?

230
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,641
- How about dinner and
drinks with a country legend?

231
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,110
- Waylon Jennings?

232
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,611
- No, not Waylon Jennings, it's
a different country legend.

233
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,979
- Oh is it, is it Johnny Cash?

234
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,014
- No, God.

235
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,515
It's George Jones.

236
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,416
- You gonna drink
with The Possum?

237
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,717
- Yeah, The Possum.

238
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,818
See, he knows what
I'm talkin' about.

239
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,020
- Whatever happened to him?

240
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,287
- I heard he drowned
in a bottle of whiskey.

241
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,023
- Nope, he got
clean, he's sober.

242
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:47,326
- All of a sudden, y'all know
so much about George Jones.

243
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,561
Anyway, yeah, he invited me out.

244
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,030
To Nashville, Tennessee.

245
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,432
For dinner and drinks, which
is an industry standard.

246
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,200
'Cause one legend wants to
hang out with another legend,

247
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,635
'cause we have the
most in common.

248
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,604
You guys will understand
when you're more established.

249
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,073
Bottom line is we're
probably gonna get drunk.

250
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,608
- Well, how come you
don't get drunk with us?

251
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,842
- I do get drunk with you guys.

252
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,711
I get drunk with you
guys all the time.

253
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:06,945
- You don't drink like that.

254
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,180
- That is
so frustrating.

255
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,214
I could drink any one of
y'all under the table,

256
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,449
except for Melvin.

257
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:12,017
- Well, you can't outdrink me.

258
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,453
- I'm talkin' about in like a
competition-type setting, Ray.

259
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:16,555
Like, if there's four or
five beers in front of us,

260
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,823
I get to number four,

261
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,024
you'll be at number three.

262
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,259
Which is more of a speed thing,

263
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:23,362
but I think they also
count for quantity.

264
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,763
- I think it's pretty cool.

265
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,131
- Oh, there goes Melvin.

266
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,067
The only one with any
sense in this band.

267
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,669
Of course, his playing
could be improved upon.

268
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:31,739
Let's hit it.

269
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,806
- One, two, three, four.

270
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,513
- Before you ask
me why I'm late,

271
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:41,548
you need to be askin' yourself
why I'm still messin' around

272
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,148
with these
bottom-feeder bandmates.

273
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,683
- They got a special here,

274
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,286
it's a pear-glazed pork
loin with basil droppings.

275
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:48,887
- Pear-glazed pork loin
with basil droppin's,

276
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,123
that's, that's what it's
come to now, hasn't it?

277
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,491
- Yeah, I better not
commit to the calories

278
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:54,159
this early in the afternoon.

279
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,327
- I'll tell you what,

280
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,261
I'll commit to whatever
calories they got,

281
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,429
as long as you're buying.

282
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,897
- Well, that's
protocol, isn't it?

283
00:09:58,899 --> 00:09:59,698
- That's probably the
best thing we got goin' on

284
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,866
with this relationship.

285
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,204
- Here's what I got for you.

286
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,239
This weekend down in Dallas is
Governor Richards' birthday.

287
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,007
You're gonna go down
there, play a few songs,

288
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,210
shake a few hands, kiss a baby.

289
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,911
You jump back over
the Red River,

290
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,514
$25,000 richer.

291
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:15,647
That's take-home money.

292
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,882
That's in your pocket.

293
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:17,916
That's after fees.

294
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,384
That's after my fees.

295
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,819
The boys, they get
their minimum wage,

296
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,020
travel costs, all that.

297
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,523
- Well, that sounds
real tempting,

298
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:26,125
except for I'll be in Nashville,
Tennessee this weekend.

299
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,693
- You don't have anything
in Nashville this weekend.

300
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,628
- No, this ain't in the books.

301
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,863
See, I'm gonna be hangin' out

302
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:31,797
with a country and
western legend.

303
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,599
Maybe you've heard of him.

304
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:33,799
His name's George Jones?

305
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,868
- You're recordin'
songs with George Jones?

306
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,902
- No, we're not gonna
be recordin', man.

307
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,203
We're just gonna be hangin' out,

308
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,238
sitting across from each other.

309
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,439
Mind-meldin'.

310
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,974
- Like, talkin' 'bout
future projects?

311
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,242
- I don't know what we're
gonna be talkin' about, man.

312
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,577
We're just gonna be
shootin' the shit.

313
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,844
- Are you tellin' me

314
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,515
that you're willing to
throw away 25 grand,

315
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:51,016
to go have soup with a
60-year-old, washed-up

316
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,585
has-been possum?

317
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,686
- Well, you make it sound
better than it actually is,

318
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,288
but yeah.

319
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,625
Uh, I'm gonna have, uh,
American cheeseburger,

320
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,593
and this guy's gonna have
the pork loin pear glaze.

321
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:02,694
How about that, huh?

322
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:03,530
Thank you.

323
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:04,763
- I don't understand.

324
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,231
All right, this, this
isn't Hank Williams Jr.

325
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,699
This isn't Charley Pride.

326
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,169
This is a, this is an
old man that's washed up.

327
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,604
He's trying to get what you got.

328
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:13,372
- Look, I have been
a fan of George Jones

329
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:14,873
since I was a wee
little baby boy.

330
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,576
Now, this is a golden
opportunity for me,

331
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:17,976
and I'm definitely not
gonna let it pass me by

332
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,512
over some money.

333
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:21,514
- Well, that's why the people
love you, isn't it, Troyal?

334
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:22,414
It's that passion.

335
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,551
- God damn right.

336
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,118
- I met my hero once.

337
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,952
- Yeah?

338
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,153
- Yeah.

339
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,288
It was in Boston
at a charity event.

340
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,756
Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.

341
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,525
- You met Joe DiMaggio
at a charity event?

342
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:33,458
- Isn't that something?

343
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,693
- Well, it's a small world.

344
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,361
- I walked up to him,
I introduced myself.

345
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,696
I shook his hand.

346
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,131
I thought that'd be
where we left off.

347
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,465
But no, we got to talkin',

348
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,900
we were havin' a good time.

349
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,536
Our ladies started talkin',
we're out to dinner,

350
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:45,070
and I got his number, and
I can call him right now.

351
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,305
- You can call Joe
DiMaggio right now?

352
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,873
- I can call Joe
DiMaggio right now.

353
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,609
Pick up the phone, I
can talk about baseball,

354
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:52,144
I can talk about the wind.

355
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,445
- See, that's,
that's the same thing

356
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,713
that's gonna happen
with me and George.

357
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,682
I'm gonna go out there,
we're gonna hang out.

358
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:56,949
We're gonna become best friends.

359
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,250
He's gonna be sending
me Christmas cards.

360
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,718
I'm gonna be sending
him Christmas cards.

361
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,153
Hell, we're gonna have
things to do with each other

362
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,888
that don't even revolve
around Christmas.

363
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,424
Shit, I'm gonna have a room
for him to stay at my house.

364
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:06,659
Man, I'm gonna have
a bunch of rooms,

365
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:08,227
for a bunch of country
and western legends.

366
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,962
My house is gonna be the,
like, the United Nations

367
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,263
for country and western legends.

368
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,566
- Wouldn't get 'em all
booked at the same time.

369
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,133
You know, you keep talkin'
about what you wanna do,

370
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,401
and hope somethin' will happen,

371
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,071
and you don't do it
and it won't happen.

372
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,573
- Well, that's a nice sentiment.

373
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:22,609
Except for in this
case, it doesn't work.

374
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,644
'Cause I am makin' it happen.

375
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:27,680
- Well, that's a Joe
DiMaggio quote, Troyal.

376
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:29,181
- Well, it's a good quote.

377
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,949
- Y'know, the first time a
reporter asked Joe DiMaggio

378
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,017
for a quote,

379
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,252
he thought it was a soda pop.

380
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,287
Isn't that funny?

381
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,723
- Kind of slow, then, isn't he?

382
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,923
- Well, he's not slow, he's,

383
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,157
he's a center fielder.

384
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,593
And, you know, he,
he was a rookie.

385
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,094
I'd like to see
your rookie card.

386
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,530
- My rookie card? Shit,
it'd be filled with stats.

387
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:47,600
The whole back side, just
nothin' but stats, printin'...

388
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,702
- Whole lot of strikeouts.
- Numbers. Well...

389
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:53,038
- They might let
you play first base.

390
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,759
- Baby?

391
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:47,861
- Yeah, baby?

392
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:52,898
- Why do you think George
Jones wrote me that letter?

393
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,568
- 'Cause he wants to
spend time with you.

394
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,705
Everyone does.

395
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,774
- There's not enough time
in the world for that.

396
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:05,310
But that, that doesn't
sit right with me.

397
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,012
I mean, he's an icon.

398
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,350
And I'm bound to be an icon.

399
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:15,387
If he's on his victory lap,
I'm, I'm on the home stretch.

400
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,125
- Yeah, you're on
your way, baby.

401
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:20,992
- Maybe he feels a
connection to my music,

402
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,630
the way I felt a connection
to his growing up.

403
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,734
- Yeah, baby.

404
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,568
- Maybe it's one great
artist reachin' out

405
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,137
to another great artist so
he doesn't feel so lonely.

406
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,642
I know what that's like, hell.

407
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,810
- Good night, baby.

408
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:38,747
I love you.

409
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:41,683
- Good night.

410
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:48,857
- Troyal?

411
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:50,725
- Yeah.

412
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:54,361
- I feel like we're losing you.

413
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,033
- Why would you say that?

414
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,566
- Dear Troyal,

415
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,768
I'm writin' to
you today in hopes

416
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,539
you're doin' well and
your family is thriving.

417
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,774
I watched your special
the other night on TV

418
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:46,211
and I have to admit, it left
quite an impression on me.

419
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:49,347
I was touched by your
words and appreciate them

420
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,651
more than you know.

421
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:52,951
You seem to be well on your way

422
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,356
to becoming a country
superstar yourself.

423
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,225
I would like to invite
you back to Nashville

424
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,829
next weekend if you are free.

425
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,598
I'm taking a very
extended vacation soon

426
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,001
and it would be an honor if
I could meet you before I go.

427
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,971
I understand if you're
too busy to accept.

428
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,542
Best, George Jones.

429
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:28,881
- Welcome to Nashville.

430
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,415
- Howdy doody.

431
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,184
They got me here a reservation
right here for Travis Wiley.

432
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,053
- Travis Wiley, let me see.

433
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,389
- That's kind a stupid name
and I didn't come up with it.

434
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,626
You might wanna check who
made that reservation.

435
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:43,461
- Capitol Records?
Are you a musician?

436
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,531
- Guilty as charged.

437
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,733
I'm actually a pretty
good musician. You
like country music?

438
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:48,968
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,168
- Well then, you might
recognize this face.

440
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,938
You might recognize
this shake. Huh?

441
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,338
- Mmm.

442
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,640
- I'm Troyal Brux.

443
00:17:54,642 --> 00:17:56,742
- Oh my God!

444
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,276
Oh. Sorry.
- Shh.

445
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,913
Okay, listen, this is of
utmost importance, all right?

446
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:03,148
Now, I'm here for
Nashville, one night,

447
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,349
one night only.

448
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,785
I wanna be treated
just like normal folk.

449
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:07,118
Just like I was
just a normal guy

450
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,021
that came in here
and booked a room.

451
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,723
Travis Wiley. That's
why I go by that name.

452
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,190
That's, that's what's
called an alias.

453
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,458
- Of course.

454
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,261
We'll take real good
fuckin' care of you.

455
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,699
- You are a live one.

456
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:20,933
- Bullseye!

457
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,434
- But no, I, I do
appreciate that.

458
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,003
And that's why I like to
stay at this nice hotel.

459
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:25,504
This is a, this is a
real nice establishment,

460
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,073
and uh, you guys
are all real nice.

461
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:27,907
You treat me real well.

462
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:29,041
- Here's your key card.

463
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,310
It's room 1615,

464
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:35,113
and if there's anything
you need, you let me know.

465
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,147
- You bet I will.

466
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,817
- Enjoy your stay!

467
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,051
- Thank you.

468
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:45,457
Oh, hey, well there he is.

469
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:47,893
Head honcho, you're the
big man of security, huh?

470
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:48,894
- Hm. That's me.

471
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:49,962
- You wanna walk me to my room?

472
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,463
- Sure.

473
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,732
Now, I don't know if they
talked to you downstairs

474
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,299
about who I am or what
I'm doing here today.

475
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,801
- Oh man, I know who you are.

476
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:58,269
- Oh yeah? I didn't picture
you to be a country music fan.

477
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,305
- I mean,
I wouldn't say that.

478
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,008
We went to Stillwater together.

479
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,343
From '82 to '85.

480
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,344
- You went to Stillwater
from '82 to '85?

481
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,614
- Yes, sir. Played football.

482
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,448
- Small world. I mean,

483
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,118
what was the number
on your jersey?

484
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,952
- 31.

485
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:15,855
- 31. Well.

486
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:16,689
Was a good team those years.

487
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:17,623
- Yeah.

488
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,356
- Same year as I went, y'know?

489
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,190
- Yeah.

490
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,392
Yeah.

491
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:21,560
- Well, what you doin'
here in Nashville?

492
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,395
- Man, just workin' in a hotel.

493
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:25,965
- That's as good a living
as any, I guess.

494
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,500
- You played the guitar?

495
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:28,701
- Yeah, I'd say it worked out
pretty well for me, too, huh?

496
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:30,670
What do you think?

497
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:31,971
- What can I help
you with tonight?

498
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,739
- Well, as you know,

499
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:36,374
I'm stayin' in this
room right here tonight.

500
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,145
Now, paparazzi catches wind
to this or some crazy fans

501
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,713
and it's gonna be hard for
a fellow to get some sleep,

502
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:41,547
you know what I'm saying?

503
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:42,748
- Sure.

504
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,050
- Now I need you to keep
an extra special eye

505
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:46,018
on this door right here.

506
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,852
Can you do that for me?

507
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,087
- Yes, sir.

508
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:49,254
I got you covered.

509
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,488
I'll guard it with my life.

510
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,558
- Stillwater
alumni. That's,

511
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:56,896
that's really somethin'.

512
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:57,730
- All right.

513
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,000
- 'Preciate it.

514
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,431
- It's George.

515
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,167
Leave a message.

516
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:36,102
- Hey, George.

517
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:37,368
It's, uh, it's Troyal.

518
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,871
I just, just got
here in Nashville.

519
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:40,271
I'm at the Himbassy Suite,

520
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,674
or the Embassy Suites.

521
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:43,341
Almost said Hilton.

522
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,343
Uh, it's, it's pretty cool, man.

523
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,612
It's kind of themed out.

524
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:48,781
They got, uh, old
concert posters.

525
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,315
They got a Waylon Jennings.

526
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,785
I'm looking at a, a Johnny
Cash poster over there.

527
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:54,220
I bet there's a,

528
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,888
bet there's a George
Jones poster somewhere.

529
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,624
I just, uh, haven't really
done much investigating as I,

530
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,726
as I said, I just got,
just got into town,

531
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:04,565
so, um, I guess you could
give me a call back.

532
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,968
Uh, you could call,
er, let me see.

533
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,737
I don't, I don't have a
number here, but I can,

534
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:13,973
well, let me, how can I do this?

535
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:17,777
I'll put the phone
down or, hold on.

536
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:26,619
All right. It's, uh, 1615,
that's the room number.

537
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,087
So, uh, 1615,

538
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:31,090
you call the front desk
at the, uh, Embassy Suites

539
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:33,726
and that's, uh, they'll
get you to 1615.

540
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:36,394
That'll be the,
that's my room number.

541
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,863
Uh...

542
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:39,865
Tell you what I'm gettin'
pretty, pretty inspired here.

543
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:42,501
This is, uh, this,
it's really something.

544
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:43,803
- Damn,

545
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,771
cocksuckin'...
- Hello?

546
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:46,739
- Clint?

547
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,007
- Yeah. This, this is Troyal.

548
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,775
- Meet me at
the Paddock Club in 15.

549
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,309
- Ha, I, yes, sir. Yep.

550
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,778
I'll, I, I can be there,
I can be there real quick.

551
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,979
I'll be there, just gotta...

552
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,616
Uh, hello?

553
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,119
Hello?

554
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:00,351
All right.

555
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,054
There he is.

556
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,556
Hey, I'm, it's me, Troyal.

557
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:05,991
Nah, he knows, he's
gonna meet me there.

558
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,493
Uh, say, don't you owe
me a couple of bucks?

559
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,763
Or, say, say, don't
you owe me a five-spot?

560
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:12,798
Or a cool, a cool spot? Or.

561
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,099
Stupid.

562
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:14,967
Hey, good-lookin'!

563
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:15,935
No, that's,

564
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:17,402
that's queer.

565
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,871
Hey, did, didn't I read about
you in the funny pa, yeah.

566
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:23,277
Hey, didn't I read about you
in the funny papers? All right.

567
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,427
- Here you are, sir.

568
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:42,597
- Thank you.

569
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,677
- Mr. Jones.

570
00:22:57,912 --> 00:22:58,946
- Mmm. Howdy.

571
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,381
Have a seat.

572
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:06,719
How was your flight?

573
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:08,386
- Well, I'll let you
be the judge of that

574
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,023
when I tell you I
flew private, so...

575
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:13,359
- That's nice.

576
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:17,529
I hadn't left East Texas for
several years 'til last week,

577
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,665
and kind of forgotten
how nice it was.

578
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,167
- Well, I count my blessings
every day for my success.

579
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,002
- Do ya?

580
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:24,169
- Yeah, of course.

581
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,905
- Yeah, that's
right. Good ol' boy.

582
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:28,140
That's what you're
into, isn't it?

583
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:30,943
- Uh, yes, sir. I'm just a
Oklahoma boy done good, y'know?

584
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,511
My state's proud of me,
I'm proud of myself.

585
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:34,313
And my success is,

586
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:35,881
of course, you gotta
understand what that's like.

587
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,383
I mean, you gotta be
proud of yourself.

588
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:42,390
- Oh, I don't know that pride
has very much to do with it.

589
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,489
I've lived a long life, son.

590
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:47,226
There's been a lot
of ebb and flow.

591
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:50,129
I don't have too much pride
in my own accomplishments.

592
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:54,300
It's, I find I have pride in
other people's accomplishments.

593
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:58,304
You know, like, like you or
somethin', and not myself.

594
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,572
- I gotta say, Mr. Jones,
it's sittin' across from you,

595
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:03,575
you know, a country
legend like you, and,

596
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:04,777
it's pretty surreal.

597
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,845
Then you telling me
that you're proud of me,

598
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,280
that makes me feel really good.

599
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:11,016
- No. No, no, no.

600
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:13,652
I was just using
you as an example

601
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:16,889
in the sentence of
something to be proud of

602
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:18,223
that was not myself.

603
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,893
No. I don't know
if I could be proud

604
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,428
of your accomplishments anyway.

605
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,265
They're a little bit too much
like my own accomplishments.

606
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,867
Now, that'd be kinda like
arrogance, wouldn't it?

607
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,803
And, uh, that's not
very good ol' boy.

608
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:32,071
You get what I'm sayin'?

609
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:33,439
- Yeah, I think I smell
what you're stepping in.

610
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,874
- Yeah. I, I'm hungry.

611
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,076
Wanna go ahead and order?

612
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:37,910
- Sure.

613
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:39,211
- Waiter.

614
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,746
Let's skip the appetizers

615
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,348
and go straight to the main
course, that okay with you?

616
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,249
- Hey, it's your world,
man. I'm just livin' in it.

617
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:46,352
I'm gonna have whatever
Mr. Jones is havin'.

618
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:48,554
- I want the filet. Rare.

619
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:49,588
Baked potato.

620
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,756
- Yes, sir.

621
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:52,191
- And I'd like to amend
my last statement.

622
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,126
I would like exactly
what Mr. Jones is havin',

623
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:56,595
except for I'd like my
steak cooked well-done.

624
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,998
- Hmm. You really are
from Oklahoma, aren't you?

625
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,835
- I believe I am. Yeah.

626
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,137
- Well-done, huh?

627
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,373
- Yes sir, I like the
cow, uh, good and dead.

628
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,675
- You're
really into this

629
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:12,011
good ol' boy act, aren't you?

630
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,979
- Well, I mean, you put a
nice steak in front of me

631
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:15,447
or a chicken-fried steak,

632
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:16,715
I'm gonna go with the
chicken-fried every time.

633
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:17,983
That's just, that's
just how I roll.

634
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:20,719
- Yeah, but you cook the
flavor right out of it.

635
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:21,954
- I, I don't like the blood.

636
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,689
- The blood's where
the flavor is, son.

637
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:26,592
You know, you've
insulted the chef, right?

638
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:27,826
- How'd I do that?

639
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,129
- I mean, a chef will
cook a well-done steak,

640
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:32,466
but they do so begrudgingly.

641
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,067
And, see,

642
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:38,070
the chef will pull the
order for a well-done steak

643
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:41,508
and balk at it with the
rest of the kitchen staff.

644
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,176
At first, they'll, they'll
be angry as a mongoose,

645
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,846
but that'll turn to outright
mockery at the guest's expense.

646
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,381
And that means you, Troyal.

647
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,050
- Oh, damn.

648
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:53,919
- So they move that

649
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:56,822
soon-to-be-forsaken meat to
the hottest part of the grill,

650
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:59,224
trying to, you
know, push it along,

651
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,660
cursing all the while.

652
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:02,995
Then, it becomes a race

653
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:05,130
to see how many real
steaks they can cook

654
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:07,900
in the ungodly amount
of time it takes to cook

655
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:11,103
that one bastard child.

656
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,805
- Well, how long does it
take to cook your steak?

657
00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:14,940
- Eh, two, maybe three minutes.

658
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,676
- Oh, yeah. Damn.
I, I can't do that.

659
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:20,479
- So just before
your steak is burned up

660
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:23,315
into a sick little lump of char,

661
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:27,386
mine will delicately and
ever so graciously emerge

662
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:29,588
as a culinary masterpiece.

663
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,592
Tender, juicy, and rich,

664
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:37,129
that, most of all, remains
in its God-given pure form.

665
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,099
- Why don't you just eat it raw?

666
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,868
- Well, a few minutes on the
grill is what separates us

667
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,104
from the animals.

668
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,307
- Well, I never thought about
it like that, Mr. Jones.

669
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:49,808
- Ah, well.

670
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,711
Oh, I'm sorry. There's the
wine, have yourself a pour.

671
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:55,047
- Don't mind if I do.

672
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:57,249
- It's a seven-year-old P & V.

673
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:00,087
It's pourin' pretty
good right now.

674
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:03,891
- Mm.

675
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,727
Yeah, that's, that's nice.
That's real interesting.

676
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,662
You know, I like to
drink. I drink a lot,

677
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:13,232
you know, beer or whiskey
or wine, you know,

678
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:14,900
whatever you put
in front of me, I,

679
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,268
some would say I have a problem.

680
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,638
Drinkin' problem, like
you, well, not like you.

681
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,707
Wait here, hold on.

682
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,709
I got something for you.

683
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,444
- Oh. What are you
gonna do next, boy?

684
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:27,212
Get down on one knee?

685
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,014
- No, these are,
these are cuff links.

686
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:32,084
They're belonged to
Hank Williams. Senior.

687
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:35,522
- Well, hell yes,
Hank Williams Senior.

688
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:36,357
Ah.

689
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:41,994
Son, maybe you, uh, maybe
you better hold onto those.

690
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:43,195
- No, I got 'em
for you, Mr. Jones.

691
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:45,297
- Oh, that's very thoughtful.

692
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,637
But I really, I really
can't accept 'em.

693
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:52,639
Listen. Listen, Troyal.

694
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:56,808
I know I was kind of vague
in my letter about my trip

695
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,546
and I'm sorry, but
I meant to do that.

696
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:02,014
It's just not somethin'
that I want broadcast.

697
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:03,516
- Well, you can
trust me, Mr. Jones.

698
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:06,718
You can, you can certainly
trust me with a secret.

699
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,492
- Well, uh, for starters, I'm
on the outs with Bev again.

700
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,560
- I'm sorry to hear that.

701
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:17,462
- That kind, patient,
life-savin' woman

702
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:19,634
has finally kicked me out.

703
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:25,773
And, uh, as far
as the trip goes,

704
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,941
you ever heard of cryonics?

705
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:30,242
- I don't think so.

706
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:33,145
- It has to do with the freezing

707
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,650
and storage of a human corpse.

708
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:39,117
The idea is that resurrection

709
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,121
might be scientifically
possible at some later date.

710
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:44,056
- Like Walt Disney.

711
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:46,260
- Exactly like Walt Disney.

712
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:48,961
Troyal,

713
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:49,797
I'm sick.

714
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:52,764
It's my heart.

715
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,199
- I didn't know that.

716
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,834
- Yeah, some days it's okay.

717
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:59,006
And then, other days
it's not so good.

718
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:03,643
- So you're thinking
about getting frozen?

719
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:07,145
- I've done all the thinkin'.
I'm goin' in tomorrow morning.

720
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,780
- Well, what if
somethin' goes wrong?

721
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,215
What if you die?

722
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:12,884
- Everything's a risk, ain't it?

723
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:16,558
I mean, I'm just tired
of living on my past.

724
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:20,025
On my last night on Earth,

725
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:23,563
I wanted to see what
the future looks like.

726
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:27,968
And, for better or worse,
I believe that that is you.

727
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:32,437
- So you're sayin', it's your
last night on planet Earth,

728
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,540
and you wanna spend it with me?

729
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,744
- Well, I hadn't actually
put a lot of thought into it,

730
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:38,580
but yeah.

731
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:41,179
- Well, God dog.

732
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:43,048
That's wild, man. Cheers!

733
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,324
- Rare.

734
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:53,127
And very well-done.

735
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,128
- Uh, listen, real, real quick,

736
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,096
I just wanna say
I'm really sorry.

737
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:59,431
I did not mean to disrespect you

738
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:02,602
by asking for a well-done steak.

739
00:30:02,604 --> 00:30:04,936
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

740
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:14,946
♪ Sodom and Gomorrah
wouldn't seem so bad ♪

741
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:17,717
♪ Debbie, you know, I'm tryin' ♪

742
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:22,921
- Hey, P-Wee, slow
night tonight?

743
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,289
- Seems to be the case.

744
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:26,726
- I was hopin' it would
be. How are you, friend?

745
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:28,427
- Doin' good, thank you.

746
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:30,062
- Got a buddy with me tonight.

747
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:32,132
You recognize him at all?

748
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,833
- I can't say that I do.

749
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,436
- Take that.

750
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:38,837
That's what I like
about you, P-Wee.

751
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,939
You're a classic and
you always will be.

752
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:43,745
- Only way God
made me, thank you.

753
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:47,279
- Well, god damn.

754
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:49,481
I thought I'd see you here.

755
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:50,817
- George.

756
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:51,651
How are ya?

757
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,753
- I'm fairly well.

758
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,822
- Didn't I read about
you in the funny papers?

759
00:30:55,824 --> 00:31:00,729
- Troyal, I
want you to meet Juno.

760
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,832
Juno is a very
talented individual.

761
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,865
- You a musician?

762
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,501
- Hell, Troyal, it's Nashville.

763
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:11,336
Everybody down
here's a musician.

764
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:15,006
No, Juno's not much
of a piano player.

765
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:19,645
But he does have other talents
that prove to be very useful.

766
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:22,147
Won't you join us at our table?

767
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,584
- I'm ready to go
back to the hotel.

768
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:26,952
- But this is
where the country stars

769
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:29,622
come to write their
drinking songs.

770
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,490
- I don't see any country stars.

771
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:34,794
All I see are a
bunch of lowlifes.

772
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:36,495
I'm gonna go and start the car.

773
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:38,831
- No, just
give it a few minutes.

774
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,132
Have another beer.

775
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:41,667
- I don't want another beer.

776
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,836
I want to be clearheaded.

777
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:47,472
- Well then, go get some
pretzels at the bar. Whatever.

778
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:49,709
Let's stay a few minutes.

779
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:53,579
- Man, it is a bad place to
work for a recovering alcoholic.

780
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:56,114
I will tell you that much.

781
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:59,552
- They tell me that my
ass was coverin' the drain

782
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,319
so no water would go down it.

783
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:03,088
I was just lucky
that the suction

784
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,492
from the drain didn't gut me.

785
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:09,762
I was luckier still that
my road manager found me

786
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:12,964
just as I was gettin'
ready to turn blue.

787
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,767
- So, so you missed the show?

788
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:18,069
- I sure did. And I felt
really bad about it.

789
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:21,574
Back in those days, people
would drive hundreds of miles

790
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:24,943
from these little farm towns
to come see the, the shows,

791
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:28,246
and, and I'd do some
stupid shit like that.

792
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:31,983
The promoter had to give
'em, uh, a, a voucher?

793
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:33,755
For some future show.

794
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:40,227
I don't know, but the fans
still had faith in me, though.

795
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:44,129
Even to this day, I
don't understand why.

796
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,598
You know, I,

797
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,938
I would apologize to every
single one of them if I could.

798
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,372
I was a mess back
in those days. Heh!

799
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:56,642
- Well, shoot, I'm just,
I'm glad you're still alive.

800
00:32:56,644 --> 00:33:01,549
- Well, it's not from lack
of trying to not be.

801
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:05,118
You know, I won all the awards.

802
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:08,186
I'm not braggin'.

803
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:10,222
I won 'em. I know
you won a bunch, too.

804
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:11,456
But a lot of those are ones

805
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,960
that just got made up
in the last year or two.

806
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:17,697
And that's just, like, the
Country Music Association,

807
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:19,164
television, whatever.

808
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,098
George Strait.

809
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,467
Straight! My ass!

810
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:24,837
Anyways, it's easier
to win an award

811
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,405
that just got made
up in the last year.

812
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,274
'Cause you just have to
show 'em somethin' new.

813
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:30,845
I mean, no offense,

814
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:34,312
it's like country
music dressin' up.

815
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,014
Or dressin' down, maybe.

816
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,618
Tryin' to be something that
it ain't and never will be.

817
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,652
Rock and roll.

818
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,789
- I like CCR.

819
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,958
- Now see there's a, CCR.
That's, that's a good band.

820
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,459
- Well, see?

821
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:51,096
Now, that there is the reason
that I don't got no friends!

822
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:52,598
That's just the way I like it.

823
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,901
'Cause I'd just turn around
and stab a knife in your back

824
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:56,903
some time when you
weren't lookin'.

825
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:58,838
Ain't that right, Juno?

826
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,205
- That's right, George.

827
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,943
- You son of a bitch.

828
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,944
But I like it like that.

829
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:09,147
You know, there's, there's
true things that are terrible

830
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:13,351
and there are terrible
things that are true.

831
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:16,024
I, I'mma tell you another story.

832
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,558
This is a true story

833
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,227
and I have never told a
living soul about this.

834
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,429
It was about one time

835
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:28,199
when I was in a tight
spot with the mob.

836
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:29,969
I was up in New York City,

837
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:33,639
which was probably my
first mistake.

838
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,206
- I don't know how
to describe this guy.

839
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:39,379
He's either a spic, Rican,
wetback, ahh, Spaniard.

840
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,914
He's a Mexican.

841
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:45,051
- Well, what, what does this,
uh, Mexican do for a livin'?

842
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:50,058
- He
sells drugs to children

843
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:54,292
and their mothers, his
own fuckin' neighborhood.

844
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:56,729
And with them, it's always,
he wants to kill this.

845
00:34:56,731 --> 00:34:59,565
He wants to do that.
Whores up the kazoo.

846
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,633
- We need to put some poison

847
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:02,367
down this motherfucker's throat.

848
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,869
- That's right. That's right.

849
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,538
- Uh, alright.

850
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,545
Uh, but uh, what's
this got to do with me?

851
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,746
I mean, uh, uh, what do
you want me to do about it?

852
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,514
- We think you can help us.

853
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:18,851
- Now, look, you owe us
quite a bit of money.

854
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:20,653
Hey, Marty, how much is it?

855
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:22,722
- 30 big one. That's
lots of money.

856
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:24,090
What the...

857
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:25,992
- 30,000 dollars?

858
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:27,158
- I know.

859
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,361
I think we're crossin'
some lines here.

860
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,099
I'm a country singer.

861
00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:36,136
I'm not a, uh, whatever
it is you think I am.

862
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:40,906
- You're nothin' but
a damn degenerate.

863
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:45,479
- Okay. But I am not a killer.

864
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:49,982
- Yeah? What'd you do
in, uh, Korea? KP duty?

865
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,719
- What's it gonna be?

866
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:59,457
- They had me by the balls.

867
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:02,995
I didn't have anyone
I could turn to.

868
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:06,766
Not to mention I was
dead broke at the time.

869
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:08,868
- So you
went through with it?

870
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,003
- What choice did I have?

871
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:12,972
- You killed a man.

872
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:15,741
- I'm not saying
I'm proud of it,

873
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:19,377
but it was him or me,
so, yeah, I done it.

874
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:22,247
I snuck in there when he was
making it with his woman.

875
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:58,918
- Sounds like somethin' that'd
be hard to keep to yourself.

876
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,087
Somethin' that would
eat you up inside.

877
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:04,422
- You work it out with
your music, with your art.

878
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:06,926
That's how you blow
the dust off your soul

879
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:09,461
when the world crashes
in on top of you

880
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:11,699
and tries to bury your ass.

881
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,303
That's how you crazy glue
the pieces back together

882
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:19,739
after somebody's
ripped your heart out

883
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,707
and stomped all over it.

884
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,274
It's why God

885
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:24,612
made us artists.

886
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:31,485
Everyone. It doesn't matter
if you are number one,

887
00:37:32,587 --> 00:37:35,721
or number one million in one.

888
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:37,625
Everybody is an artist.

889
00:37:39,694 --> 00:37:40,962
I believe that.

890
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,829
Everybody is an artist.

891
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:46,565
- My wife sings in the
choir every Sunday.

892
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,134
- Well, mine too.

893
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:49,367
- I believe in Him.

894
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,301
- Everybody
is an artist.

895
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,103
- I do too. What's your point?

896
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:52,337
- I would like brandy.

897
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:53,572
- Everybody
is an artist.

898
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:56,742
- And he will have
a glass of beer.

899
00:37:56,744 --> 00:38:00,646
- Everybody
is an artist.

900
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:02,515
- It's showtime, motherfuckers.

901
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:11,991
- What about
me? Am I an artist?

902
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:14,093
- Oh, you are an artist.

903
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:17,229
I'm sure as shit you're an
artist. You're the most...

904
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:48,561
- You know, Connie
here, she's a singer.

905
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:50,062
Maybe y'all can do
a duet together.

906
00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:51,197
- Oh, you're a singer?

907
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,698
- Yeah. Been
singing all my life,

908
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,800
but ain't nobody found me yet.

909
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:57,236
- So it, it's Connie. And...

910
00:38:57,238 --> 00:38:58,537
- Donna.
- Donna.

911
00:38:58,539 --> 00:38:59,839
- And that is Sueleen.

912
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,507
Sign of the times.

913
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:02,608
- Howdy, y'all.

914
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,342
- Matched trio.

915
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:07,880
Thank the Lord for
numerical coincidences.

916
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:09,849
- Troyal, you gonna
sing us a song tonight?

917
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:12,885
- Uh, hadn't planned on it,
but how 'bout a autograph?

918
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,653
I could do, I could do
an autograph for you.

919
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:15,554
- I think
I'd like that.

920
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,023
- It's like
my daddy taught me.

921
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,291
The world will not
let you scream,

922
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:22,094
so you better learn to sing.

923
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,461
- That's beautiful.

924
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:25,731
- And he underlined
the point by making me

925
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:28,567
sing on command or he'd
beat the shit outta me.

926
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:30,936
- Oh, you poor baby.

927
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:32,238
Did he beat you horrible?

928
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,373
- Oh, Miss Donna?
He beat me horrible.

929
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,308
- Oh.

930
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,375
- Oh, I'll, I'll pass on that.

931
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,811
I'll go ahead and, just...

932
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:40,079
- Come on, Troyal.

933
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:41,347
We're tryin' to have
a celebration here.

934
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:43,448
- Yeah, come on.
Don't be a sourpuss.

935
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,683
- Oh, no, no, no, see,

936
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,185
I don't, I don't, uh,
I don't mess with this.

937
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:48,587
This isn't one of my favorite.
This is, like a light beer?

938
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:50,890
Like, I can do light beer.
I can drink plenty of those.

939
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:53,325
- Now, I have
seen you up on stage,

940
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:56,362
grinnin' like an
Oklahoma jackpot.

941
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:26,961
- Ugh! Come on, Juno!

942
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:29,094
You're gonna act like a fool,

943
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,196
people are gonna
treat you like a fool.

944
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:32,598
You got this.

945
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:36,304
Let's go.

946
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:58,657
- Mmm.

947
00:40:58,659 --> 00:40:59,427
Beans.

948
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:01,494
All right.

949
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh.

950
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:11,837
Beans, two nights in a row.
Hey, that ain't bad, huh, Ma?

951
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,106
Uh, let's get you a scoop here,

952
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:16,775
and a scoop for me over here.
- You bet.

953
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,010
- Hey, Ma, guess what?

954
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:19,845
I went to P-Wee's old
place right after work.

955
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:21,513
Ran into Trey.

956
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:23,415
We get to playing
a round o' pool

957
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,317
and get to talkin'
about the Memphis game.

958
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,119
About halfway through the
conversation, I realize,

959
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:29,655
wait a minute, Trey
doesn't own a TV.

960
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,657
That's when he tells me
that he installed an antenna

961
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,158
on his roof last week.

962
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,827
I told him about your situation.

963
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:36,595
Trey is volunteering
to install the antenna

964
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:38,330
on your roof next week.

965
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,565
How does that sound?

966
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:42,935
- Sounds great, but
I've already got Jack.

967
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:45,204
- Who's Jack?

968
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:48,207
- Jack Kennedy. He does
a sound booth at church.

969
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:49,842
You know Jack Kennedy.

970
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:50,909
- Oh, the sound guy.

971
00:41:50,911 --> 00:41:52,378
Yeah, he's a good man.

972
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,245
He's gonna come by?

973
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:54,513
- Mm-hmm.

974
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:55,481
- Well, wh, what day,
I gotta tell Trey this.

975
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:56,715
- He'll have to come on a Sunday

976
00:41:56,717 --> 00:41:59,618
because he works
the other six days.

977
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,819
- Just let me know
when he comes by, okay?

978
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:02,121
I wanna be here for that.

979
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:03,589
- Okay.

980
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:05,524
- I know how you get, you
wanna be very helpful.

981
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:08,527
You want to help out and you
end up straining something.

982
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:11,330
So, let me be that person to
strain something, all right?

983
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:13,032
- You'll just be in the way.

984
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:15,034
- I understand that. I just
wanna help you, all right?

985
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:17,036
I just wanna help you.

986
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,270
- You'll
be in the way.

987
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:19,471
- End o' discussion. I
just wanna help ya, Ma.

988
00:42:19,473 --> 00:42:21,940
- He's full up. He's got enough.

989
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:23,642
- I just want to
help ya. That's it.

990
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:24,877
That's all. I just
want to help you.

991
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:27,212
- You'll be in the way.

992
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,314
You understand?
You'll be in the way.

993
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:31,817
- I would be in the
way, wouldn't I?

994
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:32,653
I always

995
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:35,888
seem to be in the way.

996
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,089
- I'm...
- Sorry, you'll be in the way.

997
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:37,956
- I'm always in
the way, aren't I?

998
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,761
- Takes all kind
to make the world, I guess.

999
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:46,834
- You'll have to
excuse me for a minute.

1000
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,003
- Now, what's the
chance of those two,

1001
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:53,540
havin' a drink, bein'
together in this bar?

1002
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,774
- That's the whole
point, knucklehead.

1003
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:58,610
They come here for this
reason. All, all the stars.

1004
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:00,347
- Well, it ain't them.

1005
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:04,583
- I'm gonna go get a picture..

1006
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:06,485
- God damn it, Ethel,
you're gonna embarrass me.

1007
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:08,087
Sit your ass down.

1008
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,338
- But you know
who those boys idolize?

1009
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,674
- Dad's home!

1010
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:30,579
- Their father.

1011
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:40,819
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1012
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:43,922
I didn't realize there
was someone else in here.

1013
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:47,928
- Anyone can be in here
as far as I'm concerned.

1014
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:49,930
It's 1994.

1015
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,871
And you know what that means?

1016
00:43:58,873 --> 00:43:59,874
In six years,

1017
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:05,477
all these noisy machines
are gonna shut down,

1018
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,714
and all of this

1019
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,217
is gonna cease to exist.

1020
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:15,624
- Okay?

1021
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:18,824
- What's the matter?

1022
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:20,094
You seem upset.

1023
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,264
- I'm not upset.

1024
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:26,367
- You say so.

1025
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:32,840
You need to trust that
home is what you make it.

1026
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:37,142
And you can be anyone
you want to be,

1027
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:38,547
this time around.

1028
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,898
- Troyal, Troyal, Troyal.

1029
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,471
What would you say to a night
with a real country girl?

1030
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:42,474
- I'm married.

1031
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:44,109
- Of course.

1032
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:48,048
All the best ones are.

1033
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,354
- You mind if I use the phone?

1034
00:45:54,723 --> 00:45:57,756
- Is it gonna be a local call?

1035
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:01,493
- Actually no, I'm
callin' home. Here.

1036
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:04,265
I'll give you $10.
How'd that be?

1037
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,767
- Been a lot of counterfeitin'
going on around here.

1038
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,871
Looks legitimate, though.

1039
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:13,874
I'll give you a minute.

1040
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:16,578
- Thank you.

1041
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:21,750
How you doin'?

1042
00:46:56,216 --> 00:47:00,085
- I feel like
we're losin' you.

1043
00:47:03,692 --> 00:47:04,524
- Thanks.

1044
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,593
- Certainly, certainly.

1045
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,863
- Share and share alike.

1046
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:16,234
- Hey, ladies, get
that over here.

1047
00:47:16,236 --> 00:47:17,402
- Oh, yeah?

1048
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,640
- Oh, we're gonna
have a party now.

1049
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:22,107
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

1050
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:27,647
- Ooh!

1051
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:35,120
- Oh, no, no, ma'am, ma'am.

1052
00:47:35,122 --> 00:47:37,189
No, you, you, you can't,
you can't have a picture.

1053
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:38,323
- Well, well, it's my camera.

1054
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:39,559
- Just hold on a minute, sonny.

1055
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:40,793
- I can take all
the photos I want.

1056
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:41,728
- You're gonna have to
give me that camera.

1057
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,161
- Oh no, I will not, I can...

1058
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:44,429
- Here, let, I'm gonna
give you, I got some money.

1059
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:45,765
I will give.
- It's not for sale.

1060
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:46,998
- I'll give you 300 dollars.

1061
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,534
- It's worth a lot
more than that.

1062
00:47:48,536 --> 00:47:50,435
- Bud. Why don't you pick
on somebody your own size.

1063
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:52,805
- Those pictures, are
personal property of ours.

1064
00:47:52,807 --> 00:47:54,574
- Okay, this is just a
big misunderstanding.

1065
00:47:54,576 --> 00:47:55,742
And they just happen
to have something that

1066
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:56,975
doesn't belong to them.
- Listen.

1067
00:47:56,977 --> 00:47:58,243
- I don't know who you
guys think you are,

1068
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:00,780
with your loud shirts
and your loud talk

1069
00:48:00,782 --> 00:48:04,282
and all the drug use,
but this is my bar.

1070
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:07,185
I own this bar. And
you ain't Nashville.

1071
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:08,621
- P-Wee, hang on now.

1072
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:10,523
We're, we're gonna
get this calmed down.

1073
00:48:10,525 --> 00:48:11,858
Just a misunderstanding.

1074
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,425
- George, I love you,

1075
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:17,229
but you've been wearin' on
me for like 10 days straight.

1076
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,964
Ya ain't Nashville either, man.

1077
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:21,066
- Now, hold on, god damn it.
- God damn it, P-Wee,

1078
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:22,000
ya piece of shit.

1079
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:23,168
Fuck you, P-Wee.

1080
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,369
- Okay.

1081
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,571
- Okay, here's
what we're gonna do.

1082
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:26,238
I'm gonna go ahead
and take this.

1083
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,038
- Oh! No!

1084
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,273
Oh!

1085
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:29,509
- Ladies,
that is our cue.

1086
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:30,976
- I'm gonna go ahead
and give you this,

1087
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,144
and I want you all to
have a really nice night.

1088
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:33,078
- Oh.

1089
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,815
- Keep buying the records.

1090
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:37,315
- George.

1091
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:40,553
Don't come back for at least
a week. You understand?

1092
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:45,459
- Oo-wee!

1093
00:48:46,628 --> 00:48:48,193
- Not bad for an old guy, huh?

1094
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:50,328
- What, you mean to tell
me we ain't the same age?

1095
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:57,404
This night's just
nearly perfect.

1096
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,406
I bet you can hear the
coyotes howlin' out here, huh?

1097
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:04,978
- Yeah, there's more
scavengers every year.

1098
00:49:06,013 --> 00:49:09,183
- It's a damn beautiful
world, though.

1099
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:13,954
You sure you don't feel
like stickin' around?

1100
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,966
♪ Let me introduce to you ♪

1101
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:30,570
♪ A woman with a dream ♪

1102
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,973
- You're awful mopey tonight.

1103
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,643
- I was just thinkin', is all.

1104
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:38,746
- 'Bout what?

1105
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:43,381
- 'Bout somethin' I lost.

1106
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:44,552
Long time ago.

1107
00:49:46,955 --> 00:49:48,288
- I'm listenin'.

1108
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:54,627
- I was thinking about
life and, and time.

1109
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:57,028
And how weeks turn
into months and,

1110
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,497
and months turn into years.

1111
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,900
And before you know it, your,
your kids are all grown up

1112
00:50:00,902 --> 00:50:03,134
and, and you're old and wrinkly,

1113
00:50:03,136 --> 00:50:06,039
and everyone's
forgotten about you.

1114
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:13,378
I'm sorry I was impolite
at the bar earlier.

1115
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,380
I, I know I get like that
sometimes and I don't...

1116
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:16,849
- Oh, no.

1117
00:50:16,851 --> 00:50:18,751
Sorry if I was.

1118
00:50:18,753 --> 00:50:20,452
- I was just really lookin'
forward to this trip.

1119
00:50:20,454 --> 00:50:21,687
Y'know, I was really
lookin' forward

1120
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:24,089
to meeting my hero George Jones.

1121
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,090
Now that I've met him, I'll,

1122
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:27,158
I'll never get to see him again.

1123
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,995
If all this cryogenics
talk is true,

1124
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:32,432
which I mean at this
point, who's to say?

1125
00:50:35,703 --> 00:50:37,202
Y'know, you can hear
it in his songs,

1126
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:39,539
but comin' face
to face with him.

1127
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:43,576
That's, that's when you
really realize that,

1128
00:50:43,578 --> 00:50:45,678
that he's in, in pain.

1129
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,282
- You do know that George
Jones is a piece of shit.

1130
00:50:50,284 --> 00:50:52,885
- Well, we're gonna have to
agree to disagree on that one.

1131
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:54,486
I think George
Jones is a genius.

1132
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:55,690
- Was a genius.

1133
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:00,158
Now he ain't nothin' but
a washed-up degenerate.

1134
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,395
Cryonics. Hell.

1135
00:51:02,797 --> 00:51:04,532
He ain't Walt Disney.

1136
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:11,571
And he ain't half the
songwriter you're gonna be.

1137
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:12,672
- I appreciate that, but...

1138
00:51:12,674 --> 00:51:14,507
- But nothing.

1139
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:17,743
Appreciate what you
got and shut up.

1140
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:20,414
Most people got nothin' like it.

1141
00:51:22,517 --> 00:51:26,588
You have no idea what all
you could have, do you?

1142
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:33,061
I can do things for you, Troyal.

1143
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:37,230
Things you couldn't
even dream of.

1144
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:45,940
Boo!

1145
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:58,118
- You all right, man?

1146
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:04,657
- Imagine seeing yourself
as a different self,

1147
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:06,892
living a different life,

1148
00:52:06,894 --> 00:52:08,961
but a life not so
different from your own.

1149
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:11,129
We're talking about
alternate dimensions here.

1150
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:14,366
You know, standing upon
the precipice of reality,

1151
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:18,606
gazing upon a horizonless
valley of infinite cells.

1152
00:52:20,108 --> 00:52:25,113
Each one with its own opinion,
thought, passion, desire.

1153
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:27,445
Y'know, once you're
able to glean

1154
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:29,749
on this notion of
alternate timelines,

1155
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,449
then you'll begin to
understand what it was like

1156
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:35,955
for Spock to be born and
raised in a Vulcan society.

1157
00:52:35,957 --> 00:52:38,423
But, to put a finer point on it,

1158
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:40,960
you finally understand
the leadership qualities

1159
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:45,131
that it takes to captain
a Starship Enterprise.

1160
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:48,868
Qualities like, uh, like
Captain Tiberius Kirk had,

1161
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,468
or Jean-Luc Picard.

1162
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:51,904
Shooting star.

1163
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:55,875
You know, captains who actually
had a Vulcan mind-meld.

1164
00:52:55,877 --> 00:52:57,375
- Sounds like a good show.

1165
00:52:57,377 --> 00:52:58,410
- Oh man, yeah.

1166
00:52:58,412 --> 00:52:59,645
And the Vulcan mind-meld?

1167
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:02,447
We're not just talking
about some fuckin', uh,

1168
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:03,883
Freaky Friday situation.

1169
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,351
We're talking about the
entire thing. Right?

1170
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,954
Head to toe, from the
beginning nerve end

1171
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:11,157
to the next, to the end.

1172
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,092
We're talkin' about, Deni.

1173
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:16,428
Oh my God, fuckin'
Denise, uh, Denise Crosby?

1174
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,397
The fact that she went
back to those studio execs

1175
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:22,535
and told her that she wanted
to reprise the role of, uh,

1176
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:25,303
Tasha, of, uh, fuckin' Tasha.

1177
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:28,607
Uh, fuckin', uh, Tasha Yar
on the Starship Enterprise.

1178
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:31,077
I mean, the fuckin'
balls on that woman.

1179
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,013
I mean, the fact that she
played a Romulan consort,

1180
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:36,414
but also played her
own fuckin' daughter?

1181
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:37,919
Fuckin' wild, man.

1182
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:46,291
- I'll bet you ladies are
licensed massage therapists.

1183
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:49,595
- Now, how
did you know that?

1184
00:53:49,597 --> 00:53:50,865
- Just a hunch.

1185
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:56,102
- Troyal, have you
ever had a massage?

1186
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:59,004
- Nah, I don't,
I don't think so.

1187
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:01,207
- It'll change
your life, brother.

1188
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:02,440
- Connie?

1189
00:54:02,442 --> 00:54:05,980
We should definitely
give Troyal a massage.

1190
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:09,447
- How 'bout it, Troyal?

1191
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:11,316
You want a massage?

1192
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:14,252
- You're a star,
son. You deserve it.

1193
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:15,888
Why don't you show these ladies

1194
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,357
your fancy Nashville
hotel suite?

1195
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:29,704
- Fuck it.

1196
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:25,157
- So, basically.

1197
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:26,892
Uh, Dr. Hammond,

1198
00:55:26,894 --> 00:55:31,429
uh, and he's cloning dinosaurs
on this island, right?

1199
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:34,233
- This one feels real nice,

1200
00:55:34,235 --> 00:55:36,569
but tight in the
neck and shoulders.

1201
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:37,937
- Dinosaurs.

1202
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:40,675
- This one skin's
all loose like,

1203
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:43,175
but his muscles?

1204
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:44,210
- But that's the
whole point of the movie.

1205
00:55:44,212 --> 00:55:45,811
- Sure are hard.

1206
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:48,614
- Like leather.

1207
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:49,449
- Nah.

1208
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,717
Like velvet.

1209
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,186
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah!

1210
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,055
The ones with all the
cute boys on the front.

1211
00:55:56,057 --> 00:55:57,923
- Oh yeah, who's cool now?

1212
00:55:57,925 --> 00:55:59,291
JTT?

1213
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:01,126
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know about JTT!

1214
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:02,360
You impressed?

1215
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:06,532
- This is it, isn't
it? The lap of luxury.

1216
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:07,465
- I mean, I guess
it's all right,

1217
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:08,968
if this is what you're into.

1218
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,670
- It's nights like this that
I am really going to miss

1219
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:14,008
when I am not in this world.

1220
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:20,348
- What happens if you get out
and everything's different?

1221
00:56:21,816 --> 00:56:24,116
- The skies could fall and
the rivers turn to blood,

1222
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:26,886
but there will always
be country music!

1223
00:56:26,888 --> 00:56:28,354
- Yeah, but,

1224
00:56:28,356 --> 00:56:30,421
what if, what if everybody
just forgot about you?

1225
00:56:30,423 --> 00:56:33,327
- No, nobody forgets
a true artist.

1226
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:39,064
They forget the, the
theatrics and the,

1227
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:41,235
the glitz and the glamour.

1228
00:56:42,637 --> 00:56:47,575
They forget the sizzle, but
they still hunger for the steak.

1229
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:52,880
And nobody cares about music
that's got no substance,

1230
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:55,147
songs without a soul.

1231
00:56:55,149 --> 00:56:56,949
- I know you ain't talkin'
'bout my music, Mr. Jones,

1232
00:56:56,951 --> 00:57:01,253
'cause top of the pops,
man, my shit is legit.

1233
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,989
- No, I wasn't
talkin' about you.

1234
00:57:03,991 --> 00:57:06,292
Although, I don't really know.

1235
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:08,861
I've never heard
any of your tunes.

1236
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,029
- Whattya mean, you ain't never
heard any of my tunes, man?

1237
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:11,597
I thought you were a fan!

1238
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,065
Shit, I've heard all your songs.

1239
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:17,069
- Ah, I just don't listen
to much music anymore.

1240
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:19,470
- That's just downright
disrespectful, man.

1241
00:57:19,472 --> 00:57:20,906
- Well.

1242
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:23,577
Why don't you sing me something?

1243
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,313
- Just right now, with no music?

1244
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,715
- No, there's no better time.

1245
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:30,885
I am all ears.

1246
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:37,291
- All right, I can

What the hell are you doin'?

1261
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:39,651
- What the fuck does it look
like I'm doin', peckerwood?

1262
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:41,120
- Okay. All right! That's it!

1263
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:42,121
- Baby, baby, you just sit back

1264
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:42,955
and let me take care of you.

1265
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:43,889
- No, no.

1266
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:45,090
Party's over. Everybody's out.

1267
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:46,558
Party's over!
- God damn it!

1268
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,193
- You need to lighten up!

1269
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:50,062
- You need to learn to relax.

1270
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:51,263
- No, honey, it's okay.

1271
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:53,532
No, I think it's plain as day.

1272
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,767
This one don't like women.

1273
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:57,136
Come on, girls.

1274
00:58:57,138 --> 00:59:00,172
- That's a bunch of bullshit.

1275
00:59:00,174 --> 00:59:02,608
- Fantastic. That, that
means you, come on, get up.

1276
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:05,644
- Oh, shit. George, listen,

1277
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:08,147
uh, we weren't
expecting any of this.

1278
00:59:08,149 --> 00:59:09,681
Uh,

1279
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:12,384
ya got any singles, fives,
uh, anything for cab fare?

1280
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,620
- I ain't got nothin'
but big bills.

1281
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:18,824
- God damn it! Is anything
gonna go right today?

1282
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:21,860
Well, I just don't
know what to do.

1283
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,764
- Here, take that. $20.

1284
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,865
- Troyal, you're a good man.

1285
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:28,100
I'm gonna get you back.

1286
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:29,435
- Nope, I don't need
to be gotten back.

1287
00:59:29,437 --> 00:59:30,702
Just, just leave.

1288
00:59:30,704 --> 00:59:31,570
- No. George will tell
you, I'm good for it.

1289
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:32,438
George, tell him.

1290
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,439
- Well, yeah.

1291
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:34,907
- Okay. Just go.

1292
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:36,275
- I think we're sayin' the
same thing is all I'm sayin'.

1293
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:37,810
George, take care.

1294
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:38,646
- Leave.

1295
00:59:43,484 --> 00:59:47,753
- Finally. I
thought they'd never leave.

1296
00:59:47,755 --> 00:59:50,691
- You just don't
get it, Mr. Jones.

1297
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:58,499
I mean, you're
like a hero to me.

1298
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,301
You invite me up
here to Nashville,

1299
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:04,169
to be my friend.

1300
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:06,105
I mean, that means
the world to me.

1301
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:07,206
You've been an
inspiration to me.

1302
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,708
You've been an
inspiration to everyone.

1303
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:12,945
But now I see you're,
you're just bullshit.

1304
01:00:12,947 --> 01:00:16,081
- I'm not bullshit.
You're bullshit.

1305
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:18,350
- At least I'm not a liar.

1306
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:21,053
- Your whole life is a lie.

1307
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:22,254
- How's my life a lie?

1308
01:00:22,256 --> 01:00:24,557
- You're lying to yourself.

1309
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,260
You're a god damn star and
you can do anything you want.

1310
01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:32,498
And you got yourself fenced
in this little tiny pod

1311
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,735
like some pussy-ass coward.

1312
01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:40,839
- I'm not a coward, Mr.
Jones. You know what I am?

1313
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:43,976
I'm a loyal, faithful,
good ol' boy.

1314
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:50,519
Big star. What's
that gotten you?

1315
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:53,087
It ain't enough!

1316
01:00:54,388 --> 01:00:56,023
- It's never enough.

1317
01:00:58,459 --> 01:01:00,261
It's never ever enough.

1318
01:01:03,632 --> 01:01:08,637
And who cares if it's
truth or lies?

1319
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:14,074
The truth is just a last
resort anyway.

1320
01:01:16,443 --> 01:01:19,579
It doesn't even
really exist anymore.

1321
01:01:19,581 --> 01:01:21,313
Not now, especially.

1322
01:01:21,315 --> 01:01:25,518
Just some bullshit story
somebody told once,

1323
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,122
and it doesn't even matter who.

1324
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:32,090
Does that offend
your sensibilities?

1325
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:34,895
Does that disrupt
your conscience?

1326
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,931
Me, I ain't got a conscience.

1327
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:43,003
I, I, I'm just a pipe for
fluids to pass through.

1328
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:48,675
You put your heart and
your soul into your music,

1329
01:01:48,677 --> 01:01:50,309
and, and, people just want to,

1330
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:53,912
they just want to gobble ya
up, they just want to eat it.

1331
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:56,815
They eat the shit outta
your godforsaken soul!

1332
01:01:56,817 --> 01:01:59,251
Everybody loves the music!

1333
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:02,788
And all the time they're just
tellin' you they're hungry.

1334
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:03,822
More! More!

1335
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:05,090
And they crowd around you.

1336
01:02:05,092 --> 01:02:06,758
And it's re, record
label people and,

1337
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,229
and, and journalists
and, and managers

1338
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:13,498
and this constant
stream o' women.

1339
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,069
And they're all sayin'
more, more, more!

1340
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:17,905
And, shit!

1341
01:02:19,106 --> 01:02:21,273
What, what kind of
a songwriter am I

1342
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:24,378
when I can't even
stand my own songs?

1343
01:02:25,779 --> 01:02:27,616
It's god damn torture!

1344
01:02:29,216 --> 01:02:32,518
I'd rather have a boilin'
case of hemorrhoids

1345
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,286
than write a song.

1346
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,130
I thought my music could
make people better.

1347
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:47,366
Nobody needs me anymore.

1348
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:52,371
After tomorrow, they have to
find somebody else to devour.

1349
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:56,808
And try to change people
but they, they changed me

1350
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,178
into their image.

1351
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:02,615
Ah!

1352
01:03:02,617 --> 01:03:05,219
The future used to be tomorrow,

1353
01:03:06,554 --> 01:03:09,555
and now it's today and,
and, nobody's ready.

1354
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:12,391
And no one wants
to know anything!

1355
01:03:12,393 --> 01:03:16,765
They just wanna, to, to feed
like hogs at the trough.

1356
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:20,065
- Why don't you just
get frozen then?

1357
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:21,800
Maybe you'll live
a hundred years.

1358
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:23,536
- Yeah, why not forever?

1359
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:26,373
I could be the
wandering minstrel!

1360
01:03:28,576 --> 01:03:31,243
What the hell do
you know, anyway?

1361
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:34,079
You, you gimme back those
Hank Williams cuff links.

1362
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:35,814
You don't deserve 'em

1363
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:37,550
I knew the man, god damn it,

1364
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:40,753
he'd be spinning in his
grave thinking of you.

1365
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:42,387
- Well, that's not really
that big of a dis, George.

1366
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,822
'Cause I got 'em for you anyway.

1367
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:46,427
- It is Mr. Jones to you.

1368
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:48,260
You don't get to
talk to me like that

1369
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:50,362
and then pretend
that you're my pal,

1370
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:51,198
my, my

1371
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:53,599
equal.

1372
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:57,369
That song you sang was
just damn terrible, boy.

1373
01:03:57,371 --> 01:04:00,405
- Well, first off, there was
no musical accompaniment.

1374
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:02,441
And secondly, I'm not
even finished writing it.

1375
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:05,112
- Well, don't bother. It's shit.

1376
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:08,080
- You take that back.

1377
01:04:08,082 --> 01:04:09,114
- Oh yeah?

1378
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:10,583
Fuck you.

1379
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:11,485
- Fuck you.

1380
01:04:13,087 --> 01:04:14,021
- Fuck you!

1381
01:04:15,222 --> 01:04:17,923
This is not how I wanted
to spend my last night.

1382
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:20,359
- You think this is how I
want to spend any night?

1383
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:23,161
- Now you're gonna tell
me I have to leave.

1384
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:25,598
- Well, yeah, I do think it'd
be a good idea if you left.

1385
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,367
- Just hang me out to
dry like everybody else.

1386
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:31,436
See if I care.

1387
01:04:31,438 --> 01:04:32,839
- Jesus.

1388
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:36,441
- You haven't learned
what it's like yet,

1389
01:04:36,443 --> 01:04:38,877
being up in that spotlight.

1390
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:43,750
You think they can see you,
but they can't really see you.

1391
01:04:43,752 --> 01:04:48,153
It's so cold up there, it's
like you're walking on the moon.

1392
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:52,023
- I mean, yeah, I
understand. It gets lonely.

1393
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:55,026
- Ah. After tomorrow,
you won't have to worry

1394
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:57,599
about seein' me around anymore.

1395
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:02,668
- What do you want
from me, Mr. Jones?

1396
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:03,738
- I envy you.

1397
01:05:04,873 --> 01:05:06,539
- You, oh, you envy me.

1398
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,875
- I gotta spell it out for you?

1399
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:10,108
- What do you mean you envy me?

1400
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,043
- You got everything
in front of you.

1401
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:13,880
You got your, your whole life,

1402
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:15,717
and your whole career,

1403
01:05:16,818 --> 01:05:19,284
and all these
opportunities to make

1404
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:22,688
great things for yourself
and I see you doin' it.

1405
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,057
And, and I wish it was me again,

1406
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:29,428
knowin' what I
know now.

1407
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:33,533
Make better choices
and not fuck things up.

1408
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:37,035
Put my head better on my
shoulders like I see you doin'.

1409
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:42,340
That's why I'm gonna
freeze myself tomorrow,

1410
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:46,278
'cause then hopefully
I can come back,

1411
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,080
and make a strong
finish in, you know,

1412
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:52,652
twenty or fifty
or a hundred years

1413
01:05:52,654 --> 01:05:57,659
when all the people that I've
harmed are dead or moved on.

1414
01:05:59,928 --> 01:06:02,095
That, and I need the rest.

1415
01:06:03,497 --> 01:06:07,533
- Look, look, George. You don't
need to get frozen for that.

1416
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:10,135
You just need to get therapy,
rehab, somethin', shit.

1417
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:11,804
Get clean, man. I'll pay for it.

1418
01:06:11,806 --> 01:06:14,439
- No, it's over for me.

1419
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:17,110
I'm just a tired, sick, old man.

1420
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:21,881
- It's not over for you.

1421
01:06:21,883 --> 01:06:24,015
It's not over for
anyone until it's over,

1422
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:25,854
and it ain't over yet.

1423
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:29,889
- Oh, God. Who's that?

1424
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:31,156
Are you expecting someone?

1425
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:32,324
- That's probably
your friend Juno.

1426
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:34,527
- I don't want to see him.

1427
01:06:34,529 --> 01:06:37,095
- I'll tell him to get lost.

1428
01:06:41,435 --> 01:06:43,435
- Evening, Mr. Brux.

1429
01:06:43,437 --> 01:06:44,937
- How are ya?

1430
01:06:44,939 --> 01:06:46,672
- How's that quiet
evening going for you?

1431
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:48,574
- Not as quiet as I'd hoped.

1432
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:51,644
- Hmm. People fighting in there?

1433
01:06:51,646 --> 01:06:54,714
- Had, had some people
over, but, you know,

1434
01:06:54,716 --> 01:06:56,849
they're, they're
not here anymore.

1435
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:58,918
- Just we've had some complaints
about some shouting, so...

1436
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,352
- Yeah, like I said, they're,

1437
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:03,255
they're long gone at this point,
so nothin' to worry about.

1438
01:07:03,257 --> 01:07:05,056
- How 'bout that old man
that came in after you?

1439
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:06,826
He seemed a little
messed up on the way in.

1440
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:09,294
- You know, we had some
beers out in the town,

1441
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:13,265
but that's perfectly legal
in the state of Nashville.

1442
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:14,767
From what I understand.

1443
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:15,701
I haven't read every law book.

1444
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:18,004
- Let me ask you somethin'.

1445
01:07:18,006 --> 01:07:22,875
You gonna break any more
shit in your hotel room?

1446
01:07:22,877 --> 01:07:23,943
- I'm really sorry about that.

1447
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:25,578
Here, let me,

1448
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:26,411
let me give you a
little somethin'.

1449
01:07:27,414 --> 01:07:28,280
No, no, no.

1450
01:07:28,282 --> 01:07:29,283
- It's fine.

1451
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:34,085
- You know, I never
really got your name.

1452
01:07:34,087 --> 01:07:37,723
- I imagine that comes
with the territory.

1453
01:07:37,725 --> 01:07:39,792
- I'd sure like to know it.

1454
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:44,362
- Let's just say I'm
somebody you used to know.

1455
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:47,200
You have a good
evening, Mr. Brux.

1456
01:08:04,786 --> 01:08:08,288
- You've been a good
friend to me, Troyal.

1457
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:15,029
- I believe every man
has a path to redemption.

1458
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:16,831
- Mm.

1459
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:21,132
Did I ever tell
you about that time

1460
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:24,137
I did undercover
work with the FBI?

1461
01:08:28,475 --> 01:08:30,743
- I don't think I
heard that one yet.

1462
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:40,352
- It's good. I can
hear everything.

1463
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:42,023
- All right, George.

1464
01:08:43,423 --> 01:08:45,591
Remember, if you feel
like you're in any danger,

1465
01:08:45,593 --> 01:08:47,760
you use the code word.

1466
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:49,327
You remember the
code word, right?

1467
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:50,663
- Of course.

1468
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:51,897
- I know this ain't easy,

1469
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:54,569
but you're doing it
for your country.

1470
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,571
It's the price of freedom.

1471
01:08:58,573 --> 01:09:00,673
- Let's get it over with
'fore I change my mind.

1472
01:09:00,675 --> 01:09:02,074
- Hm.

1473
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:06,378
- All right.
- All right.

1474
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:08,950
All right, let's rock and roll.

1475
01:09:16,724 --> 01:09:18,090
So, Mr. Jones,

1476
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:19,925
I cannot tell you
how pleased I am

1477
01:09:19,927 --> 01:09:22,394
that you've taken an
interest in our movement.

1478
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:24,362
Someone of your stature.

1479
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:26,666
Someone all of America
loves and respects,

1480
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:28,500
young and old alike!

1481
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:31,537
Oh, I want you to meet Luiz.

1482
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:32,772
Luiz, do you have a moment

1483
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,339
to meet a country
and western legend?

1484
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:35,708
- Oh, yes.

1485
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:36,876
- I thought so.

1486
01:09:36,878 --> 01:09:39,078
Mr. Jones, this is Luiz.

1487
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,546
- Mr. Jones,

1488
01:09:40,548 --> 01:09:42,148
I love the country music.

1489
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:43,683
Thank you for opening your heart

1490
01:09:43,685 --> 01:09:46,852
to the suffering of my people.

1491
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:48,355
- Thank you, Luiz.

1492
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:51,322
So, luckily, we were
able to get Luiz

1493
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:53,859
and most of his family
out of the country,

1494
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:57,063
but sadly, many of
his relatives remain.

1495
01:09:57,065 --> 01:09:58,998
The actions of
this administration

1496
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,934
contributing to violence over
there have been deplorable,

1497
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:03,736
to say the least.

1498
01:10:03,738 --> 01:10:05,838
It's a story that must be told.

1499
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,305
And hopefully with your help,

1500
01:10:07,307 --> 01:10:09,441
we can bring this
abomination to the attention

1501
01:10:09,443 --> 01:10:12,812
of the American people
and stop this madness.

1502
01:10:12,814 --> 01:10:14,345
That's where you come in.

1503
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:15,881
So, as most people know,

1504
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:20,485
our current president has a
certain cowboy sensibility.

1505
01:10:20,487 --> 01:10:22,121
I'm told that he
adores your music

1506
01:10:22,123 --> 01:10:24,322
and admires you very much.

1507
01:10:24,324 --> 01:10:26,926
Our sources tell us he would
very much enjoy meeting,

1508
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:29,528
as well as a photo op with you.

1509
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:32,865
And then, about a
week after that,

1510
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:36,736
we're hoping you
would make a statement

1511
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:38,369
against American-sanctioned
violence

1512
01:10:38,371 --> 01:10:40,840
throughout Latin America.

1513
01:10:40,842 --> 01:10:42,641
People would listen
to you, Mr. Jones,

1514
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:45,345
and you could help
turn the tide.

1515
01:10:47,314 --> 01:10:51,282
We most certainly believe
they would listen, Mr. Jones.

1516
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:54,385
Your influence is considerable.

1517
01:10:54,387 --> 01:10:56,254
Now, if you agree to this,

1518
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:58,657
we have a congressional
contact that could assist you

1519
01:10:58,659 --> 01:11:01,160
in getting a meeting
with President Reagan.

1520
01:11:01,162 --> 01:11:03,562
After you meet with him,
we would time the release

1521
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:06,264
of certain CIA documents
we've managed to obtain

1522
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:09,068
to the New York Times
and other press outlets.

1523
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,669
Now, we expect a certain
amount of public outcry

1524
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:12,571
in wake of these revelations.

1525
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:14,439
But with your prominent support,

1526
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:17,109
we could turn that
into a tidal wave

1527
01:11:17,111 --> 01:11:20,278
and very possibly move
the needle finally

1528
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,816
towards some sort of justice
for these dispossessed people

1529
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:27,922
and accountability for
these neofascist monsters.

1530
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:33,391
You'd be doing the world
a favor. Mr. Jones.

1531
01:11:33,393 --> 01:11:34,394
- Tree tops.

1532
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:37,598
- Tree tops.

1533
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,566
- Tree tops?

1534
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:41,399
- Tree tops.

1535
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:42,333
- Fuck!

1536
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,602
- Is that enough?

1537
01:11:43,604 --> 01:11:46,674
- I guess it's gonna
have to be. Let's go.

1538
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:51,309
All right, this is a
raid! Everybody down!

1539
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:07,893
- Is that a true
story, Mr. Jones?

1540
01:12:07,895 --> 01:12:09,329
- Call me George.

1541
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:13,628
It's time, son.

1542
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:43,324
- Hey, George.

1543
01:13:47,395 --> 01:13:51,196
I just wanted to say, I
still think you're a legend.

1544
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:52,064
- Thank you, Troyal.

1545
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:54,001
That means a lot to me.

1546
01:13:55,903 --> 01:13:58,837
You know, there's two ways

1547
01:13:58,839 --> 01:14:01,607
that you can secure your legacy.

1548
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:04,612
One is have yourself
frozen in time.

1549
01:14:07,014 --> 01:14:10,751
The other is to completely
reinvent yourself.

1550
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,487
Take care, son.

1551
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:24,398
- Let's go.

1552
01:16:15,976 --> 01:16:19,111
I don't know why I wandered
into this part of Texas, drunk.

1553
01:16:19,113 --> 01:16:21,682
When you took me in, pitied me,

1554
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:24,750
helped me to straighten out.

1555
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:25,686
Married me.

1556
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,455
Why?

1557
01:16:29,056 --> 01:16:30,724
Why did this happen?

1558
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,233
- Showtime, Champ.

1559
01:16:41,235 --> 01:16:44,603
- I'll in be there in a second.

1560
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:46,071
- You know, a man

1561
01:16:46,073 --> 01:16:48,907
always doing his best
becomes a natural leader,

1562
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:50,244
just by example.

1563
01:16:51,412 --> 01:16:53,412
- Is that another
Joe DiMaggio quote?

1564
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:55,614
- Yeah, that's old Joe.

1565
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:58,016
- Well, that's nice.

1566
01:16:58,018 --> 01:16:58,853
- Hey, um,

1567
01:17:00,955 --> 01:17:03,457
I'm real proud of you, Troyal.

1568
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,394
- I 'preciate it.

1569
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:13,732
- Now, I know we've had
the conversation before,

1570
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:17,102
but, uh, um, I thought I'd
bring it up one more time.

1571
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:21,039
It's, uh, it's about
these, these gold boots.

1572
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:22,941
- I told you before, I'm not
gonna wear those gold boots.

1573
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:24,476
They don't go with
my cowboy image.

1574
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:26,245
- Well, we did the
focus groups and they,

1575
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:27,713
they're still boots and...

1576
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:29,815
- Man, I don't care. I need
shit-kickin' boots, man.

1577
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:31,350
You're not gonna lead a
steer to a feed trough

1578
01:17:31,352 --> 01:17:33,018
wearin' gold boots,
looks stupid.

1579
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,588
- Well, I, I hear ya, um,

1580
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:39,424
but you, you know, John
Fogerty wore these boots.

1581
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:40,826
- John Fogerty of CCR?

1582
01:17:40,828 --> 01:17:41,662
- Mm-hmm.

1583
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:46,734
- Well, set 'em on the
counter on your way out.

1584
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:09,290
Son of a bitch!

1585
01:18:10,391 --> 01:18:11,225
Huh! Huh!

1586
01:18:12,293 --> 01:18:13,526
God damn superstar.

1587
01:18:20,134 --> 01:18:21,300
Showtime, motherfuckers.

1588
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:26,438
Well, Troyal,

1589
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,540
everything seems to be going

1590
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:29,808
pretty well in your world.

1591
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,477
You have the number one
record in America right now,

1592
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,114
a beautiful family, and what
looks to be a bun in the oven.

1593
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:37,916
- Well.

1594
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:40,185
God, He's smiled down on me.

1595
01:18:40,187 --> 01:18:43,255
He's, He's blessed me with
a wonderful, nurturing wife

1596
01:18:43,257 --> 01:18:44,990
and of course these
little fuckers.

1597
01:18:44,992 --> 01:18:48,360
- And we're just
really glad to have him home.

1598
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:49,194
- Well, you have managed

1599
01:18:49,196 --> 01:18:50,429
to do something

1600
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:52,331
that most artists can't
quite get a grasp on.

1601
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:55,734
You're keeping your music fresh.

1602
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:56,969
Now, one could say that

1603
01:18:56,971 --> 01:18:59,572
you are staying with
the times so much

1604
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:01,907
that you've become timeless.

1605
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,775
Now, someone as
content as yourself,

1606
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:05,444
how are you able
to keep your finger

1607
01:19:05,446 --> 01:19:07,879
on the pulse of what
the people want?

1608
01:19:07,881 --> 01:19:09,081
- Well, I think the,
the important thing to,

1609
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:11,984
is to stay relatable
in, in my music, y'know?

1610
01:19:11,986 --> 01:19:15,120
Make the material, uh, really
resonate with folks, uh,

1611
01:19:15,122 --> 01:19:17,422
of all, of all kinds of
different backgrounds.

1612
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:19,958
You know, I do that by
just understanding them,

1613
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,629
knowing who they are,
who, who everyone is.

1614
01:19:22,631 --> 01:19:24,930
- Oh! Wow! I just, I
just got goosebumps.

1615
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,666
- Right? Well, that's what I do.

1616
01:19:26,668 --> 01:19:27,634
You know, that's
what I do to people.

1617
01:19:27,636 --> 01:19:29,835
I, I create feelings in them

1618
01:19:29,837 --> 01:19:31,403
that they didn't
even know they had.

1619
01:19:31,405 --> 01:19:33,272
That's a rare
quality in a human.

1620
01:19:33,274 --> 01:19:34,507
These, these
goosebumps and these,

1621
01:19:34,509 --> 01:19:36,041
these feelings within
people, y'know,

1622
01:19:36,043 --> 01:19:37,843
Jesus doesn't judge,
I don't judge.

1623
01:19:37,845 --> 01:19:39,746
