00:44:20,382 --> 00:44:24,284
To hear beating of yours
heart and so good.

335
00:44:27,285 --> 00:44:30,186
He/she waits oh,

337

00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:43,093
What was wanted,

339
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:46,595
I don't know, I don't know how to explain.

340
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:15,703
- I have to go, I have to work.
- He/she waits one minute...

341
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:17,605
just only one more minute.

342
00:45:17,606 --> 00:45:21,507
I have to go, I am
late for the service, it loosens me.

343
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:45,915

345
00:45:49,718 --> 00:45:51,418

00:46:08,828 --> 00:46:11,228
Beautiful, they are both beautiful ones.

Do you know me?

367
00:48:51,988 --> 00:48:53,688
Would he/she owe?

368
00:48:54,589 --> 00:48:59,091
I wake up him this died,
I wake up and him this lives.

369
00:48:59,092 --> 00:49:02,693
Different things happen with me
the the whole hour, that I don't get to explain.

370
00:49:02,994 --> 00:49:05,394
Things that I did,

371
00:49:05,395 --> 00:49:10,697
People that speak to me, people that
they know me, but that I never knew.

372
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:12,698
- People like me?
- Yes.

373
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,100
- I think a little complicated.
- Nor tell me.

374
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:21,303
And on the lithium flask?

375
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:25,705
I don't know, that, that,
I don't know, it was in some besiege I don't know.

376
00:49:25,706 --> 00:49:28,807
Look! I don't get to explain, but
I thought that somebody was to try...

377
00:49:28,808 --> 00:49:31,008
- ... to try you do drug her?
- Uhum.

378
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,510
- Who, and because?
- I don't know, you tell me.

379
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:36,412
- It was not me who it wrote prescriptions.
- But his/her name this in the flask.

380
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:38,013
Why and what does think I came here?

381
00:49:38,114 --> 00:49:39,915
To receive some help.

382
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:43,917
Obviously you this to work
with some inconsistencies.

383
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:44,518
Oh yes...

384
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:47,320
I wake up each guile and I discover
that my husband died again.

385
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,622
That is going a little
haul of the inconsistency.

386
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:53,623
As and that he/she sits down...

387
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,926
During the moments
in what him this died?

388
00:50:00,227 --> 00:50:01,027
What?

389
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:04,829
I want to say, that type
of emoc.es, they go by itself.

390
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:08,931
And excuse, resentment, do I diminish?

391
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:10,033
What and what this to try to say?

392
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:14,535
And very common to dream during the day,
to imagine that people are dead.

393
00:50:14,536 --> 00:50:17,437
Don't I dream during the day, right?
I wake up and him this died.

394
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:19,238
Excepto today.

395
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:23,640
You have some antecedents
of mental diseases in his/her family?

396
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:24,642
No.

397
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:30,344
And on you same, and those episodes
of psychoses, loss of memory...

398
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:32,446
deceiving judgements...

399
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:35,548
I don't want him to die!
It was a car accident.

400
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:38,849
- No and crime to imagine something.
- I am not to imagine!

401
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:40,351
Him this died!

402
00:50:48,554 --> 00:50:52,055
Good, and a little strange.

403
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:55,057
But the prescription of the
medicine and for his/her good.

404
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:56,058
Because?

405
00:50:56,059 --> 00:51:00,760
Because probably and the best
thing for itself at this time.

406
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:03,562
help-there-to to be calmer.

407
00:51:04,663 --> 00:51:10,065
You think gets
to visit me here tomorrow?

408
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:32,172
- Ei! He/she looks who this here!

What was?
What does happen he/she?

412
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,680
I know that I walk to act of
strange way, but there is something strange.

413
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:48,681
- There is something very strange.
- And with the children?

414
00:51:48,682 --> 00:51:51,283
No, no, no, they are well,
at least for the time being.

415
00:51:51,284 --> 00:51:53,185
Can we talk in another place?

416
00:51:53,186 --> 00:51:55,186
Only we just, caught the
girls and we are going to some besiege.

She will be with
ugly scars forever?

457
00:55:59,793 --> 00:56:01,694
I don't want to hear to speak
on the scars.

458
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:02,695
Because and what not?

459
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:06,497
To Jesus Christ's eyes
there are no scars.

460
00:56:06,498 --> 00:56:10,299
I don't care with that the
other they tell you, this well?

461

Yes, as a princess.

00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:26,508
My two princesses.

What? What? These to blame me
because of the situation?

471
00:57:16,028 --> 00:57:18,928
I asked for your mother to be

472
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,930

474
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,933
- To take care of the children!
- I don't need any help.

475
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:28,035
He/she looks, you can rest.

Who knows,
some alone time for you.

477

For the one what? Time for me, for the one what?

478
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,840
- Of the one what and what these to speak? I never said...
- You won't divorce the children.

479
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:40,042
I am a good mother.

I need to go, I waited
one year for this interview.

504
01:00:46,316 --> 01:00:48,917
Haul of the plus, it can
to be good for us, do you know?

505
01:00:49,418 --> 01:00:51,819
To give a time each other.

506
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:55,321
It can be a larger time
of what you made calculations.

507
01:00:56,022 --> 01:00:58,222
It is if some thing
to happen you?

508
01:00:59,124 --> 01:01:02,425
Some thing can happen with me
in my road for the work.

509
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:04,526
- Should I stop working?
- Do you want me to implore?

510
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,828
I implore, please, don't just go,
you have children and you have family.

511
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:09,730
Why tell that,
do you think I forgot of that?

512
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:11,231
- No, I know that you didn't forget...
- Because I didn't forget!

513
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:12,432
I noticed that, I didn't say
that you forgot...

514
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:13,934
- Fortunately, good.
- He/she just listens.

515
01:01:13,935 --> 01:01:15,135
- Certain, just..
- You don't listen to me!

516
01:01:15,136 --> 01:01:16,936
- He/she just listens to me!
- For! For!

517
01:01:18,538 --> 01:01:21,139
He/she does me only a favor.

518
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:25,141
If tomorrow it goes Wednesday, please
does he/she wake up me before you leave?

519
01:01:25,142 --> 01:01:27,242
- If tomorrow Wednesday goes?
- Just... I know that seems madness.

520
01:01:27,243 --> 01:01:29,844
Just, please, does he/she wake up me, this well?

521
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:31,345

522
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:33,347
Do you promise me?!

523
01:01:35,248 --> 01:01:38,749

01:02:38,973 --> 01:02:42,474
Everything well, everything well, right.
They lack two days.

01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:55,081
Did we talk us?

535
01:02:55,182 --> 01:02:57,783
We were us yesterday,
don't you remember?

536
01:03:00,784 --> 01:03:04,185
(CLAIRE)

537
01:03:09,788 --> 01:03:12,089
- Mother, I have to go.
- What?

538
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:15,090
You have to be with the girls, you had
the largest shock of your life yesterday.

539
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,092
Nor tell me.

540
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:54,103
He/she has some subject that
in the owe-millstones to talk?

541
01:03:54,304 --> 01:03:57,105
Something on my husband?

542
01:04:02,107 --> 01:04:06,808
To talk?

543
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,310
I think he/she ended of doing.

544
01:04:12,912 --> 01:04:14,712
He will betray myself.

545
01:04:16,014 --> 01:04:17,614
What?

546
01:04:19,216 --> 01:04:23,117
He/she waits one minute, as
did you know, as you discovered?

547
01:04:23,218 --> 01:04:24,918
I talked with her,
she told me everything.

548
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:27,220
- When?!
- Today.

549
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:31,322
Oh, wanted I feel a lot,
you still these in shock?

550
01:04:31,323 --> 01:04:32,623
No!

551
01:04:33,725 --> 01:04:36,525
I already went by the state
of shock there are already some days.

552
01:04:37,827 --> 01:04:43,728
All this and bad, accident
and other woman, and a confusion.

553
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:45,930
I don't know if and that bad.

554
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:50,132
Maybe this had to have happened.

555
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:52,534
What and what do want to say?

556
01:04:54,335 --> 01:04:57,136
He knows that he/she still didn't make anything.

557
01:04:57,137 --> 01:05:01,038
The damage that the would cost us, the girls.

558
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:06,140
Maybe it didn't go enough,
therefore he decided to go behind something different.

559
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:09,542
You these to hear him/it
what these to say?

560
01:05:09,543 --> 01:05:11,344
We were us friends of fourth Annie.

561
01:05:11,845 --> 01:05:14,946
We were us room friends,
two girls...

562
01:05:14,947 --> 01:05:18,047
My room friend was a liar.

563
01:05:35,553 --> 01:05:37,854
We have of the it politicizes of the life insurance.

564
01:05:39,455 --> 01:05:44,257
Now, in agreement with the insurance,
your daughters' education this solved.

565
01:05:44,258 --> 01:05:48,359
And, with what it was left, you
you will also be well financially.

566
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:54,061
You know Linda...

567
01:05:54,762 --> 01:05:57,263
I have to tell you,
of the "timming" in that all this was made.

568
01:05:57,264 --> 01:05:59,265
"Timming!" What do you mean?

569
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:03,067
Jim passed to see me on Wednesday
for the guile, for me to formulate the insurance.

570
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,168
- Wednesday?
- Yes.

571
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:08,870
And he seemed very anxious, as if
he was not sure that would live.

572
01:06:08,871 --> 01:06:12,772
And he spoke about you and
of the children, and he said that

573
01:06:12,773 --> 01:06:16,574
He/she doesn't matter what happens, he wanted
to have the certainty that all you were well."

574
01:06:16,575 --> 01:06:19,476
And you were witness of the accident.

575
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:22,078
I want to say, that no and problem.

576
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,479
The report of it polices confirmed
that everything was an accident, then...

577
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,382
I will put in clean plates to the central office,
and they will give you a check.

578
01:06:54,089 --> 01:06:57,090
Beautiful view, no and?

I have two daughters, more my mother.

582
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:15,599
No and an important thing,
he/she happens with a lot of people.

01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,902
They pass for here as well as you did,
he/she sees a house in the edge of a beautiful lake.

584
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:23,903
Some say for himself:
That beautiful place to resume the life.

585
01:07:25,705 --> 01:07:28,406

Dear good night.

Girls, they can do
less noise, please?

01:11:41,204 --> 01:11:47,305
- Hot Sunday.
- All the day.

617
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:53,408
Because you don't take the
children for walking?

618
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,410
You know, they be one
little of together time.

01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:56,431
Hello priest...

624
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,633
Beautiful...

625
01:13:01,334 --> 01:13:03,635
There is how long.

626
01:13:09,338 --> 01:13:12,438
I am afraid priest.

627
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:24,743
Some didn't diffuse. He/she ate!

628
01:13:27,645 --> 01:13:31,446
Dutch presenter of
you moderated in Carolina's coast.

629
01:13:31,447 --> 01:13:33,548
A hysterical woman declares...

630
01:13:33,649 --> 01:13:38,150
to have gone by a terrible hurricane
that still had not happened.

631
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:40,251
Then the one what with she happened?

632
01:13:40,252 --> 01:13:43,153
They hung her/it for being witch.

633
01:13:43,154 --> 01:13:48,555
Two days later, the city
he/she completes was pulled by a hurricane.

634
01:13:48,556 --> 01:13:50,157
And horrible.

635
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:53,658
We are going to the half of the century XX.

636
01:13:53,659 --> 01:13:57,260
Boston 1918.

637
01:13:57,261 --> 01:13:59,862
During the big it influences of the epidemics.

638
01:13:59,863 --> 01:14:02,664
The priest said there are some
friends that it had been in the future.

639
01:14:02,665 --> 01:14:05,766
He/she saw the two small children's graves.

640
01:14:05,767 --> 01:14:09,768
When he was crazy, he/she threw us
two for not spreading the disease.

641
01:14:09,769 --> 01:14:11,469
Oh my God.

642
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,871
The autopsy showed that the
children were never infected.

643
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:18,073
He committed suicide
one week later.

644
01:14:19,674 --> 01:14:22,475
Who are those people,
because that happened?

645
01:14:22,476 --> 01:14:24,477
See...

646
01:14:24,478 --> 01:14:28,179
This world and full of...
inexplicable phenomena.

647
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,380
Nobody knows him/it because.

648
01:14:30,381 --> 01:14:35,783
Some people find, that them
they suffer than the old ones call of...

649
01:14:35,784 --> 01:14:39,585
Blessed for the
absenteeism of Judas.

650
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:43,387
The dangers of the little faith.

651
01:14:43,388 --> 01:14:44,588
Little faith.

652
01:14:44,589 --> 01:14:48,890
And the notion that the nature
of the horror this in the own back yard.

653
01:14:48,891 --> 01:14:51,592
Same spiritually.

654
01:14:51,593 --> 01:14:55,094
The people that lost their faiths

655
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:57,996
they are as empty cans.

656
01:14:57,997 --> 01:15:04,098
They are more susceptiveis of they have their lives
taken by other larger forks than them own.

657
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,100
He/she resembles a curse more.

658
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,102
Or a miracle.

659
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:11,603
Because, but I don't believe in miracles.

660
01:15:12,005 --> 01:15:15,305
Everyday ours
life can be a miracle.

661
01:15:16,007 --> 01:15:20,208
I don't feel in that way, not for me.

662
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:23,310
Priest...

663
01:15:24,511 --> 01:15:27,412
Something horrible this to happen.

664
01:15:27,413 --> 01:15:31,814
I need itself, I need
of his/her help, I need a direction.

665
01:15:31,815 --> 01:15:33,715
I need faith.

666
01:15:33,716 --> 01:15:39,518
Faith, and just to have faith in
something hauls of you own.

667
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:44,620
Something that you are not able to
to feel, to smell or to play...

668
01:15:45,021 --> 01:15:48,522
As hope... or love.

669
01:15:50,724 --> 01:15:54,025
I believe that go
to leave that everything go leave.

670
01:15:55,026 --> 01:15:58,627
Maybe you should try
to rescue that again everything.

671
01:15:58,828 --> 01:16:00,429
But if it goes too late?

672
