1
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:21,384
(ominous music)

2
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:26,522
(thunder rumbling)

3
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:02,792
- Okay, don't panic
and you'll be fine.

4
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:04,827
Just let the weapon do the work.

5
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:06,362
- Oh, Leigh, this is ridiculous.

6
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:08,898
I've never handled a
gun before in my life.

7
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:10,099
I'll probably end
up shooting myself

8
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,534
in the foot or something.

9
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:17,874
- [Leigh] To keep you safe.

10
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:19,742
Always.

11
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:24,614
Look.

12
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:26,649
Look.

13
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:28,651
- [Katherine] What about you?

14
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:29,585
You wrote me and said

15
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,421
you were too scared to stay.

16
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:34,023
That's why I came to this place.

17
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:34,824
- We are leaving,

18
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:36,059
but not tonight.

19
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:39,562
(thunder rumbles)

20
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:42,498
She's not scared of anything.

21
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,401
- Well, let's just
get outta here.

22
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:46,769
We'll walk you to town

23
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:49,105
and we'll take the
last flight out.

24
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:50,273
- No chance.

25
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,676
It's too dangerous
outside at night.

26
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,214
- [Katherine] Not as dangerous
as having a loaded pistol

27
00:01:58,214 --> 00:01:59,782
around a baby.

28
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:02,719
- Shut up, Katherine.

29
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:05,922
I know what I'm doing.

30
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:09,158
We're trapped here tonight.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,695
The flood channels
cut us off, Kat.

32
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,898
- That's okay, 'cause
I called a cab.

33
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,533
- Oh really?

34
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,035
I cancelled it.

35
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:20,570
- Perfect.

36
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,606
- I'm sorry, we're not
in San Francisco here.

37
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:34,283
Katherine, it will be all right.

38
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:36,152
It'll be just fine.

39
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:39,322
- You know, you keep
telling me that,

40
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:40,523
and then you give
me one of Dad's

41
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:41,758
Vietnam souvenirs

42
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:44,127
and you tell me to
just pull the trigger.

43
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:46,162
I don't think that's all right.

44
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:47,363
- Do your crazy sister a favor

45
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:49,398
and just hold onto it, okay?

46
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:51,167
Just to make me feel better.

47
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,902
- About what?

48
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:55,271
- I don't want anything
to happen to my baby.

49
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:03,346
- It's after midnight.

50
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:05,047
Merry Christmas.

51
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:06,749
- Merry Christmas, honey.

52
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:08,151
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,088
Storms always make me afraid.

54
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,726
(thunder rumbles)

55
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,036
(ominous music)

56
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:50,293
(ominous music)

57
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,037
Katherine!

58
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:04,006
Get away from my baby

59
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:05,308
you son of a bitch.

60
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:07,944
(gun fires)

61
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:08,878
Take her!

62
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:10,046
- [Katherine] Oh my God.

63
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,747
Okay.

64
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:13,916
Okay, okay.

65
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,118
(baby crying)

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,521
- Are you all right?

67
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:24,694
(growling)

68
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:32,134
(screaming)

69
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:39,242
(suspenseful music)

70
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:47,183
(ominous music)

71
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,314
(suspenseful music)

72
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:34,617
(door squealing open)

73
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:48,064
- [Voiceover] Four years dead

74
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:50,166
for something I didn't do.

75
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,801
The judge said I was a Martense

76
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,003
and that enough was alone
to convict me of anything.

77
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:56,539
But now I was out.

78
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,708
And no family, no prospects.

79
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,943
Nothing to look
forward to at all

80
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:02,778
except an invitation
from a petty thief

81
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:04,180
who used to run with my father.

82
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,383
He had something for me.

83
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:09,118
Thieves stick together I guess.

84
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,156
- Sidney.

85
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,357
(chuckling)

86
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:17,726
Sidney, Sidney.

87
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:21,097
What happened?

88
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:22,698
I'll tell you one thing, Sid,

89
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:24,100
you look much better now

90
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,135
than you ever did
when you were alive.

91
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:30,873
So don't worry, be happy.

92
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:32,808
(chuckling)

93
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,711
Very nice.

94
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:39,815
- I hope I'm not interrupting

95
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:42,218
a beautiful, personal moment.

96
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:44,019
- You are, but what the hell?

97
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,921
(laughing)

98
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,490
- Hey, old buddy.

99
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,758
- Hey, I heard you
did pretty good, kid.

100
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:51,360
- I wasn't anybody's bitch.

101
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,462
- Oh, come on, you don't
gotta tell me that.

102
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,064
How you feeling?

103
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,665
- I have to check
with a parole officer

104
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:58,567
every other day.

105
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,668
I can't take out a bank loan

106
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:00,703
and I can't vote,

107
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:02,438
but I feel pretty damn good.

108
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:03,873
- Yeah, I know.

109
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:04,907
I know.

110
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,543
You're still wearin'
your con shoes.

111
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,080
You know, they sent
over a couple of pair

112
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,748
for old Sid here.

113
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:14,416
Couldn't decide whether
he wanted to be buried

114
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,652
in his oxfords or his loafers.

115
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:18,954
Maybe they're your size.

116
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:21,190
- Whoa, hey, I'll buy
my own shoes, Knaggs.

117
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,057
Thanks.

118
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,227
- Yeah,

119
00:09:25,227 --> 00:09:27,763
and you're gonna be
able to afford 'em now.

120
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:29,231
(laughs)

121
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:31,267
Did you bring it with ya?

122
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,134
- [John] Yeah.

123
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:33,335
- [Knaggs] Good.

124
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:34,470
- Can't say that I know
what the hell it is.

125
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:43,612
(ominous music)

126
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:47,683
Leffert's corners.

127
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,052
- Yeah, it's a nut

128
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:52,254
and about 200 miles
south of here.

129
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:54,557
Your Dad really liked
the bar down there.

130
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,826
- That's not news, Knaggs.

131
00:09:57,826 --> 00:09:58,761
So what is this?

132
00:09:58,761 --> 00:09:59,762
Floor plans of the pool tables?

133
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:01,430
- Naw, it's a cemetery.

134
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:04,333
And in that cemetery

135
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,702
is buried a guy who is stuffed

136
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:08,470
with money.

137
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,072
- Bullshit.

138
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,408
- Hey, this is your
family legacy, kid.

139
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:14,877
Your dad buried that guy

140
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:16,512
just before he got sent away.

141
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:18,814
- So how do you know
that it's there?

142
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:22,117
- Because I stuffed the stiff.

143
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:25,754
Now, I didn't exactly count
the dough, you understand,

144
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:27,423
but let me put it this way,

145
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:29,592
if you were to
stand this guy up,

146
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:32,394
he'd be pissing
thousand dollar bills.

147
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,630
(laughs)

148
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,865
Your old man asked me to
hang onto this for you.

149
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,102
- Attica sent me his
personal effects.

150
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:42,538
Mine was in a birthday card

151
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:43,839
that was never mailed.

152
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:46,508
- Let's face it, kid.

153
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:47,876
You and your dad
don't exactly qualify

154
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,578
for family of the year.

155
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:53,983
But in a way, this
kind of makes that up.

156
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,517
- Hey, I just did five years.

157
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:58,754
I don't plan on spending the
rest of my life in prison.

158
00:10:58,754 --> 00:10:59,588
- So what are you gonna do?

159
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:00,789
Walk away from this?

160
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:02,324
Hey, that's fine with me,

161
00:11:02,324 --> 00:11:03,659
but I gotta tell you,

162
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:05,327
your old man set this up

163
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:08,197
so you wouldn't end up like him.

164
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,132
- So what's your end, specs?

165
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,835
- Well, I figure
my half of the map

166
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:14,136
is worth uh,

167
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:15,871
a neat 20 percent.

168
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:20,109
Of course, now that
I know where it is...

169
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,410
- [John] You'll take it all.

170
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:25,047
- I don't need your
fuckin' permission.

171
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,215
Now I'm just tryin' to do right

172
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:27,683
by an old friend at Christmas.

173
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:30,152
All right?

174
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:33,822
- What do you say
you knock off early?

175
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:36,892
You take us a little ride.

176
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:41,196
- Yeah, I'd like that, but uh,

177
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:42,431
I gotta hang around here.

178
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:44,967
Somebody's gonna come
to pick up old Sid.

179
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,101
Why don't you go on ahead?

180
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:48,070
I'll catch up with you later.

181
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,406
- You're sure no one
else knows about this?

182
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:52,641
- Naw, I ain't
seen them scumbags

183
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:54,109
in over five years.

184
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,212
Your dad was gonna protect you.

185
00:11:58,113 --> 00:11:59,281
Even now.

186
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:03,585
- I'll see you tonight, buddy.

187
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:04,520
- Okay.

188
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,921
- [John] Oh, and uh, specs,

189
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,056
bring your own shovel.

190
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:09,458
(laughing)

191
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:13,696
(ominous music)

192
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:17,766
- Goddamn.

193
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,101
Bastards.

194
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:20,803
Got a little surprise
for you tonight.

195
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:30,145
(dramatic music)

196
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:47,830
(gate squealing)

197
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:06,215
(screaming)

198
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:07,816
- [Doctor] Hold her still.

199
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:09,051
- Give her something.

200
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:10,319
- The last of the codeine

201
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:11,787
and the heal of a
bottle of bourbon

202
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:13,756
are inside her right now.

203
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:15,224
- I'm sorry, doc.

204
00:13:15,224 --> 00:13:16,658
- Oh, forget it.

205
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:19,027
I'd be screamin' my
head off, believe me.

206
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:23,065
- I couldn't even
see what it was.

207
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:25,067
It was just on me
all of a sudden.

208
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,835
And, and then,

209
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,837
I felt the blood in my mouth.

210
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:29,872
- You'll be all right.

211
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,373
You're fine.

212
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:33,776
Listen, now that's just
not too deep, all right.

213
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:36,111
Listen, Beth,

214
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:37,045
the first thing you gotta do

215
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,481
is just pack this away.

216
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:43,919
Healing starts from
the inside, right.

217
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,055
- But isn't this
what everybody does?

218
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:49,324
I mean, the ones who've
lived through it.

219
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:51,960
- Lie still now.

220
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:56,965
I think you're gonna
be all right now.

221
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:01,670
One more.

222
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:08,343
- Thanks.

223
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:09,378
- Good.

224
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,515
You just lay there
and you try to relax.

225
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:24,893
- [Katherine] How
many did you get?

226
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:26,795
- Four boxes, Sarge.

227
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:32,067
- These haven't been
turned in a while.

228
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,402
The nitro's bleeding.

229
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:37,172
- Really?

230
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:38,140
- Doc.

231
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:43,812
(explosion)

232
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:44,713
- Wow.

233
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:48,183
Well, I guess ah...

234
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,187
We're ready to go to church.

235
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,659
- I don't think this
is such a good idea.

236
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:00,195
- I'm not going
back to my house.

237
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:02,464
My baby's not safe there.

238
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:03,932
- [Katherine] It's
too dangerous.

239
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:06,268
- Look, she's my patient.

240
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:08,003
She's with me, I
know she's safe.

241
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:12,908
- Get in.

242
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,851
- Ah-ha.

243
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:25,287
Here it is.

244
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:27,322
All set now.

245
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:30,125
What?

246
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,627
What is it?

247
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:33,829
We're finally doing this,
you trained, I kept my end.

248
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,198
- This is what I thought
the end of the world

249
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:37,933
was gonna look like.

250
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:40,168
(ominous music)

251
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:42,571
- Maybe.

252
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,506
Maybe not.

253
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:47,142
(ominous music)

254
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:49,478
Here's lookin' at you.

255
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:52,848
(ominous music)

256
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,655
- If you shoot a man, kill him,

257
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:01,723
and you don't pull a gun

258
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:04,026
unless you intend to shoot.

259
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,627
You listening to me, boy?

260
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:07,095
- Everyday.

261
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,898
- Just trying to fucking
teach you some things here.

262
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:10,499
- [John] What?

263
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:11,433
- What?

264
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,669
What you're really are inside.

265
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:15,003
A killer.

266
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:16,505
That's part of you.

267
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,539
(horn honks)

268
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:22,144
(horn blaring)

269
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,814
- Wow, Sid.

270
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:27,482
You know, you're a
lot more valuable dead

271
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:29,451
than you ever were alive, babe.

272
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:31,486
(laughing)

273
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:35,691
(dramatic music)

274
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:44,800
Can I help you, Miss?

275
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:48,837
- Misses.

276
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:51,173
I need to make
some arrangements.

277
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,810
- Oh, we understand.

278
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:59,681
And, may I take this opportunity

279
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:01,583
to extend to you

280
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,686
my deepest condolences.

281
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:09,625
- Yes, you may.

282
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,020
It should be quiet, dignified.

283
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,755
That's very important.

284
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:43,859
- This is our
forever yours model.

285
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,032
It comes fully lined
with soft, white silk.

286
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,835
And uh, it has a

287
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:56,238
heavenly blue body.

288
00:17:57,773 --> 00:17:59,841
It is a little more expensive.

289
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,911
- Money doesn't concern me.

290
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,619
- My dear...

291
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,922
How's the world
been treating you?

292
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:16,825
- This'll only take a minute.

293
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,231
- [Ms. Marlowe]
Less time than that.

294
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:24,700
- Ah shit.

295
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:29,104
- [Bennett] I hear
tales of riches.

296
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:31,740
- Oh no, friend,
you got it wrong.

297
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,009
This here's a poor neighborhood.

298
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:36,411
I can't refuse anybody.

299
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:38,246
- So you won't refuse
me then, will you?

300
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:44,853
Well, there's a lot
of money in death.

301
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:47,656
Preventing it, causing it,

302
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:50,258
taking care of the leftovers.

303
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:51,293
Hello, Sid.

304
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:55,397
You've done all three at one
time or another, my dear.

305
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,101
But there again
I was forgettin'.

306
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,936
You were always a
modest man, weren't ya?

307
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,173
- Hey, c'mon, leave
Sid out of this.

308
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:07,109
I gotta ship him up
the coast tonight.

309
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:08,777
His widow's waitin' for him.

310
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:14,149
- Did you know they buried
Dillinger without his schlong?

311
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:17,552
Bastards, they cut it off.

312
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,490
Put it in a pickle
jar for a souvenir.

313
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,893
You uh, you wouldn't do
nothing like that, would ya?

314
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:29,131
- [Ms. Marlowe] Shame on you.

315
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:32,434
- Look at that.

316
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,835
No wonder he's dead.

317
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:39,741
- [Voiceover] Old man never
told me about our family.

318
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:40,809
He said we were orphans,

319
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,111
and he liked it that way.

320
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:45,147
The less I knew, the better.

321
00:19:45,147 --> 00:19:47,215
But when I turned towards
Leffert's corners,

322
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,450
I had a feeling I was going

323
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,252
somewhere I belonged.

324
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,554
I knew it like I knew the
inside of a federal prison

325
00:19:52,554 --> 00:19:53,889
or a work farm.

326
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,326
It was a bad feelin',
but I had to keep goin'.

327
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,695
Even though every
goddamn thought I had

328
00:20:00,695 --> 00:20:02,330
was to turn around
and get the hell away

329
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,399
as fast as I could.

330
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,769
(ominous music)

331
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:12,140
(groaning)

332
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,112
- [Bennett] You helped
Martense rip me off.

333
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:18,680
Don't fuckin' deny it.

334
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,750
- I fuckin' told you,

335
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,618
I don't know where it is.

336
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:25,554
(coughing)

337
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:31,693
- My pet prison guard
brought me this.

338
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:37,432
Where's the other half, Skelton?

339
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,570
- I just prepped that body.

340
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,038
I didn't bury it.

341
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:47,309
- They will kill you, you know.

342
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:55,250
- Wanna go for a split?

343
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,518
- Ah.

344
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:57,886
I knew you'd come around.

345
00:20:57,886 --> 00:20:59,421
I told you, didn't I?

346
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:00,689
All right.

347
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:01,356
20 percent.

348
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:02,824
Don't push me.

349
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:04,926
- You know Leffert's corners?

350
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:05,861
- Uh-huh.

351
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:07,796
- There's a cemetery there.

352
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:10,699
Martin's kid just
left with the map.

353
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:13,268
Left a couple hours ago.

354
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:14,936
- Well, I should look
forward to meetin' the lad.

355
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:23,078
- [Knaggs] Oh shit.

356
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:26,648
- You know, I liked the way
you had the guy fixed up.

357
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:30,685
He uh, he looked real natural.

358
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:32,320
- [Knaggs] Thank you.

359
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:38,260
(ominous music)

360
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:46,067
- You lied to me, Skelton.

361
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:49,537
That's what hurts.

362
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:50,372
- I gotta go,

363
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:51,806
I gotta go meet the kid.

364
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,441
He's waitin' for me.

365
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:55,176
We had a deal.

366
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:56,678
- So did we.

367
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,681
(gun fires)

368
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:00,882
(groaning)

369
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,937
(thunder rumbles)

370
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,776
- The storm's coming in.

371
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:29,311
- So is the dark.

372
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,445
Let's go.

373
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:46,261
- Bless this servant
of God, Maria,

374
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:48,930
with the holy body and
blood of Christ the King

375
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,999
for the forgiveness of her sins,

376
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:53,234
and for life eternal.

377
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:02,477
- Put it down easy.

378
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:08,383
- Bless this servant
of God, Ryan,

379
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,452
with the holy body and blood

380
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:12,320
of Christ the King,

381
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,356
for the forgiveness of his sins

382
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:16,124
and for life eternal.

383
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,461
Drink the blood of Christ.

384
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:22,497
- You should drink too, Father.

385
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:25,633
Especially tonight.

386
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,469
- It might make you feel better.

387
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:29,070
- [Father] I told you I
will not have the church,

388
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,206
I will not have God's house

389
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:33,308
being used as battle field.

390
00:23:33,308 --> 00:23:35,477
Not on the eve of his birth.

391
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:37,512
- [Katherine] I didn't
choose your church, Father.

392
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:38,747
This is where they're hiding.

393
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:41,850
- [Man] I'll go check
the weather on the radio.

394
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,451
- [Katherine] Storm
will be in by midnight.

395
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:46,021
- [Father] I expected more
reverence from you, doctor.

396
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:48,189
- Well, can I say, Father,

397
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:49,424
nothing's left.

398
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:52,293
You see, I just got tired
of stitching people up

399
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:54,462
just to watch 'em die anyway.

400
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:55,463
For these.

401
00:23:57,432 --> 00:23:59,868
Bastards of terms turned
into a slaughterhouse.

402
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:02,504
- Now, you should be fighting
with your faith and with this.

403
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:03,905
- A book won't stop them.

404
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:07,375
They'll tear it
and you to shreds.

405
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,643
- Oh, c'mon, Father.

406
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:09,577
These damn things

407
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:10,745
have been living under our feet

408
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:12,213
and tearing us
apart for 20 years.

409
00:24:13,314 --> 00:24:14,482
This is real.

410
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:19,954
- I know that better than you.

411
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:26,027
- [Doctor] You're just going
to stand there and do nothing!

412
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:28,096
- I'll give myself over
if that's what it wants.

413
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:29,064
Christ shed his blood for us,

414
00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:31,699
and I will shed mine for you.

415
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:33,268
- [Man] It won't be enough.

416
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:34,936
- You're gonna get yourself
killed, for nothing.

417
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,675
- Hey, hey Marie.

418
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:42,444
You gotta stay here with us.

419
00:24:42,444 --> 00:24:45,013
You're not going to be
protected out there.

420
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:45,680
Hey, what are ya...

421
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,848
- Let her go!

422
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:52,153
At least she'll
beat the sun home.

423
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:55,890
- Gee, Doc.

424
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,825
I remember you telling me

425
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:58,059
that is safe

426
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,095
if I got home before dark.

427
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:05,500
Remember?

428
00:25:18,446 --> 00:25:22,217
(dramatic music)

429
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:52,547
- Hey kid.

430
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:55,717
Where is everybody?

431
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:56,651
Wait.

432
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:58,586
Do you know where the church is?

433
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:07,495
(ominous music)

434
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:12,600
- [Katherine] If
they come up here

435
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,002
the trip wire will
nail at least two.

436
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:18,339
- [Doctor] Huh?

437
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:20,642
Oh yeah, booby trap safe.

438
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:22,343
- Say, four would have
been perfect for this.

439
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:26,648
One time these charges out,

440
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:27,849
cover the outside circle

441
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:29,584
and save the rest.

442
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:30,919
- Well, let's not mess around.

443
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:31,686
Let's do it all.

444
00:26:31,686 --> 00:26:33,454
Wipe 'em out.

445
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:35,356
- It's a waste until we
can pinpoint the nest.

446
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:36,391
I need backup.

447
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,227
You never know when there's
gonna be a second wave.

448
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:42,263
- [Doc] You're the expert.

449
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,967
- [Woman] No, I'm just
doing what Leigh would.

450
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:47,569
This is all I have left of her.

451
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,505
- Your sister
couldn't do it better.

452
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,475
(clanging)

453
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:55,877
- Yeah, she could.

454
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,088
- Katherine.

455
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:08,890
Katherine?

456
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,958
- Yeah?

457
00:27:11,326 --> 00:27:12,260
- After we do this,

458
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,095
let's find any place else.

459
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:18,700
- Careful where
you stagger, doc.

460
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,312
- Yep.

461
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:43,391
- We're hot.

462
00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:48,563
- The weatherman says an hour.

463
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:49,764
- Oh yeah?

464
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:51,633
Well that thunder
tells me half an hour.

465
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:53,001
- That'll still give us
enough time to get to Miller's

466
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:54,969
and get the gas truck.

467
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:58,439
- Oh, this is going
to be quite a party.

468
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:06,581
- I know the Martense
family record

469
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:08,850
as well as I know
the holy scripture.

470
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:12,220
I know there was a
bastard son of the clan,

471
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,123
who escaped and went to
live in the outside world.

472
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:19,294
But he was a Martense,
and killing came easy.

473
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:21,963
He died in prison,

474
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:24,299
the only Martense not to be
buried in Leffert's Corner.

475
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,869
We also know that

476
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,337
he had a son.

477
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:39,981
(ominous music)

478
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:52,153
- Katherine, there's
somebody out there.

479
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:53,388
- [Katherine] What?

480
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:55,857
- I saw something.

481
00:29:55,857 --> 00:29:57,825
- This is still a church.

482
00:29:57,825 --> 00:30:00,361
If someone's come for
comfort, they deserve it.

483
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:01,662
- I'll take care of it.

484
00:30:02,897 --> 00:30:04,699
- It must be one
of those things.

485
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:06,834
What about the 45?

486
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,636
- [Doc] Hold off.

487
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:09,771
Those things don't come up

488
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:11,606
until the storm rises.

489
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:15,376
- Hey, Doc.

490
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:16,644
What don't you sober up,

491
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:17,879
see if we can get
to Miller's alive?

492
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,822
Don't even breathe.

493
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:30,324
Just stand straight up.

494
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:32,193
- Baby, I'm not
gonna move a hair.

495
00:30:32,193 --> 00:30:33,594
- I said straight.

496
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:39,967
Take one step back to clear.

497
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:46,207
Why'd you come here
when everyone in town

498
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:47,875
knows to stay away?

499
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,243
- I'm not from town.

500
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,614
- [Pierce] Now, I thought spec
said he was gonna be alone.

501
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:58,753
- Yeah, well they're certainly
well prepared, aren't they?

502
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,193
- Ah, looks like this Christmas

503
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:07,195
is going to be a treasure hunt.

504
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:13,701
- Pierce, this is a
Porsche, not a Toyota.

505
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:20,475
Well, I think before
we get our hands dirty,

506
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:22,844
a little spiritual
counsel's in order.

507
00:31:36,657 --> 00:31:40,461
(ominous music)

508
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:43,564
(banging)

509
00:31:52,406 --> 00:31:54,542
- [Father] You will
never repair this damage.

510
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,677
- [Doc] Well, (coughs)

511
00:31:56,677 --> 00:31:58,446
somebody's gotta do
something, Father,

512
00:31:58,446 --> 00:31:59,981
and that ain't just you anymore.

513
00:32:01,282 --> 00:32:02,683
- Not here.

514
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:04,018
I won't have that here.

515
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:04,952
- Sorry, Father,

516
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:05,887
I caught this one out back

517
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:07,054
trying to defuse the dynamite.

518
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:07,788
- You son of a...

519
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:09,423
- Back off!

520
00:32:09,423 --> 00:32:11,325
I want answers.

521
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:12,260
- Hey, I don't know
what you people

522
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,995
got going on here.

523
00:32:13,995 --> 00:32:16,063
I just wanna get the hell out.

524
00:32:16,063 --> 00:32:17,164
- No problem.

525
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:18,633
As soon as we blow this cemetery

526
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:20,601
you walk away.

527
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:23,604
(thunder rumbling)

528
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,309
- It's starting.

529
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,914
- You cost me time.

530
00:32:34,782 --> 00:32:36,017
On him.

531
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:43,791
(thunder rumbles)

532
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:48,396
The timers are set to
go off in ten minutes.

533
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:52,500
- Hey, lady,

534
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,502
I'm not waitin' for anything.

535
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:55,836
- You got no choice.

536
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:08,616
- What the hell is
this all about anyway?

537
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:10,785
- You shutting up and
letting us do some good.

538
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:14,322
And quit staring at me.

539
00:33:16,657 --> 00:33:17,525
(thunder rumbles)

540
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,727
(screaming)

541
00:33:21,762 --> 00:33:23,431
- No!

542
00:33:23,431 --> 00:33:24,832
No!

543
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:25,833
No!

544
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:30,571
- [Katherine] Stop!

545
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:31,405
Get back!

546
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:34,375
(gun firing rapidly)

547
00:33:36,177 --> 00:33:37,345
- [Father] No!

548
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:38,946
- [Katherine] The
dynamite's gotta go now.

549
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:42,650
(screaming)

550
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,051
- [John] I've had
enough of this shit.

551
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,494
- Oh, God, I know I
failed as your servant.

552
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:54,795
Take your anger out on me,

553
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:57,365
not this miserable souls
who've gone astray.

554
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,268
- Hey, freak show.

555
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:02,837
(gun fires)

556
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:05,072
(groaning)

557
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:08,209
(ominous music)

558
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:10,411
(thunder rumbles)

559
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:12,079
Nice to see you kid.

560
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:17,151
Now,

561
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:19,420
you bring that flask water out,

562
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,122
handle first.

563
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:22,723
Real slow.

564
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:26,894
(ominous music)

565
00:34:34,735 --> 00:34:36,270
- Now go on, let her up.

566
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,506
Show a bit respect.

567
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:46,681
(chuckles)

568
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:48,416
Well, well.

569
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,917
Eric's boy.

570
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:53,120
- [Pierce] He loved
Clint Eastwood.

571
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,792
- Sorry to interrupt
the service, my dears.

572
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:03,264
Well, I'll make all of this

573
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:04,398
very easy for you.

574
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:07,068
I'm just here for the money.

575
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:09,637
- Money?

576
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:10,738
What money?

577
00:35:11,806 --> 00:35:13,340
- Now, I hate to
disappoint you, Father.

578
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,013
But you are not gonna
decorate your lovely church

579
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:21,215
with my investment.

580
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:22,183
All right?

581
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:25,553
Now you have a choice.

582
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:30,224
One of you dies every uh...

583
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:31,625
Ten minutes,

584
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:32,827
'till I get it.

585
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,467
(thunder rumbles)

586
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,435
- We don't know what
you're talking about.

587
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:43,037
We can't help you.

588
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:46,273
- Well, then I suggest
the good Father

589
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:47,775
say the last rights

590
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:49,510
over the whole
fucking lot of you.

591
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:52,913
- You always were
a son of a bitch.

592
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:22,576
- Cheer up Father.

593
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,246
You might be meetin'
your boss tonight.

594
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:28,382
- All unplugged.

595
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:33,320
- Now that we're all
seated comfortably...

596
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,958
Where is my money?

597
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,961
- Can't you see that
what's going on here

598
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,596
has got nothing to do with you

599
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:44,131
and your money?

600
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:48,369
- Everything has to
do with my money.

601
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,806
(groaning)

602
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:54,975
(ominous music)

603
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:56,443
Put it down here, did you?

604
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:57,912
- [Pregnant Woman] No, don't.

605
00:36:57,912 --> 00:36:59,513
If you break that
down, we're all dead.

606
00:36:59,513 --> 00:37:00,447
You included.

607
00:37:00,447 --> 00:37:01,782
- [Man] Oh God, don't do that.

608
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:07,054
What do you think, Randy?

609
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:09,924
Is that what will happen?

610
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:12,026
- [Woman] If we're lucky.

611
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:16,063
- [Bennett] Is that what's
with all the armour then?

612
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:18,599
What are you protecting here?

613
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:22,102
- Why don't you go down
there and find out?

614
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:25,005
- Because you won't.

615
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:27,408
Come on.

616
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,045
- [Beth] Don't do that!

617
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:33,881
You'll kill her.

618
00:37:33,881 --> 00:37:34,815
Stop it.

619
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:35,716
Can't you see she's the only one

620
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:37,618
who can help up?

621
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:39,386
- Don't be a hero,
you're not the type.

622
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:41,589
- Go to hell.

623
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,091
- Hold it, Bennett.

624
00:37:44,091 --> 00:37:46,260
They don't know anything
about the money.

625
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,028
They got some whole
different trip going on here,

626
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:49,830
I don't know what
the hell it is.

627
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,299
I stumbled in just like you did.

628
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:55,402
Your money is still buried.

629
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:02,509
My father wasn't specific.

630
00:38:02,509 --> 00:38:03,844
I didn't get a name.

631
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,418
- You better pray all
you find is your money.

632
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:13,721
- [Bennett] You better pray
I'm not disappointed, darling.

633
00:38:15,756 --> 00:38:16,857
- Hold it.

634
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:19,226
Hold it.

635
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:23,097
That's my grandmother.

636
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:24,164
That's gotta be it.

637
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:34,508
(dramatic music)

638
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:35,943
- [Bennett] Get rid of that.

639
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:43,651
(thunder rumbles)

640
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:55,396
- You dig, punk.

641
00:39:01,669 --> 00:39:03,370
- Hey, I'm not part of this.

642
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:05,739
- Oh no?

643
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,007
You murdered us all tonight.

644
00:39:07,007 --> 00:39:08,442
Congratulations.

645
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:47,014
(gasping)

646
00:39:47,014 --> 00:39:48,182
- No.

647
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:49,316
- Katherine, are you all right?

648
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:50,217
- No.

649
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:53,554
- Could you untie me, please?

650
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,596
I'm on my way, Beth.

651
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:05,199
You know, you picked
one hell of a night

652
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,835
to pull this little stunt.

653
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:10,471
- You're the ones in the wrong
place at the wrong time, Doc.

654
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:11,805
Uh-uh-uh.

655
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,907
- Father, my bag.

656
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:17,544
It's all right, Beth.

657
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:20,848
- This was supposed to be easy.

658
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:21,849
- All right.

659
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:24,752
- Doctor, I'm so sorry.

660
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:25,819
- I know, I know.

661
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:26,887
Let's just

662
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:27,721
have a little listen here

663
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:28,889
and what we've got.

664
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:32,393
Shhh.

665
00:40:33,961 --> 00:40:35,129
Uh-huh.

666
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:37,998
Well, I think you're
gonna be fine.

667
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,268
- Oh, I thought it was the baby.

668
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:42,202
- No, no.

669
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:44,772
I think it's the excitement.

670
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,345
- So who's the father?

671
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:53,547
(thunder rumbles)

672
00:40:56,517 --> 00:40:57,618
- He's gone.

673
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:01,655
- Why, when you told
him you were pregnant?

674
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:08,662
Give me his name
and I'll kill him.

675
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:15,536
(ominous music)

676
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:26,647
(thunder rumbles)

677
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:33,821
- [Pierce] Not a goddamn thing.

678
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:38,092
- You're just like your father.

679
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:39,493
Stupid and dead.

680
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:45,365
(gun firing)

681
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:49,136
- [John] No!

682
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,008
Ah, Jesus Christ.

683
00:41:56,076 --> 00:41:58,479
(screaming)

684
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:03,183
(gun fires)

685
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,990
Let go of me you son of a bitch.

686
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:16,330
(grunting)

687
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:35,849
- [Doc] Oh my God.

688
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:36,517
Oh Jesus.

689
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:38,018
No.

690
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:40,154
- [Father] The devil has
risen from the Sulfur pit.

691
00:42:42,556 --> 00:42:44,858
- She's not dead.

692
00:42:44,858 --> 00:42:45,526
Yet.

693
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:46,860
(ominous music)

694
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,529
(screaming)

695
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:49,830
(gun firing)

696
00:42:51,598 --> 00:42:54,034
(screaming)

697
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:04,945
(screaming)

698
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:11,685
There they are.

699
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:13,220
Nobody does a fucking thing

700
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,621
until I say so.

701
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:16,223
- Unless you want your
goddamn head ripped off,

702
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:18,525
I'd seal this up real quick.

703
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:20,794
(gun firing)

704
00:43:20,794 --> 00:43:22,996
- Go away!

705
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:24,231
- Fucking grizzly
bear or something.

706
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:25,966
- No!

707
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:27,467
Stop, you'll hit the girl.

708
00:43:29,136 --> 00:43:29,937
Get back!

709
00:43:29,937 --> 00:43:31,071
- [Doctor] I'm trying.

710
00:43:36,009 --> 00:43:37,244
- Keep her back.

711
00:43:37,244 --> 00:43:38,545
- Hey, lover boy.

712
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,415
Ooh, we really
are good together.

713
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,621
(ominous music)

714
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,068
- Oh no, you and your friends

715
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:03,170
know our little town secret.

716
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,438
You wanna move in?

717
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:05,806
I know a lot of places
you can get for cheap.

718
00:44:05,806 --> 00:44:06,740
- What the fuck?

719
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,609
That thing almost killed me.

720
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:11,011
- Hey, that's the first time

721
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:12,746
I thought it was on our side.

722
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:15,682
(laughing)

723
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:23,123
- When one offers no resistance,

724
00:44:23,123 --> 00:44:25,025
one invites evil.

725
00:44:26,493 --> 00:44:29,129
- Well, Father, I suggest
you un-fucking invite it.

726
00:44:30,497 --> 00:44:32,032
- We know where they live.

727
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,835
Tunnels everywhere.

728
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:38,005
And we do know how they feed

729
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:40,107
because this town has
been in the goddamn

730
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:42,309
dinner menu for 20 years.

731
00:44:44,177 --> 00:44:45,245
- Finally gonna do
something about it,

732
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:46,680
and you just fucked it up.

733
00:44:50,884 --> 00:44:53,220
- [Pregnant Woman] They devour
every living thing they can,

734
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,588
maybe leave the bones.

735
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:57,024
- Find the stones.

736
00:44:57,024 --> 00:44:57,858
Bringing?

737
00:44:57,858 --> 00:44:59,259
- That's the legend.

738
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:01,795
Hey, you've got some
blood on your nice suit.

739
00:45:01,795 --> 00:45:02,863
- Oh shit.

740
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:14,708
- Do you mind, bitch?

741
00:45:25,852 --> 00:45:27,788
(clanging)

742
00:45:27,788 --> 00:45:29,122
- Sorry, babe.

743
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:34,661
You're just a little
commando, aren't ya?

744
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:40,567
- Casualties closed.

745
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:41,835
Go on, break it up.

746
00:45:43,337 --> 00:45:47,040
(ominous music)

747
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:56,650
- I think gettin' out of here is

748
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,553
an excellent fuckin' priority.

749
00:46:00,987 --> 00:46:03,657
- I will tell you when to think.

750
00:46:04,524 --> 00:46:05,592
All right?

751
00:46:08,395 --> 00:46:09,496
Now, I hope you understand

752
00:46:09,496 --> 00:46:10,630
that Mr. Martense here

753
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,966
has put all your lives at risk

754
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:15,168
for refusing to cooperate.

755
00:46:16,603 --> 00:46:17,904
Now I don't give a toss

756
00:46:17,904 --> 00:46:19,806
if I have to feed
you all one piece

757
00:46:19,806 --> 00:46:21,575
at a time to that
thing down there

758
00:46:21,575 --> 00:46:23,543
on a silver fucking platter.

759
00:46:24,678 --> 00:46:26,913
All I want is what I want.

760
00:46:28,815 --> 00:46:31,385
So, who's gonna be first?

761
00:46:36,456 --> 00:46:37,624
- I can help you.

762
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,628
I can.

763
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:46,266
- Well, fuck me.

764
00:46:51,471 --> 00:46:52,906
- Here are the burial records,

765
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:54,741
so you should be able to
find what you're looking for.

766
00:46:56,243 --> 00:46:57,911
You came to me as a stranger,

767
00:46:57,911 --> 00:46:59,546
but I know your face.

768
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:05,318
You can kill me and spare
the others, can't you?

769
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:19,966
- Are you gonna kill us?

770
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:29,142
- How do you feel?

771
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:30,444
- What do you think?

772
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,114
I'm scared.

773
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:37,417
- Yeah, that's not what I meant.

774
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:40,387
You got something
growing inside you.

775
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:41,621
What about that?

776
00:47:44,424 --> 00:47:47,260
- How she feels is none
of your damn business.

777
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,361
If she has something
wrong with her,

778
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:49,629
I'll take care of it.

779
00:47:54,768 --> 00:47:56,036
- Soon, babe.

780
00:48:04,711 --> 00:48:08,882
(dramatic music)

781
00:48:15,922 --> 00:48:17,657
- Hey, Pierce.

782
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:21,828
- Hey Sir, if you wanna
talk to me, you pissant.

783
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:25,899
Show a little to the
man who's gonna kill ya.

784
00:48:25,899 --> 00:48:27,000
- Look, I think you know what

785
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,702
we're really up against here.

786
00:48:28,702 --> 00:48:29,703
I mean, you took a shot at it

787
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:30,837
for Christ's sake.

788
00:48:30,837 --> 00:48:32,539
- Let's see.

789
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:35,108
I shot the undertaker,

790
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:38,245
and that boy that you had
your arms wrapped around.

791
00:48:39,446 --> 00:48:41,581
I think,

792
00:48:41,581 --> 00:48:43,049
I kill you next.

793
00:48:44,751 --> 00:48:47,187
- Look, I just wanna
get out of here,

794
00:48:47,187 --> 00:48:49,055
and the only way that
that's gonna happen,

795
00:48:49,055 --> 00:48:50,824
is if you get your cash.

796
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:53,727
- Bennett's taking
care of that right now.

797
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:57,430
See, you've got nothing
to fuckin' offer.

798
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,566
- That priest doesn't know shit.

799
00:48:59,566 --> 00:49:01,101
He was stalling.

800
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:03,236
Your boss is gonna
be hung up for hours.

801
00:49:04,471 --> 00:49:05,972
Now, I can give you the map.

802
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:08,275
You just gotta let me
out the door first.

803
00:49:09,442 --> 00:49:12,812
- What about your new
friends, John boy, huh?

804
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:13,747
What about them?

805
00:49:13,747 --> 00:49:14,948
- Fuck 'em.

806
00:49:14,948 --> 00:49:17,951
Hey Pierce, if you know
where the money is,

807
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:20,320
you divide the shares your way.

808
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:23,690
Or no shares at all.

809
00:49:29,095 --> 00:49:30,096
- Five years ago

810
00:49:30,096 --> 00:49:32,332
the boy's father
robbed my casino

811
00:49:32,332 --> 00:49:35,001
and buried the money
in your cemetery.

812
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:38,872
Martense, crypt of the family.

813
00:49:42,008 --> 00:49:44,077
They also have a sense of humor.

814
00:49:44,077 --> 00:49:45,812
This is the name of the
cop who busted Martense

815
00:49:45,812 --> 00:49:47,147
and sent him up.

816
00:49:47,147 --> 00:49:48,982
This is the money grave.

817
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:50,884
Very clever.

818
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:52,819
- Well, the Martenses own us.

819
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:54,120
Always have.

820
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,991
- Not any longer, Father.

821
00:49:57,991 --> 00:50:00,694
Dad is dead, and
I've got the boy.

822
00:50:02,295 --> 00:50:04,664
- They have relatives.

823
00:50:04,664 --> 00:50:07,367
(ominous music)

824
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:12,205
- The old man always said
you were chicken shit,

825
00:50:12,205 --> 00:50:13,873
made your pocket
money robbing queers

826
00:50:13,873 --> 00:50:14,874
and old ladies.

827
00:50:14,874 --> 00:50:17,010
- When I was feeling lazy, yeah.

828
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,446
But when I had to drop
somebody, I didn't back off.

829
00:50:19,446 --> 00:50:20,714
- Ah, tough guy, I forgot.

830
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:22,782
- Don't swing your
dick with me, boy,

831
00:50:22,782 --> 00:50:24,684
or I'll cut it off.

832
00:50:24,684 --> 00:50:27,287
Oh, you wanna make a move?

833
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:28,254
Huh?

834
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:36,429
No, you don't.

835
00:50:37,597 --> 00:50:39,466
You know, you're just
like your old man.

836
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:43,803
Yellow-bellied,
scum sucking pig.

837
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:47,374
- It's your money now, Pierce.

838
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,478
- If I don't see it
in about one minute,

839
00:50:51,478 --> 00:50:53,380
I'm gonna start carvin' on you.

840
00:50:57,817 --> 00:50:59,386
(grunting)

841
00:51:03,356 --> 00:51:06,159
(groaning)

842
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:09,262
(dramatic music)

843
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,969
Do me a favor and kill me slow.

844
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:18,204
I just gotta watch what
Bennett does to ya.

845
00:51:19,372 --> 00:51:21,941
- It's not gonna be
that easy, Pierce.

846
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:23,209
- You should never
draw down on somebody

847
00:51:23,209 --> 00:51:24,577
unless you're gonna shoot 'em.

848
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:27,580
Didn't nobody teach you that?

849
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:31,217
(groaning)

850
00:51:37,223 --> 00:51:41,061
(choking and gagging)

851
00:51:46,766 --> 00:51:48,201
- Well, my dear, it looks as if

852
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:50,303
being dead's the answer
to your problems.

853
00:51:53,973 --> 00:51:55,575
- Don't think so, my dear.

854
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,011
Uh-uh-uh.

855
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:02,982
- Pierce!

856
00:52:04,284 --> 00:52:06,386
I'm gonna fire that bastard!

857
00:52:22,902 --> 00:52:24,137
- Looks like
something around here

858
00:52:24,137 --> 00:52:26,172
doesn't give a damn
about your money.

859
00:52:26,172 --> 00:52:28,408
- Seems like it runs
in the fucking family.

860
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:34,814
(dramatic music)

861
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,692
(gun fires)

862
00:52:56,236 --> 00:52:59,205
(suspenseful music)

863
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:01,808
(grunting)

864
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:11,384
- Hey Bennett,

865
00:53:11,384 --> 00:53:13,586
I owe you a bullet.

866
00:53:13,586 --> 00:53:15,588
Where do you think
I should put it?

867
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:16,956
In here?

868
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:19,526
- I'm really sweatin', babe.

869
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:42,582
I've always dreamed
of a church wedding.

870
00:53:47,086 --> 00:53:48,621
- All secured?

871
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:50,356
- No problem.

872
00:53:50,356 --> 00:53:52,559
I guess you gotta trust
somebody sometime, huh.

873
00:53:54,794 --> 00:53:57,263
(thunder rumbling)

874
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:07,774
- Hey.

875
00:54:07,774 --> 00:54:09,742
Take it easy.

876
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:11,010
- How do we look?

877
00:54:12,512 --> 00:54:16,349
- Naw, there's not time to
hook everything back up.

878
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:17,617
- Yep.

879
00:54:17,617 --> 00:54:18,818
I figured.

880
00:54:21,087 --> 00:54:22,388
- Hey, um...

881
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:26,426
If I don't make it back...

882
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:30,430
I'm gonna get the truck.

883
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,664
- Okay.

884
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:33,199
Listen, what about your

885
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:36,302
new boyfriend in there?

886
00:54:36,302 --> 00:54:37,804
Mr. Martense.

887
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,841
- If he does anything
stupid, kill him.

888
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:47,447
- Well, okay.

889
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,901
(dramatic pipe organ music)

890
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:18,678
- Will you say one
for me, Father?

891
00:55:18,678 --> 00:55:20,813
He was a lovely lad.

892
00:55:20,813 --> 00:55:23,483
Loved his mother,
sent her flowers.

893
00:55:24,684 --> 00:55:27,787
He was nice to go fish.

894
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:29,188
- [John] Lay off.

895
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,359
- I think the father
understands me now.

896
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,294
You don't.

897
00:55:34,294 --> 00:55:36,462
- [Beth] Doc, where's Katherine?

898
00:55:36,462 --> 00:55:38,298
- She'll be back.

899
00:55:39,432 --> 00:55:40,934
I have to have the gun.

900
00:55:43,136 --> 00:55:44,437
- Now, this son of a bitch

901
00:55:44,437 --> 00:55:46,372
needs watchin' all the time.

902
00:55:46,372 --> 00:55:47,307
- I know.

903
00:55:47,307 --> 00:55:48,875
- I don't trust you, do I?

904
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:51,244
I wonder why.

905
00:55:58,785 --> 00:56:00,486
- Thanks for the light.

906
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:09,963
(dramatic music)

907
00:56:12,065 --> 00:56:15,101
(ominous music)

908
00:56:25,478 --> 00:56:28,214
(thunder rumbling)

909
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:41,160
- Poor Father.

910
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,097
All that planning,
all that construction,

911
00:56:44,097 --> 00:56:45,965
and you guard your...

912
00:56:45,965 --> 00:56:47,667
- [John] Can I borrow the plan?

913
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,439
- No, it's not, Martense.

914
00:56:53,439 --> 00:56:55,308
And I'll you what you are.

915
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:58,211
You are nothing but
an incompetent faggot,

916
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:01,047
who's gonna be strung
up by his nostrils,

917
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:03,182
have his balls ripped off -

918
00:57:22,668 --> 00:57:26,339
(engine turning over)

919
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:28,941
(dramatic music)

920
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,712
(thunder rumbles)

921
00:57:44,624 --> 00:57:46,793
- I need a drink.

922
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:04,877
Can I trust you?

923
00:58:07,246 --> 00:58:08,915
- I don't know.

924
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:11,017
I just might lose control.

925
00:58:11,017 --> 00:58:13,219
- I got enough for both of us.

926
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:17,723
- Hey Doc.

927
00:58:22,528 --> 00:58:24,030
Can I steal your lighter?

928
00:58:37,243 --> 00:58:38,978
- You stand way over there,

929
00:58:38,978 --> 00:58:41,514
how are you gonna find
out what I taste like?

930
00:58:43,516 --> 00:58:45,618
(coughing)

931
00:58:49,021 --> 00:58:50,156
- Ah.

932
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:08,975
Forgive me, Father,

933
00:59:08,975 --> 00:59:10,109
I've sinned.

934
00:59:15,148 --> 00:59:16,415
Jesus.

935
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,584
Well...

936
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:28,828
- I thought I'd be
afraid, but I'm not.

937
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:35,468
(ominous music)

938
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,778
I knew we'd be brought together.

939
00:59:46,946 --> 00:59:49,549
- I heard you pray
for me to come.

940
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:53,252
- So I can make
amends to my God.

941
00:59:54,287 --> 00:59:56,589
- You called me Satan.

942
00:59:58,724 --> 01:00:00,927
- Because that's
who you must be.

943
01:00:03,095 --> 01:00:05,198
In the name of the Father,

944
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:07,433
when John Martense
sits in my chapel

945
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:08,434
as your son,

946
01:00:08,434 --> 01:00:10,136
and of the son,

947
01:00:10,136 --> 01:00:13,139
and Mr. Bennett is
here as his messenger

948
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:15,041
and of the Holy Spirit.

949
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:24,684
I am prepared to
sacrifice myself.

950
01:00:28,888 --> 01:00:32,091
Would you consider
sparing the others

951
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:34,093
of this parish,

952
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:36,862
and taking my soul as
your ultimate victory?

953
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:43,169
Will you see your
martyrs assured a place

954
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:46,339
at the right hand of God,

955
01:00:46,339 --> 01:00:51,110
and though I walk
through he valley

956
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,011
of the shadow of death,

957
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:53,813
I will fear no evil...

958
01:01:03,356 --> 01:01:04,590
- Thank you.

959
01:01:05,891 --> 01:01:07,593
This will be so good.

960
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:22,074
(dramatic music)

961
01:01:28,314 --> 01:01:30,182
Would you mind?

962
01:01:37,123 --> 01:01:40,192
- Isn't it romantic?

963
01:01:40,192 --> 01:01:41,594
Huh?

964
01:01:41,594 --> 01:01:42,828
All right, lover boy,

965
01:01:42,828 --> 01:01:44,463
let's see if you
can use a shovel.

966
01:01:51,304 --> 01:01:52,805
(knocking)

967
01:01:54,507 --> 01:01:55,908
- Father?

968
01:02:08,354 --> 01:02:10,923
Goddamn Martense.

969
01:02:12,525 --> 01:02:15,094
You son of a bitch.

970
01:02:15,094 --> 01:02:17,697
(laughing)

971
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:26,605
Oh, sweet Jesus.

972
01:02:27,673 --> 01:02:29,475
(screaming)

973
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:33,813
- [Bennett] Try not
to cut your foot off.

974
01:02:35,648 --> 01:02:37,249
- [John] If that
thing comes back up,

975
01:02:37,249 --> 01:02:39,385
I'm dragging you down
with me, Bennett.

976
01:02:41,187 --> 01:02:42,855
- [Bennett] You've
got influence.

977
01:02:44,123 --> 01:02:46,592
- [John] What do you
mean I got influence?

978
01:02:46,592 --> 01:02:48,861
- You got the birth
mark on your shoulder.

979
01:02:52,298 --> 01:02:54,600
- Yeah, how the
fuck do you know?

980
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,402
- The good Father told me.

981
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,638
The Martense brand.

982
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:05,277
(thunder rumbling)

983
01:03:41,046 --> 01:03:43,883
- Oh my, baby's really tough.

984
01:03:43,883 --> 01:03:45,151
Come on.

985
01:03:59,265 --> 01:04:01,400
God, you must be a lousy lay.

986
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:03,602
No energy.

987
01:04:30,362 --> 01:04:31,864
- Forget it babe,

988
01:04:31,864 --> 01:04:34,500
you don't have the guts
to really shoot somebody.

989
01:04:37,403 --> 01:04:38,737
- You're right.

990
01:04:48,447 --> 01:04:50,216
- [Bennett] What the...

991
01:04:50,216 --> 01:04:52,384
(screaming)

992
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:57,323
(dramatic music)

993
01:05:00,326 --> 01:05:02,928
(exploding)

994
01:05:03,996 --> 01:05:06,999
(dramatic music)

995
01:05:24,984 --> 01:05:25,784
- [Doctor] Katherine.

996
01:05:25,784 --> 01:05:27,019
- [Katherine] Oh Doc.

997
01:05:27,019 --> 01:05:28,287
- [Doctor] It's here,
it's here somewhere.

998
01:05:28,287 --> 01:05:29,855
- [Katherine] Oh Doc, no.

999
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,990
- [Doctor] It's here.

1000
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:32,458
- [Katherine] No.

1001
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:35,427
- No, don't even try.

1002
01:05:35,427 --> 01:05:37,429
Go, go go.

1003
01:05:37,429 --> 01:05:38,697
- [Katherine] Doc, I said no.

1004
01:05:38,697 --> 01:05:39,632
- Finish it!

1005
01:05:39,632 --> 01:05:41,233
(screaming)

1006
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:42,902
Katherine!

1007
01:05:45,304 --> 01:05:46,572
Katherine.

1008
01:05:51,443 --> 01:05:54,480
(ominous music)

1009
01:06:50,836 --> 01:06:51,971
- You're finally gonna be

1010
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:54,006
of some fucking use, my dear.

1011
01:06:54,974 --> 01:06:57,042
- The grave was empty, Bennett.

1012
01:06:57,042 --> 01:06:58,544
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1013
01:06:58,544 --> 01:07:00,179
- The crypt.

1014
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:02,481
Your dear father told me.

1015
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:03,682
Go on.

1016
01:07:03,682 --> 01:07:04,750
Let's go.

1017
01:07:16,228 --> 01:07:18,764
(yelling)

1018
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:27,539
(ominous music)

1019
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:36,115
- [John] Oh shit.

1020
01:07:36,115 --> 01:07:38,150
(groaning)

1021
01:07:41,553 --> 01:07:44,590
- Fucking disgusting.

1022
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:45,591
Look.

1023
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,629
Look at that!

1024
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:52,297
Look at your shoulders.

1025
01:07:52,297 --> 01:07:53,932
He's one of you.

1026
01:07:53,932 --> 01:07:56,201
Martense!

1027
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:58,537
- What the hell's goin' on here?

1028
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:00,406
- It's your family reunion.

1029
01:08:01,573 --> 01:08:02,875
Dad ran away as a kid

1030
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:05,244
so he wouldn't be
eaten for breakfast.

1031
01:08:05,244 --> 01:08:07,446
Your family tree
is rotten, my dear.

1032
01:08:10,482 --> 01:08:12,084
- [Demon] We are Martense.

1033
01:08:16,155 --> 01:08:18,524
If you fight, the
pain will be worse.

1034
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:21,960
- I'm guessing you
don't have your gun.

1035
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:23,829
- If I had my fucking gun

1036
01:08:23,829 --> 01:08:26,098
would I be lying here like this?

1037
01:08:26,098 --> 01:08:27,366
Why don't you do
something about it?

1038
01:08:27,366 --> 01:08:28,233
You're one of them.

1039
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:29,535
- [John] No I ain't.

1040
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:34,406
- [Bennett] More money as
a fucking maternity bed.

1041
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:35,974
- They wanna tear her baby out.

1042
01:08:37,142 --> 01:08:39,011
- Your young will
feed our young.

1043
01:08:39,011 --> 01:08:42,214
Your blood will be our blood.

1044
01:08:42,214 --> 01:08:43,816
- Don't let them do it.

1045
01:08:43,816 --> 01:08:44,717
For God sake.

1046
01:08:46,552 --> 01:08:48,587
- Get back, you ugly
sons of bitches.

1047
01:08:54,026 --> 01:08:54,560
Come on.

1048
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,227
Back.

1049
01:08:55,227 --> 01:08:56,395
Back it off.

1050
01:08:56,395 --> 01:08:57,963
- Put the fucking arm out!

1051
01:08:57,963 --> 01:08:59,298
They're ripping up my money.

1052
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:01,600
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1053
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,534
Come on.

1054
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:04,436
Get back, get back, get back.

1055
01:09:30,662 --> 01:09:33,832
(ominous music)

1056
01:09:41,073 --> 01:09:43,308
(growling)

1057
01:09:47,212 --> 01:09:49,581
(coughing)

1058
01:10:01,794 --> 01:10:04,763
(sobbing)

1059
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:09,568
- Get up here.

1060
01:10:09,568 --> 01:10:11,270
Let's go, let's go.

1061
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:15,174
(suspenseful music)

1062
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:42,167
(dramatic music)

1063
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:13,699
Thanks for the light, Doc.

1064
01:11:19,004 --> 01:11:22,908
(dramatic music)

1065
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:45,998
(growling)

1066
01:11:51,837 --> 01:11:55,240
(dramatic music)

1067
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:57,936
- Hell fire, just
like bull said.

1068
01:13:00,872 --> 01:13:02,174
- My God.

1069
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:05,177
- [Voiceover] As
Leffert's Corner's burned,

1070
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:06,244
all I could think about

1071
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:08,280
was who I might be inside.

1072
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,416
The killer or something worse.

1073
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:13,452
Had I really come home?

1074
01:13:13,452 --> 01:13:16,021
That's what I'm living with now.

1075
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:17,389
I know my name,

1076
01:13:17,389 --> 01:13:19,658
but I don't know who I am,

1077
01:13:19,658 --> 01:13:21,893
and until I find that out,

1078
01:13:21,893 --> 01:13:24,863
my prison sentence
goes on for life.

1079
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:28,333
(ominous music)

1080
01:13:31,837 --> 01:13:35,407
(dramatic music)
