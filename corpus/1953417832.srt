2
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,530
Don't tell me your kung fu is good

3
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:31,960
that your master is amazing

4
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,430
that your style is profound

5
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,030
Kung fu

6
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:38,030
two characters

7
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
one horizontal, one vertical

8
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,230
Those who are wrong...

9
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,730
fall down.

10
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,200
Only the one left standing in the end is right.

11
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,960
Isn't that right?

12
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,630
I'm from Foshan in Guangdong close to the South China Sea.

13
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,330
My father was Yip Oido.

14
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,330
He operated a North-South trade company on Bonham Strand West in Hong Kong.

15
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,130
When the Yip clan was in Foshan, people called us the Peide Village Yips.

16
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,760
They also said

17
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,830
all of Peide Village was ours.

18
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,630
Before I was 40 years old, I never worried about making a living.

19
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,900
I depended on the wealth that my forefathers passed on to me.

20
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,730
My only passion was...

21
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,730
When I was 7 years old, I studied martial arts.

22
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:53,730
My teacher was Chan Wah Shun.

23
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,560
Foshan Wing Chun was started by Master Leung Jan.

24
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,960
I suppose that makes me part of the 3rd generation.

25
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,200
When my master took me in, he was already 70 years old.

26
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,700
The day I formally became his student

27
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,300
he personally gave me my sash.

28
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,760
This sash represents your school and your master.

29
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,700
One's sash is one's honor.

30
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,630
Wearing this sash signifies someone who trains in the martial arts.

31
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:18,600
From now on, you will rely on this honor to conduct yourself.

32
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:19,500
Ready stance!

33
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,500
One's sash, one's honor.

34
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,160
I lived through the Guangxu Emperor (1875-1908)

35
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:25,660
The Last Emperor (1909-1911), the Republican Government, the Northern Expedition (1926-1928)

36
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,500
The Resistance against the Japanese, and the Chinese Civil War.

37
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,360
In the end, I arrived in Hong Kong.

38
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:31,130
I was able to endure all of this

39
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,130
by relying on those words.

40
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,400
My wife is Cheung Wing Sing.

41
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,400
She is a descendant of the former Qing Foreign Affairs Minister Zhang Yinhuan.

42
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,900
In general, she doesn't speak much.

43
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:47,730
She says that words can sometimes hurt people.

44
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:51,430
As for our relationship, the silent defeat the loud.

45
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,060
She likes listening to music.

46
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:25,100
Whenever there was a social event, I took her to the Golden Pavilion.

47
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:27,300
In those days, things were still pretty conservative.

48
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,400
It was very rare for ladies from respectable families to go to the brothels to listen to music.

49
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,130
She went anyway and didn't care what anybody said.

50
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,960
Whenever I went out at night

51
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,960
she would light the lamp by the front door

52
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:16,030
and wait for me to come back, and only then put it out.

53
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,260
If my life had four seasons

54
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,060
everything before 40 years old would be spring.

55
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,330
Foshan, Guangdong

56
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,230
The Chen Jitang period.

57
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,430
It was supposed to be a time of peace.

58
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,860
In those days, men would often come to the brothels to have fun.

59
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,530
The most famous playground in Guangzhou was Chen Tang's "Forgotten Goblet."

60
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,260
The most popular one in Foshan was Ying Shazui's "Republican Pavilion."

61
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,400
The inside was completely covered in gold.

62
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:32,400
So everybody called it the "Golden Pavilion."

63
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:35,260
It was the first brothel in all of Guangdong to have an elevator.

64
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,260
It became known as the place where princes enter but only beggars leave.

65
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,100
You could easily end up blowing a thousand gold pieces there.

66
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,100
It was where my kung fu brothers would often hang out.

67
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,930
In that world, there are always ordinary men.

68
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,960
But among them, there are many martial arts experts who don't reveal themselves.

69
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,200
Normal people see the Golden Pavilion as a place of ecstasy.

70
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,460
But in fact, it is a place of heroes.

71
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,330
In this life

72
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:45,660
I've only accomplished three things:

73
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:48,900
I merged the Xingyi and Bagua school

74
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,730
took in my big kung fu brother's students

75
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,500
and headed the affairs of the Chinese Martial Artists Association

76
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,730
which unified the Tongbei, Paochui, Tai Chi

77
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:02,230
Yanqing, and scores of other schools.

78
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,630
Finally

79
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:07,900
I gathered the skills of the Northern styles and passed them down in the South.

80
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:09,900
In 1930

81
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,730
the Two Factories National Skills School was established.

82
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,730
The Five Tigers will come down to Jiangnan

83
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,930
just as Master Li Renchao and I have decided

84
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,860
while sitting here in the Golden Pavilion.

85
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,860
I'm old now.

86
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:23,860
It's time for a new person to come forward.

87
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,960
I already had a retirement party in the North.

88
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:35,400
This time, I'm having another one here for the Mengjing Martial Arts Association.

89
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,500
This was so I could say farewell to my old Southern brothers and comrades.

90
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,300
In the Northeast, my best student Ma San is my heir in the North.

91
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,660
He has taken in my students.

92
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,660
Ladies and gentlemen, please look after him.

93
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,060
Originally

94
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,760
I still wanted to do one more thing

95
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:06,260
and that was to spread the Southern styles into the North.

96
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,930
Unfortunately, I don't have any more time.

97
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,130
Here at my retirement party

98
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:16,130
with my heir from the North

99
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I am looking for a Southern style martial artist to be my Southern heir.

100
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,930
Of course, that person has to win everyone's approval first.

101
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,530
Choose someone.

102
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,700
Is that all you got?

103
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,700
And yet you dare say you can challenge the Old Man?

104
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Let's finish this.

105
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,300
Attack me all at once!
Take him out!

106
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,130
At the Old Man's retirement party in the North

107
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,560
I was chosen to be his heir.

108
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,160
"If you want to pray to Buddha in the temple"
"you have to first pass through the front gate."

109
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,930
If you want to see the true Buddha

110
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,260
You'll have to get by me, Ma San.

111
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,900
I think I'm qualified to represent Guangdong martial arts.

112
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,660
As for the different schools

113
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,260
the Southern style has the Hung, Lau, Choi, Lei, and Mok.

114
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:54,260
As for seniority

115
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:56,030
all those sitting here are the elder generation.

116
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:58,200
They aren't the heads of their lineages but just the head of their schools.

117
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,660
I haven't even gotten around to me.

118
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:03,800
This is a matter of honor for the Two Factories National Skills Association.

119
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,430
We are men from Guangdong.

120
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,430
Although people say that all we do is play with our abacuses all day

121
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:10,000
when we really act, who hasn't been afraid?

122
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,560
Yeah, who are we afraid of?

123
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,430
Today someone has come here to challenge us.

124
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:14,960
We can't pretend to be helpless!

125
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,100
Do you agree or no?
Brother Shou is right!

126
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,100
You are the chosen one!

127
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,560
Tomorrow I will take our children to my parent's home.

128
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,560
So you don't have to worry.

129
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,930
When men pass the age of 40

130
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:02,930
they want to do things they are confident in.

131
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,200
I will wait. And when this is all over

132
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,860
come get me.

133
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,660
Do you know why

134
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,460
a sword has a scabbard?

135
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,860
Because a sword's true purpose

136
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,700
is not to kill

137
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,500
but to be hidden.

138
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,500
Your sword is too sharp.

139
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,500
Keep it well-hidden in your scabbard.

140
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,900
My scabbard

141
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,900
is you my master.

142
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,430
When you are around

143
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,000
I cannot start trouble.

144
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,160
I will not be that for you.

145
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,230
Make a name for yourself again after 10 years.

146
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:51,230
Leave Foshan now.

147
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:53,460
If you miss the train,

148
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,160
I will cut off your legs!

149
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,530
Stop the carriage!

150
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,960
Please friends, let us through.

151
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:37,060
Sorry, the Foshan Jingwu Association has rules.

152
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:38,360
Anyone carrying weapons

153
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:40,360
cannot enter the street.

154
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,530
Do you have any idea who is sitting in this carriage?

155
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:46,260
Call out the disciples of the Gong family!

156
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,030
Lady Er, please come in.

157
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,730
We must put a stop to this immediately.

158
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,460
Win or lose, this isn't good for us.

159
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:56,860
Father has never lost his whole life.

160
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,460
How can you speak of losing?

161
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,560
If we wins then what?

162
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:03,460
It will make people say he bullies the weak.

163
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,760
What about the difference in seniority?

164
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,060
Where's my father?

165
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,260
Kung fu Brother!

166
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,300
I, Baosen, have come to see you.

167
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,400
The Northeast is so large

168
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,630
but yet it cannot accommodate you.

169
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,130
You had to come to Foshan?

170
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,130
Get up!

171
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,500
I have come to take you back.

172
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,000
Go back?

173
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,000
Can I go back?

174
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,360
The Northeast

175
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:38,930
is part of Japan now

176
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,760
under the banner of the rising sun.

177
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,460
Can they accommodate me, this ghost?

178
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,560
It is not time yet.

179
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,560
This much stew

180
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,560
must be exhausting.

181
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,100
This isn't stew.

182
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,430
This is snake soup.

183
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,460
Isn't snake soup a winter dish?

184
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,200
It is a decades-long dish.

185
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,300
How many decades?

186
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,060
Year of the Snake

187
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,560
That's when you left the Northeast.

188
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,200
When making soup

189
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,660
you have to pay pay attention to the fire.

190
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,660
If you take something off the fire before it's ready

191
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,860
nobody wants it.

192
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,960
If you keep it in the fire too long

193
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,860
things get burnt.

194
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,060
How we conduct ourselves is the same.

195
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,730
Go back!

196
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm waiting for this furnace

197
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,530
to accept this piece of firewood

198
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,960
only then will I go back.

199
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,530
Things done quietly get done well.

200
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,530
Things that attract attention are difficult to complete.

201
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,130
We are both getting old.

202
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,830
It hasn't been easy for you being so famous.

203
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,930
Swinging your fists and waving your arms with the younger generation is not a good idea.

204
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,360
If you force things

205
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,700
it ruins the flavor.

206
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,930
I don't want to be a hero.

207
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,630
I just want to create the circumstances for one to emerge.

208
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,660
This furnace now

209
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,200
needs this new piece of firewood.

210
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,360
When you were with our Northern brothers

211
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:50,360
they all disapproved of this competition.

212
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,100
To bring how much honor to the heir?

213
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,100
This Yip guy doesn't appreciate the honor bestowed on him.

214
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,630
We also cannot break our own rules.

215
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,300
Don't think so superficially like them.

216
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,960
Old men would die to protect those rules.

217
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,930
New men must step forward.

218
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,100
Yip Man has the right stuff.

219
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,660
I will see if he can rise to the occasion.

220
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,630
The Gong family has never lost.

221
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,660
You are here again.

222
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,800
What does he have to rely on to rise to the occasion?

223
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,630
Your temperament

224
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:29,100
is just like mine when I was young.

225
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:31,600
In my eyes there was only victory or defeat.

226
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,430
There was no room for feelings or human relations.

227
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,900
If people want to see far into the distance

228
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,000
they climb a mountain

229
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,730
to broaden their perspective.

230
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,130
But if a person cannot see

231
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,130
the goodness in people.

232
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:50,130
Nor see the wisdom of people

233
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,130
there can be no kindness in his or her heart.

234
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,300
Our family's skills are high.

235
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,300
But we do not produce immoral people.

236
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,600
Father!

237
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,060
You brought your daughter to roam around in a brothel. What kind of Buddhist teaching is this?

238
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,000
This is a worldly matter.

239
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,900
If you don't look at him, he will disappear.

240
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,530
Take a look. There's no harm in doing so.

241
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,400
When I first came to the Golden Pavilion

242
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,630
you weren't even born.

243
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,800
In a flash

244
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,800
20 years have passed.

245
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,600
People live this life

246
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:09,830
and their skills carry on into the next.

247
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,930
Some come out into the spotlight and become famous

248
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:15,100
while some remain in the background and perfect their inner nature.

249
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,300
They are both a product of their times.

250
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,760
This time I am forced come down.

251
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,100
I want to seek the end.

252
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,560
I want you to see

253
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,400
how your father will step down.

254
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,800
Ever since you were little

255
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:35,030
you grew up watching me fight others.

256
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,200
This is the last time.

257
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,960
You have chosen who you are close with.

258
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,960
The affairs of the martial arts world

259
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,700
no longer concern you anymore.

260
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,700
Find a good husband.

261
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:49,530
Live a peaceful life.

262
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:52,100
That is the ultimate filial piety.

263
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,530
Master Yip!

264
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:08,460
In this world, there are many ordinary men.

265
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:10,860
Today is the day you rise to the top!

266
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,730
We and the employees of this fine establishment

267
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:15,730
have all come to wish you luck!

268
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:17,460
This is all too much, Uncle Deng

269
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,500
Don't mention it.

270
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,800
And you don't have to be so damn polite!

271
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:23,100
After you!

272
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,200
Brother Yip

273
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,830
A few of us juniors representing all the ladies have come to congratulate you.

274
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:38,260
My what an impressive lineup.

275
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:40,000
Sister San

276
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,160
is the head of the Jing and Renli schools.

277
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,830
She knows a little Bagua.

278
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,800
She wants to give you a few pointers.

279
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,160
After you!

280
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,160
Bagua techniques come from swordplay.

281
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,600
Single-turning palm is a single sword.

282
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,000
Double-turning palm is a pair of swords.

283
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,860
As for footwork, one step opens, the next closes.

284
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,300
There are 64 transformations.

285
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:22,100
To master this art, you need to attack quickly.

286
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,500
Sister San, you're going easy on me.

287
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,460
You haven't used the "Temple Breaking" technique.

288
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,330
I've done it countless times.

289
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:56,730
It's nothing special.

290
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:58,200
Mr. Yip

291
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:00,200
Bagua can be brutal.

292
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,200
Be careful.

293
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,130
Thank you!

294
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,130
Mr. Yip

295
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:19,130
Today is a happy day.

296
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:24,160
We, representing the accountant, congratulate you.

297
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,630
Xingyi was bestowed upon General Yue Fei who became its founder.

298
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,360
The so-called "stripped spear" became a fist.

299
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:38,960
Drill!

300
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:40,300
Chop!

301
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:41,700
Wipe!

302
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,200
Cannon!

303
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,060
Destruction!

304
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,000
Wing Chun's "Listening Bridge"? Now that's good kung fu!

305
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,600
Your "Half-step Destruction Punch" is also pretty amazing.

306
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,200
Mr. Yip

307
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:37,200
Exchanging hands is like climbing a mountain

308
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,330
one step at a time; day by day.

309
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:42,000
Xingyi is powerful.

310
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,800
Never underestimate your enemy.

311
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:45,630
I want to experience a high mountain.

312
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,330
Sounds like fun!

313
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,260
Master Yip

314
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,460
It should be my turn now.

315
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:07,500
Brother Yong. How are you going to congratulate me?

316
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,630
With a bunch of firecrackers.

317
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,160
The Fendingcun technique?

318
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:43,160
Hung Gar right?

319
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,630
I'm a jack of all trades!

320
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,800
You really are a jack of all trades.

321
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:00,030
So how is my mixed style?

322
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,030
As long as it works, right?

323
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,430
The Gong family has 64 Hands, 1000 Changes, 10,000 Transformations.

324
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,230
Your Wing Chun only has 3 techniques:

325
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:11,400
Tan, Bong, Fuk

326
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:13,000
How can you hit anything?

327
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,000
Three techniques were enough to deal with you.

328
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,800
Brother Yong

329
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:59,160
Your firecrackers weren't so loud.

330
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,560
You think? I'm getting too old for this.

331
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,530
Fighting, I fear is for the young and strong.

332
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,530
It doesn't matter if he is a respected master or not

333
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:10,760
Be swift like the wind, shoot for the moon, and have no mercy!

334
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:12,760
You must win.

335
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,560
Thank you all, my elders, for leading the way.

336
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,430
We wish you success!

337
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:22,730
Good luck!

338
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,200
In every generation, a man of talent comes forth.

339
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,360
I am pleased to have Mr. Yip here.

340
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,060
Today is my final battle.

341
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,500
Today we will not be battling with our fists

342
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,260
but with our minds.

343
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:09,260
How about it?

344
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,200
You are all guests.

345
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,430
Your wish is our command.

346
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,430
In the year

347
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,360
the Chinese Martial Arts Association was established

348
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,600
came a man from the south.

349
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,860
He didn't speak much.

350
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,160
In his hand, he held a piece of cake.

351
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,530
He asked my great kung fu brother Li Cunyi to take it from his hands.

352
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,360
My great kung fu brother Li Cunyi didn't say anything.

353
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,430
Instead, he had him become the first chairman of the Martial Arts Association.

354
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,860
He didn't rely on his martial arts skills.

355
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,860
In other words

356
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,430
Does martial arts have a North and a South?

357
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:00,860
Does the country have a North and a South?

358
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,860
That gentleman was a man from Foshan just like all of you.

359
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,760
His name was Yip Wanbiu.

360
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,130
He was an outstanding person.

361
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,360
I never thought that after 25 years

362
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:16,230
I would meet another Mr. Yip in Foshan.

363
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,860
I would like to ask the same question from before.

364
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,730
Mr. Yip

365
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,830
Can you take this cake out of my hand?

366
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,330
Yang-style Tai Chi has a technique called "Making the Bird Not Fly."

367
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:22,600
A sparrow in one's hand cannot fly away

368
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:25,530
because it has no place to borrow power and lift off.

369
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,560
The Old Man's kung fu is still strong.

370
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,430
Mr. Yip is like a sparrow.

371
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:34,000
I think this cake

372
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,400
cannot be taken away.

373
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Actually it is the vastness of the world.

374
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:32,830
Why stop with just the North and the South.

375
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,260
Struggling to see the whole is the same as being stuck in one place.

376
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:38,460
In your eyes

377
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:41,160
this cake is a single martial arts community.

378
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:43,760
For me it is an entire world.

379
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,200
It is this so-called idea of "what is most perfect seems somehow defective."

380
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:48,560
Only by having flaws can we improve.

381
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,630
A truly useful expression.

382
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,330
As for teaching the Southern Style

383
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:54,330
why stop in the North?

384
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,030
Don't you agree?

385
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,030
Well-spoken!

386
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,430
In my whole life, I have always won.

387
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,260
I have never lost with martial arts.

388
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,160
I never imagined

389
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,400
I would lose in a battle of wits.

390
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,660
Mr. Yip

391
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,630
Today, I give you my honor.

392
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,360
In the future

393
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:30,700
when you step into the ring

394
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,400
I hope you will be like me

395
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:36,830
relying on your honor to light the lantern.

396
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,000
If you know to bear this in mind, it will reflect on you.

397
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,760
Where there is a lantern, there will always be people.

398
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,900
Gong Er, we cannot let this happen.

399
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:41,900
The Gong family has never lost.

400
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,200
If we lose

401
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:45,700
there is always another member of the Gong family to step in.

402
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,130
Take this letter to this Mr. Yip.

403
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,830
He will understand.

404
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,700
In this lifetime

405
00:36:53,741 --> 00:36:57,230
I failed to become an undisputed hero like my father.

406
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,530
Unfortunately, I never made plans for my life.

407
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,260
I've only lived for the moment.

408
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,160
Go quickly!

409
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,160
Tonight's gathering must be in accordance to the rules of the North.

410
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,060
The winning party must host it.

411
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,630
If Yip Man won't go

412
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:19,430
I won't go.

413
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,130
Go in my place.

414
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:22,700
Don't worry.

415
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,400
Someone from the Gong family will take care of it.

416
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:26,400
We have nothing to be ashamed of.

417
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,830
Let's go.

418
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,000
Gong Baosen personifies skilled martial arts.

419
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:53,060
Ma San inherited his hard power.

420
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:56,230
His daughter inherited his soft power

421
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:59,430
and is the only heir to the 64 Hands.

422
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,000
The "Hidden Flower Among the Leaves" technique

423
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,000
is impossible to defend against

424
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,160
One girl

425
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:08,160
in the Golden Pavilion can ruin the king's evening party.

426
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:11,730
She's trying to force you to come out with this challenge.

427
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:14,600
Don't underestimate her because she's a girl.

428
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,960
Remember the Four Great Prohibitions:

429
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:20,360
Buddhist monks, Taoist priests, women, and children.

430
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,100
There is nothing good about going.

431
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:23,860
"When crossing the bridge, one should not be afraid of the soldiers."

432
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,130
Everyone has put a great deal of effort in setting the scene.

433
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,130
How can I not go?

434
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,860
Three days ago

435
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:12,030
my father sat there.

436
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,160
Today

437
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,630
we become the followers.

438
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,830
After you.

439
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:23,200
What a pity... to ruin this beautiful room.

440
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,930
Kung fu is a contest of detail.

441
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:27,930
If I break anything

442
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:30,600
I will declare you the winner.

443
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,800
Mr. Yip

444
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,200
Let me show you the 64 Hands.

445
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:53,200
I hope this will help you understand:

446
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:56,030
"Beyond people are people, beyond mountains are mountains."

447
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,030
The fist cannot only have the path in front of one's eyes.

448
00:43:58,071 --> 00:43:59,500
There is no one behind one's self.

449
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,400
I hope you can figure it out.

450
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:03,400
For the longest time it has had no equal.

451
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,230
Is the bottom of the leaves enough to conceal the flower?

452
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:07,230
If we have the chance, I would like to try it again myself.

453
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,400
If you come

454
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,760
I will wait for you.

455
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,530
Take care.

456
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,860
"Hidden flower under the leaves just once",
"Leaves snowy track in my dreams again and again."

457
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
"A promise that has been made"
"Ten thousand mountains cannot keep us apart."

458
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,400
Does it fit?

459
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,560
Is Foshan that cold?

460
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,130
It looks beautiful on you.

461
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:59,530
Let's take a photograph of the entire family the day after tomorrow.

462
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:18,960
October, Foshan falls.

463
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,330
October 1938

464
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:27,060
Foshan fall to the Japanese.

465
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:30,230
The Japanese military police took over the Yip family mansion.

466
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:32,760
If my life had four seasons

467
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:37,260
for my family, we went from spring straight to winter.

468
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,360
I'll be right back.

469
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:21,360
Wait for me. I'll bring something back to eat.

470
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,160
Teach me how to make a living.

471
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:36,400
Help me get out of poverty.

472
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,360
I've never been poor in my life.

473
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:45,500
Our country is under hard times.

474
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:48,060
People are suffering.

475
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:50,860
Giving just a little won't hurt you that much.

476
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,360
I now drink water from the Pearl River.

477
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:56,830
As for Japanese rice

478
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:59,300
I can't get used to eating it.

479
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,960
I truly have nothing to eat.

480
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,830
But I still have friends.

481
00:50:02,871 --> 00:50:04,330
If each person invited me to a meal

482
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,430
I can hold out for around a year and a half.

483
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:08,430
Enjoy your meal.

484
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,100
In times like these, it isn't water that flows.

485
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:18,600
Who comes to drink Chinese wine anyway?

486
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,530
Just now there was a customer that took a girl and had a banquet.

487
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:22,030
There was some food left over.

488
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:23,260
If you don't want it go to waste

489
00:50:23,301 --> 00:50:26,360
take it home and feed your children.

490
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,900
You are too kind.

491
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:32,260
In any case, all their money is dirty money.

492
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:33,630
Whether your take it or not

493
00:50:33,671 --> 00:50:35,330
these are all people you know.

494
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:37,330
You don't have to be polite.

495
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,960
It has never been worn.

496
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:35,960
I originally planned to go to the Northeast.

497
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,260
I'm afraid that's not going to happen now.

498
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,430
If the price is right

499
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:41,900
help me sell it.

500
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,200
Hey, there is a button missing.

501
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,330
Really?

502
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,930
It must've fallen off.

503
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,500
When I was 7 years old, I learned martial arts.

504
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,000
Forty years ago

505
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:01,760
I never saw a tall mountain.

506
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:03,960
The first time I saw one

507
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:06,830
I realized the most difficult thing to overcome was just staying alive.

508
00:52:06,871 --> 00:52:08,330
In the 8th year of the War of Resistance

509
00:52:08,371 --> 00:52:09,960
I lost everything.

510
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,060
Income

511
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:11,860
Friends

512
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:14,160
Go to hell you Jap bastards!

513
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,060
Sister Yao heard from the brothel madam

514
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:24,530
that the masses want to follow a new leader.

515
00:52:24,571 --> 00:52:26,630
His name is Sun Yatsen.

516
00:52:26,671 --> 00:52:29,660
Everything he says goes.

517
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,260
The rage of the young is out of control.

518
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:35,160
All they know is glory and humiliation.

519
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,730
But Sun Yatsen won't dare to attack these Japanese devils.

520
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Kill them all!

521
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:48,160
Uncle Deng was killed in a Japanese air raid.
The Golden Pavilion was taken over by a Chinese traitor.

522
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,000
The only thing I have left is my family.

523
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,560
During 8 years of war, Lady Si and Lady Liu died one after another in the Great Famine.

524
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,430
Sit down! Don't move!

525
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,760
Where are you going? Show us your ID.

526
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:11,760
Hurry!

527
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:13,760
Take it out!

528
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,230
Where are you going? Show us your ID now!

529
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:22,000
Freeze!

530
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,100
Ma San joined the Japanese and became the president of the Shenyang Cooperation Association.

531
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,630
Do you know why I called you Ma San?

532
00:56:34,671 --> 00:56:36,460
I know.

533
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:39,430
"Words must spoken in accordance to the Three Divisions, hands must be perfected into fists."

534
00:56:39,471 --> 00:56:42,230
It's an old martial arts saying.

535
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,130
It means that there will always be someone better coming up behind you.

536
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:48,500
All things divide people into three.

537
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:51,760
You changed my name

538
00:56:51,801 --> 00:56:53,700
to remind me

539
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:55,360
to be humble

540
00:56:55,401 --> 00:56:56,930
to know my place.

541
00:56:56,971 --> 00:56:59,930
You grew up following me.

542
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,060
You consider yourself a person

543
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:06,030
who fights for the honor of this house.

544
00:57:06,071 --> 00:57:08,830
Today I want to talk to you

545
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:12,230
about my supreme skill.

546
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,100
"The Old Monkey Hangs the Seal"

547
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,600
Have you practiced it?

548
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,060
Yes

549
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:24,830
Do you know what it means?

550
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,800
I've never heard you speak of it.

551
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:30,460
"The Old Monkey Hangs the Seal" is about looking back.

552
00:57:30,501 --> 00:57:32,730
The essence is not in the hanging the seal

553
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:34,960
but in the looking back.

554
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,300
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

555
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,000
"An army does not have a constant position, water does not have a constant shape."

556
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,560
If

557
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,130
the head doesn't turn properly...

558
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,100
The Gong legacy

559
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,760
cannot be entrusted to you.

560
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
Master!

561
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,230
Who dares?

562
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,500
Let him go.

563
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,960
He's not allowed to enter my gate forever.

564
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,360
Get lost!

565
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,030
Old Man!

566
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,060
I heard that you came back.

567
00:59:56,101 --> 00:59:57,860
All our supporters from the Northeast have all arrived.

568
00:59:57,901 --> 00:59:59,630
San Ye and Wu Ye are on their way from Guannei.

569
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,800
What about Old Man Jiang?

570
01:00:00,841 --> 01:00:03,830
Uncle Jiang is inside with everybody else.

571
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,130
My lady!

572
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:14,900
All of us have been waiting for you to come up with a plan.

573
01:00:14,941 --> 01:00:17,260
The elders are on their way from Guannei.

574
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:20,460
What you want is not what I want I'm afraid.

575
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,430
Did my father have any last words or not?

576
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:27,000
He did not ask for revenge.

577
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,760
My lady!

578
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:35,500
The Old Man did not request revenge.

579
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,800
If you ask me, I also think we should kill him.

580
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,860
My hatred is boiling over.

581
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,800
He deceived our master and killed our founder.

582
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,700
Is there anything in the world that can compare to this?

583
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,060
But after some consideration

584
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,500
to be able to hit your father this time...

585
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,430
Bagua and Xingyi have been merged into one school.

586
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,500
Your kung fu brother's Xingyi kung fu is strong.

587
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:36,500
Your 64 Hands

588
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:39,530
is also what the Old Man taught you.

589
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:43,400
If the both of you each perfect your father's ultimate techniques

590
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:45,860
your skills will be complete.

591
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:49,630
Then your family's kung fu will will also be complete.

592
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,160
In addition

593
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:54,960
If you go out personally to deal with this

594
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:58,530
no matter who wins or loses

595
01:01:58,571 --> 01:02:01,060
this will make us look like fools.

596
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:03,930
From within your family

597
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,500
a student kills his teacher

598
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:09,500
a kung fu sister wants to kill her kung fu brother

599
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:14,230
wouldn't this whole thing make us all cruel and unjust monsters?

600
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,860
As for your kung fu brother

601
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:20,160
even your father could not do anything about him.

602
01:02:20,201 --> 01:02:22,630
What have you got?

603
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,130
Lady Er

604
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,530
We are all getting too old for this.

605
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,800
The elders are on their way from Guannei.

606
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,500
What they say is for your own good.

607
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,630
You should feel grateful.

608
01:02:40,671 --> 01:02:43,800
Get married quickly.

609
01:02:43,841 --> 01:02:46,760
Those were your father's final words.

610
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,160
Not to ask for revenge.

611
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:53,030
If you kill Ma San

612
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:56,800
isn't that against his wishes?

613
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,260
What my father said

614
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:02,660
breaks my heart.

615
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,330
He wants to make me live a happy life

616
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:10,160
but as long as his death is not avenged

617
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:12,400
I can never have a happy life.

618
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,060
Gentlemen, I understand what you are all saying.

619
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:24,360
My elders.

620
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:27,100
But you old men

621
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:31,230
who have fought together with my father, worked with my father, swore a pact with my father, and are closer than brothers...

622
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:33,360
My father is deads

623
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,560
Logically you are supposed to be the ones to go find Ma San.

624
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:42,000
But instead you come here and twist his words and talk utter nonsense.

625
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,460
You have all benefited from the Gong family for many years.

626
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,630
I know

627
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,560
Ma San depends on the Japanese.

628
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:54,560
He is strong-willed.

629
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,100
But the Gong family does not lack people.

630
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,460
Whether he comes today or not...

631
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,600
What does it matter if he comes or not?

632
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:11,760
He comes. You go.

633
01:04:11,801 --> 01:04:15,000
What's the difference?

634
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:21,260
Can't you find forgiveness in your heart Lady Er?

635
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:24,500
Many things are beyond our control.

636
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:27,760
It is the will of heaven!

637
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,630
Perhaps I am an instrument of the will of heaven.

638
01:04:55,930 --> 01:06:00,660
The Road to Paradise!
All the spirits are waiting for you!

639
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,000
Stop!

640
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:16,060
You can't stop! You can't stop!

641
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:18,760
Go around!

642
01:06:18,801 --> 01:06:22,100
The main road is big enough for us to each go on one side.
Go around!

643
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,060
It is the order of Ma San, the master of the Feng family

644
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:26,360
to accompany him part of the way.

645
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,600
Miss Er

646
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:30,560
Ma San's men

647
01:06:30,601 --> 01:06:32,100
are blocking the road.

648
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:33,760
They say they are here to deliver a letter of mourning.

649
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:35,460
Is this not asking for trouble?

650
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:36,460
Miss Er!

651
01:06:36,501 --> 01:06:40,260
People wait for the right time.
The right time does not wait for them.

652
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,530
Old Man Jiang!

653
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,760
Make Ma San clean his neck (so we can cut it) and wait at home for us.

654
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,500
Go!

655
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,800
Someone's coming!

656
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:33,630
Keep her from coming!

657
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:35,630
Stop her!

658
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:42,760
Everyone except Ma San get out of the way!

659
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:52,530
As a kung fu brother I respect you.

660
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:54,260
So I won't break into your house.

661
01:07:54,301 --> 01:07:56,600
But you need to have a clear head.

662
01:07:56,641 --> 01:07:59,500
You can't hide behind those curtains for the rest of your life.

663
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:02,430
Today I'm going to take back the Gong family's things.

664
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:04,260
Come out!

665
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:10,800
"You must think of your opponent's move first, before you decide your own move."

666
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:13,930
That is a fighting principle that the Old Man taught me.

667
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:15,930
It is also the basis for personal conduct.

668
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:17,200
It is unfortunate

669
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,630
that he was not so open-minded.

670
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:23,400
The Gong family's things bring money and precious things.

671
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,560
If you want to take them

672
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,760
someone from the Gong family must come get them.

673
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,630
If you allow anyone else

674
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,660
it's not going to happen.

675
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,530
Don't ask about my affairs

676
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,030
Having no news is news.

677
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,330
Find somebody else.

678
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,860
My lady

679
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,030
You pushed away a good potential husband

680
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,030
Was it worth it?

681
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,530
You had better think clearly

682
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:32,360
if you want to follow this path.

683
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:35,530
You will never be able to marry for the rest of your life.

684
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:39,530
You will never be able to pass on your martial arts, nor have children.

685
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,100
You cannot turn back.

686
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,860
Father

687
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:56,860
Do you know what women think inside their hearts?

688
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,700
If you can understand me as a woman

689
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,530
give me a sign.

690
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,730
"You must think of your opponent's move first"

691
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:47,000
"before you decide your own move."

692
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:50,630
He took advantage of our family.

693
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:06,760
I can only go forward.

694
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,900
I cannot be held back.

695
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:03,360
Hong Kong, Tai Nan Street

696
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:09,900
Master Yip, you've taught martial arts, right?

697
01:12:09,941 --> 01:12:11,160
I had to in order to eat.

698
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,630
But that was just one time.

699
01:12:12,671 --> 01:12:14,560
How can you only do that kind of thing just once?

700
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:15,700
To survive.

701
01:12:15,741 --> 01:12:17,400
You brought in all the luggage by yourself.

702
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:19,360
You're pretty strong.

703
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:20,760
Saved me a round trip.

704
01:12:20,801 --> 01:12:22,960
You know there aren't many Wing Chun practitioners in Hong Kong.

705
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:24,630
Does it have any special techniques?

706
01:12:24,671 --> 01:12:26,160
No special techniques.

707
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:27,530
Only three basic ones:

708
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,700
Tan, bong, fuk

709
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:31,700
How many forms?

710
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,460
Siu lim tao

711
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,860
Chum Kiu

712
01:12:34,901 --> 01:12:36,760
and there is also Biu Jee.

713
01:12:36,801 --> 01:12:38,060
Weapons?

714
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,760
The Bat Jam Do butterfly knives

715
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,630
and the Six and a Half Pole.

716
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,400
Anything else?

717
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:45,400
Nothing else.

718
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,230
As for bone-breaking

719
01:12:47,271 --> 01:12:48,560
neigong, lethal pressure points

720
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:50,560
it can do none of those things

721
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:51,660
As for smashing roof tiles with your head

722
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,300
or doing dragon or tiger dances

723
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:55,300
it doesn't teach any of that either.

724
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,300
Why not?

725
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,130
Teaching kung fu is not for putting on a show in the street.

726
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:03,400
So we don't teach breaking roof tiles with your head.

727
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,400
Lion dances and setting off fireworks

728
01:13:05,441 --> 01:13:07,400
is only good for things like New Year's celebrations.

729
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Furthermore, in that situation why would you need to fight so fiercely?

730
01:13:09,641 --> 01:13:11,600
Just for a red envelope of New Year's money?

731
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,730
It is undignified.

732
01:13:13,771 --> 01:13:15,730
Let me ask you one more thing.

733
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:17,860
Have you been in a real right before?

734
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:20,830
This whole street is made up of martial arts schools.

735
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:22,960
Whether or not something happens, people get challenged all the time.

736
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,730
Master Yip.

737
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,560
Do you think you can handle it?

738
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:28,360
If I said yes

739
01:13:28,401 --> 01:13:29,930
would you believe me?

740
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,400
They're gonna fight! They're gonna fight!

741
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:36,130
We've been practicing for a few years now.

742
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,860
We would like you to show you our stuff.

743
01:13:38,901 --> 01:13:39,800
Have you had lunch yet?

744
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:41,600
I just ate a bowl of fried rice.

745
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:42,830
I urge you to rest a bit.

746
01:13:42,871 --> 01:13:43,900
So it won't go to waste.

747
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:45,130
Go to waste?

748
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,400
Brother Xiong!

749
01:14:00,441 --> 01:14:02,730
Brother Xiong! Are you okay?

750
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:06,560
Not yet ready enough to go pour tea.
Pour tea?

751
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:08,360
To give respects to the master and be his student!

752
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:11,000
This bed is only temporary.

753
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,900
Master, make do with this first.

754
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,900
Please forgive the mess.

755
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,800
Do you have a hammer?

756
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:50,800
Master Yip

757
01:14:50,841 --> 01:14:54,230
My gang want to study special two-handed techniques from you.

758
01:14:54,271 --> 01:14:56,260
8 cents per person not too expensive, yeah?

759
01:14:56,301 --> 01:14:59,130
However, you'll only get the full amount when you earn our respect.

760
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:01,130
Don't try and sell us any bullshit!

761
01:15:01,171 --> 01:15:03,260
Are you cool with those two conditions?

762
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,700
Close the door.

763
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:23,760
You bastard!

764
01:15:23,801 --> 01:15:25,760
Closing the door means you're gonna fight us!

765
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:28,560
You only got two hands and two legs. How many people do you think you can take out?

766
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:30,000
You're wrong!

767
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,160
I have two hands

768
01:15:33,201 --> 01:15:34,730
but 8 legs.

769
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,760
As for how many people I can take out, that's hard to say.

770
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:39,630
But just hitting you sufficiently is more than enough.

771
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,200
"More than enough?"

772
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,160
I'm giving you that leg for free.

773
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:12,530
One leg!

774
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,130
Four legs!

775
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,830
One more leg left!

776
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,930
Do you still remember

777
01:17:15,971 --> 01:17:18,600
our oath?

778
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,830
What oath?

779
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,560
"I sincerely swear"

780
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:24,060
"to be loyal to our leader"

781
01:17:24,101 --> 01:17:25,360
"to obey the organization"

782
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:27,000
"and in order to carry out my missions"

783
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,260
"to take charge of difficult and thankless tasks"

784
01:17:28,301 --> 01:17:29,660
"and always be ready to sacrifice myself."

785
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:32,360
What kind of punishment should does who violate the oath

786
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:36,130
get?

787
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:37,630
Fuck.

788
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:42,660
Babaojie, Chaotiangung's stuff

789
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,660
can still be used in Hong Kong.

790
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:47,630
Yes but our rules still apply:

791
01:17:47,671 --> 01:17:50,060
The living can enter

792
01:17:50,101 --> 01:17:51,630
but only the dead can leave.

793
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:53,760
I'm leaving now.

794
01:17:53,801 --> 01:17:55,800
What are you gonna do about it?

795
01:17:55,841 --> 01:17:58,130
See for yourself!

796
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:14,200
New Year's Eve - Hong Kong

797
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:53,830
Mr. Yip you didn't come here just to see a doctor.

798
01:20:53,871 --> 01:20:55,830
I came to see the Gong family's 64 Hands

799
01:20:55,871 --> 01:20:57,830
one more time.

800
01:20:57,871 --> 01:20:59,530
Surely you must be joking.

801
01:20:59,571 --> 01:21:02,060
But... since you lost to me.

802
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,400
Have a seat.

803
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:13,700
If you want to pass through the door, you have to say this:

804
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:15,560
"I'm afraid"

805
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:18,330
"you will have to sing 'Killing the Four Gates' before I do"

806
01:21:18,371 --> 01:21:20,960
"only then can you eat this dumpling."

807
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:24,100
Thank you!

808
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,860
Did you know

809
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:36,500
in 1937

810
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:38,860
I had planned to go to the Northeast

811
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,260
because there is a tall mountain there.

812
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,830
I even got an overcoat.

813
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:48,160
But because of the war

814
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:49,800
I couldn't make it happen.

815
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:53,430
I couldn't keep the overcoat.

816
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,400
The only thing I have left is a single button

817
01:21:57,930 --> 01:21:59,430
that I kept as a souvenir.

818
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,530
The 64 Hands of the Gong family is a tall mountain.

819
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,600
You shouldn't let it vanish in a puff of smoke like this.

820
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:14,960
The study of martial arts has gone on for a thousand years.

821
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:16,900
As for things vanishing in a puff of smoke

822
01:22:16,941 --> 01:22:19,330
we haven't seen many cases have we?

823
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:21,900
The Gong family will always be depending on something to keep it going.

824
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:27,660
Mr. Yip

825
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,360
Martial arts can be tall but never taller than heaven.

826
01:22:30,401 --> 01:22:32,960
Our natural gifts can be deep, but never deeper than the earth.

827
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:35,000
Life is never constant

828
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:37,830
so there is no need to regret.

829
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,560
As for this button, take it and go back.

830
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,660
If we want to see something

831
01:22:42,701 --> 01:22:44,660
we end up not seeing it.

832
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,430
Say it again slowly later.

833
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:52,800
Mr. Yip

834
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,960
On New Year's Eve 10 years ago

835
01:22:55,001 --> 01:22:57,300
did you know where I was?

836
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,330
Mr. Yip

837
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:06,000
A moment.

838
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,030
The Gong family

839
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:12,330
is not a river without direction or a tree without roots.

840
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:15,900
The 64 Hands is also not what you think it is.

841
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,430
The Gong family still has people.

842
01:23:18,471 --> 01:23:20,830
I know the Gong family's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"

843
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,830
If anyone wants to come and show me

844
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:24,830
I will be here any time respectfully waiting.

845
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,360
People!

846
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:52,230
Times have changed.

847
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:54,530
Go past that whatever river, take off those whatever shoes.

848
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:58,030
There are a lot of butts wearing a lot of underwear.

849
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,360
When I came to Hong Kong.

850
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:02,360
I could only smoke this brand of cigarettes.

851
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,860
The past resides in one's hometown.

852
01:24:05,901 --> 01:24:08,830
Oh to have a puff of some genuine Guandong tobacco leaf...

853
01:24:08,871 --> 01:24:11,300
Exquisite!

854
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:16,200
You need to study "warmth", "goodness", "respect", frugality", and "consideration."

855
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:18,660
Especially "consideration."

856
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:22,230
For example, I'm smoking right now.

857
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:24,930
A person I don't know is sitting across from me.

858
01:24:24,971 --> 01:24:27,830
Out of consideration, I'll ask "would you like a smoke?"

859
01:24:27,871 --> 01:24:29,860
It doesn't matter if the other person smokes or not

860
01:24:29,901 --> 01:24:31,860
everyone still wants to be asked.

861
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:34,460
Otherwise, it's just plain rude.

862
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:37,160
Mr. Yip

863
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,060
Would you like a smoke?

864
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,700
Thank you.

865
01:24:46,741 --> 01:24:48,700
You're welcome

866
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,100
What fantastic talent!

867
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,130
Twenty years ago

868
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:38,160
we could've had an exchange.

869
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:40,160
Too bad.

870
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,660
In a martial arts school

871
01:25:46,701 --> 01:25:48,260
some people are ruled by their honor

872
01:25:48,301 --> 01:25:50,630
others by their inner feelings.

873
01:25:50,671 --> 01:25:53,430
Honor cannot be allowed to be tarnished by even a speck of dust.

874
01:25:53,471 --> 01:25:56,760
So when you spill blood, your inner feelings take it in.

875
01:25:56,801 --> 01:25:59,500
When it can't take in anymore, it leaks all over your honor.

876
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,330
This is a big reason why schools get destroyed.

877
01:26:02,371 --> 01:26:04,800
Honor invites people to smoke cigarettes.

878
01:26:04,841 --> 01:26:08,800
Inner feelings, however, can lead to murder.

879
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,700
Mr. Yip

880
01:26:10,741 --> 01:26:12,430
you arrived too late.

881
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:14,960
Don't speak of the 64 Hands ever again.

882
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:18,030
You won't see a single hand of it.

883
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:24,600
New Year's Eve - The Northeast

884
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:44,300
Killing people is hard you say?

885
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,060
My lady.

886
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,430
Things now are different from before.

887
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:52,300
The price for killing is your own life.

888
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:54,660
In Ma San's case,

889
01:26:54,701 --> 01:26:56,700
I'm not sure he is worth it.

890
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,800
The Way is the path that people walk on.

891
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:06,260
Should they go back home?

892
01:27:06,301 --> 01:27:08,260
Or keep moving on?

893
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,800
Tonight is New Year's Eve.

894
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:17,060
He will certainly come.

895
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,800
We must wait.

896
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,800
Alright.

897
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,900
We wait.

898
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:08,930
Today my lady and Ma San

899
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:10,600
have a score to settle.

900
01:31:10,641 --> 01:31:11,800
No one else

901
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:14,030
can interfere!

902
01:31:14,071 --> 01:31:17,060
Anytime.

903
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:20,260
But there's still a monkey doing tricks here.

904
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,030
Take him out!

905
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:06,300
You are more relentless than a debt collector.

906
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:09,630
It's the last day of the year. And you still can't forgive me after all this time?

907
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:12,230
The dumplings are in the pot.

908
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,800
I'm afraid you won't be able to have any.

909
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,400
For the last time

910
01:32:18,441 --> 01:32:23,230
I'm telling you that I had no intention of taking over your family or its honor.

911
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:26,160
Know when enough is enough.

912
01:32:26,201 --> 01:32:28,930
We should burn the incense

913
01:32:28,971 --> 01:32:31,500
eat the food

914
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,400
and do what we have to do.

915
01:32:33,441 --> 01:32:36,300
Heaven will rain down thunder and lightning to finish this.

916
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:39,200
The Gong family's possessions

917
01:32:39,241 --> 01:32:41,830
must be returned today.

918
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:43,530
Alright.

919
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:46,600
The possessions you speak of

920
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:48,830
are here.

921
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,600
If you want them

922
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,100
come take them!

923
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:54,160
Master!

924
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:56,460
Don't go near him!

925
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:00,400
Ma San

926
01:37:00,441 --> 01:37:02,400
Talk!

927
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,760
That day

928
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:20,460
the Old Man

929
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:23,030
spoke with me alone

930
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:25,760
about his supreme technique

931
01:37:25,801 --> 01:37:28,760
"Old Monkey Hanging the Seal"

932
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,360
He said "hanging the seal"

933
01:37:33,730 --> 01:37:37,000
meant looking back.

934
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,400
At the time

935
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:49,730
I didn't understand.

936
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,400
I also thought

937
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:57,330
he was slow.

938
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:10,360
As for the Gong family's possessions

939
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,600
I return them.

940
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,460
You said it clearly before.

941
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:19,030
They aren't yours to return.

942
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:23,030
They are mine to take myself.

943
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:25,330
My lady!

944
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:50,300
My lady!

945
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:14,700
Hong Kong - Yixiantian opens the White Rosebush Barber Shop.

946
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:27,160
I'm sorry!

947
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,630
I was thinking of my mother.

948
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,400
As for the package I sent out... did the boss get it?

949
01:40:36,441 --> 01:40:38,400
He got it.

950
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,360
There are traditions when you open a business.

951
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:45,400
It's the same everywhere.

952
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:49,100
The card I sent to Sanjiangshui.

953
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,630
You should have known how much it weighed.

954
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:56,830
Enough money for the total weight.

955
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,030
My brothers

956
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:02,060
You've got your money down here

957
01:41:02,101 --> 01:41:04,430
and your life.

958
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,530
Think about which is more important

959
01:41:07,571 --> 01:41:08,830
and choose.

960
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,130
Your eyes... there's no mistaking it!

961
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:20,760
They're just like my mother's.

962
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:22,730
Should I cut out both or just give you one?

963
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,730
Wait!

964
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:28,660
Don't you want them?

965
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,160
Sorry, my bad!

966
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:34,900
You really are

967
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,960
like an elder.

968
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:43,130
Today is the anniversary of my mother's death.

969
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:46,500
I gave two lamps to the boss to light the road.

970
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:50,260
The waters that flow around Qing mountain go on forever.

971
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:52,500
Anyway, I think I'll be going now.

972
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,800
Wait!

973
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:58,830
You also said something about tradition.

974
01:41:58,871 --> 01:42:01,200
Nobody said anything about tradition.

975
01:42:01,241 --> 01:42:02,260
What do you want?

976
01:42:02,301 --> 01:42:04,700
I stab you 3 times, you stab me three times.

977
01:42:04,741 --> 01:42:05,830
That's lame.

978
01:42:05,871 --> 01:42:08,200
Lame? That wasn't lame!

979
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:15,000
Do you see that chair over there?

980
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:17,460
In a few seconds, I'm going to tell you to go sit there.

981
01:42:17,501 --> 01:42:19,460
If I can't make you do it

982
01:42:19,501 --> 01:42:21,700
I'll give you back all your money.

983
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:24,930
You're joking

984
01:42:24,971 --> 01:42:26,360
right?

985
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,630
Brothers

986
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,000
I'm going to let this go just this one time.

987
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,700
But the next time you cross the line...

988
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:10,500
Just try it.

989
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:14,300
I'm telling you this from the bottom of my heart

990
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,360
the fire in your eyes is just like my father's.

991
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:19,530
Please! Take me as your student!

992
01:43:19,571 --> 01:43:21,330
Teach you?

993
01:43:21,371 --> 01:43:24,100
That would insult our founder's honor.

994
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,600
This is also coming from the bottom of my heart.

995
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:43,000
Fine. I'll teach you a little bit.

996
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:08,530
That year, Yixiantian accepted students.
Baji Quan entered Hong Kong.

997
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,300
The winter of 1952.

998
01:44:30,341 --> 01:44:32,530
Gong Er stopped meeting people.

999
01:44:32,571 --> 01:44:34,800
Some people said that it was because her old injuries

1000
01:44:34,841 --> 01:44:36,500
that she started to smoke opium.

1001
01:44:36,541 --> 01:44:39,300
Some people said that she become obsessed with perfecting her kung fu.

1002
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:41,500
The last time I saw her

1003
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:43,500
was in the Great South.

1004
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,530
Do you understand this play?

1005
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:28,930
I think I heard this before in Foshan.

1006
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:30,960
It called the Dream of something-something.

1007
01:45:31,001 --> 01:45:32,960
"The Dream of the Flowing Wind."

1008
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,900
A flowing wind's essence is the same as a dream.

1009
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:40,230
Some people say

1010
01:45:40,271 --> 01:45:41,930
"bamboo is better than silk"

1011
01:45:41,971 --> 01:45:43,930
"and meat is better than bamboo."

1012
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,300
Singing something

1013
01:45:46,341 --> 01:45:48,030
is far better than saying it out loud.

1014
01:45:48,071 --> 01:45:49,700
Did you ever learn acting?

1015
01:45:49,741 --> 01:45:51,700
Just superficially.

1016
01:45:58,230 --> 01:46:00,160
In those days

1017
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:04,760
Those who were stubborn

1018
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,400
would study drama.

1019
01:46:07,441 --> 01:46:09,730
I took the corner of the stage.

1020
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:12,000
There were a lot of ups and downs.

1021
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,200
When I get sick of singing "Lady General Yangmen"

1022
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:18,060
I would switch to "The Peony Pavilion."

1023
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
At that time

1024
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,730
I imagined you were in front of the stage.

1025
01:46:24,771 --> 01:46:26,730
I sang so you would look at me.

1026
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:31,000
I thought meeting that way

1027
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:33,000
would be fun.

1028
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:36,430
I imagine getting tickets for a play that good would be hard.

1029
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:39,260
You are a true fan.

1030
01:46:39,301 --> 01:46:41,100
If you want to see the play

1031
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:43,100
I'll send you a ticket.

1032
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,500
Actually, life is like a play.

1033
01:46:46,541 --> 01:46:49,630
For the past few years, it seems you have performed in many different plays.

1034
01:46:49,671 --> 01:46:53,260
Yet you have always kept the beat and brought honor to yourself and your family.

1035
01:46:53,301 --> 01:46:54,660
It's unfortunate

1036
01:46:54,701 --> 01:46:57,000
that we didn't spend more time together.

1037
01:46:57,930 --> 01:47:00,800
I never expected you to take me to see a play.

1038
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:05,260
As for my drama

1039
01:47:05,301 --> 01:47:07,700
it doesn't matter if people applaud or not

1040
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:10,330
just as long as we can stay in this moment.

1041
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:15,230
Tonight I invited you to come out

1042
01:47:15,271 --> 01:47:17,700
to finish the things I should have finished

1043
01:47:17,741 --> 01:47:20,300
and to say the things I should have said.

1044
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,960
Do you want to leave?

1045
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:28,960
In the North we have an old saying

1046
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:31,100
"People don't leave the road"

1047
01:47:31,141 --> 01:47:33,100
"tigers don't leave the mountain."

1048
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,730
These past few years

1049
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:39,530
we've all been living away from our real homes.

1050
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:42,730
I am really tired

1051
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,230
and I want to go back to my real home.

1052
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,730
Before I go

1053
01:47:49,771 --> 01:47:52,630
there is something I want to return to you.

1054
01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:11,360
As for the Sixty-four Hands Technique

1055
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:16,100
I've already forgotten it.

1056
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:25,300
I met you in the best time of my life.

1057
01:48:25,341 --> 01:48:28,100
I was lucky.

1058
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:34,530
Unfortunately, I don't have any more time.

1059
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:39,360
Remember when I told you

1060
01:48:39,401 --> 01:48:41,830
that there is nothing to regret in life?

1061
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:45,100
It's all bullshit.

1062
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:49,460
If life had no regrets

1063
01:48:49,501 --> 01:48:52,260
it would be really boring.

1064
01:48:56,730 --> 01:48:58,500
Mr. Yip

1065
01:48:58,541 --> 01:49:01,200
I want to be honest with you.

1066
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:06,360
You are in my heart of hearts.

1067
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:17,660
Telling you this shouldn't be a big deal.

1068
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:20,260
Liking someone is not a crime.

1069
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:27,430
But I can only go so far as liking you.

1070
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:34,130
I've never told anybody this.

1071
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:38,430
When I saw you tonight

1072
01:49:38,471 --> 01:49:42,000
I didn't know why I should say it.

1073
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,660
I dragged you through the good and bad in my life

1074
01:49:50,701 --> 01:49:53,960
and like a chess game, it is always going back and forth.

1075
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,060
Please take care of yourself.

1076
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:16,730
Life is like a chess game. The loser has nothing to regret.

1077
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:19,100
Originally there was no good or bad between us.

1078
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:23,530
And if there were

1079
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:26,760
it would be fate.

1080
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,500
Your father said

1081
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:39,930
"If you know to bear this in mind, it will reflect on you."

1082
01:50:39,971 --> 01:50:42,360
"Where there is a lantern, there will be people."

1083
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:46,330
I hope one day

1084
01:50:46,371 --> 01:50:49,330
I will be able to see the Gong family's Sixty-four Hands Technique again.

1085
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:56,560
My father would always say

1086
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:59,630
People who practice martial arts go through three stages:

1087
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:02,930
Seeing yourself

1088
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,330
Seeing the world

1089
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,200
Seeing all living beings

1090
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:13,060
I learned to see myself.

1091
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,530
And I think I learned to see the world.

1092
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:24,160
Unfortunately, I was never able to see all living things.

1093
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:32,460
I wasn't able to finish

1094
01:52:32,501 --> 01:52:35,060
walking down this road.

1095
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:40,800
I hope you can keep walking on it.

1096
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,560
At first glance

1097
01:53:05,601 --> 01:53:09,330
does it not look like a martial arts place?

1098
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:09,000
During the so-called Great Age

1099
01:55:09,041 --> 01:55:11,360
there was only one question:

1100
01:55:11,401 --> 01:55:14,730
To go or to stay.

1101
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:18,330
I chose to stay in my time.

1102
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:21,300
Those were the happiest times of my life.

1103
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:31,800
Gong Er died of illness in Hong Kong and kept her oath until her death.
She never married, never had children, and didn't pass on her art.

1104
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,530
Tomorrow we're going to send Miss Er's coffin back to her hometown.

1105
01:55:50,571 --> 01:55:53,130
She left this for you.

1106
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,630
Before I joined the Gong family

1107
01:55:56,671 --> 01:56:00,060
I was a head-chopping executioner.

1108
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,860
When the Republic was formed, there was need for us, so we thought we would starve.

1109
01:56:02,901 --> 01:56:06,230
During that time

1110
01:56:06,271 --> 01:56:09,700
if the Old Man hadn't taken me in

1111
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:12,930
I would still be in Chengnan getting pissed on by pigs.

1112
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:17,930
The Old Man never mistreated me.

1113
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:21,460
Instead he asked me to always follow Miss Er around and stay by her side.

1114
01:56:21,501 --> 01:56:24,600
He said I was full of hate, but I could keep it under control.

1115
01:56:24,641 --> 01:56:26,730
Later, he changed my name to

1116
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:29,360
Lucky Star

1117
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:34,400
He had hoped Miss Er

1118
01:56:34,441 --> 01:56:37,400
would always have a lucky star following her around forever.

1119
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,930
For women

1120
01:56:47,230 --> 01:56:50,060
cutting off their hair is like cutting off their head.

1121
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:55,260
When she was going to avenge the Old Man

1122
01:56:55,301 --> 01:56:57,700
she cut her hair off

1123
01:56:57,741 --> 01:57:00,100
and followed the path of never marrying and never passing on her art.

1124
01:57:00,141 --> 01:57:03,100
She was on her own.

1125
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:05,600
Now her work is done.

1126
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:13,500
This is from before her vow.

1127
01:57:13,541 --> 01:57:15,630
She burned the hair she cut

1128
01:57:15,671 --> 01:57:18,230
completely into ashes.

1129
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:21,930
The lady said

1130
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,860
she and you knew each other for half her life

1131
01:57:24,901 --> 01:57:26,860
But in actuality, you didn't know her

1132
01:57:26,901 --> 01:57:29,260
and she didn't know you

1133
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,030
but if you saw this

1134
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:39,260
you will understand her.

1135
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:45,060
Mr. Yip

1136
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:48,400
The Gong family has nobody left.

1137
01:57:48,441 --> 01:57:50,760
I give Miss Er

1138
01:57:50,801 --> 01:57:52,900
to you.

1139
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,630
The Gong Family has never lost.

1140
01:58:59,671 --> 01:59:02,130
Gong Er also never lost to anyone her whole life.

1141
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:05,830
If she had to lose

1142
01:59:05,871 --> 01:59:07,830
she would rather lose to herself.

1143
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:04,630
On the day I left Foshan

1144
02:00:04,671 --> 02:00:07,000
there was something I wanted to tell her

1145
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,260
but I didn't say it with words.

1146
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:16,060
A young man's heart has a pair of legs.
Even if divided by a river or an ocean, he always comes back.

1147
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:50,560
When I took that first step forward

1148
02:00:50,601 --> 02:00:52,660
I wrongly thought that there would be a day I would return.

1149
02:00:52,701 --> 02:00:55,530
I never suspected that it would be the last time.

1150
02:00:56,830 --> 02:00:58,730
From then on, I only looked ahead

1151
02:00:58,771 --> 02:01:01,030
for there was nothing behind me.

1152
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:04,200
Looking back there is no shore.

1153
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:11,760
Cheung Wing Sing died of illness.
Yip Man never stepped foot in Foshan again for the rest of his life.

1154
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:19,300
Alright! Ready stance!

1155
02:02:21,930 --> 02:02:23,830
Left fist! Punch!

1156
02:02:23,871 --> 02:02:25,360
Tan sao!

1157
02:02:25,401 --> 02:02:26,730
Rotate your wrist!

1158
02:02:26,771 --> 02:02:27,900
Bring it in!

1159
02:02:27,941 --> 02:02:29,730
Right fist! Punch!

1160
02:02:29,771 --> 02:02:30,600
Tan!

1161
02:02:30,641 --> 02:02:32,230
Twist the wrist!

1162
02:02:32,271 --> 02:02:34,230
Bring it in!

1163
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:46,830
Mr. Yip

1164
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:50,260
All the people we meet in the world

1165
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:53,030
we will eventually meet again, even after a long time.

1166
02:03:50,630 --> 02:03:53,330
Some people say became popular because of me

1167
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:54,800
and because of me became accepted.

1168
02:03:54,841 --> 02:03:56,800
I just hope they are right.

1169
02:03:56,841 --> 02:03:58,800
My whole life I had never put out a signboard.

1170
02:03:58,841 --> 02:04:01,330
In my opinion, martial arts is universal.

1171
02:04:01,371 --> 02:04:03,330
A thousand styles returning on a single road.

1172
02:04:03,371 --> 02:04:05,960
In the end, it is just two characters:

1173
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:07,100
One horizontal

1174
02:04:07,141 --> 02:04:09,100
one vertical.

1175
02:05:22,030 --> 02:05:38,530
Yip Man died of illness in Hong Kong. He passed the lantern on to countless others.
Thanks to him, Wing Chun flourished
and spread all over the world.

1176
02:05:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Thank you for watching. These subtitles aren't perfect, so please feel free to improve them!
