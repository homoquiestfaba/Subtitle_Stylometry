1
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,439
Good morning, baby girl.

2
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,944
Now, baby, I got to go to work.

3
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,698
So, I thought that this salt bath...

4
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,617
would help with your soreness.

5
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,480
I love you.

6
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,654
Enjoy your bath.

7
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,581
I know, mom.

8
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,960
Yeah.

9
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,757
Soon.

10
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,554
OK.

11
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,139
OK, bye.

12
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,267
- Hey! Hi.
- Hey, guys.

13
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,518
Let's go.

14
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,978
Where are we going?

15
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,187
It's a surprise.

16
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,313
I'm afraid.

17
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,357
Oh, wait, I have to get my purse.

18
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,025
We got you covered. Come on, girl.

19
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,069
No, I can't leave without my phone.

20
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,789
I am so glad you came.

21
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,542
What do you mean? You guys kidnapped me.

22
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,668
Well, you deserve it...

23
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,669
and so do I.

24
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,588
All that running around with my 2 kids.

25
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,048
How are my niece and my nephew anyway?

26
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,884
They are wonderful...

27
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,428
but you know we had
to move in with Madea.

28
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,929
Neither one of these baby daddies...

29
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,930
is paying child support.

30
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,557
Triflin'. You know.

31
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,101
It's OK. I'm doing what I gotta do.

32
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,519
That's a black woman's motto.

33
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,897
We don't always do what we want to do...

34
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,232
but we always do what we have to do.

35
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,276
You should've let me bring my purse.

36
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,069
You guys can't afford all this.

37
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,031
Lisa, we wanted to do
something special for you.

38
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,991
Will you relax? We got it.

39
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,701
Hi.

40
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,413
Hey.

41
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,749
I'm Frankie Henderson.

42
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,626
You ride my bus all the time.

43
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,793
The number 9.

44
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,420
Right.

45
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,755
Is this your gym?

46
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,591
No, I just dropped off a painting.

47
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,178
Well, it was good to see you again.

48
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,390
Look, I was just wondering...

49
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,268
would you like to go
out with me sometime?

50
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,605
I wrote my number down...

51
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,607
and I know this place maybe...

52
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,776
You are bold.

53
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,320
You're gonna ask her
out right in front of us?

54
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,447
You know we're gonna
talk about you, right?

55
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,158
Yeah, well...

56
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,785
now that I'm officially embarrassed...

57
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,621
Excuse me. I'm her sister.

58
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,957
She'll be calling you.

59
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,253
Good.

60
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,463
All right, bye.

61
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,467
Bye.

62
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,802
Lisa!

63
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,471
Looks like somebody's
got a secret admirer.

64
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,974
Oh, please. You are taking this number.

65
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,518
No, you didn't!

66
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,727
Yes, I did.

67
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,854
What did he say?

68
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,648
What could he say? He had to come clean.

69
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,859
He was married.

70
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,861
I am so sick of dating.

71
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,071
And ya'll want me to go on a date.

72
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,865
'Cause you need to.

73
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,075
You haven't been out in two years.

74
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,410
Don't worry about me.

75
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,828
Let's talk about you.

76
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,496
In less than ninety days...

77
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,081
you're gonna be marrying...

78
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,749
one of the most eligible
bachelors in Atlanta.

79
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,001
And he's rich?

80
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,627
What did you say he do again?

81
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,962
He's an investment banker.

82
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,214
Yeah, my mom introduced
me to him last year.

83
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,508
I don't even know what an
investment banker does...

84
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,928
but he must be doing it very well.

85
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,847
Living here on the 30th floor.

86
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,183
I gotta check my phone.

87
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,809
Just a second.

88
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,022
Who can that be?

89
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,316
I don't know. You better get it.

90
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,068
Oh.

91
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,862
Are you Miss Lisa Breaux?

92
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:07,946
Yes, I am.

93
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,031
May I come in?

94
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,074
Yeah, sure.

95
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,375
What's going on?

96
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,710
You...

97
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,087
are under arrest.

98
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,380
Oh...

99
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,468
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.

100
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,136
No, no. Just stop.

101
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,346
- Just enjoy it.
- Really!

102
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,349
No, really, you have to go.

103
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,809
No, no, no, no, no, you have to...

104
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,604
- Girl...
- Please stop that!

105
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,273
I should've cashed my check.

106
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,237
You have to stop this right now.

107
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,949
OK, OK. Just stop!

108
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,245
Hi, honey.

109
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,306
Hi. I am so sorry. This was...

110
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,100
this was our idea.

111
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,434
It was all your idea.

112
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,186
Oh, don't be silly.

113
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,438
- Don't be silly.
- I'm Vanessa.

114
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,066
I'm Lisa's sister. It's
really good to meet you.

115
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,359
- This is your sister?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,152
Come here. So you're
family, family, family.

117
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,196
Come here.

118
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,073
Well, hey, hey. You guys carry on.

119
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,157
Do your thing, brother.

120
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,450
All right.

121
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,911
Have a good time.

122
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,663
OK. Put the music back on.

123
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,416
No, no, no. You guys have to go.

124
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,959
Why? He said it was OK.

125
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,003
Donna, look what she got back there.

126
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,422
She don't need this. Come on!

127
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,299
Whatever.

128
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,426
I paid you for a full dance...

129
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,928
so we gonna finish at my house.

130
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,310
It was really good
spending time with you.

131
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,477
Thank you.

132
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,354
Love you. Love you too.

133
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,193
OK, bye. See you guys! Bye!

134
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,736
- Call us!
- I will! OK.

135
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,209
What you doing bringing him in my house?

136
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,543
And I've been calling you.

137
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,961
I've been calling you all day.

138
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,047
I left my phone here.

139
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,217
You love making me angry, don't you?

140
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,594
I think you do this on purpose.

141
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,971
You see how nice your life could be...

142
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,349
if you just do what I say?

143
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,603
Fix your hair.

144
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,268
Mrs. Breaux.

145
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,769
Victor.

146
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:26,895
You look fantastic.

147
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,188
Thank you.

148
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,941
Hello. Hi.

149
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,693
- You look wonderful.
- Thanks.

150
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,448
Sweetie, my darling.

151
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,202
Thank you.

152
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,789
Well, I just came...

153
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,791
from my mother-of-
the-bride dress fitting...

154
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:52,045
and the gown is gorgeous!

155
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,047
That B. Michael is a genius.

156
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,551
Sit up straight, dear.

157
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,345
What is wrong with you?

158
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,265
You're so mopey when
you should be so excited.

159
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,225
Well, I'm not, Mom.

160
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,729
I know. You just have
cold feet, that's all.

161
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:09,938
That's normal.

162
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,773
He hits me.

163
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,903
When?

164
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,989
Often.

165
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,787
Well, you must stop
doing what you're doing...

166
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,831
to make him angry.

167
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,124
What?

168
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,213
Women sometimes have
to deal with things...

169
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,797
to be comfortable.

170
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,511
Mom, listen...

171
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,554
You listen.

172
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,640
Now it's time for you to grow up.

173
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,267
Of course you're gonna marry him.

174
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,936
What else are you gonna do...

175
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,979
work in a bridal shop like your sister?

176
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,315
Now, just be a good wife.

177
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,859
Do what the man says...

178
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,362
and you won't have any problems.

179
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,030
Waiter!

180
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,699
Yes, ma'am?

181
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,494
I will have the salad
with bleu cheese...

182
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,037
and no bacon, please.

183
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,330
What would you like, darling?

184
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,334
Now, why were you stealing?

185
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,503
'Cause I was hungry.

186
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,213
What happened to your
other foster parents?

187
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,381
They don't care.

188
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,883
They didn't even know that I was gone.

189
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,718
Have a seat until I can get...

190
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,220
a representative here
from child welfare.

191
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,513
Call the next case.

192
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,807
City of Atlanta versus Mabel Simmons.

193
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,856
Madea!

194
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,608
What are you up to now?

195
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,777
She took off her house arrest bracelet.

196
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,238
You better have a good
reason for taking it off...

197
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,700
because I have a good mind
to send you to jail right now.

198
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,826
Actually, she does.

199
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,661
She takes care of my elderly father...

200
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,164
and, he was sick, and
she needed to get...

201
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,665
Oh, I don't believe that crap.

202
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,167
You don't know how to lie.

203
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,544
What kind of lawyer
don't know how to lie?

204
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:56,879
Lie and lawyer go together.

205
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,505
Lie-awyer,
lie-awyer.

206
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,507
Do you take care of his father?

207
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,842
Yes, I have to though...

208
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,052
'cause ain't nobody else
gonna take care of him.

209
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,096
That's my only brother,
and I take care...

210
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,514
of his kids when he has court...

211
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,724
and I take care of my great-niece...

212
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,267
and her children.

213
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,602
They at my house too...

214
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,896
'cause I open my house
up to anybody in need.

215
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,522
They can come to my house...

216
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:16,607
get a good meal, everything.

217
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,358
That's why I can't be tied down.

218
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,903
I have to be going to
the store and stuff.

219
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,946
I feed the homeless and help the hungry.

220
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,407
I'm going out in the
highways and by-ways

221
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,659
and doing what the lord told me to do.

222
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,286
Praise him. Thank you, Jesus.

223
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,704
Does she watch your kids?

224
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,788
She's actually really good.

225
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,081
She's a big disciplinarian though...

226
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,417
but they have a lot of respect for her.

227
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,543
Really?

228
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,546
Stand up, Nikki.

229
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,259
Mabel Simmons...

230
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,970
since you can't seem to act
like you have any sense...

231
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,472
except if you're caring for somebody...

232
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,933
meet Nikki Grady.

233
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,560
You're her new foster mother.

234
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,978
The hell I am.

235
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,438
Hell, no!

236
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,024
It's a reason why God put
a woman through menopause.

237
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,401
I'm past 60, honey.
You know what that mean?

238
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,694
Madea, calm down.

239
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,196
Ain't supposed to be
bothered with no bad kids.

240
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,322
I will kill that little girl.

241
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,823
I don't know her.

242
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,742
She might be one of them
Sandinistas or something.

243
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,743
She might be...

244
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,412
So? You ugly anyway, old lady.

245
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,790
She trying to get me the
electric chair already.

246
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,875
Either you're her foster mother...

247
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,752
or you're a prison mother.

248
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,380
I'll take the prison for 200, Alex.

249
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:22,965
Lock me up. I'd rather be...

250
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,132
in Martha Stewart's old cell...

251
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,300
fighting for my virginity...

252
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,553
than to be sitting
there dealing with this.

253
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,056
She'll be a great foster
mother, your honor.

254
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,937
This a Benz. What
kind of drugs you sell?

255
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,317
I don't sell drugs.

256
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,819
I'm a lawyer.

257
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,239
You get the drug dealers off.

258
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,908
That ain't no way to
talk to no grown person...

259
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:50,993
and stop poppin' that gum.

260
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,536
Don't tell me what to do.

261
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,831
Madea.

262
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,166
You better get her.

263
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,792
She don't know who she's talking to.

264
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,502
You better ask somebody, honey.

265
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,964
You know, the kids are doing well.

266
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,258
Yeah, and Deborah... how's she doing?

267
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,678
She's doing good, 15 months clean.

268
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,389
Good. I thought I was gonna
have to hide my purse...

269
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,683
at the family reunion,
'cause she used to steal.

270
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,393
No, you won't have to do that.

271
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,354
So, where's it gonna be this year?

272
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,689
Gonna be at Aunt Ruby's.

273
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,734
Little girl, I'm gonna
ask you one more time...

274
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,195
to stop popping that gum.

275
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,488
Whatever.

276
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:32,784
You going to Lisa's wedding?

277
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,996
Yeah, I'm going.

278
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,165
I tell you, that Vanessa's
been wearing me out...

279
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,541
asking me about I'm going.

280
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,002
Little girl, if you don't
stop popping that gum...

281
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,962
Look! If you touch me...

282
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,881
I'm gonna call 911.

283
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,258
My daughter tried that.
I hit her so hard...

284
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,260
she dialed
9-9-10.

285
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,679
You don't know me.
I'll whip an old woman.

286
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,556
What? Who the hell you talking to?

287
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,891
I'm talking to you.

288
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,894
You think I'm playing?

289
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,151
You ain't got no sense! Calm down!

290
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,903
- Calm down!
- Shut up! Shut up!

291
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,572
Now sit in that seat
and put the seat belt on.

292
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,908
You better put that
seat belt on right now!

293
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,625
What the hell is wrong
with these children today...

294
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,918
but, I set 'em straight.

295
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,128
I'm from the old school,
and I will beat...

296
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,589
the hell out of you first
and ask questions later.

297
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,967
If you don't know how to get in line...

298
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,260
I will get you in line.

299
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,303
Remind me to never leave
my kids with you again.

300
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,099
Are you ready?

301
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,726
Welcome to your wedding, darling.

302
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,938
I thought since he
proposed to you in Paris...

303
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,232
we'd give it a Parisian theme.

304
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,192
The Eiffel tower...

305
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,194
an orchestra...

306
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,530
flowers flown in from Paris.

307
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,698
The only wedding...

308
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,450
Wow, you can do all this?

309
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,079
Oh, yes, darling, I can get it done.

310
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,373
I like that one.

311
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,667
Well, this is Tomojio's design.

312
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,502
He's my favorite, as well.

313
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,797
Now, his bid is a little
on the expensive side...

314
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,299
but he is worth it.

315
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,467
We want him.

316
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,220
Good.

317
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,642
This will be the wedding
to rival all weddings.

318
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,854
I'll get Tomojio on the line...

319
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,315
and let him know you're
going with his design.

320
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,241
Madea is having a family reunion...

321
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,327
and we're going.

322
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,329
I know. I heard.

323
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,955
You know we don't fraternize, darling.

324
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,790
Mom, this is our family...

325
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:46,585
and it'll be good for
you to see your grandkids.

326
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,129
I don't want to see
those little bastards.

327
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,840
Mom! You will not talk
about my children that way.

328
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,842
I swear, Vanessa...

329
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,178
all the opportunities we afforded you...

330
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,805
you have managed to throw
every one of them away.

331
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,224
You're just like your father.

332
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,558
Because Lisa's father had money...

333
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,227
he was better than mine?

334
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,645
Your father was a musician...

335
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,063
who tried to ruin my life...

336
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,481
is what I meant.

337
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,066
Now, he threw his life away...

338
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,442
and you are doing the same.

339
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,277
You took the easy way out
and married that evil...

340
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,156
All you wanted was his money.

341
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,535
You will watch your mouth.

342
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,161
That man did everything he could...

343
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,371
for you and your sister...

344
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,207
and it wasn't easy, asking
him to take you in...

345
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,751
and you tried with all your might...

346
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,294
to destroy my marriage.

347
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,171
And now you will not talk about...

348
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,422
my late husband in that manner.

349
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,050
You are so wicked.

350
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,426
You're gonna rot in hell.

351
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,179
I vacation there.

352
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,438
Who told you you know
how to fix a lawnmower?

353
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,275
Uncle Joe, I know what
I'm doing, all right?

354
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,568
I've fixed lawnmowers before.

355
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,279
That ain't right. You
got to look here, boy.

356
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,905
Get on out of the way.

357
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,074
You got to work on the
auxiliary carburetor.

358
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,743
This is the spark plug.

359
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:02,828
You need the auxiliary...

360
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,580
This is the auxiliary carburetor...

361
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,290
and everything run through
the auxiliary carburetor...

362
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,749
going on down to the engine.

363
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,626
You see? All you need to do...

364
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,420
is tap that to get it in line.

365
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,588
See?

366
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,632
I'm 'a tell Mabel you broke it.

367
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,717
Wait now, Mr. Jones.

368
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,677
I'm tell her you did it.

369
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,222
Hey, Isaac broke your lawnmower.

370
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,891
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

371
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,100
You did. He broke it.

372
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,144
How you doin', Isaac? Good to see you.

373
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,146
How you doin', Madea?

374
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,856
What's going on, man? How you doin'?

375
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,399
Hey, Brian.

376
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,151
- How are you?
- Good, good.

377
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,112
I was sure hoping they
would lock you the hell up.

378
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,448
Only thing locked up
'round here is your bowels.

379
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,699
Now shut the hell up.

380
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,701
How you doin', Daddy?

381
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,036
Hey, Brian. Hey, uh, Tiffany...

382
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,496
How you doin'?

383
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,289
Daddy, this is not my daughter.

384
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,624
They all look alike to me.

385
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,791
Who it's for?

386
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,251
Madea is her new foster mother.

387
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,711
You're gonna have a house guest.

388
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,130
That child ain't staying here.

389
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,215
You can't stay here.

390
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,883
Go back to where you came from.

391
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,426
You can't stay in this house.

392
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,011
Bad enough you let that gal...

393
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,387
move in here with them two babies...

394
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:03,514
making all that racket...

395
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,182
all day long, now you brought her.

396
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,600
Every time I send you somewhere...

397
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,726
you come back with somethin'.

398
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,894
Take it back. We don't want it.

399
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,646
Return to sender.

400
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,481
I remember I sent you somewhere too...

401
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,815
and you came back with somethin'.

402
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:14,858
You still itchin'?

403
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,318
Yo' mama.

404
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,362
Hell. That's my mama too, ain't it?

405
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,280
Don't say that in front of this child.

406
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,323
Come in the house.

407
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,699
I'll show you where you're sleeping.

408
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,785
Daddy, you gotta stop being so mean.

409
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,120
I wish I had been mean to your mama.

410
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,705
Then I wouldn't be sitting here...

411
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,916
Iooking at you right now.

412
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,710
That's crazy as hell, all
these people in this house.

413
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,212
I'm gonna call the fire marshal.

414
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,047
That is against the law!

415
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,382
I'm gonna need some weed...

416
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,551
to be dealing with all
these people in here.

417
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,135
Babies crying every five minutes.

418
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,554
Hell!

419
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,412
How you doin'?

420
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,626
Why, thanks, I'm fine.

421
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,597
My heart's all better...

422
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,808
from you shooting me down the other day.

423
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,852
You still haven't called a brother.

424
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,565
You still have my number?

425
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,236
Yes? No?

426
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,238
Maybe?

427
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,660
What do you keep writing in that pad?

428
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:51,288
Why?

429
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,956
I'm just wondering.

430
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,917
Poetry.

431
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,043
Poetry, wow.

432
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,544
You're a poet?

433
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,922
Will you just drive
this bus, please, man?

434
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,849
You know, I like poetry too.

435
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,100
Check this out.

436
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,228
Roses are red...

437
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,772
violets are blue.

438
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,774
If you go out with me...

439
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,860
you will like me too.

440
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:26,114
A smile!

441
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,659
Ladies and gentlemen,
hallelujah, I see a smile.

442
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,161
You are so...

443
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,792
You should go out with me.

444
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,962
I know this great spot... poets.

445
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,589
Lady, please say yes so he can shut up.

446
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,299
What do you say?

447
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:45,843
I've had a really long day...

448
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,512
my feet hurt, these
pantyhose are too tight...

449
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:51,098
and I got two kids at
home waiting for me.

450
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,641
Two?

451
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,142
Yeah, two.

452
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,604
I bet he don't want to
go out now. Two kids?

453
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:00,440
Dude, she said "two
kids." Think about it.

454
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,776
- You need to shut up.
- Don't start, Tyreka.

455
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,862
I got a son.

456
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,989
Maybe we could make
this a family thing...

457
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,365
if you say yes.

458
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,368
Miss? Miss!

459
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,537
He really is a nice guy.

460
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,789
I take my son to the
park every Saturday.

461
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,791
You should bring your kids.

462
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,086
You call me, and I'll tell you where.

463
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,838
What do you say?

464
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,946
I'll think about it.

465
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,797
Good morning.

466
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:09,384
That baby's speaking to
you. Say good morning.

467
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,470
And?

468
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,350
Oh, I'm sorry. Natural reaction.

469
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,853
I was getting ready to
jump over this table here.

470
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,688
You ain't got time to eat that.

471
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,023
Bus'll be here any minute.

472
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,316
You should've been down earlier.

473
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,901
Take it to school with you.

474
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,736
I don't want to go to school.

475
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,113
You ain't got no choice.

476
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:33,075
Why you don't want to go?

477
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,202
I don't want to ride the bus.

478
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,079
Why?

479
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,331
Little girl, you better answer me.

480
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,585
Kids be mean to me.

481
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,754
They say all kind of stuff about me.

482
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,798
And what you say to them?

483
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,052
Nothin'.

484
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,679
Honey, folk gonna talk about you...

485
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,430
'til the day you die.

486
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,766
Ain't nothin' you can do.

487
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,143
Let folks talk. People talk about me.

488
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,688
Yeah. They used to call her "wide load."

489
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:06,275
Wide load. Beep.

490
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,068
That's what they used to say...

491
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,654
when she be comin'.

492
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:11,989
Honey, listen to me.

493
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,824
It ain't what people call you...

494
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,117
it's what you answer to.

495
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,161
You hear me? You remember that.

496
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,329
Come on.

497
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,330
Where you goin'?

498
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,291
To the bus. Come on.

499
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,626
I'll be right back.
Ya'll sit there and eat.

500
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:28,714
Only way to deal with a bully is...

501
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,465
to confront them face to face.

502
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,925
You understand?

503
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,260
Hold on, bus driver.

504
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:36,263
I need to talk to some of
these children on the bus.

505
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,140
Come on, little girl.

506
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,351
Get on the bus.

507
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:45,564
Listen up!

508
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,651
This here is a friend of mine...

509
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,196
and she been tellin' me
that a few of ya'll...

510
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,281

511
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,492
If I catch any one of

512
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:58,744
it's gonna be me and you, you hear me?

513
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,871
Shut up, old lady!

514
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:16,803
All my life I had to fight.

515
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,222
I loves Harpo...

516
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,183
but I'll kill him dead
'fore I let him beat me.

517
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,435
Who's Harpo?

518
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,853
Go on. Go to school.

519
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,605
Go on, sit down.

520
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,857
I'll be waiting for
you when you get off.

521
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,401
Ain't nobody gonna mess with you.

522
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:32,736
Nobody.

523
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,655
I ain't.

524
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:38,450
I'll be waiting for you at 3:00.

525
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,039
Let me see if you can do that.

526
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,084
Oh, not bad.

527
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,253
Let me check.

528
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,046
They're still open. Hey, what happened?

529
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,214
Just do it!

530
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,424
Chicken.

531
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,009
- Hey.
- Hi, guys. Hi.

532
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,886
What's going on? Hold on.

533
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,638
This is Nima.

534
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,473
- Hey, Nima.
- And this is Jonathan.

535
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,725
Hi, Jonathan. This
is my son Tre. Say hi.

536
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,770
- Hello, Tre.

537
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,772
Yes, you can. Let me tie your shoes.

538
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,066
Hold up. Just wait
right here, all right?

539
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,277
Yeah, but you gotta
be careful though, OK?

540
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,070
Go ahead. You can go with them.

541
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:16,572
Watch your brother, OK, Nima? OK.

542
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:17,906
- All right.
- All right.

543
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,672
Your kids are beautiful.

544
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,009
Thank you.

545
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,511
So is your son.

546
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:42,139
Yeah. He's funny.

547
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,141
They are a blessing, aren't they?

548
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:45,517
Yep.

549
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,894
Definitely.

550
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,104
So where's his mother?

551
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:53,108
She's married.

552
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,485
Doesn't have much time for him.

553
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,618
What about their fathers?

554
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,620
One's in jail...

555
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:07,664
and Nima's dad, he was...

556
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,750
is married.

557
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,210
He won't even see her.

558
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:16,965
Tell me about you. Your mother, father?

559
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,675
Mother and father are both dead.

560
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,802
I was an only child.

561
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,516
Like my job. Love to paint.

562
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,520
I'm a Christian.

563
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,148
Try to do the right thing.

564
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,693
OK.

565
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,904
So, you seem to be this great guy...

566
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,156
terrific dad...

567
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,700
and no woman snatched you?

568
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,747
OK, so what's the real problem?

569
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,836
Well...

570
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:54,878
Come on.

571
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,338
I guess I'm old-fashioned.

572
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,923
You know?

573
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:01,677
I like to be the chaser.

574
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,554
Oh, really?

575
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,640
Is that you, Penny?

576
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:07,641
Well, it's about time.

577
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,685
That's a shame.

578
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,478
That is a shame,

579
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:14,398
Gonna burn that little girl.

580
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:15,732
Lord have mercy.

581
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:18,861
What make people be so mean to children?

582
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:20,904
They like to make up stories.

583
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,406
Sure. OK. Bye-bye.

584
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:24,950
Didn't I tell you...

585
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,368
to come straight home from school?

586
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,536
Come here.

587
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:32,624
Where you been?

588
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,211
I had to go to my friend's house.

589
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:37,963
What friend?

590
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,381
You don't know her.

591
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,427
I want you in this house...

592
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,720
before the streetlights come on.

593
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:45,846
Do you hear me?

594
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,098
- Yeah.
- Yes, what?

595
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:49,391
Yes, ma'am.

596
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,980
How was school?

597
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,356
Good.

598
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,108
Got any homework?

599
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:02,362
I did it already.

600
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:04,490
In what?

601
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:05,949
Algebra.

602
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,242
Algebra, huh?

603
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,662
Don't do it.

604
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,998
Don't whup the girl. Don't do it, Mabel.

605
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,918
I done told you, you...

606
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,336
Hey, come here!

607
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,963
OK, OK, OK!

608
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,924
Mabel, you jiggling like jell-o.

609
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,509
Turn around here.

610
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:24,843
You stop that! You better...

611
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:26,595
Girl, look at me! Look at me.

612
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,097
Why wasn't you at school today?

613
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,225
I went to the park.

614
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:32,476
She lyin'.

615
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,186
What was you doin' in the park?

616
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:35,938
You supposed to be at the schoolhouse.

617
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,608
Little girl, I'm not
gonna ask you no more.

618
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,277
I'm not smart like the other kids.

619
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,154
I can't do that stuff.

620
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,073
Who told you that?

621
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,326
My last foster mother.

622
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,828
She told me the only thing...

623
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:53,872
I'm gonna be smart enough
to do is lay on my back.

624
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,332
Was your foster mother Jennifer?

625
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,377
I know Jennifer. I know her.
That's all she used to do.

626
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,213
Shut up, Joe. I'm trying
to talk to this child.

627
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,465
The best revenge you
can have on somebody...

628
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:05,217
that told you something like that...

629
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,677
is to prove them wrong.

630
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,262
Best revenge you can have...

631
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,429
is to kick they butt.

632
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:10,514
That's the best revenge.

633
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,141
I went to that school,
and I got your homework.

634
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:14,518
Talked to your teacher.

635
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,521
She said this is what you
have to do in the morning...

636
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,940
so go up there and get it done.

637
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,150
Can you help me with it?

638
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,827
It's algebra.

639
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,622
Honey, I don't know
nothing about that algebra.

640
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:37,708
When I was in school, we had 3 R's.

641
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:38,709
Read, write, 'rithmetic.

642
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,294
I don't know nothing about algeroe.

643
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,796
'Cause she dumb as hell.
If it ain't got no food...

644
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,839
or sugar on it...

645
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,507
she can't figure out what it is.

646
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:46,967
All she do is eat.

647
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,927
Go upstairs. I'm gonna
get you Tiffany's number.

648
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,180
That's Brian's daughter.
She'll be able to help you.

649
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,223
She's a little older than
you. She can help you.

650
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,517
Better be at school when
I tell you to go to school.

651
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:01,523
I look in the mirror

652
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,406
I don't know

653
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,909
Who's staring back at me

654
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:20,042
A soul gets lost

655
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,338
Controlled

656
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:28,300
By his lovin' in the mirror

657
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,138
The reflection

658
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:36,433
From your eyes

659
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,562
I didn't know that.

660
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:42,189
I didn't know that. Did you?

661
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,775
No. That is hilarious.

662
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:46,318
Lisa, this man is a riot.

663
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:47,778
Yes, he is.

664
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,781
So you have to tell me the
rest of the story, Carlos.

665
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:53,784
How is the wedding planning coming?

666
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,244
Great.

667
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,329
You must be so excited.

668
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:01,083
Over the moon.

669
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,421
Excuse me.

670
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:08,632
Sorry.

671
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,926
Long nights.

672
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,268
You want to dance, honey?

673
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,228
Yes.

674
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:22,604
You sure?

675
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,773
- Yeah.
- OK.

676
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:26,358
All right, y'all excuse us please?

677
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:27,484
Excuse me.

678
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,071
She'll love it.

679
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,699
They are such a lovely couple.

680
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,748
Why do you insist on embarrassing me?

681
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:44,084
I'm sorry. I'm a little tired...

682
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,127
that's all.

683
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:47,838
When I get you outta here...

684
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,047
I don't understand.

685
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:51,175
Shut up.

686
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:53,385
Can't take you anywhere.

687
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,597
Just wait.

688
00:34:58,348 --> 00:34:59,558
Just wait.

689
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:10,360
Let's not wait, Carlos.

690
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,362
Just do it now.

691
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,947
Just hit me...

692
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,741
so all your friends can see...

693
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:18,160
what kind of a man you really are.

694
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:26,126
You love to provoke me, don't you?

695
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:30,672
Why do you insist on
doing things the hard way?

696
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:32,841
You love it when I'm not myself?

697
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:36,011
You like the highs and lows of me?

698
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,641
But you always play the victim, baby.

699
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,021
I'm leaving.

700
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,527
No, you're not.

701
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,737
Baby, this dance ain't over.

702
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,991
And if you think you're
talking about leaving me...

703
00:35:58,075 --> 00:35:59,368
well...

704
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:02,120
I love you to death...

705
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,833
and I mean that.

706
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:31,191
Excuse me. Excuse me.

707
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:33,777
I'm old. Hell, I can't hold it no more.

708
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,863
All ya'll be knowin' I got to fart.

709
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,240
Sometimes it just run on out.

710
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:39,741
Gotta do what you gotta do.

711
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,076
That's right.

712
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,412
When you get to be
this age, you'll know.

713
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:44,913
Farts come free.

714
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:46,415
You be tryin' to hold it...

715
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:47,583
you mess around...

716
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:48,876
blow your eyes out tryin' to hold it.

717
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,838
I'm just playing with you here.

718
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,464
I tried to hold it one time, man...

719
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,008
I just started crampin' up...

720
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,384
'cause I was around a bunch of people...

721
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,428
on the aeroplane.

722
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:02,389
I had to let it go.
You got to let it go!

723
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,266
When it's time to let it go...

724
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,392
you gotta let it go.

725
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,435
- Let it go and let God.
- Go ahead.

726
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,478
That's nature. Yep, nature.

727
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,480
I'm fixin' to let go. Let it go.

728
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:13,650
Good job.

729
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:16,111
That was beautiful.

730
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:18,280
Music to my ears.

731
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:22,493
I hear you're gonna
take her out somewhere.

732
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:29,791
You gonna get some?

733
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,423
Nah, we're just...

734
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,133
We're just going to dinner.

735
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,468
Dinner? That's all that means.

736
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,595
When you ask a woman to dinner...

737
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,305
that means you're fixin' to get some.

738
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:45,516
Nasty bastard! Always in my house!

739
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,059
Passing gas!

740
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:53,315
Oh. How you doing? I'm Mabel. Hello.

741
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,150
Yeah.

742
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,110
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

743
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:59,488
Have a seat. She'll be down in a minute.

744
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,323
- Want something to drink?
- I'm OK. Thank you.

745
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:02,991
Sit down. Sit down. Rest yourself.

746
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,334
You know she's got two kids, don't ya?

747
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:15,462
Yes, I do. I know.

748
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:18,924
And you still want to go out with her?

749
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,801
I got a son, too.

750
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:22,344
You must be desperate.

751
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:24,513
Joe, shut up.

752
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,475
Be careful now, she's fertile.

753
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,479
Fertile. She gets pregnant easy.

754
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:35,315
Shut the hell up.

755
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:40,404
Hey! Hey!

756
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,156
Don't you look beautiful, honey?

757
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,782
Hi.

758
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:47,286
You ready?

759
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,246
Yeah.

760
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:52,040
You go on. I got these kids.

761
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:53,125
Thanks a lot.

762
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,168
All right, baby.

763
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:57,087
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Good night.

764
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,589
All right. See you later, Rocky.

765
00:38:58,672 --> 00:38:59,590
Frankie.

766
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:03,260
Whatever. Rocky, Rocko, whatever.

767
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,304
Do the rocka-wear.

768
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,225
You know she coming back
here pregnant, don't ya?

769
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,241
The sunlight danced across her body...

770
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:27,784
as lightning flashed.

771
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:30,746
I knew God had to be angry.

772
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:32,915
Of course she was mine and I was hers...

773
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,166
but only for that moment...

774
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,168
because just as the sun...

775
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,379
interrupted the moon...

776
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:42,716
I knew that evening would end.

777
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,426
And so would we...

778
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,720
because we both were...

779
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,430
a part of another family.

780
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:50,557
Thank you.

781
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:03,862
I knew you were gonna like it.

782
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:06,198
Tonight's poets and painters' night.

783
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:08,283
The poet speaks and the painter paints.

784
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:11,829
But the catch is you
only have two minutes.

785
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,871
It's fun.

786
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:15,123
What I want you to
do right now, crowd...

787
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,626
is put your hands together
for Frankie and Vanessa.

788
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:34,101
I'm a little nervous about this.

789
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:36,436
I didn't know that he signed us up.

790
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,813
We're all family here.

791
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,649
You all show 'em some love, please.

792
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,946
This is called...

793
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:50,492
"The courage to love."

794
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,795
It takes courage...

795
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,505
to love again...

796
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:05,007
when you've been hurt.

797
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,640
It takes pain...

798
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:16,393
and strength again...

799
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:24,651
To pack it all away.

800
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:30,365
Somewhere in all the pain...

801
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:34,077
somebody has to have the courage...

802
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,584
to be OK.

803
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:48,550
Pain...

804
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:49,635
gives...

805
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,386
me...

806
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:52,554
courage...

807
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,058
to love.

808
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,606
Thank you.

809
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,906
I don't know why I keep doing this.

810
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:35,407
I mean, things are good.

811
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:38,911
When they're good, they're good, right?

812
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:47,002
I'm sorry, Lisa.

813
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:53,091
I love you so much, and
l... and I... I can't...

814
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:04,353
I'm gonna go to counseling.

815
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:10,275
Just don't leave me.

816
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:13,195
OK? I'm gonna get help, just...

817
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:19,868
Everybody I love leaves me.

818
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,540
I can't do this anymore.

819
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:28,418
I just said I was sorry.

820
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:31,713
That's not enough.

821
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:37,344
Wha...

822
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,723
You want to leave me?

823
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:44,935
Do you want to leave me?!

824
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,112
OK.

825
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:03,328
That's the only way
you're gonna leave me.

826
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,126
Stop!

827
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,087
- No! Stop!
- You want to go?

828
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:13,213
Stop it! Please!

829
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:14,423
OK! OK!

830
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,049
I'll stay!

831
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:17,259
What?!

832
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:18,886
I'll stay! What?

833
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,388
Say it louder. Say it louder.

834
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:25,225
I'll stay! I'll stay!

835
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,613
I'll stay.

836
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:44,077
Tell me that you love me.

837
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:48,582
I love you.

838
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:52,211
Tell me that you love me again.

839
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:53,212
I love you.

840
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:54,213
Say it again.

841
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:58,091
I love you. I love you.

842
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,146
OK. OK.

843
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:13,899
It's gonna be OK.

844
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:30,833
I have never, in all my
life, had such a good time.

845
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:34,670
You should have called
me a long time ago.

846
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:37,840
When my son was born...

847
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,551
I turned my life over to God...

848
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,720
and I've been celibate since then...

849
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:47,766
and I will be until I get married.

850
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,477
It's just easier not to date.

851
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,193
Is that what you think
I wanted from you, sex?

852
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:03,907
Let's be honest. All
men come for something.

853
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,037
Some men come to restore.

854
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:18,338
I had a really good time tonight.

855
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:24,428
Thank you.

856
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,165
So...

857
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:20,002
Donna tells me that you
have been out every night...

858
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:22,671
with a certain bus driver.

859
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:25,507
He's a great guy.

860
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,217
He loves kids.

861
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:30,512
Just when I thought...

862
00:49:30,596 --> 00:49:33,891
that every man was gonna be the same...

863
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,350
here he comes.

864
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:38,020
I think you're in love.

865
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:41,690
I'm... in strong like.

866
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,987
Besides, you're the one getting married.

867
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,198
You're the one in love.

868
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:55,078
I don't love him...

869
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,039
the way he loves me.

870
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:59,708
Then why are you marrying him?

871
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,335
Mom says love will come.

872
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:04,046
Mom.

873
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:05,047
Don't do that.

874
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,256
You listen to me.

875
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,716
Don't blame her.

876
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:09,092
She has had you under her thumb...

877
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,385
since you were born.

878
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:11,887
She lives her life through you.

879
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,766
Don't you wanna just make
a decision on your own?

880
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:17,309
Just once?

881
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:18,852
Lisa, you gotta learn to fight.

882
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:20,938
Fight?

883
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:24,358
I've never had to fight before.

884
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,902
Somebody has always fought for me.

885
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:31,740
And I can't... I can't fight him.

886
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:34,243
He just gets so angry.

887
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:37,830
Is he hitting you?

888
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:45,504
Yeah.

889
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:50,300
Hell, no! Madea!

890
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:53,136
You are staying here tonight!

891
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,471
Do you understand me?

892
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:55,764
Promise me you will not say anything.

893
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:56,932
What's going on?

894
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,106
We have a friend...

895
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,275
and her husband is beating her...

896
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:08,110
and we would just like to know...

897
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:09,403
what we should do.

898
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:12,406
Before or after his funeral?

899
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:18,453
Does she want to get out?

900
00:51:18,537 --> 00:51:20,497
Does she?

901
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,334
Yes.

902
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,295
But he won't let her.

903
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:31,258
Sit down. Let me tell you a story.

904
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,387
Sit down.

905
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:39,099
I'm 'a tell you this.

906
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,518
Can't nobody help your friend
until she wanna get help.

907
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,687
You can want all your
life to help somebody...

908
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,272
but if they don't want to get help...

909
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:46,607
it ain't gonna happen.

910
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,108
You listen to me.

911
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:51,737
When you get tired of a
man hittin' on you, honey...

912
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:56,241
ain't nothing you can do
but cook breakfast for him.

913
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,118
Cook breakfast.

914
00:51:58,202 --> 00:51:59,328
Bring him into the kitchen...

915
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:02,331
and get you a big old
pot of hot grits...

916
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,458
and when it start to boil like lava...

917
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,168
and after he got good and comfortable...

918
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,753
you say, "good morning."

919
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:10,214
Throw it right on him.

920
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,673
Get you a pot like this...

921
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:14,968
Take it and throw it.

922
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:16,678
You need you a skillet...

923
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:19,264
with a nice good balanced weight on it.

924
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:20,265
You understand?

925
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:22,518
And as you throw it, you swat.

926
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,186
Throw it and swat, you hear me?

927
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:25,854
Throw it and swat.

928
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:27,481
Venus and Serena.

929
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:29,149
That's called grit ball.

930
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,574
So the third-quarter
profit should be up 17%.

931
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,159
Beautiful work, everyone.

932
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:41,411
I will see you all tomorrow.

933
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:44,915
Thank you.

934
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,461
Kevin, don't forget that
wire transfer, all right?

935
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:54,091
Mr. Armstrong...

936
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,510
a Victoria Breaux is here to see you.

937
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:57,886
Send her in.

938
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:04,476
Hello, Carlos.

939
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:06,895
I rushed right over.

940
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:09,648
She hasn't been home in 3 days.

941
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:11,275
My patience is wearing thin.

942
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,695
How can I convince her
what a great man you are...

943
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:16,947
if you insist on acting
like such a savage?

944
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,240
Savage?

945
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:20,993
I'm a collector of beautiful things.

946
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:22,870
Now, would I scratch my Monet?

947
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:24,955
Would I deface my Picasso?

948
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:27,207
I won't keep bringing
my child back to you...

949
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,418
if you continue to
put your hands on her.

950
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:32,045
Your child? You almost
sound like her mother.

951
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:35,090
Let's not get this thing twisted.

952
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:37,301
I've been your banker
for the last 4 years.

953
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,345
I know better than
anyone why you want this.

954
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:43,223
I am not the only one benefiting here.

955
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:47,728
If she found out...

956
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:51,148
that I have had access
to her trust fund...

957
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,108
through you, Mr. Investment banker...

958
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,195
you are on the line as well.

959
00:53:56,278 --> 00:53:58,697
Now here are the rules of engagement.

960
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,825
You will not hit her again.

961
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:04,119
And I will tell her that
you're getting counseling...

962
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:06,163
which may not be such a bad idea.

963
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:08,248
I read about women like you.

964
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:10,542
Women who live their lives
through their daughters...

965
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:13,504
entering them into
pageants and acting classes.

966
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:15,714
'Cause you really want
to be her, don't you?

967
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:18,759
I've read about men like you, too.

968
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:20,761
Overachievers.

969
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:24,139
Trying to make up for what they lack.

970
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:27,684
Controlling because they
really are insecure...

971
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:28,727
and they think...

972
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:30,854
that when they're in public...

973
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:33,649
everyone can see their little secret.

974
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:46,870
You want me, don't you?

975
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,001
Don't flatter yourself.

976
00:54:55,629 --> 00:54:57,506
You see, I like men.

977
00:54:57,548 --> 00:54:59,550
Real men...

978
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:02,553
and not little boys who
throw temper tantrums...

979
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,471
'cause they can't control little girls.

980
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,348
Your horns are showing.

981
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,643
Are you upset because mine are bigger?

982
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:11,228
And...

983
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:14,064
for the record...

984
00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:16,900
if I wanted you...

985
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,986
I could have you.

986
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:22,447
I think the saddest
thing I've ever seen...

987
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:25,659
Was Ali...

988
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:30,205
fighting past his prime.

989
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:34,501
Or Sinatra singing
after his voice was shot.

990
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:36,545
Now, what I love about Lena Horne...

991
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:39,173
see, Lena Horne was a lady...

992
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:44,553
and a lady always knows when to leave.

993
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:50,726
So, what are you?

994
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:52,853
I'm a lady who's got you by the balls.

995
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:56,273
I want your daughter
in my house... tonight!

996
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:15,542
I better go.

997
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:16,919
No, no, no.

998
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,089
Come here.

999
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:22,966
I'm gonna show you something.

1000
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:28,430
What is it?

1001
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:37,856
I call it "Vanessa's rain."

1002
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,859
The passion in your eyes.

1003
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:44,154
This red line represents...

1004
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:45,322
the pain...

1005
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:48,867
that you're trying to hide from me...

1006
00:56:48,951 --> 00:56:50,744
and this is your heart.

1007
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:53,038
That's where I wanna be.

1008
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,212
What?

1009
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:02,756
No one's ever done anything like this...

1010
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,509
for me before.

1011
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:08,470
It's so special.

1012
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:16,311
You're special.

1013
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:28,383
You already ate yours. This is mommy's.

1014
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:29,384
Hey!

1015
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:30,886
What are you doing with my kids?!

1016
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:32,513
He bought us ice cream.

1017
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:35,015
You OK?

1018
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:39,019
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1019
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:40,979
Come here. Come here.

1020
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,189
I'm 'a go play with cars.

1021
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:44,650
Come here. Let me see you.

1022
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:47,820
OK. OK.

1023
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:48,987
I want you to go pack your things...

1024
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:51,365
'cause we're gonna go, OK?

1025
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,577
Did I do something wrong?

1026
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,622
I don't know you well enough...

1027
00:58:58,705 --> 00:59:00,207
for you to be taking my kids...

1028
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,917
and I don't know where you're going!

1029
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,127
All right. I'll take you home.

1030
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:07,548
No, we're gonna be fine.

1031
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:10,551
Nima, come on, now!
Right now! Right now!

1032
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:12,094
Kids, look, mommy's gonna talk...

1033
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:14,346
to Uncle Frankie for
a second, all right?

1034
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:15,722
We'll be right back.

1035
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:22,771
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

1036
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:26,650
You were sleeping so peacefully,
and I know you're tired.

1037
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:27,985
Now, the kids were up...

1038
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,361
and I didn't want them to wake you...

1039
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:30,821
so I took 'em out for some ice cream.

1040
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:33,615
I just wanted you to rest.

1041
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:42,166
Nobody is gonna hurt my kids.

1042
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:43,375
I love you.

1043
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:51,842
Don't you know I would
never, ever hurt your kids...

1044
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:54,094
or you?

1045
01:00:02,478 --> 01:00:03,896
I think that...

1046
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,939
"You think that."

1047
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:07,316
Don't tell me what you think.

1048
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:08,525
Hey, tell me...

1049
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,986
Tell me what you feel.

1050
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:15,657
I feel that...

1051
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,827
that you won't hurt them.

1052
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:21,997
Or you.

1053
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:25,792
Or me.

1054
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,346
Oh, God.

1055
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,865
You almost knocked me down here.

1056
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,744
You know I don't allow
no running in this house.

1057
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:01,787
Look.

1058
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:04,665
Ah, you got a "B."

1059
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:06,375
Go ahead, honey, you smart.

1060
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:07,376
I am.

1061
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:08,377
Yes, that's wonderful.

1062
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,921
I never would have been able
to figure out that algeroe...

1063
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:12,381
and you done figured it out.

1064
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:14,007
That is good.

1065
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:16,844
You did prove you can be
anything you want to be.

1066
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:18,011
Go ahead on.

1067
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:21,181
I look at all the kids at school...

1068
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:22,808
and they have parents to help them.

1069
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:25,686
Well, that make you smarter than them...

1070
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,980
'cause you figured it
out all by yourself.

1071
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:29,231
Where your folks at anyway?

1072
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:31,066
When is they coming to get you?

1073
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:32,568
That's what I want to know.

1074
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:35,571
I never knew my daddy,
and my mama's in jail.

1075
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:37,698
I got a bunch of kids I never knew.

1076
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,449
I might be your daddy.

1077
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:42,536
Joe, this baby can stay
here long as she want to.

1078
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:44,872
The hell she can.

1079
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:45,914
Can I?

1080
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:47,749
Yes, till you go off to college.

1081
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:48,750
College?

1082
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,419
Smart as you is, you better go.

1083
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:52,713
It ain't where you come from, honey...

1084
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:53,714
it's where you going.

1085
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,799
No matter what your mama
was or who your daddy was...

1086
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:57,009
you can be anything you want to be.

1087
01:01:57,092 --> 01:01:58,510
Look at Brian.

1088
01:01:58,594 --> 01:01:59,845
He turned out to be a lawyer.

1089
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:01,096
Look at his daddy...

1090
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:03,599
a big old lump of nothing.

1091
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:07,019
Better a lump of nothing
than a lump of cow manu-der.

1092
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:11,940
What you want to be when you grow up?

1093
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:14,067
A lawyer.

1094
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:15,235
Oh, a lawyer. That's good...

1095
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:16,612
'cause I might need you to get me off...

1096
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:18,071
after I kill him... Murder One.

1097
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:21,742
I'm gonna be a lawyer.

1098
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:22,743
I'm gonna go call Tiffany.

1099
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:24,203
OK, go call Tiffany.

1100
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:25,871
Gonna be a lawyer. Go ahead, baby.

1101
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:29,750
You know how much college cost
for that child to be a lawyer?

1102
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:30,959
Who gonna pay for it?

1103
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:34,087
Well, I figure if you
do us a favor and die...

1104
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:36,465
we can use your insurance money.

1105
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:39,510
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

1106
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:42,095
You could sell milk... "got milk?"

1107
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:43,096
Go straight to hell, Joe.

1108
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,097
I'm already talking about somebody.

1109
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:45,265
Just shut up.

1110
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,852
Knock-knock.

1111
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:51,230
Oh, Uncle Joe.

1112
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:52,356
Hi, Madea.

1113
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:54,691
Where is Lisa?

1114
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:55,776
She upstairs somewhere.

1115
01:02:55,818 --> 01:02:58,070
Go on, turn around so I
can watch you walk out.

1116
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:02,991

Knock-knock-knock.

1117
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,995
Honey, I came to get you.

1118
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:08,622
I brought you a little something.

1119
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:20,008
She doesn't want to marry this man.

1120
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,345
I'm not gonna argue with you about this.

1121
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:24,471
Then don't.

1122
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:25,973
Is this how you want to live?

1123
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:27,266
Pathetic like your sister?

1124
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,810
Look how she lives.

1125
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:31,353
Is this what you want?

1126
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:33,689
Why are you trying to make
her think this is about her?

1127
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:37,484
You've been living off her
trust fund all these years...

1128
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:40,279
and now that it's almost
gone, you need a new source.

1129
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:41,488
My dad left her money.

1130
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:42,865
He didn't leave her a dime.

1131
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:46,493
He left it all for his
first wife. She's broke.

1132
01:03:46,577 --> 01:03:47,786
Stop lying to your sister.

1133
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,204
What?

1134
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,501
Lisa, you remember all those trips...

1135
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:57,296
that you took to the museum
with Mother on the weekends...

1136
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:58,881
when I was left at home...

1137
01:03:58,964 --> 01:04:01,592
and she would tell you
I was being punished?

1138
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:03,886
I came here to try to
smooth things out with you...

1139
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:06,513
but if you want to continue
telling these lies, I'm leaving.

1140
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:10,184
No, you're not.

1141
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:12,227
You're gonna sit right
there. You're gonna listen.

1142
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:16,815
Lisa, one day, I was sitting
at the bottom of the stairs...

1143
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:19,443
and I heard Mom and your
dad arguing about me.

1144
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:25,824
You're too young to remember,
but he was gonna leave.

1145
01:04:25,908 --> 01:04:27,159
Oh, my God.

1146
01:04:27,242 --> 01:04:28,911
And I heard Mom say, "No."

1147
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,497
"Don't. Please.

1148
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,041
"I'll do it. I'll do it."

1149
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:36,084
And I didn't know what
she was talking about.

1150
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:40,881
When she came in, she found me.

1151
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,886
Then she put me in the bathtub...

1152
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:54,061
and she combed my hair...

1153
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:01,318
and she put make-up on me...

1154
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:09,201
and perfume.

1155
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:14,414
And she said...

1156
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,002
"Just relax."

1157
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:29,263
And then she let him
come in and rape me.

1158
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,640
That is not true.

1159
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:34,810
Yes, it is true, and
you're gonna tell her.

1160
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:36,311
You are gonna tell her!

1161
01:05:36,395 --> 01:05:37,646
He asked me for you.

1162
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:40,190
I had done everything
I could in our family...

1163
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:41,942
everything I could to please him.

1164
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:44,695
If we were gonna be comfortable...

1165
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:48,198
I had to make some hard, hard decisions.

1166
01:05:49,825 --> 01:05:52,494
He would have walked out
and left us destitute.

1167
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:53,704
You should be happy...

1168
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:55,664
you were able to save our family.

1169
01:05:55,747 --> 01:05:58,083
Are you insane?

1170
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:00,002
No. I'm a realist.

1171
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:03,505
I worked...

1172
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:05,382
worked two jobs.

1173
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:08,177
When your low-down
father walked out on me...

1174
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:13,056
and I was tired, and I deserved better.

1175
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,058
And when I snatched my
little bit of happiness...

1176
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:17,144
I was not gonna let you
take that away from me.

1177
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:21,857
Sweetheart...

1178
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:25,986
you were my only option.

1179
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:29,198
Mom...

1180
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:30,324
"Mom."

1181
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,993
Just stop that whining. Just stop it.

1182
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:36,288
I have taken care of you
like a little princess...

1183
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,665
the best schools, go
in designer clothes...

1184
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:39,833
all of that.

1185
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,461
Now it is time for
you to take care of me!

1186
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:44,546
You hear me?

1187
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:48,717
My mother was a real whore...

1188
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:49,843
and a junkie...

1189
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:52,262
and she traded me...

1190
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:55,766
for ten dollars and a fix.

1191
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:05,609
There are many things in
my life that I regret...

1192
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:09,530
including having you for a daughter...

1193
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,949
because that man was your father.

1194
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:18,330
But I will not...

1195
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,793
apologize for the decisions I made.

1196
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:27,548
I am not your tragedy.

1197
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:31,051
Lisa, I thought that she
was just controlling you...

1198
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:33,053
but she's been controlling me, too.

1199
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:39,685
I worry about my children...

1200
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:42,604
about what somebody's
gonna do to them...

1201
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:44,773
every second they're out of my sight.

1202
01:07:46,817 --> 01:07:49,361
I have a man...

1203
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,367
who wants to love me...

1204
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,786
but I won't let him because of you.

1205
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:02,291
I refuse to let you
hold me back anymore.

1206
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:06,753
I'm gonna love hard.

1207
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:10,299
I'm gonna be a better mother.

1208
01:08:13,177 --> 01:08:16,180
You don't win...

1209
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:21,727
because your
hand-me-downs stop here.

1210
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:28,734
I forgive you...

1211
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:32,321
with all my might...

1212
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,119
and I'm gonna pray...

1213
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:42,206
that God has mercy on your soul.

1214
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:00,349
Get your things.

1215
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:02,142
I'll wait for you in the car.

1216
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:16,782
I'm so sorry.

1217
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:23,497
No, I'm sorry.

1218
01:10:10,919 --> 01:10:12,504
I told you to get off the phone.

1219
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:14,298
If you roll your eyes at me again...

1220
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:15,757
I'll take 'em out and turn 'em around...

1221
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:16,800
and have 'em looking at you.

1222
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:20,429
Lord have mercy.

1223
01:10:21,263 --> 01:10:23,682
It's so good to see the
whole family together.

1224
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:25,017
Thank you, Madea.

1225
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,436
I try. I use my pistol
for some of 'em...

1226
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:28,770
'cause that's all they understood.

1227
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:31,815
I had to threaten half of 'em here.

1228
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:33,066
Aunt Ruby ninety-six.

1229
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:35,360
She needed to see all her family.

1230
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:36,528
I'm thirsty.

1231
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:38,071
Baby, get us some lemonade
out the house, please.

1232
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:39,114
Yes, ma'am.

1233
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:43,452
They told me she was a handful.

1234
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:45,913
How you get her to be so polite?

1235
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:47,539
I been tearing that ass up.

1236
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:51,627
I look at all these foster parents...

1237
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,629
taking these children in,
just trying to get money...

1238
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:54,755
but you know what I found out?

1239
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:56,548
Ain't nothing wrong with these children.

1240
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:59,092
All they need is some
love and support...

1241
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:00,761
and somebody be patient with them...

1242
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:01,929
and they'll be all right.

1243
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,264
That's what I found
out about these kids.

1244
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:06,433
Didn't I tell you to get
the hell off that telephone?

1245
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:07,601
What is your problem?

1246
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:09,770
I told you to hang up Aunt Ruby's phone.

1247
01:11:09,812 --> 01:11:12,231
I'll shove it so far down your throat...

1248
01:11:12,314 --> 01:11:14,983
all you gonna be able to do
is dial 911 with your navel.

1249
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,235
Do you hear me?

1250
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:18,028
Get the hell in the house
and hang up the phone!

1251
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:19,613
Put it on the hook.

1252
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:29,122
Gotta be patient with
these babies, you know?

1253
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,293
Is that Victoria?

1254
01:11:36,088 --> 01:11:38,131
Lord have mercy.

1255
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:41,176
Who wears heels to a family reunion?

1256
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:43,512
Hello.

1257
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:46,223
Hello, ladies.

1258
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:48,142
It's warm out today, isn't it?

1259
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:51,520
Be cooler if you had
on some regular clothes.

1260
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:54,857
That's a nice dress, Victoria.

1261
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,191
Thank you.

1262
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:58,318
It's kind of haute, isn't it?

1263
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,489
It's all the rave in Paris.

1264
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:05,159
Well, this is hot Georgier.

1265
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:06,869
It is not Paree...

1266
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:09,705
so we don't wear dressie like that.

1267
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:10,789
You look silly.

1268
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,044
Trying to be so bougie,
oui-oui, pee-pee.

1269
01:12:17,296 --> 01:12:18,547
Where is everyone?

1270
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:24,011
She's going to need some deodorie.

1271
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,516
For her bootie!

1272
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,398
Girl, I already told them,
"I'm not going down..."

1273
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,484
Good Lord. Who they kin to?

1274
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:40,527
Who them is?

1275
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:43,238
That's Henry Lee's daughter.

1276
01:12:43,322 --> 01:12:44,990
That's Henry Lee little girl?

1277
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,993
She got her daddy face,
but her mama everything...

1278
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:49,495
Hey, hey, wait. Come here, baby.

1279
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:51,830
Come to Uncle Joe.

1280
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:53,248
How you doing, baby?

1281
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:55,375
Listen, I'm a little thirsty.

1282
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:57,836
Reach down in that
barrel, and get me a drink.

1283
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:01,715
But lookit, I need it
cold, 'cause I'm parched...

1284
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:03,550
so reach down deep in the bottom.

1285
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:08,889
Good Lord almighty.

1286
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:16,063
Deep, baby, deeper...

1287
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:22,778
Thank you so much.

1288
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:28,033
Grover, you want a drink?

1289
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:29,076
No.

1290
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,538
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

1291
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,748
Me, too, honey.

1292
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,375
Way down in there.

1293
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:45,259
They ain't got no more.

1294
01:13:48,971 --> 01:13:50,597
Lord have mercy.

1295
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:52,766
If I wasn't on that heart medication...

1296
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:54,726
and didn't have this
blood pressure problem...

1297
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:56,478
and waiting on the kidney transplant...

1298
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,230
and was on dialysis...

1299
01:13:58,313 --> 01:13:59,982
I might take that Viagra.

1300
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:02,401
I might go and take a chance with it.

1301
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:07,114
I got him, I got him.

1302
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:08,157
Back door. Beat him up.

1303
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:09,700
Ball up!

1304
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:11,160
Get over there.

1305
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:12,619
Watch the switch.

1306
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:21,628
Good game, man.

1307
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:23,964
Nice time. Very good.

1308
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,926
I got next up.

1309
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:30,304
You got to let me rest, man. I'm tired.

1310
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:31,805
Don't tell me you're getting old.

1311
01:14:31,847 --> 01:14:33,265
I ain't gonna tell you, then.

1312
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:34,558
I'm gonna get some food.

1313
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,148
How's Deborah doing?

1314
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,567
She's good. She's in the house.

1315
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:44,610
Is she?

1316
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,070
I'm gonna say hi to her.

1317
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:48,280
You don't want to go in there now.

1318
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:49,323
The women in there.

1319
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:52,117
You do not want to go in the kitchen.

1320
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:57,206
Oh, my goodness.

1321
01:14:57,289 --> 01:15:00,459
Baby, we were just talking about you.

1322
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:02,294
It's good to see you, baby.

1323
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:03,712
How are you?

1324
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:06,882
I'm good. I haven't seen
this side of my family...

1325
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:08,509
in a long time, though.

1326
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:10,886
I feel so much love here.

1327
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:13,514
Whenever you come around family...

1328
01:15:13,597 --> 01:15:15,015
you can find love.

1329
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:16,558
You can sense it.

1330
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:21,104
And a bride-to-be will
wear it as a garment.

1331
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:23,315
Oh, yes, darling.

1332
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:25,234
And what about your garment?

1333
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:26,652
Where is it?

1334
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:30,364
I'm sorry. I don't understand...

1335
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,077
I guess my question really is...

1336
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,997
when are we going to get
to meet this mystery man?

1337
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:40,207
Indeed.

1338
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,042
He'll be here soon.

1339
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:44,419
And I'm sure you're
all going to love him.

1340
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:52,970
You all should be so happy for her.

1341
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:54,263
Yes, of course.

1342
01:15:54,346 --> 01:15:56,890
Of course, and we want
to be happy for her...

1343
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:00,477
except that the jury
is still out on that.

1344
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,689
I mean, tell me, baby...

1345
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:07,568
are you really ready to marry this man?

1346
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:10,571
I've thought about it.

1347
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:12,197
Of course she is.

1348
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:15,075
She loves him.

1349
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:19,163
She loves him.

1350
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:23,959
That's a very important factor...

1351
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:26,670
and I can tell you about love.

1352
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,006
William...

1353
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:31,967
that's my husband's name...

1354
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:35,929
we had a love so strong...

1355
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:39,308
that it just seemed like we were one.

1356
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,353
I would get ready to
tell him something...

1357
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:46,940
and he would open his mouth
and say the very thing...

1358
01:16:47,024 --> 01:16:48,692
that I was fixing to tell him.

1359
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:51,487
You know how frustrating
that was sometimes?

1360
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:53,530
Oh, Lord, I couldn't stand it.

1361
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:55,782
And then...

1362
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:00,287
there were those moments
when I would just...

1363
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:03,832
lay my head on his chest...

1364
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,461
just to listen to his heart beat.

1365
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:10,506
And then one night...

1366
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:15,636
I realized that his
heartbeat matched mine.

1367
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:18,889
Lord have mercy.

1368
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:22,434
Rhythm's off, now he's gone.

1369
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:25,187
I'm so sorry, Aunt Myrtle.

1370
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:26,939
Oh, don't fret for me, sweetheart.

1371
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:30,776
I have had an opportunity...

1372
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:33,195
that few people ever get on this earth.

1373
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:39,910
God has blessed me to share
time and space with a man...

1374
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:44,081
that he designed himself just for me.

1375
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,710
I've not only been blessed...

1376
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:52,339
I have been divinely favored.

1377
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:53,715
It's so true.

1378
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:59,513
You know, Myrtle, I weep
for these young women today.

1379
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:04,768
Some of them will never know that.

1380
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:08,730
In fact, never know even a portion...

1381
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,566
of what you're talking about.

1382
01:18:12,568 --> 01:18:16,572
Darlings, love is many things.

1383
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:18,115
It's varied.

1384
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,828
One thing it is not and can never be...

1385
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:24,079
is unsure.

1386
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,170
Take me outside.

1387
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:33,255
I want to be with my family.

1388
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:34,464
Oh, Ruby.

1389
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,490
Almost hit it.

1390
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:00,699
You must be Carlos.

1391
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:01,909
Is it that obvious?

1392
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,202
Yeah, a little bit.

1393
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:05,120
I'm Brian, Lisa's cousin. How you doing?

1394
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:07,206
Come on, I'll introduce
you to everybody.

1395
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:51,959
So pleased you were able to join us.

1396
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:54,002
I want you to meet Mabel.

1397
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:55,629
And Calvin.

1398
01:19:55,671 --> 01:19:56,797
How you doing?

1399
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:59,007
This is Carlos, Lisa's fiance.

1400
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:04,638
I'm Frankie.

1401
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,014
I know who you are.

1402
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:08,851
Mom, I was hoping that we
could talk for a minute.

1403
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:10,310
I can't talk to you now.

1404
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,146
I'm talking to your sister
about something more important.

1405
01:20:15,274 --> 01:20:18,277
I want you to take Carlos
around and introduce him...

1406
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,695
make him feel more comfortable.

1407
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:20,696
We're talking.

1408
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:22,322
And be happy about it.

1409
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:24,116
How can she be happy about it?

1410
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:26,201
What would you know about being happy...

1411
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:27,953
coming in here with some bus driver?

1412
01:20:28,036 --> 01:20:29,705
Can you not do this right now?

1413
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:31,373
I'm tired of her in your ear...

1414
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:33,625
about to ruin the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1415
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:35,752
Don't you mean the best thing
that ever happened to you?

1416
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:36,795
You can't listen to her...

1417
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:39,339
'cause she has nothing,
never will have anything...

1418
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:41,216
and she's jealous of you
because you're so beautiful...

1419
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:42,759
Jealous?

1420
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:44,386
You've always been jealous of
our relationship, because...

1421
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:46,513
You know I've always loved her more.

1422
01:20:46,597 --> 01:20:50,309
You just hate the idea
that anybody might love me.

1423
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:52,644
If that man loves you, he's a damn fool!

1424
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:54,354
You are such a bitch.

1425
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:02,613
Stop that fighting, I say!

1426
01:21:02,696 --> 01:21:05,115
"Girls Gone Wild, Senior Edition."

1427
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:09,411
Stop that fighting!

1428
01:21:09,453 --> 01:21:11,330
I don't know where you came from!

1429
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:13,749
You are so damn evil!

1430
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,918
I am my mother's daughter!

1431
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:29,890
Pray on

1432
01:21:29,973 --> 01:21:34,895
Just a little while longer

1433
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:38,982
Pray on

1434
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:42,653
Just a little while

1435
01:21:42,736 --> 01:21:45,239
Longer

1436
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:48,992
Pray on

1437
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:54,540
Just a little while longer

1438
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:59,253
And everything, yes

1439
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:03,507
Is gonna be all right

1440
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:36,999
Is this what we paid for?

1441
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:40,878
What is she talking about?

1442
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:43,172
I'll tell you what she's talking about.

1443
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:48,510
This is the first family reunion...

1444
01:22:48,594 --> 01:22:52,139
we have had in five years.

1445
01:22:54,183 --> 01:22:56,059
Aunt Ruby...

1446
01:22:56,143 --> 01:22:59,396
she's ninety-six years old.

1447
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:03,442
Ninety-six.

1448
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:08,030
Family reunions...

1449
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:12,493
are about uniting the family...

1450
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:16,413
bringing together the young and the old.

1451
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:20,334
Singing and dancing...

1452
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,961
and thanking God, giving him the glory.

1453
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:26,590
Thanking him for getting us over.

1454
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:32,179
As we marched up the road...

1455
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:33,847
this afternoon...

1456
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:38,852
what we saw were young men gambling...

1457
01:23:38,936 --> 01:23:40,854
fighting, cussing...

1458
01:23:43,065 --> 01:23:45,609
women with no clothes on...

1459
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:48,403
gyrating all over on this land.

1460
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:53,075
Do you see this shack?

1461
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,955
The man and woman who were born here...

1462
01:23:58,038 --> 01:24:01,041
gave birth to this generation.

1463
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:03,585
They were slaves.

1464
01:24:03,627 --> 01:24:05,712
They worked this ground...

1465
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,173
but they bought it...

1466
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:12,469
from the widow of the slave owner...

1467
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:14,972
and that's the kind of blood we have...

1468
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:16,515
running through our veins.

1469
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:19,726
That's the stock that we are made of.

1470
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,019
What happened to us?

1471
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:24,898
Who are you?

1472
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,817
Do you know who you are?

1473
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,903
What happened to the
pride and the dignity...

1474
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:33,782
and the love and respect
that we had for one another?

1475
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,036
Where did it go?

1476
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:40,831
And how...

1477
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:43,667
How do we get it back?

1478
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:47,546
I'm 'a tell you.

1479
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:51,633
Young black men, take your place.

1480
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:54,219
We need you!

1481
01:24:54,303 --> 01:24:58,432
Your sons and daughters need you.

1482
01:24:58,474 --> 01:25:00,392
Did you understand what I just said?

1483
01:25:00,476 --> 01:25:03,395
You were sold off and
had no choice, yes...

1484
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:05,606
but now it's time to stay.

1485
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:07,524
Take your place!

1486
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:11,153
Now! Starting now!

1487
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:16,158
Young black women...

1488
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:21,330
you are more than your
thighs and your hips.

1489
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:24,500
You are beautiful, strong, powerful.

1490
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,293
I want more from you!

1491
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:28,545
Take your place.

1492
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:32,132
I want every single one of you...

1493
01:25:32,216 --> 01:25:35,010
young man, young woman...

1494
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:37,888
turn to the next person...

1495
01:25:37,971 --> 01:25:40,682
standing alongside of you.

1496
01:25:40,766 --> 01:25:42,100
Grab them and hug them...

1497
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,019
and tell them that you love 'em.

1498
01:25:45,395 --> 01:25:47,981
Tell them, "If you need
anything, come to me."

1499
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:50,609
"If you need somebody
to talk to, come to me."

1500
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:51,944
I love you, girl.

1501
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:52,986
Thank you, girl.

1502
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:54,488
"I'll give you the shoulder.

1503
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:56,406
"I'll give you the hug.

1504
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:58,492
"I'll feed you, I'll clothe you

1505
01:25:58,534 --> 01:26:00,327
"if you need it."

1506
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:02,204
That's how you start...

1507
01:26:02,246 --> 01:26:03,497
from this moment.

1508
01:26:04,706 --> 01:26:07,709
When you leave this reunion today...

1509
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,295
you take that with you.

1510
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:12,256
God bless y'all.

1511
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:13,465
God bless you.

1512
01:26:13,549 --> 01:26:14,508
God bless you, Grandma.

1513
01:27:58,237 --> 01:27:59,655
Vanessa just went to
church looking for you.

1514
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:00,948
What you doing here?

1515
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:03,283
You two look lovely.

1516
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:06,328
Looking like a big ol' pig
wrapped in a purple blanket...

1517
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:07,329
what you look like.

1518
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:09,248
Shut up and put your shoes on.

1519
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:11,542
Help that thing find his shoes
so we can get out of here.

1520
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:16,171
You all right?

1521
01:28:23,762 --> 01:28:24,888
Who is it?

1522
01:28:28,517 --> 01:28:30,310
You running from him?

1523
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:35,023
It's time to stop
running, honey, and fight.

1524
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:40,821
Come in.

1525
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:55,335
Madea, you look lovely.

1526
01:28:57,087 --> 01:28:58,547
You ready for my wedding?

1527
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,048
I only go to church for two reasons...

1528
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:01,633
weddings and funerals.

1529
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:03,552
Wonder what I'm dressed for today.

1530
01:29:06,638 --> 01:29:08,182
Don't you know it's bad luck...

1531
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:10,225
for the groom to see the
bride before the wedding?

1532
01:29:11,393 --> 01:29:13,562
In your case, it might be real bad luck.

1533
01:29:14,563 --> 01:29:16,356
You know I couldn't
resist the love of my life.

1534
01:29:16,398 --> 01:29:18,108
You know she tried to sneak
away from me last night?

1535
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:19,193
She did, Madea.

1536
01:29:20,152 --> 01:29:22,571
Can we just have a moment alone?

1537
01:29:23,363 --> 01:29:25,741
In my house? Hell, no.

1538
01:29:25,824 --> 01:29:27,367
It's OK, Madea.

1539
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:29,578
It's OK, just go.

1540
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:37,294
Carlos, you look like you're hungry.

1541
01:29:40,589 --> 01:29:42,591
I got some hot grits
over there on the stove.

1542
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:46,512
Lisa, why don't you give Carlos some?

1543
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,389
They hot.

1544
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:56,939
Yeah, Carlos, you casket sharp.

1545
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:00,567
Come on, y'all, let's go.

1546
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:14,706
You must be out your mind.

1547
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:16,291
You got me all over this
city, walking around.

1548
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:18,418
Y'all didn't even see where...

1549
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:28,929
Is everything all right?

1550
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:31,098
It's fine. I'd know
that scream anywhere.

1551
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,058
Come on, let's go to the church.

1552
01:30:33,142 --> 01:30:35,769
Praise the Lord. God is good.

1553
01:30:35,853 --> 01:30:37,187
She in there playing grit ball.

1554
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:25,486
This place is nice.

1555
01:31:26,904 --> 01:31:28,363
Hey, all these bougie people.

1556
01:31:28,447 --> 01:31:30,157
- Hello.
- Hi.

1557
01:31:32,201 --> 01:31:35,037
I don't like no stuck-up
people like this.

1558
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:36,371
When are we going to be able to go in?

1559
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:37,915
That's what I want to know.

1560
01:31:37,998 --> 01:31:40,459
Where is she? She's late?

1561
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:42,002
Oh, my God. Excuse me.

1562
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:43,921
Excuse me. Calm down, everybody!

1563
01:31:44,004 --> 01:31:45,380
We're about to begin.

1564
01:31:45,422 --> 01:31:47,007
We're about to begin.

1565
01:31:47,049 --> 01:31:49,134
Hey, sweet thing. Don't I know you?

1566
01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:52,054
Excuse me? As if you could.

1567
01:31:52,095 --> 01:31:54,014
Now move, old man. Step aside.

1568
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:56,433
Did that thang just push you, Joe?

1569
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:57,518
Yeah, she did. She don't know us.

1570
01:31:57,559 --> 01:31:59,353
We're Baptists. We'll
tear this church up.

1571
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:02,397
You don't know me. I
will set it off in here.

1572
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:04,441
I will do a drive-by in this church.

1573
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:05,859
You better be glad you're at church.

1574
01:32:05,901 --> 01:32:08,570
Jesus just saved your
life. Hallelu-yer.

1575
01:32:08,654 --> 01:32:09,822
OK, listen now.

1576
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:12,241
You old people getting on my nerves now.

1577
01:32:12,324 --> 01:32:15,994
I'm trying to make this event
as professional as possible.

1578
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:19,206
That's why I can hardly
work with black people now...

1579
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:22,584
always late and ignorant.

1580
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:24,378
Y'all better tell
someone. She don't know me.

1581
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:26,922
She don't know me. She
don't know I'm a thug.

1582
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:29,216
I'm a real thug. I shot Tupac.

1583
01:32:29,258 --> 01:32:30,759
I did, the first time.

1584
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:32,094
We was arguing over a parking spot.

1585
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:33,846
I didn't kill him
though. That wasn't me.

1586
01:32:35,139 --> 01:32:37,766
Just a minute. Where are your dresses?

1587
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:39,893
What is the problem?

1588
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:46,859
Not quite what you expected.

1589
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:51,989
I'm not getting married today.

1590
01:32:59,663 --> 01:33:04,877
I've been beaten every
day since we got engaged.

1591
01:33:12,217 --> 01:33:15,596
And I've tried to
make excuses for him...

1592
01:33:15,637 --> 01:33:17,639
over and over and over again.

1593
01:33:20,434 --> 01:33:25,981
But it's time for me to start
making my own decisions...

1594
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:30,319
and live for Lisa.

1595
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:37,659
That's right.

1596
01:33:40,954 --> 01:33:43,916
I feel sorry for you.
One day you'll see.

1597
01:33:43,999 --> 01:33:47,127
Ah, Victoria, shut up!
We feel sorry for you.

1598
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:50,005
That child got her own life to live.

1599
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:52,508
You need to go get one and
stop trying to live hers.

1600
01:33:52,549 --> 01:33:58,138
I just hate that all my
hard work has gone to waste.

1601
01:33:58,222 --> 01:33:59,306
It doesn't have to.

1602
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:10,567
What are you doing?

1603
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:16,782
Do you love me?

1604
01:34:23,038 --> 01:34:24,039
I love you.

1605
01:34:25,249 --> 01:34:26,291
Prove it.

1606
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:28,877
Marry me.

1607
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:33,298
You want me to marry you?

1608
01:34:34,049 --> 01:34:36,260
Right now. Right here.

1609
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:47,396
All right, all right.

1610
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:49,815
Get them to the holding area.

1611
01:34:49,898 --> 01:34:51,567
Get a tux on him.

1612
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:53,193
Go, move, people!

1613
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:56,113
Come back over here, people.

1614
01:34:56,196 --> 01:34:58,782
There will be a wedding here today.

1615
01:34:58,866 --> 01:35:00,742
All is not lost.

1616
01:35:00,826 --> 01:35:02,202
Ladies and gentlemen...

1617
01:35:03,078 --> 01:35:04,663
I give you...

1618
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:08,750
Paris in springtime.

1619
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:23,891
Come right in.

1620
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:28,896
This is so gorgeous.

1621
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:45,579
The sun has come. The mists have gone.

1622
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:48,749
We see in the distance
our long way home.

1623
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:53,253
I was always yours to have.

1624
01:35:53,295 --> 01:35:54,922
You were always mine.

1625
01:35:55,923 --> 01:35:57,716
We have loved each other...

1626
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,510
in and out of time.

1627
01:36:00,928 --> 01:36:03,222
When the first stone...

1628
01:36:03,305 --> 01:36:06,016
Iooked up at the blazing sun...

1629
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:08,727
and the first tree struggled up...

1630
01:36:08,811 --> 01:36:10,437
from the forest floor...

1631
01:36:11,438 --> 01:36:14,858
I had always loved you more.

1632
01:36:14,942 --> 01:36:21,114
You freed your braids, gave
your hair to the breeze.

1633
01:36:21,156 --> 01:36:24,076
It hummed like a hive of honeybees.

1634
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:29,748
I reached in the mass for
the sweet honeycomb there.

1635
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,835
God, how I loved your hair.

1636
01:36:33,836 --> 01:36:38,090
You saw me bludgeoned by circumstance...

1637
01:36:38,173 --> 01:36:42,010
Iost, injured, hurt by chance.

1638
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:47,516
I screamed to the heavens...

1639
01:36:47,599 --> 01:36:49,643
Ioudly screamed...

1640
01:36:51,019 --> 01:36:54,648
trying to change our
nightmares into dreams.

1641
01:36:54,731 --> 01:36:58,902
The sun has come. The mists have gone.

1642
01:36:58,986 --> 01:37:02,698
We see in the distance
our long way home.

1643
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,908
I was yours to have...

1644
01:37:04,992 --> 01:37:07,744
and you were always mine.

1645
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:10,497
We loved each other in and out...

1646
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:14,918
in and out, in and out of time.

1647
01:37:33,061 --> 01:37:36,315
It seems like forever

1648
01:37:36,398 --> 01:37:40,569
That I have waited for you

1649
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:45,115
In a world of disappointment

1650
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:47,993
One thing is true

1651
01:37:49,786 --> 01:37:52,289
God has blessed me

1652
01:37:53,582 --> 01:37:57,503
And he's blessed you, too

1653
01:37:57,586 --> 01:38:01,632
In a world of lonely people

1654
01:38:01,715 --> 01:38:04,218
I found you

1655
01:38:05,093 --> 01:38:09,139
Just take my hand

1656
01:38:09,223 --> 01:38:12,100
And hold me close

1657
01:38:13,727 --> 01:38:17,147
And don't

1658
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:22,110
Let me go

1659
01:38:22,152 --> 01:38:25,113
You for me

1660
01:38:25,197 --> 01:38:29,785
And me for you

1661
01:38:29,868 --> 01:38:32,454
Together we'll make

1662
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:37,918
One

1663
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:41,588
We were once strangers

1664
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:44,341
All by ourselves

1665
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:48,887
Living, living alone

1666
01:38:48,971 --> 01:38:52,349
With no one else

1667
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:56,770
But here you are

1668
01:38:58,147 --> 01:39:01,525
And it's so, so sweet

1669
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:03,277
God must have done this

1670
01:39:03,318 --> 01:39:04,444
Frankie.

1671
01:39:05,404 --> 01:39:08,907
Made you for me

1672
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:10,284
Today, this is special.

1673
01:39:10,325 --> 01:39:12,536
I was prepared to speak
for Lisa and Carlos...

1674
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:14,830
but since I'm a little ill-prepared...

1675
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:18,000
maybe you should just
say what's on your heart.

1676
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:29,136
I never...

1677
01:39:30,554 --> 01:39:32,890
thought that I could
meet someone like you.

1678
01:39:34,349 --> 01:39:36,351
You are my friend...

1679
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,731
you are my smile...

1680
01:39:42,524 --> 01:39:44,735
you are my everything.

1681
01:39:48,572 --> 01:39:51,033
You are a breath-taking reflection...

1682
01:39:51,116 --> 01:39:53,535
of God's heart for me...

1683
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:56,872
of how he pursued me...

1684
01:39:56,955 --> 01:39:58,665
and loved me...

1685
01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:03,420
even when I didn't love myself.

1686
01:40:06,048 --> 01:40:07,883
You held my hand in the darkness...

1687
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:12,012
and you pulled me out into the light.

1688
01:40:16,391 --> 01:40:19,978
I love you, Frankie Henderson.

1689
01:40:20,062 --> 01:40:21,730
You are my light...

1690
01:40:25,651 --> 01:40:28,070
and it doesn't matter what happens...

1691
01:40:28,153 --> 01:40:30,322
in this life...

1692
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:33,992
as long as you're with me.

1693
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:38,497
When I look at you...

1694
01:40:43,127 --> 01:40:44,670
I know that there's a God...

1695
01:40:50,467 --> 01:40:53,220
and that he loved me so much...

1696
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:57,099
that he took the time to create you...

1697
01:41:00,269 --> 01:41:01,311
just for me.

1698
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,817
I love you...

1699
01:41:08,735 --> 01:41:10,279
past my mind...

1700
01:41:10,362 --> 01:41:12,406
beyond my heart.

1701
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:17,494
I love you for my soul...

1702
01:41:22,458 --> 01:41:24,209
and that's the space...

1703
01:41:24,293 --> 01:41:27,254
where only you and God dwell.

1704
01:41:30,132 --> 01:41:31,633
After that...

1705
01:41:31,717 --> 01:41:34,553
there is nothing to say.

1706
01:41:34,636 --> 01:41:36,221
Kiss your bride.

1707
01:42:17,304 --> 01:42:19,389
You really are a beautiful couple.

1708
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:24,353
Really beautiful.

1709
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:40,345
Yeah, you're on the mark.

1710
01:43:46,602 --> 01:43:47,769
You must be Carlos, man.

1711
01:43:47,853 --> 01:43:49,021
- Yes.
- How you doin'?

1712
01:43:49,104 --> 01:43:51,064
- I'm good.
- Good to meet you.

1713
01:43:51,106 --> 01:43:52,524
Is it that obvious?

1714
01:43:52,608 --> 01:43:53,734
What, that you're Carlos?

1715
01:43:53,817 --> 01:43:55,068
- I'm Carlos.
- Yeah, it is.

1716
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:56,778
- I'm Carlos.
- I can tell.

1717
01:43:56,862 --> 01:43:58,780
Maybe we can get this take again.

1718
01:43:58,822 --> 01:44:00,491
- Yeah.
- Ok. All right.

1719
01:44:04,286 --> 01:44:06,663
And, action.

1720
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:11,460
Excuse me.

1721
01:44:11,502 --> 01:44:14,671
I'm a little old. I can't hold it.

1722
01:44:14,755 --> 01:44:16,590
That's OK.

1723
01:44:24,348 --> 01:44:26,767
They tell me you're gonna
take her out somewhere.

1724
01:44:26,809 --> 01:44:28,435
Yep. I'm gonna take her out.

1725
01:44:28,477 --> 01:44:30,103
Oh. Where you goin'?

1726
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:32,105
Just this place around the corner.

1727
01:44:32,147 --> 01:44:34,066
It's a nice Italian place.

1728
01:44:34,149 --> 01:44:36,985
That ain't where you goin'.
You're going to a poetry bar.

1729
01:44:37,027 --> 01:44:39,029
That's true. We're
going to a poetry bar.

1730
01:44:39,112 --> 01:44:41,114
- Let's start over.
- Ok.

1731
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:45,327
Read the script next time.

1732
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,414
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1733
01:45:09,268 --> 01:45:10,435
I don't even know where you at.

1734
01:45:14,523 --> 01:45:15,607
Am I loose enough?

1735
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:29,454
The year is 2045...

1736
01:45:29,538 --> 01:45:31,790
and I am Michael Jackson...

1737
01:45:31,874 --> 01:45:34,626
and we're on tour with my brothers.

1738
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:37,045
Here's my brother, Jermaine.

1739
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,174
Do you remember him?

1740
01:45:40,215 --> 01:45:42,217
This is my brother Tito.

1741
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:45,971
And you gotta remember little Janet.

1742
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:50,350
Ya'll still here at
the movies? It's over.

1743
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:53,854
You can go home now. You enjoy yourself?

1744
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:56,356
Lord have mercy.

1745
01:45:56,398 --> 01:45:58,442
Honey, don't bring your
baby to the movie no more.

1746
01:45:58,525 --> 01:45:59,568
That is rude as hell.

1747
01:45:59,651 --> 01:46:01,695
People trying to watch
this movie and you bring...

1748
01:46:01,737 --> 01:46:04,573
that crying child in here
through the whole movie.

1749
01:46:04,656 --> 01:46:06,200
What is your problem? I hate that.

1750
01:46:07,409 --> 01:46:09,411
Why they sell popcorn
at a movie theater?

1751
01:46:09,495 --> 01:46:11,413
That is the loudest food you can have.

1752
01:46:11,455 --> 01:46:12,831
Why don't ya'll get something else?

1753
01:46:12,915 --> 01:46:15,876
Get something that don't cause no noise.

1754
01:46:17,294 --> 01:46:18,796
And look at Junebug back in the back...

1755
01:46:18,879 --> 01:46:20,547
with a video camera
trying to bootleg it.

1756
01:46:20,589 --> 01:46:22,591
You know they waiting
on to get something.

1757
01:46:22,674 --> 01:46:24,384
You see her over there?

1758
01:46:24,468 --> 01:46:26,678
You see her?

1759
01:46:28,764 --> 01:46:30,140
That dress is too small.

1760
01:46:32,059 --> 01:46:34,228
Pull your pants up, honey.
Them ain't lowriders.

1761
01:46:36,021 --> 01:46:37,606
Her butt just too big.

1762
01:46:37,689 --> 01:46:39,233
She couldn't get 'em up.

1763
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:42,319
Lord have mercy. All right, go on.

1764
01:46:42,402 --> 01:46:44,571
The movie over. I'll see you
later. Napisy pobrane z NapisZone
