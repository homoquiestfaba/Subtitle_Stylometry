00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,750
{\an8}Welcome, my young entrepreneurs.

2
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,791
They say there are no shortcuts in life.

3
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,958
They say nothing is free.

4
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,500
But I'm telling you right now,
the deal I'm going to give you

5
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,458
is the closest thing to free
you'll ever get.

6
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,583
You all heard the rumors.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

7
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,583
Now's your chance to see it up close.

8
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,291
I give you the product for free.

9
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,250
You sell it.

10
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,750
Sounds too good to be true.

11
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,666
That's because it is.

12
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,875
We'll only be in New Orleans
for a little while,

13
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,375
so get out there and sell.

14
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,125
What's it called?

15
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,791
You ask a lot of questions.

16
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,125
Yeah, I'm Newt.

17
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,458
Newt.

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,333
This...

19
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,166
is Power.

20
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,541
<i>Orleans Parish, 9-1-1.</i>

21
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,041
<i>My friend is having some</i>
<i>strange reaction right now.</i>

22
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,291
<i>She just took a pill.</i>

23
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,625
<i>This is what I'm telling you, man,</i>
<i>he lifted the freaking car over his head.</i>

24
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,583
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

25
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,541
<i>I don't know how to describe this,</i>
<i>but I just seen some weird shit.</i>

26
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,083
<i>Look, I don't see no blood at all.</i>
<i>No blood.</i>

27
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,375
<i>9-1-1, where is your emergency?</i>

28
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,458
<i>Nine-one-one.</i>

29
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,333
Bird!

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,833
Come on, man. There's no bird.

31
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,333
We shouldn't even be here right now.

32
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,541
Bird!

33
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,541
- Come on, bird!
- You're not even listening.

34
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,208
All right, all right.

35
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,708
Say, bro, let me see your hands.

36
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,041
Hands, now!

37
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,291
You don't got no gun.

38
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,416
You wanna find out?

39
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,666
Whoa. How much?

40
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,083
- Five hundred.
- Five hundred?

41
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,791
Are you serious?

42
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,791
Supply and demand. You want it or not?

43
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,208
I wanna climb the walls.

44
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,541
That's not how it works.

45
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,958
You take it,
for five minutes, you get what you get.

46
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,250
Instead of selling it to us,
why don't you just give it to us?

47
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,291
- Don't touch me! Get off!
- Take that stupid mask off!

48
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,125
No!

49
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,375
Leave me alone! Get off!

50
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,375
Get off me! Give me my bag!

51
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,125
Give me my bag!

52
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,750
- Stop! How many has she got?
- Just three.

53
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,250
But I bet this chick has more.

54
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,916
Gentlemen, on your knees,
hands behind your head.

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,541
NOPD.

56
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,458
I see we have a lady here, as well.
You too, ma'am.

57
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,458
Hands, very good. Thank you.

58
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,791
Now, how's everybody doing tonight?

59
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,833
You sure you want to do that, young man?

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,708
You ever taken one of those before?

61
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,666
You haven't, have you? I can tell.

62
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,750
Now, I bet you've heard
it can make you fast, make you strong.

63
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,541
Make this a fair fight, even though
I got a gun pointed at your face.

64
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,583
Just twist it, Tommy.

65
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,333
But that's only
if you happen to have a good Power.

66
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,625
Not everybody does.

67
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,416
Some people take it and just blow up.

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,750
- I don't wanna do this anymore, man.
- Shut up.

69
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,458
So the question is, what's your power?

70
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,291
Might be good, might be bad, nobody knows.

71
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,541
Take the pill, Tommy.

72
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,458
Take it.

73
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,208
Go ahead.

74
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,791
I wanna see what happens.

75
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,291
You boys are lucky
I only have one pair of cuffs.

76
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,041
I'd bring you all in.

77
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,375
You can go now.

78
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,125
Go!

79
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,333
Man, you crazy.

80
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,541
You okay?

81
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,166
I had it.

82
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,083
That is not what I saw.

83
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,541
So what, you practice that in the mirror?

84
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,125
Yeah, you did.

85
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,666
I bet you had your gun out too.

86
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,916
Pointed at yourself, talking all hard
like you Clint Eastwood.

87
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,875
You don't know me.

88
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:56,833
Yeah, I do.

89
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,875
What do you know about Clint Eastwood?

90
00:05:58,958 --> 00:05:59,875
I know enough.

91
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,125
What you seen him in?

92
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,375
- <i>The Bridges of Madison County.</i>
- That's actually a pretty good one.

93
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,000
By the way,
it's 500 for that pill in your pocket.

94
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,625
The same stuff as last time?

95
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,083
- Yeah, what else it gonna be?
- I don't know.

96
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,250
Did you get it from the same guy
as last time?

97
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,458
Come on, you either gonna be a cop
or a customer.

98
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,750
It's not that simple.

99
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,166
Bad guys using this stuff

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,583
to take out whole precincts of cops
single-handed.

101
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,958
I'm just trying
to level the playing field.

102
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,833
Be careful with that.

103
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:31,750
Yeah, thanks.

104
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,333
- What do you think of the bike?
- It's an all right bike.

105
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,708
Well, you want it or not?

106
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,708
- I mean, I brought it here for you.
- You lying.

107
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,333
No, you said it was your birthday
the other day, right?

108
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,125
- That was a month ago.
- Okay then, you know what? Never mind.

109
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,375
- No, I mean, I want the bike.
- Yeah, you sure?

110
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,375
Yeah.

111
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,791
- Why the seat made out of duct tape?
- It was nicest one at the impound lot.

112
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,375
- It's mine?
- Get on!

113
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,000
Damn!

114
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,791
<i>Good morning, New Orleans!</i>

115
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,958
<i>I have a caller on the line.
Tell me exactly what you saw.</i>

116
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,625
<i>Man, I saw a kid running</i>
<i>down Poydras last night,</i>

117
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,750
<i>35 miles per hour.</i>

118
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,375
<i>Did you have a speed gun</i>
<i>on this guy?</i>

119
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,291
<i>Man, if the speed limit is 25,</i>
<i>he passed it down cold.</i>

120
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,916
<i>I'm telling you, he was on something.</i>

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,041
<i>Bruh, it sounds like</i>
<i>you might have been on something.</i>

122
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,750
<i>Wayne, you can make fun all you want,</i>

123
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,375
<i>but I'm telling you, something going on.</i>

124
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,458
<i>There's videos. I saw one the other day,</i>

125
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,583
<i>a kid jumped straight off the roof
of the casino and just walked away.</i>

126
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,833
<i>Maybe there's a little conspiracy going...</i>

127
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,041
Who is it?

128
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,541
Looking for Newt.

129
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,041
I ain't ask who you're looking for,
I said, "Who is it?"

130
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,041
I understand that, sir.
I'm a friend of Simon's.

131
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,208
I'm from Tampa.

132
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,541
He sent me here to talk to you.
Maybe you wanna do some business.

133
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,333
Come where I can see you.

134
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,083
Merry Christmas.

135
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,416
You alone?

136
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,041
Aren't we all?

137
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,375
Let me see your hands.

138
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,333
I got a box in my hands.

139
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,625
You wanna see my hands,
or put the box down?

140
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,916
- What you want?
- Yeah...

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,500
- No.
- Which one? Box down, hands up?

142
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,125
Put the box down and get your hands up.

143
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,208
- Okay, I'm with you. Box down.
- Yeah, just...

144
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,625
Now, slow, real slow now.

145
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,458
Yeah, slow, everything's slow.

146
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,708
If you want, you can call Simon.
He'll verify who I am.

147
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,375
Tell him that the Major's here to see you.

148
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,250
The Major.

149
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,125
Say, bruh.

150
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,208
I'ma go make that call.
You stay right there.

151
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,458
I wouldn't do that.

152
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,666
Newt.

153
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,458
I don't wanna hurt you.

154
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,833
I don't wanna hurt nobody.

155
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,916
Just need some information, that's all.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,708
Tell me where you're getting this stuff,
and I'll get out of here.

157
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,791
You don't wanna talk?

158
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,875
All you gotta do
is tell me who your supplier is.

159
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,416
So what you think about that, Newt, huh?
We got a deal?

160
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,333
Once I get that information,

161
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,958
you can slither back to whatever hole
that you came out of, understand?

162
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,375
Listen to my voice.

163
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:12,833
Am I lying?

164
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,000
What? I know you not...

165
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,333
Get the hell out of my kitchen!

166
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,041
Oh, Lord!

167
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,250
Newt, you gonna get somebody
killed in here!

168
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,958
Where you getting this shit from?
Who's making it? Tell me the source!

169
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,041
I ain't telling you shit!

170
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,625
Tell me right now! Who's the supplier?

171
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,500
Give me one name!

172
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,500
You gonna tell me!

173
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,541
Tell me who it is!

174
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,750
Okay. Big Man.

175
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,916
- His name's Biggie.
- Speak up, son!

176
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,125
That's all I know, man!

177
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,500
- Where's he at?
- I...

178
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,208
Huh? Where's Biggie?

179
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,291
How many did you take?

180
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,166
No! Daddy! Daddy!

181
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,458
Hey, mister.

182
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,125
Is he dead?

183
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,708
He's alive, man.

184
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:49,666
Robin.

185
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:51,875
Are you up?

186
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,750
- Robin.
- Yeah.

187
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,666
You late.

188
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,541
I'm up.

189
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,750
Mmhmm.

190
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:08,958
Ma, you okay?

191
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, baby. Be right out.

192
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,541
I'll make you some soup.

193
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,458
Man, we all out.

194
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,125
Just get to school.

195
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,000
I'ma go pick some up later.

196
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,833
And your prescription too.

197
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,708
<i>The initial investigation
is indicating a home meth lab,</i>

198
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,750
<i>but we're gonna wait
until we see the full report</i>

199
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,958
<i>- before we make an assessment.</i>
- Yeah.

200
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,666
<i>It was deemed unsafe years ago.</i>

201
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,125
Isn't that where Newt hangs out?

202
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,541
Uh, I'm not sure, could be.

203
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,166
Text your cousin for me, baby.

204
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,250
That's a pretty big fire.

205
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,333
I'm sure he's fine, Ma.

206
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,583
Mmm.

207
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,375
On a scale of one to ten,
how bad is it today?

208
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,750
Seven, seven and a half.

209
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,375
- I'm sorry, Ma.
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,458
You gotta go.

211
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,541
Well, I'll come through

212
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,708
with your prescription
and your soup tonight.

213
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:03,916
My hero.

214
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:09,916
Want some company?

215
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,000
All right, then.

216
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:39,875
Hmm.

217
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,166
This is a major problem during pregnancy

218
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,375
known as FAS.

219
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,000
Birth defects caused by drinking alcohol
and using drugs while pregnant.

220
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,916
How do we prevent these birth defects?

221
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,916
- Put that up.
- Ladies.

222
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,833
I'm guessing that you're discussing
what the condition is called

223
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,791
when a child is exposed to alcohol
in the womb, right?

224
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,333
F... feeble alcohol syndrome.

225
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,833
Fetal.

226
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,875
But yes, correct.

227
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,125
Now, let's talk about prevention.

228
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,333
How do we prevent these birth defects?

229
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,833
No drugs, no alcohol.

230
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,750
Simple.
It is the only form known as FAS...

231
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,000
I know that you don't think
this stuff is serious,

232
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,291
you don't think it's important, but it is.

233
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,125
Right now,
you're getting a D in this class, Robin.

234
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,625
It's an easy class.

235
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,083
Quiet.

236
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:53,916
So since you don't seem to be worried
about your grades or graduating...

237
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,125
you must have a plan, right?

238
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,958
So what is that plan, Miss Reilly?

239
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,458
Rap.

240
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,083
She'll rap.

241
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,208
I see.

242
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,291
Well, then,
why don't you get up and rap for us?

243
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,833
Make me believe that you've got a shot,

244
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,375
and I'll give you a C for the year.

245
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh!

246
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,833
<i>Yeah! That's my girl.</i>

247
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,375
Sit down! Stop!

248
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,083
- Robin!
- Sit down.

249
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,666
- Robin!
- Sit down!

250
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,625
- Put her down!
- Robin!

251
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,583
Well, then.

252
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,666
You can give me that phone

253
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,666
or you can go to the office.

254
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,541
Let's get back to prevention, please.

255
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,916
There is no magic pill to fix it.

256
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,250
<i>Reports of armed robbery</i>
<i>downtown near the Savings bank.</i>

257
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:58,416
<i>All available officers please respond.</i>

258
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,458
Sir, what'd you see in there?

259
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,458
I don't know, I didn't see him.

260
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,833
He came out of nowhere.

261
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,625
It's like I was hit by a ghost.

262
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,750
By a ghost?

263
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,500
This is not right, man, you gotta...

264
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,416
Yo, captain!

265
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,333
You can't just get...
Not now, Landry. Not now.

266
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,666
You can't just come and take my shit over.

267
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,291
What's going on?

268
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,125
Armed robber, multiple hostages,
the negotiator can't make contact.

269
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,416
Why aren't we going in?

270
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,666
Pretty sure our scene just became theirs.

271
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,541
You weren't down here ten minutes ago.
What is this? What do we do?

272
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,125
This is wrong. I'm gonna remember that.
I'm gonna remember that.

273
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:43,833
What's all that?

274
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,750
We've been asked to stand down.

275
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,833
We're here in support now only.

276
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,958
Frank, this is some bullshit, man.

277
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,250
Like, if it was up to me...

278
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:58,500
Hey, buddy.

279
00:22:59,125 --> 00:22:59,958
Take a break.

280
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,208
Where are they?

281
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,625
Behind you!

282
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,500
The bags! The bags! Follow the bags!

283
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,625
Get those bags!

284
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,958
Bank units go.

285
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,750
<i>All units set up a perimeter.</i>

286
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,458
<i>Subject is male, possibly Caucasian.</i>

287
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,083
<i>Shit, I can't tell.</i>

288
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,208
Watch out!

289
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,291
You all right?

290
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,208
Hey! Hey! Out of the way! Out of the way!

291
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,666
Get out of the way! Go! Go!

292
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:03,375
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

293
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,708
Hey! NOPD! You hear me?

294
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,250
Stop the car!

295
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,000
Hey! Stop the streetcar!

296
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,083
Has anybody seen an invis...

297
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,125
Stop the streetcar!

298
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,458
You're under arrest!

299
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Stop!

300
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,291
Freeze! I can see you!

301
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,083
NOPD, you're under arrest!

302
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,791
I said freeze!

303
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,500
Freeze! Don't move.

304
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,125
Frank! Watch out!

305
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,250
Frank, stop! Stop!

306
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,125
And a small fries.

307
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,708
Scale of one to ten,
ten being the worst,

308
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:36,916
what's your pain right now?

309
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,250
- It doesn't hurt.
- Any soreness in here?

310
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,500
- No, ma'am.
- Lose consciousness?

311
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,041
For a second, I did there.

312
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,958
Look at my finger. Follow it.

313
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,750
Can you excuse us for a minute?

314
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,083
Sure.

315
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,125
Did you take a pill today?

316
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:09,375
Yes.

317
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:12,416
Put your gun and the badge on the table.

318
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:14,375
Captain.

319
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:17,291
Gun and badge on the table, now.

320
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,750
If I hadn't taken that, I'd be dead.

321
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,666
- That what you want?
- I want my police force to obey the law!

322
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,166
There are no laws on this drug!

323
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,041
They don't exist officially,
'cause every time we try to deal with it,

324
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,416
some guys in suits show up
and tell us to stop.

325
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,958
Look, I don't know who those two were
that came in today

326
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,250
and cut you off at the knees.

327
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,583
I don't know
if they're feds or military or what,

328
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:48,541
but clearly,
they have you under their thumb.

329
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,958
And I don't think you like it.

330
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,750
'Cause they don't care
about the people of this city.

331
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,458
Not like you do, not like I do,

332
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,208
and we know what happened last time
we were counting on guys in suits

333
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,875
to look out for New Orleans.

334
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,291
Now, you need to make me the bad guy,
that's fine.

335
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:07,625
But I'd be willing to bet
you know more than you're allowed to say.

336
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,250
Maybe we can work together on this,
unofficially.

337
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,083
And maybe we can do some good.

338
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,500
And isn't that our job?

339
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:18,541
<i>Captain, suspect is</i>
<i>currently being removed from the premises.</i>

340
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,916
Anybody finds you with that,
you didn't get it from me.

341
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,541
I'm told he's the source of Power.

342
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,708
We shut him down, we get our city back.

343
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,750
Who is he?

344
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,166
He's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

345
00:29:58,708 --> 00:29:59,875
You okay, honey?

346
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,541
- You need anything else?
- No, I'm fine.

347
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,166
Hmm. Yes, you are.

348
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,875
So, can I get you anything?

349
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,875
You got any hot water?

350
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:12,000
- I'll take some of that.
- Yeah. Okay, I'll get that for you.

351
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:13,666
Jessica!

352
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,041
Can I get some hot water?

353
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,833
Newt, you in there?

354
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:51,791
Newt.

355
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,875
Seriously?

356
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,333
Say, you saw who did this?

357
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:23,875
No, I just came out the door.

358
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,416
Please! Please! Wait! Get off me!

359
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,125
Help me!

360
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:03,875
<i>It's Robin. You know what to do.</i>

361
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,208
Hey, it's me.

362
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,166
I need to re-up,
so meet me in the usual spot.

363
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,416
Let me out! Please, let me out!

364
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,375
You keep kicking around in there.

365
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,958
This how we gonna do this.

366
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,750
All that kicking ain't making no sense.

367
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,166
Somebody help!

368
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,166
You in a strange man's car
in an even stranger place.

369
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,208
Help!

370
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,625
Help, please!

371
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,916
But I need to have a conversation
with you.

372
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,041
I need to be able to look...

373
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,375
I need to be able to look you in your eye.

374
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:07,041
You don't wanna calm down,

375
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,666
maybe I need to make a trip over
to 32 Park, right?

376
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,166
You know where 32 Park is?

377
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,125
Well, if I let you out
and you start crying,

378
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,916
I'ma pay a little visit to Irene.

379
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,083
Make sure she all right, huh?

380
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,333
I take it you love Irene
'cause you ain't knocking no more.

381
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:27,833
So when I open this up,

382
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,541
I want my conversation.

383
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,875
Why don't we start
from the beginning, make it simple?

384
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:40,833
What's your name?

385
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,458
- Huh?
- I'm Robin!

386
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:43,583
Oh, I can't hear you.

387
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:44,833
- What is it?
- Robin.

388
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,375
Robin.

389
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,166
You push that Power, don't you?

390
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:50,916
I don't know nothing about that...

391
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,083
- You don't know?
- No! I don't!

392
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:56,250
Maybe you'll figure it out, huh?
You stay in there until you figure it out.

393
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,750
I don't know!

394
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,041
What's the source?

395
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,375
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

396
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,083
- Maybe you know something about Newt.
- I don't... I don't know...

397
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,583
- Oh, you don't know who Newt is?
- No.

398
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,916
That's funny
because Newt be all in your phone.

399
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,500
I get weird texts from people all the time
because that's what the job is.

400
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,458
Well, let me tell you
what's even more weird.

401
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,083
- Newt ain't here no more.
- What?

402
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:18,208
So since Newt ain't here,
that leads us to... where to, huh?

403
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,708
Where to, Robin?
I need to know where the source is.

404
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,291
I don't... Believe me!

405
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,291
I said get out!

406
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,666
Why?

407
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,500
So you can advance your position in life.

408
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:34,625
Who is that?

409
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,083
- Hmm? Look closer, is that Biggie?
- I don't know.

410
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,791
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know.

411
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,208
Oh, you on these streets,
you don't know shit.

412
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,125
I know you're scared.

413
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,333
I know you're feeling
like fight or flight,

414
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,916
but I'ma tell you right now,
you just breathe and get through it

415
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,333
because listen, you don't know who I am
and what I'm about,

416
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,833
but I got to find that source.

417
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,833
I need to get
to the top of the food chain.

418
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,791
But you keep messing around with me
and acting like you don't know shit,

419
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,875
I'm gonna knock your ass out,
and then I'm gonna go kill your mother.

420
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,833
I'ma kill Irene.

421
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:09,791
Look me in my eyes.

422
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,208
Am I lying?

423
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,958
So tell me your decision.

424
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,250
There's our buyer.

425
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:35,541
You trust her?

426
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:38,416
She's connected to every cartel
in South America.

427
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,333
She's the real deal.

428
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:42,125
And the money?

429
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,166
You'll get it.

430
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:47,500
Then our backers will see
what the rest of us have already seen.

431
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,041
What's that?

432
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,791
That we're working for the woman
who's gonna change the world.

433
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,416
Ready to go.

434
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,666
<i>Bienvenidos.</i>

435
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:05,333
Welcome. I see you packed light.

436
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,125
I was expecting...

437
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,708
duffel bags.

438
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:10,875
The money is here...

439
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,416
if the product lives up to its reputation.

440
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,333
Product?

441
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,958
It is not just a product.

442
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,208
These pills will topple governments.

443
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:25,791
You're about to become
the most powerful woman in South America.

444
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:29,708
In that case,
I look forward to your demonstration.

445
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,375
Hey, I see what you doin'.

446
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:52,625
Give me this.

447
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:53,958
You do what I told you.

448
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:55,958
No messing around.

449
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,333
<i>Operator.</i>

450
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:01,250
Hi.

451
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,833
I was told to call this number
if I ever had a problem.

452
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,375
<i>Go to Hong Kong Market off of Patterson.</i>

453
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,958
<i>Go to the back and ask for alligator wine.</i>

454
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:11,375
<i>Come alone.</i>

455
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:13,291
Okay.

456
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,666
You're gonna go meet whoever's in there,

457
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,708
you're gonna tell them
what we talked about.

458
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:28,208
You're gonna tell them that you saw me
and that I left.

459
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,458
- No...
- And if they ask...

460
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:33,000
No, you said point you in a direction,
that's a direction.

461
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,625
You ever hear of a mine rat?

462
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:39,333
- It sound like a rat that get blown up.
- Well, that's what you are.

463
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,708
You're my mine rat.

464
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,375
Look, I was just trying to make ends meet.
I'm just a kid, I'm...

465
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,958
I know what you trying to do!

466
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:51,208
You out here in these streets dealing,
you ain't no damn kid.

467
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,958
You gave that up.

468
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,291
You can't keep playing
that whole "I'm just a child" card, okay?

469
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,125
Let's make it happen.

470
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,083
Yes, sir.

471
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,708
Excuse me.

472
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,791
Excuse me.

473
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,083
Alligator wine?

474
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,083
That's not a thing.

475
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,833
Can you just ask somebody?

476
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,125
He said wait here.

477
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,291
Excuse me,
could you help me out with this?

478
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,250
What?

479
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,916
- Is it spicy, is it mild?
- I don't know what the fuck it is.

480
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,208
I don't work here.

481
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:46,166
Watch your step.

482
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:50,708
Okay, why don't you have a seat?

483
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,041
How'd you get the number?

484
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:58,833
Newt gave it to me.

485
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,416
You're a dealer.

486
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,208
Yeah, he gave it to me
in case something went wrong.

487
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:04,958
Newt's dead.

488
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:06,916
I know.

489
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
How'd that happen?

490
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,333
There's this guy.

491
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,791
He calls himself "The Major."

492
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,041
He killed him.

493
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,833
Then he threw me in his trunk.

494
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,500
He's right outside.

495
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:28,958
Can I go?

496
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,333
You should stay right here.

497
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,541
This is the safest place for you
right now.

498
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,500
You Biggie?

499
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,583
I'm not Biggie.

500
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:47,166
Biggie works in sales.
This is distribution.

501
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,583
- Talk to me.
- Listen, I can...

502
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,791
I don't want to talk to any middle men.
Already did that.

503
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:56,375
You don't tell me where Biggie is,
I'll cut your fucking head off.

504
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,500
Start the truck!

505
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,166
Let me out!

506
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,375
Hey!

507
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:41,833
Hey, Robin!

508
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,333
You still in there?

509
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,458
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,500
Don't worry, okay? I'm gonna come...

511
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,250
Everything's okay.

512
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:25,916
Tracy.

513
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:27,791
Baby.

514
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,541
It's so good to see you.

515
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,000
What? What?

516
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,000
Cover your ears.

517
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,375
What's that?

518
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,500
They're logging Powers.
There's chips in every capsule.

519
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,916
The government won't let them test it,
so they test it on us.

520
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,875
The people that you're selling to,

521
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,500
they're the lab rats.

522
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:13,958
What's all that?

523
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,166
It's a demonstration for potential buyers.

524
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,791
It means they're done with New Orleans.
It means I'm running out of time.

525
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,041
I gotta go there.

526
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,333
You gotta take me there.

527
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,333
Tracy, take...

528
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:09,875
Help!

529
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:12,458
Help!

530
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:16,041
Help!

531
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,791
Robin, I need...

532
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:08,291
Please.

533
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,041
You killed my cousin.

534
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,125
He ODed. I didn't kill him.

535
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:23,208
I got money.

536
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,583
Please.

537
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:30,666
I'm just trying...
I'm just trying to find my daughter.

538
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,375
Yo, chill.

539
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:04,458
Yo, you need to calm down.

540
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,875
You fell out, I brought you to the vet.
My mom work here.

541
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,208
You did this?

542
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,541
Yeah.

543
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,166
But now I need to finish the exit wound.

544
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:23,500
You gonna let me do it or not?

545
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,166
I guess that's a yes.

546
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,875
Wait, wait, wait.

547
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:38,958
What?

548
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:40,625
Y'all work on humans?

549
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:41,875
Nope.

550
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,333
Ah.

551
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:46,833
I didn't even do nothing yet.

552
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,250
There a lot of girls
that look just like her!

553
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,291
Mrs. Reilly, do you want
your daughter to end up dead?

554
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,791
I already told you,
I don't know where she is.

555
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:21,416
She was supposed to be home hours ago.
What...

556
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,666
With all due respect, officer,
there's a lot of girls...

557
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,583
This could get very ugly
for your daughter

558
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:28,625
- and for you.
- Are you sure it was her?

559
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,041
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

560
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,583
Are you sure
you haven't seen this man before?

561
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:50,250
No, I told you I don't know
what you talking about.

562
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,375
That's funny.

563
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:55,000
We have surveillance footage
of your daughter with this man tonight

564
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,958
committing crimes
about five miles from here.

565
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,000
Are you sure?

566
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,791
This could get a whole lot uglier for you.

567
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:03,791
Honey, bear. Are we all out
of that one hippie shampoo that...

568
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:06,291
Whoa! What the shit's going on here?
Who the hell are you guys?

569
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:07,625
What you doing in my bathroom?

570
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,083
- We're the police. Who are you?
- Man, I live here.

571
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:13,375
Babe, I'm sorry I was in your shower.
The pressure's so much better in yours.

572
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:14,500
Can you come over here?

573
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,666
I'm really sorry
it had to happen that way.

574
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,666
Robin sent me.

575
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,666
Let me just handle these guys, okay?

576
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:21,375
Officers.

577
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,958
What precinct
did you guys say you're from?

578
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:24,875
They didn't say.

579
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,708
Sir, Mrs. Reilly and her daughter

580
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:29,333
seem to be the only residents
registered to this address.

581
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:30,291
I see.

582
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:33,708
So now because I'm not
in your little database, I can't...

583
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,708
Bless you.

584
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,125
Is there a cat in here?

585
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,333
I thought you said you lived here.

586
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,916
Yes, I do, sir.

587
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:43,416
Is that so hard to believe? Why?

588
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:45,375
Is it because I'm white?

589
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:47,708
Are you assuming
that me and this beautiful Black woman

590
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,416
wouldn't be able to share a happy home?

591
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,750
You wanna say that on camera?

592
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,500
- Babe, where's your phone?
- Got it.

593
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,500
All right.
Well, let's just see about this.

594
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,458
And we are live streaming.

595
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:57,916
Now, let's just get this on record.

596
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,041
Honey, did either of these men
show you a warrant

597
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,625
when they came into our house?

598
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:02,958
No, they did not.

599
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,416
Uh-huh. And did either of them
show you a badge?

600
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,125
No! Can I see your badges?

601
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:08,625
Gentlemen.

602
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:10,458
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Reilly.

603
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,208
I'm sorry, do I know you?

604
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,416
You got any duct tape?

605
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,750
Duct tape? What?

606
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,166
Stop! Who are you?

607
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:27,708
My name is Detective Frank Shaver, NOPD.

608
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,208
Can I see your badge?

609
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,791
Well, I don't have it on me.

610
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,041
Where do you have it?

611
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,666
Mrs. Reilly, your daughter and I
have had a professional friendship

612
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,375
for a little over half a year now.

613
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:39,666
She's a very smart
and good-hearted young person,

614
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,833
but she is mixed up in some things
she shouldn't be,

615
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:43,375
and I am trying to help her.

616
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,625
Thank you. I'm gonna need this too.

617
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:49,791
Where's yours?

618
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,166
So what's your power?

619
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:07,625
I don't even know.

620
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,041
Come on. You ain't tried it?

621
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,041
Honestly...

622
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:13,541
I saw a girl OD.

623
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,416
You know, on the streets,

624
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,541
they're talking about
how it'll give you superpowers,

625
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:19,416
but not about
how one hit could kill you.

626
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:21,291
Yeah.

627
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,875
Well, if you're so spooked,

628
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,666
why you still in the game?

629
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,708
What happened to getting good grades
and staying in school?

630
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,750
Yo, I wish I could get good grades.

631
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:35,583
Go to school, get to college,
get some fancy-ass job.

632
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,208
But I need money now.

633
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:38,583
Everybody need money now.

634
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,125
Well, my mother has diabetes now.

635
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,041
And we don't got no health insurance.

636
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:46,416
And she needs surgery, the expensive kind,
so what else am I supposed to do?

637
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,666
Oh, that's easy.

638
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,250
- What?
- Go to the Army.

639
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:54,458
- What, it don't trip you up killing fools?
- Yeah, it tripped me up.

640
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:55,916
But that was my skill set.

641
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:59,750
And what did the system do?
It took advantage of me.

642
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:03,791
But I know now I got to work the system
harder than it's working me.

643
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,541
That's what you gotta do.

644
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,750
You're young, you're Black,
you're a woman.

645
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,875
The system is designed
to swallow you whole.

646
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:17,125
You gotta find out what you do
better than anybody else and rock that.

647
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:21,208
So what you gonna do? Hmm?

648
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:23,416
How you gonna leave your mark?

649
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,041
I rap.

650
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:32,000
Oh.

651
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,583
I'm sorry.
Well, what's your rap name then, huh?

652
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:36,833
What you gonna be, the next Cardi B?

653
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,083
Huh? Cardi C?

654
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,541
Well, go ahead and spit then.

655
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,541
You say you rap, let me hear one line.

656
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,625
Huh? You can't spit one line?

657
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,416
I don't like doing it in front of people.

658
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,500
How you gonna to be a rapper
if you got stage fright?

659
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:54,250
You know what I think? Most time,
people don't wanna do something

660
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:56,250
is 'cause they're probably just wack
at it.

661
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,000
If you wack, just say you wack.

662
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,375
Fine, give me a word.

663
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,833
Give you a word? What you talking about?

664
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:04,833
I'm gonna go off the top, give me a word.

665
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,083
Oh, you that good, huh?

666
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:10,291
Feline.

667
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:14,750
Feline.

668
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,000
Give me another word.

669
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,333
Seismograph.

670
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:02,291
Antibiotic.

671
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:05,541
Antibiotic.

672
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,000
Ooh...

673
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,458
You smoked that.

674
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:37,625
All right.

675
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,166
You're good, damn good.

676
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:42,541
That's your power.

677
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:45,208
You take that, you leverage that,

678
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,583
you use your power
to take the system down.

679
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:49,500
All right.

680
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:51,750
And what's this?

681
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:53,791
You gotta take four of them.

682
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:55,416
This says for dogs.

683
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:58,916
Yeah, well, you a big dog.

684
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:23,583
Well, where you going now?

685
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,208
- Remember that guy in the picture?
- Yeah.

686
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:26,416
Gotta find him.

687
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,750
He took something from me.
I gotta get it back.

688
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,625
Something or someone?

689
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:36,541
- We ain't done here.
- Give me...

690
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,041
Listen, don't press your luck.

691
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:42,333
I could navigate for you. You're going
to where the dots on the screen is.

692
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:43,416
I can take you there.

693
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,125
For ten grand.

694
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:47,208
Why the hell would I pay you $10,000
for anything?

695
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:50,333
Medical expenses,
keeping your ass alive, kidnapping fee.

696
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:51,666
Give me those keys.

697
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,750
I'd say I done you a lot of solids here.

698
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,875
All right.

699
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,041
- Two.
- Five.

700
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:18,125
So, this is your daughter, Tracy.

701
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,125
Yeah.

702
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:25,000
She look like you.

703
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,958
And you think that guy with the beard
took her?

704
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:32,208
You ever hear of Teleios?

705
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,458
No.

706
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,583
What's that?

707
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,541
Defense contractor.

708
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:41,416
They were the ones who cracked the codes
back in the day.

709
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:43,833
Grabbed a bunch of Rangers,

710
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:46,125
put 'em all in the room,
filled them up with radiation.

711
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,958
Messed with their genes.

712
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:52,791
Tried to turn us into superheroes.

713
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:55,083
Why'd they wanna make superheroes?

714
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,583
They didn't. Not really.

715
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:59,541
'Cause in the real world,
the power goes to where it always goes,

716
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:01,791
to the people that already have it.

717
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:05,625
Okay. So, what's your power?

718
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:07,541
I know you took it.

719
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:13,750
I tried it once.

720
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:16,666
Damn near killed me, hurt a lot of people.

721
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,625
So I said
I'm not trying that shit no more.

722
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:24,875
A few years later, Tracy came along.

723
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,416
I knew she was different though.

724
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:32,166
When she was young,
she never got sick or anything like that.

725
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,583
As she got older, she got stronger.

726
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,208
She exhibited symptoms of...

727
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:40,666
powers.

728
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,416
But she never had to take a pill.

729
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:44,250
Fetal alcohol syndrome.

730
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,791
If you got, like, beaucoup shit
in your system,

731
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,500
maybe it got passed down to her.

732
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:51,708
Oh, okay.
Yeah, you hood, but you smart, huh?

733
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:55,500
Anyway, when Teleios caught wind of Tracy,

734
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:58,208
they wanted to experiment on her
like they did on me.

735
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,791
And that's when we just took off.

736
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,000
I'm sorry.

737
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:07,541
Are you okay?

738
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,916
Put your seat belt on.

739
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,583
- I got my seat belt on.
- No, you don't. Put your seat belt on!

740
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:14,083
Somebody's following us.

741
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:17,833
- Nobody's following us.
- Hold on.

742
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:20,916
- Keep your head down.
- Okay, okay, okay!

743
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,125
This voice,
do what I tell you to do, okay?

744
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:30,041
Daddy, watch out!

745
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:44,875
Daddy!

746
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:46,416
Trace! No!

747
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,125
Tracy!

748
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:49,416
Daddy!

749
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,541
Daddy! Daddy!

750
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:54,208
Tracy!

751
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:55,291
Hey!

752
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,583
Art?

753
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:58,416
You okay?

754
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,416
I mean, this is the spot.

755
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:26,875
It's the spot.

756
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:39,708
So, there's that guy.

757
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:40,875
What's the plan now?

758
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:42,041
Babe, come on.

759
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,750
- I'm coming.
- Come on, come on.

760
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,208
You know what? Sometimes,
the plan just walk right up on you.

761
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:48,250
Know what I'm saying?
That's what I'm trying...

762
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,458
Hey, man, I'm sorry,
you got a light on you, man?

763
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:52,291
- Watch it.
- No, be nice.

764
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,041
You gonna act like that, huh?

765
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,333
Your girl got you feeling good?
She look good, man.

766
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:01,000
Kidnapping fee.

767
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,166
So what you see?

768
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,708
I see some fancy clothes.

769
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:11,083
Stuck-up guy.

770
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:13,041
- Stuck-up guy with a gun.
- With a gun.

771
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:16,083
Man, they definitely
ain't gonna cash no checks, you heard?

772
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,125
No, not at all.

773
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,708
All right, that's all I need.

774
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,375
Yo, yo.

775
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,250
- What?
- What you doing?

776
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,208
I thought we was like Batman and Robin.

777
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:28,750
We ain't Batman and Robin,
that's a movie, this is real life.

778
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,333
Man, I got your blood on me.

779
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,166
- We doing this.
- Listen.

780
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:35,000
You just hang here
and wait till I get back, all right?

781
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,833
Thanks.

782
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:57,833
Hey.

783
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,833
Man, glad to be in here.

784
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:02,083
I'm on the list.

785
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:06,125
- Oh, man! What's up, man?
- Can I help you?

786
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,041
Nico!

787
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,250
- Man, look.
- It's me. Ain't you Nico?

788
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:10,958
I ain't no Nico, this a private party.

789
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,500
No. You got the wrong spot, man.

790
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:14,208
No, I know I got the right spot.

791
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:17,416
You're not on this list, man.
It's a private party. You got to roll out.

792
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,125
Yeah, that's my name right there.

793
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:31,125
Welcome to Project Power.

794
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,333
Over the last months,
we've been going from city to city

795
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:39,375
in a kind of a...
let's call them clinical trials.

796
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,666
Our footprint is small,

797
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,375
and we move on quickly
to avoid unwanted oversight.

798
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:46,166
Our goal is simple.

799
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,000
The next evolution of the human species.

800
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:52,041
That's where you come in.

801
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:56,708
<i>With your financing, Teleios could become
the most powerful company in the world.</i>

802
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,750
What's in it for you?

803
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:02,916
It's in the headline.

804
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,833
Power.

805
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,958
Power to level the playing field.

806
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,708
Or, if you like, destroy it entirely.

807
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,083
Power to create chaos.

808
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:15,500
Power to renegotiate your reality.

809
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:17,500
One day, you won't even need a pill.

810
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,333
Pretty words.

811
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:21,666
Be more specific.

812
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:27,583
Sure. Let me tell you
about my friend the little lizard.

813
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:33,458
A healer who can stitch himself up
and even regrow what he lost.

814
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:38,083
Hands, feet, eyes,
unfathomably complex structures.

815
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:42,833
The octopus camouflages herself
against the sea floor.

816
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:47,083
The wolverine frog breaks its own bones
to use as weapons.

817
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:50,208
They see in the dark,
they dislocate their bones.

818
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,041
They turn water into plasma.

819
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:55,916
They punch, they strangle,
they thermoregulate.

820
01:01:56,458 --> 01:02:00,333
Evolution has given animals
countless abilities we can only dream of.

821
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:03,166
So much power, <i>por favor.</i>

822
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,958
All the genetic potential
hidden in our DNA

823
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,916
just waiting to be released.

824
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,458
With your investment,

825
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,791
one day, a pill that lasts forever.

826
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:15,875
Stop wishing.

827
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,166
Start doing.

828
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:21,208
Find your power.

829
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,250
Yes, well...

830
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,291
Results may vary.

831
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:33,875
But as we work to a compound
that we fully control,

832
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,000
we have the tank.

833
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:42,208
Hey, Frank.

834
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,250
What you doing here?

835
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,000
Looking for you. Your mom is worried sick.

836
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,416
- Is she okay?
- Yes, she's okay.

837
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:50,250
Where's he?

838
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:52,958
I don't know.

839
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,208
Listen, don't bullshit me right now.

840
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:57,000
- I'm not.
- Are you protecting him?

841
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,416
- No.
- Why are you protecting...

842
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,625
This is a bad guy.

843
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:02,666
Why is he a bad guy?
Because he's done some bad things?

844
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,458
What about you? You do bad things too!

845
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:07,666
That is almost a good point,
but the bad things that I have done...

846
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,416
He's just looking for his daughter.

847
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,833
Everything he's doing,
he's doing it for her.

848
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:14,375
- That sound like a bad guy to you?
- That's what he told you?

849
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,166
That's what I know.

850
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:21,541
Look, I'm sorry that you miss your dad,

851
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,750
- but he's telling you a story...
- Don't do me like that...

852
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,208
He's not here looking for his daughter.
He's setting up shop.

853
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:28,583
- You think he's the source of Power?
- Yes!

854
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:30,541
Well, he's not. He's trying to stop it.

855
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:33,583
Uh-huh. Okay. If that's true,
and by the way, I don't think it is,

856
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:35,458
but if it is,
then he should be helping me.

857
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:38,208
If it's not true, then he's lying to you
and he's dangerous

858
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:41,541
and I need to bring him in. Either way,
you should tell me where he is.

859
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:47,125
Ladies, gentlemen,
the moment you've traveled so far to see.

860
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:51,083
- What's gonna happen to me?
- Don't worry.

861
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,458
This tank is completely safe.

862
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,416
They have one at the CIA.

863
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,750
Twist to activate.

864
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:13,458
Yes.

865
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,291
How exciting, my friends.

866
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:37,458
You're about to witness a very rare power.

867
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,541
Thermoregulation.

868
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,375
This one can get a bit intense.

869
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:43,083
Let me talk to you a sec.

870
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:45,291
Let's make sure she stays comfortable.

871
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:50,750
Voilà.

872
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:51,708
Are you new?

873
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:53,000
No, I've been here...

874
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:55,625
There's people on this list
I don't think should be here.

875
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:56,583
Like who?

876
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:04,291
<i>- ¿Qué te parece?</i>
- Hmm.

877
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,041
<i>Espectáculo.</i>

878
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:06,958
Yeah.

879
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:08,333
Just like <i>Frozen.</i>

880
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,833
<i>Esto es nada. Hay mucho más.</i>

881
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,166
<i>Mucho más.</i>

882
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:20,791
She's having a great time.

883
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:37,916
Dirty martini.

884
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:47,791
- You're him.
- This is what's gonna happen.

885
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:50,375
You're gonna take two steps to the left.
Look at me.

886
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:53,458
You're gonna walk out of that elevator,
I'ma be right behind you.

887
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:56,833
Please. I'm about to sell 100,000 pills.

888
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:59,375
- Let me finish this sale.
- No, we ain't got time for that.

889
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:05,541
Shit.

890
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,291
- Get down!
- Don't come closer.

891
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,458
Just do what he says.

892
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,583
Tell him put it down. Talk to him.

893
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:12,875
Just do what he says.

894
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,291
Put your guns down.

895
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:16,291
You don't,
I'll make a mess of him right now.

896
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:18,708
You can have him.
We're just gonna take the pills.

897
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:21,166
Fine, take the pills.
We can work it out.

898
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:24,208
Hey! Put the case down now!

899
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:26,333
Don't! Don't come any closer.

900
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,500
Nobody wants to die.

901
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,000
Put your guns down.

902
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:30,708
Let's talk.

903
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:31,625
All right?

904
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,166
Let's talk.

905
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:36,416
Yeah. That's good.

906
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,541
No!

907
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,958
Oh!

908
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,750
Get me out! Get me out! Get me out!

909
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:31,166
Get me out!

910
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:45,500
Get me out of here!

911
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:49,958
Help me! Please!

912
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,416
Where is she? Where's my daughter?

913
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,500
- Now let's talk.
- Yes.

914
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:56,708
Whatever you want. Pills, money, anything.

915
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:58,375
I don't want no frickin' pills.

916
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:01,208
Who is this, and where do I find them?

917
01:09:01,291 --> 01:09:02,833
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

918
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:05,125
- Just... please, no need for this...
- Huh? No?

919
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:09,833
I bet you know now, huh?

920
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:10,958
Genesis. Genesis.

921
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:12,125
What the hell is Genesis?

922
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,708
The whole operation's
on a boat called the Genesis.

923
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:16,458
Is that where my daughter is?

924
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:18,833
Is she on the boat?
Tell me where my daughter is!

925
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:21,041
- NOPD, drop your weapon!
- Oh. God!

926
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:22,625
- Help me!
- Shut up.

927
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,916
- Put the gun down, now!
- I can't do that, chief.

928
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I am not asking!

929
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,041
All right, gun down, hands up.
Boss, you running everything.

930
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,500
- Just know I got a little hitch here.
- I don't care!

931
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:36,416
I understand you don't care,
but I gotta care.

932
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,541
I'm just letting you know I'm complying,
okay?

933
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:41,708
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used...

934
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:43,083
Ah!

935
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:44,333
- Wait.
- What now?

936
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:45,333
Robin!

937
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:47,125
Robin told me to tell you something.

938
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:50,125
She said every moment
comes with invisible decisions.

939
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:52,875
She told me to tell you about mine rats
and seismographs...

940
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,833
Man it was long.
It was about decisions,

941
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:56,875
but in the end she said, "Am I lying?"

942
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:44,166
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I got worried.

943
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,666
Shit, is that Biggie?

944
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:51,500
Go, go, go! Get her out of here!

945
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,583
- You okay?
- Hell, no.

946
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:11,791
Jesus.

947
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:14,791
You're under arrest.

948
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:19,125
- Frank, we gotta help him.
- You already did help him.

949
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,166
You brought him here.
Are you not paying attention?

950
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,250
He's using you.

951
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:23,333
What, and you don't?

952
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:25,833
At least he's being honest about it.

953
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:28,083
Come on. Art, tell him what you told me.

954
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:29,041
Go home.

955
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,041
- No, come on, please, you can't give up.
- I said...

956
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,500
- go home.
- You cannot give up!

957
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,458
Do I look like your daddy or something?

958
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:40,250
It's okay, all right?

959
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:43,791
Frank!

960
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:46,375
- Down in the basement!
- You gotta help him.

961
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:48,416
He'll never find his daughter
if you arrest him.

962
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:53,875
Well, you're both a bunch of cowards!

963
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:56,583
Frank!

964
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,291
<i>You've reached the voicemail</i>
<i>of Captain Craine</i>

965
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,625
<i>of the New Orleans Police Department.
Please leave a mess...</i>

966
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,000
Captain, I got the guy.

967
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,125
I'm bringing him in. Call me back.

968
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:48,541
You're making a big mistake.

969
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:52,083
Uh-huh. Let me guess, you're one
of the good drug dealers, right?

970
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:53,791
You're trying to save the world.

971
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:56,250
They have my daughter.

972
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:57,958
That is my world.

973
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,875
Listen, it ain't too late
for you to walk away.

974
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,333
I don't know, man.

975
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:06,083
You're the one in handcuffs,
and I'm literally in the driver's seat,

976
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,333
so what am I missing?

977
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,458
What you're missing is

978
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,333
in the next 30 seconds,
your captain is gonna call you

979
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,833
and tell you to take me
to a different place, not the precinct.

980
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,291
But we're never gonna make it
to that place.

981
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,083
Oh yeah? Why is that?

982
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:24,041
Think about what you've seen.

983
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:26,583
Testing in New Orleans.

984
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:28,250
Why?

985
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:31,083
Local authorities on payroll.

986
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:32,666
Why?

987
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:35,583
And then your captain
sends out a single cop

988
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:39,333
to apprehend the most dangerous man
in the city. Why?

989
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,500
Because he's taking orders
from someone else.

990
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:07,708
And I can also tell you
that that van over there...

991
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,000
ain't delivering newspapers.

992
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:14,333
This what's gonna happen.

993
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:17,166
They gonna kill you,
and then they gonna take me.

994
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,541
Now, I'm okay
with that second part of this

995
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:21,833
if it gets me to my daughter sooner.

996
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,291
- What are they doing here?
- Doing field testing.

997
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:27,125
If they can stabilize it,
then they'll mass produce it.

998
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:31,583
So whatever's happening here
is gonna start happening everywhere.

999
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:35,041
And what?
Your kid has something to do with it?

1000
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:38,083
Where do you think
they got the formula from?

1001
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,125
What do you need?

1002
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,500
This ain't your fight.

1003
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:51,583
It's my city.

1004
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:55,458
They think they can just test their shit
on the people of New Orleans

1005
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:57,708
and no one's gonna care,
no one's gonna fight them on it?

1006
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:00,250
Well, let 'em see what happens.
What do you need?

1007
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,541
You still got them pills on you?

1008
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,541
<i>What happened to the cop?</i>

1009
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,916
<i>Get the Major to A deck.</i>

1010
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,083
<i>I want all personnel and cargo loaded
ASAP.</i>

1011
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,458
<i>The Genesis leaves tonight.</i>

1012
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:59,083
What the hell are you doing here?
I told you...

1013
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:01,541
You scared me half to death,
almost gave me a heart attack!

1014
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,708
- Those men have guns...
- Don't be barking orders at me...

1015
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:06,250
- You not my daddy...
- We're not having this conversation.

1016
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:07,166
Come here.

1017
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:11,083
- They got Art.
- Yeah, I know.

1018
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,666
So you let 'em take him?

1019
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:17,166
No, it was his plan. It's the only way
he can get to his daughter.

1020
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,958
- Now I gotta bust in after him.
- So what are we gonna do about it?

1021
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:24,000
All right, you wanna help?

1022
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:25,958
You stay here.

1023
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:29,500
Put this in your ear and you tell me
about what's coming and what's going.

1024
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:30,583
Take it.

1025
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:32,041
You're the lookout.

1026
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,833
It's an important role.

1027
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,791
Testing, testing, testing.

1028
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:42,833
I hear you.

1029
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:45,041
You got a few guards with guns
right in front of you.

1030
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,500
Yeah, thanks.

1031
01:16:47,166 --> 01:16:49,041
I think you should do
the Clint Eastwood thing.

1032
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:52,500
I'm not doing the Clint Eastwood thing.

1033
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:55,541
- How's it going?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1034
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,625
- I got a meeting upstairs.
- Stay right there.

1035
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:58,541
Okay.

1036
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:01,333
You know who I am, right?
NOLA dock authority.

1037
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:02,958
You know I don't care, right?

1038
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:05,166
You heard of a harbor master?
That's my boss.

1039
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:08,583
Now, if your boss doesn't give my boss
ten thousand dollars,

1040
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:10,500
<i>this vessel's not going anywhere.</i>

1041
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:14,208
<i>- I guess that vessel's not going anywhere.</i>
- He's not down, Frank.

1042
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:16,708
<i>I think maybe you gotta go
with the Clint Eastwood thing.</i>

1043
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:17,916
Do it.

1044
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:20,708
<i>Come on, like you practiced in the mirror.</i>

1045
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:26,500
Well, I guess you just gotta ask yourself
one question.

1046
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:30,208
<i>Am I gonna be the guy
that makes a bad decision</i>

1047
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:32,708
to send the bag man home empty-handed,

1048
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:34,375
make the boss get out of bed,

1049
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:37,083
start raining hellfire
on whoever's responsible?

1050
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:41,250
Or am I gonna be the guy
who makes a good decision

1051
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:43,833
and get the hell out of the goddamn way,

1052
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:46,708
so we can all get home
in time to watch the Saints highlights?

1053
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,250
<i>Yeah, Frank!</i>

1054
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:50,666
So what's it gonna be...

1055
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,291
punk?

1056
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,000
I'm the punk?

1057
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:58,958
Oh, did I stutter?

1058
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:01,416
Wait here.

1059
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,750
<i>I told you.</i>

1060
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:06,875
Pretty good, right?

1061
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:20,541
Where's Tracy?

1062
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,833
I'm just here for Tracy.

1063
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:25,625
She's safe.

1064
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:28,625
Come with me.

1065
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,291
Hey, I got an answer for you.

1066
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:38,208
Thank you very much.

1067
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:45,750
<i>Let's get him outta here.</i>

1068
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:49,083
I know you think
what we're doing here is wrong,

1069
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:51,958
but do you know the name Henrietta Lacks?

1070
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:56,458
Henrietta Lacks checks into a hospital
in 1951

1071
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:58,916
to have a tumor removed from her cervix,

1072
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,416
but the doctor
doesn't just take the tumor,

1073
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,083
he also takes healthy cells
in the process.

1074
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:05,958
<i>Frank. Wait, can you hear me?</i>

1075
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,083
<i>Frank?</i>

1076
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:09,791
Hello there.

1077
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:14,166
Those cells, stolen without her consent,

1078
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,541
are the backbone
of nearly every medical advancement

1079
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:18,666
in the last century.

1080
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:22,166
All because someone took one look
at that woman

1081
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,833
and saw her true potential.

1082
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,500
Tracy's lab results are fascinating.

1083
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:30,833
We're talking about permanent power,
the next step in human evolution.

1084
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,333
All of our greatest advancements
began in darkness, Major.

1085
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:44,375
It's up to the pioneers to light the way.

1086
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:50,750
Well, you see,
that's the thing, Doc.

1087
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,333
You not a pioneer.

1088
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:54,708
You a drug dealer.

1089
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,625
How about you take your science project

1090
01:19:57,916 --> 01:19:59,625
and you shove it up your mother...

1091
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:03,958
Grab him. Get him out.

1092
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:05,666
Take him below.

1093
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:08,916
Salvage whatever genetic material you can
and flush the rest.

1094
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:37,083
Frank.

1095
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,833
No, you're supposed to be the lookout.

1096
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:40,041
Well, you got shot.

1097
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:40,958
Yeah, I know.

1098
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:42,333
So what, you bulletproof?

1099
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:43,333
It's cool, right?

1100
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:46,458
<i>Alpha 5 to ops.</i>

1101
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,625
<i>Open hatch 26.</i>

1102
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:50,250
Shit.

1103
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,958
- Doors.
<i>- Ops, hatch 26.</i>

1104
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:56,250
The doors.

1105
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:02,333
Hatch 26...

1106
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:09,291
Nicely done.

1107
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,000
They're taking him below deck.

1108
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:12,375
Sub level two.

1109
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:23,500
Okay, so see here?

1110
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:26,083
All the checkpoints
got their own security doors.

1111
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:29,250
And if I press those two buttons,
the whole thing go on lockdown mode.

1112
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:30,500
Yeah, that's like County.

1113
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,666
So you're saying
you can open and close doors for me.

1114
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,833
I mean, I think so.

1115
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,041
- Why?
- Stay here.

1116
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:40,541
- Where you going?
- I'm going after Art.

1117
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
You get in any trouble, you run.
You meet me at the front of the ship.

1118
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,750
If I can get there, I will.
If I can't, then you keep running.

1119
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:48,625
But there's like a thousand guards
out there.

1120
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:51,500
But you know I'm awesome, right?

1121
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:53,458
Well, go be awesome then.

1122
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,416
It's about to get real noisy.

1123
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,166
Hey. Wrong way.

1124
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:03,208
I know!

1125
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:11,208
Get me Wallace.

1126
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:13,000
Is the Major secure?

1127
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,166
Got eyes on him right now.

1128
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,458
<i>Get to ops,</i>
<i>find out why this alarm is going off.</i>

1129
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:18,625
On it.

1130
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:20,750
Can you hear me, Robin?

1131
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:23,250
Hearing and... seeing.

1132
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:25,208
Hatch 18.

1133
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:34,583
<i>Merci "buckets."</i>

1134
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:35,750
I got you.

1135
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,166
All right, where am I going now?

1136
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:42,458
There's another door at the other end,
to the left, down the stairs.

1137
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,333
Alpha 1 to ops.

1138
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:45,875
Pop hatch 15.

1139
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,333
<i>Alpha 1 to ops.</i>

1140
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:50,916
<i>Hatch 15, open it up.</i>

1141
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,250
Frank, we got a problem.

1142
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:54,125
Let's go.

1143
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:02,750
- That big dude's coming this way.
<i>- Which way?</i>

1144
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:06,708
My way.

1145
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:12,583
- How quickly can you get us out of here?
- About 15 minutes until we can release

1146
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:14,083
- from the dock, ma'am.
- You got ten.

1147
01:23:15,583 --> 01:23:16,416
Let's go!

1148
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,041
- You're almost there.
<i>- Down here?</i>

1149
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:23,500
- Down the stairs, last door to the right.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1150
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,000
<i>Heading down to sub level two.</i>

1151
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:31,833
Frank, I think I found her.

1152
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,500
Can't hear you, Robin.

1153
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:35,750
<i>Frank, I know where she is.</i>

1154
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:37,833
You're breaking up.
What'd you say you found?

1155
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:38,833
- Something what?
<i>- Tracy.</i>

1156
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,083
- What you say?
<i>- You hearing me?</i>

1157
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,625
Robin, I'm losing you.

1158
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:44,041
<i>I can't hear you, Robin.</i>

1159
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:45,833
Security deck, engine deck...

1160
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:47,416
Lab deck.

1161
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:50,916
- What did you say? You found what?
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>

1162
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:56,541
<i>Frank, look out,
there's someone behind you!</i>

1163
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,500
Ah!

1164
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:11,166
Ah!

1165
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:18,916
What the...

1166
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,416
Frank, the door!

1167
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,833
<i>Just get him to the door, Frank.</i>

1168
01:24:28,916 --> 01:24:30,000
Y'all hear that?

1169
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:32,166
That's the sound

1170
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,625
of the most advanced tactical team
in the world

1171
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:35,916
taking over your ship.

1172
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,791
<i>Frank, punch him in the nuts or something.</i>

1173
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:43,166
<i>Come on, Frank. It's time to be awesome.</i>

1174
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:56,958
Get ready with the door!

1175
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:00,500
Close it!

1176
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:15,958
Fuck!

1177
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:20,208
<i>Wallace,</i>
<i>what the hell is going on down there?</i>

1178
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,208
<i>Give me an update.</i>

1179
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:23,291
Room's empty.

1180
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,583
She took the escape hatch.

1181
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:26,625
<i>She could be anywhere.</i>

1182
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:28,166
<i>You get back to the Major.</i>

1183
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,208
<i>We are ending this.</i>

1184
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,041
<i>Somebody find that kid.</i>

1185
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:32,500
We gotta move.

1186
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:33,458
You got this?

1187
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:38,500
You. With me.

1188
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:51,125
<i>The ship is ready.</i>

1189
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,041
Well, then get us out to sea.

1190
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,583
Let me ask you something, big man.

1191
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:38,500
What's the most powerful animal
on the planet?

1192
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:40,541
Shut up.

1193
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:43,583
Some people think it's the lion
'cause, you know, they big,

1194
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:44,875
but it's actually the...

1195
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:47,625
the pistol shrimp.

1196
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:50,208
Little bitty guy, look harmless,

1197
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:54,833
but hit you so fast,
it vaporizes the water around it.

1198
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:59,791
Eight thousand degrees hotter
than the surface of the sun.

1199
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,833
The shock waves,

1200
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,500
rips the flesh right off the bone.

1201
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:08,583
And when it's all over,

1202
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:14,041
it's just Mr. Shrimp
sitting there, eating...

1203
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:16,583
anything that's left.

1204
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:19,958
Yeah, so?

1205
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:21,875
So...

1206
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:25,916
We get all these powers from animals,
right?

1207
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,333
Guess what animal I got?

1208
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:47,916
You made the right choice.

1209
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:48,958
Smart man.

1210
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,250
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1211
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:53,375
Get the fuck out of here!

1212
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:57,208
Gotta be honest,

1213
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,833
I was a little disappointed
we took you without a fight.

1214
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,708
Got a lot of dead friends because of you.

1215
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:16,791
Let's go.

1216
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,666
Something funny?

1217
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:21,708
Don't move!

1218
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:31,958
Took you long enough.

1219
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,541
Yeah, you're welcome.

1220
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:35,958
That's disgusting, by the way. Come on.

1221
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:07,000
Tracy?

1222
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:12,125
I'm Robin.

1223
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,250
I gotta get you out of here.

1224
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:18,625
I'm with your dad.

1225
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,416
I gotta bring you to him.

1226
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:23,375
He's here.

1227
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:26,041
Really?

1228
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:29,500
He came?

1229
01:29:32,208 --> 01:29:33,208
I knew he'd come.

1230
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,416
All right, I'm gonna check the other room.

1231
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:49,791
No!

1232
01:29:49,875 --> 01:29:51,583
I want you on the deck now.
It's the only way

1233
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:53,625
- she can get off this damn ship.
- Yes, ma'am.

1234
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:05,250
<i>All security personnel</i>
<i>should be on full alert.</i>

1235
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:10,125
<i>The asset is missing. Multiple intruders.
I want a full sweep of the ship.</i>

1236
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:14,166
We gotta keep moving.

1237
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,916
- Was that Robin I heard?
- Yeah, she's in the control room.

1238
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,333
I think she knows where Tracy is.

1239
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:26,583
Hatch 16.

1240
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:29,541
Robin, hatch 16.

1241
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:34,458
All right, we gotta get to the bow.

1242
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,208
- Tracy?
- Robin?

1243
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:44,625
Where is she? Tracy?

1244
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,125
What's going on?

1245
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,583
I told her anything goes wrong,
meet at the front of the boat.

1246
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,333
Tracy.

1247
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:08,875
I missed you so much.

1248
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:22,125
Art.

1249
01:31:24,166 --> 01:31:25,000
We gotta go.

1250
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:28,041
You okay?

1251
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:30,250
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

1252
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:43,791
How much time we got left?

1253
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:45,458
Less than five, more than zero.

1254
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,875
- Still got your pill?
- Yeah, I'm saving that one.

1255
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:50,250
Saving it for what?

1256
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:51,750
Last resort.

1257
01:32:33,166 --> 01:32:34,041
I got this, go!

1258
01:32:44,791 --> 01:32:45,833
Ah!

1259
01:32:52,791 --> 01:32:54,125
Get her to the lifeboat!

1260
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:55,125
Come on!

1261
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:06,708
Where's Robin?

1262
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:08,416
I don't know.

1263
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,458
All right, we're gonna run. Ready?

1264
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:11,916
Stay with me. Go, go, go!

1265
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,958
Come on! Your dad's right behind us.

1266
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:26,541
Don't shoot the girl!

1267
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:34,208
It's stuck!

1268
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:41,791
- Now!
- Now!

1269
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:46,875
Yes!

1270
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,541
Meet me at the lifeboat.

1271
01:34:22,041 --> 01:34:24,166
- Where's Robin?
- Thought she was with you.

1272
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,125
Major!

1273
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:27,958
Stop, Major!

1274
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:31,000
You see who I have here?

1275
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,958
Get off of me!

1276
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,541
I want Tracy out here now!

1277
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,791
- Give me the pill.
- It's not gonna work on you.

1278
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:40,333
- It's got to be me.
- No, Daddy.

1279
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:43,458
- You know what'll happen if you do that.
- I will kill her, Arthur, right now,

1280
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:44,625
right in front of you.

1281
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,750
I love you more
than anything in the world, you hear me?

1282
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:51,125
I love you, but there's no way
we're leaving her behind.

1283
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,625
All of you out of the boat, now!

1284
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:57,916
Look, if anything goes wrong,

1285
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,916
you drop this boat down
and get out of here, okay?

1286
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
All right.

1287
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:02,666
I'm gonna end this.

1288
01:35:32,625 --> 01:35:33,541
Hold your fire.

1289
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,500
I want Tracy out here now!

1290
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:55,583
Wait.

1291
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:03,458
- Robin, you all right?
- Don't talk to her!

1292
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:05,375
Let me tell you something, Robin.

1293
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:06,666
You did a great job.

1294
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:08,208
You saved my daughter's life.

1295
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:10,625
Now you listen up, Doc!

1296
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:12,291
You got one chance.

1297
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:15,666
You let her go, I let you live.

1298
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:18,750
This isn't a negotiation.

1299
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:19,666
No.

1300
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:21,458
It's something else.

1301
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:24,875
I told you what was gonna happen,
didn't I?

1302
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:26,666
Now you tell me...

1303
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:29,708
am I lying?

1304
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:21,791
Hey.

1305
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:33,791
Hey, come on Daddy.

1306
01:38:54,916 --> 01:38:56,000
Daddy, come on!

1307
01:39:03,166 --> 01:39:04,000
Daddy!

1308
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:07,041
Daddy, come on!

1309
01:39:16,791 --> 01:39:18,416
Ah! Ah!

1310
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,500
Daddy?

1311
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,208
Yes! Yes!

1312
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,833
Thank you.

1313
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:27,875
Stand up.

1314
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:35,375
Y'all ready?

1315
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:06,250
Tracy, do you think you could heal
a gunshot wound?

1316
01:40:22,666 --> 01:40:24,791
<i>Good morning, New Orleans!</i>

1317
01:40:24,875 --> 01:40:28,750
<i>Who dat say they gon' beat dem Saints?</i>

1318
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:31,291
<i>Man, it went down in the Dome last night.</i>

1319
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:33,125
<i>It was even louder on the streets.</i>

1320
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:37,208
<i>Did y'all hear about the two explosions
last night after the game?</i>

1321
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:40,708
<i>The Coast Guard's saying
they can't find any sign of the ship,</i>

1322
01:40:40,791 --> 01:40:45,291
<i>and then, NOPD has absolutely nothing
to say about it.</i>

1323
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,166
So what's next for you?

1324
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:51,083
Well, first I think I'll have
a long talk with my captain

1325
01:40:51,416 --> 01:40:54,500
then maybe find a journalist
looking for their next big story.

1326
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:56,875
You blow that whistle,
ain't no going back.

1327
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:57,791
Yeah.

1328
01:40:57,875 --> 01:41:01,250
Well, let's see these assholes try to hide
when everyone knows what they're doing.

1329
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:06,125
Let me ask you something.

1330
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:09,375
You think this is really over?

1331
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:13,916
For me, it is.

1332
01:41:16,333 --> 01:41:17,291
It's time to jet.

1333
01:41:18,791 --> 01:41:19,625
Hey, you.

1334
01:41:20,666 --> 01:41:21,500
Go to my truck.

1335
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:24,166
Make sure you check the trunk.

1336
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:26,208
You remember what I said?

1337
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:34,250
There's something great inside you, Robin.

1338
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:37,750
Use it.

1339
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:52,791
Here.

1340
01:41:52,875 --> 01:41:54,666
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

1341
01:41:57,125 --> 01:41:57,958
Frank.

1342
01:41:58,375 --> 01:42:00,041
Why you got my mama's phone, man?

1343
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:01,125
It's a long story.

1344
01:42:01,666 --> 01:42:02,500
Seriously.

1345
01:42:02,833 --> 01:42:03,666
Frank!

1346
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:06,333
I love you, Ma.

1347
01:43:10,208 --> 01:43:11,208
I love you too.

1348
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,833
<i>Man, I am about to beat</i>
<i>on your eardrums with this one.</i>

1349
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:20,000
<i>It's the first single</i>

1350
01:43:20,083 --> 01:43:23,375
<i>from brand new MC Robin Reilly,
featuring Chika.</i>

1351
01:43:23,458 --> 01:43:24,375
<i>Let's go!</i>
