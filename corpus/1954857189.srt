1
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,967
I used to be somebody.

2
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,632
Well, let me put it this way,

3
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,832
I used to be a tabloid
television producer,

4
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,033
the dirtiest, most unethical
bastard in the business.

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,867
That means I was
one of the best.

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,767
I was somebody.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,332
But times change.

8
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,499
I got older,

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,233
new kids moved in.

10
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,767
Suddenly, an old hack
like me was unhireable.

11
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:56,367
And that's how this all started.

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,566
Stranded in that hellhole
called Los Angeles,

13
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:01,532
out of work,

14
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,066
out of options.

15
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,699
And knowing if I
was going to work,

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,667
I'd have to write my own ticket.

17
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,667
So, I decided to create
my own television series.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,800
A travel show for stoners.

19
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:16,832
I'd find marijuana makers
all over the world,

20
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,266
smoke dope and
drink beer all day,

21
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:20,933
and get paid for it.

22
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,167
Huh, fucking genius
if you ask me.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,599
All I needed was a cameraman.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,100
And that's when my old
buddy Roland came in.

25
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:30,633
What's the hook?

26
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,300
He could use a gig, too.

27
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:34,832
Only problem?

28
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,132
He doesn't drink, smoke,

29
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,067
or do any drugs at all.

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,800
I can tolerate that.

31
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,132
Paying him was out
of the question.

32
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,499
So, I plied his
imagination with images

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,432
of exotic locations,
gorgeous beaches,

34
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:49,667
beautiful women.

35
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,466
Take Two.

36
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:57,067
Exotic locations, nude
beaches, naked women,

37
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,767
all on his air miles.

38
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,500
It wasn't long before Roland
was dusting off his gas mask.

39
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,066
It was simple as that.

40
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:10,800
A brainchild born of pot,
booze, and desperation.

41
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,499
And you know what?

42
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,333
It may have been better
if it was never conceived.

43
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:19,900
Because then, all this
never would have happened.

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,933
I'm Dave High, and
this is my story.

45
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,832
* Pack up your troubles

46
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,433
* Come on along

47
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,966
* When I start dreaming

48
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,667
* And life's a song

49
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,799
* In Honolulu across the sea

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,900
* Making wiki waki
down in Waikiki

51
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,366
* Those hula dancers
are sure good news

52
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:02,400
* Those joy dispensers
are cure for the blues

53
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:05,532
* It's absolutely
the place to be

54
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,667
* Making wiki waki
down in Waikiki

55
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,599
* No evening calls

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,099
* Anything goes

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,667
* Believe it or not

58
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,767
* And when the
night shadows fall

59
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:19,633
* That's when they're
all getting hot

60
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,699
* On the ukulele

61
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,700
* They use the movies
to light the night

62
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,800
* And every tune seems
to sound just right

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,266
* It's absolutely
the place to be

64
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:34,600
* Making wiki waki
down in Waikiki *

65
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,366
We were
somewhere over the Pacific

66
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,499
on the edge of 40,000 feet

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,067
when reality began to take hold.

68
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,499
The pre-flight joint
was wearing off

69
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,567
and I had a mother
of a hangover.

70
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,833
Roland's words
echoed in my brain.

71
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,067
What's the hook?

72
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,067
And that's when it dawned on me.

73
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,199
That's a pretty good question.

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
Who needs a hook?

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,699
Oh, shit.

76
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,567
I'm having a panic attack.

77
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:10,067
I try fighting it off
with a couple a beers.

78
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,167
Fuck a joint, I'd kill
for a fucking cigarette.

79
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:15,166
It is what?

80
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,132
Buffalo pork sandwich.

81
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,099
It's our upgraded meal.

82
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,267
It's $14.00.

83
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,733
Ah.

84
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:25,332
We're flying to Hawaii
to shoot a TV series,

85
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,800
and I don't have a fucking
clue what I'm doing.

86
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,167
I don't even have
anything set up.

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,266
This is what happens
when you believe

88
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:33,700
your own bullshit.

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,799
All right, settle down.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,066
Take two.

91
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,799
We're flying to Hawaii,

92
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,832
to some remote place
on the Big Island

93
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,066
that's suppose to have the best

94
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,133
and cheapest pot on Earth,

95
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,067
and a nude beach.

96
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,667
Ah, that's better.

97
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:53,300
Oh yeah, Rosanne Barr
happens to live there, too.

98
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,699
I told Roland I know her.

99
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,199
I'd interviewed her once,

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,632
and I'm pretty
sure that I can get

101
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,433
the old pothead to fire
one up with me on camera.

102
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,700
I lied.

103
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:06,200
Panic, panic, this
is an emergency.

104
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,366
I immediately administer
20 milligrams of Valium

105
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,133
and another beer
to induce a coma.

106
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,466
Ladies and Gentlemen,

107
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,500
we will be landing shortly.

108
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:29,800
Five hours later, I awaken
in a place called heaven.

109
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,432
How come nobody told me it rains

110
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,932
every fucking day of the year

111
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:44,500
on this side of the island?

112
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:50,567
Pissing down rain all the
way from Hilo to Pahoa.

113
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,200
Pahoa, the pot
capital of Hawaii.

114
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,133
The Promise Land.

115
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:02,133
We traveled 2500
freaking miles for this?

116
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,066
Hmm, looks more like

117
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:08,932
an old Wild West town
than an island village.

118
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,499
And I don't know
whether to pull out

119
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,267
a one hitter or a six shooter.

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,500
It's sundown by the time
we arrive at our lodgings.

121
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:24,600
I wangled an invite from
the mother of an old friend.

122
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,733
Guess I forgot how old.

123
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:33,967
Oh, Jesus, we've checked
into the fucking Bates Motel.

124
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,567
Oh man, I've got to think fast.

125
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:43,467
I offer to pay for a
hotel room, for me.

126
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,732
Roland can have this
place to himself.

127
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,899
Him and Mrs. Bates,
five cats, two dogs,

128
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,133
a nest of cockroaches, and
a plague of coqui frogs.

129
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:57,832
Meanwhile, David has

130
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,500
a luxury suite in
downtown Pahoa.

131
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,433
Dolphins, nice
big king bed, I like this.

132
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,700
This is a new favorite.

133
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:12,966
Here it is.

134
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,099
Now, the next order of business,

135
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,267
stock the fridge and
procure some pot.

136
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,299
I don't walk 100 yards
before I score a cheap eighth

137
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,533
off a street dealer who
calls himself Surfer Dave.

138
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,099
And I hit the first bar I
find to have a few beers,

139
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,600
and wait and see if
this shit's any good.

140
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,366
We've either ended
up in Alabama,

141
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,500
or that asshole, Surfer
Dave, spiked the pot.

142
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,767
I set out to find the bastard,

143
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,967
to get some more.

144
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,467
Who's there?

145
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,067
Five-0.

146
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,667
That's not fucking funny, man.

147
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:19,833
Fucking $300.00 eighth.

148
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,300
What happened?

149
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Oh man, I don't
know, I got ripped off.

150
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,300
How? What?

151
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,767
I was just a fucking idiot.

152
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,433
I hate to admit it, I
don't even want this in it.

153
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,166
Oh, it's got to be in it.

154
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,599
Yeah, yeah, I supposed
to know what I'm doing.

155
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,632
Dave High got ripped off? No.

156
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:44,199
Until I come to fucking
cow town Hawaii and I get,

157
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,599
I'm ripped off by a skel,
and it's a bit embarrassing.

158
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,099
I'm from LA, I
should know better.

159
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,432
Look, my hands are fucking
shaking, look, I'm still, ugh.

160
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,832
I could have been killed
for Christ's sake.

161
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,499
My body could be chopped up
and lying out in that jungle.

162
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,533
I need to smoke a joint
to tell you this, man.

163
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:08,232
I got to calm down, I'm
a bit shaken by this.

164
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:09,633
I feel like a fucking moron.

165
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,933
I'm feeling better already.

166
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,833
Oh yeah, I'm back to normal.

167
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,566
And finally I tell him how
Surfer Dave took me for a ride.

168
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:41,567
So, sure enough, I walk out
and there he is, Surfer Dave,

169
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,399
and I said, "That's
really good shit, man,

170
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,000
"you know, I'd like
another ounce of it."

171
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,399
But the catch is he
doesn't have it with him.

172
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,666
We're going to have to go out to

173
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,899
where he's got the pot,
some fucking house,

174
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,533
and it's supposed to
be about five miles.

175
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,767
Driving, driving, driving.

176
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,432
So, we most have gone
about 20 freaking miles.

177
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,766
I've no idea where it is.

178
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,732
And he says, "Well,
pull over here"

179
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,766
in pitch black, pitch dark.

180
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,933
And he says, "Okay, give me
the money, I'll be right back."

181
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,433
I had to step back.

182
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,599
Roland doesn't have the
best of nights, either,

183
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,300
at the Bates Motel.

184
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,132
You should have been here

185
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,332
about a month ago.

186
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,732
The whole house
smelled so beautiful.

187
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,466
That must have been awesome.

188
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,067
Oh, yeah.

189
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,999
Test for sound in driving rain

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,700
at 2:00 in the morning.

191
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:58,967
Between the frogs, the
cats, the odd screams,

192
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,367
and this heavy downpour, I
just can't get any sleep.

193
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,500
And Mr. T, the
tomcat, pissed on his tripod.

194
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,099
Mr. T--

195
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,567
This one,
yeah, you got to watch him.

196
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:17,600
We both need to get
out of Dutch for the day.

197
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,499
I want to score some more pot,

198
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,267
and find that nude beach.

199
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:26,200
But Roland's all fired up
about finding Roseanne.

200
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,967
So, we leave a few calling cards
around town and head north,

201
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,632
in search of sunshine,

202
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:38,133
and Hawaii's most famous
grower of macadamia nuts.

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,267
And God knows what else.

204
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:48,399
The Queen Liliulakalani
Kamuela Museum,

205
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,566
Roseanne bought the place
around the same time

206
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:53,700
she bought the macadamia
nut farm down the road.

207
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,600
Strange, we're the only
ones waiting to get in.

208
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,232
What kind of fucking
museum is this?

209
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,667
Hmm, gate's not locked.

210
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,266
Hello!

211
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:11,200
A woman in a white
bathrobe answers the door.

212
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,467
So, is the museum open?

213
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,800
The gate was not locked.

214
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:22,067
Holy fuck, it's her!

215
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,633
Are you Roseanne?

216
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,567
I didn't expect to see you here.

217
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,732
Oh, I'm sure.

218
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:28,699
She doesn't quite know
what the fuck's going on.

219
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,066
She's disturbed I got in,

220
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,467
and she thinks some
stalker's broken in.

221
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,067
Oh, I'm sorry.

222
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,666
No, it wasn't, didn't have a
lock, I just went straight in.

223
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,100
Now she's pissed.

224
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:42,700
So, we couldn't come back
at another point and see it?

225
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,367
No, okay, thanks!

226
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,666
So, it was getting to the point

227
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,332
where I knew that
I better just say,

228
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,666
"Sorry for bothering
you," and leave nicely,

229
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:56,667
or, you know, the shit
was going to hit the fan.

230
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,967
Oh, I'm so sorry to bother
you, okay, thank you.

231
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,867
That door just
slammed in my face.

232
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,167
I got to get the fuck out of
here before the cops arrive.

233
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,299
Whatever just happened,
what a fuck up.

234
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,599
If I thought quick,

235
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,666
I would have done the
whole thing differently.

236
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,067
But I don't think
that quick anymore.

237
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,699
Everyone says she's
living at the nut farm.

238
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,633
I guess you've got to wonder
why she's living in a museum.

239
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,333
If that wasn't enough, now
I have to deal with Roland.

240
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,700
I thought you knew her.

241
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,867
Well, you know, a long time ago.

242
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,332
Why didn't you remind her?

243
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,566
I figure if she
doesn't recognize me,

244
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,799
then how the fuck is she
going to remember me.

245
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,532
She's getting on, she's
probably got Alzheimer's.

246
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,499
Roland's like dripping
fucking water.

247
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,099
You got to call the publicist?

248
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,167
Yeah, of course I am, man.

249
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,600
All the way back to Pahoa.

250
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,533
The next day, Roland wakes
me up with more bad news.

251
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:14,466
Bet you drink that,

252
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:17,166
you know, instead of coffee.

253
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,266
He's had another
rough night at the Bates.

254
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,232
You know, I'm sick of you guys.

255
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:24,900
I've had 23
hours straight, no sleep.

256
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:29,067
And once again, damn cat
squirted on my tripod.

257
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,867
But the real bad
news is today's top story.

258
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,299
It's all over the local news.

259
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,266
The DEA's been
conducting drug stings

260
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,367
all over the Big Island.

261
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,232
And wouldn't you know it?

262
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:46,267
The operation began the
day we arrived in town.

263
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,867
What does that mean? Aloha!

264
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,899
Well, that just might explain

265
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,966
the welcome at the local pub.

266
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,667
Against the DEA?

267
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:57,899
Yeah, I know you, right?

268
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,466
I met you last night.

269
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,667
Everybody thinks we're narcs.

270
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,432
Look!

271
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,353
What was that, FBI taking
pictures of somebody?

272
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,132
How you doing? Aloha!

273
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,066
Aloha.

274
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:09,866
Where you from?

275
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,300
None of your business.

276
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,967
Huh, can't really blame him.

277
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,166
We're driving around
shooting cameras

278
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:19,733
out of a white Chevy that
screams undercover cop.

279
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,233
I'm never going to score pot
in this fucking town again.

280
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,700
And that's not the worst of it.

281
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,233
Now we got the
fucking chainsaw going.

282
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,767
Just shoot him
outside the window.

283
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:36,599
No, the worst of it is
three days on the Big Island

284
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,700
and we're under surveillance.

285
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,932
Those DEA fuckers
are watching me,

286
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,233
and I suspect a
connection to Surfer Dave.

287
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,866
Dave's got his watchdogs out,

288
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:51,066
telling him when it's
safe to come back to town,

289
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:54,232
cuz he thought I'd be gone
and he'd be able to come back.

290
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,766
He didn't count on us staying.

291
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,733
So now, you know, he's
holed up out in the jungle.

292
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,499
You keep
looking outside the window.

293
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,067
What's going on?

294
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:08,567
You know, man,
I feel like I'm in

295
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,066
a fucking Witness Protection
Program or something.

296
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:16,067
I'm looking out here and seeing
dudes spying on me out here.

297
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,400
I barely got enough weed
left to role a joint.

298
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
So, we're just going to have
to get out of Pahoa again

299
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,900
to find more pot
and that nude beach.

300
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,332
About 15 minutes
and 10 miles later,

301
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,499
we're in another
world of mighty waves

302
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,800
and towering palm trees,

303
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,899
scouring the virgin coastline

304
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,733
for people with
pot and no clothes.

305
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:50,233
Then, bingo, we hit the
daily double, the nude beach,

306
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,299
and about a dozen
dealers selling all kinds

307
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,733
of good stuff out of their cars.

308
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,967
Who's this guy parked
in a black pickup truck?

309
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,299
And he's wife's
sitting there with him

310
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,932
and they've got their kid,

311
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,833
but they shoo her
out of the car.

312
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,466
What really caught my
fancy was the hashish.

313
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:19,866
But I'd become a
discerning shopper.

314
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:23,599
Since Surfer Dave, I've
grown a bit more cautious.

315
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,799
So, I betted low
first to make sure

316
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,867
I wasn't buying
hardened dog shit.

317
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,066
I buy a piece and
offer the first puff

318
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:35,066
to some guy I get chatting with.

319
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,932
I used him as my
human guinea pig

320
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,366
and tried the hash on him.

321
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:43,332
I wait a few minutes
to see if it kills him

322
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,433
before I smoke it, man.

323
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,066
It actually turned out
to be quite good hash.

324
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,266
That was good, I enjoy it.

325
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:54,199
It's nice,
it's gentle, isn't it?

326
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,632
Hmm, seems safe.

327
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:57,099
Oh now, you can pakalolo.

328
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,567
This saves the marijuana.

329
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,800
His name's Tony,
he's a native Hawaiian healer.

330
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,967
I do the ancient
Hawaiian lomilomi.

331
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,366
Interesting.

332
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:13,067
And it's a type of
massage that is done.

333
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:14,800
Fascinating.

334
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:17,366
But it goes a little bit further

335
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:21,232
than just your regular massage.

336
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,799
I got a feeling he wants to do

337
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,267
that lomilomi on my dicky wicky.

338
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,432
But not now.

339
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:29,967
First give me the rub
on that nude beach.

340
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,132
Everyone here
knows that, you know,

341
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,666
you can go down
there and get naked.

342
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,099
Everyone here knows that you can

343
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,899
go down there and not get naked,

344
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,067
and nobody will
say or do anything.

345
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,233
Hey, hey, hey!

346
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,899
No one thinks anything sexual.

347
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,432
Everybody looks out of his heart

348
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:48,432
and beauty at
something beautiful.

349
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,932
You know, like a woman's
body dancing is beautiful,

350
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:53,066
and a man's body
dancing totally naked.

351
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,799
It's a beautiful thing.

352
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,132
I think Tony's
trying to get me nude.

353
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,166
I like the hair thing
and the hippie,

354
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,632
and the beard and the
whole thing going on.

355
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,066
You got the whole thing going!

356
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,332
Oh yeah, this
bastard's hitting on me.

357
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,732
Oh, just marry me, already,

358
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,332
just get over your stuff.

359
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,632
Well, same sex
marriage is legal in this state,

360
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,266
and I can't afford
to piss him off.

361
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,166
A girl doesn't
like to be rushed.

362
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,633
Give me time to think about
that marriage proposal.

363
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,632
I'll play blushing bride

364
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,799
as long as he escorts
us to the nude beach,

365
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,066
and gets the okay for us
to shoot the naked people.

366
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:29,167
I don't know, he could make
me a very good husband!

367
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,166
It looks like it's way back.

368
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,867
It was like I was
in a time warp.

369
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,066
That wedding's on hold.

370
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,667
Looks like we stumbled
upon the lost tribe.

371
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:57,932
You want to take pictures?

372
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,399
They don't mind if
you take pictures,

373
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,799
but try not to get anybody

374
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,866
that doesn't have any clothes on

375
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,500
out of respect, out of respect.

376
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:06,666
Unless they say it's all right?

377
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:07,832
Right, right, right.

378
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,432
Cuz I'd like to
put that element in,

379
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11,599
but I'm going to
say give permission.

380
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
Yeah.

381
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,399
We're not going
to need permission,

382
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,333
and I don't want it.

383
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,132
That wasn't that
many nude people.

384
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:22,000
I probably saw more nude
men's asses than I did tits.

385
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,966
Most of these hippies
are as old as I am,

386
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,799
and they're not even
as pretty as me.

387
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,266
How am I going to sell this
fucking shit to pay cable?

388
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,066
Aloha.

389
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,500
Aloha!

390
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,799
I offer her 50 bucks
to take her clothes off,

391
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,767
which she declines.

392
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,899
I decide to change my approach

393
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,333
and lower the bar a little.

394
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:50,600
What the hell, she's got
a nice rack and no taste.

395
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,099
I have a friend

396
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,799
and he looks exactly like you.

397
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,532
A friend who looks like who?

398
00:20:58,533 --> 00:20:59,532
You!

399
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,766
There's another me?

400
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,466
And she's got a
friend for Roland.

401
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:05,266
I say it's wonderful, mahalo.

402
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,132
Jaime.

403
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,299
Hi Jaime.

404
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,800
Isn't she beautiful.

405
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,066
Aloha.

406
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,500
You're welcome.

407
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,932
I prime America's next top
nude model with pot and beer,

408
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:20,466
but I still can't get her
to take her clothes off.

409
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:23,133
She'll never work on
this island again.

410
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,967
It's like someone spiked
my life with acid.

411
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,600
This seems to be going around.

412
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,433
So, look at this, the
way that package is.

413
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,267
What's going around?

414
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,433
Uh, the shits.

415
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,699
Ripped off by Surfer Dave,
Roseanne a fucking disaster,

416
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,832
somebody watching
our every move,

417
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,600
the nude beach a bust,

418
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,299
and now my guts are under attack

419
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,567
by some tropical parasite.

420
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,166
I'm in a race against time,

421
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,767
with a bottle of Kaopecktate.

422
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,667
Can you get this fucking
thing off, this is ridiculous.

423
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:08,633
It's designed that
way, it's for your protection.

424
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:12,299
Yeah great, well, I'm
trying to get this into me,

425
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,299
and I can't get the
fucking top off it.

426
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,133
What are you
going to get into you?

427
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:19,067
I get this into me.

428
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:21,567
Okay, where's the fucking top?

429
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,532
A measure--

430
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:23,966
Proper dosage.

431
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,199
I've got it, and
I've just been so sick.

432
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,299
That looks like shit!

433
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,366
I'm so sick.

434
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,366
That's disgusting.

435
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:29,600
No.

436
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,632
You're going
to do it in one shot.

437
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,333
Here's looking at you, kid.

438
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,132
What did that taste like?

439
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,767
Like sort of chocolatey flavor.

440
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:45,566
It's the only way I can survive.

441
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,667
I'm so sick, I'm a dying man.

442
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
That tells the story!

443
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,900
Kaopecktate
and plenty of liquids.

444
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,633
Oh, shit.

445
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,333
Is that just one day?

446
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,100
Roland's getting
impatient with me,

447
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:18,200
and he's fed up with
the Bates Motel.

448
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:22,499
It's now Sunday morning,
approximately 3:00 a.m.,

449
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,067
and here's the driving
rain once again.

450
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:29,100
Almost like clockwork, you
just can't get any sleep.

451
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,066
Same time every night.

452
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,433
Mrs. Bates gets up
to feed the pets.

453
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,499
So, for entertainment,

454
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,100
we watch the cats chase
and kill cockroaches.

455
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:42,599
Roland gets the leftovers.

456
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,532
Oh yeah,
they kill those roaches.

457
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:48,067
I think there's one
half dead in my bedroom.

458
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,300
Or else.

459
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:52,599
Don't argue with your mom.

460
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,333
Don't give her talk back.

461
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,800
And then, you know,
I get so upset.

462
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,599
Roland's become Norman Bates,

463
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,099
handyman, wheelchair
pusher, chauffeur,

464
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,833
and some other jobs
we won't talk about.

465
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:13,067
And I thought
maybe we cut some of the,

466
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:21,767
oh, what do you call
it, the one plant,

467
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,966
and put it in the pot.

468
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:25,232
You like action, don't you?

469
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,166
Oh, I like lots of action.

470
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,299
Yeah, I love you, baby,

471
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,867
- you're so cute!
- - Oh, wow.

472
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:33,932
I know if I don't get Roland

473
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:35,366
out of the Bates pretty fast,

474
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:38,067
he's going to pack
up and go back to LA.

475
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:43,200
To appease him, I sent an
email to Roseanne's publicist.

476
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,899
And I head up with my fiance,

477
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,499
I mean Tony, to meet Kimo,

478
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,232
a guy who rents out a
guesthouse on the ocean,

479
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:53,599
a place maybe Roland
and I can share.

480
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,832
And is this going
to be available?

481
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,099
Yeah.

482
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,932
I'm energetic and I
want to go three miles,

483
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,766
I can take my binoculars
down to the nude beach.

484
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,766
It sure is a good location,

485
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,832
only 100 yards from
Uncle Robert's,

486
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,599
a kind of hippie
community center

487
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,632
with an outdoor
market, general store,

488
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:13,066
and a tiki bar frequented by

489
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:15,166
some of the best pot
farmers on the island.

490
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:18,066
It runs west and there's
no assholes around.

491
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,499
It's fabulous.

492
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,066
Even better, they start
serving rum here at 9:00 a.m.

493
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,332
And at closing time

494
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,867
it's just crawling
distance to the guesthouse.

495
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,533
Only one little drawback.

496
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,700
It's at the base of a volcano.

497
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,099
Not long ago the
volcano erupted,

498
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,232
spewing rivers of red hot lava

499
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:45,532
that swallowed houses.
Villages, beaches,

500
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:48,400
and God knows how
many marijuana plants.

501
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:51,499
And that lava came
up within 20 feet

502
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,599
of devouring our future home.

503
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,766
Right here was the beach.

504
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:55,932
Was that lava flow?

505
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:58,066
That was the lava flow, 1990.

506
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,266
Did you stand
here and watch this?

507
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,432
Yup.

508
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,099
Only watched molten lava.

509
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,666
We watched the
lava just coming in.

510
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:04,799
For how long?

511
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,599
For two weeks.

512
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,767
Jesus!

513
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,732
As I'm talking to Kimo,

514
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:15,167
that fucking parasite
starts biting at my asshole.

515
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,667
But it turns out Kimo
has a nice native remedy.

516
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:19,866
I mean, what is that?

517
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:20,833
That's a noni.

518
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,433
So, what does it do?

519
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,632
What the noni does,

520
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,599
it cleans and takes
all the rubbish

521
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,332
from lining of your stomach.

522
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,766
Can I drink beer?

523
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:29,899
You can drink beer, you
can drink anything you want.

524
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,099
Really?

525
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,966
Hmm, now this sounds
like good medicine.

526
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,399
What do you think about
reefer, is that wikoni?

527
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,567
Noni.

528
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,199
Oh, sorry about that, man.

529
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,632
To me, reefer is good,
and the noni is good.

530
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,832
They kind of go together.

531
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,666
Seems like he
might be a cool landlord.

532
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,166
Smoke the reefer
and pick the noni.

533
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,699
If I rent this joint,

534
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,366
you going to get me
whacked on noni juice?

535
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,466
Oh, yeah!

536
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,932
Then, a little reefer?

537
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,332
Yeah, reefer and noni juice?

538
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,566
Oh, yeah!

539
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:57,532
The noni's extra though, right?

540
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,833
The noni's extra.

541
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,699
If we're going to settle in,

542
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,367
we may as well go native.

543
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:07,966
You like that?

544
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,066
Yeah.

545
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:10,300
- Hmm?
- It's you.

546
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,133
You know, they got change rooms.

547
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,633
Where's the fucking sleeve?

548
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,500
Fuckers, mother fucker.

549
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,067
It's you, man, that is cool.

550
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:38,467
What do you think?

551
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,167
Buy it, it's you.

552
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,166
What do you call this shit here?

553
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,532
Pakalolo.

554
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:45,599
Pakalolo.

555
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,267
I can never get that name right.

556
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,600
Pakalolo?

557
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:52,666
Is it pakalolo?

558
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:53,432
Yeah.

559
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,100
Pakalolo.

560
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:58,066
Pakalolo, by George,
I think I've got it!

561
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,167
And if you want more than one?

562
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:04,532
I guess it's Pakaloli,
right, is that plural?

563
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:07,366
If pakalolo would be pakaloli?

564
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:09,533
I don't know, I don't think so.

565
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,067
I don't speak Hawaiian.

566
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,666
* Good tea is my weakness

567
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:17,233
* I know it's bad

568
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:22,333
* It sends me gate and I
can't wait I'm viper mad *

569
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,199
Now speaking of pakalolo,

570
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,066
I've heard it grows
wild all around here,

571
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:34,066
and I've been combing
the tropical jungles

572
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:35,633
looking for more.

573
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:38,599
I got to keep reminding myself,

574
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm supposed to be filming
a television series here.

575
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,599
Especially on this
side of the island

576
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
because of the volcanic soil.

577
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,200
Wouldn't it be funny
if we actually found it?

578
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,666
If we actually found
a pot plant here

579
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,866
it's sure to make
me back that money,

580
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:56,167
you know, Surfer Dave
ripped off from me.

581
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,066
What are my chances of
walking through there

582
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:00,699
and finding a nice pot plant?

583
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,267
Zero to nothing.

584
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:06,132
Seems the locals have
a monopololo on the pakalolo,

585
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,766
and they're not about
to give up the farm.

586
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,066
They're a great crash crop,

587
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,532
It's a very big cash crop here.

588
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:11,832
Majority of all the people

589
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,766
who do grow marijuana,
or pakalolo,

590
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,399
it's their livelihood,
that's how they make money,

591
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,532
that's how they feed their kids

592
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:20,200
and support their family.

593
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,532
Pot's the backbone
of the local economy,

594
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,532
and although it's
not exactly legal,

595
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,832
the cops look the other way.

596
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,066
I got to rank this

597
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:33,166
as the most 420 friendly
place for a user,

598
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:35,766
not a distributor, but
for a smoker of pot,

599
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:39,399
that I've seen in a
country, maybe in the world.

600
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,132
It's a mellow place.

601
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,966
You're not bothering anyone,

602
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,266
no one's going to bother you.

603
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:45,666
I meet this guy over a joint

604
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,600
and a Mai Tai at Uncle Robert's.

605
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,300
At first, I'm sure
he thinks I'm a narc.

606
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,767
I suspect he might be one, too.

607
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:54,232
This is my job.

608
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:55,399
You're freaking cool.

609
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,232
This is my job, okay?

610
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,466
Cool.

611
00:29:58,467 --> 00:29:59,866
Cuz cops don't hug.

612
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,599
He wants to keep
his identity a secret.

613
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,199
The reason will become
clear soon enough.

614
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,667
So, for now, let's just
call him Deep Shit.

615
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,199
And let's just say he's got
vast personal experience

616
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,966
with the local pot industry

617
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,932
and the Big Island drugs laws.

618
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:18,699
What happens if I get
busted with an ounce?

619
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,032
You know, if
you get busted with an ounce,

620
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:22,499
more than likely the
judge is going to say,

621
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,766
"Do you have $100.00
to pay this fine?

622
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:27,166
"Pay your fine, and get
out of my courtroom.

623
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,367
"Next case."

624
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,732
Hawaii's a medicinal state.

625
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:35,666
Marijuana's only legal
for medicinal use.

626
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,132
But even without a card,

627
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:40,632
you're not likely to get
hassled by the local cops.

628
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:42,532
What's the
big deal smoking a joint?

629
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,466
No one's going to really
pull you into jail

630
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,832
for smoking a joint.

631
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,332
Nobody is going to bother you

632
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:53,932
for being in your place
or communing with nature,

633
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,832
and smoking a little pot.

634
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,066
The feds though,
that's a different story.

635
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,332
They don't want you

636
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,866
until you're starting
to mess with money.

637
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:02,066
Between the lines

638
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:03,800
there's a drug war
being waged here.

639
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:06,399
Ask Roger Christie.

640
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,666
He's one of the most prominent
cannabis activists in Hawaii.

641
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,832
And he brought the
battle to the Big Island

642
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,166
when he started
the THC Ministry,

643
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:17,366
a church that regarded
marijuana as a sacred herb,

644
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,666
and served it up
during services.

645
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:22,766
In 2010, the DEA busted him

646
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:26,232
on marijuana possession
and trafficking charges.

647
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:27,466
And as I stand here,

648
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:29,299
the poor bastard's
still locked up

649
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,199
in a nasty little
Guantanamo in Honolulu,

650
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,599
awaiting a trial that
never seems to come.

651
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,066
It's like Stalin's Russia

652
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:40,066
to be held without bail,
without official charges.

653
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:42,400
Maybe this place
isn't heaven after all.

654
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,866
Roland wants me to get an
interview with the local cops,

655
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:59,300
thinks it will give our
travel show more credibility.

656
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:04,333
Hawaii Police Department, can
you get that through there?

657
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,966
Here you go, better
put this in here.

658
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,432
Why, what's the deal?

659
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:13,366
Well, there's a
little bit of pot in there,

660
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,266
my daily supply.

661
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:15,466
Wait a minute,

662
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,133
you had that at a
police department?

663
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,667
We'll say no.

664
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:21,100
Fuck credibility,
cops are a buzzkill.

665
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,900
But I go through the motions.

666
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,200
Thank you very
much for your help.

667
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,667
I tell Roland the sarg has
to run it by the chief.

668
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,299
I lied.

669
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,067
I only asked the desk clerk
for directions to the volcano.

670
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:48,300
Hello?

671
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,532
And I texted Tony to
call me in 15 minutes.

672
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,633
Oh, hi Sarg, how are you?

673
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,467
Oh, cool.

674
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,633
Uh huh.

675
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,333
Oh, okay.

676
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,333
Oh okay, so really.

677
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,499
No, that's fine, but thank you,

678
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,499
I appreciate you taking the time

679
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,832
and I'm sorry to trouble you

680
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,500
but thank you very much.

681
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:19,100
Okay, I appreciate
it, take care now.

682
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,399
Oh fuck!

683
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,667
What was that?

684
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,066
That was the sarg.

685
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,100
And?

686
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,967
No ride along,

687
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,632
can't do an interview
with an officer,

688
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:35,266
and if we want any
crime statistics,

689
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:38,833
we can basically get
them off public records.

690
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,266
You know, or they
can get them to us.

691
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:43,866
So, in other words, they're
not going on camera.

692
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:45,067
I wonder why.

693
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,333
Don't know.

694
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:51,733
He sounded a little
bit hostile, actually.

695
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,266
He didn't sound real friendly,

696
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,066
"Hey brother," you know,

697
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,333
so I don't know what
the fuck's going on.

698
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,832
Oh, now the cops hate me
and they got my name--

699
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,566
As long as it's another
payoff, that's all it is.

700
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,400
I don't know what
the fuck it is.

701
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,833
I don't know what they
found on my background file.

702
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:16,132
No trap for
David High, too high?

703
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,332
Yeah, this is too high.

704
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:20,166
I think Roland buys
it, stupid bastard.

705
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,367
Coming back to the nude beach.

706
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,767
No worries at all
at the nude beach.

707
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:28,299
Bala the coconut
boy's hard at work,

708
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,699
and Tony's
entertaining the crowd.

709
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,300
What do you call a
lesbian from Alaska?

710
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,200
Klondyke.

711
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,666
And now I've got a new plan

712
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,233
for getting footage of
all these nude people.

713
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,866
There's a lot of them out today,

714
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:46,100
and some of them are pretty hot.

715
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,232
This time me and Roland
are going to make

716
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:51,067
like a pair of gay tourists.

717
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,366
He'll pretend to take
romantic home video

718
00:34:57,367 --> 00:34:58,932
of me at the seaside,

719
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,633
while he's really getting
shots of the naked ladies.

720
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:07,933
I guess 40 years of tabloid
taught me something worthwhile.

721
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,332
Hi!

722
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,599
I'm a fucking genius.

723
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,732
Ah, good to see you again.

724
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,233
Good to see you.

725
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:17,232
It's the beauty who
turned down 50 bucks

726
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:19,800
to take her clothes
off, for free!

727
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,866
Maybe our luck's
changing for the better.

728
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:23,799
Aloha.

729
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,067
Then again, maybe it's not.

730
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,066
Back in Pahoa, Surfer
Dave's got another

731
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:32,300
spy station on my doorstep.

732
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,767
In my book he's public
enemy number one.

733
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:38,899
At least the other fuckers,

734
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,633
at least they delivered.

735
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,466
They said it was good,
and it is really good,

736
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,299
and at least they
freaking delivered.

737
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,732
They didn't take
the money and run,

738
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,167
although they tried to.

739
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,732
And it looks like I
might be under siege

740
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,667
a little longer than I'd hope.

741
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:58,132
That fucker Kimo's rented
our lava-front guesthouse

742
00:35:58,133 --> 00:35:59,233
to someone else.

743
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,432
Now, I got to break
the news to Roland.

744
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:04,866
How am I going to do that?

745
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,133
This is going to send
him over the edge.

746
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
I can't take it anymore.

747
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,100
I'm going to have
to find a new pad, pronto.

748
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:14,466
Aloha!

749
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:16,233
Hello, my love.

750
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,599
Hello there, nice to see you.

751
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,900
Oh, good to see you again.

752
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,767
You look fabulous, darling.

753
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,433
My search leads to Tara.

754
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,700
She drives me up the coast
to another rental house.

755
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,266
It's kind of like Kimo's place,

756
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,733
only a whole lot better.

757
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,766
Two bedrooms, two
baths, lush gardens,

758
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,766
a nice koi pond out back,

759
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,366
the Pacific out front,

760
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,567
and that nude beach just
a walk down the sand.

761
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:57,066
Mm, this is nice.

762
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,600
We seal the deal with a joint.

763
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,867
For a grand,
including utilities!

764
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,066
What did you do to deserve this?

765
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:07,099
I don't know.

766
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,266
I think it's what I didn't do.

767
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,432
Oh, okay.

768
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:11,067
Roland's pretty excited.

769
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:12,166
How did this happen?

770
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,132
I don't know.

771
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,432
I'm just a lucky guy.

772
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,499
Roland's a lucky guy, too.

773
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
He gets the downstairs.

774
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,532
The bad news is
he'll have to stay

775
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,732
at the Bates Motel
a little longer,

776
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:25,533
until his bathroom's finished.

777
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,367
Coming slowly, slowly.

778
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,833
He actually takes
it better than I expected.

779
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:47,067
I've realized something.

780
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,799
We were supposed to be
passing through here,

781
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,066
getting video of the locals,

782
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:55,167
then moving on to shoot the
next stop in the travelogue.

783
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:58,300
Instead, I'm
becoming one of them.

784
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,666
Kind of part of the family now.

785
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:03,600
Yeah, kind of like
the Manson family.

786
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,166
These people are
crazier than I am.

787
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,367
It'll kill you.

788
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,432
A raggedy bunch of refugees

789
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:15,233
from civilization
and the drug war.

790
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:18,132
Social misfits, dropouts,

791
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:20,433
living in huts they
built themselves.

792
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:27,167
No electricity,
no TV or internet,

793
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:37,733
just cheap land where they
can grow their own food.

794
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:39,100
And pot.

795
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,367
Be careful of the big hole.

796
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,499
This hole is easily,
I don't know,

797
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,133
several cars wide and long.

798
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:48,733
It's enormous.

799
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:51,199
And my dad always had
a chance of growing,

800
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,633
you know, huge crowds
of something down there.

801
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,632
One of the more
intriguing characters

802
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,967
in this community
is Share Christie.

803
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,632
You know, there's a
lot of purple sheep here.

804
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,132
People that didn't quite fit

805
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,266
in the communities
on the continent,

806
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:07,799
and they've come here
to just live their life

807
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,766
as peaceful as they could.

808
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:13,066
She ran for mayor
of Hilo in 2010,

809
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:16,867
the same year feds busted
pot advocate, Roger Christie.

810
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:20,533
Yeah, that's right, he's
her fucking husband.

811
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:24,067
I really should take some
time to think about that.

812
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,600
But, there's exciting
new drugs to discover.

813
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:35,666
They grind it up, blow
it in people's faces,

814
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,066
and it turns them into zombies.

815
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:41,299
They'll help you rob your house.

816
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,166
This is the zombie
drug, I heard of that.

817
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:47,067
This is the extra, oh wow!

818
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,167
Fast forward 12 hours.

819
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,967
What is that?

820
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,100
Holy shit, what
the fuck is that?

821
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,932
And what the fuck was that?

822
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,732
I don't
know, what the fuck was it?

823
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,832
You saw it, and it's crazy.

824
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,366
Oh, I love you, Dave!

825
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,832
Oh, Alien Tom, my brother!

826
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,066
All these people,
they look at me,

827
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:09,666
I don't know why they
look at me like they do,

828
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,099
but they need to be nice,

829
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,032
- they need to be keepers.
- - You're an alien.

830
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:13,666
Well yeah, obviously, I guess,

831
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,132
I'm not like anybody
else, but that's--

832
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:16,999
Well, you know, I'm
friendly to aliens.

833
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,532
What do you make
of these humans?

834
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,466
They are not observant,

835
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:21,899
and they have no idea
what they're doing.

836
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,299
What's going to happen, man?

837
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,220
They're not going to
get into the bomb shelter.

838
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,466
And I found a way
to save Hawaii.

839
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,599
And we're going to keep this,

840
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,566
but I found a way.

841
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:31,032
What we have to do is,

842
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:33,332
Hawaii can make everyone
else not relevant.

843
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,966
They could build the best,
newest bomb shelters,

844
00:40:34,967 --> 00:40:36,566
the most high tech bomb
shelters in the world,

845
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,287
just for the locals and
preferred customers.

846
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,966
I was drawn here
by the drumming.

847
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:53,632
Heard the drumming
and the whistling,

848
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:55,900
and wanted to find
the source of it.

849
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:04,567
Then, as the sun begins
to set, I meet the E girl.

850
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:06,932
E, I like E!

851
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:08,433
How about hashish?

852
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:13,266
I like E!

853
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:17,132
Wants ecstasy, you
know, that's like code

854
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,899
for fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

855
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,733
What the fuck are you doing?

856
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:29,899
I like that song.

857
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,099
Do you like it?

858
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,099
I missed the entire
conversation there,

859
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,066
it looked really good--

860
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:35,432
What the fuck is going on?

861
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:38,567
I can feel movement
in the dead zone.

862
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,732
Massive quantities
of pot and beer

863
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:46,299
and that South
American zombie drug

864
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,366
have stripped me
of all my defenses.

865
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,332
What would you like?

866
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,332
He's not that young.

867
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,300
E for tonight.

868
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:06,066
Any suspecting
individuals around here?

869
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,666
I don't know, who's this?

870
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:08,899
Hey!

871
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,066
He doesn't want to be on camera.

872
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:10,932
He's intelligent, though.

873
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,099
Or maybe he does, okay.

874
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,666
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, nudge,

875
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,400
say no more, say no more.

876
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:18,599
I'm running around to whoever

877
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,932
and seeing if they've
got any ecstasy for her.

878
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:21,866
You're kidding.

879
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:23,067
No.

880
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:25,799
Find some E man, let me know.

881
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,267
It's hard to find.

882
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:30,066
Ecstasy's hard to get.

883
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:31,866
You know, it's not the sort
of thing I do that often.

884
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:35,133
I only do it when I have sex.

885
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,432
We will be high
and looking sharp

886
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:44,566
and smiling at us and
saying, "Are you okay,

887
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:45,732
even though I know your high?"

888
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:47,167
And you'll say,
"Yeah, I'm fine!"

889
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:48,766
How's that, is that a good date?

890
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:49,833
I love it!

891
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:56,133
Television series?

892
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,600
What television series?

893
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:05,666
You're rolling?

894
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:06,933
Looks good, yeah.

895
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,833
Hello.

896
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,932
Well, here it is.

897
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,699
Here it is.

898
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,267
Who would have thunk it, hey?

899
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,432
Yeah really, who would have?

900
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:19,966
We were smoking, we're drinking,

901
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:24,833
we're taking every pill known
to man, I think, as I recall.

902
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,267
Such as?

903
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,399
I don't know what
the fuck they were,

904
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,167
but they were good, you know.

905
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,233
It's coming in.

906
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:41,832
She's a Seventh-day Adventist,

907
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:45,933
Blood of Christ,
Blood of Christ.

908
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,067
* I went to Hilo

909
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,167
* To see the volcano

910
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,800
* I met a Hawaiian girl

911
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,300
* She presented me
with lei lehua *

912
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:09,833
Refill.

913
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,567
What time is it, five o'clock?

914
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,133
That's 4:20 up there.

915
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,532
After a long night
in the cold light of day,

916
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,299
I offer the E girl a screen test

917
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,233
for my television series.

918
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:44,733
Now you can get up out of bed.

919
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,132
Don't look at me.

920
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:51,466
Just get up as if you're
getting up, like that.

921
00:44:51,467 --> 00:44:52,933
Hold on, do that again.

922
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,799
And then you just get
up, put your robe on,

923
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,332
and walk out of shot.

924
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,733
Hold on, when I say action.

925
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,166
Lay down first, you're sleeping.

926
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,700
Okay, okay, okay, up you get.

927
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,933
Oh, morning.

928
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,100
Oh god, at least
it's sunny today.

929
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:26,467
Oh, oh shit.

930
00:45:26,967 --> 00:45:28,200
Okay.

931
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,533
Good.

932
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,866
Turn around and look
straight in the camera

933
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:40,067
and hold your gaze,
and don't blink.

934
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:44,599
Again.

935
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,366
Do I have to smile or what?

936
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,066
No.

937
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:46,932
Fuck!

938
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:47,732
Only on your eyes.

939
00:45:47,733 --> 00:45:48,932
Okay, damn.

940
00:45:48,933 --> 00:45:50,766
My eyes can't smile,
they got to be serious.

941
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:52,066
What you want my eyes to do?

942
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:53,700
What do you want
them to express?

943
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,432
What would you like?

944
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:57,132
A little surprise--

945
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:58,566
- Surprise?
- Turn that way,

946
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:01,199
Turn your head, no,
not so far, a little back.

947
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,099
Okay, now I'm going
to be in closer.

948
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,300
Just turn and do the same thing.

949
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,867
Hold your stare next time.

950
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,632
Okay, that was really good.

951
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:13,532
Do it again.

952
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:14,332
Surprise, right?

953
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,067
You do want surprise.

954
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,532
I'm hungry now.

955
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:21,566
That's very good.

956
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:23,399
One more, is that it?

957
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,599
I'll buy you
lunch, I'll buy you lunch.

958
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,366
Will it be a fucking wrap?

959
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:26,700
Come on.

960
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,632
You got a crooked picture

961
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:30,532
over there in the background.

962
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:31,332
Should we straighten that?

963
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,533
That's okay.

964
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:40,567
Okay, one more time
doing a bit faster.

965
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:43,133
Just one more time.

966
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:45,566
- Oh, stop it!
- - You're killing me!

967
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:46,799
Oh, Jesus!

968
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,066
This is like fucking
Greta Garbo, come on.

969
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:50,600
I just need some value.

970
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,932
That's why they all took
drugs, I know why now.

971
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:56,067
Turn and just
look at the camera.

972
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,433
Keep looking at the camera.

973
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,800
Oh God, please.

974
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,800
Someone else can star in
tonight's nightmare.

975
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,900
So, I got the fuck out
of there, thank good.

976
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:26,499
Fucking gone, you know,
some other poor bastard

977
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,867
can deal with this.

978
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,067
My bender was just beginning.

979
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:43,133
On the way home I stop in
Pahoa for a half stuck.

980
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,732
I stumble into the
local boutique,

981
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:49,333
still fixated on that
screen test idea.

982
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,066
Shake it for me, babies!

983
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:52,432
Jesus Christ!

984
00:47:52,433 --> 00:47:53,433
Come on.

985
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:55,967
Oh, come on, come on.

986
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:57,400
Okay.

987
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:58,799
The camera loves you.

988
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,732
She's great!

989
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:01,099
This is HD camera, too.

990
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,466
Well, that's good to know.

991
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:04,766
I was feeling like I
wasn't photogenic at all.

992
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:07,266
Totally photogenic,
come over here for one moment.

993
00:48:07,267 --> 00:48:09,066
Okay,
one more, and then I'm done.

994
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:14,067
I want you to just
lean down, that's it, oh!

995
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,166
Aren't they amazing?

996
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:19,200
Okay, what breasts?

997
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:21,700
I don't see any breasts.

998
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,067
Oh, my God!

999
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:29,967
This is your brain on drugs.

1000
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,066
Oh, my God.

1001
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:34,299
Can you do what she did?

1002
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,666
What did she do?

1003
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:38,532
Not going to do it,
I'm not going to do it!

1004
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:41,599
Oh, come on now,
cuz I might not have got it.

1005
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,800
Give it to me one more time.

1006
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:46,232
You can only if you're
going to put money in there.

1007
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:48,066
It's going to
make you a lot of money.

1008
00:48:48,067 --> 00:48:51,467
Your store will be
absolutely mobbed.

1009
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,700
Put some money in there.

1010
00:48:54,633 --> 00:48:56,066
Do that one more time.

1011
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:58,100
Give me some money.

1012
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:58,967
All right.

1013
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:12,800
Of course, it went into
the night, another night.

1014
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,932
I know you're buying
me a drink, right?

1015
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:33,266
You're buying me a
stiff nog, right?

1016
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:36,067
I'll buy you a stiff anything.

1017
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,467
So, is this your camera man?

1018
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:51,933
I guess you can call him that.

1019
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:58,667
I have other names for him.

1020
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:01,999
Do that again.

1021
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,967
Can you get that low angle, man?

1022
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:05,066
And will you do that again?

1023
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:05,832
I'm thirsty.

1024
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,032
Kind of just slow.

1025
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:08,799
I might, I'm thirsty, though.

1026
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,266
Bend down and touch your toes.

1027
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:11,466
I mean, I'm thirsty, though.

1028
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,767
Okay, what do you want?

1029
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,533
Home at last.

1030
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:25,499
Oh God, fucking
morning after, man.

1031
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,267
Sipping bear and
it's not even 8:30.

1032
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:31,899
I been lost in the Pahoa
triangle for two days

1033
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,566
since meeting the E girl.

1034
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,266
What's that, from last night?

1035
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:38,566
No, that's the one,
I opened it and forgot.

1036
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:41,367
I thought, shit, that
beer went down fast!

1037
00:50:41,467 --> 00:50:43,300
And I'm still fucked up.

1038
00:50:45,867 --> 00:50:47,766
Where's that fucking
pot delivery man?

1039
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:50,700
It's 8:30, he was supposed
to be here at eight o'clock.

1040
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,466
Drying, huh?

1041
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:56,033
Yeah, home delivery.

1042
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:58,032
I'm really settled
in out here now.

1043
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,767
Is there a delivery charge?

1044
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:04,733
There's a delivery charge
even when they don't deliver!

1045
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:06,866
It costs me half the stash

1046
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:09,166
just to get it pried out
of their greedy little

1047
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:11,067
fucking grasping hand.

1048
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:15,300
You know, it's like
Charles Dickens in Hawaii.

1049
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:18,367
You know, really.

1050
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:25,733
More please, may I have more?

1051
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:28,233
Oliver Twist.

1052
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:38,867
Which one first?

1053
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,232
Help me make up my mind.

1054
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:49,400
Will I have a long
blip, or a Longboard?

1055
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:53,866
Here, this one's half done.

1056
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:56,700
I might as well finish that
before I start the other one.

1057
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:59,333
What a fucking night.

1058
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,832
I'm sleeping on the couch
with a woman telling me

1059
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:08,833
how she had a fucking
hammer embedded in her head,

1060
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,732
and then giving me the details

1061
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:12,399
of how the doctors
couldn't get it out,

1062
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,067
and they're using like a
jackhammer on her head.

1063
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,532
No kidding, it was
like I couldn't sleep.

1064
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:21,367
I fell off the couch.

1065
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:22,866
You slept on a couch?

1066
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:26,900
With her, yeah, it was
the only bed in the place.

1067
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,132
I don't know, Dave,

1068
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:31,813
it seems like you're
quite popular in town.

1069
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,332
I don't know.

1070
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,533
What is it?

1071
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,567
I don't know, I guess,
I really don't know.

1072
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,066
I buy them drinks!

1073
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:47,467
I buy them drinks and drugs.

1074
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,666
The way to a girl's heart!

1075
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:53,100
I don't want a heart, I
want the tits, oh yes!

1076
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:57,267
What a man will go through
to grope a set of tits, huh?

1077
00:52:58,067 --> 00:53:00,900
I'm disgusting,
I disgust myself.

1078
00:53:02,533 --> 00:53:04,666
Sometimes I make myself so sick.

1079
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:06,767
Now my lighter won't work.

1080
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:08,733
Oh, fuck.

1081
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:10,767
What's the plan today?

1082
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,700
I don't know, I guess I'm
going to get hagged again.

1083
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,532
The hag net? No, don't do it!

1084
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:22,799
Don't do it, Dave!

1085
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,632
I can't help it!

1086
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:24,666
Don't do it!

1087
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,267
I can't help it!

1088
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:30,499
You know, I even
attracted hags like,

1089
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,933
you know, iron shavings.

1090
00:53:38,067 --> 00:53:39,866
They stick to me,
they work like gum.

1091
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:41,632
Don't know what it is.

1092
00:53:41,633 --> 00:53:44,166
What have I got, what is it?

1093
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:49,167
You know, they're too old,
not pretty, they love me.

1094
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,499
Guess I pay them
attention, I think.

1095
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,899
That's the secret.

1096
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,899
You know, fawn all
over them, lie to them,

1097
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,567
tell them they're
fucking beautiful.

1098
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:06,333
Ejaculate and get the fuck
out of there.

1099
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:14,667
Wipe off the DNA off the table!

1100
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:23,932
I should have
listened to Roland,

1101
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:26,567
taken his advice and dried up.

1102
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:35,900
Instead, I'm right
back at the bar.

1103
00:54:36,067 --> 00:54:38,066
Ah, aloha, aloha!

1104
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,367
Aloha!

1105
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:41,167
Aloha.

1106
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:44,500
Aloha!

1107
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,133
Suddenly I see
Roland's rental car,

1108
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,166
and I realize he's following me.

1109
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:55,633
Fuck you, you son of a bitch!

1110
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:58,066
Come here, you fucker, yeah!

1111
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:58,899
There's a cop down there.

1112
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,866
I don't care!

1113
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:00,832
You're going to get arrested.

1114
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:01,700
I'm not smoking.

1115
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,200
You're fucked up!

1116
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,466
I've never seen
Roland so fucking pissed.

1117
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:09,633
Come on, want to go?

1118
00:55:12,933 --> 00:55:17,367
I remind him I know
feng shui, and it's over.

1119
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,467
Maybe for good.

1120
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,200
It's been close to a week
since Roland's intervention.

1121
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:32,299
It didn't work.

1122
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,067
My round the clock binge
is entering day 10.

1123
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,166
And I don't know where
the fuck Roland is.

1124
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:41,832
He hasn't picked up my calls,

1125
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,732
or returned my messages.

1126
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:47,633
For all I know, my designated
driver's back in LA.

1127
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:48,667
Great.

1128
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,232
Oh freedom, I can't let you go.

1129
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:54,832
So, it's just me and
my little HD cam.

1130
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:56,633
But the way my
hands are shaking,

1131
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,833
I could probably
use a steady cam.

1132
00:56:04,767 --> 00:56:06,966
What did he say?
Coconut culture?

1133
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:09,100
Coconut culture, herbalology.

1134
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,332
Herbanomics.

1135
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,066
Herbanomics!

1136
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:15,066
I figure maybe Tony
can take over Roland's gig.

1137
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:16,499
How do I do it?

1138
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,799
Just frame me up, it's rolling.

1139
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,766
Oh, okay.

1140
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,066
You're going to love this one.

1141
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:22,332
Very slowly, while
you were drinking it,

1142
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,599
I went to it and it's
just the top of Bala,

1143
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,232
and Bala's taking
a hit off the pipe

1144
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:27,799
and all you see is the
top so Bala's head,

1145
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,199
and he's smoking off the pipe!

1146
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,066
But you're still drinking,
I was like real slow,

1147
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:33,832
and I'm like, and then you
see Bala in the background.

1148
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:36,399
You're going to love that,
you're going to love what I did!

1149
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,067
Roland who? Who needs that fuck?

1150
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:42,932
You realize you've interrupted
my work here, don't you?

1151
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:46,100
Severely,
but you needed a break.

1152
00:56:46,433 --> 00:56:48,332
It's LeAnn, the tile lady,

1153
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:51,433
working on what was going
to be Roland's bathroom.

1154
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:54,099
That's the great fucking secret.

1155
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,133
You cough like me!

1156
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:57,766
I did need a break, yeah.

1157
00:56:57,767 --> 00:56:59,066
You were exhausted.

1158
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:00,232
You know what?

1159
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:01,593
These two hour days
are killing me!

1160
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:06,766
You know what?

1161
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:07,932
After a joint and
a couple of beers,

1162
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:10,133
LeAnn looks pretty good for 68.

1163
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:12,832
You look good on camera,
you have good lines.

1164
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,066
I doubt it.

1165
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:15,600
God, you're awfully close there.

1166
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:18,433
I wonder what
she looks like at 69.

1167
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,432
Start the tea.

1168
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:20,433
It's a damn fine joint.

1169
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,467
Oh, it's huge!

1170
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,600
All the girls say that!

1171
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:32,699
The rest is easy.

1172
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,632
Would you like to do
a screen test for me?

1173
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:35,766
No.

1174
00:57:35,767 --> 00:57:37,699
Really? It's really nothing.

1175
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:42,067
It's easy, it'll take two
minutes, it's painless.

1176
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:47,567
You simply disrobe, I'll
see how you look on camera.

1177
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,267
Right!

1178
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:53,166
What do you think?

1179
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:54,332
Yeah, yeah, then what do I do

1180
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:55,932
after I get the
rejection notice?

1181
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:57,166
Would you like a beer?

1182
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:58,232
No, I wouldn't.

1183
00:57:58,233 --> 00:57:59,399
You sure?

1184
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,699
Yeah.

1185
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,866
It'll relax you
for your screen test.

1186
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:03,432
No, I don't need
to be that relaxed.

1187
00:58:03,433 --> 00:58:04,833
You don't?

1188
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,399
Are you comfortable doing

1189
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,266
a nude screen test
for me, my dear?

1190
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:11,267
Not at all, not at all!

1191
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,400
You don't mind?

1192
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:14,866
Would you?

1193
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,400
He takes no for an answer!

1194
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:17,699
Oh, you said no?

1195
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,932
He takes no.

1196
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:20,400
Oh, I thought
you were saying yes.

1197
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:21,966
LeAnn, my sweet!

1198
00:58:21,967 --> 00:58:23,133
Stay back!

1199
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,266
We have to think
of something new!

1200
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,566
Did you say yes or no?

1201
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:27,932
I said no, N-O!

1202
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:29,199
Now, hold on, we set it up,

1203
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,532
we've got the suspense now.

1204
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:34,499
If you did this, you would
be the star of an art movie.

1205
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,666
So boring.

1206
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:36,632
Okay, you had your chance!

1207
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,767
So boring!

1208
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,066
This is how Marilyn
Monroe got discovered.

1209
00:58:41,067 --> 00:58:42,766
What if she said no?

1210
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:44,900
That's a hell of a
shower you got there.

1211
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:49,600
Have you seen my
shower upstairs?

1212
00:58:50,067 --> 00:58:51,667
Yes, I have.

1213
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,432
Would you like to see it again?

1214
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,667
No, I wouldn't.

1215
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,600
You're not very good at this!

1216
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:05,332
Thank God the E girl's
not finished with me yet.

1217
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,299
Hey, come here
for one sec, love.

1218
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,432
Sweetie!

1219
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:09,599
Please help me.

1220
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,332
I'm trying to work
out this camera.

1221
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:12,532
I need you, please.

1222
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:14,799
Please, what have I
done for you lately?

1223
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,066
Nothing!

1224
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:18,933
Okay, walk in here, let me test.

1225
00:59:19,133 --> 00:59:21,466
I won't use it without your
permission, I promise you.

1226
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:22,699
You love me.

1227
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,867
Just come in here, come in here.

1228
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,266
Walk this way.

1229
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:28,066
I've got to see if this works.

1230
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:30,832
No, I am not going to
bare my fucking makeup--

1231
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,332
You don't,
you've got a towel on.

1232
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,432
I am not going to be makeup-less

1233
00:59:33,433 --> 00:59:35,967
on to the LA camera, no way.

1234
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,299
Are we on?

1235
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,766
I'm dressed, yes I'm dressed.

1236
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,132
You want me to buy this?

1237
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:47,166
Well, I think so.

1238
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,632
I do look very hard.

1239
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:50,466
It's very difficult
to be on camera.

1240
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:52,066
No, just say it's real hard.

1241
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:53,967
It's just really hard.

1242
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:10,066
And right back here,
on the back of his neck.

1243
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:11,499
Eeough, Eeough!

1244
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,932
It looks like a little,
almost like a mosquito bite.

1245
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:14,666
Oh shit, and
that's how it starts out.

1246
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:16,199
Turned out big as a basketball.

1247
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,900
Cover me up!

1248
01:00:22,467 --> 01:00:24,433
And the party's just started.

1249
01:00:25,033 --> 01:00:26,532
Well, I just got here, man!

1250
01:00:26,533 --> 01:00:27,899
You're my favorite martian!

1251
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,799
Much love, brother!

1252
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,599
Oh, brother!

1253
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,667
It's the alien.

1254
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:33,199
He's a Jezy freak like I am,

1255
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,933
he's a Jezy freak like
I am, a Jezy freak!

1256
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,767
And Daryl, some
guy the E girl knows.

1257
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:42,733
She's naked and everything!

1258
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,867
And he's got more
refreshments at his place.

1259
01:00:51,867 --> 01:00:54,032
Best that you
have, big or small,

1260
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:55,499
it's not what you got.

1261
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,032
Per usual, no
electricity or running water,

1262
01:00:59,033 --> 01:01:00,967
but refreshments
are going to do.

1263
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,133
That's Andrea, Daryl's wife.

1264
01:01:07,733 --> 01:01:10,233
That's the E girl,
hitting on Daryl.

1265
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,967
That's me hitting on Andrea.

1266
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,267
That's the alien
hitting on the E girl.

1267
01:01:23,067 --> 01:01:24,967
Looks like we've
got us a love-in.

1268
01:01:35,367 --> 01:01:38,167
Andrea, just smoke it.

1269
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:48,733
Okay, now Andrea it's your turn!

1270
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,932
Everything's
going just as planned.

1271
01:03:07,933 --> 01:03:10,233
Thank you Lord, you are good!

1272
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:15,333
David, your life is errant,
and we are the cloud.

1273
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:18,200
We are the cloud, brother.

1274
01:03:18,267 --> 01:03:21,499
We are at 700 megahertz,
we are the cloud.

1275
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,532
We own the world in a word.

1276
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,399
We can stop it
all with a breath,

1277
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,600
because we know how to
mix the words they can't.

1278
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:29,532
We are the future.

1279
01:03:29,533 --> 01:03:30,667
We're on the island.

1280
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:34,732
Fucking right
on, we are gypsies!

1281
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:36,232
We are nomads,

1282
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:39,832
and no land is our
nomad land, right?

1283
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:42,267
We are fucking gypsies!

1284
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:46,167
They're fucked up,
they are so fucked!

1285
01:03:48,133 --> 01:03:50,399
Like that, I can read the
dots and read the zone zeros.

1286
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,700
Biometric code is.

1287
01:03:58,267 --> 01:03:59,767
Fuck you!

1288
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,600
That's not even a way
not to do the job, mama.

1289
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,900
* I went to Hilo

1290
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:25,200
* To see the volcano

1291
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,067
* I met a Hawaiian girl

1292
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:34,600
* She presented me
with lei lehua *

1293
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:44,167
Day 12 and my
binge is rudely interrupted.

1294
01:04:45,233 --> 01:04:48,100
An unexpected phone call
from Share Christie.

1295
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:51,900
Okay, well is there a chance
could get together today?

1296
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:55,733
She says she wants to
discuss something, in person.

1297
01:04:56,067 --> 01:04:58,132
It sounds serious.

1298
01:04:58,133 --> 01:05:01,133
I sure hope she hasn't gone
online and found my bio.

1299
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,166
We meet at a popular spot

1300
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,767
where drinking for 12 hours
straight is smiled upon,

1301
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,232
and where the no-smoking
signs ban cigarettes,

1302
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:12,833
but not pot.

1303
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,232
It's known as the healing pool.

1304
01:05:15,233 --> 01:05:17,099
A kind of local Lourdes,

1305
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,299
where the sick come
seeking miracles

1306
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,899
from the magic waters.

1307
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,866
Hi, nice to meet you.

1308
01:05:22,867 --> 01:05:24,200
Aloha.

1309
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:26,500
And Share Christie
could use a miracle.

1310
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,132
She and her husband Roger
are facing up to 40 years

1311
01:05:31,133 --> 01:05:34,200
in the federal pen in
that THC Ministry case.

1312
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:39,467
They're among 14 people charged
with marijuana trafficking.

1313
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,667
Everyone but Roger
got out on bail.

1314
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,466
He's been locked up

1315
01:05:45,467 --> 01:05:47,767
for more than four
years without a trial.

1316
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:51,499
From the third time that
he was let out on bail,

1317
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,866
I said, "Oh my God, he
is a political prisoner."

1318
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,932
Oh, I guess
Share did look up my bio.

1319
01:05:55,933 --> 01:05:59,732
She wants me to get some
national attention on the case.

1320
01:05:59,733 --> 01:06:02,366
Listen up, I'd going
to talk to him.

1321
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,532
I call Roland again,

1322
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:08,299
and leave a voice mail about
the Christie development.

1323
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,166
This is a really
good one for Geraldo,

1324
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,066
he loves legal shit like this.

1325
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:14,766
This time he picks up in
the middle of the message,

1326
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:16,932
around the part
where I mention money

1327
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:20,133
and selling the story to one
of the big TV news shows.

1328
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,733
But Roland interrupts and
tells me to stop talking.

1329
01:06:24,433 --> 01:06:26,700
His spyware's detected a bug.

1330
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:29,100
Someone's listening in on us.

1331
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:32,933
Holy shit, our fucking
phones are tapped.

1332
01:06:36,067 --> 01:06:37,799
Surfer Dave and Roseanne

1333
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,467
are just two insignificant
memories now.

1334
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:44,100
Paranoia has taken over.

1335
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,167
Then again, is is
paranoia if it's real?

1336
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,666
I knew what the NSA was doing,

1337
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:54,067
I just didn't know they
were doing it to me.

1338
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,600
I'm seeing federal agents
behind trees, under rocks.

1339
01:06:59,467 --> 01:07:01,866
I got to get my stuff
out of the beachhouse

1340
01:07:01,867 --> 01:07:04,367
and get off this island
before it's too late.

1341
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,933
Hey!

1342
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:08,700
It's Tara the landlady.

1343
01:07:09,933 --> 01:07:11,200
Who goes there?

1344
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:14,133
And what the fuck?

1345
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:17,300
God, we're glad you're alive.

1346
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,933
First time I've
seen Roland in nine days.

1347
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,399
Nice to see you, mother fucker.

1348
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,599
Yeah.

1349
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,067
Thanks for
leaving me, you bastard.

1350
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,532
Now you're back,

1351
01:07:27,533 --> 01:07:28,966
and I supposed you want
me to welcome you in, huh?

1352
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:30,132
Well, it's up to you.

1353
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,566
Fuck you.

1354
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:34,133
Just got to be sure this
isn't another AA intervention.

1355
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,467
Oh, I missed you my boy!

1356
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,900
Come in.

1357
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:41,666
I missed you, man.

1358
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:42,866
I guess not.

1359
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:44,600
You don't bring beer
to an intervention.

1360
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:47,867
But this is worse.

1361
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:50,199
Roland and Tara are an item.

1362
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,566
I missed you, brother.

1363
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,766
I'm so glad you got here.

1364
01:07:52,767 --> 01:07:54,532
I was worried, I
thought, no, shit.

1365
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:56,433
These are from Tara.

1366
01:07:58,433 --> 01:08:00,767
I thought I told
him I wanted to fuck her.

1367
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,433
Fucking prick.

1368
01:08:04,233 --> 01:08:05,967
You fuck.

1369
01:08:06,267 --> 01:08:07,566
How could you do that?

1370
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:09,166
You fucking piece of shit.

1371
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:10,866
Since he went AWOL on me,

1372
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:12,432
that sneaky
bastard's been living

1373
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:14,800
at her island spread, rent free.

1374
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,232
This is my
new room at the estate.

1375
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:19,900
It's really incredible.

1376
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:21,933
That's it, that's it, you know,

1377
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,932
he settled down with Tara,

1378
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,366
have a nice, happy
fucking life, you know.

1379
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:28,432
Be Tara's bat boy,

1380
01:08:28,433 --> 01:08:31,567
and you know, I'll get
back to see my kid.

1381
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:36,400
You know, maybe get a job as
a Walmart greeter somewhere.

1382
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,832
On the plus side,

1383
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:39,166
I won't be hearing him whine

1384
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:41,133
about the Bates Motel anymore.

1385
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:43,967
And I do have my shooter back.

1386
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:46,200
Oh, that sick face.

1387
01:08:46,633 --> 01:08:47,932
Hold on, go back a bit.

1388
01:08:47,933 --> 01:08:50,099
With this new contraption
he's rigged up,

1389
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,467
he's looking more
like a gynecologist.

1390
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:54,133
What's the plan?

1391
01:08:55,933 --> 01:08:58,633
What's a plan?

1392
01:09:06,933 --> 01:09:08,632
And all you have to do is say,

1393
01:09:08,633 --> 01:09:11,400
"I knew I should have
brought the gas mask."

1394
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,632
I knew I should
have brought the gas mask.

1395
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:15,833
That's good.

1396
01:09:16,267 --> 01:09:17,500
Look at that.

1397
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:20,267
I might have to wind
it around a bit later.

1398
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:23,667
Still fucking make
out what it is!

1399
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,500
Now you're starting
to look like Colonel Sanders.

1400
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,266
Right.

1401
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:29,599
I knew I should
have brought the gas mask.

1402
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,666
He's starting to look
like Colonel Sanders.

1403
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,466
Flat.

1404
01:09:32,467 --> 01:09:33,899
Yeah, flat.

1405
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,732
I knew I should
have brought the gas mask.

1406
01:09:35,733 --> 01:09:38,666
He's starting to look
like Colonel Sanders.

1407
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:40,732
I knew I should
have brought the gas mask.

1408
01:09:40,733 --> 01:09:43,166
He's starting to look
like Colonel Sanders.

1409
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:45,599
That's it, that's the believer.

1410
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,566
That's the one that
works, we got you.

1411
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:50,233
We got plenty to cut
with, have a look at it.

1412
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:52,066
Once the tests are
out of the way,

1413
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,467
I bring him up to date on
the latest developments.

1414
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,366
Yeah, what was I going to say?

1415
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:58,532
I don't know.

1416
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:00,299
Can't fucking remember,
it was important.

1417
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,099
It's not just the
phones being tapped.

1418
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,832
I think my laptop's been hacked

1419
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,499
because Share Christie
went and put me

1420
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,832
on her husband's
prison email list.

1421
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:10,399
There's some deep,
dark fucking conspiracy

1422
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,167
going on with this.

1423
01:10:12,233 --> 01:10:15,332
On the street, at the
beach, wherever I go,

1424
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:17,467
I feel I'm being watched.

1425
01:10:17,533 --> 01:10:18,966
Aloha.

1426
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:20,967
And they don't look
like Surfer Dave's spies.

1427
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:24,267
They look like those
law enforcement types.

1428
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,299
This is very
fucking frightening.

1429
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,232
It's like the rise of
the goddamn Fourth Reich.

1430
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:31,232
Now Share's ready
to spill her guts

1431
01:10:31,233 --> 01:10:35,100
on the marijuana church
and puke all over the DEA.

1432
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:37,867
I don't want anything
to do with this shit.

1433
01:10:39,367 --> 01:10:40,967
You know what that says?

1434
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:48,400
Dot dash dash dash dot, SOS!

1435
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,900
Get my fucking foot weights now!

1436
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,766
All I want to do is
direct naked screen tests

1437
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:01,700
and get fucked up.

1438
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,067
And then it hits me.

1439
01:11:21,433 --> 01:11:25,066
The booze, the pot, the drugs,

1440
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:29,367
the sex, the paranoia.

1441
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,766
I don't know if I'm
sweating from an overdose,

1442
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:36,500
fear, or the fucking humidity.

1443
01:11:38,467 --> 01:11:40,433
Fuck this humidity.

1444
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:43,667
In two showers I'm
still soaking wet.

1445
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,932
I don't know what it is.

1446
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:47,466
It could be the alcoholism,

1447
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:52,467
I could have TB,
dengue fever, scurvy.

1448
01:11:55,567 --> 01:11:57,899
Anyway, this is a trick I found

1449
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,933
that is effective
in the tropics,

1450
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:02,332
you know, especially when

1451
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:04,200
your girlfriend's
about to come over.

1452
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,532
You don't have time
to take a shower.

1453
01:12:06,533 --> 01:12:08,967
Some nutcase turns
up on your door.

1454
01:12:09,067 --> 01:12:10,733
You just do this,

1455
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:13,332
and it pretty much, you know,

1456
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:16,167
freshens you up pretty good.

1457
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:22,300
Is that an old outback trick?

1458
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:23,767
I don't know.

1459
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:25,833
Yeah, my dad taught me.

1460
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,299
This is good, too.

1461
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,932
I don't want to go anywhere
near the Christie's

1462
01:12:28,933 --> 01:12:30,499
or their marijuana church.

1463
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,633
I don't want to
piss off the DEA.

1464
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,300
I need a break.

1465
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,067
I want to get the
fuck out of here.

1466
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,900
I'm scared.

1467
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:45,067
Mummy, I want my mummy!

1468
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:50,233
But Roland sees money in it.

1469
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:53,100
So, I tail off and
head back to my source.

1470
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,367
My Deep Shit.

1471
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:57,367
Well, this was a
place of empowerment.

1472
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,833
There's a reason he
wants to stay anonymous.

1473
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,499
He was one of the first
ministers ordained

1474
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,067
into Roger Christie's
THC church.

1475
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:09,432
Roger has
always been quite brilliant.

1476
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:11,966
He was in the
military in the 70's.

1477
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:15,132
He was trained to be
military intelligence.

1478
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:17,466
Being that he was
trained to be CIA,

1479
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:20,299
and that he was
pushing the envelope

1480
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,932
where people were
going into court cases

1481
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:26,499
and using the
defense of sacrament,

1482
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,566
and using cannabis
sacerdotally, and winning,

1483
01:13:30,567 --> 01:13:33,333
caused him to be a hot
potato, so to speak.

1484
01:13:33,767 --> 01:13:37,199
Reverend Deep Shit would
have been the 15th offender,

1485
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,866
if he hadn't seen red flags

1486
01:13:38,867 --> 01:13:41,400
a couple of months
before the DEA moved in.

1487
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:44,099
At that point,

1488
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:49,100
I personally felt like it
was time to just back away,

1489
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:51,367
like it was really
getting dangerous.

1490
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:54,466
What, reckless people,
people doing reckless things?

1491
01:13:54,467 --> 01:13:56,766
Not necessarily reckless,

1492
01:13:56,767 --> 01:14:01,767
but attitudes as to how to
handle business changed.

1493
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:08,066
Okay, I got you.

1494
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:10,499
And that's
when these influences of,

1495
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,832
this is a business
type of thing,

1496
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:17,833
and hours of operation
became hours of operation

1497
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:19,899
rather than an open ministry.

1498
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,266
It all came down to this.

1499
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:25,166
Roger Christie's ministry
was handing out free pot,

1500
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,332
and raking in more than

1501
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:28,633
a million dollars a
year on donations.

1502
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:32,800
He was just too successful
for his own good.

1503
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:34,699
When you start
messing with people's money

1504
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:38,232
on those levels, people get mad,

1505
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:40,399
and they're going to go
after the figurehead,

1506
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,800
they're going to go after
the head of the dragon.

1507
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:46,067
Could it get any more fucked up?

1508
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:48,800
What the hell
happened last night?

1509
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,766
I'm in fear for my life,

1510
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:54,667
and Roland's living as a
kept man at ChÃ¢teau Tara.

1511
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,566
That remote
control's not for a TV.

1512
01:15:07,567 --> 01:15:09,167
That's for my bed.

1513
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,567
It's fucking leave it
to fucking beaver, isn't it?

1514
01:15:25,533 --> 01:15:28,067
Oh, look at the happy family!

1515
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:30,166
I'm going to
rinse these just in case.

1516
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,300
I feel like the
spare prick at a wedding.

1517
01:15:32,633 --> 01:15:34,800
Don't touch me, I'm sterile.

1518
01:15:34,867 --> 01:15:36,366
They actually forced me to watch

1519
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:38,332
a home movie they made together.

1520
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,933
And maybe slightly
a little bit in love.

1521
01:15:42,267 --> 01:15:43,967
At first I want to puke.

1522
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:45,900
Then I go into shock.

1523
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:54,366
This is Roland,
now on his seventh shot.

1524
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:55,667
No way, seven?

1525
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:57,066
Wow, that's smooth.

1526
01:15:57,067 --> 01:15:58,432
In the entire
time I've known him,

1527
01:15:58,433 --> 01:16:00,699
I've never known
Roland to drink a drop.

1528
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,066
And here on your eighth shot,

1529
01:16:04,067 --> 01:16:07,067
Roland is not yet
slurring his words.

1530
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,967
And here he
is, wasted on tequila.

1531
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:12,799
That's good, that's good.

1532
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,499
He's getting pot, a
little skin, some fur,

1533
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,099
a good combination.

1534
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,066
And I can't believe it.

1535
01:16:20,067 --> 01:16:21,399
He's actually smoking pot.

1536
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,066
Tasty.

1537
01:16:22,067 --> 01:16:22,866
Yeah.

1538
01:16:22,867 --> 01:16:24,332
It really is tasty.

1539
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:26,067
No effect, though.

1540
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:30,767
Right on cue.

1541
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:32,533
I'm okay.

1542
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,266
Okay!

1543
01:16:34,267 --> 01:16:39,267
Well, we're going to
have to, by the way,

1544
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:43,500
he's still not
slurring his words!

1545
01:16:55,633 --> 01:16:58,733
Roland's found a
girl, and I've lost one.

1546
01:17:00,467 --> 01:17:05,433
No, I hope she's not
fucking dead.

1547
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,867
Not the E girl.

1548
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:13,333
Yeah, and I could be a
suspect if there's foul play.

1549
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:16,100
I had a feeling
something was wrong.

1550
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:21,100
So, this is about a week
before she goes missing.

1551
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:24,266
Hey sweetie, it's Catherine!

1552
01:17:24,267 --> 01:17:25,799
And I got this one, too.

1553
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,532
I'm clean and
sober for a week now.

1554
01:17:27,533 --> 01:17:30,466
I got anointed by my
girlfriend from church.

1555
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:32,066
She did the John
the Baptist on me

1556
01:17:32,067 --> 01:17:34,299
and we moved 47
spirits out of me.

1557
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,566
It was amazing!

1558
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:36,832
So, I feel really clear.

1559
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:39,932
No more alcohol for a week

1560
01:17:39,933 --> 01:17:41,232
since I got arrested.

1561
01:17:41,233 --> 01:17:43,066
Fuck, what if it's a hit?

1562
01:17:43,067 --> 01:17:44,632
And what if I'm
going to get framed

1563
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:47,600
because of the Christie's
and the marijuana church.

1564
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:54,500
It's a little bit
disturbing, Roland.

1565
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,099
My fears escalate when
Share Christie shows up

1566
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,967
at the beach house to
talk about the case.

1567
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:03,799
I get it.

1568
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,833
The feds don't like
Roger Christie.

1569
01:18:06,133 --> 01:18:08,400
Eight times denied bail.

1570
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:12,267
Why was he denied bail?

1571
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,666
They say he's a
danger to his community.

1572
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:18,699
We want to know whose community,

1573
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,100
cuz it isn't ours.

1574
01:18:20,767 --> 01:18:23,467
Something's very wrong here.

1575
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:26,433
They must be
really scared of him.

1576
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,066
I think they must
be or something.

1577
01:18:29,067 --> 01:18:30,733
It's very odd.

1578
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:35,166
Done all kinds of things
like mirrored the computer,

1579
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:36,532
tapped the phone, and all that.

1580
01:18:36,533 --> 01:18:38,300
So, now she tells me.

1581
01:18:38,933 --> 01:18:42,632
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

1582
01:18:42,633 --> 01:18:46,400
10, 11 beers, and it's
not even 10 o'clock.

1583
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,866
It doesn't matter how
many beers I drink now.

1584
01:18:49,867 --> 01:18:53,167
Even the pot's not working
on me, has no effect.

1585
01:18:53,733 --> 01:18:55,833
I'm un-sedatable.

1586
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,567
I got to get back to LA, and
get the fuck out of here.

1587
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:01,699
I don't have many options

1588
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:04,500
before I'm framed,
busted, or killed.

1589
01:19:06,133 --> 01:19:09,066
My final wish is that Roland
completes the travel show.

1590
01:19:09,067 --> 01:19:11,333
I don't know, this could
be the last hurrah for me.

1591
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,100
This shall be my masterpiece.

1592
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,800
My finest work!

1593
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:23,833
Oh yes, they shall
remember Dave High.

1594
01:19:24,567 --> 01:19:28,433
And I grant Roland what could
be my last interview, ever.

1595
01:19:28,567 --> 01:19:29,799
I don't get it, Dave.

1596
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,900
Why does everyone
have to be nude?

1597
01:19:32,733 --> 01:19:34,166
Do it again.

1598
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:36,767
Just say flat, "Why does
everyone have to be nude?"

1599
01:19:37,067 --> 01:19:39,133
Why does
everyone have to be nude?

1600
01:19:41,367 --> 01:19:43,967
It's never really
let me down, Roland.

1601
01:19:44,733 --> 01:19:47,066
Oh, and sex sells,

1602
01:19:47,067 --> 01:19:49,067
and you got to go for
that shot, you know?

1603
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:54,167
Sex, nudity, bestiality, incest,

1604
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,732
nothing's out of bounds,

1605
01:19:57,733 --> 01:19:59,499
and I'm prepared to go anywhere.

1606
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,499
You know, it's a
shock proof society,

1607
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,467
and I can't shock them
the way I used to.

1608
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,932
You know, that just
means what I used to do

1609
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,600
doesn't shock anyone anymore.

1610
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:11,332
So now I'm going to
go for the shock,

1611
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:14,200
nothing's out of the
question, you know.

1612
01:20:15,433 --> 01:20:17,767
I believe in nude, you know.

1613
01:20:20,367 --> 01:20:25,367
It's naked, sex,
drugs, booze, idiocy,

1614
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
horrible degenerate stuff.

1615
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:35,566
I mean, that's what
people want to see.

1616
01:20:35,567 --> 01:20:37,132
Give them all they fucking want.

1617
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:39,367
Why do you like
getting fucked up so much?

1618
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,400
Do it again.

1619
01:20:44,567 --> 01:20:46,633
Why do you like
getting fucked up so much?

1620
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,632
I just do it, you know,

1621
01:20:48,633 --> 01:20:50,399
you fucking live till you die.

1622
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,866
Yeah, it'll kill you,

1623
01:20:51,867 --> 01:20:56,767
but it won't kill you any
quicker than anything else.

1624
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:01,299
You know, cigarettes,
booze, pot,

1625
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,366
mushrooms, drugs, acid,

1626
01:21:03,367 --> 01:21:05,699
step right up, step right up.

1627
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,266
You know, it's just a
bit of a fucking joke,

1628
01:21:08,267 --> 01:21:10,900
you know, just people
forgot to laugh.

1629
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,067
Have you ever
thought about going to rehab?

1630
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,667
Do it again, lower, flatter,

1631
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:34,133
"You ever thought about
going into rehab?"

1632
01:21:35,233 --> 01:21:37,667
Have you ever
thought about going to rehab?

1633
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,566
It's the woman
who got the hammer

1634
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,300
stuck in her head.

1635
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:49,633
She's drunk and wants me to
meet her at Uncle Robert's.

1636
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:52,432
Roland's happy to get rid of me.

1637
01:21:52,433 --> 01:21:53,967
He drops me there.

1638
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,432
I could always
sleep on the beach.

1639
01:21:55,433 --> 01:21:57,267
Will you come get
me in the morning?

1640
01:22:05,633 --> 01:22:06,866
Once before I die

1641
01:22:06,867 --> 01:22:10,066
I want to lay on my
back on the black sand,

1642
01:22:10,067 --> 01:22:12,066
look up at the moon and stars,

1643
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:14,233
and get some hammerhead.

1644
01:22:21,367 --> 01:22:23,732
It's Monday
morning, about eight o'clock.

1645
01:22:23,733 --> 01:22:25,467
I have no idea where Dave is.

1646
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,166
We left him over there
near the lava fields,

1647
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:30,899
and he was going to spend
the night on the beach.

1648
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,566
Went over there, can't find him.

1649
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:34,332
We have no idea where he's at.

1650
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:37,133
I'm just backtracking from
where we left him last night.

1651
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,832
Have you seen Dave?

1652
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,399
No, I haven't seen Dave.

1653
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,632
Have you seen Dave?

1654
01:22:42,633 --> 01:22:43,800
No.

1655
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,366
Have you seen Dave?

1656
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:47,600
No.

1657
01:22:49,233 --> 01:22:50,667
Have you seen Dave?

1658
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,166
Have you seen Dave?

1659
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,366
Dave who?

1660
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:56,732
And no sign of hammerhead,

1661
01:22:56,733 --> 01:22:58,966
either the woman I left
him with last night,

1662
01:22:58,967 --> 01:23:00,766
I only got a quick
glimpse of her.

1663
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:03,067
I don't know who she
is, or where she lives.

1664
01:23:03,767 --> 01:23:05,733
I'll go take a second look.

1665
01:23:06,067 --> 01:23:07,833
I hope everything's okay.

1666
01:23:08,633 --> 01:23:10,667
The town folks have
mounted a search party,

1667
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:16,333
and drug-sniffing dogs are
trying to pick up Dave's scent.

1668
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:20,532
I'm really getting worried now,

1669
01:23:20,533 --> 01:23:22,500
he's been gone over 12 hours.

1670
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:25,432
He may have fallen in the ocean,

1671
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:27,933
or swept away by the high tide.

1672
01:23:30,633 --> 01:23:31,933
I couldn't find him.

1673
01:23:32,367 --> 01:23:33,900
What happened to him?

1674
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:36,833
Who knows?

1675
01:23:36,933 --> 01:23:38,166
He could be dead, you know.

1676
01:23:38,167 --> 01:23:39,066
I think you're right,

1677
01:23:39,067 --> 01:23:41,732
the waves, the tides.

1678
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:44,933
Oh no, don't say that!

1679
01:24:05,067 --> 01:24:07,066
* Man, what's a matter
with that cat there

1680
01:24:07,067 --> 01:24:08,932
* Must be he's going
to report a reefer

1681
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:10,066
* Yeah man

1682
01:24:10,067 --> 01:24:11,432
* Mean that cat's high

1683
01:24:11,433 --> 01:24:14,266
* Very sadly likely

1684
01:24:14,267 --> 01:24:16,099
* You get away from here

1685
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:17,499
* Man, is that the reefer man

1686
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,799
* That's the reefer man

1687
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,432
* I believe he's losing his mind

1688
01:24:20,433 --> 01:24:21,900
* I think he's lost his mind

1689
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:46,466
* Oh have you ever met
that funny reefer man

1690
01:24:46,467 --> 01:24:47,699
* Reefer man

1691
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,266
* Have you ever met
that funny reefer man

1692
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:51,332
* Reefer man

1693
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:53,132
* If he says he swan to China

1694
01:24:53,133 --> 01:24:55,099
* And he'll see
you South Carolina

1695
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,799
* Then you know you're
talking to that reefer man

1696
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,066
* Reefer man

1697
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:01,599
* Have you ever met
that funny reefer man

1698
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,832
* Reefer man

1699
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:05,299
* Have you ever met
that funny reefer man

1700
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,266
* Reefer man

1701
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,099
* If he says he walks the ocean

1702
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,066
* Anytime he takes the notion

1703
01:25:10,067 --> 01:25:12,832
* Then you know you're
talking to the reefer man

1704
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:14,067
* Reefer man

1705
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:31,732
* Have you ever met
this funny reefer man

1706
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:32,666
* Reefer man

1707
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:35,566
* Oh baby, reefer man

1708
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:36,799
* Reefer man

1709
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,299
* If he trades you
dimes for nickels

1710
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,966
* And calls watermelon pickles

1711
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:42,766
* Then you know you're
talking to that reefer man

1712
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:43,932
* Reefer man

1713
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:46,699
* Have you ever met
a funny reefer man

1714
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:47,866
* Reefer man

1715
01:25:47,867 --> 01:25:50,432
* Have you ever met
a funny reefer man

1716
01:25:50,433 --> 01:25:51,466
* Reefer man

1717
01:25:51,467 --> 01:25:53,066
* If he takes a sudden mania

1718
01:25:53,067 --> 01:25:55,232
* Wants to give you Pennsylvania

1719
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:58,867
* Then you know you're
talking to the reefer man *
