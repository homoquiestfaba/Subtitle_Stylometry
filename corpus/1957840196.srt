00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,080
Alo

2
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,960
Marshid

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,840
This is Golbarg.

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Here, that's all I have.
-No no no. don't! Thanks!

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,880
I'll be here for awhile.

6
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,200
Just wasted our time.

7
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Hey Ahad..
How's it going?

8
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,720
They've sent Auntie
to the cemetery's morgue.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
Yeah

10
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
How am I supposed to know?

11
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,520
Her doctor already
signed the death certificate.

12
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,880
I'll see you there at the cemetery,
in the chamber. Don't be late, ok?

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,200
Alright, see you later.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,760
How's Ahad getting there?
- By subway.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,960
But it's an hour walk from
the station to the chamber.

16
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,160
There are cemetery cabs
right outside of the station.

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
And then..

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,960
as they say. He acted like..

19
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,720
What should we do now?
- Well, they're having lunch.

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,520
So we should wait
till they finish their lunch?

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
We're waiting for Ahad anyway.

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,880
Hello.
- Hi pal.

23
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,760
It seems like nobody's set foot
in here for decades. No?

24
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,360
Do you live abroad?
- Abroad?

25
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,160
No. Why?

26
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,680
What are you doing?

27
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,120
So why did you come to visit
your family only now?

28
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,240
But these are not my family.

29
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,440
Where are you going?
Where's the block 209?

30
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,240
It's 500 meter that way,
after the children's block.

31
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
I can't believe this!

32
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,640
They're still in there
not even bothering about us.

33
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,640
They're having a picnic.

34
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't know
where the hell Ahad is.

35
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,400
Saba, go say something to them.
- No I won't!

36
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,360
You're so useless, always
glued to your phone.

37
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,000
Excuse me gentlemen!
But a little respect won't hurt!

38
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,120
You've been here for an hour
like you're having a picnic.

39
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,120
Where are your manners?
Our family is buried here.

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Reserved

41
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Hi there!

42
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
How's it going?

43
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,360
No, not at all!

44
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
I've never dealt with
such an idiot client!

45
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,680
I keep telling him..

46
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,880
..that they don't have the stones
he wanted for the facade anymore.

47
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,040
He just doesn't listen!

48
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
He's one of those types
that a couple of years ago..

49
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,800
..would've had two marble
lions at the entrance.

50
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,320
- Morad gave the key to strangers.
I’ve no idea what's going on here.

51
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,720
What the hell Ahad!

52
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,560
- I'll call you later.

53
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,920
Have you lost your mind?
- I'm just trying my eternal bed!

54
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
Get up now! Get up you idiot!

55
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,360
Mr. Morad was supposed to
take care of this place,

56
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
But he hasn't done anything.

57
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
What was your name again?
- Bagheri.

58
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,120
No, your first name.
- Hassan.

59
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,760
Hassan dear, take this money
and do me a favor

60
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,600
Get some nice flowers and plants
- Okay

61
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
Keep the change for yourself.

62
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,920
- Mom, why did you send that poor guy
We could've just driven there.

63
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,600
Then take the car and go with him!

64
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,160
Yes, thank you, I appreciate it.

65
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,400
My brother and I are
her only family here.

66
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,520
Correct.

67
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,160
No, she did not have any children.

68
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,920
Correct.

69
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,920
Thank you very much!
I will contact you later.

70
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,080
They've brought Auntie
to the morgue.

71
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,080
We have to be there in 20 minutes.

72
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,200
Thank you so much Hassan!
- You're welcome Ma'am.

73
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,960
Saba help him.
- Let me take these.

74
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Oops! be careful. Put
the rest in that corner.

75
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,040
Have you brought anything
to clean the chamber?

76
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,800
Yes Ma'am.

77
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,480
You bought such beautiful flowers.

78
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,640
Excuse me Sir,
which way is the morgue?

79
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,080
- First you should
go to the cemetery office.

80
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,360
It's behind that building.

81
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,960
He says we should
go to the cemetery office.

82
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,120
Oh it's so hot today!

83
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,760
We went to see Auntie.

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
I think Golbarg had
put make up on her.

85
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,000
- Do they let her have
makeup on?

86
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
They'll remove it before the burial.

87
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,760
Who's Golbarg?
- Her caregiver.

88
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
Don't you even know this?

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
What will happen to her?
- How should I know?

90
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,840
She'll probably
go back to her town.

91
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,960
Although, she'll be there
till the end of the funeral.

92
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Besides, there are tons of
jobs for a nurse like her?

93
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,800
Hassan dear, do
you know Mr Morad?

94
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Doesn't he work here anymore?
- Morad's dead.

95
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
What? Morad died?
- Yes Ma'am.

96
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,280
When?

97
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,280
I don't know, 2 months, 3
months, or 4 months ago.

98
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,040
I was here 3 months ago.
He was all fine and healthy.

99
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,040
How did he die?
- His heart stopped.

100
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Shame!

101
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,360
They buried him there
in the new blocks.

102
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,200
Mahshid, I don't have any cash
on me. Can you give me some?

103
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,880
Thank you.

104
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,720
Well done Hassan!
- Thank you!

105
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,920
Sorry it's not much.
- Thank you very much Sir!

106
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,360
You worked very hard today.
You can leave now. Thank you.

107
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,800
Thank you very much
for your hard work Hassan.

108
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,280
So, we have one free spot
next to Dad's grave.

109
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,880
And there's one other spot
next to Shahram's.

110
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,560
Next to Shahram is my plot and
the one next to Dad was Mom's.

111
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,760
Well, Grandma obviously
doesn't need it anymore.

112
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,360
Mansour bought it
for him and Fariba.

113
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,640
He has turned it into a double plot.
- Why did nobody tell me?

114
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,200
You know Mom never
wanted to be buried here.

115
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,280
She herself sold her grave
when she was still alive.

116
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,960
Let's just put her in my plot then.
- So, that our family’s only son..

117
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,800
..will not be buried here.
Besides, who's gonna pay for it?

118
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,320
What difference does it make?
It's ours.

119
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,240
So, we just give away our graves
and nobody else spends a penny.

120
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,000
Besides, our father wanted his
only son to be buried by his side.

121
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,280
Listen, we have to spend a fortune
to buy a grave anywhere else.

122
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,360
Which one of these
are double depth plots?

123
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,600
That one is Tooraj's grave,
and Ferri lies on top of him.

124
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
Here, Vakili's.
- No. That's Azar's spot.

125
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
Auntie Azar won't even
come for the funeral.

126
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,680
So what?
- So how'd she ever find out?

127
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,160
Vakili's been dead for a long time.
We can bury Auntie in his place.

128
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,280
Vakili hasn't been
dead for that long!

129
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,600
Mom!

130
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,720
I was in second
grade when he died.

131
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,600
She's right!
Vakili's been dead for 25 years!

132
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,400
Legally,
30 years should pass to replace it.

133
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,120
Say 5 years. Azar will kill us!

134
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,000
This is their plot.
We can't just take it from them.

135
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,720
I don't know anymore.

136
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,080
Then, we don't have
any place for Auntie Parvin.

137
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,680
We can put her next to Mom.
- Say again?

138
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,720
We bury Auntie next to Mom.
- That area is too expensive.

139
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,360
Is anything available up there?
- Yes, we can find something.

140
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,000
How much are they?
- From 80 to 200 million Toman.

141
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Wow! How much? 80 million?
- It depends on its location Madam.

142
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,120
My goodness!

143
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,000
What's up?

144
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,920
This asshole has sued us.

145
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,920
He hasn't even paid us
since last year.

146
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,400
No, the contractor has also
told him about the stones.

147
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,920
- Want a grave? I'll give
you a good price.

148
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,760
Listen, legally he can sue us.

149
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,720
His claim is that we took
too long or something.

150
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,080
Yeah

151
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,760
So, what's the deal?
- I don't know.

152
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,360
Listen Ahad, I really prefer to put
Auntie next to Mom.

153
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,320
There are some available
graves up there, right?

154
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,760
- These are all either
occupied or have owners.

155
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,280
There are some sellers
among them.

156
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,320
Since the prices have gone up..

157
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,960
.. they replace the older graves
with triple depth plots.

158
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,120
You can have my number for now.

159
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,320
Anyway, this area's too expensive.

160
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,200
Azar can also chip in.
She was her aunt too.

161
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,560
Look, I'd like to put her
next to Mom too.

162
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,720
But you and I will end up
paying for the whole thing.

163
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,600
And you know Azar
never does anyone a favor

164
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,400
But this place is so humiliating!
What will people say?

165
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,400
Those looked a bit better.
How much are those?

166
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,240
From 3 to 6 million Toman.
They're all triple depth.

167
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I won't let our aunt
to be buried here.

168
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,600
Let me call Azar.

169
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,760
This area will rapidly get filled.

170
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Then everybody
will want to be buried here.

171
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,840
Ahad, you owe Azar money?
- Yeah, why?

172
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,600
You made me humiliate myself
in front of her.

173
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,960
Why did you borrow money from her?
- I'll tell you later.

174
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,640
What are we supposed to do now?

175
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,360
Let's just put her in my grave.
Dad will actually enjoy it.

176
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,360
You cut it out now!
Everything's just a joke to you.

177
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,640
You can either call or go online
to reserve one of these.

178
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,240
They each cost 1.5 million Toman.
They are all triple depth plots.

179
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,920
If you'd rather not buy a plot,
you can bury her here for free.

180
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,440
The cemetery will then bury other
people on top of her.
