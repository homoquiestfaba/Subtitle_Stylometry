1
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,870
You ever fart and sneeze
at the same time?

2
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,464
You ever barf up something
you know you didn't eat?

3
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,772
I got sick one time
and barfed a whole shrimp.

4
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,107
I mean, I know I chewed it.

5
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,407
I got a better one.

6
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,778
Once, I barfed so hard

7
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,976
that I pulled a string bean
out of my nose.

8
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,342
That was gross.

9
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,786
Oh, that's so slimy.

10
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,948
Ew.

11
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,925
You know when you just
wake up, and you're sick,

12
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,824
and you're just waiting
to suck it down.

13
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,489
Aw, man you could hawk one
of those ten feet, easy.

14
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,965
No, no, no... it's better
to blow them out your nose.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,968
No, no, it's better to suck.

16
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,129
Now, those are not
the best loogies.

17
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,866
My cousin hawked a loogie

18
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,771
from the top of the
Empire State Building.

19
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,776
Hit a lady in the head.
Killed her.

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,902
He's in prison now.

21
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,775
In prison for snot.

22
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,005
Boom, boom.

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,977
Okay, you guys, come on.

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,713
We place here
in the time capsule...

25
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,346
The sacred shoe box.

26
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:34,452
Okay, in the sacred shoe box,

27
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,123
the things we do not understand,

28
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,463
to be opened again when all
the mysteries of the universe

29
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,992
have been revealed to us.

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,970
Who's first? Kevin.

31
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:57,439
I found it in my mom's secret
drawer, in this plastic box.

32
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,580
I know what this is.

33
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,218
It goes in the bottom of
the bathtub to stop the drain.

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,750
No, it doesn't.
It's a diaphragm.

35
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,195
It prevents the passage
of sperm into the uterus...

36
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,528
in girls.

37
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,964
How do you know that?

38
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,331
I saw it on Nightline.

39
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,529
I'm telling you, Frank,

40
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,470
it goes in the bottom
of the bathtub.

41
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,974
I think it's
a travel drinking cup.

42
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,203
She'll never miss it.

43
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,735
Wait, don't drink out of it
until we know what it is.

44
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,713
Yeah.

45
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,272
Brad.

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,315
I found it in my sister's room.

47
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,849
I believe it's
some kind of weapon.

48
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,593
A picture of my dead mother.

49
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,395
How come you're
putting it in the box?

50
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,425
Because I don't know why
my dad keeps all of her pictures

51
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,906
hidden in the attic, and tells
me she looked like Grace Kelley.

52
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,706
Who's Grace Kelley?

53
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,007
Oh, she was a very famous clown.

54
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,739
She was a princess.

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,272
And, also...

56
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,945
I don't know what
it's like to have a mother.

57
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,112
We could tell you.

58
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:13,057
You can't tell somebody
something like that.

59
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,295
Have you ever noticed
that girls don't fart?

60
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,530
My mom farts.

61
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,072
Looks like a boob.

62
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:31,202
Yeah.
Make them fly around.

63
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,972
My boob's bigger than yours.

64
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,983
Let's see if you can
catch my boob.

65
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,951
You've got, like,
a mosquito bite boob, Frank.

66
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,454
Why don't girls spit?

67
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,513
They're hiding
something from us.

68
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,650
The rules have changed.

69
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,853
Gotcha.

70
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,885
It's a battle of the sexes...

71
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:54,457
and believe me,
we are way behind.

72
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,984
Shit!

73
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,656
I can't dance.

74
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,037
You see this, Frank?

75
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,545
This little seedling

76
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,571
represents an entire species
of marsh grass.

77
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,312
If it lives,
the wetlands will survive,

78
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,822
Mortlake turtle can return
to its natural habitat,

79
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,380
and birds like the glossy ibis

80
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,518
won't lose another
precious nesting place.

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,796
Dad, if you don't get dressed,
we'll be late for school.

82
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:35,756
Dad, if you don't get dressed,
we'll be late for school.

83
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,895
Hey, hey, look at this.

84
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:41,594
You won a prize.

85
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,767
Yeah.

86
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,506
What is that?

87
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,242
Homework.

88
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,750
They're assigning Cosmopolitan
as homework?

89
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:54,752
No, they assigned this,

90
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,185
but I'm getting nowhere with it.

91
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,984
You can't relate that
to the real world.

92
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,351
Like how?

93
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:02,656
Like, was Mom a virgin
when you married her?

94
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,355
What are you studying, religion?

95
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,363
Sex.

96
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,796
Are you going to tell me
about Mom or not?

97
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:08,527
No.

98
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,660
Boy, that's good coffee.
Fresh brewed?

99
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:11,930
Instant.

100
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:13,834
Now, how 'bout
if you love someone?

101
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,635
Do you have to have sex
with them?

102
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:16,868
This can't be instant.

103
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,341
We ran out of beans.

104
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:19,468
And if you kiss a girl,

105
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,035
what base is that,

106
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,411
and where's the birth canal?

107
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,574
I have a chart.

108
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,948
You never have to have sex
if you don't want to,

109
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:29,145
kissing a girl's first base,
the birth canal's right there,

110
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,245
and you shouldn't have sex

111
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,949
unless you're in love
and probably married.

112
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,957
Why not?

113
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:34,424
I don't remember--
it has something to do

114
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,451
with not wanting to have babies
with people you don't know.

115
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,053
It says in this magazine

116
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,395
that there's a spot on
a woman you can touch

117
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,401
to drive her completely insane.

118
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,933
I don't think
the magazine's a good idea.

119
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,965
And in my experience,
there is no such place.

120
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:51,976
Dad.

121
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,238
What?

122
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:57,578
When I grow up, do I have
to have hair all over my body?

123
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:59,948
You saw your sister
naked in the shower?

124
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:01,179
Sort of.

125
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:03,779
I was hiding
in the laundry basket.

126
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,414
Hey, Stacey.

127
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,618
Hi, Brad.

128
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,820
I saw you in
the drug store yesterday.

129
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,761
You were buying Juicy Fruit gum.

130
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,263
Are you going to
the dance Saturday?

131
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,459
It's a '50s sock hop,
you know.

132
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,434
I'm thinking of going
to the dance.

133
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,662
Can I wear
your jacket today, Brad?

134
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,337
Oh, come on,
what do you want for it?

135
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:34,151
I want to take you
to the closet...

136
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:35,777
No way!

137
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,685
You are so bad.

138
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:40,649
What'd you say to her?

139
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:42,956
I told her what I wanted.

140
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,325
I don't think
she's that kind of girl.

141
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:45,351
She's a girl, Frank.

142
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:47,365
All girls are
that kind of girl.

143
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,959
She didn't used to be a girl.

144
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,969
Hey, guys.

145
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,506
What are we looking at?

146
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:09,985
What's that?

147
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,150
I think it's an elbow.

148
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:18,958
What's it doing
with that other elbow?

149
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,528
Doesn't look like anything

150
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,799
I ever want to do,
that's for sure.

151
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,037
Will you stop cleaning?
Why do you do that?

152
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,806
My dad demands complete
order and sanitation.

153
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:39,946
I know a place where the girls
are naked all the time,

154
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:45,751
where guys can see naked girls
all they want, 24 hours a day

155
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,726
for anyone with guts
and a hundred bucks.

156
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,626
I don't believe
such a place exists.

157
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,961
Where is this?
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,124
The city.

159
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,135
We're not allowed
to go to the city.

160
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,602
In the city
there are no rules.

161
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:01,298
Everything is possible,

162
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,899
and everything is available
for a price.

163
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,637
Lucky for us,
our needs are small.

164
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:09,146
What are our needs?

165
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,049
T o see a woman naked.

166
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:56,153
Let me see the money.

167
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:57,320
Come on, let me see the money.

168
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:58,795
The money.

169
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,559
Let me see the money.

170
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:01,758
The money.

171
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,374
Keep it moving.

172
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,541
Come on, come on,
give me the money.

173
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,743
All right, come on.

174
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:20,944
Keep it running smoothly.

175
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,452
Looks beautiful on you.

176
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,114
Give me the money.
Thank you.

177
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:25,986
That sure is a lot
of milk money.

178
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:26,991
Kevin, some things

179
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,220
are more important
than milk, all right?

180
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,491
Well, what do you need
all this money for, anyway?

181
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,827
Oh, we're going
to buy a pros...

182
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,261
...thetic leg.

183
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,700
For his dog.

184
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:39,669
His dog lost his leg.

185
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:54,412
So, what'd you tell your dad?

186
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:55,976
I said I was eating
at Kevin's house.

187
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,419
I said I was eating
at Brad's house.

188
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,616
I said I was eating
at Frank's house.

189
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:01,022
Whoo, yeah!

190
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:02,616
You think the city's big.

191
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,684
It's huge!

192
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,958
And lots of naked ladies.

193
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:09,958
If I had my own naked lady,
I'd never leave my room.

194
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:12,832
If you had your own naked lady,
I'd never leave your room.

195
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,566
So, hold on--
do you got the money?

196
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:16,699
We got everything!

197
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,005
Whoo!

198
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:49,903
Whoa...

199
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,374
Whoa...

200
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,377
Oh, no.

201
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:02,649
I want to go back.

202
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:15,499
Hey, the footpath's for virgins.

203
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,091
We are virgins!

204
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,864
Hey, not for long.

205
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,133
If you guys get killed,
I'm going home.

206
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:29,970
Beautiful.

207
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,890
Oh, my God.

208
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:40,982
Do you believe this?

209
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,253
This woman

210
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:44,193
gave birth to her own head,

211
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,959
and it sang to her.

212
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:51,628
-Wow.
-Wow.

213
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,135
Hey, Cash, where you going?

214
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,870
You don't ask me that.

215
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,605
Never ask me that!

216
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,170
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just forgot for a second.

217
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:10,313
Guys, come here.

218
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,062
Whoa!

219
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,986
This is going to be
tougher than we thought.

220
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:48,584
How do we tell a prostitute
from everybody else?

221
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,152
Yeah, how do we know
we're not asking a ballerina,

222
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,994
or a lawyer, or a math teacher
to take off her clothes?

223
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,193
We just got
to go for it.

224
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,600
Frank, I think
I need to see the money.

225
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,938
Excuse me, miss,
do you have a minute?

226
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,073
Uh, ma'am?

227
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,373
Get out of my way.

228
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:15,286
Excuse me.

229
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,287
Yes?

230
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,346
Are you a prostitute?

231
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,516
What?

232
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,493
Will you take your clothes off
for $103.62?

233
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,430
Thanks, Kevin.

234
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,435
What? What'd I do?

235
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,875
-You all right?
-No.

236
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,937
Psst, psst, psst. Guys...

237
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,480
You guys need some help?

238
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,815
Are you talking to us?

239
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,820
Yeah.

240
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,287
We want to see a naked lady.

241
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,755
Ooh, how much money you got?

242
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,816
$103.62.

243
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,384
Really?

244
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,022
That'll do it.
Come on.

245
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,905
Right through here.
Come on, come on, come on.

246
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,550
Where?

247
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,454
There are naked women in here?

248
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:35,893
Guys, you got to trust me.

249
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,095
Why should we trust you?

250
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,001
Because I got a gun.

251
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,345
Okay, open up, big boy.

252
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,371
Mmm.

253
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:54,983
Mmm.

254
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:56,485
Okay, backpacks.

255
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,148
Come on, do it.
Do it now!

256
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,349
I'm full, I'm full.

257
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,191
He's got a gun.

258
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,787
Get down, get down.

259
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,195
Stay down.

260
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,699
Stay.

261
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,495
Stay.

262
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,572
You okay?

263
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,475
Yeah.

264
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:25,978
Get us out of here!

265
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,154
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

266
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:31,985
Wait a minute!
Son of a bitch!

267
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,720
I want my money!

268
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,319
Oh, goddamn it!

269
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,492
You all right?

270
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,763
Yeah.

271
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,374
How am I going to get home?

272
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,742
I'm going to get in such trouble
for this.

273
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,247
Us, too.

274
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,340
Shit.

275
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,749
Well, I'm out of here.

276
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:02,116
You better go.

277
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,429
Do you need any help, ma'am?

278
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,066
Ma'am?

279
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,407
No, thanks.

280
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,639
You sure you don't need
something?

281
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,808
I need 100 bucks,
or I'm going to get smacked.

282
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,943
You got that?

283
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,679
Yes, I do.

284
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,382
You can have it.
You saved my life.

285
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,855
What are you doing
with all that money?

286
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,191
We wanted to see
a naked lady.

287
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,662
Oh, God.

288
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,664
You know what?

289
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,757
Why don't you take
that money and go home,

290
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,131
before you get hurt, okay?

291
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:52,227
I-I wish I could, but...

292
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,969
it means a lot to my friends,
and we just want a look.

293
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,971
How much looking?

294
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,105
As much as money can buy.

295
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,646
Okay.

296
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:11,683
Thank you.

297
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:12,916
Mm-hmm.

298
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:15,425
Okay, pull your shirts up
over your heads.

299
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,694
You first.

300
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,858
Show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.

301
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,424
Our what?

302
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:26,095
Armpits, come on.

303
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,401
Come on.

304
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:37,437
Okay, you're not hairy enough
to be dangerous.

305
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,850
We're not hairy at all.

306
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:43,854
So, what's your name, lady?

307
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:45,185
V.

308
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:46,951
Like the letter?

309
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:49,755
What's it stand for?

310
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:50,886
What's your name?

311
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:52,190
Kevin.

312
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:53,526
I'm Frank.

313
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:54,622
Brad.

314
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,084
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

315
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,092
Oh, God.

316
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,368
Come on, come in.

317
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:40,466
Excuse me.

318
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:53,346
What do we do now?

319
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,914
Just ask her to...
you know.

320
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,722
You kids see a lot of hookers?

321
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,389
No, this is our first one.

322
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,228
Why do you have

323
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,893
a picture of Grace Kelley?

324
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:05,265
'Cause I'd like to be like her:

325
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:06,735
Marry a prince
and never get old.

326
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,603
When you take your clothes off
for money, do you get cold?

327
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,369
Depends on the room.

328
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:13,968
I have this dream
that I'm naked at school,

329
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,979
and I have to get home
without anyone seeing me.

330
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:18,878
I have that dream, too.

331
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,816
Last time I had that dream,

332
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:23,251
there was an alligator
chasing me.

333
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:24,652
You ever get that one?

334
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:25,655
Nope.

335
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:26,986
Do you ever watch cartoons?

336
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:27,819
Yes.

337
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:28,790
Are you married?

338
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,158
Boy, you ask a lot of questions.

339
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,357
The meter's ticking.

340
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,165
She's on the bed.
She's on the bed!

341
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,829
Now, how do you
want to do this:

342
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,235
standing up or on the bed?

343
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:42,330
I'll stand.

344
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,637
I meant me, not you.

345
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,370
-On the bed.
-On the bed.

346
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:48,378
On the bed.

347
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:49,777
Bed.

348
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,338
Okay. Come here.

349
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,792
Do you want the lights
on or off?

350
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:10,658
Is she naked yet?

351
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,601
Don't start until I can see.

352
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:15,230
You turned off the lights.
We can't see.

353
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:18,434
All set?

354
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:37,687
What's the matter?

355
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:40,162
-I can't do it.
-I want to be a gentleman.

356
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:43,655
Doesn't a gentleman bring enough
for everybody?

357
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,104
This is the greatest moment
of my life.

358
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:56,470
Okay, that's it. Time's up.

359
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:58,981
Any questions?

360
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:02,579
After sex, you smoke.

361
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,814
It's a rule.

362
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:06,584
Anybody have any matches?

363
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:10,151
-No.
-No.

364
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:14,223
I feel it now. We're different.

365
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:15,959
How?

366
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:18,432
We're men.

367
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,537
Yeah.
Men without bikes.

368
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,409
Oh, boy.

369
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:45,994
Waltzer, Waltzer, look,
don't worry.

370
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,362
Your cut's waiting for you,
that's right.

371
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,562
Relax. Relax.

372
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:53,763
Look, I tell you what...

373
00:22:55,305 --> 00:22:56,272
-Ow!
-Right.

374
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:58,934
Look, if you don't get all
of your dough,

375
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:00,068
feel free to kill me.

376
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:11,077
What do I look like, huh?

377
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,783
A Laundromat?

378
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:15,724
A slot machine?

379
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,322
'Cause I am not a slot machine.

380
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:19,761
You are a slot machine.

381
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:21,822
Step right up here, folks,
there's a winner every minute.

382
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,856
Sorry.

383
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,227
Oh, what,
l-I hurt your feelings?

384
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:28,238
No.

385
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:29,603
No, and you want to know why?

386
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,131
'Cause you don't got
no feelings.

387
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:33,143
Yes, I do.

388
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:35,975
I'm a person,
and I have feelings.

389
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,571
Oh, ho, you're a person now.

390
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:43,079
Hey, she's not a person,
is she, Betty?

391
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
Yeah, she sort of is.

392
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:46,784
Nobody's talking to you.

393
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:50,155
You know what
the test is, baby?

394
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:51,388
If you were a person,

395
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:53,328
you could do
whatever you want...

396
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:54,330
Ow.

397
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:55,661
and you can't,

398
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:58,361
'cause you do whatever
I tell you to do,

399
00:23:58,402 --> 00:23:59,767
isn't that right, Betty?

400
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:02,135
Y eah.

401
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:05,141
I, on the other hand,
am a person.

402
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:06,574
I do what I want.
I take what I want.

403
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,544
I don't have to answer
to nobody.

404
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,479
Everybody answers to somebody.

405
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:11,845
You answer to Waltzer,

406
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:13,941
Waltzer answers
to Jerry the Pope.

407
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:16,451
Oh, oh, you think so, huh?

408
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:17,954
Yeah.

409
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,114
Waltzer steals from Jerry,
I steal from Waltzer.

410
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:21,681
They think that this
is their turf,

411
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:22,749
but they're wrong.

412
00:24:22,793 --> 00:24:23,851
This all belongs to me.

413
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:24,952
I'm the man.

414
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:27,895
Yeah... you're the man, Cash.

415
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:29,899
Yeah, that's right.

416
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:37,572
Yeah, and the man's got
to go out.

417
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:43,305
Don't neither of yous two move
until I get back.

418
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:51,853
I am a person.
I'm a human being.

419
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:53,049
Yeah.

420
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:12,039
T ell the asshole
I'm borrowing his car.

421
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,838
Hey, you can't do that, V.

422
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:16,038
Oh, yes, I can.

423
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:27,049
Didn't your mothers tell you
not to play in the rain?

424
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:55,442
Bye. Thanks.

425
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:56,453
Thank you.

426
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:59,923
See you guys.

427
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,529
This is where you live?

428
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,160
Yep. The yellow house
over there.

429
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,432
Do you like it?

430
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,735
Yeah, it's okay.

431
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,618
It was nice meeting you.

432
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:35,557
Likewise.

433
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,823
You're a very well-behaved
young man, you know.

434
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:39,055
Thanks.

435
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:41,690
All right.

436
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:43,256
Veronica.

437
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:46,429
Virginia?

438
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,960
West Virginia?

439
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:50,768
Good-bye.

440
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:57,337
I never really looked,
you know.

441
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:58,871
I didn't see anything.

442
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,798
That was funny.

443
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,036
Dad!

444
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:31,707
Hey!

445
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:35,207
Looks like TV.

446
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:58,467
Can I use your phone?

447
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:02,906
The phone's over here.

448
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:04,480
Where are your parents?

449
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:05,743
I only have one.

450
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:06,909
A father.

451
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:08,211
He's in the T onapiya
Wetlands.

452
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:09,480
What's that?

453
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,852
Well, this was all once
the T onapiya Wetlands.

454
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:14,790
He's trying to save
the last five acres,

455
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,122
but he won't.

456
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,127
Why?

457
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:18,753
No money.

458
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:21,492
He teaches science by day,
and, I don't know,

459
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,693
tries to save the wetlands
by night.

460
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,793
I admire him,
but I pity him, too.

461
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,428
You pity him?

462
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:30,338
Well, yeah,
his goals aren't realistic.

463
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:33,235
That's him.

464
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:34,710
Wait a minute...

465
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:36,474
maybe he shouldn't find me here,
you know?

466
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:40,108
Why not?
He's seen grown-ups before.

467
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,447
Hey, Dad.

468
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:43,146
Hey, Frank.

469
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:45,915
Dad, look.

470
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:47,287
Over there.

471
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:48,791
It's a girl.

472
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:51,454
I know.

473
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:53,656
What do you say?

474
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:54,857
Thank you?

475
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:55,990
T o her, to her.

476
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,764
Dad, this is V.

477
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,671
V, this is Dad.

478
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:06,170
Hello.

479
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,011
Hello... Dad.

480
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:21,354
What's she doing here?

481
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,620
Her car broke down.

482
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:24,092
Yeah, but who is she?

483
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:25,823
She's, uh...

484
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:27,694
she's Brad's new math tutor.

485
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:30,632
She gave me a ride home
from his house,

486
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,067
and then her car
wouldn't start.

487
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:41,406
You know what it is?

488
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,242
Well, it's not the starter.

489
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:45,615
T om.

490
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:46,616
Larry.

491
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,617
Wow.

492
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:50,085
So, Frank was telling me
what you do.

493
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,280
Really?

494
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:53,881
Yeah. Do you enjoy it?

495
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:55,949
Enjoy it?

496
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:58,625
Sometimes.

497
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:00,391
Yeah, you get to move around,

498
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,490
change of scenery,
meet new people.

499
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:03,557
Well...

500
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,124
I never thought of it
that way.

501
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:06,932
You seem like
a real people person.

502
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,164
Oh.

503
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:09,866
Outgoing. Not like me.

504
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:12,671
No?

505
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,074
Thanks.

506
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,807
I bet you're really good at it.

507
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,375
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

508
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:23,511
Boy, am I glad
to hear you say that...

509
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:28,992
because it's the one subject
he's having trouble with.

510
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:31,119
You think you could fit him in?

511
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,355
"Him?"

512
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:34,387
Frank.

513
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:37,400
Frank? Are you kidding?

514
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:38,867
At his age?

515
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:39,960
Well, I'm afraid

516
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:41,231
if he doesn't learn it now,

517
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:42,329
he's never going to.

518
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:43,964
You know, I would
teach him myself,

519
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:45,304
but I'm way out of practice.

520
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:46,502
Ah!

521
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:49,307
Oh. Um...

522
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:51,712
You know, you should
never have to practice.

523
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:53,807
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

524
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,284
You're a professional.

525
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,718
But for us laymen,

526
00:30:56,753 --> 00:30:59,347
if you don't use it,
you lose it.

527
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,721
Well, how long has it been,

528
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:04,522
you know, since you... used it?

529
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:08,622
Oh... I use it a little bit
every day, you know--

530
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:09,859
the bank,
the grocery store--

531
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,867
but it, you know...

532
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:13,699
It's probably been
a good ten, 15 years

533
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:16,399
since I was any good at it,
you know.

534
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,635
It doesn't come up that often.

535
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:24,476
Maybe it's the neighborhood.

536
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:26,808
T om.

537
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,010
-Larry.
-Wow.

538
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:31,913
Well, it's not the battery.

539
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:37,922
In the morning, I'll check
the fuel line for you,

540
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,360
the alternator, the pump.

541
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:40,590
You know, it could be

542
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:42,326
your plugs are worn down.

543
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:45,096
I'll replace them for you
in the morning.

544
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:46,659
In the meantime, uh...

545
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:48,432
could I give you
a ride home?

546
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:50,804
Um, no, I can walk.

547
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,543
So, what do you think?

548
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:02,208
Can you help him?

549
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:05,085
I'd much rather
do something for you.

550
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,613
Well, what could you do for me?

551
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:10,058
Well, it seems
like you've forgotten

552
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:11,617
just about everything.

553
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:15,962
Well, I remember the basics...
but it's...

554
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:17,693
I'm not concerned about myself.

555
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:18,962
It's Frank I'm worried about.

556
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,435
You know, it's just not
that important to me anymore.

557
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:26,466
Poor man.

558
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:13,684
Look at that woman.

559
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:14,918
Oh, my God.

560
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,755
Her top is so low.

561
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:19,956
And her skirt is so high.

562
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:21,792
That is bad.

563
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:25,825
It is.
It's very, very bad.

564
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,208
Are you, uh...

565
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:33,937
what I think you are?

566
00:33:33,977 --> 00:33:36,468
Well, I'm not
the public health nurse.

567
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:38,242
Would you... Iike some company?

568
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:39,339
Yes, I would.

569
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,509
Hi.

570
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,676
Hi, Andy.

571
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:42,980
Hi, boss.

572
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,112
Hi.

573
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:46,122
Did you hear that?

574
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:47,384
That was bad.

575
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:49,824
That was very, very bad.

576
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:52,721
Want a date?

577
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,625
I don't think
that's going to work.

578
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,294
That's Reverend Whitehead.

579
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,462
God doesn't let him do that.

580
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:02,028
Got you an ice cream.

581
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:03,903
Being on the job
probably makes you hungry.

582
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,907
Thanks.

583
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:05,908
What are you doing here?

584
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:06,909
Looking for you.

585
00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:08,570
Where are you going
to sleep tonight?

586
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:11,809
In a hotel, if you'll get lost
and let me make some money.

587
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:14,612
I-I don't think
you should be doing this.

588
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:17,279
What are you,
some kind of child missionary?

589
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,651
Sort of.

590
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,487
I did have an idea
about the sleeping thing.

591
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,483
Hi, Frank.

592
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:26,155
She spoke to me.

593
00:34:26,196 --> 00:34:29,427
I speak to her,
but she never speaks to me.

594
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:32,401
Hey, Frank, going to the dance?

595
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,802
I-I can't dance.

596
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:36,362
Me, neither.

597
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:39,807
Aren't you going to introduce us
to your friend, Frank?

598
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:45,971
I'm Frank's father's sister,
Aunt V,

599
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,711
and Frank and I are
very, very close,

600
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:48,809
aren't we, Frank?

601
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:51,954
We've got to be going now.

602
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:53,353
See you later.

603
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:59,227
Look at the way she walks.

604
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:00,593
That is bad.

605
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,565
That is very, very bad.

606
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:17,610
Are you running away?

607
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:19,740
No. What are you doing?

608
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:22,581
I'm organizing the fund-raiser.

609
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,813
Again?

610
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:25,481
There's only two more weeks

611
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,956
before they bulldoze
my five acres.

612
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:30,015
Who will you invite?

613
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:33,423
I don't know.

614
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:36,931
Thanks, pal.

615
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:40,827
Frank.

616
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:42,133
You know G?

617
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:43,400
G?

618
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,135
The math tutor.

619
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:46,972
Yeah.

620
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:49,204
She's a Grace Kelly, isn't she?

621
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:51,976
Yeah.

622
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:27,474
Light, reading material...

623
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:28,745
Hey.

624
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,776
dinner with everything...

625
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:35,618
Oh, great. Thanks.

626
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:37,627
Pajamas.

627
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:38,958
Okay.

628
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:40,587
Turn around.

629
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,222
Why?

630
00:36:42,265 --> 00:36:43,323
Because I'm going
to change,

631
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:44,765
and you don't have
any more money.

632
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:47,565
This is sweet.

633
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:48,969
It was my mom's.

634
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:51,303
Isn't she going
to miss it?

635
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:52,774
She died before I was born.

636
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:54,401
I don't think that's possible.

637
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:58,710
She died exactly when
I was born, to the minute.

638
00:36:58,748 --> 00:36:59,976
Oh, I'm sorry.

639
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:02,143
You can
turn around now.

640
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:08,619
What's this?

641
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:10,853
Did some rich guy
give it to you?

642
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,759
Is it worth a million bucks?

643
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,058
No.

644
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:17,066
Oh, did your mom give it to you,
and then she died,

645
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,591
and that's all you have
to remember her by?

646
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:22,161
No. I stole it.

647
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:24,673
Oh.

648
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,471
T oo bad it's empty.

649
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:29,945
T oo bad you don't have a guy
to put in your locket.

650
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:32,504
A guy with a house,
a job, a car,

651
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,676
credit cards...

652
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:35,878
and a son.

653
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:38,353
Yeah, I know
what you're trying to do,

654
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:40,083
and it's not going to work.

655
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:41,954
Well, what am I trying to do?

656
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:44,324
You want me to go out
with your dad.

657
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:45,658
No, I don't.

658
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:46,923
That's good.

659
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:49,090
I want you to marry my dad.

660
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,196
Let me explain.

661
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:55,170
I never mix business
with pleasure.

662
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:56,866
I'm not talking about pleasure.

663
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,932
I'm talking
about you marrying my dad.

664
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:02,911
But people like your dad
don't marry women like me.

665
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:07,382
Well... I told him what you did,
and he didn't mind.

666
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:08,850
I told the truth.

667
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:11,285
Really?

668
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,522
I don't know.

669
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:16,787
I think the truth
kind of gets you in trouble.

670
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:19,925
You know what
you should do?

671
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,931
Find your dad one of those
nice women that we saw in town.

672
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,558
Nice women don't understand him.

673
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,932
I don't even understand him.

674
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:28,436
He spends all of his time
wading around in mud,

675
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,904
cataloging plants.

676
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:35,870
Good night. Use the can
if you need anything.

677
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:37,743
Can?

678
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:49,324
Looks like a boob.

679
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:59,428
Hello, V?

680
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:00,959
V.

681
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:04,837
V, this is Frank.

682
00:39:04,874 --> 00:39:07,672
From the can.

683
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:09,008
This is V.

684
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:13,411
My dad thinks you look
like Grace Kelly.

685
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,441
Good night.

686
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:21,346
Good night, Frank.

687
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:57,420
I'm telling you, she slept
in the tree house last night.

688
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,859
You're so full of shit.

689
00:39:58,895 --> 00:39:59,953
Oh, my God-- a "C."

690
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,724
My dad is going
to kill me.

691
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:03,062
What's wrong with a "C"?

692
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,930
Her car broke down
in front of my house.

693
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:05,957
She had to stay.

694
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:06,968
She's there right now.

695
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,527
She's going
to tell on us, I know.

696
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:09,538
She's not there.

697
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:10,971
I bet you a zillion
billion dollars

698
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,133
that you are full of shit.

699
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:13,142
You're on.

700
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:14,143
Name your price.

701
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:16,008
Your leather jacket.

702
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:21,074
Oh, thank God-- a "D."

703
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:22,982
-What?
-Oh, no, no,

704
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,850
I'd rather bet
a zillion billion dollars.

705
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:28,324
Look, if she's not at my house
after school,

706
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:30,588
I'll be your slave for life.

707
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:32,754
These are
excellent terms, Brad.

708
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:34,195
You're toast.

709
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,729
Oh, no.

710
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:42,729
He got an "F".

711
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:38,521
Your understanding of
the female reproductive cycle

712
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:40,552
is simply not satisfactory.

713
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:42,895
I'm giving you a second chance

714
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:45,560
by assigning an
oral presentation.

715
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:48,935
Oral-- as in from the mouth?

716
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:50,405
That's exactly right.

717
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,908
An oral presentation
on the material

718
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:57,106
with footnotes and visual aids,
due by the end of the week.

719
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:01,373
What kind of visual aids?

720
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,384
Well, Suzanne,

721
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:04,409
trash day
in the red light district

722
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:07,685
took on new meaning today
as one unlucky local resident

723
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:09,453
made a grisly discovery.

724
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:13,223
He found sitting innocently
among the trash cans at the curb

725
00:42:13,263 --> 00:42:15,959
the dead body
of an unidentified white male.

726
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:18,365
The body,
when examined by paramedics,

727
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:22,599
showed signs of what police are
calling ritualistic mutilation.

728
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,971
Oh, my God.

729
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:26,941
Oh, my God.

730
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:28,876
...or release
the name of the victim.

731
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:32,973
But speculation on the street
is that the killing was related

732
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,312
to drug running
and prostitution.

733
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:36,375
Millionaire importer

734
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:38,250
and reputed mob boss
Jerry the Pope

735
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:39,915
denied allegations that moneys

736
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:41,719
from local prostitution
operations

737
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:44,056
were being funneled
through his corporation.

738
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:48,663
Hello.

739
00:42:48,698 --> 00:42:49,722
Betty, it's V.

740
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:50,892
I'm just watching the news.

741
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:51,901
What happened?

742
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:55,462
Um... Cash stole from Waltzer,

743
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:58,406
so Waltzer cut his heart out.

744
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,405
Guess he wasn't a person
after all.

745
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:05,243
V, Cash said that

746
00:43:05,281 --> 00:43:07,078
you took the money.

747
00:43:08,518 --> 00:43:10,145
That's not true.

748
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:13,519
I, I believe you, but...

749
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:17,822
you got to tell Waltzer
in person.

750
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:24,331
Um...

751
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:26,927
T ell me where you are,

752
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,699
and I'll come to you.

753
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,132
V?

754
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:42,979
Got to...

755
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:44,815
Oh, shit.

756
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,457
Got to get out of here. Okay.

757
00:44:02,071 --> 00:44:04,062
Oh!

758
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,062
Excuse me.

759
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:33,227
Sorry, excuse me.

760
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:34,429
Thank you.

761
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,267
Who do I need to find?

762
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,705
What am I doing?

763
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,537
Uh, Dad. Dad.

764
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:41,702
Find Dad.

765
00:44:58,127 --> 00:44:59,185
Um, excuse me.

766
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:00,217
I'm looking

767
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,230
for Frank's father.

768
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:03,232
He's a teacher here.

769
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:05,666
Oh, what's his goddamn name?

770
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,862
His name is, um...

771
00:45:06,903 --> 00:45:08,734
T om.

772
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:11,262
T om, that's his name.

773
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,892
...the edges on the sedge.

774
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:40,527
That's one of the ways
you can tell--

775
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,696
sedges have edges.

776
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,831
Now, if you look at
the composition of this soil

777
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:46,103
closely under a microscope,
you could see traces of

778
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:48,167
thousands and thousands
of years of evolution.

779
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:49,303
Thanks, Mr. Wheeler.

780
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:50,334
You're welcome, Nate.

781
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,540
-Mr. Wheeler.
-Mm-hmm.

782
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:52,639
Is this toad flax?

783
00:45:52,682 --> 00:45:53,944
No, that's lmpatiens capensis.

784
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:55,450
That's also known
as touch-me-not.

785
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:57,214
You guys,
I found a touch-me-not.

786
00:45:57,253 --> 00:45:58,845
Untouched, unspoiled,

787
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:01,652
here in the middle
of suburban uniformity,

788
00:46:01,691 --> 00:46:06,856
you can find...
a tiny wilderness.

789
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:07,863
Dad.

790
00:46:07,897 --> 00:46:09,159
Brian, don't be an idiot.

791
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:11,325
Hey, Dad... whoa.

792
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:15,293
I need to talk to you

793
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:16,305
for a second.

794
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:18,204
I didn't know

795
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:19,765
he had a daughter.

796
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:21,834
I need you to fix my car.

797
00:46:21,878 --> 00:46:23,778
I was planning on
fixing that after school.

798
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:24,802
I can't wait that long.

799
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:25,939
I mean, I need to leave town.

800
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:27,640
I've got to get out
of here right now.

801
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:28,945
T ell me about it, lady.

802
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:30,508
We all want
to get out of here.

803
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:34,717
Are you late for an appointment
with a client?

804
00:46:37,193 --> 00:46:40,321
Are you a religious fanatic
or something?

805
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:43,696
No. Why?

806
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:44,825
Oh...

807
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,199
'cause you're just
the most understanding man

808
00:46:47,236 --> 00:46:48,726
I've ever met.

809
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:50,466
Thank you.

810
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:55,972
Wow, look at this place.

811
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:56,979
What is this?

812
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:59,743
This is the...
T anapaya Wet Lands.

813
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:01,545
What's left of it.

814
00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:04,212
This is the place that
you're trying to save?

815
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:05,618
Mm-hmm.

816
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:07,384
It's so beautiful.

817
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:09,254
You think so?

818
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:10,384
Yeah.

819
00:47:10,426 --> 00:47:12,485
Why would anybody
want to ruin this?

820
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:14,655
Well...

821
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:17,530
Look...

822
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:19,432
A glossy ibis.

823
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:26,904
I watch a lot of
documentaries on TV.

824
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:34,581
You know, maybe l
don't have to leave.

825
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:40,817
I mean, it's so safe here and
nobody knows about this place.

826
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,520
Except you and me.

827
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,758
Just you and me.

828
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:50,891
And the 20 of us.

829
00:47:52,668 --> 00:47:54,761
I'll be home by 4:00.

830
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:56,669
I could fix your car then.

831
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:58,173
Okay.

832
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,640
Can you manage on foot?

833
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:01,973
Yeah, I have this, this, um...

834
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:04,411
I have this old bike here.

835
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:07,314
Hey, hey, that's my bike.

836
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:09,712
Oh...

837
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:14,355
Bye.

838
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,388
It's her car. It's her car.

839
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,735
What are you doing?!

840
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,932
I'm taking a bath.

841
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,237
Why?

842
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,937
Well, because my boss
had his heart ripped out,

843
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,844
and some very bad people
are looking for me,

844
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,711
so I'm staying for a while.

845
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,512
I've seen The Brady Bunch,

846
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,145
nothing bad ever happens
to you people.

847
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,313
I told you.

848
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,220
You got to get rid of her,
she'll tell our parents.

849
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,383
If my dad finds out,
I am dead.

850
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,756
They don't even know
I lost my bike.

851
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:50,782
You guys, relax.

852
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:51,816
She's not going to tell.

853
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:52,829
She's my friend.

854
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,353
She's going to marry my dad.

855
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,956
Marry her? Marry her?

856
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,193
He can't marry her.

857
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,361
No one can marry her,
'cause when people get married

858
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,563
they tell everything.

859
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,003
She'll tell, she'll tell.

860
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,028
They all tell.

861
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,870
Kevin, listen to me.

862
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:07,843
If she tells,
we'll all say it's Frank.

863
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,204
Fine.

864
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:13,838
Brad.

865
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,312
You're wearing my jacket.

866
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,456
I thought we bet
a billion zillion dollars.

867
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:27,886
We need to get
a few things straight.

868
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,668
Dad won't be home
till 4:00-- relax.

869
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:33,727
Look, here's the deal.

870
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,203
You can stay in my tree fort

871
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,934
and you can play in the house
only when Dad's at work.

872
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,030
No smoking,

873
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,704
no swearing, and no
letting Dad know

874
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,212
you're staying here.

875
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,612
And don't take
your clothes off for money.

876
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,308
Anything else?

877
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,050
Yeah, I need some help
with my homework.

878
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,550
What's the subject?

879
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,961
How long do you want me to wait?

880
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,658
Until you're more mature, Frank.

881
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,963
A sexual relationship
with a woman

882
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,230
is a very, very precious thing.

883
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,170
I was talking about dinner.

884
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,195
It's getting cold.

885
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,676
Oh... I knew that.

886
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,504
You ready?

887
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:17,513
Yeah.

888
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,539
Ready, set, go.

889
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:49,703
Ah, beat you.

890
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,318
Who was a faster eater,
you or Mom?

891
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,455
We never raced.

892
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,260
What kind of microwave
dinners did she like?

893
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,196
We cooked real food.

894
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,722
You miss real food?

895
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:13,327
How can l?
I've never eaten it.

896
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,820
All right, everybody,
I want you to sit down.

897
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,380
Okay, come on.

898
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,120
Let's get started. Time.

899
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,491
Sit down.

900
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,967
Do you believe he comes
to school with it on?

901
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,935
Frank, are you ready
to begin your report?

902
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,442
No, not yet.

903
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,578
Owen Meany Junior High.

904
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,848
Just a moment.

905
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,315
Miss Fetch,

906
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,383
please report to the office.

907
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,224
You have a phone call.

908
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:13,786
All right.

909
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,889
Frank, don't do anything
until I get back.

910
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,524
Of course.

911
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,536
Let's get started.

912
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,636
On what?

913
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,704
Started on what?

914
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,498
Hello.

915
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:03,538
Hello? Hello?

916
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,540
The line is dead.

917
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,382
This.. is a woman.

918
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,382
These... are her breasts.

919
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,720
They serve an important

920
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,855
biological function
in child-rearing

921
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:24,094
as both a food source,
and headrests.

922
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:30,470
Size and shape of breasts
may vary

923
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,975
from person to person,
but number

924
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,910
is constant: one, two.

925
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,140
Please?

926
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,589
Whoa.

927
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,436
Children!

928
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,438
-Who wants me to go on?
-Children!

929
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:03,598
Unlock this door.

930
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,942
Now, I didn't want to do this,

931
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,069
but it's part of the assignment.

932
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:13,412
These... are the ovaries.

933
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:23,949
That's where the eggs are.

934
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,618
Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs...

935
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,960
Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs,
eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs.

936
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,966
Each ovary is connected
to its very own Fallopian tube,

937
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,161
-which swings...
-Frank!

938
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,229
...which swings down
sort of like this,

939
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,501
Iike a little freeway.

940
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,064
I want this door open now!

941
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,167
Leading to...

942
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,804
the uterus--
about this size baby motel.

943
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,644
Just roughly... here.

944
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,944
What?

945
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:48,678
It tickles.

946
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,514
Oh, sorry.

947
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,679
Where was l?

948
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,552
The uterus.

949
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,784
Excuse me?

950
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,223
"This size baby motel."

951
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,749
Oh, right, right.

952
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,991
Which brings us to...
intercourse.

953
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,396
Whoa!

954
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,263
May I have a volunteer
from the class?

955
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:25,085
Here's something;
what do you think?

956
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,452
Mmm...

957
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,514
Okay, how about this one?

958
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:29,785
This is nice.

959
00:55:29,825 --> 00:55:31,224
I don't know.

960
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:36,391
I, I don't think that l,
I should wear her clothes.

961
00:55:36,432 --> 00:55:37,592
V?

962
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:38,725
Yeah.

963
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:39,962
Is it true

964
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:42,230
there's a place
on a woman you can touch

965
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:43,932
to make her
completely insane?

966
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:47,866
Where did you hear that?

967
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,844
A magazine.

968
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:53,076
Um, well...

969
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:55,640
Don't count on it.

970
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,550
Okay.

971
00:56:01,724 --> 00:56:03,715
How about this one?

972
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,056
Like it?

973
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,685
You know what I like about you?

974
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,520
Every time I think of you,
you appear.

975
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,565
Listen, if you're not
rushing off to see a client...

976
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,430
No.

977
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,663
Not in this dress.

978
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,965
Maybe we could have dinner
together.

979
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,474
-Yes.
-Really?

980
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:55,704
Yes. Yes.

981
00:56:57,246 --> 00:56:59,111
Okay.

982
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:00,775
I'm just going to change, okay?

983
00:57:00,816 --> 00:57:01,942
Yeah.

984
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:03,144
-Vicki?
-No.

985
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:04,709
-Valerie?
-No.

986
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,778
Virginia?

987
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:06,879
Hmm-mm.

988
00:57:06,922 --> 00:57:08,116
West Virginia.

989
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:21,566
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

990
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,663
He's changing right now.

991
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:24,934
I saw.

992
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:26,634
He's ironing like crazy.

993
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,602
What are you all dolled up for?

994
00:57:29,645 --> 00:57:30,771
I'm not.

995
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:31,939
Are you coming with us?

996
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,610
Gross! I have my own life,
thank you very much.

997
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:40,080
Is that cologne
that you're wearing?

998
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:41,248
No.

999
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,621
Are you going on a date?

1000
00:57:42,658 --> 00:57:45,218
Nah. Just practicing.

1001
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,319
What?

1002
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,159
Being cool,
in case I run into Stacy.

1003
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:49,664
Oh.

1004
00:57:49,698 --> 00:57:51,962
Do you have something
to give her?

1005
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:53,399
Is that a rule?

1006
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,238
No, but it should be.

1007
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,709
I mean, girls and gifts--
it's kind of the same word.

1008
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:01,971
Here, give her this.

1009
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,103
I can't take this.

1010
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:04,908
Why not?

1011
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,107
I'm not giving this to anyone.

1012
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:09,174
I'll keep it with me always.

1013
00:58:09,218 --> 00:58:10,617
Yeah?

1014
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,644
Thanks.

1015
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:14,679
You're welcome.

1016
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:21,861
I never had time to be lonely.

1017
00:58:21,897 --> 00:58:24,058
You know, I had Frank
to take care of,

1018
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,330
and I guess I buried myself
in my work.

1019
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:30,099
Other than Frank, the wetlands
mean everything to me.

1020
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,697
Yeah.

1021
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:36,705
Oh, look, honey,
it's Frank's dad.

1022
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:38,713
I wonder who that woman is.

1023
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:40,647
She's a hooker.

1024
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:43,578
Honey...!

1025
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:46,179
I can't believe
I'm saying all this to you.

1026
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:47,314
Why?

1027
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:49,085
I'm normally not like this.

1028
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,218
I'm not at ease with new people.

1029
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,750
No? Neither am l.

1030
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:53,955
-Really?
-Yeah,

1031
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:56,361
and in my line of work,
that's a problem.

1032
00:58:56,398 --> 00:58:58,093
Well, how
do you deal with it?

1033
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,692
Well, let's see.

1034
00:58:59,735 --> 00:59:02,169
When I'm with someone new,

1035
00:59:02,204 --> 00:59:05,901
I pretend like
I'm with someone that I love,

1036
00:59:06,008 --> 00:59:08,841
and that helps me
get through it.

1037
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,539
Oh...!

1038
00:59:12,314 --> 00:59:16,273
I don't think I've ever met
a more dedicated teacher.

1039
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:22,080
I don't think anyone's ever
looked at what I do that way.

1040
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:23,455
Well, why not?

1041
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:27,428
Just because you don't do it
in the classroom?

1042
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,829
You know, you're an amazing man.

1043
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:41,238
Right now... with me...

1044
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,437
What?

1045
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,604
Were you pretending?

1046
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:44,704
Pretending?

1047
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,477
That you're with someone else?

1048
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:49,074
Someone you love?

1049
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:53,384
No. I don't have to pretend
anything with you.

1050
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:57,415
Mmm, Holly, isn't that
your little friend's dad?

1051
00:59:57,459 --> 00:59:58,858
Yeah.

1052
00:59:58,894 --> 01:00:00,156
I wonder who he's with?

1053
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,824
It's his sister.

1054
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:09,168
I, I feel a-a strong,
almost mammalian pull

1055
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:10,467
towards you.

1056
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:15,805
You mean like how the moon
pulls the tides?

1057
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:19,336
Yes. Yes, just like that.

1058
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:23,078
Are you sure you don't mean
his sister-in-law?

1059
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:25,518
No. It's his sister.

1060
01:00:25,554 --> 01:00:27,249
Oh, well, I think that's sweet.

1061
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:29,484
They must be
a very affectionate family.

1062
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,618
You two could learn something
from them

1063
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,924
about just how close
a brother and sister

1064
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,954
can be.

1065
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:39,365
No one's ever said anything
like that to me before.

1066
01:00:39,401 --> 01:00:40,425
Say it again.

1067
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:41,493
What?

1068
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:42,663
The mammal word.

1069
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,639
Mammalian.

1070
01:00:44,673 --> 01:00:45,731
Yes, that's it.

1071
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,536
What does that mean?

1072
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:51,205
Mammals are
warm-blooded creatures.

1073
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:53,477
Warm?

1074
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:54,641
Very warm.

1075
01:00:54,683 --> 01:00:55,775
Yes?

1076
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:58,452
Yes.

1077
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:01,012
Very, very warm?

1078
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,768
There's no way I'm doing that.

1079
01:01:17,506 --> 01:01:20,532
-We should go.
-We should go.

1080
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:23,204
Um... where?

1081
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:26,146
Well, uh...
we're going to be late.

1082
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:27,978
Oh. Okay.

1083
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,484
We have reservations.

1084
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:31,042
Yeah.

1085
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,918
T om.

1086
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:39,985
Judy.

1087
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,997
Hi.

1088
01:01:42,064 --> 01:01:43,531
Kevin.

1089
01:01:43,565 --> 01:01:44,827
V.

1090
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,858
You know this woman, son?

1091
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:48,597
Not as well as we know

1092
01:01:48,637 --> 01:01:50,468
each other, Mr. Smith.

1093
01:01:52,274 --> 01:01:55,710
You... know her, Father?

1094
01:01:55,744 --> 01:01:57,405
Uh, no-- no, no, no, no.

1095
01:01:57,446 --> 01:02:01,109
No, you must be confusing me
with someone else.

1096
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,210
No, I may have the name wrong,
but I never forget a face.

1097
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,914
My name is V, like the letter.

1098
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:07,683
Your husband and I did business

1099
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:09,122
together once.

1100
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,956
Oh, yes, yes... of course.

1101
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,622
Yes, I'm sorry,
of course, yes.

1102
01:02:14,663 --> 01:02:17,860
Uh, V is a, um...
a dance instructor.

1103
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,765
She, she taught me how to dance.

1104
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:22,168
Dance? You teach dance
and you tutor math?

1105
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:23,398
Isn't that wonderful?

1106
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,101
We should all go out dancing
together sometime.

1107
01:02:26,141 --> 01:02:27,938
Oh, yes, let's do it soon.

1108
01:02:27,976 --> 01:02:30,501
Maybe V could teach us
a couple of things.

1109
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,672
Uh, she can't.

1110
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,773
Um... she's retired.

1111
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:34,908
Listen,

1112
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,417
it was really nice to see you,

1113
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,942
but we've really got
to get going.

1114
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:39,783
Good to see you.

1115
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,551
Okay, bye-bye.

1116
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:45,082
Huh. It's a small...

1117
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:47,891
V.

1118
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,761
V.

1119
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,603
Stop it.
What are you doing?

1120
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,902
You said you fixed it.

1121
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,203
What's wrong with you?

1122
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,939
I thought things were different,
but I was wrong.

1123
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,673
-What happened?
-I have to go.

1124
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:05,840
I don't understand.

1125
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,850
I know--
that's why I have to go!

1126
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,146
Well, let me take you.

1127
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,915
Do you even know where I live?

1128
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,478
No, I don't; I have no idea.

1129
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:15,820
Do you want to see where I live?

1130
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,052
-Yeah.
-Follow me.

1131
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,527
Why are we climbing this tree?

1132
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,341
What, may I ask,
are you doing

1133
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,143
Iiving in my son's tree house?

1134
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:42,241
T ake off your pants;
then I'll tell you.

1135
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:43,912
Why do I have
to take off my pants?

1136
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:44,977
Because in my experience,

1137
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,421
men are better listeners
when they're not wearing pants,

1138
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,253
and I have something personal
to tell you,

1139
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,089
and I don't want you
to be able to get away.

1140
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:52,958
Okay.

1141
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,758
Fine.

1142
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,628
I'm taking off my pants.

1143
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,190
This better be good.

1144
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,998
Nobody's ever treated me
the way you treat me.

1145
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,332
How am I treating you?

1146
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:03,804
Like a person.

1147
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,807
How does everybody else
treat you?

1148
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:08,241
Like a hooker.

1149
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,643
W-W-W-Why would they do that?

1150
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,240
Because I am a hooker.

1151
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,649
W-What do you mean by that,
exactly?

1152
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,680
Frank told me he told you.

1153
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:22,918
What?

1154
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,221
I'm a prostitute.

1155
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,955
Men pay me
to have sex with them.

1156
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,258
Well, then, what, may I ask,
are you doing

1157
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,094
teaching math
to seventh graders?!

1158
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,827
I don't teach math.

1159
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:34,062
No, no, Frank told me
you were a math tutor.

1160
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,469
Well, he told me
that he told you I was a hooker,

1161
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,767
and that you didn't care.

1162
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,104
My son bought me a hooker?

1163
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:40,233
Give me back my pants.

1164
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,972
No, he didn't buy me for you!

1165
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,512
Oh, what a relief.

1166
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,980
He just wants me to marry you.

1167
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,744
You said I looked
like Grace Kelly.

1168
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,217
Who told you that?

1169
01:04:50,252 --> 01:04:52,186
Frank. He probably lied
about that, too.

1170
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,987
No, he didn't. I...

1171
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,220
I did say that.

1172
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:00,922
You know,
I thought you were different.

1173
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:02,294
I thought
you were understanding.

1174
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,457
I am understanding.

1175
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:04,523
Boy, am I understanding.

1176
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,762
That would explain why
you looked at me that way.

1177
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:08,269
I looked at you that way

1178
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,363
because you looked at me
that way.

1179
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,464
What way?!

1180
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,600
Like I was somebody.

1181
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:14,700
Well, you are somebody.

1182
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,802
We're both somebodies.

1183
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:16,869
Let me out of here.

1184
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:18,243
How do you open this thing?

1185
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,145
I'm an adult somebody teacher,

1186
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,343
and you're
an adult somebody hooker

1187
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,114
that I'm supposed to marry.

1188
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,446
You should've told me.

1189
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:30,459
I tried to.

1190
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:31,721
You should've tried harder.

1191
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,853
Look, Dad, you always say

1192
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,658
it's not what you do,
it's who you are.

1193
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:35,959
But there's
a vast difference

1194
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:37,624
between being a math tutor...
Dad! Dad!

1195
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:38,826
There was no "but."

1196
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,267
I know you're trying
to help me.

1197
01:05:40,302 --> 01:05:41,667
Ah, Dad, she's the right woman.

1198
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,103
Well, what's so right about her?

1199
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,804
I took a test in this magazine.

1200
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,813
"Are you Your Mate's
Perfect Woman?"

1201
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,075
She scores a 98

1202
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,878
out of a possible 100,
losing one point

1203
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,350
because she's a total stranger,

1204
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,478
and the other 'cause
your entire relationship

1205
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,818
is based on a lie.

1206
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,823
What, you only lose one point
for that?

1207
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,654
It says it's not very important.

1208
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:05,216
What could possibly be
more important?

1209
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,592
She's a grown-up, she has a job,

1210
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,426
she's independent,
she's good with money,

1211
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,126
she's funny, she
doesn't swear anymore--

1212
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,566
I talked to her about that--

1213
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:15,035
she watches cartoons,
and she likes ice cream,

1214
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:16,766
and she fits into Mom's clothes.

1215
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,934
I knew that dress
looked familiar.

1216
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:22,944
And she likes you, Dad--
that's the best part!

1217
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,445
Where did you learn
to be like this?

1218
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,005
From you.

1219
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:57,975
So...

1220
01:06:58,013 --> 01:06:59,378
what does the magazine say?

1221
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,246
I mean, what am I supposed
to do now?

1222
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,581
Call her.

1223
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:06,019
On what?

1224
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:15,923
V?

1225
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,227
V?

1226
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,735
She's not picking up.

1227
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,374
V?!

1228
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:31,444
Oh!

1229
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,812
Geez!

1230
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,960
V, don't go.

1231
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:47,554
I thought that you were
my friend,

1232
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,996
but you're not--
you're a liar.

1233
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:58,974
Wait a minute.

1234
01:07:59,008 --> 01:07:59,975
I want to talk to you.

1235
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:00,976
Stay away from me.

1236
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,409
I'm the one who should be angry.

1237
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:03,570
I'm the one who was deceived.

1238
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:04,738
I am not angry.

1239
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,805
I just want to get
out of here.

1240
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,578
I don't like the suburbs.

1241
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,915
Car doesn't work.

1242
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:11,920
Keep it.

1243
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,285
It isn't mine anyway.

1244
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:04,969
Diaphragm.

1245
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:11,611
It's a locket.

1246
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,673
Somebody's empty locket.

1247
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,709
That's kind of sad.

1248
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,585
It's my locket.

1249
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,750
I gave it to him.

1250
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,692
He said he would keep it
forever.

1251
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:36,962
It's a picture of his mom.

1252
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:45,144
I didn't even know he had this.

1253
01:09:46,181 --> 01:09:50,618
She didn't look at all
like Grace Kelly.

1254
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:53,747
Neither do l, for that matter.

1255
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:56,383
You do to me.

1256
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:09,865
I don't want to have sex
with you, you know.

1257
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:15,170
I don't want to have sex
with you, either.

1258
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:21,649
I never really thought that she
looked like Grace Kelly.

1259
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:26,986
It was just the quality
that she had-- a feeling.

1260
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:30,150
And then it became a game
with Frank and me--

1261
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,355
who did and didn't have that...
this quality.

1262
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:37,354
It was so hard for me
to talk about her.

1263
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:44,131
It was the only way I could let
Frank know... about her.

1264
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:47,005
T ell me how you met.

1265
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:50,010
We knew each other
in high school, and--

1266
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,673
actually,
it was junior high school.

1267
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:56,583
I remember the first time
I saw her.

1268
01:10:57,619 --> 01:10:59,883
Yeah?

1269
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,221
She was leaning
on the kitchen counter

1270
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:05,658
talking on the telephone.

1271
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,628
We were at a dance.

1272
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:12,964
A dance?

1273
01:11:13,001 --> 01:11:16,129
I never went to a dance.

1274
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:19,140
Why not?

1275
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:22,473
'Cause I left home
when I was 14.

1276
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:26,845
I missed my whole life.

1277
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:44,657
If I'm the first, you know,
this might hurt a bit.

1278
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,999
You trying to be funny?

1279
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:51,836
I'm not talking about sex.

1280
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:55,275
What are you talking about?

1281
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,870
I want to make love with you.

1282
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:30,310
Eve, Eve...

1283
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:32,813
Eve's my middle name.

1284
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,577
And, l...

1285
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:39,144
I changed it because it
just sounded too Biblical,

1286
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,954
so I took off the Es.

1287
01:12:46,361 --> 01:12:48,693
This hurts.

1288
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:32,007
Ow! Ooch! Damn it!

1289
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,418
Yes, hello.

1290
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:52,087
Did you have somebody
in mind, sir?

1291
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:53,755
I have someone in mind.

1292
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:54,820
Her name is V.

1293
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:55,990
V?

1294
01:13:56,032 --> 01:13:59,160
We don't know where she-she is.

1295
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:01,670
That's bullshit!

1296
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:03,296
That's bullshit.

1297
01:14:03,339 --> 01:14:05,330
Oh, I saw her tonight,
in Middleton.

1298
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:06,774
You saw her in Middleton?

1299
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:07,935
Middleton?

1300
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:09,171
What address?

1301
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:13,949
He-he hung up.

1302
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:15,109
Of course.

1303
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,277
He hung up.

1304
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:18,116
Well, she shouldn't be
too hard to find.

1305
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:50,978
Good morning, Frank.
Good morning, Frank.

1306
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:52,645
Did I miss something?

1307
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:53,815
You sure did.

1308
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,289
V and I have been
in the wetlands

1309
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:56,656
collecting samples since dawn.

1310
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:58,320
Excuse me,
I have to get something

1311
01:14:58,361 --> 01:14:59,851
out of the garbage.

1312
01:15:10,974 --> 01:15:13,670
You looking for this?

1313
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,772
I'm sorry I lied.

1314
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:21,875
But you said the truth
gets you in trouble.

1315
01:15:21,918 --> 01:15:23,715
Yeah.

1316
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,277
Are you staying?

1317
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:27,221
For a while.

1318
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,951
As my mom?

1319
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,823
No, not as your mom.

1320
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,590
Well, then, as what?

1321
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:38,567
Um... as a friend of the family.

1322
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:40,501
That'll do.

1323
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,800
Good. Come on.

1324
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:45,330
There's just one more thing.

1325
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:55,810
Okay, now, I want you
to just watch my feet,

1326
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:58,685
and listen to the music, okay?

1327
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:02,925
See?

1328
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:04,426
Now, you try.

1329
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,894
Move your feet.

1330
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,795
I said move your feet, Frank.

1331
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:12,357
I am moving my feet.

1332
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:13,926
Okay.

1333
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,938
New deal.

1334
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:17,769
Um...

1335
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:20,901
Don't move your feet, okay?

1336
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:23,605
Just sort of sway your hips
from side to side.

1337
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:25,375
I don't want to move my hips--

1338
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:26,347
that's how it all starts.

1339
01:16:26,382 --> 01:16:27,349
What?

1340
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:28,611
Sex.

1341
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:30,141
I've decided
it's an evil scheme.

1342
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:32,086
Well, what can you do
with your body?

1343
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:34,055
I mean, something
where you have to...

1344
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,150
touch somebody else
and move at the same time.

1345
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:41,254
I-I can thumb wrestle.

1346
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:42,594
Okay.
That's good.

1347
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:44,429
All right, that's a start.

1348
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:46,628
Better watch out--
I'm pretty good.

1349
01:16:46,669 --> 01:16:49,229
One, two, three, four.

1350
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,933
Now we start the thumb war.

1351
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:01,707
Got you.

1352
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:02,649
-No, you didn't.
-Got you.

1353
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:11,023
Come on.

1354
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,085
Yeah!

1355
01:17:15,565 --> 01:17:16,930
Frank?

1356
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:18,227
Whoa...!

1357
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:19,097
Frank.

1358
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:20,102
Yeah?

1359
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,694
You're dancing.

1360
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:24,468
You're dancing, dude.

1361
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,112
Good morning.

1362
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,613
Good morning.

1363
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,739
Nice day, isn't it?

1364
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:44,624
Sour cream and onion.

1365
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,127
Popsicles?

1366
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,789
Sure.

1367
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:48,956
Pretzels?

1368
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,465
Yeah.

1369
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,491
Oh, Fluff.

1370
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:56,505
Hi. How are you?

1371
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:57,904
Great.

1372
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:17,419
Excuse me, ma'am.

1373
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,223
Have you seen this woman?

1374
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,354
It's important.

1375
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:25,196
Well, take your time.
I've got all day.

1376
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:26,223
No...

1377
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:28,066
I can't say as I have.

1378
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:30,072
Sorry.

1379
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:39,237
I beg your pardon...

1380
01:18:39,282 --> 01:18:42,342
Mom? Can I have
the new Cosmo, please?

1381
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:46,187
My mom-- she's the greatest.

1382
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:03,435
Where are we going so fast?

1383
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,439
You're going home.

1384
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,498
I'm taking the fastest
way out of here.

1385
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,237
But he didn't even
recognize you.

1386
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:10,609
For all he knows,
you're a million miles away.

1387
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:12,637
He doesn't know my dad
can't fix cars.

1388
01:19:12,682 --> 01:19:15,116
I'm not staying, Frank.

1389
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:22,857
So, this is what it's like.

1390
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:24,154
What do you mean?

1391
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:26,889
T o have a mom.

1392
01:19:35,872 --> 01:19:37,863
You look cool, Frank.

1393
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:40,171
You look very, very cool.

1394
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:44,641
And tonight,
Stacy's going to think

1395
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,944
you look very cool, too.

1396
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:49,314
V, don't go.

1397
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,861
It's going to be fun.
Come on.

1398
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:52,007
Oh, shit!

1399
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:54,009
Frank! V!

1400
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:57,443
Frank! V!

1401
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,948
I found out what's wrong
with the car!

1402
01:21:59,982 --> 01:22:01,813
Frank!

1403
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:04,046
Frank? V?

1404
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:06,714
Frank?

1405
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:10,351
Where is everybody?

1406
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:02,598
What happened to you?

1407
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,199
I stopped washing...
completely.

1408
01:24:08,612 --> 01:24:09,874
You smell.

1409
01:24:09,913 --> 01:24:12,313
I will no longer be
my father's dupe.

1410
01:24:12,349 --> 01:24:14,442
You don't look so good yourself.

1411
01:24:14,484 --> 01:24:15,508
What's up?

1412
01:24:15,552 --> 01:24:17,042
Lots of things.

1413
01:24:17,087 --> 01:24:19,555
I mean, Stacy loves Brad,

1414
01:24:19,589 --> 01:24:21,216
which makes me feel
like I can't breathe.

1415
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:23,554
Mm.

1416
01:24:23,593 --> 01:24:25,390
It'd be different
if V were here.

1417
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:29,057
Really?

1418
01:24:29,099 --> 01:24:30,498
Think so, huh?

1419
01:24:30,534 --> 01:24:32,934
And what would you do
if V were here?

1420
01:24:32,969 --> 01:24:35,267
I'd ask her to dance.

1421
01:24:35,305 --> 01:24:38,206
Prove it.

1422
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:57,986
Frank.

1423
01:24:58,094 --> 01:25:00,688
Couldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

1424
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:02,391
Would you like to dance?

1425
01:25:02,432 --> 01:25:03,922
I thought you didn't know how.

1426
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,467
I don't.

1427
01:25:05,502 --> 01:25:07,834
Well, what do you do at a dance
if you can't dance?

1428
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:10,732
I thumb wrestle.

1429
01:25:18,381 --> 01:25:19,814
-Look, sweetie.
-Huh?

1430
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:21,544
It's your dance instructor.

1431
01:25:21,585 --> 01:25:22,677
Oh...

1432
01:25:31,828 --> 01:25:33,455
Oh, yes!

1433
01:25:51,648 --> 01:25:53,878
She's very good, isn't she?

1434
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:56,112
Hmm? Yes. Yes.

1435
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:59,178
Oh, yes.

1436
01:26:06,363 --> 01:26:08,092
He can dance.

1437
01:26:08,131 --> 01:26:11,658
He can dance really well.

1438
01:26:15,005 --> 01:26:16,097
She's a math tutor.

1439
01:26:16,139 --> 01:26:18,369
Can she solve
multivariable equations?

1440
01:26:18,408 --> 01:26:20,638
What are the odds of finding
another woman with that body

1441
01:26:20,677 --> 01:26:23,043
and those skills?

1442
01:26:58,682 --> 01:27:00,411
Here comes my jacket.

1443
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:02,111
I think he likes you.

1444
01:27:02,152 --> 01:27:03,642
Think he does?

1445
01:27:03,687 --> 01:27:07,088
-Hi.
-Hi.

1446
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:10,115
Would you like this?

1447
01:27:19,069 --> 01:27:20,798
Would you like to dance?

1448
01:27:34,317 --> 01:27:36,148
Did I miss something?

1449
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:55,802
Mine.

1450
01:28:00,944 --> 01:28:02,036
Wait right here.

1451
01:28:02,078 --> 01:28:04,273
-Wait, wait, Robert.
-Don't move.

1452
01:28:04,314 --> 01:28:07,147
What are you, what are you
going to do?

1453
01:28:07,183 --> 01:28:11,347
I'm going to the sock hop...
whatever that is.

1454
01:28:11,388 --> 01:28:15,154
I have something important
to tell you.

1455
01:28:15,191 --> 01:28:19,423
You don't want me to leave?

1456
01:28:19,462 --> 01:28:22,590
Right, I don't want you
to leave, but...

1457
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:24,623
there's something else, too.

1458
01:28:27,103 --> 01:28:28,297
You've got a lot of nerve

1459
01:28:28,338 --> 01:28:30,499
bringing a slut like this
into our school.

1460
01:28:41,718 --> 01:28:43,515
You turned my son into a pig.

1461
01:28:45,155 --> 01:28:46,122
Yeah, but he's a...

1462
01:28:46,156 --> 01:28:47,123
...happy

1463
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:48,124
...pig.

1464
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:50,126
There are children here.

1465
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,958
There are children here!

1466
01:28:52,996 --> 01:28:55,658
Fight, fight, fight...

1467
01:28:59,235 --> 01:29:01,567
I'm happy to see you, V.

1468
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,800
Yeah. It's a real gun.

1469
01:29:04,841 --> 01:29:05,808
Hey! Hey-hey-hey.

1470
01:29:05,842 --> 01:29:07,469
Whoa! Whoa-whoa,
come on, come on.

1471
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,875
I'd ask you to dance, but...

1472
01:29:08,912 --> 01:29:11,380
seems you got the last geezer
in a bit of trouble.

1473
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:22,824
You thought you could take
my money and get away with it?

1474
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:24,724
Well, my little bluebird,
you thought wrong.

1475
01:29:24,761 --> 01:29:26,092
You know I wouldn't steal
from you, Waltzer.

1476
01:29:26,129 --> 01:29:27,118
Oh?

1477
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:33,726
Waltzer...

1478
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,032
You think I'm stupid,
is that it?

1479
01:29:35,071 --> 01:29:36,333
-No.
-I know the whole story.

1480
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:37,532
Cash steals from me.

1481
01:29:37,574 --> 01:29:40,270
He hides $250,000
in the gas tank of his car.

1482
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:41,334
I hated Cash.

1483
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:42,674
You stole his car,
and then it's my money

1484
01:29:42,712 --> 01:29:43,940
that's paying
for your nice little life

1485
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:45,412
-in the suburbs.
-No, I wouldn't do that.

1486
01:29:45,448 --> 01:29:46,540
I wouldn't do
anything like that.

1487
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:47,709
Oh, yeah?

1488
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,774
-Give me your best shot.
-Really?

1489
01:29:48,818 --> 01:29:49,910
-Give me your best shot.
-Yeah?

1490
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:57,851
Now, here's the best part.

1491
01:29:57,894 --> 01:30:00,362
Are you listening?
Get this, Cloth Ears.

1492
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:02,296
One: I kill Cash,
I kill you--

1493
01:30:02,332 --> 01:30:03,731
I get my money back.

1494
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:04,733
All right?

1495
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:06,064
I love happy endings.

1496
01:30:06,102 --> 01:30:07,467
Wait a minute--
there's money in the car?

1497
01:30:07,504 --> 01:30:10,132
"Wait a minute--
there's money in the..."

1498
01:30:10,173 --> 01:30:11,800
It's still there.

1499
01:30:20,717 --> 01:30:21,979
Come on, come on!

1500
01:30:22,018 --> 01:30:23,076
What? What?

1501
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:24,279
Hey, Mister,
I know a shortcut.

1502
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,287
Fire?

1503
01:30:25,321 --> 01:30:27,585
I don't like fire!

1504
01:30:27,624 --> 01:30:30,286
Come on, this way,
over here, come on!

1505
01:30:30,326 --> 01:30:31,623
Thanks, Sonny Jim.

1506
01:30:31,661 --> 01:30:34,562
Oh, my God--
it's a closet.

1507
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:35,757
Yes!

1508
01:30:35,798 --> 01:30:37,925
I don't like closets!

1509
01:30:37,967 --> 01:30:40,299
It's dark in here!

1510
01:30:45,141 --> 01:30:45,208
Come on!

1511
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,073
Come on!

1512
01:30:53,349 --> 01:30:54,907
-There it is-- let's go!
-Okay.

1513
01:30:57,653 --> 01:31:00,121
Little bastards.

1514
01:31:00,156 --> 01:31:01,987
Who's driving?

1515
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:06,226
Frank! Frank, you let me drive.

1516
01:31:06,262 --> 01:31:08,628
Let's go!

1517
01:31:09,932 --> 01:31:11,194
Yes!

1518
01:31:11,234 --> 01:31:12,792
There's no bloody fire!

1519
01:31:12,835 --> 01:31:14,359
Get out the bloody way!

1520
01:31:14,403 --> 01:31:15,631
There's no fire...

1521
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:23,744
Get out... come on,
get out the bloody way.

1522
01:31:23,779 --> 01:31:24,768
Get out of the way!

1523
01:31:28,084 --> 01:31:31,247
What the bloody hell
happened, huh?!

1524
01:31:31,287 --> 01:31:34,950
Well... some very small
person took the car,

1525
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:37,118
but I broke a nail, which is...

1526
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,148
Broke a nail?

1527
01:31:38,194 --> 01:31:39,889
I'll break your bloody neck.

1528
01:31:39,929 --> 01:31:41,089
-Get in there.
-Ow!

1529
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,791
You're not even worth
the price of a bullet.

1530
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:44,197
Oh, yes, I am.

1531
01:31:44,233 --> 01:31:45,791
Oh, no, you're not!

1532
01:31:45,835 --> 01:31:47,496
Oh, yes, I am.

1533
01:31:49,705 --> 01:31:50,694
You're not.

1534
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:51,729
Am, too!

1535
01:31:51,774 --> 01:31:52,763
Not!

1536
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:53,797
Am, too!

1537
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,242
Shut up! You're not!

1538
01:31:58,547 --> 01:31:59,639
Slow down!

1539
01:31:59,682 --> 01:32:00,706
I can't reach
the pedals

1540
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,183
and steer at the same time!

1541
01:32:02,218 --> 01:32:03,480
I've got some major
cruise control

1542
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:04,383
going here!

1543
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,320
All right, you steer,
I'll do pedals.

1544
01:32:06,355 --> 01:32:07,322
Good idea!

1545
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:09,256
No, bad idea.
Let me drive!

1546
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:11,556
You can't drive from
the back seat-- it's illegal!

1547
01:32:11,594 --> 01:32:12,720
Look out, look out!

1548
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:18,890
Oh, oh...

1549
01:32:18,934 --> 01:32:20,231
This is the sidewalk!

1550
01:32:20,269 --> 01:32:21,668
Sidewalk?

1551
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:24,865
Oh, people!

1552
01:32:30,913 --> 01:32:32,073
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1553
01:32:32,114 --> 01:32:33,513
That was part of the car!

1554
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:34,709
Brake! Brake!

1555
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,183
Gas!

1556
01:32:37,253 --> 01:32:38,743
Brake.

1557
01:32:38,788 --> 01:32:40,585
Gas! Gas-- he's coming!

1558
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:45,085
Oh, my God! Jesus!

1559
01:32:46,128 --> 01:32:47,527
Here comes the pimp-mobile.

1560
01:32:47,563 --> 01:32:48,359
Brake!

1561
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:49,921
Gas, gas!

1562
01:33:02,011 --> 01:33:03,808
All right!
I see it, I see it!

1563
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,647
Wait, left!

1564
01:33:12,688 --> 01:33:14,588
Um, um, um, um...

1565
01:33:14,623 --> 01:33:15,749
-Right!
-No, left!

1566
01:33:18,961 --> 01:33:19,427
Left!

1567
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:24,224
You know that thing on the car--
well, it's gone.

1568
01:33:24,266 --> 01:33:25,893
Do we need it?

1569
01:33:28,104 --> 01:33:29,799
Let me drive!

1570
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,664
You broke the car!

1571
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:33,470
Go right!

1572
01:33:35,177 --> 01:33:36,804
You lost the steering wheel?

1573
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:39,647
Who's smoking?

1574
01:33:39,682 --> 01:33:40,910
It's the car!

1575
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:49,688
That mad, frigging tart!

1576
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,491
Sounds like a train.

1577
01:33:53,529 --> 01:33:55,087
I think it is a train.

1578
01:33:55,131 --> 01:33:56,928
Well, what's it doing?

1579
01:33:58,501 --> 01:33:59,559
Oh, nothing.

1580
01:33:59,602 --> 01:34:00,830
Oh, my God!

1581
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:03,768
Brake! We'll never make it!

1582
01:34:03,806 --> 01:34:06,172
No, go, go!

1583
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:07,470
We'll make it! Faster!

1584
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:08,499
Brake!

1585
01:34:08,544 --> 01:34:10,034
Make up your minds!

1586
01:34:12,782 --> 01:34:14,306
All right, all right!

1587
01:34:15,418 --> 01:34:16,350
Brake!

1588
01:34:16,385 --> 01:34:17,409
Gas!

1589
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:20,351
Oh, my God!

1590
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:31,833
What happened?

1591
01:34:31,867 --> 01:34:32,663
Fire!

1592
01:34:32,701 --> 01:34:33,497
She's going to blow!

1593
01:34:34,236 --> 01:34:35,396
It's a fire. Get out!

1594
01:34:35,438 --> 01:34:36,871
Get out!

1595
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:40,606
Ow, you big jerk!

1596
01:34:40,643 --> 01:34:42,076
You could have killed me.

1597
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,510
Jesus...

1598
01:34:45,548 --> 01:34:47,209
She's going to blow!

1599
01:34:49,685 --> 01:34:50,811
Get away!

1600
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:51,717
Come on, get out, Frank.

1601
01:34:51,754 --> 01:34:54,689
Pull, pull!
Get him out!

1602
01:34:54,723 --> 01:34:55,519
Get him out of here!

1603
01:34:55,558 --> 01:34:57,719
Get him out!

1604
01:35:16,445 --> 01:35:20,108
They're children, you big dope!

1605
01:35:31,427 --> 01:35:34,692
Oh, God-- they blew up

1606
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:36,891
my bloody money!

1607
01:35:38,634 --> 01:35:40,192
When I find her

1608
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:43,171
I'm going to rip her face off
and put it in a jar.

1609
01:35:43,205 --> 01:35:44,467
Get in the car!

1610
01:35:44,507 --> 01:35:45,769
Shut up.

1611
01:35:45,808 --> 01:35:47,969
Just get in there!

1612
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:50,979
Oh, she's gone,
Waltzer, she's gone.

1613
01:35:51,013 --> 01:35:54,039
Oh, shut up.
Cork your bloody beak.

1614
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:09,090
Frank!

1615
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:10,223
Dad, Dad!

1616
01:36:10,266 --> 01:36:11,733
Oh!

1617
01:36:16,539 --> 01:36:17,563
You okay?

1618
01:36:17,606 --> 01:36:18,868
Yeah.

1619
01:36:18,908 --> 01:36:20,068
We blew up the car.

1620
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:24,679
You boys all right?

1621
01:36:24,713 --> 01:36:26,442
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1622
01:36:26,482 --> 01:36:28,780
Was V with you?

1623
01:36:28,817 --> 01:36:30,045
Well, yeah, she was with us.

1624
01:36:30,085 --> 01:36:31,052
Did she get out?

1625
01:36:31,086 --> 01:36:32,553
Well, yeah, she got out,
and then...

1626
01:36:32,588 --> 01:36:33,850
I don't know what happened.

1627
01:36:33,889 --> 01:36:34,947
Well, where is she?

1628
01:36:35,057 --> 01:36:36,183
Where is she?

1629
01:36:36,225 --> 01:36:37,283
Dad!

1630
01:36:37,326 --> 01:36:40,124
Dad, she's gone.

1631
01:36:46,635 --> 01:36:49,103
She's gone, Dad.

1632
01:37:26,308 --> 01:37:27,935
This way.

1633
01:37:27,977 --> 01:37:29,239
Thank you.

1634
01:37:39,388 --> 01:37:41,356
I want out.

1635
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:55,728
You'd be taking money
out of my pocket.

1636
01:37:55,771 --> 01:37:58,934
Waltzer's taken out a lot more
than I ever put in.

1637
01:37:58,974 --> 01:38:02,671
I'm saving you a fortune, Jerry.

1638
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:05,202
I mean, let me go, please.

1639
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:12,042
Good-bye, my child.

1640
01:38:12,087 --> 01:38:14,214
Thank you.

1641
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:20,926
What about Waltzer?

1642
01:38:20,963 --> 01:38:24,865
After today,
Waltzer doesn't exist anymore.

1643
01:40:17,746 --> 01:40:19,907
Oh, my God!

1644
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,882
Oh, my God!

1645
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:52,745
Nice chains, Mr. Wheeler.

1646
01:40:52,781 --> 01:40:54,544
My dad's in therapy,
Mr. Wheeler.

1647
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:55,572
Thanks.

1648
01:40:55,617 --> 01:40:57,016
Dad, please, you lost.

1649
01:40:57,118 --> 01:40:59,245
You chained yourself
to the truck two days ago,

1650
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:01,118
and the local paper
didn't even show up.

1651
01:41:01,156 --> 01:41:04,614
T om, you unchain yourself,
nobody's pressing charges.

1652
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:05,921
Please, Dad.

1653
01:41:05,961 --> 01:41:08,759
We have to cut you free,
you're going to jail.

1654
01:41:08,797 --> 01:41:09,889
Dad!

1655
01:41:09,931 --> 01:41:14,197
When this place goes,
a part of me goes with it...

1656
01:41:14,236 --> 01:41:17,967
a part of all of us.

1657
01:41:18,073 --> 01:41:21,304
I'll go to jail.

1658
01:41:25,113 --> 01:41:27,138
Okay, we're ready to go.

1659
01:41:27,182 --> 01:41:30,310
T om, you're under arrest.

1660
01:41:30,352 --> 01:41:31,376
Dad!

1661
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:32,852
You have the right
to remain silent.

1662
01:41:32,888 --> 01:41:34,879
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1663
01:41:34,923 --> 01:41:36,857
in a court of law.

1664
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:40,852
If you so desire and
cannot afford one,

1665
01:41:40,896 --> 01:41:42,921
an attorney will be
appointed for you

1666
01:41:42,964 --> 01:41:44,295
without charge
before questioning.

1667
01:41:44,332 --> 01:41:45,890
Do you understand
each of these rights?

1668
01:41:45,934 --> 01:41:46,798
Forget it, Charlie.

1669
01:41:46,835 --> 01:41:47,802
He's got the right to do

1670
01:41:47,836 --> 01:41:50,270
any damn thing he pleases.

1671
01:41:50,305 --> 01:41:52,034
What's going on here?

1672
01:41:57,112 --> 01:41:58,773
What is that?

1673
01:41:58,813 --> 01:42:00,781
A deed.

1674
01:42:00,815 --> 01:42:05,809
It's a deed to the wetlands
in my name.

1675
01:42:05,854 --> 01:42:07,344
What...

1676
01:42:07,389 --> 01:42:11,587
Somebody bought the T onapaya
Wetlands in my name.

1677
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:12,820
Who did this?

1678
01:42:13,895 --> 01:42:16,625
She did it.

1679
01:42:18,033 --> 01:42:19,125
V!

1680
01:42:19,167 --> 01:42:21,965
Oh, V!

1681
01:42:24,472 --> 01:42:25,962
T om, I'm happy for you.

1682
01:42:26,007 --> 01:42:28,840
All right, boys,
let's pack it in and go home.

1683
01:42:28,877 --> 01:42:29,935
You go home, Tiny.

1684
01:42:34,883 --> 01:42:37,784
Does this mean you're staying?

1685
01:42:39,321 --> 01:42:41,221
Come on,
I have to talk to your dad.

1686
01:42:43,558 --> 01:42:44,684
Oh, wow.

1687
01:42:44,726 --> 01:42:46,990
This is so cool.

1688
01:42:47,062 --> 01:42:50,998
Well, you guys take care
of yourselves.

1689
01:42:51,032 --> 01:42:52,693
Yeah, yeah.

1690
01:42:52,734 --> 01:42:54,133
Yeah, yeah.

1691
01:43:00,976 --> 01:43:02,341
It was your money, you know.

1692
01:43:02,377 --> 01:43:04,106
You should've
spent it on yourself.

1693
01:43:04,145 --> 01:43:06,272
I did. I bought a few things.

1694
01:43:07,716 --> 01:43:09,684
This was for you and me.

1695
01:43:09,718 --> 01:43:12,346
Glossy ibis has to have a home.

1696
01:43:12,387 --> 01:43:14,355
Thanks.

1697
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:19,186
T ell me I'm worth waiting for.

1698
01:43:19,227 --> 01:43:22,196
You're worth much more
than that.

1699
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:43,179
Well, where are you going?

1700
01:43:43,218 --> 01:43:44,913
How will we find you?

1701
01:43:44,953 --> 01:43:48,218
You know that ice cream parlor?

1702
01:43:48,256 --> 01:43:49,223
Yeah.

1703
01:43:49,257 --> 01:43:51,782
You know, the one where
you first kissed me?

1704
01:43:51,826 --> 01:43:53,691
Yeah.

1705
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:56,288
I bought it.

1706
01:43:57,799 --> 01:43:59,198
You're staying here?

1707
01:43:59,234 --> 01:44:00,258
Uh-huh.

1708
01:44:00,301 --> 01:44:01,563
Here?

1709
01:44:01,603 --> 01:44:04,071
You know what?

1710
01:44:04,105 --> 01:44:08,269
There is a place you can touch
a woman that'll drive her crazy.

1711
01:44:08,309 --> 01:44:09,742
Where?

1712
01:44:11,212 --> 01:44:13,146
Her heart.

1713
01:44:23,191 --> 01:44:24,681
See you.

1714
01:44:36,037 --> 01:44:37,766
I have a hair.

1715
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:42,942
I have a hair!
