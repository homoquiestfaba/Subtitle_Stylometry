01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:16,845
She wasn't afraid
of anything.

1412
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:19,614
She--She'd
dine and dash.

1413
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:23,351

butter-flavored topping.

She was gonna open
a vegan restaurant.

Can we not
do this right now?

1417
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:32,227
She was gonna
cook veggies,

1418
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:34,396
and I
was gonna paint.

1419
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:37,499

She was beautiful.

Well, she grew up, Duncan.

Do you really think
we knew who we were
back then?

1427

I think we knew
how to be happy.

1428
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:00,989
Well, sometimes
life isn't happy.

Sometimes you do
what you have to do

1430

I want to paint.

Okay, here it goes.
You're stuck.

It takes time
to make something
beautiful, Sam.

1455

It took 9 months
to make each one of our
beautiful children.

I can't continue this way.

01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:20,168
I can't do this anymore.
I just can't.

01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,237
What do you mean
you can't do this?

1462
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,905
Marriage is
a partnership, Duncan,

1463
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:26,341
and right now
you are a lousy partner.

1464
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:27,342

I love your talent, Duncan.

Sometimes it's just--
It's not enough.

You could have taken
that graphic design job
I got for you.

Do you want me
to be someone else?

I never asked you to be
someone else, Duncan.

Ohh.

Great. Then go
further away.
