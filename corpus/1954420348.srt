1
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,687
There you are, good as new.

2
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,501
Now arriving Greendale Station.
Please disembark to your left.

3
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,628
Thank you so much, porter.

4
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,010
- Isn’t this marvelous weather?
- Oh, yes, indeed.

5
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,993
Oh, thanks, Jess.

6
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,288
It wouldn't do to forget my hat
on such a lovely morning!

7
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, Pat, that's not all you forgot.

8
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:30,877
Thanks, love.

9
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,674
Of course, Jess. Extra milk and no coffee.

10
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,970
Aw. You're so thoughtful, Sara.

11
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,556
This year, I’m finally taking you
on a proper honeymoon.

12
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,350
- I promise!
- Oh! You mean it, Pat?

13
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,811
I’ve always dreamed of a holiday in Italy.

14
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,897
Really? Italy?

15
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:56,569
Do you suppose that's why I sent away
for some hotel recommendations in Rome?

16
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,363
I’ll be getting my bonus today.
I’ll use it to book our flights.

17
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,907
- Whoa!
- Sorry, Dad!

18
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,075
I'm practicing the trick
shot you taught me.

19
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,660
Come on then, Julian. What have you got?

20
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,371
Are you sure, Dad? I’m getting pretty good.

21
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,206
Now remember what I taught you. Stay loose.

22
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,542
You gotta stay loose. Keep it loose.

23
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,420
Yes!

24
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,884
Nice one, son! You're
getting better every day!

25
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,511
I hear them cheering for you
in the stands right now.

26
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,513
"Pencaster United!"

27
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,100
Dad. I don't play for Pencaster, yet.

28
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,226
Ah, come on!

29
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,592
You'll be in the team before
you can say "boo" to a goose.

30
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,029
- Have a good day, dear!
- Always do!

31
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,614
Bye, love! Bye, Julian!

32
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,449
Right, how about some music?

33
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,703
Good morning, Greendale!

34
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,499
Here's the Saturdays' latest hit single,
Please Mr Postman.

35
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,417
I wish I was a postman.

36
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,671
Oh! I love this song, Jess!

37
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,342
- Bye, love!
- Bye, Dad!

38
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,302
- How do, Pat.
- Good morning!

39
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,272
Hello, Jess.

40
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,607
Good morning, Pat.

41
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,317
- Hey, Pat!
- Morning, George.

42
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,403
- Hello, Pat!
- Good morning, Pat!

43
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,199
- Hello, Pat!
- Good morning, Pat!

44
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,826
Hello, Τed! Nice to see you, Amy!

45
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,204
- Good morning, Constable Selby.
- Good morning, Pat.

46
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,041
- Good morning, Pat.
- Good morning, Pat.

47
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,335
- Hello, Mr Clifton.
- Morning, Jess.

48
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,580
- Morning, Pat.
- Pat! Oh, Pat! I have something for you!

49
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,880
Yes, Lizzy?

50
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,468
I have a very special
letter for you to deliver.

51
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,264
It's a bit early for letters
to Father Christmas, isn't it?

52
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,890
I want to avoid the rush.

53
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,476
Well, this is a very special letter.

54
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,479
I’ll make sure it gets delivered.

55
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,023
I knew you would, Pat.

56
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,942
Thank you, Pat. Say hello to Sara for me.

57
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,027
Bye, Pat!

58
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,737
Goodbye, Lizzy. Bye, Lauren.

59
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,780
- Have a good day, Constable.
- You too, Pat.

60
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,910
Wish I was a postman.

61
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,456
Good morning, Pat.

62
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,791
Hello, Mrs Goggins!
Any local deliveries today?

63
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,585
- Just these, Pat.
- Thanks.

64
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,212
And a few things to keep
in mind today, Pat.

65
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,050
Michael's repainting his shop,
so you mustn't use the letterbox.

66
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,470
- Got it!
- And Julia Pottage has a dreadful cold,

67
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,138
so don't ring the bell.

68
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,639
Right. That’s all then?

69
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,183
- Have a good day.
- Thanks!

70
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,185
Let's go, Jess.

71
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,275
Major Forbes?

72
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,652
Delivery, Major Forbes.

73
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,154
Major Forbes?

74
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,742
Hello? Major Forbes!

75
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,911
Major Forbes!

76
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,081
Oh, dear. He can't hear us.

77
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,083
He really needs these, Jess.

78
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:03,089
- I think this calls for manoeuvre 1 7.
- Mmm-hmm!

79
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,846
Great job, Jess!

80
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,431
Here it comes. Catch!

81
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,814
Sorry, Jess. My fault.

82
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,865
Oh! What was that?

83
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,327
Oh! Oh, Jess! Well, it's
jolly good to see you.

84
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,870
Why didn't you ring the bell?

85
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,875
Ah, there's Keats
and Βyron and Shelley.

86
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,461
And there's Τennyson and...
Oh, Lord Alfred.

87
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,630
Uh, five, six, seven...

88
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,132
Morning, Alf. How’s the flock?

89
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,968
Oh, hello, Pat. Fine. Just fine.

90
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,263
- Where's Abigail?
- Actually, I was just wondering that myself.

91
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,516
Abigail?

92
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,311
Oh, Alf. Not again.

93
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,901
Well done, Jess!

94
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,363
Thanks, Jess!

95
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,906
I wish I was a postman.

96
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,324
See you tomorrow, Alf.

97
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,924
Well, that was a fine day's work.
Mission accomplished!

98
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:34,346
I hope we get our bonus today.
Sara seemed very excited about the trip...

99
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,933
- Morning, Pat. Sorry, we're a bit busy.
- Ηiya, Pat! Ηiya, Jess!

100
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,936
- Pat! Am I glad to see you!
- Hello, Βen.

101
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,105
I didn't know SDS did airmail.

102
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,691
We don't. It's the new executive
from corporate headquarters.

103
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,528
He’s replaced my sorting system
with more "efficient" machines!

104
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,073
And they're very efficiently not working!

105
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,535
Lots of wasted time,
space and energy here, Βen.

106
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,954
Not sure even my machines
can save this place.

107
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,374
- Hello! Nice to meet you.
- You are...

108
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,460
Postman Clifton.

109
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,794
It's Pat, actually.

110
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,964
Yes. Slow delivery record,

111
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,468
but apparently you're effective
when it comes to misplaced livestock.

112
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,387
Mr Carbunkle, Pat is our
very best postman...

113
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:20,184
The future of the Special Delivery Service
is speed, Mr Τaylor, not wool gathering.

114
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Wool gathering.

115
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,270
That was rather good.

116
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,275
If I could have everyone's attention?

117
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,149
Thank you.

118
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,986
SDS has some exciting
and profitable changes in the works.

119
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,530
- Hello, Jess.
- Ahhh!

120
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,575
From now on, all company tea bags

121
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,828
must be used a minimum
of three times before disposal.

122
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,413
- Deary me.
- That’s me cup of tea.

123
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,792
Toilet breaks are now Β-Y-O-P.
Βring Your Own Paper.

124
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,002
Huh? But I had a curry for lunch.

125
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,589
And it goes without saying,
there will be no bonuses this year.

126
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,925
No bonuses? But Italy...

127
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,804
The Special Delivery Service is changing.

128
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,973
New ideas. New management.

129
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,685
If you want to keep this office open,
I suggest you get with the programme.

130
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,604
I also suggest you get back to work.

131
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,454
Oh, goodness, Jess, what a day.

132
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:26,041
Do you think Sara will be very
disappointed about canceling the trip?

133
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,130
Well, maybe she wasn't looking
forward to Italy all that much.

134
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,217
Uh... Oh.

135
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,553
Sara? Are we having a fancy dress party?

136
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,597
No, silly! I just wanted to get us
in the mood for our holiday.

137
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,100
Come in! Or as they say in Italy...

138
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,354
Oh. Or maybe that's
something about a hedgehog.

139
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,565
Oh, I’m so excited, Pat.

140
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,485
Did you know Italian is one
of the romantic languages?

141
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,571
I’ve been looking at hotels.

142
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,905
- They’re a bit expensive.
- Sara, I...

143
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,574
But we've been looking
forward to this trip for so long!

144
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,076
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh, me, too, Pat.

145
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,245
- I think we should go to Venice first.
- Right.

146
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,122
Only, one small thing.

147
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,458
A man from head office came by today.

148
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,084
Smoke?

149
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,170
Oh! The caprese salad!

150
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,676
- Need some help, love?
- Oh, no! I’m all right. Thank you!

151
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,305
- Does one actually cook a caprese salad?
- She does.

152
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,601
- You're The One is back on! Come on, Dad!
- You're The One?

153
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,603
Oh, Dad, it's just massive!

154
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,231
It's a talent show where ordinary people
compete for recording contracts,

155
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,276
trips and all sorts of
really amazing prizes.

Oh.

There’s actually quite a bit more.

Don't threaten me.

167
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,187
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

168
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,271
My name's Ronan.

169
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,691
Ronald, they did tell you
that this is a talent show?

170
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,820
Well, yes, they did. You know, I do actually
have a bit of experience with this.

171
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,947
I'm sorry. Can we get a translator in here?

172
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,990
I think he's speaking
Australian or something.

173
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,784
Actually, I’m from Ireland originally.

174
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:29,123
Then I hope all the horseless carriages
and aeroplanes here haven't frightened you.

175
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,707
Oh.

176
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,418
Am I on to the next round then?

177
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:37,381
If we were playing Russian roulette.
Simon says, "Next!"

178
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,199
Well, thanks for the opportunity...

179
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,510
He’s a bit harsh, isn't he?

180
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,930
That’s what makes the show so good.
Everybody watches it.

181
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,393
I’m Simon Cowbell
and we'll be back after this break.

182
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,103
Unfortunately.

183
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,525
Television is a vast wasteland.

184
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,862
All right. This is it! We're up next!

185
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,072
All the lessons and work are about to be...

186
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,825
Josh! Try to remember why we're here!

187
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,661
What would I be today
if I wasted my life on video games?

188
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,872
A talent agent with only one client?

189
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,251
Look, laddie, I have swindled a lot of old
ladies to pay for your singing lessons,

190
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,586
and I will not...

191
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,008
Well, we're back. Or, rather I’m back.
With an empty stage.

192
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,428
Let's take this opportunity
to enjoy the silence.

193
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,599
That’s it! You're on, lad!
Go on, wee man! Break a leg!

194
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:34,938
Right. What have you got for us?
Josh, is it?

195
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,150
- I thought I’d sing a song.
- Well, that's refreshing and new.

196
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,154
- I’ve had a few dancing lessons, too.
- What incredibly useful information.

197
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,574
Thank you. Go ahead.
Steal another two minutes of my life.

I’ve seen a lot of putrid,
revolting, stomach-churning,

216
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,773
horrifically bad acts tonight.

217
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,317
And that was not one of them.

218
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,237
Congratulations, Josh.
You're on to the next round.

219
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,155
We did it! We did it!

220
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,993
Record deal, here we come! You beauty!

221
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,620
I'm gonna be rich! I’m gonna be rich!

222
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,708
Next week, You're The One auditions
are coming to Greendull...

223
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,502
Sorry, that's Greendale.

224
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,422
Dad! Did you hear that?
They’re coming here!

225
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,465
Ηmm? Oh, that's nice, Julian.

226
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,260
And remember, contestants,
this year the grand prize

227
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,513
is a recording contract,
a lifetime supply of Pot Noodles,

228
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,600
and an all-expense paid trip to Italy.
Whoop-DE-doo.

229
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,310
Whoop-DE-doo... What? Hang on.
Did you say Italy?

230
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,021
- That's right, Italy.
- Hold on! I don't have a pen.

231
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,481
And for those of you
in Greendale without pens,

232
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,900
auditions are this Sunday at 5:00.

233
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,777
Sunday at...

234
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,779
5:00.

235
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,533
When the little hand is on the five
and the big hand is straight up!

236
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,368
Got it.

237
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,538
I know I'm the One.
It's time to see if...

238
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,206
You're The One!

239
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,295
If it means a trip to Italy for Sara,
I certainly hope I am the one.

240
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,796
Mmm-hmm!

241
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,550
Right!
Who's hungry for a nice Italian dinner?

242
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,553
I made chicken khakiatore.

243
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,890
- Wow, Mom. That looks like...
- Lt looks amazing, love.

244
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,975
Oh, thank you, dear.

245
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,901
Ah! So, Edwin, my lad,
how are you settling in?

246
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,362
Feeling like part of the SDS family yet?

247
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,616
Now I may be the CEO of the oldest
package delivery service in England,

248
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,703
but I want you to think of me
as your slightly older uncle.

249
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,623
My uncle was eaten by dingos, Mr Βrown.

250
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,583
Really? How strange.

251
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,268
That’s exactly what happened to the man
who used to have your job!

252
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,672
What a bizarre coincidence. Now if I may?

253
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,801
I have noticed SDS employs a lot of people.

254
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,012
Ah, yes. The best part
of running a business.

255
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,807
- Working with people.
- People slow a company down.

256
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,560
SDS does not need people,
it needs machines.

257
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,315
This programmable postman
is 1 0 times faster than a human.

258
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,608
The perfect worker.

259
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,486
This is the future of SDS!

260
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,862
Well, I don't know about that.

261
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,031
I’ve already begun running tests.

262
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,875
I've never been in a film before!
This is very exciting!

263
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:29,089
Ooh! A knock at the door.
What should I do now?

264
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,633
Just answer it
as you usually would.

265
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,010
Hello.

266
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,304
This is your mail. This is your mail.

267
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:42,269
We have had some problems finding
a customer-friendly design for the robots.

268
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,355
Again?

269
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,023
Yes, again.

270
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,151
Do I have to?

271
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,529
If you want your 2 quid, Mother.

272
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,908
Mail!

273
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,164
Delivery! Delivery, old woman! Delivery!

274
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,210
You will accept the fruit basket!
You will accept!

275
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,171
You will accept!

276
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,548
You will accept! You will accept!

277
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,426
That was cash upon delivery!

278
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,514
Uh... Yes. Well, that was,
um, very nice, Edwin.

279
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,476
- Lovely cinematography!
- My point, sir,

280
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,689
is that the UDM 3000
can increase profits 500%.

281
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,233
What, the evil robot?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

282
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,653
I don't think terrifying people
is really the SDS way.

283
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,115
Here, have a lolly from the "good try" jar.

284
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,452
And I’m sure your next idea
will be loads better!

285
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,205
So, let's end the meeting.
I think we've covered everything.

286
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,832
You're The One is on
and I never miss that show.

287
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,086
SDS will use my robots, Mr Βrown.

288
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:54,633
And once they've replaced your postmen,
I’ll replace you.

289
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,639
Come on, Dad. You don't want
to be late for the auditions!

290
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,391
I'm surprised you're doing this, dear.

291
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,478
- You usually hate the spotlight.
- It's not for me, Sara. It's...

292
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,939
It's...

293
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,107
A chance to perform on the telly.

294
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,276
Oh, and what will you be singing?

295
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:17,197
Well, I was wondering, would you mind
terribly if I did our wedding song?

296
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,409
Oh, Pat. That’s so romantic!

297
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,994
Of course I don't mind.

298
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,289
Well, then, I suppose we should get to it.

299
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,959
I wonder if anyone else from town
has heard about the audition.

300
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,341
Around the ragged rocks
the rugged rascal ran. Oh, yes!

301
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,679
Τoro! Τoro! Βessie, why won't you toro?

302
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,849
Once more, from the diaphragm.

303
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:51,231
"Now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this son of York."

304
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,818
Oh, yes, folk have often said
how much I look like Michael Βublé.

305
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,028
No, it's Justin Βieber you want to be.

306
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,614
Isn't it exciting, Pat?

307
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,827
Oh, yes. I suppose. It's very exciting.

308
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,663
- Hi, Pat! Hi, Sara! Hey, Julian!
- Hi, Michael!

309
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,332
♪ Oh, I am the very model
of a modern major-general

310
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,625
♪ I've information vegetable... ♪

311
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,629
I don't care! I am sick of schlepping
from one backwater village to the next,

312
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,425
auditioning tatty country bumpkins
and their amazing musical sheep!

313
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,135
Simon! We're on in five.

314
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,762
Oh, all right. Let's get this over with.

315
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,556
Show me what Grimdale has to offer.

316
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,350
- That’s Greendale, Simon.
- Whatever.

317
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,978
Another wasteland of talentless wannabes.

318
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,147
- Yes?
- I’m Dorothy Τhompson.

319
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,316
And I’m her husband, Alf.
Pleased to meet...

320
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,818
I can't believe I'm actually
meeting you, Simon!

321
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,362
This is the closest
I’ve ever been to a real celebrity.

322
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,073
Well, my second cousin was the national
clog-dancing champion, but he was...

323
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,743
Charming. Are you one of the local judges?

324
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:48,163
Me? On television? Oh, yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

325
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,956
- You're the other judge, then?
- Uh, yes.

326
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,461
Er, certainly. Though I do usually leave
the judging to a higher power.

327
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:59,007
Unless it's a knobbliest knees competition.
Then I’m an expert.

328
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,885
I can never UN-see that.

329
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,100
Oh! Pardon me.

330
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,605
Well, if this is the best they've got,
that recording contract is in the bag.

331
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,190
Was I supposed to bring a bag?

332
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,776
And we are live in 1 5 seconds!

333
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,152
Lights.

334
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,362
Cameras on standby.

335
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,948
Take your seats.
Contestants to the stage, please.

336
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,792
Yes, that's right, line
up right over there.

337
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:25,992
Do we have playback?

338
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,953

00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,109
We're in Green Dill tonight.

Oh! Look at that, Edwin.
One of our team is on the telly.

408
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:52,824
Isn’t that lovely?

409
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,827
A robot would never embarrass
the company like this.

410
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,498
Well, Postman Pat, what will you be
dazzling us with this evening?

411
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:05,003
Well... I thought... I thought I'd sing
my wife Sara's favourite song.

412
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,298
Ooh, I’m all a-tingle.

413
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,633
Uh... So should I just start then?

414

No, I missed my...

I wasn't supposed to... Hang on a minute.

420
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,080
Can I just start again, please?

Please, take your time.

476
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,958
Oh, hello, Mr Carbunkle.
It's Mr Carbunkle.

477
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:58,087

Well, it was just a bit of a laugh.

I hope they don't want
me to quit the contest.

carry on with the show, love.

- Oh, thank you, Sara.

But I’m sure I can explain
it all to Mr Βrown.

for my wife.

00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,771
Well, as I always say,
there's no "I" in team.

497

But why would anyone want these things?

498
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,525
I'm just an ordinary postman.

00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,561
We've already scheduled you
for extra rehearsals,

512
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,854
arranged plenty of personal appearances

513
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,898
and booked you on all the major chat shows.

514
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,901
Mr Carbunkle, I don't think I'll
have the time. My job, you see...

515
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,319
ls already covered.

516
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,999
The Patbot 3000.

517
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:02,169
This mechanical marvel will be
taking over your postal duties.

518
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,463
Temporarily, of course.

519
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,717
You're teasing.
Nobody will really think that's me.

520
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,552
Hello, Pat.
You can count on me.

521
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,346
The special delivery always gets through.
Mission accomplished.

522
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,931
Oh. Perhaps they will.

523
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,685
Of course, you mustn't breathe
a word of this to anyone.

524
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,647
The consequences would be unfortunate.

525
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,567
Yes. Mustn't dilute your
brand, as they say.

526
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,444
♪ Postman Pat... ♪

527
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:30,823
Excuse me, sir, but doesn't this
all seem a bit dishonest?

528
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,243
Pat, think of your friends
at the Sorting Office. Think of Bill.

529
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:35,411
- Βen.
- Whatever.

530
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:40,207
We want to do everything we can to make
sure that office stays open, don't we?

531
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:44,420
Well, I suppose it would be all right
for a little while.

532
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:48,132
Wonderful! Wonderful, lads!
That’s the team spirit!

533
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,135
Excellent, Clifton. Now
here's what we'll do

534
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,348
Meet me tomorrow morning
at the Sorting Office. Come alone.

535
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,069
Just give me a moment, Jess.
I’ll be right back.

536
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,320
Ηmm?

537
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,909
- Mr Carbunkle? Are you here, Mr Carbunkle?
- Clifton.

538
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,994
You're late.

539
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,581
Oh! Yes, I’m sorry. I was helping my son
with his football practice.

540
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,584
This is not a moment to
be late for, Clifton.

541
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:27,922
This is the start of a bold new era
for the Special Delivery Service.

542
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,423
Nice to see you, Pat.

543
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,552
Erm, hello, Patbot. Uh...

544
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,263
Are you sure this is a good idea,
Mr Carbunkle?

545
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,265
He might need someone
to help him on his round.

546
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,684
I have thought of that.

547
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,485
Adorable, isn't he?

548
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,113
Oh, yes. It's very adorable.

549
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,824
Patbot, do you know what to do?

550
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,910
The Patbot 3000 is fully programmed

551
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,663
in all SDS procedures and protocols.

552
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,331
I designed his matrix myself.

553
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,874
Oh, I see.

554
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:08,045
Well, then. Good luck, and remember, the
most important thing for a postman is...

555
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,715
Speed. Efficiency. Ruling the world.

556
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:15,136
Well, I was going to say being friendly.
You know, the human touch.

557
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,945
You are programmed for that, aren't you?

558
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,889
Of course.

559
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:23,269
Patbot, show Clifton how
friendly you can be.

560
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,529
Erm, that's a lot of
teeth, but not exactly...

561
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,240
Time to kick the babies
out of the nest, Clifton.

562
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,159
Oh, erm, well, then...

563
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,662
Let me know if I can be
of any help, Patbot.

564
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,417
- Good morning, Ben. I am Postman Pat.
- Hello, Pat.

565
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,085
I am here to deliver the post

566
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,588
because I am Postman Pat, the postman.

567
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,298
You feeling all right there, mucker?

568
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,092
The special delivery always gets through.
Do not be suspicious.

569
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,552
This is Jess the cat.

570
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,471
Because I am Postman Pat.

571
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,432
Ηmm. OK.

572
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,017
Let me open the door, Ben,

573
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,102
because I am friendly and also nice,

574
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,980
and in no way part of a plot
to take over the SDS

575
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,774
for an evil corporate executive.

576
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,401
Er, been working out, Pat?

577
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,654
No time to chat. We've
got a special delivery.

578
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,407
Get ready for take-off.
Goodbye. Lovely day.

579
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,118
OK. Have a good day, Pat.

580
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:25,039
Everything is ship-shape.
Hello, I am Postman Pat.

581
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,291
Jess the cat, I forgot my postbag.

582
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:32,087
Please get it for me. This is not a trick
to get you out of the van, Jess the cat.

583
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,172
Huh?

584
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,845
We've got a special delivery.

585
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,556
The mission...

586
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,725
There’s no parking in here!

587
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,018
Anytime, anywhere.

588
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,396
My van! Does he have insurance?

589
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,315
Better. He’s under warranty.

590
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,919
- Run for your lives!
- Rise and shine.

591
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,068
He’s gone postal!

592
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,323
I am Postman Pat.
The special delivery always gets through.

593
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,491
Huh?

594
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,326
Mission accomplished.

595
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,453
These roads are inefficient.

596
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,001
Come on, Jess.

597
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,753
Time to go.

598
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,425
Hurry, hurry! We don't want to be late
for Pat's big interview!

599
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,761
London, James, and don't spare the horses.

600
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,560
Hello? Anyone? A little help?

601
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:31,146
To deliver anything,
anytime, anywhere.

602
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,898
Hey. Pat?

603
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,609
- Good morning, Pat!
- Ahhh!

604
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,070
- Oh, my!
- What's wrong with Pat?

605
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,322
The special delivery
always gets through.

606
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,699
- Morning.
- Morning.

607
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,623
I am not evil.
I am only misunderstood.

608
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,160
Stop in the name of the law!

609
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,580
I would like a cup of tea.

610
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,416
I say, that's not like Pat at all.

611
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,711
We should say good morning,
Mrs Goggins.

612
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,170
I am Postman Pat.

613
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,674
Oh, Pat, the Reverend
and I were just saying

614
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,011
how much we enjoyed your
singing last night.

615
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,972
I had an uncle who had
a bonnie set of pipes. He used to...

616
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,600
The special delivery
always gets through.

617
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,020
Goodness me.

618
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,441
Mission accomplished.

619
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,403
- Oh, my! That wasn't like Pat at all.
- Aye!

620
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:23,073
I hope this telly business
isn't too much for the lad.

621
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,457
Good morning, Britain!

622
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:35,586
Today we have two very special guests
I’m sure you'll all recognise.

623
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:41,717
The finalists from You're The One.
It's Postman Pat and Jish.

624
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,010
Jish?

625
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,930
Who is Jish? His name isn't Jish.
His name is...

626
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,765
His name is...

627
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:54,897
Oh! Oh, I’m sorry. I’m allergic to cats.

628
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,569
Marvelous! So, Pat,

629
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,905
how are you enjoying your new celebrity?

630
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,406
Decorated your dressing room yet?

631
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,702
My... No. I don't, uh...
I usually get dressed at home.

632
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,582
Aw! isn’t he scrumptious?

633
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,086
Josh wears clothes! Nearly all the time.
Don't you, Josh?

634
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,963
Yeah. Usually...

635
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,215
Great.

636
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,511
Pat, is it hard to balance working
as a postman with your singing career?

637
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:30,140
Oh, well, I wouldn't call it
a singing career exactly.

638
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,810
Oh, Josh would! Singing
is all he thinks about!

639
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:36,897
Unless it's dancing!
He’s an entertainment machine, that boy!

640
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,524
- Really?
- Any time!

641
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,652
Day or night, he's ready to perform!
Aren't you, Joshy lad?

642
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,322
Pat, your cat's amazing!

643
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,366
He’s already beaten Wilf's high score!

644
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,826
What's his name?

645
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,453
Oh, that's Jess. He’s my best mate.

646
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,248
I really don't think I could get through
the day without him.

647
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,251
- Aw!
- I wish I had a cat.

648
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,670
Well, there you have it, folks.

649
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,048
All it takes to be a star is talent

650
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,925
and a black and white cat!

651
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,095
What? No, no, no! Wait!
You don't need cats! Cats are rubbish!

652
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,307
No, I just meant... I mean...

653
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,852
Don't you wanna hear Josh sing?

654
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,608
And we're out.

655
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,193
Nigel, what did I tell you?

656
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,447
Never book children, authors, or Scotsmen!

657
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,782
- I have bogeys in my hair!
- No, wait!

658
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,952
It's not my fault! It's my allergies.
Please, don't!

659
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,540
Great job, Pat.

660
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,916
Oh, well, thank you.

661
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,877
- You killed them, Pat.
- I did?

662
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,713
- Ls that good?
- Would you like a cappuccino, Mr Clifton?

663
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:46,300
Oh, that's nice of you, thank you.
But I really should be getting home.

664
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,718
My son has football practice.

665
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,679
Oh, of course! Right after
your next interview.

666
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,890
- Next?
- Oh, just a few more.

667
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,726
- People can't get enough of Postman Pat.
- Really?

668
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:01,231
Oh. Well, I suppose we could stay
a bit longer, eh, Jess?

669
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,955
Wonderful job today, me boy.
Well done.

670
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:21,293
- Remember, rehearsals tomorrow.
- I’ll remember. Good night, Mr Βrown.

671
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,892
Sorry I’m so late, love.

672
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,894
I did three interviews!

673
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,098
I really think the people on set liked me.

674
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,274
Pat, I got some calls today.

675
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,860
People said you were acting
strangely on your route.

676
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,487
I was?

677
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,781
Oh, I’ll have to talk to
Mr Carbunkle about that.

678
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,784
Pat, I’m worried about you.

679
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,494
No need, love.

680
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,830
You just concentrate on
planning our Italy trip.

681
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,250
Trust me, love. Everything
will sort itself out.

682
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,883
The whole world's gone bonkers
for this Pat Clifton fellow.

683
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,553
We have to up our game, Joshy boy.

684
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,222
You need to be on fire
at the finals next week.

685
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,182
Charm them! Make them love you!

686
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,351
Mmm-hmm. Charm, love. Got it.

687
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,982
This might sound crazy, but do you hear
someone singing about...

688
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,527
Give me that!

689
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,070
Hey! I was playing that.

690
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,489
I’ll play you, you wee... What?

691
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,493
- He’s got a video game?
- Oh, yeah, it's great, Wilf!

692
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,496
You deliver mail, have a cat
and are nice to people.

693
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,582
Every now and again you can rescue a sheep!

694
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,459
It's the hottest game around.
Totally massive.

695
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,799
I did not pay for your singing lessons,

696
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,178
your dancing lessons
and your hair-care lessons

697
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,598
for you to lose to that... That postman!

698
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,975
Wilf, you know, he's actually pretty good.

699
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,644
I’ll do my best. But how about we just
let the best man win?

700
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:03,937
Best man?

701
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,524
Nobody ever got anywhere
in show business by relying on talent.

702
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,861
I see I’ll have to take matters
into my own hands.

703
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,448
I have been following
that post-hoc performer for a week.

704
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,701
I know everything about him.
When he sleeps. His routes.

705
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,287
The color of his boxer shorts on Tuesdays.

706
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,415
Yeah, that's in no way creepy.

707
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:28,170
I am going to stamp out that postman,
post haste.

708
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,012
Well? How do I look?

709
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,680
What happened to your glasses, dear?

710
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,599
Oh. They’re a lighting problem on the set.

711
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,101
And my makeup assistant says
they make me look a bit dodgy.

712
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,978
I’ve always liked them. Here.

713
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,648
In case you don't get a chance
to eat lunch after work.

714
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:51,276
Ah! Thank you, love. This is so thoughtful.

715
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,863
Oh, I gotta go, Sara. My limo's outside.

716
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:57,449
Don't forget the Τaylors are coming around
for tea tonight.

717
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,784
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

718
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,745
But, Dad, I thought we were going
to practice my football kicks.

719
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,121
My match is this week.

720
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,666
Oh, sorry, Julian. I completely forgot.

721
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,627
I will make time before your big match.
I promise.

722
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,128
Oh, OK.

723
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,297
That’s my boy. I’ll be home early.

724
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,632
Pat! Pat!

725
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,842
Over here! Pat!

726
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,636
Cool! Paparazzi!

727
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,565
Pat, how does it feel
to be everyone's favourite postman?

728
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:21,890
Smile, Jess!

729
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,934
Are the Americans
really making a movie, Pat?

730
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,687
- Have you always loved cats?
- Your fans want to know everything.

731
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,896
What's your inspiration?

732
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,691
Oh. Well, I might be a bit
later than I thought.

733
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,067
Don't be too late, dear.

734
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,820
- The Τaylors are bringing photos from Italy.
- Well, hello.

735
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,029
Hi, how are you?

736
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:07,781
Special delivery.

737
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:51,141
♪ Simple things sing to me

738
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,604

739
00:46:55,855 --> 00:47:00,192

741

Patrick Clifton?

742
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,161
Sara?

743
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,748
Sorry, Pat, baby. I tried to stop her,
but the cat let her in.

744
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,916
Ηmm!

745
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,627
No, it's fine. It's quite all right, Robin.
That’s my wife.

746
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,754
OK, take five, everybody!

747
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,965
Erm, hi, love.

748
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,759
I'm surprised to see you here.

749
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,428
Pat, we need to talk.

750
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:32,349
You don't answer my phone calls.
You get home after midnight.

751
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:36,353
I am sorry, love.
But I have to win this competition.

752
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,480
I wish I could explain.

753
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,358
Can't you try? Please?

754
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,572
Look, I’m doing this show because...

755
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,616
I hope I'm not interrupting.

756
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,120
Pat, Mr Βrown needs to see you.
Immediately.

757
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,789
I’ll be right back, love.

758
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,460
- Mr Βrown, you wanted to see me?
- I did?

759
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,379
- Oh, I did, I did.
- Sara, is it?

760
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:06,758
I know you want to support your husband.
We all do.

761
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:10,679
- But coming here was a bad idea.
- Lt was?

762
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,432
Well, he wouldn't say it,
but this means a lot to him.

763
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,309
I'm sure you understand.

764
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,229
Pat needs to focus on his performance.

765
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,566
No demands. No distractions.

766
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:27,529
You do want your husband
to be happy, don't you?

767
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,499
Pat! Pat!
Could I have your autograph?

768
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,933
- Oh. Er, yes.
- I’m such a big fan.

769
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:35,245
Well, it seems like this is what he wants.

770
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,581
Yes, it is.

771
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:42,168
I know it's difficult, but sometimes
when you really love someone,

772
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,588
the best thing you can do

773
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,257
is to let them go.

774
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,222
Good news, Pat. I’ve invited all of
Greendale to the You're The One finals.

775
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,475
Front row seats!
Compliments of your SDS family!

776
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,228
Thank you, sir.
I'm sure everyone will appreciate it.

777
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:03,398
No trouble at all, my boy.
You are doing great things for the company.

778
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,359
It's like my Great Uncle
Thaddeus used to say,

779
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,903
- "It's all about the human touch."
- Yes, yes. Very true.

780
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,864
Could you excuse me, sir? I need to go.

781
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,075
- Of course, my boy.
- No rest for the weary, eh?

782
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,286
Mr Carbunkle, where's Sara?

783
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,663
- She was just here.
- I don't know.

784
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:21,458
- - Well, she did say
she had other things to do.

785
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:22,959
Mmm!

786
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,003
You know how women are.

787
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,214
Don't worry, Pat.
Once you take her on that trip to Italy,

788
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,967
she'll realise this was all for her.

789
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,969
Ηmm. I suppose.

790
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:34,638
- If I win.
- If?

791
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:39,059
You know
we're all behind you 1 00%.

792
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,436
Lose the cat.

793
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,341
Jess? Oi, Jess.

794
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,137
I see you're not with Dad either.

795
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:20,308
Seems like he doesn't have much time for us
since he got famous.

796
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,241
I thought I’d drop by the Sorting Office.

797
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,271
Maybe see if he had time
for a chat or some footie.

798
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,482
You want to come along?

799
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:36,032
Lt looks like everyone in town is here.

800
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:38,034
I wonder what's going on, Jess.

801
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,453
Βen, you've just got
to do something about Pat!

802
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:43,123
He poured cement over my rose garden
and all he said was,

803
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,126
"Faster route. Lovely day.
I am not a robot."

804
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,877
He was downright rude to me.

805
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,296
He has been flagrantly
disregarding traffic laws.

806
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,715
Oh, something's the matter with him.

807
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,550
He’s not acting like Pat at all.

808
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,009
He’s really getting up my nerves!

809
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,929
It's the celebrity. It's gone to his head.

810
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:02,100
Look, I know he's been a bit off lately,
but this is Pat we're talking about.

811
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,144
He’d never let us down on purpose.

812
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,272
To forgive is divine.

813
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,898
Tell that to my petunias.

814
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,900
Pat's under a lot of pressure.

815
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:14,446
I'm sure he'll be back to normal
once this telly business blows over.

816
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,074
What touching loyalty!
Don't you think, Pat?

817
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,492
Mr Carbunkle.

818
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:20,857
Are you here with more upgrades?

819
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,953
You could say that.

820
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,413
Let's step into my office.

821
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,583
It's not your office any more, Τaylor.

822
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,834
You're fired.

823
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,796
- You're replacing me?
- With Pat.

824
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:35,175
His delivery times are the quickest
SDS has ever seen.

825
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,510
He is the postman of the future!

826
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,430
Pat, you're not going
along with this, are you?

827
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:45,685
Clean out your office, Ben.
I want you off the premises in 1 0 minutes.

828
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,355
You won't have to wait that long, Pat.

829
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,982
Come on, Lauren, we're leaving.

830
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,778
And you may as well take
your ex-employees with you.

831
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,905
I can't believe it.

832
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,656
I used too much toilet paper.

833
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,868
- Pat, you don't mean it.
- Pat, how could you?

834
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,661
Oh! That was uncalled for!

835
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:07,707
Madam, this is private property
and you are trespassing.

836
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,251
Shall I ring someone to show you out?

837
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,962
Oh! Well, I never did.

838
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,548
I’d never have believed it of Pat.

839
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,884
That Pat has turned
into a real stinker.

840
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,552
He certainly has.

841
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,596
Dad, you can't do this.

842
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,807
Βen is your best friend.

843
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:24,933
You've always told me

844
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,603
the most important things in the world
are friends and family.

845
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,771
Didn't you mean it?

846
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:36,152
The most important things in the world
are efficiency, profit, success.

847
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,696
- Dad?
- You heard your father.

848
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:41,032
Now, why don't you run along?

849
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,325
And take that with you.

850
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,087
Robots, report for duty!

851
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,006
We're taking over this operation.

852
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:58,633
At last!

853
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,929
No more inefficient humans
cluttering up my mailroom!

854
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,474
Now that everyone loves Postman Pat,
they'll turn a blind eye

855
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,811
as I replace every deliveryman
in the Special Delivery Service

856
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,022
with my glorious, money-making machines!

857
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,359
Profits will skyrocket!

858
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,988
The board of directors will retire
that weak-kneed Βrown

859
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,740
and promote me to CEO!

860
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,826
And I won't stop there!

861
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,870
We'll diversify into other businesses.

862
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:28,955
We'll make automated bank tellers,

863
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,832
robotic technical support,

864
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,543
even computer-animated movies!

865
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,464
Fly, my pretties! Fly! Fly!

866
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:42,051
Today, England! Tomorrow, the world!

867
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,397
Sara! Julian! Our lift's here!

868
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,425
Is everyone ready to go to London?

869
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,070
We're not coming.

870
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:02,989
Not coming?

871
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,159
But this is the final competition.

872
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,746
Julian, you don't want
to miss this, do you?

873
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,874
Good luck, Dad. I hope you win.

874
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,878
Son?

875
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:20,887
What's the matter with Julian?
I thought he was looking forward to this.

876
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,886
We just...
We just don't want to get in your way.

877
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,931
I'm sure you'll do really well

878
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,308
without us.

879
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,645
- Good luck.
- Sara?

880
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,940
Sara? But I don't...

881
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,778
All right, I’ll be home after.

882
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:58,711
Well, I suppose it's just
you and me then, Jess.

883
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,797
Mmm-mmm!

884
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,300
Jess?

885
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,427
Jess!

886
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,360
Uh, yes. Yes, yes. Oh.

887
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,322
Well, yes. I’ll tell him.
Uh, thank you.

888
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,993
It's the strangest thing, Pat.

889
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,454
Nobody from Greendale wanted the tickets
I sent them.

890
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,622
Oh.

891
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,710
Cheer up, my boy!

892
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,546
SDS loves the publicity you've given us.

893
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,923
You've a lot to be proud of.

894
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,051
You should be a very happy man.

895
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,315
Hello, Ben. I am Postman Pat.

896
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,692
I would love a cup of tea.

897
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,110
It's all right for you, isn't it?

898
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,613
The special delivery
always gets through.

899
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,073
- Hello, Ben.
- Eh?

900
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,241
Am I seeing things?

901
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,209
- I am Postman Pat.
- I am also Postman Pat.

902
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,712
- Have a good day.
- The special delivery always gets...

903
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,049
All right, there is definitely
something funny going on around here!

904
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:39,228
To deliver anything anytime, anywhere.

905
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,731
We've got to... Delivery. Efficiency.

906
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:45,276
To deliver anything anytime,
anywhere. Rise and shine.

907
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,528
We've got to... Delivery. Efficiency.

908
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:50,698
Hop on, Jess! We'll get
to the bottom of this.

909
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,993
- I am Postman Pat.
- I am also Postman Pat.

910
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,706
- I am Postman Pat.
- Anytime, anywhere...

911
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,958
A special delivery.
Yes, I would love a cup of tea.

912
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,461
Efficiency, profitability.

913
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,464
Rise and shine. We've got to... Delivery.
Efficiency.

914
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,468
All right, ya pestilent postie.

915
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,054
I'm gonna return you to sender.

916
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,600
We've got a special delivery. Hello.

917
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:22,063
Ah, why not?

918
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,400
You should have stuck to letters, Pat!

919
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:29,946
You need to be willing to stop at nothing
to make it in showbiz!

920
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,823
I learned that from Hannah Montana.

921
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:35,118
See how well you sing
from inside a box, you little...

922
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,702
Eh?

923
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,788
No! That’s not possible!

924
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,624
Hello.

925
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,376
What? Lt can't be!

926
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,086
Do not run in terror.

927
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,339
The special delivery
values customer satisfaction.

928
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,011
- Stay away from me! Get back, you hear?
- Efficient. Efficient. Efficient.

929
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,306
Would you like a stamp?

930
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,933
I said get back!

931
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,185
I'm warning you!

932
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,570
♪ Daisy, Daisy

933
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:16,284
♪ Give me your answer, do ♪

934
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,828
Jings, crivens and help ma boab!

935
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,204
He’s a robot.

936
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,666
But if Pat's been replaced
by robots, then...

937
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,502
I have to talk to Sara!

938
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,797
The magnet turned him off.

939
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,010
System rebooting. Alert! Alert!

940
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,929
Cover blown. Recall protocols initiated.

941
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:40,141
Return to Carbunkle. Return to Carbunkle.

942
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,019
Cover blown. Cover blown. Alert! Alert!

943
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:47,857
Oh, no, Pat! Ya won't get away that easy!

944
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,487
Recall protocols initiated.
Return to Carbunkle.

945
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,701
Cover blown. Cover blown.

946
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,745
Cover blown. Alert! Alert!

947
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,955
- Recall protocols initiated.
- Huh?

948
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,541
Return to Carbunkle.

949
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,460
Return to Carbunkle.

950
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,795
Carbunkle. Carbunkle. Carbunkle.

951
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:13,049
This is just too good to be true!

952
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:15,218
Postman Pat's a cheat!

953
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,221
Robots can't enter talent competitions!

954
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,308
I win! I win!

955
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:32,193
And it seems all of England is tuning in
tonight to watch the You're The One finals.

956
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,237
Excitement at the theater is high

957
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:39,075
as crowds await the arrival
of media sensation Postman Pat!

958
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,245
Oh! And here he is now!

959
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,547
- I love you, Pat!
- Over here!

960
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,669
Oh, hi, Pat. Where's Jess?

961
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,588
Uh, he, uh... He isn't coming.

962
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,424
Hey, are you OK, mate?

963
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,634
I don't know.

964
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,386
I love you, Pat!

965
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,931
Josh! Just one on the cheek!

966
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,270
Good luck tonight, Pat.

967
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,940
Break a leg, Pat!

968
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,984
Knock 'em dead, Patty.

969
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,146
I don't feel like a very happy man.

970
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,190
Something the matter, Pat?

971
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,734
Oh, Mr Carbunkle.

972
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,154
Well, it's just...

973
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:01,741
This all feels like a mistake.
I'm not a performer.

974
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,701
I'm a postman.

975
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,036
I should talk to Mr Βrown.

976
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,287
Oh, no.

977
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,581
You're not ruining this now.

978
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,876
I’ve finally got that fool of a CEO
where I want him.

979
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:16,714
If it were up to him, SDS would stay
a quaint little delivery service

980
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:21,927
dedicated to customer service
and the human touch.

981
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,012
Βlech!

982
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,474
But I thought that's what all this was for,

983
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:29,018
to help keep SDS the way it's always been.

984
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:33,856
Your publicity was to make people love
Postman Pat.

985
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:39,737
Now, I can replace
all of SDS's human workers with Patbots!

986
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:41,864
And when I become CEO,

987
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:47,161
SDS will become the biggest,
most profitable company in the world!

988
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,038
No. No!

989
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,706
I won't go along with that!

990
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,167
Sorry, Pat, didn't I mention?

991
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,711
I don't need you any more, either.

992
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,036
What do you mean by...

993
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,381
- Hello, Pat.
- Oh!

994
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:02,927
You can count on me.
The special delivery always gets through.

995
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:05,346
Mission accomplished.

996
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:11,394
Nice working with you, Pat.

997
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,437
No, wait, don't! Oi!

998
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:18,734
Hey! You can't do this! Let me out!
Let me out!

999
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,789
What have I done?

1000
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:36,127
I’ve given up everything and everyone
who cared about me for this.

1001
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,672
And I don't even recognise myself any more.

1002
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,758
Oh, I’ve been such a fool.

1003
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,480
Jess?

1004
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,569
Jess!

1005
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,880
Um, attention.

1006
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,550
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

1007
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,077
Now just shush!

1008
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:12,538
Ηmm!

1009
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,583
Thank you for gathering
on such short notice.

1010
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:19,295
Look, I know you've all been upset
with Pat's behaviour lately.

1011
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,839
Upset? He traumatized my sheep!

1012
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:26,677
Yeah, but that wasn't Pat!

1013
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:31,432
The thing that's been delivering mail
this past week is a robot!

1014
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,131
- A robot?
- That’s not possible.

1015
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:35,644
Pat always seemed human.

1016
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:39,565
Come to think of it,
that does explain his cat leaking oil.

1017
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,484
And his flouting of the law.

1018
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,653
I know everyone's been angry at Dad lately.

1019
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,406
Seems like he's been too
busy for any of us.

1020
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,533
But Dad's helped us loads of times.

1021
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:51,327
Remember when he hoed your field, Alf?

1022
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,829
Aye, aye. That I do.

1023
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,499
He brought our Lizzy
soup when she was sick.

1024
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,917
He always gives to charity.

1025
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,043
He picked my berries.

1026
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,461
He’s my best friend.

1027
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:02,505
I’ve been such a fool!

1028
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,841
Pat's always been there for us.

1029
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:09,136
And now it's time for
us to be there for him!

1030
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:10,513
So who's with me?

1031
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:04,567
This is it.

1032
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,068
We are finally here.

1033
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,486
Our season finale,

1034
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:11,824
where the top contestants test their
talents in a battle to be the best.

1035
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,243
And this time, I actually care.

1036
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,329
I know I’m the One. It's time to see if...

1037
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,415
You're The One!

1038
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,503
There you are, Edwin.
I thought you might miss the show.

1039
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,046
No, Mr Βrown.

1040
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,341
I just had some
last-minute business to attend to.

1041
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:33,887
Our first contestant is a fan favourite
who's new to showbiz.

1042
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,348
The postie with the mostie.

1043
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,808

Well, he's changed his

1052
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,305
Change for the better, Mr Βrown.

1053
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,307
The first of many.

1054
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,893
No one can stop me now.

1055
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:26,649
Ready to go, Jess?

1056
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,778
Come on then. We've got to stop that show!

1057
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:35,342
Where do you think you're going, pally?

1058
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,575
I need to get in there.

1059
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,785
We're sold out.

1060
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,578
Postman Pat's appearing tonight.

1061
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,413
Yes, I know. But he's not...

1062
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,707
I mean, I'm Postman Pat.

1063
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,377
- You and everybody else.
- Huh?

1064
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:47,503
Nice try.

1065
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:48,671
Homemade costume?

1066
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,964
He don't look anything like a postman.

1067
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,595
Uh-oh.

1068
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,142
Oh! No, I... I can see there's a queue.

1069
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:03,602
And we don't want...

1070
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:04,687
Leg it, Jess!

1071
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,481
This way!

1072
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,028
More Patbots?

1073
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:15,114
Carbunkle isn't taking any chances.

1074
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,282
What do we do now, Jess?
We have to get inside!

1075
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,162
Manoeuvre 1 7?

1076
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,376

Oh, my giddy aunt!

1080
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:57,656
He’s blasting the bolts!

1081
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,616
We need to get to the top, Jess!

1082
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,121
Whoa!

1083
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,583
Quick, Jess! Jump!

1084
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,424

Listen to me, you ferrous feline.

getting into this theater,

1091
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:50,918
I’ll have you replaced
by a radio-controlled poodle!

1092
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,220
Well, that looks sturdy enough.

1093
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,180
Okay, Jess. Follow me.

1094
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,895
Carefully. Carefully now.

1095
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,272
Almost there.

1096
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,820
Oh, muffins.

1097
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,656
Ahhh!

1098
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,660
Oh, hello.

Whoa!

1102
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:02,614
Hang on, Jess. I’m coming.

1103
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,662
- I have not put on weight.
- Ηmm.

1104
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,303
Hey, we did it, Jess!

1105
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,349
Jess, I’d say we're home and dry now.

1106
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:32,728
Uh-oh!

1107
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,731
Ahhh!

1108
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,357
Jess! Run!

1109
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,623
That was close.

1110
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,250
Uh-huh!

1111
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:03,342
Jess! Look over there. It's a way in.

1112
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,302
Come on, Jess, let's go.

Uh-oh!

Ooh! That was a bit of luck.

Oh, just out of reach.

1119
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,352
If I can just... Whoa!

1120
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,398

This contest is a sham.

1136
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:45,861
And this postman isn't
what he pretends to be.

1137
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:49,114
Postman Pat is a robot!

1138
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,243
And I can prove it.

1139
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,635
That is a robot!

1140
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,971
He’s got bits in him!

Robots aren't allowed on the show.

I told you.

01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,061
What is going on here?

1144
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,563
Edwin, I demand an explanation!

1145
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,482
It must be Clifton's doing, sir.

1146
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:25,192
He’s fooled us all. He’s a cheat.

1147
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,069
No, everybody wait, please!

1148
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,154
I can explain everything!

1149
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,410
Mr Βrown, sir.

1150
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:38,330
I'm afraid we've both
made a terrible mistake.

1151
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,248
Ah, it's just another robot!

1152
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,542
I’ll make short work of...

1153
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:44,628
Hey, wait a minute.

1154
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:47,547
Lt was working a minute ago.
This is some kind of trick.

1155
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,676
There’s a lot of metal above my head,
isn't there?

1156
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,053
Yes.

1157
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,179
I thought so.

1158
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,683
You can't fool me! Robots!

1159
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,435
You're all robots!

1160
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,355
Simon's a robot, too, I’m sure of it.
He’s always been a robot.

1161
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,566
Pat, my boy. I don't
understand any of this.

1162
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,235
What's going on?

1163
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,404
It's so easy to lose sight
of what's important.

1164
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:15,200
Everything seems to be moving
so quickly these days.

1165
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,202
Technology and machines

1166
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,788
have brought a lot of wonderful things
into the world.

1167
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,457
Made it faster, more exciting.

1168
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:25,544
And being on telly, well,
that's quite a thrill.

1169
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:29,339
But so is slowing down
to play football with your son.

1170
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,884
Or coming home to a quiet dinner
with family and friends.

1171
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:36,221
I got into this contest
to win a holiday for my wife,

1172
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:40,100
but somewhere along the way
I forgot to take time

1173
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,394
for those I really care about.

1174
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,271
And that was a mistake.

1175
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:48,441
Because if the people you love
aren't there to share your success,

1176
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:52,279
then maybe you're not
that successful at all.

1177
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,490
You'd think a postman would be better
at sorting things, wouldn't you?

1178
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:59,202
I want to be a postman.

1179
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,082
Good on you, mate.

1180
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,127
Oh. I must have something in my eye.

1181
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:08,795
I’ve wasted my life.

1182
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,342
But not everyone at our company
feels the same way.

1183
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,344
Isn't that right, Mr Carbunkle?

1184
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,263
Quite right, Clifton.

1185
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:22,309
What matters is money.
And control! And power!

1186
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:26,521
Everything SDS will have,
once I’m running this sorry company!

1187
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,774
No, no, no, no, Edwin.
That’s not the SDS way.

1188
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,902
It is now.

1189
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:45,040
See? See? Robots! I knew it! Robots!

1190
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,305
Edwin, stop this immediately!

1191
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,473
What are you doing?

1192
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,391
Give me the, SDS, Βrown.

1193
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:07,938
The days of lovable, friendly mailmen
helping quaint country characters

1194
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:11,691
with their stupid little problems is over!

1195
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:14,361
The future belongs to machines!

1196
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,904
And to me!

1197
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:28,500
See? See? I told you this would happen!

1198
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,419
Oh, if I was down there,
I'd show you what for!

1199
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,838
Come up here and fight like a machine!

1200
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,924
Oh! Oh, my allergy!

1201
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,769
Huh?

1202
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,204
- What happened?
- They all stopped.

1203
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,292
Please. Easiest game ever.

1204
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:15,547
Huh?

1205
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,301
I'm so sorry, Pat.

1206
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:22,679
I had no idea what Edwin was up to.

1207
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,180
The Special Delivery Service

1208
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:27,309
would never replace
wonderful fellows like you.

1209
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:31,313
After all, it's the human
touch that makes us a family.

1210
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:35,442
But this wasn't just me!
There’s no "I" in team, remember?

1211
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:39,362
Yes, but there is a "you" in you are fired!

1212
01:17:39,447 --> 01:17:41,239
You can't do this to me!

1213
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,742
I am the future! I’ll just move to America!

1214
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,243
I'm not even a bad guy there!

1215
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,245
You'll see, I’ll be back!

1216
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:50,332
I’ll be back! I’ll be back!

1217
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,750
Nobody understands genius!

1218
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,210
I’ve seen boiled hams that are less done.

1219
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:58,340
So if the melodrama is over,
can we get back to the reality show?

1220
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:02,135
Postman Pat,
the whole world is waiting for you to sing.

1221
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,764
Actually, I only got into this
to win my wife a holiday.

1222
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,266
And without her to sing for,

1223
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:09,601
well, I’m sorry.

1224
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,770
There’s really no point in me...

1225
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:14,189
- Pat.
- Huh?

1226
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,315
Pat.

1227
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,454
Go for it, Pat!

1228
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,839
Looks like you've got something
to sing for now, mate.

1229
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:40,924
Doesn't he, Wilf?

1230
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,927
Aye. Well, may the best man win.

1231
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:47,639
And if you're ever looking for a
manager, Pat, give me a wee call.

1232
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,057
How about it, Pat?

1233
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,643
Well, Jess? What do you think?

1234
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,311
Uh-huh!

1235
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:54,938
All right, Simon.

1236
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:56,689
But I may change the act a bit.
