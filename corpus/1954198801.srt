Moment, wait.
Since someone else is talking out of you, huh?

The cops have sealed it.

105
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,697

00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,951
In this room here.
Just in this one.

00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,786
I do not know what this is?
But I put that shit ends here.

114
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,754

125
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,795
No?

126
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,754
Non-existent.

127
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,759
You have the little folded,
without asking?

128
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,803
She did not talk, Eli.

129
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,816
Do you think now she's talking about, you pea brain?

130
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,866
Get the mosquitoes. - I will.

131
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,867
Get the mosquitoes!

Yes?
Or yes, sunshine?

134
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,219
Eli, the woman wanted me to ...

135
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:39,028
That was fucking stupid of you,
recklessly and amateurish.

136
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:45,914
Now to listen to justify you,
pull off and get me my money back!

137
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,922
So good.

138
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,001
Now let us
first thing to go feed.

139
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,499
Hey, he's back.

140
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,546
Are you feeling better champion?
Again HQ dam?

141
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,382
I do not know, man.

142
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,589
Thank you.

143
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,176
Do you say it to me.

144
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,390
I mean, I'm dreaming?

145
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,379
Last night I was
with my dream wife.

146
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,436
The perfect woman.

147
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,151
This was the perfect night, Lord God.

148
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,512
Finally.

149
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,364
And now you tell me

150
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,235
that she was already dead,
before this happened?

151
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,771
I do not understand
why do you say that again and again.

152
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,149
Quite seriously. Do you hear please on it.
You're making really finished.

153
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,112
Do not tell me you were with her.
- Damn it, I was with her!

154
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,464
I do not spider yet.

155
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,867
It is perhaps only
one of your dream stories

156
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,328
you already had in college,
do you remember?

157
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,582
The difference between dreams
and reality disappears with you.

158
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,639
There are not just dreams, okay?

159
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,922
I have premonitions.
- Premonitions? - Visions.

160
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,309
Maybe it was a vision? - No ...

161
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,987
It was not. That was ...
- That was her spirit.

162
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,533
Oh, my God,
you were with her ​​mind.

163
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,892
Nonsense.
- She was not ready to die.

164
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,769
Maybe they had to
and bring to an end,

165
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,872
what they started for Leanne.

166
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,526
Second. What?
Hang on, how do you mean?

167
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,279
Do not listen to Andrea,
it has a small shot.

168
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,365
No, ye do not understand?
So it has been.

169
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,368
No, it was not a ghost.
So what does not exist.

170
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:08,456
Do not tell me what it is or not.
Not after that night. Let them talk.

171
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,541
Go on. It's okay.

172
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:14,271
Please. I want to know from you,
how you meant that.

173
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,519
Red on.

174
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,853
Tell me everything. Okay?

175
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,897
Please.

176
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,975
Leanne.
Leanne was her sister.

177
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,812
And she has ...
No, she had this friend, this ...

178
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,690
Terry Jo, a madman.
A drug dealer.

179
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,276
So one who everywhere here
sold on the streets of drugs.

180
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,069
And outside in desert places.

181
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,947
In the beginning it was just pot,
but then was it Meth

182
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,300
And Leanne has started
to take it, okay?

183
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,261
Eventually Terry Jo was
you just overdosed and they ...

184
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,845
She died in it?

185
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,754
Yes. And Monika had tried
her away from it.

186
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,858
From the fabric and Terry Jo,
but it was too late.

187
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:05,739
When she learned what Leanne
had happened, what had happened to her ...

188
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,210
A week earlier,
a week before her death,

189
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,964
Leanne was with Monika
and told of a big drug deal

190
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,675
the Terry Jo
should settle for his boss Eli.

191
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,136
So a crazy Englishman,
of like a cowboy lists.

192
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,056
Terry Jo babbles
interruption of this deal,

193
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,351
to the eleven forty-five
scheduled to depart at the Mann Street.

194
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,270
Is supposed to be a bombastic deal.

195
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,481
She knew the place and time,
because he's told her time after sex.

196
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:02,587
Eleven forty-five. Did it said a thousand times,
over and over again.

197
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,989
Tuesday at eleven forty-five
at the Mann Street.

198
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,575
Whenever he had sex,
he had a big mouth.

199
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:11,412
He trusts me to the cause.
Me! Eli trusts me to the cause.

200
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,622
He has described her everything minutely.

201
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,875
135 thousand.
Do you know how much food that is?

202
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,059
He was like a little boy.
- You know what? This is so much material.

203
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,849
This Monika knew
and she wanted Terry Jo do.

204
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,678
Her father was in Vietnam
in a special unit

205
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,406
and after a long police officer
near Vegas.

206
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,699
She found pleasure in the shooting.
He taught her everything.

207
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,879
She had nothing against
and not afraid of anyone.

208
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,744
So sets out to the guys
surprise at the place of delivery.

209
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,205
Terry Jo's been there before,
but to pee times.

210
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,557
I'll go piss.

211
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,691
Monika has not notice anything
and runs through the thing.

212
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,369
Oh shit.

213
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,667
Oh God! Fuck!

214
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,720
She sees no Terry Jo.
- Shit.

215
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,807
But finds the money for it.

216
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,105
Then appeared on the other cars.

217
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,576
When Terry Jo comes to the car,
are all dead and the money is gone.

218
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,082
Fuck!

219
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,044
Fuck! Shit!

220
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,708
Fuck!

221
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,623
Cursed.

222
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,761
Terry Jo had to Eli
and confess to him what happened.

223
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,059
What?

224
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:32,195
135 one thousand U.S. dollars
is a heap of coal for people like us.

225
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,953
But there was something
the Monika did not know.

226
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,777
And that is, Terry Jo a few days
previously Leanne as a Hi-Tech Smartphone

227
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,629
had a birthday.

228
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:56,094
In which they had all the names
Phone numbers and addresses stored.

229
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,944
Eli tear your ass up when we
can not find the money. - Shut up.

230
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,912
And then you showed up.

231
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,248
I need to get some fresh air.
Get out of the room.

232
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,168
Get out of this town.
I can not stand it here any longer.

233
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,429
Wait a minute.

234
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,766
Do you think she's still alive?

235
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,939
Not alive and not dead

236
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,948
What are you doing?
It reported to the cops?

237
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,683
I do not know, man.

238
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,662
Should I Report,
I fucked a dead? Yes?

239
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,857
I can not now.

240
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,994
I am sometimes away for a while.

241
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,476
How's it going?

242
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,976
Can we please go to the city?

243
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,856
I want to go dancing and have a drink.

244
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,230
Dancing.

245
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,803
You want to go dancing?

246
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:25,069
Okay. Then let me have fast
the stinking waste rausbringen.

247
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,580
Well, and then we go?
- Then we go dancing.

248
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,275
All right, let's ...

249
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,236
Double JayJay? Wow.

250
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,864
Really great, what are you doing.

251
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,998
The mess I'm sorry, man.

252
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,847
Where is my cash, you starlet?

253
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,514
Fuck you in the ass.

254
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,856
You make me beforehand before but,
how to do this, okay?

255
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,744
It's beautiful here, is not it?

256
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,859
We can thus no longer meet.

257
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,120
Oh no?

258
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,239
So is a figure of speech.

259
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,752
Yes, I've heard that before.
Not a nice phrase.

260
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,675
You have to tell me what's going on.
I have no idea.

261
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,711
I just little.
I can not remember anything more.

262
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,815
At anything? - What was it.

263
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,393
What was what? - What was for you.

264
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:29,784
I saw both of us.
And something that has not happened yet.

265
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,728
What does that mean?

266
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,896
It means that I see things.

267
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,033
Does that mean you have visions?

268
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,443
Something like that.

269
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,001
I have premonitions, probably.

270
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,337
I have both, you know?

271
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,175
I dream things as well.
Really hard.

272
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,291
And I do not know
how to arrange everything.

273
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,002
Maybe we can help each other.

274
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,356
I want to know
what has happened in the past.

275
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,690
And what do I do?
- Sounds like you'd have to forget it.

276
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,194
Yes.

277
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:14,158
They say that you were dead.
Assassinated would.

278
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,581
This seems to be the case.

279
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,290
But I'm not a ghost.

280
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,835
People talk to me, take me.

281
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,719
Are you undead?

282
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,672
Looks like it.

283
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,685
I'm probably because of them still there.
Because of my sister.

284
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,690
I want to accomplish,
what I started.

285
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,777
She was with the wrong people.

286
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,279
You'll tell me,
where the stupid money is.

287
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,200
Because I know
she betrayed it to her stupid girlfriend.

288
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,554
And I know that their
stupid girlfriend has told you.

289
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,217
If not you tell me

290
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:32,323
then I'll break more ribs,
until you no longer have unbroken.

291
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,027
And there is no more to break, ...

292
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:44,276
Then ... I'll make you your pretty
Cheap Movie Actors face a,

293
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,504
to even it there is nothing left.

294
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,551
No, that's good, wait.

295
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,470
I'm telling you.

296
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,558
You can even ask Monika.

297
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,023
Namely, it is still alive.

298
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:12,971
I swear.

299
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,806
I swear to God.

300
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,160
My Best Friend
has it namely fucked last night.

301
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,415
Toll.

302
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,544
Last chance starlet.

303
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,648
I told you,
fuck yourself in the ass.

304
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,813
Our friends are perhaps in danger.

305
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,557
Why?
- Because everyone who knows anything, is in danger.

306
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,726
These guys are fucking dangerous.

307
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,329
Believe me, I know.
They killed Leanne.

308
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,234
We were both adventurous,
but I was more after my father.

309
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:11,112
I had his self-control,
which stemmed from his professional

310
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,698
and from which,
what he had been through during the war.

311
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:18,679
Leanne was younger, and discipline is something
the Younger always less understand.

312
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,173
She began to take drugs.

313
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:26,378
And that was more important to them over time
when our family or college.

314
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,018
I wanted to take her away from it.
You have held like an animal.

315
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,971
Already clear.

316
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,354
Hey, boss!
Hello? Over here.

317
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,190
What für'n drink do you want?
- Two beer, okay?

318
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,191
Here.

319
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,498
From what kind of a neighborhood you come from?

320
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,086
I'll be right with you, boss.

321
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,844
What can I do for you?

322
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,255
How about a Tequila?

323
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,937
Blanco, only the finest.

324
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,060
Coming right up.

325
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,155
Salt, lemon?

326
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,740
Without.

327
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,573
Hello!

328
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,164
Do not run away,
I need another one, yes?

329
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,630
You want to know's what?

330
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,338
Something like that.

331
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,536
Not enough. One more.

332
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,550
Sure, partner. The whole night.
We have the whole night.

333
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,260
Please.

334
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,612
One more.

335
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,585
An even more.

336
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,888
Por favor, Master.

337
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,611
<i> now you've found me after all. </ i>

338
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,364
Monika.

339
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,529
<i> Holy shit. </ i>

340
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,785
<i> I need a drink. </ i>

341
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,204
<i> Monika </ i>

342
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,750
I still want to have one, please!

343
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,503
One more of this stuff here.

344
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,051
What's the magic word?
- How about now?

345
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,832
You know what?
Now we're through here.

346
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,959
I am far from through here.
- Yes, you are.

347
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,378
You know exactly
I'm not done yet.

348
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:59,392
Because I know that you
anyone a glass fail, right?

349
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,719
When I was here yesterday
I've been drinking a lot more,

350
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,607
and you always have beautiful
nachgekippt, my friend.

351
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,475
What are you talking the hell?

352
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:12,896
I'm talking about you last night
have given me a lot more.

353
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,689
Of this I red, my friend.

354
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,650
What is this nonsense?
I've never seen in my life.

355
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,707
And I remember all faces.

356
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,167
Nonsense!

357
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,304
Pour me another one, asshole!

358
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,638
Stop it. You have just
Booked your flight home, pal.

359
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:34,893
Melvin!

360
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,742
Monika?

361
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,254
Where are you?

362
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,774
Double.

363
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,524
Boy, did you leave the door.

364
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,200
Oh, my God.

365
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,373
Oh, my God.

366
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,464
Double.

367
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,629
This is not true.

368
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,728
What's going on because, cursed?

369
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,471
You do not want a lawyer?
- No, I do not want a lawyer.

370
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,391
Since when have you been
because even here at the motel?

371
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,073
Since Monday.

372
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,492
Do you know Mr JayJay long?

373
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,958
My dear, long lifetime. Okay?

374
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:23,790
Yes?

375
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,126
What about Andrea? - Hardly known.

376
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,338
Do you know Monika Lana?

377
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,050
No.

378
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,206
The answer came late, huh?

379
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,418
Man, the answer came late,
because I had to think of something.

380
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,128
Oh yeah? What, please?

381
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,435
That she was killed.
My God!

382
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:48,843
Where are your driver's license,
Your wallet and your return ticket?

383
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,887
Everything in my backpack.

384
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:54,071
Who is Double? - JayJay.
- Where is your backpack?

385
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,828
The thing have stolen, as I said.

386
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,522
Who has stolen?
- That I have to say a thousand times.

387
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,750
That asshole of Terry Jo's it!

388
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,170
Let's be calm.

389
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,549
Do you have a cell phone case? - Yes.

390
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,460
May I, indeed?

391
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:24,587
Nothing since your arrival? - No. Double is
anyway the only one who called me.

392
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,507
How did he get the name?
- Two Jays.

393
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,258
How ... What ...

394
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:33,429
How, how, what?
JayJay. Two Jays stupid, man!

395
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,907
Hey!
Calm down, you hothead.

396
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,865
Again to Mr "two stupid Jays".
Who is that?

397
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,539
Jason Johnson. Nothing?

398
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,881
JayJay Johnson.

399
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,418
As the actor?

400
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,414
Oh, my God. Yes, exactly.

401
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:03,001
Can you tell me what he was
willed in this shithole?

402
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,462
I do not know, man.
He did such a shitty descent.

403
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,631
He had a funny taste.

404
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,259
You saw the bride,
which was at him.

405
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,136
Okay, so you want us to buy,

406
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:17,015
that a movie actor as he
descends into crack whores motels, yes?

407
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,893
Yes, and that you came from LA to at
JayJay to live in the crack-whores-Motel.

408
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,312
Listen to me,
Crack whores motel to say?

409
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,607
We say crack-whores-Motel
as often as we like it, asshole!

410
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:30,111
What you're telling us here
is far-fetched.

411
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,487
I'm sorry for you!

412
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,240
Tells me by times,
I've told you shit!

413
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,952
Now listen to me sometimes.
I've reported here. Okay?

414
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:42,457
Why do not you go and talk draws
with the bartender in "Atomic Lounge"?

415
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:46,847
I have sat in front of him three hours
and filled me with tequila.

416
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,048
Do you smell that, you Snoop!

417
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,801
If you did what, then locks me
for the murder of my best friend.

418
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,653
Do you just not forced to!

419
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,445
Otherwise, I reckon,
we're through here.

420
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,719
Grab the types.

421
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,403
I'm sorry, man.
I'm really sorry about earlier.

422
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:42,617
I have no explanation for this ...

423
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,330
But what I, 67 mice.

424
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,542
The we can both drown.

425
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,403
Tequila.

426
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:20,985
The precious stuff.

427
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,994
Yes, thank you.

428
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,311
<i> How's it going? </ i>

429
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,731
Reagan, get out of here.

430
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,819
Come with me!

431
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,123
Hey! Out of the car!

432
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,118
Come on!

433
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,292
Get out already!

434
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,173
Shit! - Thank you.

435
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,303
Crap!

436
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,384
Monika, come on, come on!

437
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,925
Climbing ever! Come on!

438
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,237
He killed them.

439
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,453
Andrea, Double.

440
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,573
Both are dead

441
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,501
I'm sorry, Reagan.

442
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,166
I'm so sorry.

443
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,540
Yeah, me too.

444
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,669
Why do I have no idea what happens?

445
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,215
I have to hide.
You're not sure.

446
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,667
You are just as wrong.

447
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,851
To me you do not worry about.
I'm already dead

448
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,841
You told me, she's dead

449
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,303
Have they folded, you said.
- Yes, I have said.

450
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,014
It is also totally absurd.
I've seen them.

451
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:31,143
I have seen it, Eli.
Seen with my own eyes. She's it.

452
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,371
What are you talking about for a plate?

453
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:39,068
You can believe me.
I'll tell you no shit.

454
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:43,698
I just want to tell, I've seen them,
seen her in the fucking eyes, Eli.

455
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,575
You get a soft pear, sunshine.

456
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,370
You should be more
deal with selling drugs

457
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,163
and do not take this stuff so often.

458
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:55,302
I pay your shitty Villa
and your wacky clothes.

459
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,379
And you bring us the cops into the house.

460
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,006
Moron.

461
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,063
Do you find me my money.

462
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:07,944
And if you can not rely on, trust
I's someone different. Have you got that?

463
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,446
Hisses from.

464
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,538
Have you got it?

465
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,158
But yeah.

466
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,748
All right. Then hissing from.

467
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,959
Yes, I ...

468
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,669
Hisses from!

469
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,387
Wanker!

470
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,670
Not like this.
However,'s okay.

471
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,060
Skin already out.
It's okay. All chic.

472
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,649
Have a nice day, guys.

473
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,036
Terry Jo?

474
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,137
Jamie, Jimbo ...

475
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,062
La Playa Casa.

476
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,675
We have called the La Playa Casa,

477
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:11,554
because I with my sister
actually always wanted to live on the beach.

478
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:15,033
That was a kind of
Insider-joke between us.

479
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,019
In the desert you can
do not live at the beach.

480
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,871
That was really funny.

481
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:25,161
You ought to visit with my parents.
Would you come with me?

482
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,500
Get to know you?

483
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:31,959
I'd find really nice.
I think she would like you.

484
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,928
You silly, du

485
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,893
La Playa Casa.

486
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,437
They think I'm dead

487
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,028
They believe
their two children are dead

488
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,904
Are we indeed.
How should I explain it to you anyway?

489
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,615
Not at all.

490
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,246
Parents will never doubt that
her child in front of them when they see it.

491
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,207
I geh Wait here.

492
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,481
Mother.

493
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,794
Oh God, Mom

494
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,827
She looks like you.

495
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,167
I'm sorry, but your daughters
come to her mother.

496
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,172
Here is Monika
at the high school graduation ceremony.

497
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,881
Wow.

498
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,384
She was a good student.

499
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,846
Her little sister,
her little sister. - Thomas.

500
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,934
What a nonsense.
Has her life thrown away.

501
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:50,504
Are not stunningly beautiful.
Real Thing, right?

502
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,436
Thomas, please.

503
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,785
Create them elsewhere,
my boy. Where do nothing happens.

504
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,820
Walk away with her.

505
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,907
Way out of this hole.

506
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,912
I do not want to lose again.

507
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,209
I create them from here.

508
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,090
We promise.

509
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,447
Yes.

510
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,498
She is off.

511
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,417
Give her already.

512
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,135
Eli.

513
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,803
<i> I'm still here. </ i>

514
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,940
Who am I speaking for?
<i> - You know </ i>.

515
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:21,443
No, I have no idea.

516
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,889
If you do not touch someone

517
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,744
anyone
see your money again never.

518
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,105
I do not get.
<i> - You heard </ i>.

519
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,731
<i> Then you will see
Your money is not back. </ I>

520
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,109
If you even think about it,
again to touch people,

521
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,568
close to me,
I swear to you,

522
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,029
Your lousy few bucks
to blow up the chimney,

523
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,961
You small intellectual asshole!

524
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:50,600
You cursed, stupid whore!

525
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,448
<i> Reagan come, sometimes with. </ i>

526
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,624
<i> Monika </ i>

527
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,881
<i> I need a drink. </ i>

528
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,668
What's the matter,
have you seen about a ghost?

529
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,167
Yes.

530
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:07,844
I have nothing. I'm okay. Thank you.
I do not know, I ...

531
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,995
Also a beer?

532
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,347
You're welcome.

533
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,888
Reagan, come with time.

534
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,723
Where are we going?

535
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,575
There rear.

536
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:54,057
That is,
what each kill everyone.

537
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,724
That for which Leanne
and our friends had to die.

538
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,765
You yourself also.

539
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,760
When I have finished,
what should I do

540
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,648
then you bring the bag
and they are giving my parents.

541
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:15,028
I want them to get the money.
And tell them it comes from her daughters.

542
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,456
Okay?

543
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,649
Yeah, okay.

544
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,706
Yes. I will. Sure.

545
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,385
How did you find out you the job?

546
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,835
Such trees like this one
are anywhere in the area,

547
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,796
and you march directly
to the sand hole.

548
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:47,527
Is a breeze for me.
That was my playground when I was little.

549
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,387
I know every stone here.

550
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,568
Wow.

551
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,318
Since I got the first kiss.

552
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,456
And since my dad has
shooting taught.

553
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,950
I shoot well.

554
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,069
Oh yes. You can with weapons
very good deal.

555
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,697
I know of no woman,
so well to handle it.

556
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:11,033
I wanted to the police.

557
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,243
Oh well. The cops?

558
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,847
Yes. I always wanted to
fight against the bad guys.

559
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:21,835
Daddy was twenty years cop
and before seven years paratroopers.

560
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,562
I have of him.

561
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,814
What has stopped you?

562
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,737
Leanne
has come off the rails.

563
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,807
She began early to drink
and to party.

564
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,319
And in college
it started with the dope.

565
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,438
And guess
who has supplied thereby.

566
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,231
Terry Jo.

567
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:47,370
This stupid pig she learns
know in Atomic, he gives her Meth

568
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,672
She comes on it fully.

569
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,699
I knew how it is to them
and she had it taken away,

570
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,952
before our parents mitkriegen what

571
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,430
or before it goes.

572
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,592
So I met with her, picked her up.

573
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,544
We talked and the police stopped us.

574
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:08,173
She had enough meth here,
to hike for five years in jail.

575
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,969
I took it on myself and put it in
my bag before we were searched.

576
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,821
Why did you do that?

577
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,656
I thought of our father.
If I'd say it's mine ...

578
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,370
You have sacrificed yourself.

579
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:29,277
So did you but your dream job,
So everything that you wanted to make,

580
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,038
a messed up once and for all.

581
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,241
It would have been better
if I were purely hiked instead Leanne.

582
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:37,845
She was my little sister.
I would have died for them.

583
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,433
It went so well.
You have concealed it.

584
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,086
Thanks to my father.
From public reasons.

585
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:49,172
But I could not
come into the police service.

586
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,467
Leanne has still not stopped.
She was in too deep.

587
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:57,014
Then she told me how Terry Jo started
abzuzwacken a few dollars of each deal,

588
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:01,244
to his addiction and his
costly lifestyle fund.

589
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,980
And every time
he took it a little more.

590
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,733
But one day
he had kept too much.

591
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,277
And Eli got it out.
- I swear to you, I have nothing.

592
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:13,256
You dirty, small, cheaters!
- No! I have nothing!

593
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:19,471
Then told Eli Terry Jo,
it was Leanne and not him.

594
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,725
And Eli said Terry Jo,
he should take care of it.

595
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,853
Finally, he missed her
personally an overdose.

596
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,143
At the she dies.

597
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,066
I am sorry.

598
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,370
What's for lunch?
- Be not always so curious.

599
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,970
Get out!
Come out here!

600
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:13,308
No. - Come on!
- No, please do not. - Shut up!

601
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,028
Hi, Thomas.

602
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,565
How's your daughters?

603
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:27,062
Looks as if a
the two would have surprised you.

604
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,243
Or?

605
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,833
Right?

606
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,914
Yes!

607
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,469
You have looked at photos.

608
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,310
Only you and your wife, huh?

609
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,236
Yes.

610
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:04,488
Such very pretty little girl.

611
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:09,413
Yes, really!
What very pretty little girl.

612
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,626
Oh, my God.

613
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:26,718
Comm

614
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,800
Come, come.

615
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,853
Well come on. Come on!

616
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,980
Hurry up!

617
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,406
Oh, my God.

618
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:03,658
Eli! Terry Jo!
You're both dead!

619
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,715
I'll make you flat!

620
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,564
<i> Do not threaten me </ i>

621
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,467
All done.

622
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,594
I have thought so.

623
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,822
It's just not over.

624
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,404
Not for you.

625
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:31,988
Eli, I told you,
I wiederbeschaffe you your money.

626
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,329
Did you say, sunshine.

627
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,707
Have I heard.

628
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:45,919
But lately, my dear,
I'll make me some worried about you.

629
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:55,308
When I came over in 1986,
after that shitty WM for England,

630
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,398
I've got you
taken under my wing.

631
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:06,197
But lately, what's going wrong?

632
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,234
You just make too many mistakes.

633
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,404
Too many goddamn fault.

634
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:19,109
Sometime soon
are no other people there anymore,

635
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,337
which one can be blamed.

636
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,044
You know what I mean.

637
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,524
My Daddy gave me
tells the story of your beautiful country.

638
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,345
Since then, I dream a dream.

639
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,681
The American dream.

640
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:53,820
I'm warning you.
Do it to me indeed is not broke.

641
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:04,836
By tomorrow I will
see the 135 giants.

642
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,659
Is that clear?

643
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,423
Yes.
Is clear. See you tomorrow.

644
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:51,965
<i> Yes. </ i>

645
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:55,134
Here is Terry Jo.
<i> - Ah, yes. Hey, man. </ I>

646
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,470
Listen, I need the money,
that you owe me.

647
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,055
<i> I did not, brother. </ i>

648
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,224
Listen now and write with, man.

649
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,935
I want the coal,
you owe me.

650
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:06,396
<i> Please, man, listen.
I have the money. </ I>

651
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,248
You have to have it!

652
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:13,319
Dude, I know I've said
you have until next week to

653
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,832
but it is sometimes different.
<i> - At the moment I do not got it, man </ i>.

654
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:21,411
You've got fabric
and not paid, you ass!

655
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:25,540
<i> man, I do not have the money.
Next week, as agreed. We promise. </ I>

656
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,768
Next week it's too late!

657
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,311
Shit!

658
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:37,270
It's all right. It's okay.

659
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,401
Hey, What's up, people?

660
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,604
Hey, have a nice day.

661
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,913
Hey, ho. All chic.

662
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,651
Hi, ma'am. How's it going?

663
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,404
Everything okay here?
I so want a cupcake.

664
01:08:56,424 --> 01:09:00,168
I so want a cupcake.
And a side of fries, okay?

665
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,535
I assume the same still
a milkshake to do so.

666
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,704
And you bring me with a coffee.

667
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:08,559
Yes, I want a cupcake
and a coffee.

668
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,732
Get me Terry Jo.

669
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,396
Okay, boss.

670
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,944
What will become of us?

671
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,990
I have got used to you.

672
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,454
I will always be there.

673
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,129
Da.

674
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,048
Eternally.

675
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,921
Since you've found me after all.

676
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,540
What a crock.

677
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,251
What a crock,
all this shit.

678
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,304
God bless America.

679
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,295
Eli, I ...

680
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,748
've ..., Let's say,
not so famous message.

681
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,250
But, please, listen to me.

682
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:18,389
Hey!
Do not make thee a kiss-ass.

683
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,187
I can not suck-off, man.

684
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,144
Eli. Come on.

685
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,856
Please, do not let ... I have ... - Hey!

686
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,617
Stop trying to take on an
to make damn idiots.

687
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,818
If I do not come back,
see you after.

688
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,125
Diving someone of those on, lie to him.

689
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,949
With bulls in the area
not so fast to count.

690
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,006
Are you sure you want to do it?

691
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,931
For the first time in life. Yes.

692
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,272
Where is my money?

693
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,761
The woman has them.

694
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:09,931
The woman, boy is dead

695
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,767
I know.
I know it sounds crazy.

696
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,728
It is beyond me how this works,
but it is still there.

697
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,991
Believe me, it's still there.
- The woman is dead

698
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,985
You are right. You are right.
