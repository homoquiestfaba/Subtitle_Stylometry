00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,470
I'm sure you'll
let me know, Jim.

178
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,238
See you on Friday.

179
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,873
My best to Miriam.

180
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,013
Oh, how beautiful!

181
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,348
The last of my peonies.

182
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,385
[Delia] Oh, aren't you sweet.

183
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,088
Come in, come in, dear friend.

184
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,989
Oh, thank you.

185
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,232
Well...

186
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,000
the Reverend Sykes again?

187
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,902
Hm, how can you tell?

188
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,840
-You're puffing like a pugilist.
-Ah, this town!

189
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,443
Nothing but teeny little minds
and great big lawnmowers.

190
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,279
Oh, it's not that bad.

191
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,450
They made you choir director,
and that reflects taste.

192
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,086
You and I both know
it was your suggestion,

193
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,123
after you slipped on the ice
in front of the church,

194
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,591
that got me the job.

195
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,526
That was a clever moment.

196
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,328
[both chuckle]

197
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,097
"Take an opening,"
Harry always used to say.

198
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,932
Any opening.

199
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,435
Still, they're very lucky
to have you.

200
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,838
Oh, I see that your, uh...

201
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,874
your old college friend
Phoebe Hanson

202
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,576
is in the newspapers
again today.

203
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,112
Singing in Vienna now.

204
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,314
Yep...

205
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,517
She's living a wonderful life.

206
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,624
Oh, to be sure.

207
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,961
Oh, but a new city
every month.

208
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,264
No family, no roots.

209
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,535
What kind of life must that be?

210
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:27,473
Just trying to remind you that
all that glitters isn't gold.

211
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,912
You traded up, Ingrid.

212
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,414
And you should never regret
that choice.

213
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,549
[Ingrid] I don't.

214
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,986
I just wonder sometimes
what it would be like to be...

215
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,490
part of something really
important.

216
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,095
To feel like you really fit in.

217
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,631
Mmm...
in just the right place,

218
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,434
with people who
really appreciated you.

219
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,277
I never noticed that before.

220
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,349
It's Sandy Bottom.

221
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,984
Mm-hmm.

222
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,120
From the old Taylor place
on the hill.

223
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,957
I brought it down
from the guest bedroom today.

224
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,461
Harry painted it years ago,
when he was in one of his moods.

225
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,264
He made the town
look beautiful.

226
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,367
And you know what
a curmudgeon he was.

227
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,604
He's the only person I know
who railed harder than you

228
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:35,241
against small town thinking.

229
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,245
But in his heart,
he really loved this place.

230
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,281
It was in every brush stroke.

231
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,585
There's nothing wrong
in wondering

232
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,556
what your life might have been,
Ingrid.

233
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,693
But don't overlook
what you hold in your hands.

234
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,068
-What's that?
-Gazpacho.

235
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,037
It's very healthy.
You'll love it.

236
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,507
And hurry up because we've gotta
be at the meeting in an hour.

237
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,014
So, what's happening
at the world's greatest dairy?

238
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,050
Well, I have some news.

239
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:23,289
I've made a decision about
this year's Dairy Days concert.

240
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,491
You know, in the past,
we've done, uh...

241
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,526
oh, marching bands,
and oom-pah bands

242
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,328
until we're blue in the face.

243
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,130
So I got to thinking

244
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,599
that Sandy Bottom is ready
for something...

245
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,268
grander.

246
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,037
Such as?

247
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,005
Such as...

248
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,209
a real classical concert,

249
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,012
using the best musicians
from all over the county.

250
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,448
Classical,
like Mozart classical?

251
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,650
-Exactly.
-[Ingrid] Um...

252
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,552
could you get the ice pack,
Rachel?

253
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,587
'Cause I think your father
must be burning up.

254
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,589
I'm serious. Now why shouldn't
this town experience

255
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,459
something sophisticated
for once? Right?

256
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,261
A little high art couldn't hurt.

257
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,430
Classical music
in Sandy Bottom?

258
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,699
Norman, it's an oxymoron!

259
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,168
They would laugh you right out
of the bandshell.

260
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,137
Well, I'm surprised to hear
that coming from you, Ingrid,

261
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,672
the last defender of the muse.

262
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,275
Well, I personally
would love it, but you know,

263
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,177
I would be just about
the only one.

264
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,513
Well...
I think it's a great idea.

265
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,681
Maybe.

266
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,483
All right,
so I've got two takers.

267
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,684
Now, come Labor Day,

268
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,654
the whole town will be glad
I thought of it.

269
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,559
Hey, you just wait and see.

270
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,695
[mayor] The simple fact is that
the Ramsey Building

271
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,064
has to come down...

272
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,533
to make way for these valuable

273
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,602
and needed services
for the community.

274
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,371
Yeah, like pizza.

275
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,240
Now, I know I'm not alone...

276
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,577
when I say that this idea
of turning the Ramsey into

277
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:57,383
some kind of art complex is just
a hairbrained scheme...

278
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,519
to get the taxpayers
to fund a private playground

279
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,255
for the three or four people
in town

280
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,558
who like to listen to this
screechy-scratchy music

281
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,728
and look at pieces of junk that
somebody stuck up on the wall

282
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,296
and called art.

283
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,665
[man] Hear, hear!

284
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,169
I just wish the whiners
and the naysayers

285
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,839
and the oh so "chick"
radical element

286
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,209
who expect government to build
their fantasy world

287
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:28,547
would just all go away and let
decent, hardworking people

288
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,550
enjoy the wonderful town
that Sandy Bottom is.

289
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,419
[loud cheers]

290
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,720
All right, all right.

291
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,156
We haven't lost our civility,
have we?

292
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,358
Let's have order here.

293
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,593
Ingrid, uh... Mrs. Green.

294
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,195
Thank you, Fred.

295
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,365
Um, I know the mayor and,
and plenty of others here

296
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,300
would probably like to see
nothing better

297
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,436
than my backside going
to Minneapolis.

298
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,570
[crowd chuckles]

299
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,771
But I'll be darned

300
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,807
if I'm going to let
this very narrow view

301
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,843
of public good stand
without a fight.

302
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,779
Now I think that this town needs

303
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,816
to preserve what little it
possesses in the way of history.

304
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,552
And the Ramsey Building is
a link between who we've been

305
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,820
and where we're going.

306
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,788
[scattered applause]

307
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,791
And you speak for this town,
Mrs. Green?

308
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,693
[Ingrid] Well, maybe, maybe not.

309
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,361
Now I'm not saying
that the Ramsey Building

310
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,930
has to be an art center.

311
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,300
There are probably plenty
of other uses, things
we haven't thought of yet.

312
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,836
I'm just saying, let's not swing
the wrecking ball

313
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,171
before we've thought about it,

314
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,808
because our children might
regret it in the morning.

315
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,677
Oh, here we go again.

316
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,378
Well, if it's a fight you want,

317
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,314
it's a fight you'll get,
Mrs. Green.

318
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,549
Well, Mayor, there's nothing
I'd like better.

319
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,418
So may the best man win.

320
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,354
[laughter and applause]

321
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,997
[Rachel]
So it had begun,

322
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,701
my mother's quest to save a
piece of Sandy Bottom history.

323
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,503
[Ingrid]
...the first Swedish settlers.

324
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,837
Look at this hand-carved...

325
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,874
[Rachel]
She organized the
troops at the Ramsey Building

326
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,842
and launched a campaign
to win over

327
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,345
all the doubting Thomases
in our town.

328
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,947
These are hand-hewn
white pine boards...

329
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,484
[Rachel]
My father was becoming
the impresario

330
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,953
of northern Wisconsin,
booking a conductor

331
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,289
and producing
what he had hoped would be

332
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,657
the high-water mark

333
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,226
of Sandy Bottom's
dubious musical history.

334
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,231
I was just hoping to survive
both of their schemes

335
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,567
with a shred
of personal dignity.

336
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,938
So tell me honestly,
on a scale of like 1 to 10...

337
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:36,241
how weird is my mom? Like a 9?

338
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,710
No, maybe a 6.

339
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,445
A 6 or a 7.

340
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,647
[sighs]

341
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,315
But I still like her.

342
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,985
-You do?
-She's cool.

343
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,454
My dad thinks she's the smartest
person in town.

344
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,725
Hey, Carol, Ginny's having
a slumber party

345
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,860
for the team tomorrow.

346
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,994
Can you come?

347
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,897
-Um, what about Rachel?
-Well...

348
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,935
it's Ginny's party, and she's
just invited the team.

349
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,737
I don't want to come
without her.

350
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,840
Hey, if it's for team members,
it's for team members.

351
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,911
-You sure?
-Sure I'm sure.

352
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,317
-Okay, then count me in.
-Great, later on.

353
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,554
Thanks for taking a stand.

354
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,789
What do you mean?

355
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,525
You said you didn't care.

356
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,826
Look, I don't, okay?

357
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,596
You have your new friends
and you don't have time

358
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,965
for your old one.

359
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,733
Well, that's not fair.

360
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,401
Look, you're busy
with baseball.

361
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,470
And you've got violin.

362
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,905
So we like different things.

363
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:40,906
So what?

364
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:41,907
And different people.

365
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,277
Okay, we're different.
Have we settled that?

366
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,616
I've got to get to class.

367
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,387
[Rachel]
"Different"
in Sandy Bottom

368
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,290
could make you
a very lonely person.

369
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,719
Terrific... terrific!

370
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,988
Um... no, I'll work out
the details

371
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,857
with your representatives.

372
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,092
Yeah.
I look forward to meeting you.

373
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,460
Yeah...

374
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,565
Yeah.
See you in a few weeks. Bye.

375
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,967
Wow.

376
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,803
How is my gorgeous daughter?

377
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,739
Why so glum, huh?

378
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,641
It's nothing.

379
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,778
You're pretty chipper.

380
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,613
Well, you are looking at the man

381
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,648
who just signed the talented
and brash...

382
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,517
young Adam Cornish...

383
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,620
to conduct the Dairy Days
Orchestra.

384
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,855
Adam Cornish from Boston?

385
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,724
The very same.

386
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,093
Wow! I'm impressed.

387
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,829
Even your mother might be
won over by this news, huh?

388
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:11,897
Hmm.

389
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,733
-Guess what.
-What?

390
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:19,805
I want you...
in the violin section.

391
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,073
Me?

392
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:25,077
Yeah. I know you can do it, and
you're going to get paid, honey.

393
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,511
I mean, it's not much.

394
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,880
Yeah. It's like the life
of a real musician.

395
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,994
You know, I, uh...
I, uh...

396
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,497
I think I've done enough work
for one day.

397
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,532
All right?

398
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:51,203
You want to... you want to take
a walk with me in the meadow?

399
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,171
Yeah.

400
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,073
Okay.

401
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,842
Good.

402
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,450
Take a deep breath.

403
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,553
This is what green smells like.

404
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,991
Is everything all right
with you?

405
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:16,962
You don't seem quite yourself
these days.

406
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,232
I don't know what myself is
supposed to be.

407
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,167
I know that...

408
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,803
I don't fit in very well.

409
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:30,041
You know what kids used
to call me when I was 14?

410
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,145
Lefty.

411
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,714
But you're right-handed.

412
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,483
Mmm, well, I'm afraid
you inherited the, uh...

413
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,886
"no good at sports" gene.

414
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,587
[sighs]

415
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:47,092
Boy, kids can be so cruel
sometimes, you know?

416
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,528
How did you stand it?

417
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,897
[sighs]

418
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,032
Well, I spent a lot of time
alone,

419
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,101
tramping in the fields,
the woods.

420
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,273
And then I started noticing
things.

421
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,176
Subtle,
really beautiful things,

422
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,045
that I'm sure the kids in town
were missing.

423
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:12,751
Like, um... like how
a milkweed grows, and, uh...

424
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,287
the special care a...
a duck takes

425
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,223
in building its nest.

426
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,091
And that got me interested
in science,

427
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,294
and after a while, uh...

428
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,529
I stopped feeling lonely.

429
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,736
And I started to feel like
I was a part of...

430
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,043
the wonders that were happening
all around me.

431
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,549
Does that make any sense?

432
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,787
I love you, Dad.

433
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,896
You know, there is no
one right way to grow up.

434
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:02,634
You're doing it
Rachel Green's way.

435
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,970
And it's lovely to watch.

436
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,998
[Rachel]
With school out

437
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,001
and Carol disappearing into
the world of girl's baseball,

438
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,770
I tried making other friends.

439
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,640
But a good dose of Norman
and Ingrid's eccentric side

440
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:42,908
was generally enough

441
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,177
to guarantee
my solitary existence.

442
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,647
[Ingrid] And if the Mayor
and his cohorts

443
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,015
think they'll prevail,

444
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,384
they've got another thing
coming...

445
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,785
Who's that?

446
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,754
Because those of us
with a conscience

447
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,956
cannot help but be outraged...

448
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,359
-My mother.
-Who's she talking to?

449
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,661
No one.

450
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,062
Um... she's formulating.

451
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,665
She... writes letters.

452
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,968
Hey, is that you, Rachel?

453
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,670
Listen, tell me
what you think of this.

454
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,872
-M-Mom, not now, okay?
-Mr. Mayor...

455
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,641
Hi.
Who's your new friend?

456
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,842
This is Melanie.

457
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,045
We're going to go in the back.

458
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,781
[Ingrid] Okay, sweetie.
Nice to meet you.

459
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:27,052
And since when did videos
replace reading...

460
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,654
Since when...

461
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,890
when did videos replace reading?

Have you ever heard anything
so magnificent, huh?

There was always
Saturday,

470
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,194
the day reserved
for my violin lesson

471
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,230
at Mr. Amidore's music school
in Oshkosh.

472
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,767
It was a long drive,

473
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,137
but I never minded,
because in those days,

474
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,473
Mr. Amidore's was
the only place

475
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,476
where I felt sort of normal.

Here's my Rachella
and Mrs. Green.

479
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,951
Delightful to see you.

480
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,786
[Ingrid] Hello, Mr. Amidore.

481
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,488
I've made brownies,
Rachella.

482
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,889

-Yes!

-Oh!
-These, these look great.

485
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,031
Oh, you have. Come, come.
That's it.

486
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,799
Oh, musicians...

487
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,368
they're all skin and bone.

00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,971
All right, time to tune up.

Here are the brochures

00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,377
I will not say a word to Rachel.

491
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,814
I'll leave that up to you.
But I urge you to consider it.

492
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,418
Now I warn you:
the requirements are strict,

493
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,088
and the auditions
can be grueling.

494
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:13,091

00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,393

What are you doing?

499
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,054
You're not concentrating.

500
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:47,959
The violin makes music because
it sits just above the heart.

501
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:51,262
But how can you connect the two

502
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:55,133
unless you feel the music?

503
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,305
Again.

504
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,125
Thank you.

00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,194
No more than usual.

much to yell at.

I hear your dad's putting
together an orchestra

That's fantastic!

I know, he's so talented.

522

No...

00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,534
It's Michigan, Norman.

531
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,571
And she would have to live there
during the school year.

532
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,639
No way!

533
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,241
I don't want her leaving home.

534
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,477
What's wrong with Mr. Amidore?

535
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,212
Well, he can only take her
so far.

536
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,280
He said so himself.

537
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,016
I mean, he is the one
who suggested Interlochen.

538
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,052
Well, she's a baby, she belongs
here in Sandy Bottom.

539
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:05,456
She's 14, Norman, and she's
already showing signs of having

540
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,292
the talent "blanded" out of her.

541
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,060
-Blanded?
-Yeah!

542
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,995
You see how she is.

543
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,297
She tries to please everyone,

544
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,666
she's trying to please
the wrong people.

545
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,069
At Interlochen,
she would be exposed

546
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:22,006
to a whole world of music,
and art, and...

547
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,275
things you just...
you can't get here.

548
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,379
That world exists in... in
New York, or Chicago at least.

549
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,681
Not Sandy Bottom.

550
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,383
Yeah, this place
has a sense of community.

551
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,620
You can't get that
in a big city.

552
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:40,258
All you get is... arrogance.

553
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,795
A herd of cows has a sense
of community, Norman.

554
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:47,098
Last time I looked, those cows
did pretty well by this family.

555
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,573
Do you want her to...
look back and... and wonder

556
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,175
what she might have become

557
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,244
because we didn't at least
offer her a chance?

558
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,452
Like I took your chance away.

559
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,289
I chose.

560
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,360
And I chose pretty damn well.

561
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,066
Well...

562
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,735
maybe we could write them.

563
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,336
[gasps]

564
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,207
[chuckles]

565
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,541
Oh...

566
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,715
[sighs]

567
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,788
[Rachel]
By the next morning,
the letter was posted.

568
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,225
By noon, Mother had another
crisis on her hands.

569
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,128
[choir singing fugue]

570
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,183
Is something wrong,
Mrs. Granlund?

571
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,719
Mrs. Green, pardon me
for being forward,

572
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,156
but I don't think this music
belongs in the Lutheran Church.

573
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:21,459
It may be nice in Carnegie Hall
with professionals,

574
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,561
but it doesn't do anything
for me.

575
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:27,365
Either you're in
the wrong place, or I am.

576
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:32,336
Well, Mrs. Granlund,
I have no intention of leaving.

577
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,638
Very well.

578
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,410
Coming, Cora?

579
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,180
Please, don't do this.

580
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,817
You'll be hearing
from Reverend Sykes.

581
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,255
[Rachel]
There must have been
something in the air that day,

582
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,525
because the hurt simmering
between Carol and me

583
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,861
boiled into a row, too.

584
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,730
I said awful things,
she said awful things.

585
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,332
It was clear to me

586
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,302
that I just didn't fit into
her world anymore.

587
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:07,672
I'd be alone forever now.

588
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,147
[sniffling]

589
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,438
[violin playing "Ave Maria"]

590
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,348
[Norman] Anyone home?

591
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,250
Up here, Norman.

592
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,490
[sighs]

593
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,658
Norman?

594
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,260
What... what's wrong?

595
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,262
Adam Cornish jumped ship on us.

596
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,330
[gasps]

597
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,032
He's history,
got a better offer.

598
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,301
The booking agent tried
to get a replacement,

599
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,904
but no one's available,
so he suggested...

600
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,573
that we bag the concert.

601
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,576
Oh, no! Norman!

602
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,944
Oh, I'm so sorry.

603
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,278
[Rachel] Me too, Daddy.

604
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,580
So I got to thinking,

605
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,049
that punk is not going
to ruin our Dairy Days.

606
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,250
You know?

607
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,652
If that turkey thinks he's
the only conductor in Wisconsin,

608
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,322
well, then I say... ha!

609
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,692
He thinks he's such a genius
that he can cancel on a whim.

610
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:12,296
I say, "Well, go ahead,
Mr. Big Shot, 'cause...

611
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,498
I'll conduct them myself."

612
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,572
Norman, you've never conducted
an orchestra.

613
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,976
Yeah, well...
not yet, maybe.

614
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,711
I mean, there was a time

615
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,846
when Leonard Bernstein
hadn't conducted an orchestra,

616
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,381
so what did he do?

617
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,551
He got up...
and he conducted one.

618
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,453
You see what I'm saying? See?

619
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,355
W-what's the big mystery
about it?

620
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,691
Daddy,
you're not Leonard Bernstein.

621
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,795
And he wasn't Norman Green.

622
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,997
I know music.

623
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,366
I love it, I can read music.

624
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,004
What is a conductor?

625
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,006
He's not a musician,
a musician plays.

626
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,643
A conductor pulls everyone
together and, and...

627
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,478
guides everyone
in the same direction.

628
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,046
See? I can do that.

629
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,582
Oh, Lord!

630
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,686
Well... it's a done deal.

631
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,989
All we've got to do is go around
town and change all the posters.

632
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,190
Let me see those!

633
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:18,362
Ha-ha. Sandy Bottom hasn't
heard the last from this family.

Hello?

638
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,869
[Delia] Oh, in the living room,
dear.

639
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,676
Oh, Dr. Winters,
is everything all right?

640
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,011
[Delia] Rachel too!

641
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,480
Come on, give me a kiss.

642
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,716
Oh, no, everything's just fine.

643
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,417
Not to worry.

644
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,021
For now, but her angina's back,
and it's getting worse.

645
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,523
You've got to get more rest,
Delia.

646
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,158
Stop exerting yourself.

647
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,927
Nonsense!

648
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,996
I may not have many more gardens
left in me,

649
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,999
and I still have
to plant my bulbs.

650
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,868
Well, Rachel and I can do that
for you.

651

Ah, she's impossible.

At my age, I am not buying

young trees,

with a woman like this?

657
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:49,053
Just stay out of her way!

658
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,055
I'll be back Friday.

659
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,023
I'll have the pharmacy drop
your prescription by.

660

over at Bethesda.

Well, I'm waiting for the shoe
to drop.

668
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,811
Is it so awful to try
to get people

669
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,179
to broaden their horizons?

670
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,681
Of course not, honey.

671
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,017

in Minneapolis.

in jail.

Are you and Daddy happy?

I mean, are you glad you married
each other?

00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,310
Of course we are.

681
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:23,747
Well... is there some kind
of problem with me?

682
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,653
I found the letter
from Interlochen.

683
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,322
It was opened.

684
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:35,025
Sweetie, Interlochen is
a school for kids in the arts.

685
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,595
It's got nothing to do with you
being a problem

686
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,964
and nothing
to do with Daddy and me.

687
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,832
We were going to tell you...

688
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,635
as soon as we knew
that we could afford it.

689
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,570
And then we would consider it
together

690
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,672
and we would make a choice.

691
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:54,745
I think they could bring out
your talent there
and help you to develop it.

692
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,916
Maybe I don't have that much
to develop.

693
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:03,087

Spoken like a true artist.

694
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:11,095
-Interlochen.
-Mm-hmm.

Higher, higher!

Attack stronger!

697
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,304
That's enough for now.

698

I'm really trying, Mr. Amidore.

699
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,643
I know.

00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,680

for the concert, um...

00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:49,460
Ives' "Variations on America,"
and...

707
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:53,797
Mozart's A-major
piano concerto.

708
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,100
Wow!

709
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,069
Uh... that's brave, Norman.

710
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,171
Brave to the point of insanity.

711
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:05,776
This is... this is really
challenging material.

712
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,846
Who exactly are you going to get
to play the piano in the Mozart?

713
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,151
Me? No.
No, no, no, no, no, no...

714
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,353
No. No!

715
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,023
Of course you! You're the best
pianist in a country mile.

716
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,024
And if I'm not mistaken,

717
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,192
this was your graduation
recital piece, right?

718
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,395
Now you should sail
through this.

719
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,430
Come on, Mom.
I think it's a great idea!

720
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,465
No, you are...
you are crazy, both of you!

721
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,834
Honestly, I-I haven't played
for an audience, you know,

722
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:31,935
in 15 years.

723
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,003
No, really, no.

724
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,272
Half this town, you know,
wants my head already

725
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,974
and they would just be holding
their breath

726
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,409
for my first mistake.

727
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,177
-But, Ingrid, I'm telling you...
-No, really.

728
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,046
Seriously, they would howl me
off the stage

729
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,847
before you ever
even raised your baton.

730
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,149
Hey, hey. Let them howl.

731
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,118
We'll face them together.

732
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,421
[sighs, stammers]
This... is...

733
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,289
No, no.
Really, really, I'm flattered.

734
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,491
Really I am, but,
but, uh...

735
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,461
I won't be the one
to lead you to the slaughter.

736
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,030
So you have to find
somebody else to do that.

737
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,999
So... I don't want
to hear about it

738
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,500
from either one of you. Okay?

739
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,035
That's that.

740
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,406
[exhales]

741
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,809
Your mother...

742
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,880
Frankly, Ingrid...
your choice of music

743
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,950
and your treatment of the choir
members is causing, um...

744
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,518
deep discomfort.

745
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,988
But even so, we pulled off
the Bach last month.

746
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,391
You remember? You yourself said
that you found it moving.

747
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,093
Well, yes.

748
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,994
But the church is here
to welcome people,

749
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,529
not to make them feel inferior.

750
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,432
Well, the church can be
as welcoming as it likes,

751
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,368
but, you know, some people just
can't sing worth beans.

752
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:42,840
The ill feeling has gone
well beyond the choir loft.

753
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,175
And how do you expect people
to keep their minds

754
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:49,379
on spiritual matters
during those explosive,

755
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,982
almost heathen organ preludes
you play?

756
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,117
Heathen?

757
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,551
Eugene, that's ridiculous.

758
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,487
Let me put it more simply:

759
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,188
Mrs. Granlund is not a person

760
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,824
who I want to see going over
to the Methodists.

761
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,894
Well, I suggest that Mrs. Green
submit all of her music

762
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,964
to the Worship Committee
for approval beforehand.

763
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,832
Seems reasonable to me, Ingrid.

764
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,601
Oh, that'd be fine with me.

765
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,203
As long as I get to edit
your sermons.

766
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,382
All right, Mrs. Green, we have
a proposition for you.

767
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,618
Now, you've complained for years
about this little house.

768
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,520
There's no room to spread out,
uh...

769
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:33,157
no room for grandchildren...
if and when we have them.

770
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,324
[sigh]

771
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,093
All that can change because,
honey,

772
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,296
the old Taylor house is
up for sale.

773
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,632
This could be the home
of your dreams right here,

774
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,400
in Sandy Bottom.

775
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,238
Honey, what's wrong? Ingrid?

776
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,007
If it weren't for you
and Rachel,

777
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,642
I'd leave here this minute!

778
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,945
For 14 years, I've tried to fit
in here, tried to...

779
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,915
matter to people
in this mud puddle!

780
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,517
But it's no use!
[sobbing]

781
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,119
What happened?

782
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,988
They fired me!

783
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,990
Oh...

784
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:13,130
[sobbing]

785
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,966
It's finally out in the open,
they...

786
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,901
they just don't feel
that I belong,

787
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,437
and I can't disagree anymore!

788
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,188
[Rachel]
My father was extra
sweet to her that night.

789
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,391
And though the storm over
Mother's firing at Bethesda

790
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,527
continued to rumble
in our household,

791
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,263
she wasn't down for long.

792
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,532
Without the choir
to distract her,

793
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:52,536
she was on an all-out mission
to save the Ramsey Building.

794
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,138
In her heart,
she thought if she failed,

795
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:59,243
she'd have to leave
Sandy Bottom once and for all.

796
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:03,447
[indistinct chatter,
orchestra tuning up]

797
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,329
Hey, Rachel.

798
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,665
Hi, Scott!

799
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:26,470
-So this is it, huh?
-Yeah, I guess so.

800
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,705
Well, good luck to all of us,
right?

801
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,275
Yeah.

802
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:35,212
I've got to go tune up.
See you, okay?

803
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,114
[Klonowski]
Violins, spread out!

804
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,350
You look like overstuffed
sardines!

805
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,319
You are?

806
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,388
Rachel Green.

807
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,658
Oh, the conductor's daughter.

808
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,661
Well, we shall see, um...

809
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,134
Don't mind Klonowski.

810
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,269
His bark is worse than his bite.

811
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,338
I'm Evelyn Carlson.

812
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,274
Welcome to the Funny Farm.

813
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,343
I don't know your father's work,
um...

814
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,111
Where has he conducted?

815
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:11,014
Oh... you know, here and there.

816
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,251
Mostly, um... local things.

817
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:27,331
Good afternoon!
I'm Norman Green.

818
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:33,036
And, uh...
let's start with the Ives.

819
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,705
We, uh...

820
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,641
We need an "A".

821
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,609
Of course.

822
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,478
Please.

823
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,625
[Klonowski] A question
for oboes, Maestro.

824
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,296
In measure 51, uh,
what are our notes?

825
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,698
There may be a mistake
in the part.

826
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,769
Uh...

827
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,804
No, they seem right to me.

828
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,806
But, um...

829
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,842
Let's see what happens
when we get there.

830
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,976
[Klonowski] Okay.

831
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,679
All right, let's, uh,
let's take her for a test run,

832
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,748
shall we?

833
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:23,320
From the top.
Little slower tempo at first.

834
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,423
One, two, three, one, two...

835
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,295
Fifteen minutes, people.

836
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,596
Then right back.

837
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,800
Your father is doing fine.

838
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,635
Ah, he's a little bumpy
in spots,

839
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:47,504
but at least he's got
music sense.

840
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,939
Do you really think so?

841
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,842
Oh, believe me, if he didn't,
he'd be dead already.

842
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,211
[chuckles]
We're an unforgiving lot.

843
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:57,747
And I'm going for coffee.

844
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,283
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi, Scott.

845
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,619
Violins sound good.

846
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,621
You especially.

847
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:08,558
-You can't hear me!
-No, I can.

848
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,759
I know your sound.

849
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,295
It's... it's warmer
than the rest.

850
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,703
I was wondering if...

851
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,372
maybe you wanted
to go out sometime?

852
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,511
[Norman] Hey!

853
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,314
[Ingrid] Ah!

854
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,650
Well, no visible wounds!

855
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:36,553
Oh, it was great.
You should've seen Dad.
He was amazing.

856
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,955
Really? And you made it through
the fast part okay?

857
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,958
Ah, some of it was wretched.
But...

858
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,693
we ended at the same time.

859
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:44,961
Well, I'll be darned.

860
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,696
Yeah, I tried to give them
a clear downbeat,

861
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,964
and they took it from there.

862
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,900
Sometimes you have
to let go of the reins

863
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,302
and trust the horses will
take you back to the barn.

864
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,838
-And that worked?
-[sighs] Seemed to.

865
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:58,375
Oh! This calls for a big,
fat pork chop dinner.

866
00:52:58,408 --> 00:52:59,943
-Seriously?
-[chuckles]

867
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,811
How many households
in Sandy Bottom

868
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,380
have a conductor in residence?

869
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,015
Besides, you'll need
fortification

870
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,651
for the Mozart next week.

871
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,554
[Rachel]
I couldn't recall
a happier time.

872
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,322
For one night at least,

873
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,859
the Greens of Sandy Bottom
seemed almost normal.

874
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,862
[playing ragtime]

875
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,635
[Rachel and Norman chuckling]

876
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,010
That's a fine idea.

877
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,712
Really capital.

878
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:38,682
But we've got to get the town
council to postpone demolition

879
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,383
for a few weeks,
because we need time

00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,053
to organize the clothing
and the food bank.

881
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,488
And we could finally
move meetings

882
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,958
out of that cramped townhall.

883
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,961
It's got really magnificent
walls for artwork,

884
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,862
and the high school artists
would have

885
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,464
an absolute field day, I think.

[sighs]

887
00:53:55,699 --> 00:54:00,437
Oh, I admire your dreams
and your zeal.

888
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,707
If I were ten years younger...

889
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,409
I'd be on the front lines
with you.

890
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,815

that simple fact.

Haven't you heard?

911
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,366
His wife's very ill; paralyzed
with depression they say.

912
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,769
He had to check her into

-What?
-Yeah, it's just awful.

914
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,140
I guess she's been suffering
with it for a long time.

915

And now...
Well, Jim's got his hands full.

Before we begin today,

934
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,624
I'd like to take a moment
to thank you all

935
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:45,261
for your concern about Miriam.

936
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,765
I have communicated your cards
and your calls to her...

937
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,202
and I believe they are helping.

938
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,970
I...

939
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:03,680
I'd like to tell you
about one...

940
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:07,250
generous act in particular
that has surprised me.

941
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,788
And I thought, having ministered
for 15 years,

942
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,791
that there were
no more surprises.

943
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,693
But I was wrong.

944
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,967
Last night...

945
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,170
somebody left a week's worth
of meals for me and my boys

946
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,340
on our front porch.

947
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:33,142
There was, uh...

948
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,312
there was no note.

949
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,349
Just the reassurance in that...

950
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:43,286
lovely act of kindness in
the dark that we are not alone.

951
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:52,028
In my...

952
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:55,598
in my deep distress, I had come
to believe that we were.

953
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,802
How wrong I was.

954
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,909
[sighs]

955
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,344
We misjudge each other...

956
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,882
if in the heat of argument
or disagreement,

957
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:15,852
or in the simple routines
of daily life,

958
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:20,957
we fail to see that God
is in each of us, always,

959
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,730
struggling to love
and to be loved in return.

960
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,605
We are, none of us, alone.

961
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,677
We belong to each other.

962
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:53,056
I thank you,
my anonymous friend,

963
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,024
for refreshing my faith.

[Rachel]
The concert loomed.

965
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,138
In just three weeks,

966
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,941
my father would either make
a complete fool of himself

967
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,077
or become a local hero.

968
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,446
He'd hired a wunderkind
16-year-old pianist

969
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,915
from Green Bay
to play the Mozart.

970
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,850
The first rehearsal with him
was scheduled

971
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,952
for the coming weekend.

972
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:25,755
Now, Mrs. Johnson,

973
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,125
the temperature will be
set at 72 degrees.

974
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,426
Oh, no! I understand.
Please.

975
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,128
Don't give it a second thought.

976
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,798
I agree.

977
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:39,068
I think it's crucial
that we protect his hands.

978
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,703
Yeah.

979
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,338
Bye-bye!

980
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,444
Norman, what have you gotten
yourself into?

981
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:52,348
Um, Mrs. Johnson is a bit
protective of young Drew.

982
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,251
Well, she sounds like a kook
if you ask me.

983
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,986
But does he even know
the Mozart?

984
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,955
She says he does,
forwards and backwards.

985
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,990
Well, forward would be
sufficient.

986
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,493
-Yeah.

987
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:08,831

01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,841
Yeah, just one minute.

990
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,110
It's Dr. Winters.

991
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,380
Hello?

992
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,819
How is she?

993
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,487
It was a mild heart attack,

994
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,990
but she's not responding
to the medication.

995
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,427
And she absolutely refuses
to go to the hospital.

996
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,862
She asked for you, Ingrid.

997
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,188
Now, now.

998
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,357
None of that.

999
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,494
Are you in pain?

1000
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,930
Not so bad, really.

1001
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,898
You shouldn't have done
so much.

1002
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,900
You should've rested more.

1003
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,470
I was living, Ingrid.

1004
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:24,040
And enjoying every minute of it.

1005
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,243
Please don't leave me.

1006
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,415
Well, I have to, dear.

Sooner or later.

I was at her house,
right behind you.

1021
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,212
But she was sleeping
when I got there.

1022
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,981
I'll call on her later.

1023
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:42,185
I, uh...
[clearing throat]

1024
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,387
I came to see you.

1025
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,089
And I know it's not
the best of times.

1026
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,325
Well, please, sit down.

1028
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,431
I'll get right to it, Ingrid.

1029
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,500
I want you back
as our choir director.

1030
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,037
We, uh...

1031
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,673
We just didn't know
what we had...

1032
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,175
not until we lost it.

1033
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,445
Aw, heck, Ingrid, you know
what that choir sounds like.

1034

[giggles]

1035
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,450
Please...

1036
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,152
say yes.

1037
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,321
Would the Worship Committee
be approving the music?

1038
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,655
Absolutely not.

1039
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,058
You'd be sole captain
of your ship.

1040
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,526
And how about Mrs. Granlund?

1041
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,461
Well, if...

1042
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,264
if we lose her,
it'll be the Methodists' gain.

1043
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,465
[chuckles]

1044
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:32,602
Well, of course I'll come back.

1045
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,337
Oh, that's good!

1046
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,438
That...

1047
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,107
That's just fine.

1048
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,675
Hallelujah!

1049
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:47,250
Well, I'd better be going.

1050
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,493
How's Miriam?

1051
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,028
It'll take time.

1052
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,997
She's been very ill.

1053
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:03,332
The pressures
on a minister's wife,

1054
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,635
always being pushed
in front of people.

1055
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,670
It hasn't been good for her.

I'm thinking about leaving
the ministry, Ingrid.

It's the first time
I've said it out loud.

01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:26,188
There's a good real estate
course in Milwaukee, and, uh...

1060
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:30,393
We'd be close to the doctors
if Miriam needs them.

1061
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,695
Change might be good
for all of us.

1062
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,466
We would miss you...

1063
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,536
so much.

1064
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,038
[Sykes] Well...

1065
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,444
I think the town is still
in good hands.

1066
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:55,518
I think these belong to you.

1067
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,787
Yep.

1068
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,090
Thank you again.

1069
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,359
And welcome back.

1070
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:16,138
[Rachel]
Mother's curiosity
finally got the best of her.

1071
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,274
She just had to see
the piano wunderkind

1072
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,077
my father had turned up.

1073
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,278
Excuse me.

1074
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,813
Where might I find
the conductor?

1075
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,348
Oh, he's in the corner.

1076
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,415
Oh, you must be Drew.

1077
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:27,516
Yes, it is.

1078
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,218
And I'm his mother,
Mrs. Johnson.

1079
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:30,219
Ah, hello!

1080
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,189
Drew, wait there.
[sighs]

1081
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:36,559
Would you mind?

1082
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:38,327
His name's Michele.

1083
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,296
Oh, no treats!

1084
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:44,633
Now, I don't care if the concert
is in a bandshell, Mr. Green.

1085
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,669
Drew needs
a private dressing room.

1086
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,671
Now I thought I made this clear.

1087
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:52,508
He can't share a common space
because he needs to lie down

1088
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,377
when he's not playing.

1089
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,245
His sugar imbalance?

1090
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,547
Now I told you this
on the phone!

1091
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:00,716
Mrs. Johnson,
I'll see what I can do.

1092
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,685
Maybe we can get an RV
or a camper...

1093
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:04,820
Well, whatever,
but it needs to be quiet,

1094
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:08,557
and it needs to be dark,
and curtains will be mandatory.

1095
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,360
Now, do we understand
each other?

1096
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,662
I believe we do.

1097
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,531
Good.

1098
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,566
Okay, now I'll go check on Drew,

1099
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,102
and good luck with
your rehearsal.

1100
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,578
[sighs]

1101
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

1102
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,616
it is my great pleasure
to introduce our soloist,

1103
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,885
Mr. Drew Johnson from Green Bay.

1104
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,421
[applause]

1105
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,427
Could somebody close that door
back there?

1106
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,430
There's a wind howling
through here!

1107
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:49,799
Thank you!

1108
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:53,669
All right,
shall we try the Mozart?

1109
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:56,906
A chill could ruin
his performance.

1110
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:59,909
You know, I am so sorry about
shoving Michele on you,

1111
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,778
Mrs. Green, but I thought
you were a musician.

1112
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,119
[concerto begins]

1113
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:38,681
Drew?

1114
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,685
Is everything all right?

1115
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,587
That was your cue.

1116
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,956
You know, I don't think
he can see you very well

1117
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,891
from where he is, Mr. Green.

1118
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:58,767
Carry on, Mr. Green.

1119
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,704
[musicians murmuring]

1120
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,208
[music resumes]

1121
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:53,789
[piano out of sync]

1122
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,325
[playing wrong notes]

1123
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,394
[loudspeaker feedback]

1124
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,631
Well, this piano bench
is wobbling!

1125
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,034
You know,
I could see that from here!

1126
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:07,002
Now if we could just take
two minutes

1127
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,471
to see that it doesn't wobble
anymore,

1128
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:13,042
I think we're going to save
ourselves a lot of time here!

1129
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,810
[sighs]

1130
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:15,844
Amateurs!

1131
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,279
[woman]
It's so embarrassing...

1132
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:18,681
In a good way.

1133
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,985
Excuse me!

1134
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:26,455
You know, I was told that this
was a professional engagement!

1135
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,457
Well, it is!
It is, Mrs. Johnson...

1136
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,925
[man] It is a professional
engagement!

1137
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,361
-[Drew] Mom!
-You know this boy is a...

1138
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,597
is a talented,
sensitive individual.

1139
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:35,631
Mom, please!

1140
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,600
-Just back... just sit down!
-Okay, all right.

1141
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:38,634
Let's take it from the top.

1142
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,503
I'm simply asking
for some kind of cooperation

1143
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,772
and some kind of
professionalism!

1144
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,507
If I could see that!

1145
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,476
-Mom! Please, Mom!
-All right...

1146
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,845
-Just an iota!
-Back off!

1147
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:53,482
Would you just not speak to me
in that kind of voice?!

1148
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,484
I've got the dog
shaking right now.

1149
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,753
I don't need you yelling at me!

1150
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:59,054
Mom, please!

1151
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,590
I am trying to build
some kind of life for you!

1152
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:03,792
If you could just stay out
of it for a minute!

1153
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:04,827
Well, you're ruining it...

1154
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,729
[Rachel]
It went from bad
to disastrous.

1155
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,531
Drew wound up in a shouting
match with his mother.

1156
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:11,900
They called each other
some pretty awful names

1157
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,870
before he finally stormed off
the stage.

1158
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:18,674
And nobody in the orchestra,
including my father,

1159
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,576
could disagree with him.

1160
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,811
[Mrs. Johnson] Michele,
that's a good boy!

1161
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,947
[Rachel]
It was a mess
all right,

1162
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,816
and the end of Drew Johnson,
soloist.

1163
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,886
[Mrs. Johnson]
I've had enough of this circus.

1164
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,462
[chuckling]

1165
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:49,304
Oh, God!

1166
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:55,878
Well, it's not
Sandy Bottom strawberry,

1167
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,813
you know, but it'll pass.

1168
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,815
So what are we going to do?

1169
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:03,452
A week away and no soloist.

1170
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:06,822
I don't know.

1171
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:08,891
I guess we're ruined.

1172
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,595
All right, Norman.
All right, I'll do it!

1173
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:16,098
But it's a lot to ask
any pianist

1174
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,700
to get ready that quickly.

1175
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:18,801
Honey, honey, honey!

1176
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,035
You know the music.

1177
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,538
Knew it! That was years ago!

1178
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:23,972
But you'd have to make
your own meals,

1179
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,607
and, and keep the house
picked up,

1180
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,143
because it's all I could do
to get ready by Labor Day.

1181
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,179
We will cover for you,
right, Rachel?

1182
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,480
Every second!

1183
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,581
Ah! All right, all right!

1184
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,417
Let's get a move on
because there's no time to lose.

1185
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,019
Yes! Yes!

1186
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:38,921
[playing sad tune]

1187
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,015
That's so beautiful.

1188
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:11,954
I didn't know anyone
was listening.

1189
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:15,190
-You mind?
-No.

1190
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,628
So, um...

1191
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,697
how is baseball?

1192
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,732
We're winning more than losing.

1193
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,968
It's fun, I guess.

1194
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,844
Oh, Rache.
I've been such a jerk!

1195
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:40,249
I got so sucked into my team
and my new friends...

1196
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,918
it hit me
that I'd almost lost you.

1197
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:45,487
And...

1198
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,724
you're my very best friend
of all.

1199
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,592
Really?

1200
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,261
[Carol] I don't know anybody
who's cooler than you,

1201
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:55,164
or more talented.

1202
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,866
I just...

1203
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,002
I just miss you.

1204
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,604
-Cooler?
-Yeah.

1205
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,241
Can we hang out some night?

1206
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,976
Just the two of us.

1207
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,912
You know, like we used to.

1208
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:12,281
Tonight be okay?

1209
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,515
Huh?

1210
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,026
Still friends?

1211
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,727
Forever!

1212
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,699
Things are changing though,
aren't they?

1213
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:35,170
A little.
Maybe it's not so bad.

1214
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,175
[Rachel]
We were worried.

1215
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:43,812
It was less than a week away
now and mother still hadn't run

1216
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,747
through the entire concerto.

1217
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,817
It was time for drastic action.

1218
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,020
[Rachel]
How's the Mozart coming?

1219
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,256
Fine. Absolutely fine.

1220
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,861
[Rachel] I thought
you'd be practicing.

1221
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,830
Yeah, well, I started to
and then I noticed how...

1222
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:05,167
really dirty these floors
are and, um...

1223
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,836
I mean, I couldn't practice
with all this dust

1224
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,005
all over the place.

1225
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,174
[Rachel] I could do that
for you, you know.

1226
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,642
Rachel, don't be silly.

1227
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,912
Really, I'm fine.
Just leave me alone, okay?

1228
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:20,949
Please, you're starting
to remind me of your father.

1229
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:22,351
[Rachel] Okay, Mom.

1230
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,086
Thank you.

1231
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,302
Yes, Norman. What is it?
Speak!

1232
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:41,937
[Norman] You need to rehearse.

1233
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,639
You said so yourself.

1234
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,040
Well, you know...

1235
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,142
I know what I said.

1236
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,913
The only problem is...

1237
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:53,115
I can't do it!

1238
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:57,786
Of course you can, honey!

1239
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,155
You've got stage fright,
that's all.

1240
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,324
They love
you,
 Norman!

1241
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:05,827
This whole town thinks the sun
rises over your shoulder.

1242
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:09,164
But they will not accept music
from me!

1243
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:14,136
Well, you haven't even
offered yet!

1244
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,904
Um...

1245
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:24,146
Oh, I got it! You know?

1246
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:27,282
I finally got it, Ingrid.

1247
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:30,185
You are a phony!

1248
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:31,653
What?

1249
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,322
For years you have groused
about not fitting in

1250
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:34,923
in Sandy Bottom. Right?

1251
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,058
Everyone is beneath you!

1252
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:39,895
"Teeny little minds"!
Isn't that what you always say?

1253
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,230
Boy, that sure makes it easy,
doesn't it?

1254
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,233
That way you never have to get
down on their level

1255
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,335
and offer yourself honestly

1256
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:49,972
and actually ask
for their affection.

1257
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:53,375
So in your mind you become this
little lonely island of one!

1258
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:57,279
Sandy Bottom doesn't want me!
They've made that pretty clear!

1259
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:04,786
I'm Sandy Bottom, darling...

1260
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:08,757
And I am no different
than anyone else.

1261
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,294
You know, I work,
I... I raise my kid.

1262
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:14,363
I've tried to make sense
of this crazy world

1263
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:16,164
and I find it comforting

1264
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,400
that there are others like me
up and down these streets,

1265
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,802
trying to do the same thing!

1266
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:27,376
Ingrid, all I have ever wanted
was to do those things with you.

1267
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,415
[bell ringing]

1268
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:45,727
Delia?

1269
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:51,833
[Ingrid weeping]

1270
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,514
[Sykes] For everything
there is a season.

1271
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:08,483
And a time for every matter
under Heaven.

1272
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,618
A time to be born...

1273
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:13,088
[Rachel]
My father said
it sometimes took a death

1274
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:17,125
to remind people how much
they had in common,

1275
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:20,796
how much their lives
depended on each other.

1276
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:24,499
[Sykes] ...and a time to laugh,
a time to mourn.

1277
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,335
And a time to dance.

1278
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,939
[Rachel]
My mother took it
very hard.

1279
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,208
She didn't seem able
to do anything,

1280
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:37,379
much less touch the piano
for two more dark days.

1281
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,251
You've been out here awhile.

1282
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:44,553
Do you need anything?

1283
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,388
No, thank you.

1284
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,524
Yes, come sit with me.

1285
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,939
When I was a little girl,

1286
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,374
your grandfather would take me
out in the backyard

1287
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,176
on summer nights like this.

1288
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:12,347
Just the two of us,
for hours on end.

1289
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:16,084
And he would tell me stories...

1290
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:19,221
about the stars.

1291
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:23,925
Brave Orion, and the Big Bear.

1292
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:26,194
And Andromeda.

1293
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:29,831
And it made me feel so safe.

1294
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,838
What will you remember?

1295
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,508
Um...

1296
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:42,210
the meadows out by the dairy.

1297
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,045
Mm-hmm.

1298
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,916
The smell of Saturday morning
crullers at the bakery.

1299
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:48,984
[giggling]

1300
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:54,489
Um... maple trees, when they
turn that deep gold.

1301
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,629
The way Mrs. Wyman yells hello
from her front porch.

1302
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:02,297
[both chuckling]

1303
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,100
Things like that.

1304
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,602
Well...

1305
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:12,507
I guess Sandy Bottom's
not all bad.

1306
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,409
It's home!

1307
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,484
But I do wonder about
other places.

1308
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:28,256
New York, Boston, London, Paris.

1309
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:33,528
Maybe you can have both?

1310
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:49,211
You know, I'm really sorry
about Mrs. Ferguson.

1311
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,879
Me too.

1312
01:20:56,484 --> 01:21:02,457
Uh... I just thought of
something else I'll remember.

1313
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,526
Your piano playing.

1314
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:06,661
I'm your mother,
you have to say that.

1315
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,496
[giggles]

1316
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,065
No.

1317
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:15,303
When you play...

1318
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:20,242
especially when you think that
no one's listening to you,

1319
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:22,277
when you're happy,

1320
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,381
or sad about something,

1321
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,583
the music you make...

1322
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,986
it's...

1323
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:33,154
it's like your heart's talking.

1324
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:40,562
I've always hoped one day...

1325
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:47,135
that...
I would be able to play...

1326
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:49,571
to feel...

1327
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:51,539
like you do.

1328
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:59,014
That is one of the sweetest
things I've ever heard.

1329
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:02,517
You know that it's a shame

1330
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:07,322
that other people don't get
to hear you play.

1331
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:10,725
Oh, maybe I...

1332
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,362
I really don't have
that much to offer.

1333
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,568
Spoken like a true artist.

1334
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,272
[laughing]

1335
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,743
[sighs]

1336
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,079
I'm going to go to bed.

1337
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:41,623
Rachel?
When did you get so wise?

1338
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,161
Good night.

1339
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,128
[piano playing]

1340
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:53,488
[Rachel]
My mother didn't get
much rest that night,

1341
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:57,459
or the day after that,
or the day after that.

1342
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:01,696
The surprises kept coming
that week.

1343
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,833
On the 2nd of September,
Mr. Bateman,

1344
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,501
the attorney in town,

1345
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:09,838
asked my parents in for
the reading of Delia's will.

1346
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,373
"And my other personal
effects,

1347
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:15,310
including household goods,
to be auctioned.

1348
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:17,846
The proceeds sent to
my brother's family in Duluth.

1349
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:20,381
With one exception:

1350
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:23,685
to Ingrid Green, I leave
my husband's watercolor.

1351
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:25,687
She'll know which one.

1352
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,624
And in her name, I bequeath
a quarter of a million dollars

1353
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,826
for the renovation
and preservation

1354
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,461
of the Ramsey Building..."

1355
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:35,763
-But...
-"...with the understanding

1356
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,699
that at least
part of the building

1357
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:41,269
will be forever maintained
as a food, clothing

1358
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:44,405
and employment center
for people in need.

1359
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,442
I also leave a quarter
of a million dollars

1360
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,744
to the Sandy Bottom
School District,

1361
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:51,379
on the condition

1362
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:54,716
that nothing impede my wishes
for the Ramsey."

1363
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:56,651
[woman gasps]

1364
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,766
[Rachel] 
We got to the park early.

1365
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,003
My father said we could put on
our dresses at the bandshell.

1366
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:26,341
It looked like all of
Sandy Bottom was turning out.

1367
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,878
[Ingrid]
Look at all the cheeses.

1368
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,513
It looks great!

1369
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:34,983
Oh, it looks great!

1370
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:35,984
Oh, look! Rhubarb pie!

1371
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:38,086
-Look at that stuff up there!
-I love rhubarb!

1372
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:40,655
[Rachel] Oh, and blueberry!

1373
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,523
[Ingrid] Your favorite!

1374
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:46,661
And there's a little caterpillar
made out of potatoes.

1375
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:49,664
And there...

1376
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,499
Oh, my goodness.

1377
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:53,034
-Oh, Mom.
-Ingrid.

1378
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:54,836
Hello, Mayor.

1379
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:56,571
Oh, Mrs. Green,

1380
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:59,040
so you got your wish
after all, eh?

1381
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,109
That Delia was a sly one.

1382
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:03,444
I have to say
I didn't see that coming.

1383
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,013
I know you were disappointed.

1384
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,581
Well, sure I am.

1385
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,584
But it's hard to find fault
with a gift like that.

1386
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,519
It wouldn't serve my next
mayoral race.

1387
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:12,353
[laughs]

1388
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:13,721
Always thinking.

1389
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:15,023
[mayor] Name of the game,
Ingrid.

1390
01:28:15,056 --> 01:28:16,991
Well now, well, what about you?

1391
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:18,459
You beat me on the Ramsey,

1392
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:20,094
but I bet you couldn't hit
the broad side

1393
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,963
of a barn with a baseball.

1394
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:24,732
Oh?

1395
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:27,101
Pay the man, Norman.

1396
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,637
[laughs]

1397
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:40,148
[laughs]

1398
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:43,151
[mayor] Somebody get the lady
a basketball.

1399
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:44,852
[laughing]

1400
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,655
Oh, sign her up
for the other team right away.

1401
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:49,724
Aww. [laughs]

1402
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:52,126
[man] Heavy hitter here.

1403
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,162
[ding!]

1404
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:57,432
[cheers and laughter]

1405
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,712
[playing "My Country
'Tis Of Thee"]

1406
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:24,519
[applause and cheers]

1407
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:45,907
Thank you.

1408
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,709
Thank you very much.

1409
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:51,012
And now something we hope really
delights you,

1410
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:54,949
Mozart's A-major
piano concerto, number 23.

1411
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:57,952
We have a change
in the program.

1412
01:30:57,985 --> 01:31:00,121
Due to circumstances beyond
our control,

1413
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:03,858
Mr. Drew Johnson will not be
performing with us this evening.

1414
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:08,996
Instead it gives me
great pleasure to introduce...

1415
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,832
Ingrid Green.

1416
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:14,135
[applause and cheers]

1417
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:30,518
[playing concerto]

1418
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:10,651
[Rachel]
Mother was luminous
that night.

1419
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:14,722
I don't think she ever looked
or sounded more beautiful.

1420
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:22,763
It was as if everything came
together under the stars.

1421
01:34:26,093 --> 01:34:28,462
This was like a dream.

1422
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:29,730
[Scott] Hey, Rachel!

1423
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:31,332
Wait up!

1424
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:32,800
You really were...

1425
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:56,290
What a night.

1426
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:59,160
I know, I'll never forget it.

1427
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:08,369
Well, will you be back at
Mr. Amidore's again this fall?

1428
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,307
Oh, um...

1429
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:14,975
-No.
-No?

1430
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:17,945
Actually, I'm...
I'm going to Interlochen.

1431
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:19,313
If they'll take me.

1432
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,348
No way!

1433
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:27,488
I'm going there too.
I was afraid I'd be lonely.

1434
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:58,953
[laughs]

1435
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:02,223
Oh!

1436
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:04,158
It's great!

1437
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:24,478
It really, really is beautiful.

1438
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:32,386
[Rachel]
In the years ahead,
I did see Paris and London

1439
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,522
and many other
beautiful places.

1440
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:39,493
But I was always glad to return
to my happy parents...

1441
01:36:39,894 --> 01:36:42,530
in the town where we belonged.
