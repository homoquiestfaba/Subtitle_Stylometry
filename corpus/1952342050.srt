WITH THE AGREEMENT OF BOTH PARTIES.

00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:02,309
- I THOUGHT NEEDED SPACE.

13
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,310
- UNSAFE AND PREDICTABLE.
- I LIVE RIGHT HERE.

14
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,310
I HEAR YOU SAY.

15
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,311
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT IMPOSED RULES.

16
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:12,311
I THOUGHT THAT SOME RULES

PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

18

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

23
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:25,314
IT WAS NOT EASY.

24
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,314

00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:43,352
ALWAYS DO SAME THING

00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:47,353
IT IS HIS DUTY. LOOK AT RECEP?IONER.

51
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:08,357
- DO NOT SPEAK FRENCH.

60
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:58,379
UNBELIEVABLE. YOU SEEM SURPRISED
EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT ME.

- DO NOT SPEAK FRENCH.

63
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,381
WHY DO NOT YOU TELL FROM THE BEGINNING?

64
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:09,381
I DO NOT KNOW, WHY DID YOU WATCH?

65
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:12,381
I WALKED TO THE BEACH. YOU REMEMBER?

66
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,382

WELL, HE IS ...
A RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT.

126
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:27,431
A KIND OF PERVERSE.

127
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:31,432
IT HAS SAT NEXT TO ME ON THE PLANE.
DISGUSTING.

128
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:32,432
REALLY?

129
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:33,432
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:35,433
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DISGUSTING?

131
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:38,433
I DO NOT WANT TO EXCHANGE
IF NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

132
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:43,434
I HEARD AND THEY TALKED IN THE ROOM.
VERY STRANGE.

133
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:47,435
- DO YOU HOPE THAT WILL CHANGE THE ROOM.

BUNGEE JUMPING.

136
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:57,437
I DO NOT WANT TO CONTRADICT YOUR HABITS
HAZARDOUS FOOD, BUT ...

137
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,437
BUNGEE JUMPING?

138
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:01,438
NEVER WILL MAKE YOU LOOK SEXY
VOMITING IN PUBLIC.

139
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,439
THAT'S WHAT I SAY AND.

140
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:05,439
- REALLY?
- YES.

141
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,439
YOU SEEM TO FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE HERE

142
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,440

00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:16,441
ALL RIGHT.

146
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:22,442
SO ...

147
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,442
YOU SHOULD ORDER?

148
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:32,444
YOU KNOW WHAT? BETTER GET OUT OF HERE.

149
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:35,445
SERVICES ARE BAD.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU ... NICE.

150
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:45,447
THEY SAY THERE ARE MANY
FUN HERE.

151
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,447
TRUST ME. IT'S BORING.

152
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,450
- WANT MORE?
- OH, NO, NO.

153
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,450
I REALLY DO NOT DRINK SO MUCH.

154
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,451
YOU HAVE TO TAKE MORE EASILY RESIN.

155
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:11,452
WHAT WORK?

156
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:13,452

00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:15,452
I'M A CONSULTANT.

158
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:17,453

SO I HEARD THAT YOU DO NOT WORK ...

328
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:33,585
DO YOU KNOW? JEN IS NOT A
PUPPET OF THE PORCELAIN.

329
00:24:34,585 --> 00:24:35,585
IT'S FUNNY ...

330
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:36,585
... AND IS SWEET AND SMART.

331
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:39,586

SORRY, SORRY, NO ...

STAY HERE.

360
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:01,602
LOOK.

361
00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:05,603
OH, GOD.

00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:06,603
SPENCER ...

363
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:08,603
I HAVE REMODELED THE OFFICE.

364
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:10,604
IT'S SO ORGANIZED.

00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,604
WELCOME ...

366
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,605

HOW ARE SO LUCKY?

368
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:22,606
HOW COME ACROSS SOMEONE LIKE YOU?

369
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:23,606
THAT'S EASY.

370
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:24,606
IT WAS YOUR CHARM.

371
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:26,607
AND YOUR SHOTS.

372
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:30,608
SERIOUSLY, SHOULD NOT I R?SFE?I

373
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,608

IN THIS WEEKEND ... YOUR BIRTHDAY.

375
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:37,609
NO, WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

376
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:39,609
YOU SHOULD NOT DO IN THIS CASE.

377
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:40,610
WITHOUT GIFTS, WITHOUT PARTIES.

378
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,610
IT'S JUST A DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT
WITH MY PARENTS, I PROMISE.

379
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,611
BUT I NEVER AGREED
NOT BE A GIFT.

380
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:49,611
COME SECRECY

381
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:50,612

383
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,613
FLIGHTS TO NICE.

384
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:00,614
I SAID THAT WE CAN RETURN THERE
WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.

385
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:04,614
YOU KNOW? THE BEST PART IS THAT
WE GO WHENEVER WE WANT.

386
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:08,615
BUT BECAUSE I'M WONDERFUL,
I OPEN AT THE END OF THIS MONTH.

387
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:10,615
WHAT?

388
00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:13,616
WE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO YOU?

389
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:14,616
ABSOLUTELY.

390
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:15,616

00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:19,617

HELLO.

405
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:19,629
HEY, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

407
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:22,630
ALL RIGHT.

408
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,630
YES?

409
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,630
AND YOU CAN DRESS AS THEY PLEASE.

410
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,630
PERFECT.

411
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,631
OKAY, ONE MORE.

412
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:29,631
IF THAT MAKES WINGS AND FLY.

413
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:30,631
WONDERFUL.

414
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:32,631
THIS IS LESS OF MY SALIVA.

415
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:33,632
I DO NOT CLONED.

416
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:35,632
WELL, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE LOVE

00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,633
ALL RIGHT.

00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,633
SEE YA.

420
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:41,633
PARTY!

421
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,641
THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE
FOR CUSTOMERS AND INDEX I.

422
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:24,642
WELL, FOLKS, YOU HEARD IT.

423
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:27,642
THERE WE PUT IN PLACE IMMEDIATELY ...
SO ... TO WORK!

424
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,643
JANE!

425
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:34,644
- SHORT AND TO THE POINT! AS ALWAYS.
- THANKS.

426
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:37,644
DO NOT SAY ANYTHING IN SAN FRANCISCO!

427
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,645
- YOU WANT ME TO GO TO CONFERENCE?
- YOU KNOW ...

428
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:44,646

430
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:50,647
MR NOOTBAR TOMORROW E. ..

431
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:55,648
IT'S SO ...
NOT THAT ANYONE ELSE TO SEND?

432
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:05,650
THE CONFERENCE IS IMPORTANT.
I'LL TAKE THE WEEKEND AFTER. WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

433
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,651
OF COURSE THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE.

434
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:17,652
IT'S SO UNPROFESSIONAL TO GO
WITH THINGS INSTEAD OF STAYING WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

435
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,653
AND THEREFORE I HAVE NOT MENTIONED IT.

436
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,653
CAN YOU GET IT TONIGHT OR NOT?
HELLO?

437
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:26,654
DAD?

438
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:29,654
IF YOU NEED ...
I LOVE DULCEA??.

439
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:31,655
AND I LOVE YOU. BYE.

440
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:39,656
NO, IT IS VERY SHORT.

441
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:40,656
YOU CAN MOVE BACK?

442
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:41,657
AN INCH.

443
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:43,657

444
00:30:43,657 --> 00:30:44,657
- HI.

445
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:45,657
PERFECT.

446
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:46,658
CAN YOU COME TOMORROW AGAIN?

447
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:49,658
SORRY, YOU MUST TALK TO THEM.

448
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:52,659
SATURDAY, WITHOUT DRINKS AND MAKING
ACCOUNTING. THE PERFECT TRIO.

449
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:55,659
- SO?
- WELCOME ...

450
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,660
WHAT DO YOU PLAY?

451
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,660
WELL ...

452
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,661
IT IS A PIECE THAT HAS A LOT TO SAY.

453
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:07,662
YES, BUT WE LIKE TO SAY WE
AGATHA GARBAGE CEILING?

454
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:08,662
YES.

455
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:09,662
YES, WHY?

456
00:31:09,662 --> 00:31:13,663
YES, YOU HAVE TRANSFORMED THE CONFERENCE ROOM
A PLACE OF NIGHTMARE.

457
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,663
YES, I KNOW.

458
00:31:14,663 --> 00:31:15,663
HEY, LISTEN, DO ME A FAVOR ...

459
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,664
TAKE A NUMBER OF SOIL SAMPLES
FOR OLIVIA, RIGHT?

460
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,664
AND SOMETHING THAT IS EASY TO CLEAN.

461
00:31:20,664 --> 00:31:22,665
IF WE DECIDE TO DO
SEX ON THE FLOOR.

462
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:23,665
OF COURSE.

463
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:25,665
WORKING ON IT.

464
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,666
- MIRIFIC.
- I LIKE IT MORE WHEN IT IS BAD.

465
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,666
SHOULD YOUR LAWSUIT.

466
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,666
PROBABLY.

467
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,667
BE MAD AT ME, YOU KNOW?

468
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,667
WHEN FLIRTING WITH OTHER WOMEN
BUT THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

469
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,668
DO YOU REALIZE THAT
ONLY HAPPENS IN PORN?

470
00:31:37,668 --> 00:31:38,668
YES.

471
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:40,668
THE BEST PORN MOVIES.

472
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:41,668
I THINK I'LL TRY.

473
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:43,669
ONCE FINISHED OLIVIA
THE DIRTY WORK.

474
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:44,669
THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME.

475
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,669
OLIVIA IS MUCH MORE MALLEABLE
THAN YOU ARE.

476
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:48,670
HEY, PLAYING A BASKETBALL, OR WHAT?

477
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,670
CAN NOT HAVE A SUPPORT WITH JEN.

478
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,671
I THINK I JUST SAW YOUR
BOAS AND THEY ON THE FLOOR.

479
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:55,671
YOU WANT TO COLLECT THEM FOR ME?

480
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:57,672
I HAVE JUST CRUSHED.

481
00:31:57,672 --> 00:32:00,672
DID I JUST BOAS AND CRUSHED THEM
RIGHT THERE.

482
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:01,672
SEE YA.

483
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:04,673
TELL ME THE BOAS AND SMASHING IT,
HENCEFORTH.

484
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:25,677
FRANCE.

485
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:31,678
COME TO SEE ME.

486
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

487
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,680
NOOTBAR SENT ME TO SAN FRANCISCO.

488
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,681
NO, NO, I DO NOT SPEAK
PRESENTATION--

489
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:45,681
ABOUT SPENCER'S GIFT.

490
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:47,681
WHAT DID ABOUT THE TRIP?

491
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:49,682
HE WANTS TO STAY HOME.

492
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:52,682
- DO NOT WANT TO GO ON HOLIDAY?
- DO NOT WANT AN ESCAPE TO FRANCE?

493
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:55,683
- NO.
- WHO WOULD REFUSE SUCH A HOLIDAY?

494
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,683
WELL, SPENCER, IT SEEMS.

495
00:32:57,683 --> 00:32:58,683
OKAY.

496
00:32:58,683 --> 00:32:59,684
ALL RIGHT.

497
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:01,684
HOW LONG HAVE YOU MARRIED?

498
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:02,684
ALREADY ... 3 YEARS?

499
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:03,684
- YES.
- SURE.

500
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:05,685
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

501
00:33:05,685 --> 00:33:06,685
I HAVE A PROBLEM?

502
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:11,686
EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT THE CRISIS
FOR SEVEN YEARS, BUT NONE OF THE 3 YEARS.

503
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:13,686
PEOPLE BECOME DISSATISFIED.

504
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:15,687
STAY QUIET
BUT YOU MUST BE VIGILANT.

505
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:17,687
BECAUSE IF YOU LET IT GROW
A LITTLE HAIR HERE ...

506
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:18,687
AND DOWN THERE ...

507
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:20,688
YOU GET THE FAT IN YOUR JEANS.

508
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:21,688
OKAY?

509
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:24,689
THE NEXT STEP IS DIVORCE, AND HE
GO WITH ONE OF THE REALITY SHOW, SHONDA.

510
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:27,689
OKAY? AND THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE
SAY.

511
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,689
YOU BETTER TAKE CARE THAT
SHONDA SPEAKS SIX LANGUAGES.

512
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:31,690
AND ONE OF THESE LANGUAGES IS SEX.

513
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,690
YOU EAT THAT?

514
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,691
LOOKS GOOD. STARVE.

515
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:03,696
NIGHT BEACH MOTEL

516
00:34:03,696 --> 00:34:04,696
YES ...

517
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:06,697
TRIED TO COMMUNICATE
WITH ONE OF YOUR GUESTS

518
00:34:06,697 --> 00:34:07,697
IT'S CALLED ...

519
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:10,698
SIR?

520
00:34:11,698 --> 00:34:12,698
YES ...

521
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,698
GUEST'S NAME IS ...

522
00:34:15,698 --> 00:34:17,699
ANNABELLA HENSLER.

523
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,699
JUST A MOMENT.

524
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
LOOK  FINALLY. </ I>

525
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,701
MUST MEET. </ I>

526
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,701
THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN, ANNABELLA.

527
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:32,702
YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU LIKE TO
A KIND OF ZOMBIE IN THE SUBURBS ...

528
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:34,702
BUT AS I SAID THREE YEARS AGO. </ I>

529
00:34:34,702 --> 00:34:35,702
NOT LET GO WHEN YOU WANT. </ I>

530
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:37,703
AND LESS IN THIS GAME. </ I>

531
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:38,703
I HAVE A JOB FOR YOU. </ I>

532
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,703
I DO NOT DEAL WITH IT.

533
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,704
YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE
CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

534
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:43,704
POVERTY  MY </ I>

535
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:45,704
IF YOU DO NOT
WILL BE YOUR MISERY. </ I>

536
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:47,705

ALL IS WELL.

677
00:41:43,786 --> 00:41:47,787
MAYBE I CAN GET RID OF PACKAGING
FOOD, EVEN THIS TIME.

678
00:41:47,787 --> 00:41:49,787
YOUR FLIGHT IS THE MORNING

HOWEVER, GOING TO TAKE IT ON SPENCER
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

720
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:11,815
YES.

721
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,815
ALL RIGHT.

722
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:14,815
DADDY HAS PROMISED TO BEHAVE WELL WITH IT?

723
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:17,816
NOT SO MANY WORDS.

724
00:44:19,816 --> 00:44:20,817
YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET ON THE PLANE

725
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:22,817
AND LET US
SPENCER TO TAKE CARE OF, RIGHT?

726
00:44:22,817 --> 00:44:24,817
WELL, CALL WHEN YOU ARRIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO.

727
00:44:24,817 --> 00:44:25,818
I LOVE YOU.

728
00:44:25,818 --> 00:44:26,818
LOVE YOU TOO.

729
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:55,823
- HELLO.
- WHAT IS IT?

730
00:44:57,824 --> 00:44:58,824
ME.

731
00:44:58,824 --> 00:44:59,824
ARE YOU?

732
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:02,825
YOU.

733
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,825
GOT MILK?

734
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:05,825
YES.

735
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:06,826
EVERYTHING OKAY?

736
00:45:06,826 --> 00:45:07,826
YES.

737
00:45:10,826 --> 00:45:13,827
I SKIMMED MILK AND
MINIMUM FAT YOGURT.

738
00:45:14,827 --> 00:45:17,828
WANT OF BOTH?

739
00:45:20,828 --> 00:45:21,829
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

740
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:23,829
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN BEFORE.

741
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:25,829
ALMOST LIKE YOU DID IN YOUR PANTS.

742
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:27,830
YES, IT IS MORE THAN FUNNY.

743
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:33,831
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

744
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,831
KILL YOU, PARTNER.

745
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:56,835
WHERE ARE YOU GOING, SPENCER?

746
00:45:58,836 --> 00:45:59,836
WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS?

747
00:46:35,843 --> 00:46:36,843
SURPRISE!

748
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:37,843
I CAME BACK.

749
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:40,844
SPENCER?

750
00:46:47,845 --> 00:46:49,846
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

751
00:46:51,846 --> 00:46:54,847
WE NEED TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING.

752
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:56,847
UP IN THE BEDSIDE ...

753
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:57,847
- BRING ME THE BLACK 45TH.
- WHAT?

754
00:46:58,848 --> 00:46:59,848
A WEAPON! GO!

755
00:46:59,848 --> 00:47:02,848
- WHY HAVE A GUN?
- GO!

756
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:18,851
- YOU FOUND IT!
- WINE, WINE!

757
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:23,852
NOW, TAKE GUN AND SHOOT HIM IN THE FACE.

758
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:24,853
WHAT?

759
00:47:24,853 --> 00:47:27,853
NO, IT'S CRAZY.

760
00:47:28,853 --> 00:47:30,854
- PULL, PLEASE.
- OKAY.

761
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:35,855
SHIT!

762
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:41,856
ARE YOU CRAZY?

763
00:47:41,856 --> 00:47:43,856
YOU TOLD ME TO SHOOT HIM IN THE FACE.

764
00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:46,857
I THOUGHT THAT ONE COULD DO,
I HAD JUST DISTRACTING.

765
00:47:46,857 --> 00:47:48,857
WHERE SHOULD I HAVE DONE
A SIGN OR SOMETHING!

766
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:51,858
I WAS BUSY
DO NOT KILL ME.

767
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:53,858
I SHOT!

768
00:47:53,858 --> 00:47:57,859
HONEY, YOU NEED TO GO INTO THE CELLAR
AND BRING ME TAPE.

769
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:00,860
GO GET MY BELT.

770
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,860
- I CAN NOT MOVE.
- OKAY.

771
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,861
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE, I GUESS.

772
00:48:13,862 --> 00:48:15,863
SPENCE, WHAT HAPPENS?

773
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:21,864
WE ARE ABOUT TO LEARN.

774
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:24,864
MAKE IT WORSE.

775
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:32,866
SORRY TO BLEED YOUR SEAT.

776
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:34,866
- TOO BAD, HUH?
- YES.

777
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,867
A CONTRACT.

778
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:41,868
A CONTRACT FOR WHAT?
FOR A BUSINESS?

779
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:43,868
SOMEONE HIRED TO KILL ME.

780
00:48:45,868 --> 00:48:46,869
GOD!

781
00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:48,869
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

782
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:51,870
REALLY?
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY INVESTMENT.

783
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,870
I COVERED EACH CUSTOMER
THAT I HAD.

784
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:57,871
I ALWAYS LET GIRLS

785
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:02,872
I WENT AND CLINIC
WHEN YOUR BALLS WERE INFLATED

786
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:04,872
AND WHEN YOU HAD THAT MUSHROOM.

787
00:49:05,872 --> 00:49:08,873
I HELPED TO BURY YOUR DOG.

788
00:49:08,873 --> 00:49:10,873
HEY, IT WAS A GOOD DOG, RIGHT?

789
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:11,873
DO NOT INTERFERE IN IT.

790
00:49:14,874 --> 00:49:17,875
YES? AT THE END OF THE DAY
WILL BE AS DEAD AS HE.

791
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,875
THERE IS A REWARD OF 20 MILLION
ON YOUR HEAD.

792
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:26,876
GOD.

793
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:28,877
YOU OKAY, HONEY?

794
00:49:28,877 --> 00:49:30,877
NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK.

795
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:33,878
BREATHE. ALL RIGHT.

796
00:49:33,878 --> 00:49:35,878
HOW CAN SO WELL?

797
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:36,878
I WILL EXPLAIN ...

798
00:49:37,879 --> 00:49:39,879
NO, YOU EXPLAIN TO ME NOW!
I WANT TO TELL ME RIGHT NOW!

799
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,881
JEN! BEN!
HI!

800
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:51,881
YEAH, MAKES NO NOISE.

801
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:53,882
CAN GO.

802
00:49:55,882 --> 00:49:56,882
CAN BE ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS.

803
00:49:59,883 --> 00:50:00,883
WHAT?

804
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:01,883
I DO NOT THINK ANY COMPETITION?

805
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:04,884
20 MILLION MAY BE
DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL PARTS.

806
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:09,885
YOU CAN SEE THE CAR.

807
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:12,885
IT'S JUST JACKIE VALLERO, SPENCER.

808
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,886
HE JUST WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
PROPERTY OR SOMETHING.

809
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:18,887
OR KILL YOU.

810
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:25,888
HELLO! OPEN THE DOOR.

811
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:29,889
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- COME ON.

812
00:50:31,889 --> 00:50:33,889
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH IT?

813
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:35,890
IF YOU DO NOT KILL WILL COME AFTER US.

814
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,890
- IT'S OUR FRIEND.
- IS A LIAR.

815
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:03,895
WHAT, JEN?

816
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:08,896
- AND THE GUN?
- I THREW IT.

817
00:51:08,896 --> 00:51:10,897
JEN, IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

818
00:51:21,899 --> 00:51:22,899
HELLO.

819
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,900
SLOW DOWN!

820
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,900
STOP THE CAR RIGHT NOW!

821
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,901
- CALM DOWN!
- I HAVE THE RIGHT TO BREATHE ...

822
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:33,901
I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE HELL YOU ARE!

823
00:51:33,901 --> 00:51:35,902
I AM, I JUST
DIFFERENT CURRICULUM.

824
00:51:35,902 --> 00:51:36,902
WHO DO YOU WORK?

825
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:37,902
FOR THE MAFIA?

826
00:51:38,902 --> 00:51:39,902
IF SAY, YOU COULD BE KILLED.

827
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:44,903
LET'S SAY I WORK FOR BLAH BLAH BLAH

828
00:51:44,903 --> 00:51:46,904
AND GAVE ME A LICENSE TO BLAH.

829
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:49,904
I NEED AIR, NOW!

830
00:51:49,904 --> 00:51:51,905
HONEY, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

831
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:53,905
WE GOT MARRIED?

832
00:51:53,905 --> 00:51:55,906
YES, WE'RE MARRIED.

833
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:58,906
- LOVE MATCH?
- I GAVE IN FRANCE.

834
00:51:58,906 --> 00:52:01,907
I CONQUERED
WHILE YOU WERE AT WORK?

835
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:14,909
HERE IS YOUR END,
SPENCE.

836
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:18,910
SPREAD YOUR LEGS.

837
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,910
YOU WILL NOT GET SO EASILY.

838
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:24,911
GOD.

839
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:26,912
HERE, TAKE THIS.

840
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:29,912
BRACE YOURSELF.

841
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:49,916
IT'S ON MY SIDE! IT'S ON MY SIDE!

842
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:24,923
- DAMN.
- I LOST.

843
00:53:25,923 --> 00:53:27,923
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YES.

844
00:53:27,923 --> 00:53:29,924
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

845
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:42,926
- HIDE!
- WHAT?

846
00:53:42,926 --> 00:53:43,927
HIDE.

847
00:53:48,928 --> 00:53:49,928
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

848
00:53:49,928 --> 00:53:50,928
I WILL KILL HIM.

849
00:55:28,947 --> 00:55:29,947
GET IN THE CAR.

850
00:55:30,948 --> 00:55:32,948
- IT'S ...
- YES.

851
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:38,949
START TALKING.

852
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,951
I WAS RECRUITED FIRST
YEAR OF COLLEGE.

853
00:55:47,951 --> 00:55:49,951
WHY DID YOU CHOSE?

854
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:51,952
PEOPLE SEEKING INDEPENDENT
MY PARENTS DIED,

855
00:55:52,952 --> 00:55:54,952
I HAD NO FAMILY.

856
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:00,953
WE MUST MAKE A MOVE.

857
00:56:02,954 --> 00:56:04,954
YOU CLIMB INTO THE CAR, TO ARGUE.

858
00:56:05,954 --> 00:56:07,955
ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME?

859
00:56:07,955 --> 00:56:11,956
IF I WANTED TO DO THIS
ONE AT HOME.

860
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,956
SOUNDS WEIRD ...

861
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,957
LOGICALLY, YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE.

862
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:20,957
YEAH, RIGHT.

863
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:31,959
- SPREAD YOUR LEGS.
- HOW MANY THINGS DO YOU HAVE ON HERE?

864
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,961
HOW MANY PEOPLE, SPENCER?

865
00:56:42,962 --> 00:56:48,963
4 ... AND 9, 50.

866
00:56:51,963 --> 00:56:53,964
IT'S ALL RIGHT,

867
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:54,964
OR IS THAT WHEN YOU GUYS
WRITE THE BOOK WITH MANY WOMEN

868
00:56:54,964 --> 00:56:57,964
YOU HAD SEX AND MULTIPLY BY 10?

869
00:56:59,965 --> 00:57:00,965
I HAVE NOT DONE SO.

870
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:03,966
50 IS MY NUMBER.

871
00:57:05,966 --> 00:57:07,966
THEY WERE BAD GUYS,
FAR AS I KNOW.

872
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,967
IT WAS HARD TO TELL

873
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:14,968
THEN I MET YOU,
I LOVE AND I GAVE UP.

874
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:23,970
YESTERDAY I WAS CONTACTED BY A GUY.

875
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,970
GO TO A HOTEL.

876
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,971
YOU DISCOVER WHAT HAPPENED.

877
00:57:44,974 --> 00:57:45,974
HONEY, YOU CAN SEE THE GUN.

878
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:47,974
WHERE DO THEY KEEP HER?

879
00:57:47,974 --> 00:57:49,975
YOU SEE WHAT SIZE IS THIS?

880
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:10,979
S FATHER, TO RESPOND?

881
00:58:19,981 --> 00:58:21,981
I THOUGHT YOU CHANGED IT.

882
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:28,982
RELAX, DEAR.

883
00:58:29,982 --> 00:58:31,983
IT'S PRETTY EARLY TO CHECK IT
BY SPENCER, DO NOT YOU THINK?

884
00:58:32,983 --> 00:58:35,984
AND JEN IS JUST PLACES A HOTEL.

885
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:38,984
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

886
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,988
SPENCER, I FOUND THIS.

887
00:59:15,991 --> 00:59:18,992
EASY, IS MY FORMER BOSS.

888
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:23,993
ONE HEART AND ONE HEAD.

889
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:26,994
THE ASSASSIN WAS TRAINED
MUST LOOK ONLY TO MUSCLE.

890
00:59:30,994 --> 00:59:33,995
IN SUCH STATES,
DEAD JUST A FEW HOURS.

891
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:37,996
COME SEE WHAT'S THERE.

892
00:59:37,996 --> 00:59:39,996
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW HIM?

893
00:59:40,996 --> 00:59:43,997
ARE TRAINED, BABY.
SORRY.

894
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:49,998
I CAN SIT HERE
SPENCER. I DO NOT FEEL WELL.

895
00:59:50,998 --> 00:59:51,998
YET ONE SECOND, SWEETIE.

896
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:54,999
I NEED TO KNOW INFORMATION ABOUT THE TARGET.

897
00:59:56,999 --> 01:00:01,000
- CAN NOT LOOK RIGHT PLACE.
- WHAT HAVE I MISSED?

898
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:08,002
CLOCK! IS WRONG.

899
01:00:13,003 --> 01:00:15,003
MUST HAVE LEFT A TRACE,
WITHOUT NOTICE.

900
01:00:18,004 --> 01:00:22,004
- LOOK AT THIS.
- IT'S BROKEN. WITH HIS CARES?

901
01:00:24,005 --> 01:00:27,005
- MISSING A PART OF IT.
- RIGHT.

902
01:00:32,006 --> 01:00:34,007
OKAY, LET'S GO.

903
01:00:43,008 --> 01:00:47,009
- DO YOU THINK HENRY DID?
- THE CONTRACT WAS MADE THIS MORNING.

904
01:00:48,009 --> 01:00:49,010
IT WAS ANOTHER KILLER IN THE HOUSE.

905
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:51,010
I THINK WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.

906
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,010
- ABSOLUTELY.
- GO HOME TO MY PARENTS.

907
01:00:54,011 --> 01:00:55,011
YES.

908
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:57,011
DAD KNOWS WHAT TO DO.

909
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:59,012
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

910
01:01:00,012 --> 01:01:03,012
I DO NOT WANT TO INVOLVE YOUR PARENTS.
I NEED THE HELP OF YOUR FATHER.

911
01:01:03,012 --> 01:01:04,013
I THINK YES.

912
01:01:04,013 --> 01:01:08,013
BECAUSE YOUR PLANS
FAILS.

913
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:12,014
I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO INVOLVE YOUR PARENTS IN IT.

914
01:01:12,014 --> 01:01:14,014
ARE YOU A SPY AND DOUBLE AGENT

915
01:01:14,014 --> 01:01:16,015
AND I'M BAD NOW, BECAUSE
I INVOLVE PARENTS, REALLY?

916
01:01:17,015 --> 01:01:21,016
WE WERE MARRIED FOR THREE YEARS, AND NEVER
I HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM YOUR PARENTS.

917
01:01:21,016 --> 01:01:23,016
ARE ALWAYS AT HOME

918
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:26,017
AND YOUR FATHER ALWAYS TELLS US
WHY AND HOW TO DO IT.

919
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:29,017
MUST BUY
THE DISHWASHER,

920
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:35,019
OR GRASS CUTTING IT THAT WAY.

921
01:01:35,019 --> 01:01:36,019
STOP, TALK
ABOUT MY PARENTS.

922
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:38,019
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

923
01:01:39,019 --> 01:01:41,020
WHAT WE DO
WHEN TO HAVE CHILDREN?

924
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:49,021
TALK TO ME.

925
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:51,022
WITHDRAW WHAT I SAID,
I LIKE YOUR PARENTS.

926
01:01:51,022 --> 01:01:54,022
ARE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE,
RIGHT NOW.

927
01:01:54,022 --> 01:01:58,023
- HEY, SPENCER, ARE YOU OKAY?
- YES.

928
01:01:58,023 --> 01:02:01,024
YOUR GARAGE IS A MESS.

929
01:02:01,024 --> 01:02:03,024
YES, WE HAD A PARTY AND ...

930
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:07,025
WE HAVE A PARTY TONIGHT
AND INDICATED THAT ...

931
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:09,025
DO NOT FORGET, PETE.

932
01:02:16,027 --> 01:02:18,027
YOU CAN NOT RUN SO

933
01:02:18,027 --> 01:02:20,027
BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO
TO PROTECT YOU.

934
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,028
IT'S A BIT LATE FOR PROTECTION.

935
01:02:25,028 --> 01:02:28,029
MY EMOTIONS COME TO LIGHT
THROUGH EVERY PORE,

936
01:02:28,029 --> 01:02:31,030
I FEEL ALL SORTS OF SMELLS,

937
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,030
AND I FEEL LIKE VOMIT
EVERY BREATH.

938
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,031
- IT WAS A STRESSFUL DAY.
- MY KNEES ...

939
01:02:40,031 --> 01:02:41,031
THEY ARE ALWAYS SO?

940
01:02:44,032 --> 01:02:45,032
TAKE THE PILL EVERY DAY.

941
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:47,033
I KNOW, BUT I MADE A BREAK
LAST WEEK, REMEMBER?

942
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:49,033
SINCE I TOLD YOU THAT MAKE A BREAK
WITH THE REST OF THE PILLS

943
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:52,034
WAS CLEAR THAT IT OUGHT
TO BE CAREFUL.

944
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,034
I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MY TECHNIQUE
AND TO NOT LEAVE YOU PREGNANT.

945
01:02:54,034 --> 01:02:56,034
DO NOT YELL AT ME.

946
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:58,035
IT WAS YOU WHO SUGGESTED
S DO SATURDAY.

947
01:03:00,035 --> 01:03:01,035
CAN WE HELP YOU?

948
01:03:02,036 --> 01:03:03,036
- STOP.
- WHAT?

949
01:03:04,036 --> 01:03:06,036
STARE AT US!

950
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:09,037
WE ARE NOT IN LIBRARY
TAKE ONE AND DONE.

951
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:11,037
NOT ALL ARE CORRECT.

952
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,038
IT'S CRAZY TO SIT HERE

953
01:03:13,038 --> 01:03:15,038
TAKE ONE OR ALL, WHO CARES?

954
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:17,039
I CARE, SPENCE,

955
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,039
WOULD BE GREAT TO KNOW ...

956
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,039
IT'S A BABY IN ME.

957
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:23,040
DO NOT MAKE ME MAD.

958
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
YOU ARE NOT CRAZY
SCENARIO THIS IS CRAZY.

959
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,041
- TO SIT HERE ...
- DO NOT HELP ME AT ALL.

960
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:31,041
CAN I HELP YOU?

961
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,042
YES, YES, YOU ...

962
01:03:36,042 --> 01:03:39,043
WHICH OF THESE TESTS IS MOST ACCURATE?

963
01:03:40,043 --> 01:03:42,043
I DO NOT THINK THAT IS AN EXPERT
THE PREGNANCY TEST.

964
01:03:46,044 --> 01:03:48,045
WELL, "FIRST RESPONSE"
IS VERY POPULAR.

965
01:03:49,045 --> 01:03:52,045
YOU CAN TRY IT.

966
01:03:55,046 --> 01:03:56,046
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- A PREGNANCY TEST?

967
01:03:57,046 --> 01:03:59,047
- CHILD.
- YES.

968
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,048
THAT MAY BE YOUR LUCKY DAY.

969
01:04:08,048 --> 01:04:09,049
STOP.

970
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:11,049
REMEMBER, IT'S FOR SALE.

971
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,050
WONDERFUL. IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.

972
01:04:20,051 --> 01:04:21,051
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

973
01:04:28,052 --> 01:04:29,053
WITHOUT TRIAL.

974
01:04:30,053 --> 01:04:33,053
MUST FOLLOW A PROTOCOL
FOR THIS.

975
01:04:34,054 --> 01:04:36,054
WE GO TO A SAFE PLACE.

976
01:04:37,054 --> 01:04:40,055
I FIND
WHICH WAS THE TARGET.

977
01:04:41,055 --> 01:04:43,055
TO FIND OUT WHO CAUSED ALL THIS.

978
01:04:44,056 --> 01:04:46,056
ONCE ABLE TO URINATE,
COUNT ON ME.

979
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:51,057
ONE MORE THING.

980
01:04:52,057 --> 01:04:55,058
AND DO NOT MIND,
BUT TO STEAL A CAR.

981
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,058
NO BOTHER.

982
01:04:57,058 --> 01:05:00,059
THERE'S SOMETHING WE DO DAILY.
GO AHEAD.

983
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,060
I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT IS SO HUNGRY.

984
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,061
YOU HAVE ALREADY SAID.

985
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:13,061
REALLY?

986
01:05:14,061 --> 01:05:16,062
TO EAT SO MUCH
AND IT SEEMS A GOOD IDEA?

987
01:05:16,062 --> 01:05:18,062
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE SCARED.

988
01:05:22,063 --> 01:05:24,063
YOUR NAME CONTACT.

989
01:05:24,063 --> 01:05:29,064

WAS CALLED FOR A CONTRACT.

990
01:05:29,064 --> 01:05:31,065
PLEASE TELL US
SAFE MEETING PLACE.

991
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:33,065
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

992
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:37,066
"SEUDO149?"

993
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,066
THAT'S MY CODE NAME.

994
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:42,067
NOT SO APPEALING.

995
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:46,068
SORRY, KORN WAS ALREADY TAKEN.

996
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:50,068
SEUDO149 CONFIRM CONTACT
AND STATE WHERE YOU ARE.

997
01:05:50,068 --> 01:05:54,069
0010 AND THE STATE IS ZERO

998
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:56,070
AND I THINK THEIR GOAL
I BECAME.

999
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:59,070
NEGATIVE.
0010 HAS NO TARGET.

1000
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,071
THERE IS AN ACTIVE AGENT.

1001
01:06:01,071 --> 01:06:03,071
PLEASE GO TO LOCATION
AND WAIT.

1002
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:10,072
WHAT HAPPENED?

1003
01:06:10,072 --> 01:06:11,073
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

1004
01:06:12,073 --> 01:06:13,073
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

1005
01:06:13,073 --> 01:06:16,073
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE I COULD FIND

1006
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:19,074
AND YOU CAN PEE.

1007
01:06:27,076 --> 01:06:28,076
WE MANAGED, ARE INSIDE.

1008
01:06:29,076 --> 01:06:31,076
ALL RIGHT.

1009
01:06:31,076 --> 01:06:37,078
HORN, HORN.

1010
01:07:17,085 --> 01:07:19,086
THAT WAS THE FIRST LEFT-PARTY
THAT WE WERE MET HIM.

1011
01:07:22,086 --> 01:07:26,087
WHO DID THIS HAD SUFFICIENT PATIENCE
AS TO DOCUMENT MY LIFE.

1012
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:27,087
- OUR LIFE.
- OUR LIFE.

1013
01:07:36,089 --> 01:07:38,089
I'M PRETTY SURE
YOUR FATHER HAS TO DO WITH IT.

1014
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:44,091
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- HMM. JUST AN OBSERVATION.

1015
01:07:44,091 --> 01:07:46,091
YES, A REMARK ABOUT
MY FATHER AND THAT PHOTO.

1016
01:07:47,091 --> 01:07:49,092
SINCE IT IS A PICTURE THAT HE TAKE.

1017
01:07:49,092 --> 01:07:52,092
SO, NOW MY FATHER IS A BAD GUY.

1018
01:07:52,092 --> 01:07:54,093
- ABSOLUTELY ...
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1019
01:07:54,093 --> 01:07:57,093
YOU ARE A LIAR
AND OTHERS.

1020
01:07:58,093 --> 01:08:01,094
WELL, MY MOTHER HAS A CORNFIELD

1021
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:04,095
AND I THINK FOOLISHLY
EVERYONE WITH A WHEELCHAIR.

1022
01:08:05,095 --> 01:08:07,095
I THINK WE'RE IN A TERRITORY
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

1023
01:08:08,095 --> 01:08:09,096
AND I THINK SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN,

1024
01:08:10,096 --> 01:08:13,096
MAYBE WE CAN SEE THE RESULT
TEST NOW.

1025
01:08:14,097 --> 01:08:16,097
VERY GOOD
THEY HAVE TO PEE.

1026
01:08:16,097 --> 01:08:17,097
GET MY GUN.

1027
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:20,098
SIMPLY CAN NOT LEAVE ...

1028
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:24,098
- PEOPLE TRYING TO KILL US.
- YOU MUST GO TO THE BATHROOM.

1029
01:08:28,099 --> 01:08:29,099
WAIT.

1030
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:35,101
JUST OPEN THE DOOR,
'RE PARANOID.

1031
01:08:39,101 --> 01:08:40,102
JUST A MOMENT.

1032
01:08:56,105 --> 01:08:58,105
I CAN NOT PEE IF YOU STAY THERE.

1033
01:08:58,105 --> 01:09:00,106
YOU DID A THOUSAND TIMES.

1034
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:02,106
BUT NOW THERE ARE MORE
PRESSURE, DO NOT YOU THINK?

1035
01:09:08,107 --> 01:09:09,107
BETTER?

1036
01:09:28,111 --> 01:09:30,111
HONEY, PLEASE, LEAVE A MINUTE.

1037
01:09:30,111 --> 01:09:33,112
IT WILL NOT LAST LONG, CLOSING THE DOOR.

1038
01:09:58,117 --> 01:10:00,117
- HI.
- HI.

1039
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:02,118
- ARE YOU HERE.
- AND YOU.

1040
01:10:03,118 --> 01:10:05,118
THERE WAS A PROBLEM
WINKHIGH ACCOUNT.

1041
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:09,119
CUSTOMERS WERE CALLED TWICE
MAY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK A LOOK.

1042
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:12,120
FORGET ACCOUNT.

1043
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,120
I GOT THIS MONTH.

1044
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,120
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YES.

1045
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:19,121
- OKAY.

1046
01:12:20,145 --> 01:12:22,145

1047
01:12:23,145 --> 01:12:24,145
STOP!

1048
01:12:30,147 --> 01:12:32,147
HONEY, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, DO NOT SHOOT.

1049
01:12:33,147 --> 01:12:34,147
GOD.

1050
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:53,151
ARE YOU OKAY?

1051
01:12:56,152 --> 01:12:58,152
ARE YOU OKAY?

1052
01:13:00,152 --> 01:13:01,153
HAD NO AMMUNITION.

1053
01:13:05,153 --> 01:13:06,154
I DID IT FOR THE GOOD OF THE CHILD.

1054
01:13:08,154 --> 01:13:10,154
THAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

1055
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:13,155
LET'S SEE, WHAT SAY?

1056
01:13:17,156 --> 01:13:18,156
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

1057
01:13:20,156 --> 01:13:21,156
I HAVE TO TRANSLATE IT.

1058
01:13:25,157 --> 01:13:27,158
I'LL BE DAD?

1059
01:13:27,158 --> 01:13:29,158
A MOTHER TO SON.

1060
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:31,158
NOT SURE IF YOU GONNA BE A FATHER.

1061
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,161
I KNOW YOU MAD,

1062
01:13:42,161 --> 01:13:44,161
AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE,

1063
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:45,161
BUT CAN NOT CHANGE WHAT I WAS.

1064
01:13:46,161 --> 01:13:47,162
WHERE WE CHOSE NOT TO BE IN NOVEMBER?

1065
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:50,162

1066
01:13:50,162 --> 01:13:51,162

S OVER, SPENCE.

1069
01:14:06,165 --> 01:14:08,166
I KNOW YOU DO NOT WANT TO END.

1070
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:11,166
I DROPPED WHAT I WANT
WHEN I SAW THE TEST RESULT.

1071
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:21,168
WHERE YOU GOING?

1072
01:14:49,174 --> 01:14:51,174
OLIVIA.

1073
01:15:03,176 --> 01:15:05,177
LET'S SEE WHO'S CALLING, HENRY.

1074
01:15:09,178 --> 01:15:11,178
MUST BE A JOKE.

1075
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:18,179
WE HAVE A DELIVERY FOR YOU, SPENCER.

1076
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,181
RELAX, BUDDY.

1077
01:15:24,181 --> 01:15:25,181
COME ON, GIVE ME A HELPING HAND.

1078
01:15:33,182 --> 01:15:35,183
APPEARS TO BE FROM A FACTORY IN TULSA.

1079
01:15:37,183 --> 01:15:38,183
YOU EXPECT?

1080
01:15:40,184 --> 01:15:41,184
YES.

1081
01:15:44,184 --> 01:15:46,185
PUT YOUR SIGNATURE IN THE UPPER RIGHT.

1082
01:15:47,185 --> 01:15:50,186
HELP?

1083
01:16:20,191 --> 01:16:23,192
- I THINK I'VE FINISHED.
- YES.

1084
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:25,192
THANK GOD YOU'RE OKAY.

1085
01:16:25,192 --> 01:16:27,193
LOOK AT THE WINDSHIELD.

1086
01:16:27,193 --> 01:16:28,193
YOU REALLY UPSET.

1087
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:44,196
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT
TRYING TO KILL ME?

1088
01:17:25,204 --> 01:17:27,205
THANK YOU.

1089
01:17:29,205 --> 01:17:31,205
LET'S GO STEAL A CAR.

1090
01:17:36,206 --> 01:17:37,206
NOW WHAT?

1091
01:17:38,207 --> 01:17:39,207
I DO NOT KNOW.

1092
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:44,208
I THINK OF SOMETHING.

1093
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:50,209
WHAT WE DO NOW, SPENCER?

1094
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:53,210
NOW GO HOME

1095
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,210
HAVE MONEY, WEAPONS,
PASSPORT. ALL PREPARED.

1096
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:58,211
WHY SHOULD WE RETURN, SPENCER?

1097
01:17:58,211 --> 01:18:00,211
YOU KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN?

1098
01:18:01,211 --> 01:18:04,212
- THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY.
- YOU ARE A LIAR.

1099
01:18:05,212 --> 01:18:06,212
YOU LIAR!

1100
01:18:06,212 --> 01:18:07,212
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING?

1101
01:18:08,213 --> 01:18:09,213
NO, I SAID EVERYTHING.

1102
01:18:09,213 --> 01:18:12,213
BUT WE'RE MARRIED
THOSE THAT ARE MARRIED.

1103
01:18:12,213 --> 01:18:15,214
THEY TELL LIES, TELLING PEOPLE
THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE

1104
01:18:15,214 --> 01:18:18,214
TO PROTECT EACH OTHER

1105
01:18:18,214 --> 01:18:22,215
WHEN ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE
"IF THEIR MOTHERS ARMS.

1106
01:18:24,216 --> 01:18:26,216
NOT YOUR MOTHER'S ARMS.

1107
01:18:26,216 --> 01:18:28,216
YOU LIED FROM DAY ONE
WHEN WE MET!

1108
01:18:28,216 --> 01:18:29,217
I DID NOT.

1109
01:18:29,217 --> 01:18:31,217
EXCEPT WHEN YOUR FATHER
RUSSIAN WAS PERVERSE.

1110
01:18:32,217 --> 01:18:33,217
WELL, AFTER I TOLD THE TRUTH.

1111
01:18:33,217 --> 01:18:35,218
YOU'VE NEVER TOLD!

1112
01:18:35,218 --> 01:18:36,218
AND I CONFESSED.

1113
01:18:37,218 --> 01:18:38,218
I KNEW THAT SLEEP.

1114
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:40,219
I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU SLEEP LIKE A DEAD MAN.

1115
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:44,220
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

1116
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,220
BASED ON WHAT?

1117
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,220
BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED AFTER.

1118
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,221
PERFECT.

1119
01:18:50,221 --> 01:18:52,221
YOU COULD NOT HIDE IN THE BASEMENT

1120
01:18:53,221 --> 01:18:55,222
THAT SUSAN'S HUSBAND?

1121
01:18:56,222 --> 01:18:58,222
WHO?

1122
01:18:58,222 --> 01:19:01,223
THERE HAD TO BE A SPY.

1123
01:19:02,223 --> 01:19:04,223
I CAN NOT BELIEVE
THAT I MARRIED A SPY.

1124
01:19:04,223 --> 01:19:07,224
- WHO AM I, PUSSY ODOR?
- NO, I KNOW OF.

1125
01:19:08,224 --> 01:19:09,224
EXCUSE ME?

1126
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:12,225
ARE YOU GOING TO COMPLAIN
OUR SEX LIFE NOW?

1127
01:19:12,225 --> 01:19:14,225
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO?

1128
01:19:14,225 --> 01:19:16,226
STOP THE CAR!
LET'S HAVE SEX NOW!

1129
01:19:17,226 --> 01:19:18,226
GO HOME TO MY PARENTS.

1130
01:19:19,226 --> 01:19:22,227
- DO NOT GO HOME TO YOUR PARENTS.
- YES, GO.

1131
01:19:22,227 --> 01:19:23,227
I SAID YES!

1132
01:19:23,227 --> 01:19:28,228
WE CAN NOT GO TO YOUR PARENTS.
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

1133
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:33,229
I LOVE U
AND I WILL PROTECT U.

1134
01:19:33,229 --> 01:19:35,230
I DID A GOOD JOB
I FOUND THE CAR

1135
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:38,230
NOW GO TO OUR HOME.

1136
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,231
ALL RIGHT.

1137
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:47,232
ANYWAY, I COULD NOT GO
MACHINE FAILS.

1138
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:11,237
DO NOT YOU SEE THAT LIGHT
MOMENTS OF THE FUEL?

1139
01:20:13,237 --> 01:20:14,237
YES, I APOLOGIZE.

1140
01:20:15,237 --> 01:20:17,238
CHECKING CONTAINER
WAS MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

1141
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:24,239
RUN!

1142
01:20:47,244 --> 01:20:48,244
SORRY.

1143
01:20:53,245 --> 01:20:55,245
STOP SHOOTING!

1144
01:20:57,246 --> 01:20:59,246
- I MISSED!
- REALLY?

1145
01:21:15,249 --> 01:21:16,249
TAKE CARE, MY HONEY!

1146
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:31,252
- COME ON.
- WHAT MISERY!

1147
01:21:37,253 --> 01:21:38,254
DAMN.
I FORGOT THE PARTY.

1148
01:21:39,254 --> 01:21:41,254
STAY CLOSE. KEEP GOING.

1149
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:19,262
HELLO, YOU ARRIVED?

1150
01:22:20,262 --> 01:22:23,262
WHERE TO GO?
WE HAVE HOT DOGS.

1151
01:22:23,262 --> 01:22:26,263
WE HAVE BABY CLOTHES TOO.

1152
01:22:26,263 --> 01:22:28,263
HE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT.

1153
01:22:29,264 --> 01:22:31,264
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW PEOPLE
THINGS ARE.

1154
01:22:32,264 --> 01:22:34,264
IF YOU WANT, USE THE TOILET IN THE HOUSE.

1155
01:22:37,265 --> 01:22:39,265
- HOW ARE THINGS?
- IN THE OFFICE.

1156
01:22:39,265 --> 01:22:41,266
STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS.

1157
01:22:41,266 --> 01:22:43,266
SAFE IS THE FLOOR

1158
01:22:43,266 --> 01:22:45,267
CODE IS EVEN GIVEN OUR ANNIVERSARY.

1159
01:22:45,267 --> 01:22:47,267
- WHERE YOU GOING?
- TO TAKE ARMS.

1160
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:51,268
WEAPONS, MORE WEAPONS?
WONDERFUL.

1161
01:23:19,273 --> 01:23:24,274
TED WALDFRIEDZEN?
OH, SWEDISH.

1162
01:23:32,276 --> 01:23:34,276
SPENCE, YOU ARE?

1163
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,280
SPENCER YOU?

1164
01:23:59,281 --> 01:24:01,281
GOD, MOM.

1165
01:24:02,282 --> 01:24:04,282
NOW IS A TIME NOT TOO GOOD.

1166
01:24:05,282 --> 01:24:06,282
DO YOU?

1167
01:24:11,283 --> 01:24:15,284
KRISTIN?
NOT REALLY MAKES NO SENSE.

1168
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:18,285
PUT THE GUN DOWN
IS THE LAST COFFEE DRINKING MOTHER.

1169
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:47,290
I TOLD YOU, THERE'S A PRETTY GIRL.

1170
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:49,291
- DO YOU?
- VERY CRUEL.

1171
01:24:54,292 --> 01:24:56,292
- DAMN! WHO IS THERE?
- DO NOT KNOW.

1172
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,293
IF YOU SHOOT SOMEONE
MR. PERFECT BEFORE ME ...

1173
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:01,293
... KILL YOU BOTH, IN PRINCIPLE.

1174
01:25:02,293 --> 01:25:04,294
DROP IT NOW!

1175
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:21,297
MY LEG.

1176
01:25:28,298 --> 01:25:31,299
LET HER MOTHER LEAVE.
I GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

1177
01:25:31,299 --> 01:25:33,299
I SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS
LISTENING TO YOU ...

1178
01:25:33,299 --> 01:25:39,301
AS THE STORY OF YOUR LIFE PERFECT
TO QUIT RIGHT NOW.

1179
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:42,301
MOVE THE LIVING ROOM, BOTH
LET.

1180
01:25:43,301 --> 01:25:44,302
LET'S GO!

1181
01:25:48,302 --> 01:25:49,303
COME BACK!

1182
01:25:55,304 --> 01:25:57,304
JEN, TO BE HONEST,

1183
01:25:58,304 --> 01:26:00,305
- I SPENT BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS TOGETHER.
- YES.

1184
01:26:05,306 --> 01:26:06,306
THERE YOU ARE, DEAR.

1185
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:12,307
ANSWER YOUR PHONE, SIR.

1186
01:26:13,307 --> 01:26:16,308
MY BEST FRIEND IS DEAD
AND YOU CAN SAY THAT TARGET IS ALIVE.

1187
01:26:17,308 --> 01:26:19,308
PUT THE GUN DOWN, SPENCER.

1188
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:20,309
HEY, GUYS ...

1189
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,309
HE KILLED MY BOSS.

1190
01:26:23,309 --> 01:26:24,309
A BLOW TO THE HEAD, REMEMBER?

1191
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:31,311
AND THEN TRIED TO KILL ME.

1192
01:26:33,311 --> 01:26:34,311
DADDY, IS THIS TRUE?

1193
01:26:35,312 --> 01:26:36,312
I MIXED IN YOUR LIFE

1194
01:26:36,312 --> 01:26:38,312
BECAUSE I TRUSTED
IN YOUR HUSBAND.

1195
01:26:39,312 --> 01:26:41,313
I HOPED TO USE IT AGAIN.

1196
01:26:42,313 --> 01:26:45,314
IT'S NO PIECE OF THE CLOCK.

1197
01:26:45,314 --> 01:26:46,314
EVERYTHING IS THERE.

1198
01:26:46,314 --> 01:26:48,314
ALL THE DIRTY WORK,

1199
01:26:49,314 --> 01:26:51,315
AND IN THE OFFICE WHEN I SAW
POSTCARD WITH NAME WRITTEN ON IT,

1200
01:26:52,315 --> 01:26:54,315
I KNEW YOU BACK IN GAME

1201
01:26:54,315 --> 01:26:55,315
AND THAT WILL COME AFTER ME.

1202
01:26:59,316 --> 01:27:01,317
SO I ENABLED CRIMINALS.

1203
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:03,317
DO NOT TRY TO KILL YOU, SIR.

1204
01:27:04,317 --> 01:27:06,318
WHY NOT TELL ABOUT NICE
WHEN YOU TRIED TO GET MY BRAINS?

1205
01:27:07,318 --> 01:27:08,318
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT NICE?

1206
01:27:08,318 --> 01:27:10,318
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THAT HELICOPTER.

1207
01:27:11,319 --> 01:27:12,319
BUT I SAW THAT YOU DROPPED.

1208
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,320
YOU SAID YOU WAIVED
WHEN WE MET IN FRANCE.

1209
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,321
YOU SAID YOU WERE IN LOVE.

1210
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:22,321
I GAVE UP.

1211
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:25,321
LOOK AT HIM
LOOKS AS IF ABANDONED?

1212
01:27:25,321 --> 01:27:27,322
IT WAS MY LAST JOB,
I'M OUT.

1213
01:27:27,322 --> 01:27:31,323
I GET OUT ... FOR US!

1214
01:27:34,323 --> 01:27:36,323
AND NEVER GONNA COME BACK.

1215
01:27:50,326 --> 01:27:54,327
SO YOU'RE NOT A PILOT?

1216
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:58,328
PRETTY FATHER PUT THE GUN DOWN,

1217
01:27:58,328 --> 01:28:00,328
I SNIFF BULLETS ALL DAY

1218
01:28:00,328 --> 01:28:02,329
AND NOT GOOD FOR CHILDREN.

1219
01:28:02,329 --> 01:28:04,329
- HAVE A CHILD?
- NO, I WILL.

1220
01:28:06,329 --> 01:28:07,330
TO CELEBRATE.

1221
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:09,330
- I BECOME A GRANDFATHER?
- YES.

1222
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,331
GOD.

1223
01:28:18,332 --> 01:28:19,332
GOD.

1224
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:21,332
AND YOU FATHER?

1225
01:28:22,332 --> 01:28:23,333
FOR GOD'S SAKE, DAD.

1226
01:28:33,335 --> 01:28:34,335
OKAY.

1227
01:28:35,335 --> 01:28:37,335
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT FOR
A "CIRCLE OF TRUST."

1228
01:28:38,336 --> 01:28:39,336
- A CIRCLE OF TRUST?
- YES.

1229
01:28:42,336 --> 01:28:46,337
COME ALL HERE.
MOM, COME JOIN US.

1230
01:28:50,338 --> 01:28:52,338
I DO NOT DO SUCH THINGS.

1231
01:28:52,338 --> 01:28:54,339
I KNOW, MOM, BUT I
THAT THIS IS NECESSARY.

1232
01:28:55,339 --> 01:28:59,340
FINALLY, I UNDERSTAND THAT SHOULD NOT
I BLAME

1233
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:02,340
FOR MISTAKES MADE, RIGHT?

1234
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,341
YOU, YES, AND YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,

1235
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,342
AND I NEED TO BE AWARE
THAT I MARRIED A MAN ...

1236
01:29:10,342 --> 01:29:12,342
WHICH IS EXACTLY LIKE MY FATHER ...

1237
01:29:13,342 --> 01:29:15,343
A LIAR.

1238
01:29:15,343 --> 01:29:19,344
IF ANY OF YOU
WANTS TO SEE THIS CHILD ...

1239
01:29:19,344 --> 01:29:21,344
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO.

1240
01:29:22,344 --> 01:29:25,345
THERE WILL BE LIES.

1241
01:29:25,345 --> 01:29:27,345
WILL NOT BE STEALING CARS,

1242
01:29:28,345 --> 01:29:29,346
OR WEAPONS HIDDEN IN FURNITURE.

1243
01:29:29,346 --> 01:29:32,346
I WILL NOT TRY ANYMORE BECAUSE
YOU KILL EACH OTHER.

1244
01:29:32,346 --> 01:29:34,347
IN FACT, THERE WILL BE ASSASSINATIONS.

1245
01:29:34,347 --> 01:29:37,347
I SEE THAT I DO NOT WANT TO KILL
EVEN A BITE, RIGHT?

1246
01:29:37,347 --> 01:29:39,348
WE ARE TOGETHER?

1247
01:29:40,348 --> 01:29:41,348
- YES.
- YES?

1248
01:29:41,348 --> 01:29:42,348
GOOD JOB, DEAR.

1249
01:29:44,348 --> 01:29:50,350
ELSE SHOULD KNOW?

1250
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,350
ANYONE?

1251
01:29:56,351 --> 01:29:59,351
ENGLISH IS NOT MY NATIVE LANGUAGE.

1252
01:30:09,353 --> 01:30:12,354
AND ALSO ...

1253
01:30:12,354 --> 01:30:15,355
THE THIRD WEEK
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER

1254
01:30:16,355 --> 01:30:19,355
YOU SAID:
"I LOVE YOU" DURING SLEEP.

1255
01:30:20,356 --> 01:30:26,357
AND I SAID NO, BECAUSE
WANTED ME TO BE THE FIRST TO SAY IT.

1256
01:30:30,357 --> 01:30:33,358
THANKS, HONEY.
MOM?

1257
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:42,360
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE SMALL
AND I WENT FOR A WALK?

1258
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,361
- NO.
- NO? FORGET IT.

1259
01:30:54,362 --> 01:30:58,363
IN ADDITION TO TRACK KILLERS AND WORK
A GOVERNMENT AGENCY ...

1260
01:30:59,363 --> 01:31:01,364
I'D LIKE TO ADMIT ...

1261
01:31:12,366 --> 01:31:15,366
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT HOLE
ON OUR PROPERTY.

1262
01:31:17,367 --> 01:31:18,367
HI, JEN.

1263
01:31:23,368 --> 01:31:24,368
HONEY?

1264
01:31:25,368 --> 01:31:26,368
I DO NOT THINK IT IS A KILLER.

1265
01:31:27,369 --> 01:31:28,369
I KNOW.

1266
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,371
RED WIRE IN BLUE,
AND IS LIKE NEW.

1267
01:31:37,371 --> 01:31:40,371
GREEN ON RED
IS DEATH, IS WHAT I SAY.

1268
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:43,372
NOT SO, I SAID.
YOU COPY ME, JUST.

1269
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:44,372
DO NOT COPY ANYTHING.

1270
01:31:45,372 --> 01:31:46,372
I HAVE NOT COPIED ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

1271
01:31:47,373 --> 01:31:50,373
- REALLY?
- IT IS NOT ENOUGH, EH?

1272
01:31:53,374 --> 01:31:55,374
SAY YES. EH, BUDDY?

1273
01:31:56,374 --> 01:31:58,375
ENJOYING DADDY'S MUSTACHE?

1274
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:02,375
- DO NOT YOU LIKE?
- HOW'S MY BIG BOY?

1275
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:04,376
GREAT, YOUR FATHER THINKS THAT COPY.
WHICH DO NOT.

1276
01:32:04,376 --> 01:32:06,376
PLEASE TELL HIM THAT IT EMULATE.

1277
01:32:07,376 --> 01:32:08,377
SORRY, DEAR,

1278
01:32:08,377 --> 01:32:09,377
ALL GIRLS LOVE THEIR FATHER.

1279
01:32:10,377 --> 01:32:12,377
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

1280
01:32:12,377 --> 01:32:14,378
WE HOPE THAT ALL PARENTS
ARE BEAUTIFUL.

1281
01:32:15,378 --> 01:32:18,379
THAT'S SOMETHING PSYCHOLOGICAL.

1282
01:32:19,379 --> 01:32:22,379
THINK AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IT IS.

1283
01:32:22,379 --> 01:32:25,380
ARE YOU HERE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM
PARENT, AND IT TRAUMATIZED.

1284
01:32:28,381 --> 01:32:30,381
I DO NOT WANT TO SCARE HIM.

1285
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:37,382
- I FEEL IT IS TOO SOON, ISN'T IT?
- IT'S NOT TOO SOON AND

1286
01:32:37,382 --> 01:32:39,383
WE HAVE TIME UNTIL DAWN
WILL BE GONE.

1287
01:32:39,383 --> 01:32:41,383
IT WILL BE GREAT. I HAVE PANTS IN NOVEMBER.

1288
01:32:41,383 --> 01:32:43,383
WELL, SPENCER CAN
TO TRUST US.

1289
01:32:48,384 --> 01:32:51,385
- IN ALL YOU HAVE TO TRUST SOMEONE, OK?

01:32:51,385 --> 01:32:53,385
