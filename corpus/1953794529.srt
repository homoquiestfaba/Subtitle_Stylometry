1
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,900
Dismissed? Me?

2
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,610
You have brought shame upon
Lord Desler's plan!

3
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,150
If you are unable to deal
with the <i>Yamato problem,</i>

4
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,490
then my own position is jeopardized,
as I recommended you for commander.

5
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,530
Don't worry, sir.

6
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,330
I can deal with one or
two Terron ships!

7
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sure you already know this,

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,710
but "failure" is not a word in
the Garmillas dictionary.

9
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,210
Nor in my own.

10
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,460
Y-Yes, sir!

11
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,720
I shall await good news, Goer.

12
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,090
<i>Zar Belk!</i>

13
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,610
Commander, about that ship we lost
contact with several days ago...

14
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,640
Irrelevant.

15
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,150
But that ship has an Imperial Guard
Information Officer on board...

16
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,860
It doesn't matter!
Only the <i>Yamato does.</i>

17
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,030
Find the <i>Yamato, and destroy it!</i>

18
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,070
Here is the <i>Yamato's
predicted trajectory.</i>

19
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,870
They should be within
this 7-korm area...

20
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,370
I will assume command.
Launch the fleet!

21
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,570
Take care, Brother.

22
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,780
Ship now entering warp navigation.

23
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,580
All crew, prepare for warp.

24
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,080
I've gotten used to it now.<i> </i>

25
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,910
Repeat: Ship now entering warp navigation.

26
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,580
We warp, and next thing
you know, we're there.<i> </i>

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,000
All crew, prepare for warp.

28
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,670
Destination coordinates entered.

29
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:48,470
Galactic longitude 274.76,
Galactic latitude -12.73.

30
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,190
Distance is 63.7 parsecs.

31
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,360
Confirmed.
Coordinate axis fixed.

32
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,360
Wave Motion Engine
chamber pressure rising.

33
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,360
Engine pressure has
reached critical point.

34
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,370
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

35
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,830
Warp.

36
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,990
Warp!

37
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,430
What is this?

38
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,640
This isn't how it usually is.

39
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,930
Situation report.

40
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,310
The ship appears to
still be in warp.

41
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,980
I see.

42
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,610
We're currently inhabiting the 1
nanosecond of the ship's warp.

43
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,030
This has never occurred before...

44
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,490
The automatic navigation room?

45
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,410
Mori, go and check the
automatic navigation room.

46
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes, sir.

47
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,830
Message from the XO.

48
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,040
We are currently still in warp.

49
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,460
Listen, it's your own uncertainty
that's causing the blurry vision.

50
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,590
But we are encountering some
complications as we assess the cause.

51
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,010
Not a chance...

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,970
What's happened to me?

53
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Misaki?

54
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,750
Misaki?

55
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,470
Are you okay?

56
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,760
Y-Yes!

57
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,560
Where are we?

58
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,110
I want damage inspections now.

59
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,780
Nothing on radar or scanner.

60
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,400
It seems like we can use
hyperspace transmission.

61
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,070
Probably only in here, though.

62
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,490
Those only resonate within this space.
We can't reach the outside.

63
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,960
Captain, it appears we've fallen
into a dimensional rift.

64
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,710
Where dimensions intersect...

65
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,800
In other words, a dimensional fault?

66
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,460
This is the engine room.

67
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,510
Energy leak of unknown origin
occurring within the Wave Motion Engine.

68
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,010
Shut down the engine.

69
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,310
This area's space-time
characteristics are inverted.

70
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,030
Normally, the Wave Motion Engine
produces infinite energy out of vacuum.

71
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,570
But in this place, it leaks
energy to the outside.

72
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,700
Warning.
Multiple unidentified objects ahead.

73
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,950
What?

74
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,710
It's like a ship graveyard.

75
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,710
They were unable to escape,

76
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,220
and wandered this alternate
dimension for eternity.

77
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,720
A universal Sargasso Sea, huh?

78
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,390
I didn't see anything unusual.

79
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,350
Understood.

80
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,360
Garmillas ship detected at eleven o'clock!
Identified as L-class cruiser.

81
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,650
It's still on line...

82
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,110
The Garmillas ship is on alert.

83
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,660
There's only one ship.

84
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,700
Should we attack?

85
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,200
We hold the firepower advantage, sir.

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,210
If two lions mired in a bog fight
one other, both will sink.

87
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,710
I'm certain they understand that.

88
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,340
Captain, enemy ship is hailing us.

89
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,340
Open a channel.

90
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,470
Alpha 2, stand by in catapult.

91
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,390
Cosmo Zero, on launch standby.

92
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,520
Enemy plane has launched.

93
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,070
Launch the Zero.

94
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,370
Alpha 2, this is the <i>Yamato.</i>

95
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,000
Guide the Garmillas plane to hangar 3.

96
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,710
This whole pretense of sending
an envoy has to be a trap.

97
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,720
But they claimed to know
how to escape this area.

98
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,220
If that's true, why have they not left?

99
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,760
That's something we need to know.

100
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,000
Get hangar 3 pressurized at once.

101
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,090
Pressure rising. Oxygen in hangar
now approaching normal levels.

102
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,770
That's a Garmillan!

103
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,100
What are they like?

104
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,400
They're trying to destroy humanity.

105
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,020
I'm sure they're some
kind of monster.

106
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,770
Look.

107
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,030
No way...

108
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,580
That's impossible!

109
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,450
They're human?
That's a human!

110
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,750
It certainly looks that way, and...

111
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,670
A woman, isn't it?

112
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,130
Her skin is blue.

113
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,060
<We greet you as a
ceasefire ambassador.><i> </i>

114
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,930
<Your Garmillan is
difficult to understand.><i> </i>

115
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,350
It's fine.

116
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,400
I can translate your language.

117
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,980
More importantly, I'd like
to confirm something.

118
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,650
Is this a Terron ship?

119
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:13,980
Terron?

120
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,360
The one called "Yamato"
or something similar?

121
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,750
Lower Storm Leader Ditz has
docked with the <i>Yamato.</i>

122
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,620
If that's the <i>Yamato,</i>

123
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:33,000
it's a lucky break for a second-class
Garmillas ship like yours, Captain.

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,510
Director-General Gimleh will be pleased.

125
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,630
Damned Imperial Guard...

126
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,390
I am Melda Ditz, of the 707th
Galactic Theater Air Corps.

127
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,390
My rank is Lower Storm Leader.

128
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,400
I am the ship's tactical
officer, Susumu Kodai.

129
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,320
Within my empire's territory, there are
others like you, without blue skin.

130
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,240
Are there?

131
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,700
Inferior races from systems we've
absorbed or from colonized planets.

132
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,580
The second-class Garmillans.

133
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,500
Are you sure you're here to negotiate?

134
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,500
And you ask that I trust someone who
brings a gun to meet a negotiator?

135
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,090
Well, the Terrons enjoy war
so much, they attacked

136
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,970
without even a formal declaration.

137
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,100
You were the ones who
started this war!

138
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,930
For generations, my family has
held important military posts.

139
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,350
I swear by my family honor
that I speak the truth.

140
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,810
You lie! You were the ones
who attacked us first!

141
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,820
Kodai?

142
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,240
I'll hear your proposal.

143
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,040
The Wave Motion Gun?

144
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,750
Yes.

145
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,160
I see.
It's theoretically possible.

146
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,460
The Wave Motion Gun
generates a powerful

147
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,540
Dimensional Wave Motion
along its line of fire.

148
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,050
If we aim at the dimensional
fault's phase boundary,

149
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,760
by our calculations, the waves of
interference should clear an exit.

150
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,970
But how did they know about
the Wave Motion Gun?

151
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,270
They must have been paying attention
when we used it at Gliese 581.

152
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,230
But using the Wave Motion Gun would
cost us most of our remaining energy.

153
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,940
It would knock the <i>Yamato off-line!</i>

154
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,860
Don't worry about that.

155
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,570
We promise that our ship will
tow the <i>Yamato to safety.</i>

156
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,240
We need a weapon to create an exit,

157
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,950
and you need someone to get you
out, once the way is open.

158
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,210
If we don't work together,
we cannot escape.

159
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,130
I don't think we can trust them.

160
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,420
It's possible they'll let us fire the Wave
Motion Gun, and then escape alone.

161
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,430
These are the people telling us we're
responsible for this war, after all.

162
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,310
Even as we speak,
we're losing energy.

163
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,980
We must reach a swift conclusion,

164
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,810
or even firing the Wave Motion
Gun will become impossible.

165
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,940
Indeed.
There's no time to hesitate.

166
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,900
Then what do we do?
Is there anything we can do?

167
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,900
There is.

168
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,410
Believe in them.

169
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,250
We've reached our decision.
We'll agree to your plan.

170
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,880
I'm glad.
I thank you.

171
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,760
This is Vars Lang,
Captain of the <i>EX-178.</i>

172
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,730
I am Captain Juzo Okita
of the <i>Yamato.</i>

173
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,770
Captain Lang, we thank
you for your proposal.

174
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,780
Just like you, we have been
stuck here, unable to escape.

175
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,280
We thank you, as well,
for acceding to our plan.

176
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,780
Lower Storm Leader Ditz will remain there,
to serve as a point of contact.

177
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,540
You may take it as a
gesture of our goodwill.

178
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,420
So, a convenient hostage, huh?

179
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,550
But once we return to normal space,
we will be enemies once more.

180
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,050
Understood.

181
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,300
I look forward to exchanging fire with you.

182
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,180
Transmission over.

183
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,390
If we use the Wave Motion Gun, we won't
have energy for our main artillery.

184
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,390
I know.

185
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,690
This is a promise between men.

186
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,520
So Admiral Ditz's daughter
stays with them.

187
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,730
The Terrons must trust us now.

188
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,280
That is a beautiful stone.

189
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,200
While not as splendid as a noble
blue, red is a lovely color.

190
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,210
Red is the color of my home.
And it is my color.

191
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,960
It seems quite important to you.

192
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,460
Just like Kodai's gun.

193
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,300
What do you mean?

194
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,970
Both are mementos our beloved
ones left behind.

195
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,720
Before you killed them all.

196
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,290
Incoming tow beam.

197
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,720
Switch to emergency power.

198
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,930
It's begun.

199
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,300
Prepare to fire the Wave Motion Gun!

200
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,930
Releasing safety lock.

201
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,350
Activating force injector.

202
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,270
Final safety released.

203
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,230
Tachyon particle pressure
rising in chamber.

204
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,780
Garmillas ship is leaving the firing line.

205
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,030
Engage anti-shock and
anti-flare defenses.

206
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,870
Target scope open!

207
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,210
Electronic cross-gauge,
display brightness twenty.

208
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,710
Five seconds to fire.

209
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,840
4... 3... 2... 1...

210
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,090
Fire.

211
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,170
Fire!

212
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,940
Exit has been created.

213
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,860
But now, the <i>Yamato no longer has
the power to move on her own.</i>

214
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,490
Confirmed fissure in dimensional boundary.
It's an exit.

215
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,000
This ship will commence towing
the <i>Yamato from the area.</i>

216
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,500
Garmillas ship has begun to tow us.

217
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,500
Captain, you don't plan to...

218
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,340
You are an outsider here,
Storm Leader.

219
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,550
Hail to our Leader!

220
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,810
Tow beam output
stabilized and normal.

221
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,360
The tow beam has been cut!

222
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,400
The Garmillas ship has sent a hyperspace
transmission to the opening.

223
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,570
It's encrypted, and we can't read it!

224
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,780
Then they do plan to escape
and leave us here!

225
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,460
That's what we get
for believing them.

226
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,920
Impossible!

227
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,790
I knew it.

228
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,420
I knew this was your plan!

229
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,260
What are you doing?

230
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,300
Captain, I...

231
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,140
You're the one who alerted Commander
Goer that we found the <i>Yamato?</i>

232
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,390
I shall report this treason
upon our return.

233
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,310
This is no treason.

234
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,150
You're the traitor here, Captain.
They're our enemy!

235
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,610
You are our enemy.

236
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,370
If you think I'm an enemy,
shoot me. Do not hesitate.

237
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,510
Tow beam has been reconnected.

238
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,390
What's going on?

239
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,510
Stay on alert.
For now, just focus on getting out.

240
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,910
Three minutes until we
reenter normal space.

241
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,250
The exit is becoming unstable.

242
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,420
Maintaining relative
distance to Garmillas ship.

243
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,750
One minute left.

244
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,800
Detecting phase fluctuation.

245
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,920
Accelerating to 12 gat.

246
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,520
You're a pilot, right?

247
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,360
We don't need this thing between us.

248
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,370
Tow beam released.

249
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,330
Ship has returned to regular space.

250
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,540
We did it.

251
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,330
We made it out, right?

252
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,210
Yeah, we're saved!

253
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,340
Good...

254
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,260
All crew to battle stations.

255
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,810
Order Lower Storm Leader Ditz to return.

256
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,680
The <i>Yamato, huh?
A splendid enemy.</i>

257
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,690
Friendlies are Geschtaming in.

258
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,440
Garmillas fleet warping in,
off our port bow.

259
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
So it was a trap!

260
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,400
<i>EX-178...</i>

261
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,280
You are in our line of fire.
You're in the way. Move!

262
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,910
Commander Goer, Admiral Ditz's
daughter is aboard that ship!

263
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,790
Commander...

264
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,750
I don't care. Fire.

265
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,170
We're under friendly fire!
Evade! Evade!

266
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,970
<i>EX-178 has been shot down!</i>

267
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,310
Confirmed destruction of <i>EX-178.</i>

268
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,570
The <i>Yamato shot down the missing
ship we were searching for.</i>

269
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,690
That's what happened, right?

270
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,240
Yes.

271
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
All right!

272
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,820
All ships, open fire on the <i>Yamato!</i>

273
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,460
Exterior armor hit, port side!

274
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,130
Damage control! Hurry!

275
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,050
Let's counterattack.

276
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,920
Turn the ship around.

277
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,800
We're running?

278
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,050
Yes.

279
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,060
Don't let them escape!
Pursue and destroy them!

280
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,320
The enemy fleet is being annihilated.

281
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,990
A huge dimensional quake!

282
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,490
A dimensional fault is
forming at the epicenter.

283
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,330
R-Retreat!
Jump out of here now!

284
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,580
But the flagship cannot retreat before
issuing the order to the other ships.

285
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,330
Do you all want to die?

286
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,090
Enemy fleet has been eradicated.

287
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,850
The exit from the rift tried to
collapse into its original position.

288
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,970
The reaction temporarily expanded
the rift, sucking them in.

289
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,620
Yes, understood.

290
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,210
They said your prior
destination no longer exists.

291
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,010
Episode 10: Graveyard of the Universe

292
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,410
Everyone lives with secret feelings.

293
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,870
It takes courage to reflect on a horrible
past and one's own mistakes.

294
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,750
But look toward to the future.

295
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,330
Now is the time to go forward.

296
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,010
The Yamato advances, on an
unimaginably long journey.

297
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,680
Next time: A World I Once Saw.

298
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,390
There are 323 days left
before humanity is extinct.
