1
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,343
Hey, Kevin.

2
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,876
She loves Kevin Smith, really.

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,925
Kevin Smith, he's brilliant.

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,197
Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Smith.

5
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,562
That was...

6
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,498
That was a really...
That was a sweet reaction.

7
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,699
That almost, almost makes up
for the fact that, you know...

8
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,844
...Charles is gonna marry Camilla.

9
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,976
Almost.

10
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,548
This is a very intimate room.

11
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,844
When I heard "theater," I was like,
"Right on, theater."

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,786
But this is kind of like
Affleck's living room.

13
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,624
Except not as many whores,
I don't think.

14
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,567
We have a few members
of the British press...

15
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,501
...in attendance tonight as well.

16
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,541
So if you see people
writing shit down...

17
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,242
...punch them in the face.

18
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,787
Not really.
Bunch of them went, "Nuts."

19
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,890
The British press I've had, you know,
a decent relationship with.

20
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,555
I haven't really gotten beaten
the shit out of like some people...

21
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17,760
...but last time I was here,
I got into a bit of a row, as they say...

22
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,395
...with some fucking chavs
in the British press.

23
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,805
That's the thing,
they weren't even chavs.

24
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,246
If they were chavs,
I could've gotten along with them...

25
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,214
...but they were just
three fucking cunts.

26
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,015
I don't say that in the charming British,
like, "Oh, you fucking cunt."

27
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,890
I say it in the hard-core American,
like, "You dirty fucking cunt!"

28
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,859
These three broads, they call
themselves the 3am Girls...

29
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,301
...they write for the <i>Mirror</i>, is that it?

30
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,441
So you've heard of them.

31
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,601
We were coming over to do
a <i>Jersey Girl</i> premiere...

32
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,906
...and, of course, Affleck,
at the last minute...

33
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,811
Well, not "of course."
We all expected he was going.

34
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,781
But suddenly came down
with bronchitis...

35
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,950
Hence his new nickname,
"Bronchifer."

36
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,250
- And had to bow out.

37
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,656
So it was me and the little girl,
Raquel Castro, who's in the movie...

38
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,227
...who wound up doing
all the press...

39
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,525
...which was, you know, weird,
because nobody knows her...

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,760
...and what do you ask
an 8-year-old anyway?

41
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,428
Like, "What do you wanna be
when you grow up?"

42
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:31,737
Because the kid's like,
"Fuck you, I'm it. I'm acting."

43
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,742
And then me,
who wasn't really in the movie.

44
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,076
Basically, I was the guy who was just
making excuses for the movie...

45
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,717
...apparently, most of the time.

46
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:43,015
So it was kind of
a lackluster premiere...

47
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:48,126
...and it was heralded
in the 3am Girls' column by...

48
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:52,458
You know, I never forget anything,
so I bring shit.

49
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:57,030
I have an elephant...
Elephantine-like memory.

50
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,330
And ass.

51
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,034
So this is...
This is what they said initially:

52
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,200
"Surprise, surprise,
Ben Affleck has pulled out...

53
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,243
...of the U.K. Premiere
of movie turkey...

54
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:15,311
<i>... Jersey Girl,</i> in which he starred
alongside ex-fiancée, Jennifer Lopez.

55
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,389
The star was due to attend tonight's
screening with director Kevin Smith...

56
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,991
...and young actress Raquel Castro...

57
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,856
...but the 31 -year-old is staying away
because he has, ahem, bronchitis."

58
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:29,458
That "ahem" is just like...
Just dig it in, you know?

59
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,094
So anyway, this is the part that really
stood out to me. It's a quote:

60
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,740
"'It's a shame Ben has pulled out...

61
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:39,367
...because it's obvious this film
needs all the publicity it can get'...

62
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,877
...says an insider."

63
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,008
Now, A, we didn't want publicity
on the movie.

64
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,212
We had too much of it.
Sadly, all bad.

65
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,382
But the thing that really bugged me,
who the fuck is the insider?

66
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,857
Like a British insider?
Like, who was it?

67
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,998
As far as I know, there were no Brits
in the cast or the crew.

68
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,996
And I checked.

69
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,136
Because I said "cunt" an awful lot.

70
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,471
If you say it here, people are like,
"Right on, mate," you know.

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,135
You say it back home, they're like,
"Oh, cunt?"

72
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,110
As if people don't like it.

73
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,374
As if we were in Toronto.

74
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,683
So the quote... Or the insider
went on to say:

75
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,415
"It's unusual for none of the big stars
to put in an appearance...

76
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,219
...and it says a lot about
what they think of the movie."

77
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,158
What? So who is this
fucking random person...

78
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,458
...and why do they have
so much to say, and why...?

79
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,328
Is their finger really
on the pulse and shit?

80
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,196
Like they know so much
about Hollywood.

81
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,032
So we're at the premiere that night,
and this chick, Caroline Hedley...

82
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:44,404
...who is one of the 3am Girls.
Hedley. You know, right there.

83
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,815
Most people are named, you know,
back in the day for what they did.

84
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,385
I'm Smith, presumably somewhere
in my line I had a blacksmith.

85
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,147
Hedley?

86
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,918
That says cocksucker to me.

87
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,752
So...

88
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,531
So I'm meeting
with Caroline Hedley...

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,032
...and of course I fucking
remembered her name...

90
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,731
...and her atrocious-looking
face from the byline.

91
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,636
So I said, "Hey, what's up?
Who's the insider?

92
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,902
Why are you trashing
the movie without giving it a shot?

93
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,670
Why do you have to write like that?

94
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,179
Why does it always have to be
negative? Can't it be positive?

95
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,080
Little girl's here, first time in England,
she's in the movie, and why...?"

96
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,310
And she's like:

97
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,786
"You know what, you're right.
You're turning me around here."

98
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,720
And I was like, "I am?"

99
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,225
And I said, "Right on." So I started
giving her a pretty decent interview.

100
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,489
Then she wrote this:

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,364
"It's obvious to everyone else
that Ben Affleck and J. Lo...

102
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,335
...do not a good movie make.

103
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:51,739
But at least the director of their latest
flick has the grace to admit as much.

104
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,104
The pair dubbed 'Bennifer'
made <i>Jersey Girl</i>...

105
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,149
...before their rather acrimonious split
earlier this year."

106
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,287
Now, this is my quote.
This is the guy saying...

107
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,915
This is the director having
"the grace to admit as much."

108
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,257
"'I think from now on I'm gonna have a
no-couples rule in my movie,' he said."

109
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,693
That's me.

110
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,493
"The negative vibe surrounding them
has definitely taken away...

111
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,295
...some of the business
we could have done."

112
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,169
Is that really me admitting to anything,
or going like, "I'm so fucking sorry.

113
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,367
This is the worst thing that's happened
to humanity since the Holocaust...

114
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,912
...and I don't know what I was thinking.
Please, mea culpa, mea culpa"?

115
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,708
No, not at all.

116
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,282
But this is the really weird thing.

117
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:38,254
She refers to me as "the movie's fat,
bearded, hobbit-look-alike...

118
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,221
...director, Kevin Smith."

119
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,733
Now, I'll take fat and bearded...

120
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,460
...and you can throw in sweaty...

121
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,829
...but hobbit-like?

122
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,633
Like, if I'm a hobbit,
this bitch is an Orc.

123
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,246
But the thing that really
bitched me out the most...

124
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,751
...the thing I really couldn't stand,
was the insider thing...

125
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,354
...because it's just so vague, right?

126
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,084
You could make shit up and be like,
"Insider told me. Total insider."

127
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,559
And I think, in this case, it meant
some dude was fucking inside her.

128
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,058
But two can play at that game...

129
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,035
...because I did some investigating
of my own...

130
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,073
...and insiders tell me...

131
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,178
...vis-à-vis, regarding
the 3am Girls...

132
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,314
...that for a euro...

133
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:40,976
...not a pound, mind you,
a fucking euro...

134
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,587
...you could take any one
of the 3am Girls...

135
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,223
...and brick in her fucking mouth.

136
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,397
Now, mind you,
I don't know if that's true.

137
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,699
It's just what some insiders told me.

138
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,743
Seemed credible.

139
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,209
But these British press people
aren't like that...

140
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,245
...so don't punch them
in the fucking face.

141
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,814
I changed my mind...

142
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,515
...in the middle of that story.

143
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,278
All right, so enough about
fucking me.

144
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,047
Let's go over to you guys...

145
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,283
...and then come back to me.

146
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,825
Who's got the mike first?
This side of the room. You got it?

147
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,223
You got the mike?

148
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,921
Yeah, it's a real hand-raising...

149
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,656
And don't, you know...
Jut right the fuck...

150
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,769
Be American about it.
Like, "Hey, I demand things!

151
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:37,399
It is my right, according to our
Constitution that we piss all over."

152
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,674
First question of the night, sir.

153
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,176
- Set the tone.
- Okay.

154
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,914
First of all, on behalf of everyone here,
thanks a lot for coming to England.

155
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,077
- It's great to have you here.
- Thank you, very grateful to be here.

156
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,916
Thank you.

157
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,953
Thank you.

158
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,563
My question is regarding your
fictional cartoon characters...

159
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,199
...Bluntman and Chronic.
- Yes.

160
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,564
Is there a chance that we might see
a <i>Bluntman and Chronic</i> movie?

161
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,295
And also, if you don't make one...

162
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,702
...is there a particular
Marvel or DC comic character...

163
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,466
...that you'd like to make
a movie about...

164
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,941
...seeing as you've already
starred in <i>Daredevil.</i>

165
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,343
So basically, in England
there's a 46-part question?

166
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,816
It's never as simple as, like,
"Who would you fuck?"

167
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,722
I'm like, "Well..."

168
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,523
Let's take it piece by piece.

169
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,025
I've gotta wait for you to get around
the room, so I've gotta get it all in now.

170
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,061
- Right, right. Cram it all in there.
- Exactly.

171
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,392
I understand. I grew up fat.

172
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,838
So I always understand the feeling
of, like, "This might be my last meal."

173
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,546
- That's why that's...
- You feel my pain, thank you.

174
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,446
You got...? Oh, really?
All right, let me see what your gut.

175
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,578
You don't look that fat.

176
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,246
You're sitting next to a chick?
Do you know him? No?

177
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,392
You will by the end of the night.

178
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,257
I'm gonna romance you two.

179
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,953
For each other.

180
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,689
Oh, you're with him?
Fuck that guy.

181
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,932
Why...? He seems rather fit.
Go for the heavy guy.

182
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,042
Heavy guys are awesome lovers.

183
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,805
Once you get past the grotesque
swinging gut.

184
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,577
Heavy guys try harder...

185
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,377
...because they've got
a lot to make up for.

186
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,282
And they're so fucking
slobberingly grateful...

187
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,049
...for even the tiniest piece
of pussy they're thrown...

188
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:36,092
...you will be eaten out like
you've never been eaten out before.

189
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,322
You'll be eaten out like a man
coming off a desert island...

190
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,728
...digging into a chicken.

191
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,697
I mean, you do have the skills
to back this up, right?

192
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,402
I would hate to go this distance
and have you be like:

193
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,242
"Sorry, I like cock, you know."

194
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,625
So <i>Bluntman and Chronic</i>.

195
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,489
Are we ever gonna make a <i>Bluntman</i>
<i>and Chronic</i> movie? Came close.

196
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,632
And that's what eventually became
<i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i>.

197
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,130
Like, I had initially thought:

198
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,327
"Hey, maybe a whole movie
about <i>Bluntman and Chronic</i>."

199
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,835
I forget who I ran it past.

200
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,632
I think I ran it past Mewes,
and I was like:

201
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,741
"What about us as superheroes
the whole movie?"

202
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,376
He was like,
"You really wanna do that?"

203
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,806
I was like, "Wouldn't it be cool?

204
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,571
We can do, like,
a fake comic-book movie."

205
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,875
He's like, "You're gonna wear tights?"

206
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,050
I was like, "You're right,
maybe just a scene."

207
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,781
Because we don't need that.

208
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,052
So, no, probably no
<i>Bluntman and Chronic</i> feature.

209
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,991
Maybe in the comic-book form.

210
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,825
Maybe I'll get around to doing another
<i>Bluntman and Chronic</i> comic...

211
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,196
...but I can't see myself doing
a whole... A whole feature about it.

212
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,504
And what about the sort of
<i>X- Men</i>- type character angle?

213
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,301
Would you ever think about doing like
a <i>Batman</i>- or <i>Superman</i>- type movie?

214
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,534
Or a <i>Fantastic Four</i>?

215
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,076
- Do a big comic-book movie?
- Yeah.

216
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:04,512
At one point I was attached, and
still am kind of, to <i>The Green Hornet.</i>

217
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,084
I was gonna... I was doing <i>Superman</i>
at one point a long time ago.

218
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,781
But... And we won't talk
about that anymore.

219
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,425
But I was attached
to do <i>Green Hornet...</i>

220
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,153
...up till recently
when I decided to not direct it.

221
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,560
I wrote it. I turned in a first draft,
turned in a second draft...

222
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,031
...but I don't wanna direct it,
because for me...

223
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,261
...I don't have the patience
to do a movie like that.

224
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,632
Like, Harvey Weinstein,
the chairman of Miramax is like:

225
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,240
"You wanna do
the <i>Green Hornet</i> movie?"

226
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,807
And I was like,
"You wanna give me...?

227
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,534
You wanna give me
a comic-book movie?

228
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,440
I love comic books."

229
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,513
He's like, "That's why I asked you."

230
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,517
Said, "I would fucking love to do it."

231
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,846
It was one of those things
that you're so happy to get...

232
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,012
...that you don't think about it
until, you know...

233
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,489
...the smoke is fucking cleared
and it's announced and shit like that...

234
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,992
...that you have no interest
in doing it whatsoever.

235
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,359
Like, I love watching
comic-book movies, but making one?

236
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,760
Fucking boring.

237
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,732
Like, the few times I've actually
had to shoot an action sequence...

238
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,999
...what passed for an action sequence
in some of the flicks we've done...

239
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,007
...it's always so tedious
and fucking slow...

240
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,475
...and it's just, like, you grab
this little piece here...

241
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,511
...then you shoot that fucking
until it's right...

242
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,048
...then you grab this little piece here.
It's a series of cuts.

243
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,948
Whereas, shooting dialogue,
it's just people shooting the shit...

244
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,849
...and they're saying the dialogue
you wrote...

245
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,354
...and I'm kind of in love
with my own shit, so it's just fun.

246
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,358
I'm like, "That's great, let's do it again."
Like, "It wasn't good enough?"

247
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,723
I'm like, "It was great,
I just wanna hear it again."

248
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,127
Action sequences
take like a day to shoot...

249
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,426
...and at the end of the day,
when you cut it together...

250
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,297
...it's like maybe 10 seconds
of screen time.

251
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,835
So that kind of shit's boring to me.

252
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,374
Also, I just don't have it in me to be
a real, like, visual, visceral director.

253
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,670
Like, I'm not the guy...
My version of the <i>Green Hornet...</i>

254
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,642
...would be, like,
the Green Hornet and Kato...

255
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,681
...leaning against the Black Beauty...

256
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,081
...the amazing super car
that can do anything...

257
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:52,088
...and talking about,
you know, pussy.

258
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,054
I mean, it's that simple.

259
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,524
And then Kato would just be like:

260
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,526
"Hey, is that a crime happening
over there?"

261
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,597
Pointing off camera.

262
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,230
And we wouldn't even pan to it.

263
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,235
And Green Hornet would be like,
"Yeah, you're right.

264
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,535
We should do something about it.
Let's roll, Kato."

265
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,837
And then they step out
of the frame...

266
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,345
...and we hold on the car,
and we just hear shit...

267
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,418
...ass kicking,
and then the two come back...

268
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,417
...and they're just like:

269
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,280
"So where was I?

270
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,553
Oh, totally, dude.

271
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:32,425
Anal sex has nothing to do..."
You know, and just go on from there.

272
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,623
And nobody wants
to make that movie.

273
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,598
Like, if I could get away with making
that version of the movie...

274
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,637
...like, the least visually interesting
comic-book movie of all time...

275
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,501
...that's essentially like
one of my chick...

276
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,236
One of my flicks, but just putting
motherfuckers in masks, I'd do it.

277
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,572
But nobody will finance that.

278
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,304
And the thing is,
once you take a budget...

279
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,348
Like, the budget in <i>Green Hornet</i> is
gonna be like 50, 70, 80 million bucks.

280
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,576
Once you take a budget...

281
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,845
...you have to start listening
to what other people say.

282
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,010
It's no longer your flick.

283
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,054
<i>Green Hornet</i> would never be
my movie.

284
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,523
It would always be like this movie
that was kind of noted to death...

285
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,493
...because, wisely, the people
who invest the money in it...

286
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,656
...which would be Miramax or whatever
the new company Miramax becomes...

287
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,894
...or Harvey and Bob
become when they leave Miramax...

288
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,800
...they would wanna make
back their investment.

289
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,339
You don't make your money back
doing my version of the movie.

290
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,941
So essentially they'd be like:

291
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,305
"An action beat has got to happen
every 10 pages."

292
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,946
You've got to follow a formula.

293
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,015
Like, you'd hear a lot of like,
"Do it like <i>Spider-Man.</i>"

294
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,880
Something like... What,
he should shoot fucking webs...

295
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,181
...and act really stiffly?

296
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,921
I was gonna say,
if you were to make it...

297
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,061
...would you put Affleck
in the leading role?

298
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,389
I would totally cast Affleck.

299
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,158
Totally, totally.
I would cast that dude in anything.

300
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,164
Anything whatsoever.
Yeah, <i>Green Hornet.</i>

301
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,269
I'd cast him
as Green Hornet and Kato.

302
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,735
Just have him doing
a really insulting Asian accent.

303
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,537
Do split screen.
Have him talk to himself.

304
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,672
"Kato, do you like pussy?"
"Oh, me love pussy."

305
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,883
Just where critics were like,
"We don't even know what to say.

306
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,325
He's fucking lost his mind.

307
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,432
Yeah, it's funny,
but he lost his mind, you know?"

308
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,396
So, no, you've got to give movies
like that to people like Bryan Singer.

309
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,266
Like, you know, I love...
He did the <i>X- Men</i>, he did <i>X- Men 2</i>.

310
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,034
And I love those movies.
He's doing <i>Superman</i> now.

311
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,767
And I love fucking <i>X- Men 2.</i>

312
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,242
I thought that was an insanely
well-made comic-book movie...

313
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,474
...and balanced a lot of story lines
and shit like that.

314
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,383
And just it works so well
because it's just one big, gay parable.

315
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,853
You know, essentially <i>X- Men</i>
is about being gay...

316
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,959
...and how weird it is to live in a world
surrounded by people who are like:

317
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,424
"You're gay."

318
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,653
So it's totally entertaining.

319
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,425
But meanwhile, you know,
most people don't view it like that.

320
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,795
Most people view it, you know,
the way it's presented...

321
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,336
...where fucking Toad is getting
the shit beat out of him by Cyclops...

322
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,530
...or some such shit.

323
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,870
Or Wolverine is taking on fucking...

324
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:02,980
Colonel Stryker's attacking...
The team attacking the mansion.

325
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,447
But me, I'm sitting there going,
"This is all about being gay."

326
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,983
So you come out of the theater...

327
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,747
...and little kids are like,
"I love Wolverine."

328
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,083
And you're like,
"Come here, come here.

329
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,391
You like Wolverine, dude?

330
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,930
Because if you like Wolverine...

331
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,660
...it's pretty much saying
that you'd put a cock in your mouth.

332
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:33,672
Let me explain shit to you about
what a gay parable this movie is."

333
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,441
Then you drop science on, you know,
a little 10-year-old for 20 minutes...

334
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,450
...and then, by the end, you send him
off into the world ready to eat cock.

335
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,110
Because that's what
the <i>X- Men</i> movie is.

336
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,916
It's just preparing a whole
next generation of kids to be like:

337
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,319
"Hey, it's all right to be gay.

338
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,053
I'm down with it. Wolverine's gay.

339
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,890
That fat guy told me he is."

340
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,293
So I'm kind of hoping Bryan Singer
takes, like, <i>Superman</i>...

341
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,663
...and just turns that
into a gay parable as well.

342
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,964
Just make it all about
how Superman's gay...

343
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,506
...and Lois is like, "Oh, Superman!"
And he's like, "Whatever.

344
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,609
Hey, Jimmy...

345
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,171
...I see you have a camera."

346
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,044
So, I don't... Give it to those cats.

347
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,882
Those cats know
how to make movies like that.

348
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,717
I don't know
how to make movies like that...

349
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,792
...and I'm really not that interested.

350
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,452
Like, as soon as the smoke cleared
from <i>Green Hornet</i>...

351
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,724
...and the fallout of <i>Jersey Girl,</i>
I was just like:

352
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,925
"You know what, fuck,
I'd rather make a small movie."

353
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,229
I'd rather make something cheap.
And that's eventually...

354
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,237
Then we were working on the <i>Clerks X</i>
DVD, the 10th anniversary DVD.

355
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,272
And I was like,
"This is what I'd rather do.

356
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,501
I'd rather go back and see
what these dudes are about."

357
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,044
It's like making <i>The Green Hornet,</i>
just taking off the mask.

358
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,445
Well, my version of <i>The Green Hornet.</i>
But just taking off the mask.

359
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,209
So that's where I switch
and was just like:

360
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,616
"This is what I'd rather...
This is what I'm made to do."

361
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,653
Like, "This is what I like to do,
shit like this."

362
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,654
I love to watch
comic-book movies...

363
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,293
...just don't wanna make them.
Too lazy.

364
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,224
Way too lazy.

365
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,957
Because they just require
too much effort and shit like that.

366
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,092
I'm the guy who, like...
I don't even fuck on top, sir.

367
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,862
Like, I'm a bottom guy...

368
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,439
...because being on top
takes too much energy.

369
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,508
Like, well, how can I direct
a superhero movie...

370
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:16,046
...if I won't even have... Give my wife
the courtesy of climbing aboard.

371
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,444
Where I'm just like, "Go."

372
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,418
Maybe you're looking to be
the antihero in that?

373
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,819
In my relationship with my wife?

374
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,893
Like I'm the villain and shit?

375
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,323
I hadn't thought about it like that.

376
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,725
I guess so.

377
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,891
My idea of being Lex Luthor is like,
"No, you fuck me."

378
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,040
"Don't you want
to take over the world?"

379
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,871
"No. I just don't want to
do the fucking...

380
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,775
...because I get sweaty,
and then the gut swings.

381
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,816
Just, you jump onboard
and tell me when you're done...

382
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,046
...and then I'll wrap up,
and we'll watch some TV."

383
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,353
So no <i>Bluntman and Chronic</i>.

384
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,292
- Thanks a lot.
- Right on.

385
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,261
- Upstairs.
- Hello.

386
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,130
- Hello. Where are you?
- I'm actually up here. You missed me.

387
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,429
- Hello.
- One, I think you're great.

388
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,071
I love all your movies
and your comics.

389
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,265
- Thank you. "Comics."
- Your comics.

390
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,933
So cute. "Comics."

391
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,673
- "Never read one because I'm a girl."
- That is not true!

392
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,214
- You read comics?
- I've got loads.

393
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,817
- You're a comic-reading chick?
- Yes.

394
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,418
- Right on. Hard-core.
- Got over 300.

395
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,612
You must be fucking swamped
in a comic-book store.

396
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,155
I used to work at Forbidden Planet,
so I've got loads of access.

397
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,849
- Did you really? You worked there?
- Yeah.

398
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,426
You know half those dudes
came in...

399
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,223
...they didn't even give a shit
about comics, they were just like:

400
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,832
"She's got boobies."

401
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,765
Big ones, I know.

402
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,997
"She's one of those,
what do you call them?

403
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,732
What do you call them, Gordon?

404
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,136
Ladies. Yes.

405
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,805
She's one of them ladies.

406
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,475
- Hello, love."
- My accent... My accent's not that bad.

407
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,745
It's not that bad?

408
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,321
I've got a comic-book store.
I know what I'm talking about.

409
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,990
Same shit, they just don't have
the cute accent.

410
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,194
I'll come work in your shop, then.

411
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,262
Yeah. Oh, please do.

412
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,092
We'd triple business.

413
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,393
We'd triple foot traffic.

414
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,968
I don't know if anybody would buy
anything unless you were like:

415
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,595
"Who wants to buy this,
I rubbed it on me bum."

416
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,078
Then you'd see motherfuckers
trample one another to get a book...

417
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,186
...that touched a lady's bum.

418
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,248
I hope you got a question.

419
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,727
My question is, though,
you listed <i>Shaun of the Dead...</i>

420
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,887
...as one of your top-10-favorite
films of last year...

421
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,589
I loved <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>.

422
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,394
Would you consider
working with them?

423
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,974
That's so easy, man.
You just come to the fucking...

424
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,474
Do the hometown favorites.

425
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,272
You're like, "I love
<i>Shaun of the Dead</i>," they're like:

426
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,473
"So did we. We're fucking British."

427
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,278
I love <i>The Office</i>.
"He's a smart one, he is."

428
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,445
I don't like <i>The Office.</i>

429
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,784
- You don't like <i>The Office</i>?
- No.

430
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,551
Get out.

431
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,921
You didn't like <i>The Office</i>?

432
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,029
- No.
- <i>Office</i> is brilliant.

433
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,431
- It takes all sorts.
- That job I offered you? Forget it.

434
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,364
It does take all sorts.
So anyway, your question was?

435
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,267
Would you consider
working with them?

436
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,965
Would I consider working with the
bunch that did <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>?

437
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,634
I mean, yeah, if they were like,
"Hey, you wanna be in our movie?

438
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,473
Try to ruin it like you ruin all yours?"

439
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,714
I just can't imagine they would...
They don't need help, man.

440
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,181
Those dudes are doing great.

441
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,582
I never saw <i>Spaced,</i>
is that what it's called?

442
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,745
- Yeah. It's really scary.
- Until I was flying over...

443
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,891
...and watched
an episode on the plane.

444
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,221
Fucking brilliant. It's really, really cool.
So I'm gonna grab like...

445
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,056
I guess the first three seasons
are out here?

446
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,663
- There's only two.
- There's only two?

447
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,926
Yeah, we've been bugging them for the
third season for quite a long time now.

448
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,037
- When you say "we," you mean?
- The British public.

449
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,467
Me and my bloke.

450
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,277
We go to the network,
we're like where's three, eh?

451
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,539
It's like the first question that's always
asked, like, "What's a Nubian?"

452
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,912
"When's season three coming out?"
"Oh, for fuck's sake."

453
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,849
They get that question a lot,
do they?

454
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:20,583
And then they're like, "Wait a second,
you're one of them ladies."

455
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,650
Yeah, so I like that.

456
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,161
I thought that was really funny
and kind of very much in the...

457
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,798
Looked and felt like
<i>Shaun of the Dead</i>.

458
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,092
So now I wanna see all that.

459
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,497
I love those dudes, but I don't think
they'd need any help.

460
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,298
- Seem to have their own crew going.
- Call them.

461
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,198
Next time they work an event,
I'll tell them to call you.

462
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,209
Right on. I think I'm gonna see them.
I think... I'm doing the Empire Awards.

463
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,607
I'm getting an Empire Award.

464
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,648
<i>Empire</i> magazine has an awards
thing they do every year...

465
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,341
...and they're giving me an award.

466
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,353
And I think those dudes are gonna
be there, so I'm gonna hit them up.

467
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,182
Be like, "Can I be in one
of your movies?"

468
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,128
They're like, "I think the fat <i>Clerks</i> guy
wants to be in one of our shows.

469
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,596
No."

470
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,031
- Thank you very much.
- "J. Lo lover."

471
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,539
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

472
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,010
Down here. Yes, sir?

473
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,341
Yeah, a while ago
you did the commentary...

474
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,006
...the director's-cut commentary,
with Richard Kelly.

475
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,947
I did the <i>Donnie Darko</i>
commentary, yes.

476
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,577
Just, basically, I wanted to know,
A, how that came about...

477
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,452
...and, B, there was a kind of
phrase that you said...

478
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,287
...where you kind of said to Richard:

479
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,723
"Now you've done <i>Donnie Darko</i>...

480
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:34,059
...people are wanting you to remake
this film, like, over and over."

481
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,757
And you said that's basically
how you felt with <i>Clerks</i>.

482
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,493
I was just gonna ask,
with hindsight...

483
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,605
...would you actually consider
going back...

484
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,934
...and maybe have done
<i>Jersey Girl</i> earlier...

485
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,441
...or maybe have done something
without Jay and Bob?

486
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,635
Would I...?

487
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,746
Well, I don't think now,
having done <i>Jersey Girl...</i>

488
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,611
...I don't think I'd ever make another
movie without Jay and Silent Bob.

489
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:57,284
Because people are like,
"Are they in it? No? Fuck it.

490
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,150
Fuck it."

491
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,019
But, no, I don't think I'd ever do...

492
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,026
I'd have ever done anything
differently, looking back.

493
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,323
I really kind of like
the way the dominoes fell.

494
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,093
You know, and it sucked that
<i>Jersey Girl</i> didn't do more business...

495
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,897
...but, like, whatever, it doesn't
make me go and wanna go back...

496
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,303
...and to catch the fucking DeLorean,
jump back in time...

497
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,568
...and nearly have sex
with my mother.

498
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,641
For the record, I took my brother
to see <i>Jersey Girl.</i>

499
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,841
He said it was your <i>Annie Hall</i>, which
I think is a really big compliment.

500
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,952
- And he said what?
- He said it was your <i>Annie Hall</i>.

501
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,918
My <i>Annie Hall</i>? I thought he was like,
"It was your only hole."

502
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,559
What is that?
British slang for, like, "good job"?

503
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,094
It's your only hole, mate.

504
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,528
You're only fucking hole...

505
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,895
...you fucking cunt.

506
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,559
<i>Annie Hall</i>?
He called it my <i>Annie Hall</i>?

507
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:46,863
That's very sweet.

508
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,164
I basically mumble...

509
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,865
...because some fat guy told me
about Wolverine was gay, you see.

510
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,151
So you're gay?

511
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,680
- Not really.
- No?

512
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,016
Lot more options when you're gay.

513
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,752
Shit's opened up.
I was at a comic-book show and...

514
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,694
Pun intended.

515
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,357
I was at a comic-book show in
San Francisco about two weeks ago...

516
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,559
...the WonderCom...

517
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,398
...and at the same time,
across the street...

518
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,030
...they were having this big bear
convention about the bear movement.

519
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,771
Like where big dudes who look
like me, and, if I may, like you...

520
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,774
...who are kind of, you know,
hairy and large...

521
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,612
...are referred to in
the gay community as "bears."

522
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:40,156
There apparently are a bunch of dudes
who like dudes who look like us.

523
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,589
Those dudes are called cubs.

524
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,859
Or twinks.

525
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,121
But I like "cubs." That's cute.

526
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,129
So apparently, like, these dudes
make out like...

527
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,133
Like my friend Malcolm Ingram.
Big, big burly dude.

528
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,032
I don't know,
you might've seen him in stuff.

529
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:58,039
He directed <i>Drawing Flies,</i> and he's
been around some of our stuff.

530
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,610
Great guy. Big Canadian idiot.

531
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,780
But one day he was just like...
He called me up...

532
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:08,749
And he never represented himself
as being anything but into chicks.

533
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,185
Then one day he called me up like,
"Fucking weirdest thing happened."

534
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,115
I was like, "What is it?"
He said, "I went out with some dude.

535
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,387
Went out to dinner, and turned out
it was a fucking date."

536
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,162
And I was like, "What?"
And he was just like:

537
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,736
"I just thought I was going out
to dinner with a fucking dude...

538
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,602
...and it was the fucking date load.
All of a sudden, we were on a date.

539
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,539
He told me he was gay
and we were on a date, eh?"

540
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,277
I was like, "Well, did you then accept
the fact that you were on a date or...?"

541
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,281
He was like,
"Well, you know, he was paying."

542
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,849
So that was Malcolm's...

543
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,959
Years later, I realized that was
Malcolm's charming way of saying:

544
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,324
"Hey, I'm gay," without just saying,
"Hey, I'm gay."

545
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:57,434
He acted like he got fucking
hornswoggled into being gay.

546
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,298
"Some dude bought me a pizza,
and all of a sudden I'm gay. Go figure.

547
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,806
Well, I guess that's what I am,
you know."

548
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,105
So Malcolm told me, Malcolm's like:

549
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,770
"Dude, fucking A,
if you liked guys...

550
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,974
...you'd be huge
in the bear community...

551
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,119
...because, you know,
you fucking make movies...

552
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,016
...and you're very sexy to cubs."

553
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,781
And I was like, "What?"

554
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,553
And he was like, "Truly.

555
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,591
You wanna see?
This is a picture of my boyfriend."

556
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,753
And Malcolm whipped out
a picture of his boyfriend...

557
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,761
...and I would fuck this dude.

558
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,527
Like this dude's real, like,
Joe-college cute and shit like that.

559
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,500
Like real good-looking dude.

560
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,572
And the fact that he wants to fuck
Malcolm is like...

561
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,471
I wanna get the kid some therapy.
Some help.

562
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,509
Because I got no problem
with being gay...

563
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,079
...but, like, being gay
and wanting to fuck Malcolm?

564
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,843
You're like, "I'm choosing a life
of nothing but fucking ridicule...

565
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,576
...and people fucking
getting on my ass...

566
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,846
...and I can't fucking do what
straights fucking do...

567
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,183
...without hearing it from
the fucking Church...

568
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,327
...and I'm gonna fuck the fat
bearded guy too," you know?

569
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,155
Like just make it
a little harder on himself.

570
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,124
So Malcolm's like,
"I'm telling you, man...

571
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,597
...if this straight thing don't work
out for you...

572
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,896
...you can totally fucking fuck
a lot of guys."

573
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,164
And I was like, "All right, man,
that's good to know."

574
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,571
Because it would just kind of
open up a world of options.

575
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,804
He's like, "You go to a fucking
bear bar, you'd be Marilyn Monroe."

576
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,678
And that's when
I started thinking about it.

577
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,615
Because I always kind of wanted
to be like Marilyn Monroe.

578
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,379
That didn't pan out for me.

579
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,922
So I'm like, "Essentially these dudes
are like chubby chasers?"

580
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:30,424
He's like, "Yeah, you know,
you don't have to be mean about it."

581
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,555
And I was like, "Well, I married
a chubby chaser, apparently."

582
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,298
He's like, "Well, but, you know,
she don't have a dick."

583
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,770
And that's when we moved
onto another topic.

584
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,703
So, yeah, bears, dude. If you ever
think about... Fucking, you'd make out.

585
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,840
- Apparently.
- Yeah.

586
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,515
You like chicks, though?

587
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,846
Yeah. I haven't found one
in about 10 years though, so...

588
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,509
- Time to try the guys.
- I know.

589
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,288
What was your question, though?

590
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,058
I mean, basically, the whole
<i>Donnie Darko</i> thing was...

591
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,569
...because apparently you're
in <i>Southland Tales</i>?

592
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,263
I'm in Richard's movie
<i>Southland Tales.</i>

593
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,238
He cast me in it.
I don't know if I'm in it yet.

594
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,140
- We haven't shot yet.
- It's just kind of the whole kind of...

595
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,076
...second movie thing.

596
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,807
I mean, if you could
go back in time...

597
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,919
...would you do <i>Mallrats</i> with Miramax
rather than Universal?

598
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,079
Yeah, basically,
if I could go back in time...

599
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:37,627
...and narrowly avoid sleeping
with my mother like Marty McFly...

600
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,556
...I wouldn't have made the movie...

601
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,323
I wouldn't have made <i>Mallrats</i>
at Universal.

602
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,865
I would have waited another year
and then made it at Dimension.

603
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,696
Because at that point
Dimension existed...

604
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,065
...as this kind of genre
offshoot of Miramax...

605
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,867
...but they didn't do comedy,
they only did shit like <i>The Crow.</i>

606
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,478
So a year later they started doing
genre comedy as well.

607
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,443
So we could totally fit right in there.

608
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,641
Which is where we wound up doing
<i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.</i>

609
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:01,876
That was about it.

610
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,613
That would be the only thing
I would kind of think about changing.

611
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:09,317
But I don't really have any regrets
regarding doing <i>Mallrats</i> at Universal.

612
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,657
I mean, I did on opening weekend,
when the movie did, like, no business.

613
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,661
But then the movie
found its audience.

614
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:18,825
It was kind of this wonderful
organic discovery of its audience.

615
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,335
And the audience discovered it,
and suddenly it felt like:

616
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,303
"That's the way it
was supposed to happen."

617
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:27,501
I just wish somebody told me when I
had the fucking shotgun in my mouth.

618
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,079
The day after the movie opened,
you know, where I was just like:

619
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,943
"Oh, it's over."

620
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,010
But I didn't have any bullets.

621
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,789
So I don't think
I would have changed that.

622
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,022
<i>Southland Tales</i> is a movie
Richard Kelly is doing.

623
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,989
For those of you who don't know
Richard Kelly...

624
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,719
...he's the guy
who directed <i>Donnie Darko.</i>

625
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,921
And he was like,
"Hey, you wanna be in this flick?"

626
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,122
And I was like, "Right on."

627
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,699
Because you ask me to be in a movie,
I'm like, "Okay."

628
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,336
Because I'm kind of a whore
for that thing, that kind of shit.

629
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,233
So I said, "What do I do?"

630
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,397
And he was just like,
"You're a guy who...

631
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,043
You're kind of like
a Harry Knowles kind of guy.

632
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,542
You run an internet site.

633
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,704
It's not really a movie,
it's called <i>Southland Tales</i>.

634
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:09,114
You traffic in Southland section
of Los Angeles gossip.

635
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,619
Kind of like a Drudge.
And I was like, "Right on."

636
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,381
So, you know, I read it.
Brilliant script.

637
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,820
I was like, "I'm totally in."

638
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,120
A month ago, he wrote me an e-mail,
he's going:

639
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:21,356
"I'm doing a redraft of your character,
and you're still the guy who you are...

640
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:26,936
...but now you're an Iraqi war vet
and you have no legs."

641
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,577
So I was like, "Like Lieutenant Dan?"

642
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,046
He said, "Kind of like that."

643
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,684
He's going, "Also, I was wondering...

644
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,752
...and I hope you don't take
this too personally...

645
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,822
...but I was wondering if... Do you think
you could lose 50 pounds to do it?"

646
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:50,859
And I was like, "If you chop off
my legs, I will lose 50 pounds."

647
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,589
I said, "Other than that,
unless you've got, you know...

648
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,528
...like gastric bypass
in your budget...

649
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,600
...that's really not gonna happen,
Richard."

650
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,430
He's like, "Right, right.
What about shaving your head?"

651
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,939
And I was like, "No.
That shit's going thin already.

652
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,442
Like, I'm not gonna speed
the plow on that one. Fuck it."

653
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,013
He was like, "All right. But you will
pretend you have no legs?"

654
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,082
I was like, "Yeah, that's easy."

655
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,742
He's like, "Right on." Click.

656
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,285
Because he's just, you know...

657
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,446
He's the most normal guy
you'll sit there and talk to.

658
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,525
He's a dude from Virginia and shit.
Real straight-laced. Good guy.

659
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,682
Talk movies and shit.

660
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,385
But, like, then you see
<i>Donnie Darko</i>...

661
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,794
...and the credits roll, and you're like,
"What the fuck happened?

662
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,265
What happened in that movie?"

663
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,371
And I ask him,
and he still can't fucking explain it.

664
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,372
<i>Southland Tales</i>, you can understand.
It kind of... Like, it makes sense.

665
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,636
But <i>Donnie Darko</i>, still to this day,
is fucking mystifying.

666
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,679
And he... I don't even think
he knows what the fuck it means.

667
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,908
I think he just shot a bunch of shit,
threw it in the air...

668
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,077
...taped it back together
and said, "Here it is."

669
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,581
And people were like, "It's brilliant!"
Especially here. They loved it here.

670
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,386
You guys ate it up
like fucking candy over here.

671
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,119
In the States, people are like:

672
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,127
But here they were like, "<i>Darko</i>.

673
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,798
<i>Darko</i>'s our religion," you know.

674
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,869
Richard is very, very happy with
the reception of the movie here.

675
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,471
I told him I was coming over here...

676
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,937
...and he was like,
"They love my movie there, dude."

677
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,509
I was like, "I'll be sure
to drop your name."

678
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:17,842
He's like, "But don't tell them the role
I want you to play in <i>Southland Tales.</i>"

679
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,416
I said, "I won't."

680
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,277
- We good?
- Thanks very much.

681
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:23,855
Thank you, sir.

682
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:24,947
Thank you, sir.

683
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,715
- Yes?
- In <i>Jersey Girl</i>...

684
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,452
...one of the funniest bits, I found,
was the whole Will Smith story line.

685
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,617
Yes.

686
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,855
I just wondered how you managed
to get him in the film.

687
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,760
Did he had to have
a special contract...

688
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:41,064
...where he was contractually
obligated not to do any of his raps?

689
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,239
That's one very long question...

690
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:57,012
...that just builds up to you
fucking slamming Will Smith.

691
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,621
You don't even
wanna know anything.

692
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,485
You're just like,
"I'm going to ask a question...

693
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,560
...and totally make fun
of Will Smith.

694
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,129
The floor is mine."

695
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,199
I think he's great,
but the raps are a bit dodgy.

696
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,699
They're dodgy, are they?

697
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,496
You don't go for, like,
"Get Jiggy Wit lt?"

698
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,635
It's a shame. I'll let him know.

699
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,107
You are a white girl, though.

700
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,838
I don't know if he really
writes for you.

701
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,312
How did we get him?

702
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,953
It was, basically...
There was a contract involved.

703
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,952
It was a contract
he had to sign that said...

704
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,915
...this would be the lowest-grossing
movie he's ever been in.

705
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,359
Because that movie...
Like, he opens in movies...

706
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,862
...and just fucking... they fucking
explode and shit.

707
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,434
We were probably the lowest-grossing
movie that dude's done in 10 years.

708
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,662
Like, I'm sure he looks at
his track record, he's like:

709
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,830
"Hundred million, 100 million, 100...
What the fuck's that?

710
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,237
It goes off the chart."

711
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,771
"That's <i>Jersey Girl.</i>"

712
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,745
"Fucking fat guy.

713
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,979
Ruined my edge."

714
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,212
How did we do it? We got him
through Ben and Jen, really.

715
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,050
Because I sent him the scene
and shit, and sent him a letter...

716
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,386
Originally, it was written
for Bruce Willis...

717
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,358
...because it was set in '86,
and it was around that period...

718
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,988
...where Bruce Willis thought
he was a singer for a little while.

719
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,658
I don't know if you all remember that?
When he was Bruno...

720
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,669
...and he released an album
as Bruno?

721
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,331
When you pick up the album, you're
like, "That looks like Bruce Willis."

722
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,942
And people would be like:

723
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,169
"It is."

724
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,881
He did. He released two albums
as fucking Bruno and shit.

725
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,677
As if we wouldn't notice
that it was Bruce Willis.

726
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,615
And he'd go on stage,
and people would be like:

727
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:37,879
"You gotta call him Bruno."

728
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,387
I thought that was so funny.

729
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:44,085
So I wrote about that.
Like, basically he ran into...

730
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,059
Basically, the thing
that Ollie got fired for...

731
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,822
...for was for essentially being:

732
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,331
"It's fucking Bruce Willis.
It's not Bruno."

733
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,061
And then later on he met him
years later and shit like that.

734
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,365
And we sent it to Bruce Willis,
and Bruno, just to be safe.

735
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,570
I never heard back from him.

736
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,678
Ben was just like,
"I'll fucking handle this, dude.

737
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,441
We were in the fucking
space-rock movie together.

738
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,141
Running from the space rock
and shit.

739
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:14,185
He'll fucking answer me back
because I was like, 'Harry, I love you."'

740
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,296
And Harry didn't
answer him back and shit.

741
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,591
Harry's like, "I don't love you back,"
you know.

742
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,701
So we never got a response,
so I rewrote it.

743
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,303
I was thinking,
"All right, that leaves us out of '86.

744
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,699
We can update it.

745
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,034
And who is, you know,
if I count back Gertie's age...

746
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,904
...who would be the pop-culture figure
who was, like, big now...

747
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,808
...who wasn't that big then."
And I was like, "Oh, shit, Will Smith."

748
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,278
So I wrote it for Will Smith...

749
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,212
...and then we got it to him,
and he was like:

750
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,114
"You know, I kind of...
It's funny, and I'd kind of like to do it...

751
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,222
...but I think if I play myself
people might think I'm arrogant."

752
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,223
Because he's such a sweet guy,
and so, like, unassuming...

753
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,122
...and one of the best people
in the business.

754
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,160
Real sweetheart of a fucking dude.

755
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,596
So I was like, "You've gotta talk to him,
dude," you know, to Ben.

756
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,736
I was like, "Talk to him. Talk that
famous-person talk to him and shit.

757
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,701
Start talking, like, in the millions...

758
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,238
...and whatever you guys
make and shit.

759
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,433
Bentleys, Hummers,
throw those words around.

760
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,441
You know, and maybe
he'll say yeah."

761
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,377
So Ben talked to him and shit,
and Ben was just like:

762
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,644
"Look, man, like, don't worry.
Like, he's easy to work with and shit.

763
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,082
And you'll come off great.

764
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,223
Trust me, like, you playing yourself,
you come off way better...

765
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,757
...than when I played myself
in this motherfucker's last movie.

766
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,092
So do it."

767
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,856
So basically, those... Ben...
And then also Jen talked to him...

768
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,364
...because they were gonna do
a movie together at one point...

769
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,503
...Will and Jen, this remake
of <i>A Star Is Born</i> or something.

770
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,300
So she knew him through that.
So they both basically asked him...

771
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,306
...and spoke to him
and made him feel at ease.

772
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,001
And he was like,
"All right, I'll do it."

773
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,476
Showed up, greatest fucking...
The sweetest dude in the world.

774
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,478
No entourage and shit. Nice dude.

775
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,549
And it was weird, like,
rehearsing with him...

776
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,709
...because you're, like...
He'd do the lines, I'm like:

777
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,548
"You wouldn't say it like that."

778
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,522
He's like, "Well, the hell I wouldn't.
It's me, ain't it?" You know.

779
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,456
I'm like, "All right, you're right.

780
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,255
Get jiggy with it," you know?

781
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:01,665
What's the big chav community
out here?

782
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,099
What's the big chav community
out here?

783
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,498
Not in this room. Anyone...?

784
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,697
Is anyone really...? What is indicative
or representative of a chav here?

785
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,570
Burberry?

786
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,741
Burberry?
Is that a town, or the scarf?

787
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:20,943
It's a scarf? So if you wear
a Burberry scarf you're a chav?

788
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,779
So my wife is a chav?

789
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,354
Trousers tucked into socks?

790
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,887
A chav will take your wallet?

791
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,360
Good to know.
I know a few chavs.

792
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,591
I brought one with me.

793
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,496
Are you back there, chav?

794
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,337
This shit's always
pretty well planned.

795
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,239
Is there a chav buried
back there anywhere?

796
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,681
Is there one? Ladies and gentlemen,
my chav, Jason Mewes.

797
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,063
What's a chav again?

798
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,370
They love me.

799
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,542
It's amazing.

800
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,244
Why don't you field
some questions, sir?

801
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,318
I'm here. I'm ready.
I have a story to tell, though.

802
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,784
- Yeah?
- About your toilets.

803
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:31,944
Yes.

804
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,852
I think I'm gonna bring
the toilets that you have out here...

805
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,825
...because it's really deep
and there's hardly any water in it.

806
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,556
So I feel bad for the women
who have to clean the shit...

807
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,326
...that, like, slides on the side.

808
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,470
But I was shitting
before I came out here.

809
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,127
I know you was wanting to know that.

810
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:51,001
But I went to give myself
a courtesy flush...

811
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,802
...and the water comes
from the front...

812
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,537
...and it fucking splashed
all over my balls.

813
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,476
I had to tell that story.
I was thinking, I'm...

814
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,848
So I think I'm gonna bring it home,
and I'm gonna put it next to my bidet...

815
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,114
...and I'm gonna be able
to clean my ass and my balls...

816
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,757
...before I get my dick sucked.

817
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,388
Isn't that right?
It's a really good thing.

818
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:15,430
But anyway, I thought
it was pretty amusing.

819
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,797
My balls are clean now, so if anyone
wants to suck my dick?

820
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,206
- Ladies, that's an open invitation.
- No? No takers.

821
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,364
Or fellas.

822
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,636
And it'll never get more
appealing than that.

823
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,213
A dude who's balls
have been washed by toilet water.

824
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,242
It's gross, though, what...

825
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,886
Like, the women
have to clean that shit, you know?

826
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,455
When the water rushed at your balls,
did it mix with the shit water?

827
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,654
No, because it shoots out the front.

828
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,228
It shoots out the front, and it's so deep
that the shit's way down anyway.

829
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:51,027
But it's, like, there's no water
for the shit to, like, go in...

830
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,863
...so it just slides down the side
of the fucking...

831
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,997
It's pretty gross, so... You just have
to deal with it all the time, I guess.

832
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,703
We were on our way here today,
and the...

833
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,175
- Oh, no.
- Yes, sir.

834
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,813
The cutest thing happened.
We get off...

835
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,676
When you travel international
and shit...

836
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,181
...you gotta fill out a card,
the disembark...

837
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:12,015
Embarkation card? Disembarking...?
The fucking card you gotta fill out...

838
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,680
...any time you go someplace,
like a different country.

839
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:18,885
And, you know, they ask for your name
and ask for your passport number...

840
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,624
...and then they ask
for your nationality.

841
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,066
And, you know, we're American,
so I wrote "American."

842
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,705
Then I looked at Jason's card...

843
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,270
...and under nationality
he wrote "Polish."

844
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,119
- I learned something new today.
- You did.

845
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,483
I was like, "What, dude? What?"

846
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,854
He was like, "Well, you know,
I've got some Polish in me."

847
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,318
I was like, "That's not
what they're asking there.

848
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,060
They're asking the country
of your birth, sir."

849
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,257
- I really didn't know.
- No.

850
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:01,768
I think they thought it was a joke, like
I wrote it as a joke, but, no, I didn't.

851
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:06,103
We thought the dude was gonna
be like, "So you're from Poland, then?"

852
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,970
"No."

853
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,713
"Well, that's funny, because it
says here that you're Polish.

854
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,511
Which isn't really a nationality."

855
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,120
The guy just let me through
because I was laughing so hard.

856
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,516
He was like, "Go."

857
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,786
We were in line laughing, and
the dude was like, "What's so funny?"

858
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,555
And I was like,
"My friend's a fucking idiot."

859
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,024
"Welcome to the U.K."

860
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,567
Yes, sir.

861
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:43,110
If you could be half man,
half sausage...

862
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,182
...which way around
would you have it and why?

863
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,621
One more time. If I could be
half man and half sausage...?

864
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,230
Which way around would you have it
and why?

865
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,027
Well, that's the part that...

866
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,296
Right, so you could have, like,
top half man, bottom half sausage.

867
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,133
Okay, so which end would
I rather be the man?

868
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,868
Or top half sausage, bottom half man,
so you can run around. Classic.

869
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,604
Which side...? Which side do I want
to be the sausage side?

870
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,042
Oh, yeah.

871
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,275
That is hands down the best question
I've ever been asked.

872
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,628
I would choose
bottom-half sausage...

873
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:34,992
...because then I would finally have
a massive dick.

874
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,561
- Top half, not real good.
- Genius.

875
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,960
That's brilliant.

876
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,230
Is it a good enough answer?

877
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,567
Not nearly as brilliant
as the question, though.

878
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,547
I've seen you cameo on shows
and movies and stuff.

879
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:55,242
Do you just...? People call you up
that admire your work...

880
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,977
...and ask you to be
on these shows...

881
00:45:57,154 --> 00:46:00,590
...or do you have like an agent?
Do you actively try and get work?

882
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,818
The only... There were two shows
that I actually pursued.

883
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,428
Or I didn't... It wasn't hardly...
It was hardly a pursuit.

884
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,962
It was me going, "Can I do this?"

885
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:09,656
And somebody was like,
"Yeah, I guess."

886
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,097
And one was <i>Law & Order</i>.
I was a huge <i>Law & Order</i> whore.

887
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,363
And I called up my agent, and I was
like, "You never do anything for me."

888
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,769
He was like, "Excellent way
to start a conversation.

889
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,910
I can tell you want something."
I said, "Yes, I do.

890
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,943
I would love to be on <i>Law & Order</i>."

891
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,673
He's going, "What do you wanna play?
Like, the fucking suspect?

892
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,682
You want to be a lawyer? You know,
one of the defense attorneys?"

893
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,685
I said, "No, I just wanna be the guy
that leads them to the guy...

894
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,847
...that leads them to the guy
who leads them to the suspect."

895
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,983
He's like, "Let me see
what I can do."

896
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,651
Called back 10 minutes later,
he's like:

897
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,524
"You go to New York next week.
You're in."

898
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:41,925
I was like:

899
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,590
And I went, and I wound up being
the guy who lead them to a guy...

900
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,895
...who lead them to the guy
who lead them to the suspect.

901
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,004
- You know, it was fucking awesome.
- Yeah, I saw it.

902
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,663
It was kind of...
It was just fun to do.

903
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,433
It was creepy because
I wasn't expecting...

904
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,840
You know, <i>Law & Order</i>, in America,
is on pretty much 24 hours a day.

905
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,002
Yeah, basically.

906
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,809
I mean, it's on like four
different channels. USA, NBC...

907
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,780
- But anyway, I was watching, I'm like...
- TNT.

908
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,783
It's a good show to watch...

909
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,479
...when you basically don't wanna
watch anything...

910
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,591
...because everything's
wrapped up in an hour.

911
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:11,227
- So I'm watching, I'm going, "Yeah..."
- Well, that's like most TV.

912
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,693
- Well, I know, I know.
- Everything wraps up rather quickly.

913
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,729
Well, anyhow...

914
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,663
So I'm watching it, I'm mildly
interested, I go, "Kevin Smith!"

915
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,826
Yeah.

916
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,268
Now I've got heightened interest
in this one.

917
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,069
That was my reaction, as well,
and I knew I was gonna be in it.

918
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,078
What I did was,
I went to the mall, to a TV store...

919
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,772
...and just hung out there...

920
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,885
...turned every TV to fucking
<i>Law & Order</i> and waited.

921
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,217
And then when I popped up,
I was like, "Kevin Smith."

922
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,118
And there was one
65-year-old black guy...

923
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,623
...who was like,
"That's the dude from <i>Leno</i>."

924
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,366
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

925
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,434
Yes?

926
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,402
Hi, what was it like working
with Will Ferrell...

927
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,565
...and have you got any funny stories
about that?

928
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,302
Again?

929
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,978
What was it like working
with Will Ferrell?

930
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,479
Will Ferrell.

931
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,982
I don't know what the fuck you said.

932
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:12,280
Honestly, I thought you were like,
"What was it like with Boba Fett?"

933
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,358
And I was like, "I don't know,
what was it like with Boba Fett?"

934
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,687
"Well, it was quite nice, actually."

935
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,454
What was it like working
with Will Ferrell?

936
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,065
You know, the dude's hysterical
as fucking hell.

937
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,700
Just really, really funny guy.

938
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,463
Constantly, like, making jokes,
but not like, you know... kind of jokes.

939
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,665
Just constantly funny.
Can't help but be funny.

940
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:34,538
Even when he tries to be serious,
the dude's kind of funny.

941
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,839
So no, like, killer fucking stories.

942
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,006
He would come in, shoot,
and then go back...

943
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,117
...because he was working on <i>SNL</i>
at the same time...

944
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,186
...so we didn't get to hang out much.

945
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,049
Do you...? You have any...?

946
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,282
No Will Ferrell stuff?

947
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,790
- Nothing. Great guy.
- No.

948
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,689
- Funny.
- Funny.

949
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,160
Sweet.

950
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,765
- Can I ask Jason a question?
- Yes, please do.

951
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,629
I was wondering
if you'd make my night...

952
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:02,568
...and say "snoochie boochies"
in a seductive way to me.

953
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,142
Oh, no.

954
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,650
I don't know if I can do that.

955
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:18,982
- It's not a sexy word, is it?
- Please?

956
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,023
Now you've got me on the spot.
I don't know if I can do this.

957
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,758
Hold on.
Let me get in the mood.

958
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,832
Snoochie boochies.

959
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,068
I tried.

960
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,506
I never had to do that before.

961
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,409
That might work, huh?
Are you a little wet in the pants?

962
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,913
- Yeah.
- You are?

963
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,678
It might work. I'm gonna try
that tonight when I go out.

964
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,514
I'll be like, "Snooch."

965
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:56,015
Thanks. Thank you.

966
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,164
I'm by myself.

967
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:06,133
Questions? Anywhere?
Fuck this thing. Fuck that.

968
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,294
Fuck these guys.

969
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,732
Up here.

970
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,536
Fuck that. You're too far.

971
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,338
Dude.

972
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,245
Fuck the mike.

973
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,009
It's my show now.

974
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:26,013
It's <i>Evening With Jay Mewes</i>. What?

975
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,749
Do something for us.
Do a monologue.

976
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,893
Do a monologue about...

977
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,620
...eating a clit, licking the clit.

978
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,530
Do it.

979
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,698
- Okay.
- All right.

980
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,430
You say you're the clit commander.

981
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,576
Can I be your commander in chief?
I like the clit too.

982
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,941
I love the clit. I love the clit.
And I take my... Just dip it in.

983
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,106
But you've got get the hood apart.
You've gotta just pry the hood apart.

984
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,809
And then just get your tongue
in just underneath there...

985
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,785
...and then just tease it, tease it
a little bit with your finger tip...

986
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:02,083
...and then slide underneath the clit,
and around...

987
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,658
...and then inside, inside, inside...

988
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,556
...and then back to the clit,
back to the clit.

989
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,391
Don't over do it. Not too hard.
Don't bite. Never bite the clit.

990
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,862
Never suck too hard.

991
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,898
Just lick it, lick it gently.

992
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,502
- How was that?
- Love that.

993
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,297
Was that okay?

994
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,575
- If it was my movie, I'd cast you, sir.
- Thank you.

995
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,737
- If I could cast you, I would.
- Thank you.

996
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,542
Awesome.

997
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,944
I might want you
to eat my ass tonight, sir.

998
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,020
- Sorry, I don't do ass, sir.
- Oh, come on, sir.

999
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,818
Oh, okay. Maybe in your case
I'll make an exception.

1000
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:37,857
That was awesome.

1001
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,961
You know Woody Allen
don't have q and a's like this.

1002
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,827
- Where were we?
- I think she was...

1003
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:49,767
She's got a mike.

1004
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:53,204
- Who was it?
- Hi, I had a refined question.

1005
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,570
But, no, after that.

1006
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:59,806
Me and my friend Neil earlier were
talking about sex euphemisms.

1007
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:03,441
My personal favorite being
"pole in the hole."

1008
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,713
And Neil's... What was yours?

1009
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,516
Would you like a portion?

1010
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,189
- Did you see my man?
- Yeah.

1011
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,594
You know, she's... You know
what she said, right? No?

1012
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,233
- I didn't hear a word.
- Sex euphemisms.

1013
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,665
What's your favorite sex euphemism?
And yours was what?

1014
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,566
- Pole in the hole.
- Pole in the hole.

1015
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,570
- And she said... What's his name?
- Neil.

1016
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,301
And she goes, "Neil has one.
What's yours?"

1017
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,206
And he goes:

1018
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,142
She puts the mike down:

1019
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,544
"Would you like a portion?"

1020
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,416
It was the delivery that was genius.

1021
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,215
Brilliant delivery.
Would you like a portion?

1022
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,518
Right on.
That's my new euphemism.

1023
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,189
What's yours?

1024
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,353
It's that, now.

1025
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,796
Would you like a portion?
What...? What is mine?

1026
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,429
What's my favorite sex euphemism?

1027
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,092
I don't even really have a dirty one...

1028
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,967
...because my wife doesn't let me
get away with really dirty ones.

1029
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,767
You're... What's yours?

1030
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:02,109
How about "give her
a couple of inches"?

1031
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,871
What's that?

1032
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,372
A couple inches?

1033
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,178
I said, "How about give her
a couple of inches?"

1034
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,321
That's a... Really?
Is that what girls say over here?

1035
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,384
- Maybe just me.
- Fuck, we're in the wrong country.

1036
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:20,157
Because you asked for just a couple
inches, that's what you get from me.

1037
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,957
- It's all in.
- It's there.

1038
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,125
- All in.
- That's balls deep right there.

1039
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,533
Can I ask a nicer question?

1040
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,696
Have you ever been watching one
of your own movies...

1041
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,899
...and sat there
and smugly thought to yourself:

1042
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,976
"I'm a fucking comic genius"?

1043
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,038
No.

1044
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:42,046
I sit there, watch my own movies,
and I'm just like:

1045
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,517
"Would you like a portion?"

1046
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,050
No, I don't know, I rarely watch
the movies anymore, you know...

1047
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,456
...because you spend so much
time with them, making them...

1048
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,289
...that you don't really think about it.

1049
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,159
But, you know, you spend one...
That makes no fucking sense.

1050
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,301
You spend so much time
with the fucking movies...

1051
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:01,335
...by the time the movie's done,
you don't want to ever see it again.

1052
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,064
Like, I've seen every one of those
movies so many fucking times.

1053
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,469
Then you let some years go by.

1054
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,769
<i>Clerks</i> I was only able
to appreciate it again recently...

1055
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,502
...because I hadn't watched it
in a while.

1056
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,547
I was like, "It's pretty fucking good.
It's fun. This dude's funny."

1057
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:17,417
But, never, never like,
"I'm a comic genius."

1058
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,680
Because, like, my man who stood up
and did the fucking...

1059
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,346
His clit monologue.

1060
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,789
And suddenly I'm like,
"Well, anybody can do that shit."

1061
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:31,324
He's lying. You're always just like,
"I'm fucking brilliant.

1062
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,966
I'm so...

1063
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,865
Mewes, leave."

1064
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:38,939
- Come on.
- I wanna be alone with myself.

1065
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,306
- He does.
- Would you like a portion?

1066
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,677
What...?

1067
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,789
What is your euphemism for sex?

1068
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,982
"Knock the bottom out,"
you're talking about?

1069
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,354
- Knock the bottom out.
- Knocking the bottom out.

1070
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,462
- Does that work?
- Let me knock the bottom out.

1071
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,599
So hit a girl...
Go ahead, hit her with it.

1072
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,327
Come on, I already did the "snooch."
Come on.

1073
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,300
Yeah, but you would never do
that in real life.

1074
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,371
- Like, "snoochie boochie."
- No, I wouldn't.

1075
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,735
After, how do you...?
How do you approach them?

1076
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:16,072
You just say, "Let me knock the...
Let me knock the fucking bottom out"?

1077
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,441
- How do you say it?
- I don't know.

1078
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,515
I mean, mine's more jokey.
I'm not really...

1079
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,050
- So let's hear the joke.
- I don't know, dude. There's a bunch:

1080
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,346
"Knock the bottom out."
"Let me get up in them guts."

1081
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:26,921
- You do it.
- What?

1082
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,251
- Let me...?
- Let me get up in them guts.

1083
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,127
Dude, your mom's here.
Don't ask me this stuff, sir.

1084
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,523
I hate it.

1085
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,461
Because you really...?
That fucking works on somebody?

1086
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,066
No, it never works.

1087
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,031
This is what works.

1088
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,367
Not really.

1089
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,235
Because that... Yeah, no...

1090
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:47,205
I've got to piss really bad,
so I'm leaving.

1091
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,607
And I'm gonna smoke a cigarette.

1092
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,173
- And I'm gonna go jerk off.
- All right.

1093
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,113
I'm gonna go have
my balls washed, okay?

1094
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,192
What did he say? What is it?
"Let me get up in them guts"?

1095
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,959
Is that what he said?

1096
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,625
Let me get up in them guts.

1097
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:17,398
Would that work on you, if some dude
was like, "Let me get up in them guts"?

1098
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,565
Maybe if it was Jason.
Usually not.

1099
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,870
Like that,
with that harsh, hostile tone?

1100
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,842
Let me get up in them guts.

1101
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:26,106
I think I'd be like, "Oh, shit."

1102
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,510
Try whispering it.

1103
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,345
- What is it?
- Try whispering it.

1104
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,986
Try whispering it?

1105
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,384
I don't even think
the guy can pull that off.

1106
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,183
It'd just sound spooky, wouldn't it?

1107
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,690
There's nothing fun
about that, or playful.

1108
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:41,262
Do you like your vag
being referred to as "guts"?

1109
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,063
Let me get up in them guts.

1110
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,667
- Bloody hell, no.
- You're the bear.

1111
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,237
What was your favorite
euphemism?

1112
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,806
- Pole in the hole?
- Pole in the hole.

1113
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:55,843
- That's how you refer to it?
- Not normally, but it amuses me.

1114
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,343
Not normally, though?

1115
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,846
No, I understand what
pole in the hole means...

1116
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,574
...but thank you
for the demonstration.

1117
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,915
Because that was a little...
"What does she mean?

1118
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,248
Pole in the hole?"

1119
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,786
That's when you're sitting around
with your girlfriends:

1120
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,449
"Oh, we got a little pole in the hole
last night."

1121
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,460
But you don't say it to your man.
You're not like, "Come on..."

1122
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:18,624
If I'm out with my lady friends, it's
"giving away the whole pudding," or...

1123
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,168
- What is it?
- "Giving away the whole pudding."

1124
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:25,301
- I didn't hear that. What?
- Giving away the whole pudding.

1125
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,911
- "Giving away the whole pudding"?
- Yes.

1126
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,646
You British broads are dirty.

1127
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,242
I mean, when you say
"the whole pudding"...

1128
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,318
...you mean H-O-L-E,
or W-H-O-L-E?

1129
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,182
Like "giving away
the whole pudding"...

1130
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,880
...or "giving away the hole pudding"?

1131
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:45,027
Whichever takes your fancy,
go for it.

1132
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,295
Or a bit of fanny fun.

1133
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,865
- What was the other one?
- A bit of fanny fun.

1134
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,525
A bit of funny fur?

1135
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:58,135
Fanny fun.

1136
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:01,766
- Fanny fun?
- Fanny fun.

1137
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,537
Family fun?

1138
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,912
- Fanny fun.
- Spell.

1139
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:11,178
- F-A-N-N-Y.
- Fanny fun. Like ass play?

1140
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,686
No, no.

1141
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,950
- Not ass play?
- "Fanny" here means "fanjita."

1142
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,615
What is it?

1143
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,487
Pussy.

1144
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,223
- "Fanny" covers pussy here as well?
- "Fanny" means "pussy" here.

1145
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,923
- Back home, fanny is your ass.
- Yeah, no.

1146
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,466
- It's not here?
- No.

1147
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:29,662
That would...
I could see why every British...

1148
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,798
British woman I've tried to fuck
has been very confused.

1149
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,037
"Would you like a bit of fanny fun?"

1150
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,680
"Oh, Jesus. Yes."

1151
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,616
"I said, fanny fun."

1152
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,774
"So did I."

1153
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,019
So fanny is the front part,
the girl part.

1154
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,456
- It is indeed.
- It's literally ass back home.

1155
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,755
- Like, "I'll spank you on your fanny."
- Not here.

1156
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,557
Wouldn't wanna get spanked
on your fanny.

1157
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:58,166
- Nasty surprises.
- No.

1158
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,271
How many international incidents
have been caused...

1159
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:05,737
...because of that, you know...?

1160
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,477
Fanny fun. Interesting.

1161
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,307
Two company...
What is it, two countries...?

1162
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,075
Two countries separated by
a common language, is that it?

1163
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,913
- It all comes down to "fanny fun."
- Yes. And the word "fanny."

1164
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,647
I think that was the cause
of the Revolutionary War.

1165
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,950
I think so too.

1166
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,588
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1167
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:29,858
After that conversation what does your
mother think of you and your career?

1168
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,906
- I don't know.
- Can we ask?

1169
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,415
It was weird, when I knew I was
coming over here, I was like:

1170
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,453
"Would you would you wanna come
and see me do q and a in England...

1171
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:55,090
...because it's just like doing
the q and a in America...

1172
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,192
...but everyone sounds smarter."

1173
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,352
Except for that broad, but...

1174
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:05,193
I forgot that the show tends
to be a little bit blue.

1175
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,233
She has spent a lot of show
with her head shaking.

1176
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,770
Have you really been shaking,
up there just editorializing?

1177
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,965
Shaking your head like:

1178
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,871
My mother, in the beginning,
I remember, when the movies...

1179
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,309
When <i>Clerks</i> got picked up and shit,
she was just like:

1180
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,780
"I think it's terrible.
All they do is curse in the movie...

1181
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,579
...and I think that reflects
poorly on me."

1182
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,776
I was like, "Really?"

1183
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,890
She's going, "Everyone's gonna think
that I raised you with a potty mouth."

1184
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,726
And I was like,
"Ma, I'll set them straight."

1185
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,627
So here's me doing it.
And my mother never cursed at me.

1186
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,426
My mother's one
of those people that's like:

1187
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,728
"Oh, H-E, double hockey sticks."

1188
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,805
She don't curse, really.
Until you get her really fucking mad.

1189
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,009
And then she's like,
"Fuck that fanny fun."

1190
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,312
Thank you. Yes?

1191
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:59,851
- Jason, I saw <i>R.S. V.P.</i>
- Let me get up in them guts.

1192
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:06,053
Did it work? No?
All right, whatever.

1193
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,862
Yeah, let me find out.

1194
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,960
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

1195
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,403
- I was gonna say, she's a child.
- Oh, wait.

1196
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,838
"I'm 14.

1197
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,910
What guts are you talking about?

1198
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,637
Mommy."

1199
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,785
I'm out of here. Probation.

1200
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,613
<i>R.S. V.P.</i> what?

1201
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,918
I saw <i>R.S. V.P.</i>
And <i>Tail Lights Fade</i> too.

1202
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:42,656
I was wondering does anyone offer you
any other kind of role other than Jay?

1203
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,397
Here and there.

1204
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,126
Here and there. Not a lot, though.

1205
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:50,761
But I'm doing a movie,
we start shooting next month.

1206
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:55,800
This guy Erik wrote and directed.
It's called <i>Bottom's Up.</i>

1207
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:57,639
It's about fucking.

1208
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,579
No, but Paris Hilton's in it.

1209
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,775
So hopefully we'll be fucking.

1210
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,745
Not really.

1211
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:09,017
But she is in it,
and I think Paul Walker is in it...

1212
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,625
...and some other dude,
I don't know.

1213
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,125
It's like a $3 million budget.

1214
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:15,491
But, no, you know, no one's beating
my door down...

1215
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,997
...for <i>Batman</i> or anything like that.

1216
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:19,992
- So...
- Is that the dream?

1217
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:22,729
Why, are you giving me a job offer?
You got a movie?

1218
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,938
My friend sort of does.

1219
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:27,167
Not movie. Not a movie.

1220
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:32,042
Just this stupid thing.
He's gonna kill me.

1221
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:36,084
Does this movie involve
a video camera and...?

1222
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,310
Yes.

1223
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:42,453
- And Mewes and...?
- No, it's just skateboarding and things.

1224
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,622
It's stupid.

1225
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,961
- There you go, dude.
- I can do some moves, right?

1226
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,155
- Yeah, you can fucking ollie a bus.
- I could kickflip.

1227
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:50,321
- Totally.
- Right?

1228
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,401
- I'll let him know.
- I can't.

1229
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,834
Is that your dream role? Batman?

1230
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:59,497
- No, no.
- "Nobody's offering me <i>Batman</i>."

1231
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:03,372
Like if somebody called right now like,
"Will you play Batman?"

1232
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,241
You're like, "I'm gone, moves."

1233
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,507
- No, I don't...
- You wouldn't do it?

1234
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,480
I couldn't be the Dark Knight, sir.

1235
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,282
I couldn't play that.

1236
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,289
What a sincere answer that was.

1237
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,394
Not like, "That would never happen,"
or, "You know, it would just..."

1238
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,156
"I couldn't be the Dark Knight, sir."

1239
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,161
- Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

1240
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,702
Okay, going up.

1241
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,509
- Yeah.
- Good evening to both of you.

1242
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,541
It's a question...

1243
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,838
So very British.

1244
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:41,015
"Yes, good evening to both of you."

1245
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,614
I do have a question
for both of you.

1246
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:47,119
If you had the job of deciding
the official word of the day...

1247
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,520
...what would today's
word be and why?

1248
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,853
- The official word of the day?
- Official word of the day.

1249
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,461
- Can it be a hyphenate word?
- Sure.

1250
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,324
"Fanny-fun."

1251
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,731
"Polish."

1252
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:05,003
- Thank you.
- Thank you, good night.

1253
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,070
Thanks, that was easy.

1254
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,575
Shit, why aren't they all like that?

1255
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,949
Who's got it over here?
Or you can pass it over to somebody.
