1
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,550
FANTASTIC QUARTET

2
00:00:56,354 --> 00:01:00,412
Typical of Victor Von Doom, build
a statue of his 20m same.

3
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:05,577
It obviously is to let the visitors
with inferiority complex.

4
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,302
fortunately
it is not working.

5
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:13,989
Reed, what we are doing here?
That face only wants to take profit of the science.

6
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,142
It is our first coming here.
Further more, Victor is not so badly this way.

7
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,507
He just is a little exaggerated.

8
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:30,857
My researches suggest...

9
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,518
which the exhibition to the a cosmic cloud
highly energizada

10
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,175
summed to the solar winds...

11
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:38,388
it could have contributed
with the evolution of life in the planet.

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,109
In six weeks,
another cloud...

13
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,514
with the same fundamental composition
it will pass by our orbit.

14
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:48,570
A study, done in the space...

15
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:52,588
it can increase considerably
our knowledge on the human gene.

16
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:56,805
Cure countless diseases, prolong life,
give to the children a chance of living

17
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:00,929
- for more time, more healthy, strong.
- Turn off! Please

18
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:04,268
- I think I did not explain my proposal.
- I think it explained, yes.

19
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:09,711
the same dreamer, examining the stars
with the wishes of the world to your side.

20
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,246
But dreams do not pay
the accounts, pay?

21
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,620
it reminds
When we were at school

22
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,438
we talked about
we work close.

23
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:20,639
It was that that I was in
Prestes to explain.

24
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:25,447
The tempest is mortal,
but the capsules of your station

25
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:28,548
they were done for protect
any occupant in her.

26
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,600
Then it does not want
just my money...

27
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:36,421
it wants my toys as well.

28
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,062
Tell me, if the NASA does not trust 
you, why Would I ought to?

29
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,654
This is my work,
always stay one go pass ahead

30
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:50,949
Know what the others do not know.

31
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,227
- I do not stand anymore that.
- Stand, just are business.

32
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,210
He all right Ben,
they just are business.

33
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:02,784
I think you know my
geneticist director, Susan Storm.

34
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,963
One more thing than he has.

35
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:10,357
- Hi, Susie.
- Hi.

36
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,009
- It is good see you. How is Debbie?
- Great.

37
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:20,523
- How they have state?
- I never was better.

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,008
- That is not going to be a problem, it?
- In no way

39
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:31,432
What a good, then arrived on time of
hear the great Reed Richards...

40
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:34,260
ask for me help.

41
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:39,363
I know that you did lots of colleagues
in MIT as a good scientist,

42
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:42,266
Then me sorry for
savor the moment.

43
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,164
Support this research and I will give you
a good percentage of...

44
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,776
75%, more equivalent applications.

45
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:51,248
And regarding his son?

46
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:54,470
Ben, which is?

47
00:03:54,471 --> 00:04:01,273
25% of a billion is the enough
for pay the accounts for a time.

48
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,131
Closed?

49
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:16,711
Well, to our future.

50
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:20,037
Close.

51
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:24,090
Funny in the that the
things became,  did not it?

52
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:26,169
Hilário.

53
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:32,643
Reed, and regarding NASA?
It could have been him who fingered us

54
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:36,325
Ben, think of people's quantity
which will be able to help if that come out right

55
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,743
We get what we wanted,
it is already the enough.

56
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:42,591
Some days in the space. It will be great.
what of worse can happen?

57
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,867
If Reed is right, this viagenzinha
it is going to triple the value of our actions.

58
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:52,753
- And if he is not right?
- He always all right

59
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:56,655
fortunately he neither
always knows what it has in hands.

60
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:08,191
Reed, you should know that
the solar winds accelerated...

61
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,207
In fact, my programs
they are already according

62
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:14,782
It is, clear that are. But it is a little
different when it is up there

63
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:18,272
- I am sure that you will show me
- When we leave?

64
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:23,775
I will make an appointment the new release,
then link me by morning.

65
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:27,408
- I think I remind me of the number.
- He changed.

66
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,593
regarding crew, waited
which Ben could pilot the nave.

67
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:40,486
Already we have a pilot in the company, but
you can stay on the bench of hitchhike.

68
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,938
it reminds of my
brother Johnny?

69
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,392
I ca not do,  ca not.

70
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:04,947
SRPs external, anti systems
heating of the motors.

71
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,476
- It is alike the nave that...
- No!

72
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:09,004
I ca not receive
orders of the underwear model there.

73
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:11,285
- Which is, Ben.
- That madman was expelled of the NASA

74
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:15,115
for hiding two models
inside the flight simulator.

75
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:20,525
- He have experience.
- He hit a wall. In a simulation.

76
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:24,634
When it was that I asked you for do one
did not thing that you want to do?

77
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:27,741
- 5 times!
- I thought they went 4.

78
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:30,024
With this is five.

79
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,786
- Already I feel yearnings, Of.
- Captain in the enclosure.

80
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:54,455
digital camera, 254 dollars,
memory, 59 dollars,

81
00:06:54,641 --> 00:07:00,025
The look of my former-teacher
when discovering that I am your boss.

82
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,376
It does not have price.

83
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:07,957
- Thanks, what a lovely.
- I can direct the nave.

84
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,384
I can even work with the
Blond ambition mrs....

85
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,312
or then we will be flying for
the lake of the swans with these clothes.

86
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,834
Who was that it invented that?

87
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:16,973
Victor invented.

88
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:19,544
She acts as a second skin,

89
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:20,545
attending the needs
individual of your body.

90
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:26,323
That means that the hot things
they remain hot, and the cold, cold.

91
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,891
Uau, fantastic!

92
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,320
A clothes done of molecule
unstable auto-regular.

93
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:36,552
I walked searching one
formula for that.

94
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:40,555
It has things that never change.

95
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,866
- Here are yours, Ben.
- Thanks, dear.

96
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,094
Reed.

97
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,814
Forecast for
cosmic event: 9 hours.

98
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:25,011
If you are good, of the next
time the daddy can let direct.

99
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:28,409
Continue talking and
will not there be again

100
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:34,341
a little different from vision that
in the Planetarium,  is not?

101
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,164
It is... it is yes.

102
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,483
We can monitor the results
of the tempest and to observe the test from here.

103
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:52,090
- Is it safe?
- The shield of the nave will protect us

104
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:55,005
- I had taken.
- Which the problem Ben?

105
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:57,450
Do stay paranoiac with the old age?

106
00:08:57,685 --> 00:09:01,405
We will start loading the samples.
Go to get dressed, Ben.

107
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:05,458
It seems that you continue
doing the weighed work.

108
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:09,386
Perhaps you should have stayed in the
laboratory. field work never...

109
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,088
- it fell well in you.
- He talks and I walk. It withdrew?

110
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:18,492
Then go to take a walk, expensive.
Actually, if they allow me

111
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:22,175
I will have to catch Susan
lent by a moment.

112
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,304
Clear.

113
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:33,583
Please tell me that Reed is not in
trying to resume the things with my sister.

114
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,797
Of course not
just business.

115
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:39,246
It is, well... but his eyes
they do not seem to tell that,  it?

116
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:42,341
It was very hard
the separation of the two.

117
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,351
Perhaps she as well
do not have overcome.

118
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:47,502
Well, therapist, that is profound.
We will think

119
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,464
We have Victor, with more money
what a God, stallion of the year.

120
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:56,715
And we have Reed, the intelligent more
donkey of the world, without money some.

121
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:01,320
- It is an intransigent dispute.
- Do not disturb your cabecinha with that.

122
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:04,653
You go there for outside now, boy.

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,904
Surprised by I have accepted
Reed's Proposal?

124
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:32,509
I understand that business
they are business.

125
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:35,511
Well, when we look
your pro future,

126
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:38,516
it does not do we badly find us
close to the past.

127
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:45,579
Susan, always dreamt in have
a woman for who would give the world.

128
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:49,177
In my case is not
only a metaphor.

129
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:57,218
<I>Opening shield of the capsule.</i>

130
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:28,655
That it ca not be right.

131
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:34,033
<cosmic event I foreseen for
9 minutes and 47 seconds.</i>

132
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:37,504
That is not possible. That would ought to
happen inside hours.

133
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,452
we are already close 2 years ago

134
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,515
They were two great years Victor.
The company evolved so much this time.

135
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,724
Yes, clear. The company.

136
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,912
But I realized that,

137
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,643
the whole success of the world does not mean
nothing without anybody for divide that.

138
00:11:57,402 --> 00:12:01,593
For all my life,
I was afraid of give great steps.

139
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:05,344
- Now it is time to give the biggest of them.
- Victor...

140
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:09,553
Think in this as a promotion.

141
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:16,781
I hope by the words that can
for ever, change our lives.

142
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,067
The cloud is accelerating.

143
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:21,694
We have minutes until the impact.
Not hours.

144
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,398
Victor, this tempest is mortal.
We need to cancel.

145
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,529
It recompose, Reed.

146
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,296
We did not come here for
lose the head in the first challenge.

147
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:30,402
- Just closes the shield.
- Ben still is outside

148
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:32,050
Then put him for inside.

149
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:35,139
We came for do a work,
then we are going to do. Fast.

150
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:40,147
Victor, the forecast for
impact in less than six minutes.

151
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,993
- Ben, you need to enter now.
- Which is happening?

152
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:50,371
- Did not yet harvest the flowers,  ca not...
- Ben, look for trás.

153
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:03,050
- People,  I do not am going to get.
- You need to jump, it is the unique way.

154
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,000
- Which is doing?
- Closing the shield.

155
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:12,315
- It ca not deixá him outside
- It wants to bet?

156
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:15,827
You ca not ajudá him
more than I can.

157
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:17,517
I at least will try.

158
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,842
We go Ben, it is almost there.

159
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,622
OK, Johnny, be ready
for close the portal.

160
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:36,960
Chord, Ben.

161
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,037
Ei, hour to awaking, garotão.
As if it feels?

162
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:42,022
Where am?

163
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:45,790
Back to the the Land. Of quarantine's
in Victor's Infirmary.

164
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:50,193
- Reed? Does sweat?
- They feel well. All of them feel well

165
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:54,023
what exists of wrong with me?

166
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:58,036
Ben, I swear that they did
all that it could be done.

167
00:14:58,037 --> 00:14:59,892
The best plastic surgeons
of the world were here.

168
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,100
You had the best.

169
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:04,601
- Give me that mirror.
- I do not know we are a good idea.

170
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:07,594
- They told that the shock...
- Give me this porra of mirror.

171
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,412
Ben, be strong.

172
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:18,988
Unfortunately, the doctors could not
do anything for improve your guy.

173
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:29,662
Ei, it was good.
A grandpa's appearance.

174
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:52,184
- How is she in?
- Stable and with strong vital signals.

175
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:55,522
It does not show any radiation,
what a good...

176
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:59,375
- You remake that form..
- Every 4 hours, yes...

177
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,136
We know what we are doing.

178
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,802
One more day under observation
and she already can go.

179
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:13,777
She is allergic the orchids.
Put the sunflowers close to her

180
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:15,896
They are their minions.

181
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:34,610
Well, Victor...

182
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,861
It would like parabenizá him.

183
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,714
It was the fastest fall
since the depression.

184
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:41,500
We do not get neither to donate
actions of your company.

185
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:43,010
You know that I can
give to return for top.

186
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:45,635
You will have to give, Victor.
Or we will jump outside.

187
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:49,902
You have a week.

188
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:52,120
You like this,
is not it Ed?

189
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:57,903
A week.

190
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,396
Ei, where it thinks we are it going?

191
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,757
I do not know if you noticed...

192
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:16,594
The second largest hill of the Alps
it is behind that window.

193
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:20,625
It is, I realized. But there are rules here.
It ca not leave until

194
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:23,783
until finish the exams. I know.
But I never gave me well with the rules.

195
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:27,881
Warn me when he leave the results.
It wants to help me with that zipper?

196
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,022
- That is not a ski field.
- Not yet

197
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:33,646
But fortunately
he brought my equipament.

198
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:35,885
You would get impressed with...

199
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:40,372
- You are a row.
- Row is my name of the half.

200
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,446
- You are hot.
- Thanks, you as well.

201
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,373
- And I do not am afraid of cry.
- No, it is serious. You are boiling.

202
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,714
I never felt better in the life.
God, as you smell well. Hear...

203
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:51,076
- When do you go out from work?
- To the 4:00.

204
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:55,064
Following, find me to the 4:01
in the top of the mountain.

205
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:59,490
And will give you a refreshed.
That is your. That is my.

206
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:11,381
- For how long was I unconscious?
- Hi, three days.

207
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:14,464
Expensive, it was worried about
you. As if it feels?

208
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:18,583
Solid.
This was almost, hein?

209
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,641
- what was that?
- I do not know.

210
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:24,734
I really do not know.

211
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,237
I have been looking pros results
several times.

212
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,523
And it was not for have happened that.

213
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,196
I do not know. Perhaps I oughted to
have cancelled the mission earlier

214
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:36,884
Reed, it was an aberration of nature.
I did not have how to be foreseen. It forgets.

215
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:44,610
When if raisin for something like that, we
it feels thankful by the woman of our life.

216
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:47,599
- You and Debbie are perfect.
- I do not be talking about Debbie.

217
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:55,066
what? Which is?
She has a thing good with Victor.

218
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,404
He is intelligent, powerful,
welloff.

219
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,539
Perhaps you shoulded leave with him.

220
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:04,324
She finished staying with right the guy.
The things took the best way.

221
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,378
Have I to do everything alone?

222
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:34,797
I think should stay to the right.
The left can give work.

223
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:37,323
We are going to jump from here.

224
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:40,317
We go by the left. Who arrive
finally paid the room service.

225
00:19:47,706 --> 00:19:50,078
It is my future wife.

226
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:19,987
- It is losing.
- It arrives in jest

227
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:23,005
Eye that.

228
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:33,362
- You are catching fire
- Thanks, you are very good as well.

229
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:36,015
No, you are catching fire
Eye.

230
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:12,612
It wants to come in?

231
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,273
I only will stay for a drink, because
I have to find me with Victor.

232
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:25,858
Well,  I do not want to do
Victor wait.

233
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:28,114
Reed, what it does here?

234
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:30,216
I thought...

235
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:35,139
Great, perhaps you
it can join

236
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:39,136
- How are the actions?
- Falling, we wait a twenty.

237
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:42,297
what is already good considering
the recent disaster.

238
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:47,209
Call Emmy Shells,
and I arrange me the coating of the newspaper.

239
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,038
Which do with this scar?

240
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:54,419
Make photograph me
just by the left side.

241
00:21:54,522 --> 00:22:00,253
Actually, the scar is a good.
The public thought it lets you more human

242
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:03,645
And is that good?

243
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:09,596
You know, perhaps you ought to
rest a little

244
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,278
Later, I have business
to treat now.

245
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:17,603
- An agreement that needs to be closed.
- Mr., always asked me

246
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:21,067
why it sweat? It can have
any woman of the world.

247
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:24,641
Because of this
Because I can have all the others.

248
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:38,317
It feels well

249
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:42,677
spoiled shrimp.
I find better to go to lay down a little

250
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:44,946
Excuse me

251
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:08,302
- it feels better?
- Yes, thank you.

252
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,037
What a good.

253
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,676
It is... good.

254
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:19,037
You always had appearance
with the words.

255
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:26,887
Well, I have to go because...

256
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:31,976
- I have to find me with Victor.
- I am very happy for you and Victor.

257
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,291
it really is happy for
me and Victor?

258
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:38,623
I can tell that you are seizing
the best of our relationship.

259
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,053
- Which?
- Passion.

260
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:47,129
- By the science.
- You are an imbecile, Reed.

261
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,693
You never understood.

262
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,285
- And it never will understand.
- Which was that I said?

263
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:54,115
Unless explain you
using Quantum Physics.

264
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,365
It only wanted you to know

265
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:59,775
Already it was two years and all that says me is
which is happy for me and another expensive?

266
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:04,805
Victor can be several things, but by the
less is not afraid of fight whereby wants.

267
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:08,688
It is good being wished sometimes, Reed.

268
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:13,073
Be looked and hurt.

269
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:17,569
Look for me.

270
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:21,940
- I ca not.
- How it thus ca not?

271
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:24,431
- Look for me!
- Sweat, look their pras hands.

272
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:50,026
Ei, people. You will not go
believe in that happened to with me.

273
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:50,954
what

274
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,737
I can explain that.

275
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:25,273
It only could have been the cloud.
She changed our DNA.

276
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:29,447
It is not right yet. We need many
evidences for prove this theory.

277
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,842
People, look.

278
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:43,707
Now, imagine that...

279
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:46,364
but in everywhere

280
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:50,455
It was in everywhere
what

281
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:54,601
The cloud changed our DNA.

282
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:57,358
Legal!

283
00:25:57,466 --> 00:26:00,387
- People, and I thought it felt well
- We need to find Ben.

284
00:26:07,656 --> 00:26:10,208
Stop with that Johnny.
Johnny?

285
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,618
- Ben, is Reed.
- Stop with that.

286
00:26:12,722 --> 00:26:14,068
- All right
- All right

287
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:15,526
- Yes
- God.

288
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,258
- Which exists of wrong with you?
- what

289
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,908
Sweat, do you know the code?

290
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:29,786
- Ben, open the door.
- Do you feel well

291
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,492
Someone has the key
for these doors?

292
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,173
Anybody?

293
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:22,846
What a disgusting!

294
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:31,663
- Ben?
- Look, look.

295
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:36,650
what is that?

296
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:42,074
what is happening?
what there was here?

297
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:45,676
- Victor, do you feel well
- I feel well, just some dizzinesses.

298
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:50,568
Ben did that. He had a kind of
reaction to the exhibition to the cosmic cloud.

299
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:53,299
We all have different symptoms.

300
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:56,686
- Symptoms?
- Victor, I would ought to...

301
00:27:59,973 --> 00:28:02,913
Someone has some idea
where was grandão for?

302
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:08,453
He is going for marries.

303
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,700
It only can be joke.

304
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,347
normal buttons.
Hello, switchboard operator?

305
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:06,662
- Hello.
- Of, am I.

306
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:10,319
Ben, do you feel well
You different sane.

307
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:12,608
Eye, I need that you
leave on the door.

308
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:15,696
On the door?
You tá coming for marries, dear?

309
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:22,645
- I am.
- I have a surprise for you.

310
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:27,972
It is... I also have one
little surprised for you.

311
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,928
Ben?

312
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:38,202
- Where are you?
- I am here.

313
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:41,994
Wait a little
for arrive closer, OK?

314
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:45,910
It is going to be a true shock.

315
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:47,709
Dear, which is happening?

316
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:56,694
Of, it reminds when we told close
for ever,  it does not matter what happens?

317
00:29:57,165 --> 00:29:58,611
I remind.

318
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,898
Dear, you are frightening me

319
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:21,849
- Good God
- Debb, am I. Still am I.

320
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:24,712
- It was the accident, let me explain.
- No,  do not me touch

321
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,160
Of.

322
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:33,933
Ei, call the police.

323
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,637
It was that expensive there.

324
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:10,008
Oh yes, Ben, some days in the space.
It will be great.

325
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:12,637
what of worse can happen?

326
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,485
Ei, rapazinho.

327
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,715
You are not afraid of me, are you?

328
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,500
I perform.

329
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:32,304
It was worth.

330
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:47,183
Ei!

331
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,242
If you think it has problems,
look for me, colleague.

332
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:57,560
It ca not be so badly, right?
I do not think it would get.

333
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:01,338
OK, colleague.
It goes calmly

334
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:05,626
Do not go for there. I said, stop.
It comes for here.

335
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:11,763
That, it comes for here.

376
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:59,231
<I>...when firemen's truck
it turned part of the tragedy...</i>

377
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:04,487
<I>The accident in himself is not the history. One of the
four we stretched to a distance...</i>

378
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:05,941
It is as soon as they are calling you.

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,505
- Who of you is the leader?
- Am I.

388
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:36,142

00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:40,134
Right, son, is with you.

390
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:51,666
For a research in one
space station...

391
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,683
we were exposed to an energy of
gravity zero not yet identified

392
00:40:56,684 --> 00:40:58,464
- what existed with you?
- How much can you stretch?

393
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:00,181
Is it true that you can fly?

394
00:41:00,202 --> 00:41:02,143
I am working on this.
Actually it is very difficult.

395
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:05,264
Actually,  we do not know too much
more than you at this time

396
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:11,615
Mr., Larry King cancelled the interview.
It seems to there be a better history.

397
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:18,421
<I>... that really happened.
It is necessary to see believing, people..</i>

398
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:22,694
<I> The Fantastic Quartet...
- We are going to the laboratory for</i>

399
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:25,817
<I>diagnose our symptoms.
- Symptoms? It is some kind of disease.</i>

400
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:28,623
No, no...
it is not a disease.

401
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:32,403
If have special powers is a disease,
then we are infected.

402
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,080
But have a Thing of that
it does not seem so fantastic.

403
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:37,570
Ben Grimm is a hero
genuinely American, please

404
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:39,828
what he means is that all
team needs a mascot.

405
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:45,500
A new day arrived.
The day of the Fantastic Quartet.

406
00:41:49,293 --> 00:41:53,582
Eye, we were pro space for meet
a way to understand the DNA.

407
00:41:53,885 --> 00:41:57,728
Cure diseases, save lives.
And now that is in our DNA.

408
00:41:58,504 --> 00:42:03,448
Our diseases, our lives
they are at stake. Thanks to everybody.

409
00:42:05,411 --> 00:42:07,511
It is as soon as it intends to give
the return for top?

410
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:11,855
These aberrations in the coating?
Your company in the "Bankrupt"?

411
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:13,892
It was thinking of
use the publicity...

412
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:16,819
The committee came to terms
The bank already lost too much money.

413
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,595
- Wait a little
- It is too much afternoon, Victor.

414
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:23,922
It imagines of how much money
Did I invest in this company?

415
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:25,814
Victor, stop.

416
00:42:25,815 --> 00:42:29,045
That is not a negotiation,
it is a notification.

417
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:32,162
We are jumping outside.

418
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:17,307

424
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:12,447
Or we are going up very fast

425
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,923
WEIGHT EXCEEDED LIMIT

426
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:22,881

The what? It thinks we will not get
turn off our as well?

431
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:43,255
That would economize time.

432
00:44:43,535 --> 00:44:46,123
You do not want really to leave for
there catching fire pro rest of life, whether?

433
00:44:46,134 --> 00:44:47,358
Is that a question?

434
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:50,841
- It sees we grow
- Am I the unique that finds that legal?

435
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:55,171
Should stay here until discover
what it caused our changes...

436
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,646
and to discover as revertê them.

437
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,260

YOUTH WINS PRIZE
INTERNATIONAL OF SCIENCE.

445
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,131
It was so worried about you.

446
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:04,363
Victor, sorry for do not have linked.

447
00:46:06,165 --> 00:46:08,571
It does not need if apologize.

448
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:11,777
I arranged for that her things be
carried to one of my apartments.

449
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:16,343
- You are going to stay very there.
- Thank you, it is much your generosity

450
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:18,849

Until manage to care for of this everything.

452

00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:28,270
Victor, what it does here?

454
00:46:29,822 --> 00:46:32,413
I am starting to me

00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:35,549
How much it knows than
did happen with you?

456
00:46:36,197 --> 00:46:39,419
Not much. We need to do exams

457
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:42,764
Warn me there is something that it can
do. We are in this close now.

458
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:53,996
Victor, wait.

459
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:59,240
I only wanted to apologize me for
things do not have left as planned.

460
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:02,531
How planned?
It was a catastrophe.

461
00:47:02,622 --> 00:47:04,807
You ruined the lives
out of the 4 people.

462
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,744
With all respect,
the blame belongs to both of us

463
00:47:06,745 --> 00:47:07,589
I said you for cancel the mission.

464
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:12,594
Do cancel? I placed my company,
my name, billions dollars in risk.

465
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,371
I will not let you do me
seem an imbecile.

466
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,969
- Victor, we manage to understand...
- I do not want to understand.

467
00:47:18,163 --> 00:47:22,611
That is one of their science projects.
I only want to arrange that everything. Fast.

468
00:47:23,712 --> 00:47:26,748
Any problem?

469
00:47:30,908 --> 00:47:35,174
No, problem some, Ben.

470
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,568
Just pays to tells of light and
start to find a cure.

471
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:18,116
- He heats starting from your interior.
- Their vital signals are normal.

472
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:21,418
We are going to identify the source of the mutation.

473
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:23,508
We need to isolate
your DNA recombinado...

474
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:25,980
so that we can identify
the position of genomas.

475
00:48:25,981 --> 00:48:28,445
We need to take samples of you
for see what it changed.

476
00:48:28,478 --> 00:48:30,867
Oh, why he did not tell soon?

477
00:48:31,735 --> 00:48:34,371
Their internal organs are
completely solid.

478
00:48:37,098 --> 00:48:40,761
Is it very badly?
You know, I used to smoke

479
00:48:42,737 --> 00:48:44,948
It is not well invisibility.

480
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:48,770
You should be able to reflect the light
through objects and even of people.

481
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:51,434
If you could control your
alone emotional state.

482
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:52,978
what he said?

483
00:48:53,038 --> 00:48:56,403
If you had emotional control
you could meet the trigger.

484
00:48:56,487 --> 00:48:59,220
You if you remind of your state
exact emotional in the base?

485
00:48:59,828 --> 00:49:04,872
Hatred, rage, frustration.

486
00:49:04,873 --> 00:49:07,431
Right, it has how you duplicate
one of these feeling

487
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:09,479
so that Can I memorize a?

488
00:49:10,535 --> 00:49:12,682
I am sure that
I can get something

489
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:15,516
- It feels anything
- No.

490
00:49:23,557 --> 00:49:26,811
It is hotter than I
it imagined. Johnny, cool a little

491
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:30,432
- I only manage to heat.
- Johnny, you have to cool.

492
00:49:39,631 --> 00:49:41,928
Johnny, cool that right now

493
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:51,834
Wow, you stayed
fascinated with my style.

494
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:54,449
Johnny, you was to 4000 Kelvin.

495
00:49:54,717 --> 00:49:56,622
You was arriving near
of Very young.

496
00:49:56,758 --> 00:49:58,995
- Legal
- No,  it is not legal.

497
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:02,419
- It is the temperature of the sun.
- And you not only could have died,

498
00:50:02,598 --> 00:50:06,128
but it could for all the atmosphere
aflame, finishing with all life.

499
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:09,614
I understood, Very young... bad.

500
00:50:16,842 --> 00:50:18,246
How is going?

501
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:27,894
- Me sorry, is it all right
- I am.

502
00:50:28,117 --> 00:50:29,484
- Is it sure
- I have.

503
00:50:32,173 --> 00:50:35,634
You could be thinking 
it was being hostile with you.

504
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,951
why Would I think that?

505
00:50:43,196 --> 00:50:45,333
It means
you finished with me, right?

506
00:50:46,142 --> 00:50:47,214
Is it playing?

507
00:50:47,215 --> 00:50:50,298
No, only thought you reminded
of you leaving by my door.

508
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,096
I was ready pro nearby step.
You not. So, I went away

509
00:50:54,197 --> 00:50:57,790
- I think I was more complicated than that.
- I only wanted lived close.

510
00:50:57,899 --> 00:50:59,891
what exists of so complicated in this?

511
00:51:00,403 --> 00:51:02,318
There were many variable
to consider.

512
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,915
There was not, no.
There was I and you.

513
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:09,576
No variable, no mathematical.
It was the simplest thing in the world.

514
00:51:09,577 --> 00:51:11,812
But as usual, Reed,
you went very rational.

515
00:51:11,892 --> 00:51:13,856
- No,  was not.
- Then what happened?

516
00:51:17,185 --> 00:51:19,788
It felt something
when Did I go away

517
00:51:21,763 --> 00:51:23,930
Do you feel anything now?

518
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,299
Ei, people.

519
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,903
I think we have
a serious problem.

520
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:52,440
Their fabrics, their organs.
Your whole body is changing.

521
00:51:52,591 --> 00:51:54,640
All the systems yet
they are worked, somehow

522
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:58,655
- Am in the that I transforming me
- I do not know to the right.

523
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:01,801
A kind of metallic organism.

524
00:52:01,969 --> 00:52:03,994
stronger than titanium or
carbon fiber.

525
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,318
harder than diamond.

526
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,005
Like the shield that protected us

527
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,034
How long

528
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:19,223
In this speed, the mutation
it will complete in two or three weeks.

529
00:52:19,224 --> 00:52:22,270
- How thus completed?
- I would like to know.

530
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:25,229
I ca not pretend know the
which is happening here.

531
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:29,362
- I will have to alert CCD.
- what

532
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:31,593
- Diseases Control center.
- I know what it is.

533
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:35,126
If that is contagious, we can have
a great problem in our hands.

534
00:52:35,127 --> 00:52:38,167
I am talking about an epidemic.

535
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,903
Look for me.

536
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:45,648
I am the guy of a company
out of the 1 billion dollars.

537
00:52:47,273 --> 00:52:49,939
We need to keep that
secretly

538
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,905
Victor, this disease is progressive and
degenerative. I need notify A...

539
00:52:55,513 --> 00:52:58,000
It is terrible news.

540
00:53:04,984 --> 00:53:07,792
I think I will search
a second opinion.

541
00:53:35,996 --> 00:53:39,226
Our uniform were exposed the
tempest, as we.

542
00:53:39,227 --> 00:53:40,873
Then they can if
transform like us

543
00:53:40,899 --> 00:53:44,757
They can get invisible,
stretch and to support the fire.

544
00:53:44,978 --> 00:53:47,345
You seem with a band
of years 80.

545
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:51,491
Ben, that material stretches. I
it would manage to do him serve in you.

546
00:53:51,622 --> 00:53:54,193
No, thanks.
I do not want to use that neither dead.

547
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,717
I like these fantasies, but
there is one missing thing, a symbol.

548
00:53:57,837 --> 00:54:00,829
- They are not fantasies.
- It ca not use their powers in public.

549
00:54:00,981 --> 00:54:03,443
- You are worse that the NASA.
- Johnny.

550
00:54:04,316 --> 00:54:06,942
Now alone fault
an utilities belt.

551
00:54:13,598 --> 00:54:16,138
SWEAT STORM:
WHO DOES SHE FOR WORK NOW?

552
00:54:18,762 --> 00:54:24,919
- Ei, it is the Invisible Woman.
- Eye, my children love you.

553
00:54:32,528 --> 00:54:34,699
I do not believe that I
I am doing that again

554
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:51,982
Right, we will eat fast.
I have to go to lots of places today.

555
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:55,079
Oh, wait.
I do not go to place some.

556
00:54:55,133 --> 00:54:57,206
Johnny, it is very important that
stay inside home

557
00:54:57,399 --> 00:54:58,863
until lose
the fame.

558
00:54:58,864 --> 00:55:02,086
I know, but last time that you said
that, my head hurt a week.

559
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:04,150
Johnny, it is very dangerous
for you leave in public.

560
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:05,779
You have me told that there are years.

561
00:55:05,914 --> 00:55:08,137
what I worries is that
our powers are unknown.

562
00:55:08,197 --> 00:55:09,852
I know, I know.

563
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,677
I am so close to fly
people, I can feel.

564
00:55:13,221 --> 00:55:15,087
- You ca not fly.
- Not yet

565
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:16,870
Johnny, it can erase the napkin?

566
00:55:19,973 --> 00:55:22,710
And there, Reed?
It arranged a cure for people?

567
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:25,900
I am going to build a machine
to recreate the tempest.

568
00:55:26,244 --> 00:55:30,182
The cosmic lightnings are going to travel
of this generator for this chamber.

569
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:31,362
Without explosions?

570
00:55:31,554 --> 00:55:35,721
- If I get invert the signal...
- You can come back to the normal.

571
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:40,770
Right, but which are the risks?

572
00:55:40,978 --> 00:55:44,507
A calculation simple mistake can increase
the symptoms exponentially

573
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,685
or until kill

574
00:55:46,822 --> 00:55:49,762
Die...
is that right bad?

575
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,238
I think should let
as it is, people.

576
00:55:52,405 --> 00:55:54,697
How long delay for
do build that?

577
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,628
- I do not know, it is difficult to tell.
- How long, Reed?

578
00:55:56,779 --> 00:55:58,486
- I do not know.
- Do not you know?

579
00:55:59,263 --> 00:56:01,958
- You do not want that worsens.
- Worse than that?

580
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:04,666
People, we will stay prisoners
here for a time,

581
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:06,656
then we are going to try to cohabit
in a good.

582
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:23,928
Does not it know how to beat

583
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:25,220
Apology!

584
00:56:59,957 --> 00:57:02,031
Johnny!!!

585
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:08,198
The CURSE FOR VON DOOM

586
00:57:45,972 --> 00:57:47,513
Interesting.

587
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,361
Oh, only can be joke.

588
00:58:13,643 --> 00:58:15,028
Hey?

589
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:21,998
Victor?

590
00:58:24,764 --> 00:58:26,632
Which existed with these lights, hein?

591
00:58:27,432 --> 00:58:30,552
About we jump outside.
Without resentments, right?

592
00:58:30,952 --> 00:58:32,286
It was not anything personal.

593
00:58:36,718 --> 00:58:41,470
You know, you always can if
change for La Viere.

594
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:45,403
Resume again
Perhaps there be your place.

595
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,506
The old world.

596
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:04,058
Nothing personal, Ed.

597
00:59:04,927 --> 00:59:07,595
But I do not go to place some.

598
00:59:35,832 --> 00:59:38,170
I have to leave from here.

599
00:59:56,752 --> 00:59:58,744
Ei, good-looking!
We will see what you have.

600
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:03,712
It is going to be your carango
against mine.

601
01:00:07,242 --> 01:00:08,738
Let's go

602
01:00:26,146 --> 01:00:30,577
All right, give a round of applause
for a guest very special.

603
01:00:31,496 --> 01:00:35,607
Mr. Johnny Storm,
of the Fantastic Quartet.

604
01:00:41,547 --> 01:00:43,627
Look praquilo.

605
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:50,829
That was fantastic.

606
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:56,106
But Johnny, that is old trick.
Show us something new.

607
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,806
Something new... already I know.

608
01:01:12,265 --> 01:01:14,259
Is he flying?

609
01:01:28,486 --> 01:01:32,959
I feel well. I feel well

610
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:37,522
He feels well... it is all right

611
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:41,069
Johnny Storm ladies and gentlemen.

612
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:45,060
Congratulations Johnny.
You are good.

613
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:57,968
- He did not do that.
- Oh, he did yes.

614
01:01:58,344 --> 01:02:01,719
- That boy never listens.
- what did he do with the uniform?

615
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:08,051
- I have to ask you about the clothes.
- An Armani's Mixture with Astronaut.

616
01:02:08,275 --> 01:02:11,691
- Which ones your names of super heroes?
- They call me human Torch.

617
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:13,998
The girls call me torch.

618
01:02:14,114 --> 01:02:16,814
- And regarding the team's rest?
- This is the Invisible Girl.

619
01:02:16,815 --> 01:02:18,044
Girl?

620
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,717
And regarding the leader, Reed Richards?
The call fantastic Mr..

621
01:02:20,852 --> 01:02:23,031
- It could be worse.
- It could.

622
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,901
It is true that he can stretch
any part of your body?

623
01:02:28,628 --> 01:02:30,965
Well I always thought 
he did not link for these things.

624
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:34,647
what that's it? As you
flame this Thing?

625
01:02:35,609 --> 01:02:39,834
That's it, The Thing. it thinks that
it is ugly, should have seen before.

626
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:42,003
OK, now I am going to kill him.

627
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,536
there he is

628
01:02:54,561 --> 01:02:55,621
TORCH

01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:00,454

630
01:03:00,606 --> 01:03:02,974
No,  we ca not talk about this
after. what is doing?

631
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,382
Cadê of mine car?

632
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:19,455
- It thinks that is funny, spit?

633
01:03:19,656 --> 01:03:21,279

634
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:24,842
what do you find? Then now
are you the guy of the Fantastic Quartet?

635
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:26,565
A guy who is Prestes the
be broken.

636
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:30,360
It is not permanent wave Johnny, need to be
cautious until are normal again

637
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:33,183
I do not want to be normal.
I will not become a monster.

638
01:03:38,663 --> 01:03:40,254
Johnny, apologize

639
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,885
You played...

640
01:03:48,028 --> 01:03:50,818
Then it is that Little bell.
You want to fly?

641
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:52,651
Then flies.

642
01:03:58,294 --> 01:04:01,930
personal calm.
Ben,  do not do that.

643
01:04:01,946 --> 01:04:04,907
We will see like you
it stays with a tan.

644
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:06,678
We will see
it can come Queimadinho.

645
01:04:06,713 --> 01:04:07,798
Both of you, stop with that.

646
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:13,802
- Stop to hold me, he who started.
- I has not interest

647
01:04:13,837 --> 01:04:15,566
Damn, Johnny.

648
01:04:17,141 --> 01:04:18,454
Ben, wait.

649
01:04:19,392 --> 01:04:19,838
what

650
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,426
You need if control.
Think before to acting

651
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:29,442
This is your problem. You always
it thinks but it never acts.

652
01:04:29,477 --> 01:04:33,343
And we win these powers for one
reason? And if that is a called Superior?

653
01:04:33,523 --> 01:04:35,543
One called kind arranges
girls and money?

654
01:04:35,578 --> 01:04:37,110
 is there superior to that?

655
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:41,192
It wants to know, Reed?
That is what we are. Accept.

656
01:04:42,115 --> 01:04:45,399
Or better yet,
seize.

657
01:04:48,711 --> 01:04:50,750
Wait Ben, calm.

658
01:04:51,614 --> 01:04:56,226
He did not mean that. You the
it knows. He always was head-hot.

659
01:04:56,378 --> 01:04:58,938
Is not him. They are

660
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:03,526
- I ca not live this way.
- Give a little more of time's for Reed.

661
01:05:03,561 --> 01:05:07,233
You know works; analyzing
each step, before take a way.

662
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:09,755
- It is easy for you be patient.
- It is not not.

663
01:05:09,885 --> 01:05:13,734
I thought never more would have to
wait for Reed. But I...

664
01:05:16,395 --> 01:05:18,072
We are in this close, Ben.

665
01:05:18,506 --> 01:05:23,171
Close? Susie, look for me.
You does not imagine

666
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:29,578
than I would give for
be invisible.

667
01:05:43,464 --> 01:05:45,996
Thanks gentlemen.

668
01:05:46,928 --> 01:05:48,820
I only am going to catch
some things...

669
01:05:50,692 --> 01:05:52,855
for some friends.

670
01:05:52,856 --> 01:05:55,481
TERM-GUIDED MISSILE

671
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:10,816
I perform.

672
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:41,126
That is not funny.

673
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:47,372
That here is Ben Grimm, the first
inhabitant of the Brooklin to the go pro space.

674
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:49,902
- Show some respect.
- Give me the one of always and I already leave.

675
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:52,032
All right

676
01:06:53,474 --> 01:06:56,236
- double dose.
- Do of her a dose triple.

677
01:06:57,331 --> 01:07:00,818
- Put in my account.
- It can let, dear.

678
01:07:00,853 --> 01:07:03,787
- Thanks.
- Without problems.

679
01:07:08,872 --> 01:07:13,594
- It is all right, Ben.
- there is God, he hates me

680
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,935
She... does not link much pro hatred.

681
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:20,255
You do not see me or
he would not tell something like that

682
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,225
Then let me see him.
Can I?

683
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,320
It is all right

684
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,693
So sad.

685
01:07:58,059 --> 01:08:03,810
You know, be different neither
always is a bad thing.

686
01:08:04,047 --> 01:08:08,585
Believe in me. This not
it is one these times.

687
01:08:10,147 --> 01:08:12,624
Not if you not
it wants be.

688
01:08:13,347 --> 01:08:16,647
- All right, go away
- I accompany you

689
01:08:16,682 --> 01:08:18,338
Until more Benny.

690
01:08:24,987 --> 01:08:27,626
Anyway, my name is Alicia.

691
01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:32,913
Thank you, Ernie.

692
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:50,402
Reed. all that I wanted,
and all that he wanted. He took from me.

693
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,144
Now, it is time to take back

694
01:09:01,844 --> 01:09:06,910
But first I have to
liberate me of your... bodyguard.

695
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,967
Is that place busy?

696
01:09:23,307 --> 01:09:25,282
what is doing here?

697
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:30,870
- It was worried about you.
- Worried with me?

698
01:09:30,905 --> 01:09:35,028
- What a sweet.
- It lets I pay you some food.

699
01:09:36,412 --> 01:09:39,364
It seems that you
it needs a company.

700
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:45,894
Reed...

701
01:09:52,035 --> 01:09:55,367
- It was resting my eyes.
- I am sell.

702
01:09:55,953 --> 01:10:00,802
- The inversion plan is very promising.
- It is not promising the enough.

703
01:10:00,837 --> 01:10:02,651
Which are the nearby tests?

704
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,425
My plants finished.

705
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:09,685
Then I am thinking of, perhaps...

706
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:16,178
- Use to me as cavy.
- No, it is very early.

707
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:18,236
- Reed...
- I should come back to work.

708
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,585
- You need a rest.
- Now not, please

709
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:23,080
Come... let's go.

710
01:10:24,704 --> 01:10:26,531
- it reminds of this place?
- Clear.

711
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,500
It was the place where
I called you for leave.

712
01:10:29,676 --> 01:10:32,308
I think it was I who
I called you for leave.

713
01:10:32,453 --> 01:10:34,017
Right.

714
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:38,039
Well, you was a lot
intimidante.

715
01:10:38,074 --> 01:10:40,918
The girl always waits
which the man stays in the command.

716
01:10:40,953 --> 01:10:44,406
- Neither everybody is as..
- How who? Victor?

717
01:10:44,883 --> 01:10:51,861
You know,  there is not I and Victor.
Never existed.

718
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:56,804
Well, I think I was what
I thought you always wanted.

719
01:10:58,018 --> 01:11:00,870
The kind man fortão.

720
01:11:04,853 --> 01:11:09,549
I wanted, Reed.
But it wanted you to be that man.

721
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:11,258
And why he never said me

722
01:11:11,903 --> 01:11:15,765
I think that would finish
with the purpose of everything.

723
01:11:16,225 --> 01:11:20,955
But I am telling now.
Then stay in the command.

724
01:11:29,472 --> 01:11:31,082
That is not just.

725
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,480
Sorry.

726
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:48,960
You know,  it is not easy. The change
pros other was not so great this way.

727
01:11:49,211 --> 01:11:52,050
At least they still can leave
in public, but you...

728
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:54,553
it is wanting to liven up me
it is doing a great work.

729
01:11:54,588 --> 01:11:58,109
- It understood Scarface?
- I only tell that I know what it is to lose something

730
01:11:58,144 --> 01:12:01,333
it loves... see him slide and
never more come back.

731
01:12:01,368 --> 01:12:05,694
Eye, Reed is going to arrange me, right?

732
01:12:07,001 --> 01:12:09,088
I hope that you are right.

733
01:12:09,123 --> 01:12:14,168
He is a brilliant man, and he oughts to
be working the maximum that can.

734
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,317
You are his the best friend.

735
01:12:16,318 --> 01:12:19,272
Then which reason he
could it have for kill time?

736
01:12:22,064 --> 01:12:26,631
It means, besides passing
more time with Sweats her

737
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:32,311
- Wow, neither it imagined
- It is true.

738
01:12:35,646 --> 01:12:40,127
It is, I have that effect in people.

739
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:46,757
- Ben...
- Then you if you remind of my name.

740
01:12:47,497 --> 01:12:53,611
You also reminds than it swore
do, until the last air of their lungs?

741
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:55,540
We are working the
maximum that can.

742
01:12:55,575 --> 01:12:58,574
It is, gives for notice.

743
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:02,254
- Victor was right.
- Victor?

744
01:13:02,289 --> 01:13:05,661
Ben,  I do not know if that goes
repair or worsen the things.

745
01:13:05,696 --> 01:13:08,067
I need that it is patient
for a little more of time's.

746
01:13:08,102 --> 01:13:10,154
- Reed, look for me.
- I am looking.

747
01:13:10,189 --> 01:13:12,718
It is because of this that I ca not be mistaken.
I have to do everything right and

748
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,463
yet is not everything right yet.
We need testá her.

749
01:13:14,498 --> 01:13:17,953
I passed my whole life you
protecting, and for that?

750
01:13:17,988 --> 01:13:19,931
For that you can play
with your girlfriend

751
01:13:19,932 --> 01:13:22,046
while I am
the aberration of week?

752
01:13:22,924 --> 01:13:26,617
- Ben, stop with that.
- Stay outside this, Susie.

753
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:27,910
Stop or I am going to stop.

754
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:30,981
Let's go, rubber man.

755
01:13:32,038 --> 01:13:33,125
Ben, wait.

756
01:14:05,448 --> 01:14:09,691
fortunately you are flexible
the enough for care for of himself

757
01:14:16,412 --> 01:14:19,801
Because I will not care for
more of you.

758
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,650
Both of you are alone.

759
01:14:35,244 --> 01:14:39,210
Ei, it looks what marketeiro
gave me... eye! Listen!

760
01:14:39,245 --> 01:14:44,428
"Tá in the hour of the stick!"
It is going to catch,  it?

761
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:47,888
Is not it great?

762
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:52,532
Oh, it was a prototype.

763
01:14:56,548 --> 01:15:01,089
Ben! Johnny, did you see Ben?

764
01:15:01,124 --> 01:15:02,734
I saw, the sun ray had just left

765
01:15:02,735 --> 01:15:05,549
Sweat, me sorry, but I do not stand
more that aberrations show.

766
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,115
I need come back pro real world.

767
01:15:07,122 --> 01:15:08,619
You tá calling that
of real world?

768
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:10,130
Sweat, stop.
You are not the mom.

769
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:11,924
Stop talking with me as
if I was a child.

770
01:15:11,959 --> 01:15:14,046
Who knows, when you
stop acting as one.

771
01:15:14,081 --> 01:15:17,429
You at least it listens
Who do you think is it?

772
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,560
why always are filling me
they are enviously, all right

773
01:15:20,595 --> 01:15:21,852
But it did not wait that of you.

774
01:15:21,874 --> 01:15:24,493
You really find that that
does people worry with you?

775
01:15:24,528 --> 01:15:26,685
You are only a phrase, Johnny.

776
01:15:27,531 --> 01:15:29,532
We will try a thing new,
you lives your life and I mine

777
01:15:31,533 --> 01:15:33,015
It seems good?

778
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:38,398
And only for that you know,
they love me

779
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,851
OH God, Reed.

780
01:17:05,607 --> 01:17:09,793
- Good God, Reed, what did you do?
- I can do work.

781
01:17:10,004 --> 01:17:10,664
No.

782
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:14,352
I need more energy for
control the tempest.

783
01:17:14,584 --> 01:17:16,961
- can most?
- You need a doctor.

784
01:17:20,881 --> 01:17:24,744
Leonard, bring Grimm pro building.

785
01:17:28,412 --> 01:17:31,023
Ben, come in.

786
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,919
what that's it
Cadê Reed?

787
01:17:34,954 --> 01:17:38,027
Where do you find?
With Sweats.

788
01:17:38,157 --> 01:17:43,050
- I continued from here, Leonard.
- Yes Mr..

789
01:17:47,576 --> 01:17:51,160
- what it wants?
- Help you.

790
01:17:51,484 --> 01:17:55,024
The machine is ready.

791
01:17:55,059 --> 01:17:58,428
- Reed said that it was not.
- He also said that the tempest

792
01:17:58,429 --> 01:18:01,299
cosmic would not affect us
but we know that it affected,  it?

793
01:18:01,571 --> 01:18:05,461
He did not get energy enough
for machine reach the critical mass.

794
01:18:05,496 --> 01:18:09,540
One more mistake pro Fantastic Mr..

795
01:18:09,575 --> 01:18:12,441
- Do you get?
- Yes.

796
01:18:15,311 --> 01:18:21,932
Tell me
you want to be Ben again?

797
01:20:05,412 --> 01:20:07,120
Thanks.

798
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:15,691
Vic?

799
01:20:21,185 --> 01:20:22,240
Vic?

800
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:27,409
Vic, came out right

801
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,011
Vic?

802
01:20:34,674 --> 01:20:37,881
All of them thought I
it would be safe behind the shield.

803
01:20:40,608 --> 01:20:41,934
Good God

804
01:20:42,555 --> 01:20:45,676
The machine worked with me,
it can work with you as well.

805
01:20:45,711 --> 01:20:49,127
But it worked Ben,
it worked perfectly.

806
01:20:50,433 --> 01:20:54,128
- You planned that.
- I always wanted the power.

807
01:20:54,163 --> 01:20:58,721
And now I have one
infinite quantity.

808
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:01,375
And Thing none is
in your way.

809
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:07,321
Look for me, Ben. It is as soon as a man
how accepted your destiny seems

810
01:21:10,983 --> 01:21:13,920
An eliminated, they lack three.

811
01:21:14,325 --> 01:21:18,262
- Vic?
- Well in the hour.

812
01:21:18,516 --> 01:21:23,038
Ben?
did what be you did?

813
01:21:23,073 --> 01:21:28,012
Exactly what I said that he would do.
I built one be better and stronger

814
01:21:28,047 --> 01:21:30,902
besides overcoming the great
Reed Richards.

815
01:21:30,937 --> 01:21:32,897
You if you expose the tempest.

816
01:21:32,898 --> 01:21:35,607
It is risking your life.
It needs a help

817
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:37,567
Always the know-it-all.

818
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:42,754
Tell me, what happens
when if super-heats rubber?

819
01:22:16,242 --> 01:22:19,871
Mr. Von Doom,
does you feel well

820
01:22:19,906 --> 01:22:22,083
I never was better, Jimmy.

821
01:22:33,147 --> 01:22:37,317
why this little expensive?
We will talk in my office.

822
01:22:56,983 --> 01:22:59,775
Ben? Ben...

823
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:04,531
- Sweat.
- Johnny, the machine worked.

824
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,370
Help me here.

825
01:23:06,692 --> 01:23:10,272
- Ben.
- Pick his arm.

826
01:23:12,114 --> 01:23:14,929
It is all right, Ben?
Put him there on top

827
01:23:14,964 --> 01:23:17,953
what happened, garotão?
I vanish for five minutes...

828
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:22,661
The machine.
Victor used at the same

829
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:25,350
He was affected by the
cloud as well, as we.

830
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:28,080
- Where is Reed?
- Vic should have catch him.

831
01:23:32,213 --> 01:23:38,882
Dr. Richards. Allow me
start to class. Basic chemistry.

832
01:23:39,025 --> 01:23:43,797
what happens with rubber
when we cool her to the maximum?

833
01:23:47,724 --> 01:23:49,311
It gives up?

834
01:23:51,854 --> 01:23:53,815
That are not you, Reed.

835
01:23:58,311 --> 01:24:02,086
After all
both of us are scientists.

836
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:09,840
Painful? You do not know
the meaning of this word.

837
01:24:17,296 --> 01:24:20,823
A little thing that I took
of some contracts won.

838
01:24:25,114 --> 01:24:27,677
We will catch the rest
of the family.

839
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,968
Oh, no!

840
01:24:39,414 --> 01:24:41,988
- You need to leave from here.
- I had an idea.

841
01:24:42,213 --> 01:24:44,971
- Do not even think about that
- I never think.

842
01:24:45,006 --> 01:24:47,937
what is doing?
Johnny, no!

843
01:24:53,268 --> 01:24:55,161

We can transform in the that I was.

868
01:28:12,324 --> 01:28:15,619
He is alone a little exaggerated, right?

869
01:28:15,654 --> 01:28:18,388
Perhaps the next time
you listen me before ...

870
01:28:18,947 --> 01:28:20,924

889
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:42,441
Johnny, Very young!

890
01:31:42,503 --> 01:31:44,016
I thought we had agreed
how Very young was bad.

891
01:31:44,051 --> 01:31:45,051

quickly molten metal?

899

01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:48,753
And I think it remakes
the electric system...

910
01:34:48,754 --> 01:34:50,332
Do not worry
