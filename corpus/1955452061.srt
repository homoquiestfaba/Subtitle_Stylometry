1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,596
<i>Previously on "marvel's
agents of s.H.I.E.L.D."...</i>

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,853
I've been inside your brain.

3
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:08,223
I know what you want,
or, rather... Whom.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,827
Our may life model decoy
should get us the darkhold.

5
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:13,528
And if something goes wrong...

6
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,363
Then we have a second lmd.

7
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:17,566
I still care about you, fitz.

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,678
I've got to hand it
to radcliffe.

9
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,502
You certainly act like it.

10
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:22,237
Looks like you have a problem.

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,284
I said I needed your protection.
Now you can see why.

12
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:25,607
You'll have to meet
the superior.

13
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,175
Whatever it takes.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,188
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

15
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:42,858
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

16
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:46,194
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,529
Curse my metal body!

18
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,197
I wasn't fast enough!

19
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,132
Help me, obi-wan.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,976
God.

21
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,477
I think I'm gonna stick with.

22
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:04,212
The "one foot
in front of the other".

23
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:06,281
Method of self-propulsion.

24
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,582
Just relax.

25
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:08,950
Keep practicing.

26
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,219
I'll go get us another round.

27
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:27,269
Who's your
zombie-killing daddy now?

28
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:28,737
Bam.

29
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,143
I'm telling you, he's right...

30
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,278
Aah!

31
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:38,146
Leo. Leo, do you copy?

32
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,588
Sam to billy. Sam to billy!

33
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,658
There's nowhere to go!

34
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,327
Surrender,
and you will not be harmed!

35
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,969
I'll give you
to the count of three!

36
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,971
1, 2...

37
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,173
He's everywhere!

38
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,841
He's getting away, you idiot!

39
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,157
Throw him in!

40
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:25,193
Let's go!

41
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,401
Agent coulson,
this is agent koenig.

42
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:34,970
They've got agent koenig.

43
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,372
I repeat...
They've got agent koenig!

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,014
Which one?

45
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:47,082
Billy.

46
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:49,050
He was abducted an hour ago.

47
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,318
Any possible motive?

48
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:51,386
He has the darkhold.

49
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,387
I gave it to him.

50
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,466
Because he knows
how to make things disappear.

51
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,523
<i>And now someone's
made him disappear.</i>

52
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,591
Can't be a coincidence.

53
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:58,827
May's the only one who would
know I gave it to billy,

54
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:01,096
So I think we know where
to point the finger.

55
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:02,163
Radcliffe.

56
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,043
He's been desperate
to get his hands on that book,

57
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,167
And he's had eyes and ears
on this base.

58
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,435
For god knows how long.

59
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:10,105
But still, kidnapping a koenig?

60
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,507
That's like catching moonlight.

61
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,209
<i>We can't even find them
half the time.</i>

62
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:16,244
If radcliffe has aligned himself
with nadeer,

63
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,013
They'd have the resources
to find him.

64
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:20,348
Why would he join forces
with public inhuman hater ♪1?

65
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:21,783
He has nothing against us.

66
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:23,251
She's got to be
a means to an end.

67
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,420
He needs access and protection.

68
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,421
Davis?

69
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,756
They picked up agent koenig.

70
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,290
His quinjet
will be docking shortly.

71
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:31,526
Hopefully, sam will have
some more information for us.

72
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,094
If we can find who took billy,

73
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,474
We may be able to connect them
back to nadeer.

74
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,231
And radcliffe?

75
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,700
Fitz is working on it.

76
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:43,605
I'm not going to let this
come between us.

77
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,474
What's the occasional bullet
in the head among friends?

78
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,009
Done.

79
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,713
Now talk. Where's radcliffe?

80
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:54,082
I'm right in front of you,
and...

81
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,584
You've paralyzed me
from the neck down.

82
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,586
Hey.

83
00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:00,221
Where is he?

84
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:02,557
Sorry, fitz.

85
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:05,326
You don't get to shoot first
and ask questions later.

86
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,997
We'll shoot
whenever we damn please.

87
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:09,898
And this time,

88
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,666
Nobody's gonna
put you back together again.

89
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:16,337
What I meant is, I don't
precisely know where I...

90
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:21,342
Where dr. Radcliffe currently is
at this precise moment.

91
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,511
I could be out for a walk
or getting groceries.

92
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:24,679
That's enough.

93
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:26,481
Hey, hey,
I need his cpu in one piece,

94
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,916
Not scattered all over the lab.

95
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:30,085
I'm not trying to be difficult.

96
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,654
You need to understand...

97
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,422
I'm the victim.

98
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,792
Things are not as they seem.

99
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,478
You two will want
to get acquainted.

100
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:59,647
You're the last one
the other's gonna see alive.

101
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,349
Yeah, well, we're ready to die.

102
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,384
No!

103
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,052
No. No, no, no, no.

104
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,453
<i>I'm extremely not ready to die.</i>

105
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:07,188
Cut off my fingers,
eat my liver,

106
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,056
It doesn't matter.

107
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,824
Nothing you do
is gonna make me talk.

108
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,370
You must've sustained
some brain damage.

109
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,961
During your last torture.

110
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:14,395
That...

111
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,997
Wasn't torture.

112
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,371
That was a greeting.

113
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,910
Now...

114
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,578
The one who comes
in this room next...

115
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,583
Won't be me.

116
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:42,524
The man who comes in here
will do things to you...

117
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,826
That I can't even watch.

118
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,228
He will break you.

119
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,266
Yeah, well, koenigs don't break.

120
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,301
All right?

121
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,936
We're programmed to take pain,
so bring it on!

122
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,004
Bring it on!

123
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,541
My god. I'm in so much pain.

124
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,042
I don't think I can take this.

125
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:02,510
That guy hits really hard.

126
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:04,612
Do you have any,
any, like, cyanide or...

127
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,247
Cyanide? Why would I...

128
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,348
Or, like, a paper bag.

129
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:08,516
You put it over my head,

130
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,218
You suffocate me really quick.

131
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,120
This is all my fault.
I'm so sorry.

132
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:15,523
Who are you?
Dr. Holden radcliffe.

133
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,091
I work for s.H.I.E.L.D., too.

134
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,394
I'm afraid
I'm the reason you're here.

135
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,897
I told them
coulson gave you the book.

136
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,032
The boo... what book?

137
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:27,035
The darkhold.

138
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,169
My friend,

139
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,572
I made some questionable
allegiances to get ahold of it,

140
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,440
And they double-crossed me.

141
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,341
That's...

142
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,410
That's why we're here,
wherever here is.

143
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,489
Agent koenig, welcome aboard.

144
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,558
Agent coulson, agent may...

145
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:53,795
A... agent quake.

146
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,630
Yeah. What's the latest, sam?

147
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,731
Any sign of billy?

148
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:59,901
Well, I found the humvee
at the end of a dock, but...

149
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:00,969
No one there.

150
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,303
No, they either evaporated.

151
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,572
Or dove into the sea.

152
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:14,515
My intent was...
Was purely scientific.

153
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:17,318
But, the things I saw...

154
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,687
It was expanding my brain
and my reality...

155
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:20,833
You're getting
all gollum-y again.

156
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,501
Well, that's... that's what
the darkhold does to you...

157
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,691
It drives you mad.

158
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:28,129
Yeah, maybe you should tell them
where the book is.

159
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:29,597
<i>Let it drive them mad.</i>

160
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,168
I am the captain of this ship,

161
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:08,569
And you are my prisoners.

162
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:10,571
If you cooperate,

163
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:13,007
You will be treated
as welcomed guests.

164
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:17,045
If not, you will be removed...

165
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,547
Piece...

166
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,982
By piece.

167
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:23,751
That... that...
That won't be necessary.

168
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,164
Vodka.

169
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,634
Perfectly chilled, pure.

170
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,804
The onion enhances
the experience.

171
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,906
But people forget the old ways.

172
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:22,276
Now they'll put flavors
in it... vanilla...

173
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,213
The old ways are better.

174
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:27,448
Simple, built to last.

175
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,217
Like this submarine.

176
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,654
Modern machines...

177
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,723
All software, less hardware.

178
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,925
You put too much faith in them.

179
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:41,028
Man is the superior machine.

180
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:45,633
And i...

181
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:50,371
Am the superior man.

182
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,782
I'm told you refuse to talk...

183
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,851
And that you welcome pain.

184
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:06,287
I, too, love pain.

185
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,793
And I love
to make others feel it.

186
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,694
Using the old ways.

187
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:18,833
All right, stop! Enough.

188
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,168
Enough!

189
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,037
Senator nadeer promised me.

190
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,373
He wouldn't be
permanently damaged.

191
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:27,308
She's not the captain
of this ship.

192
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,677
Yes, I understand.

193
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,746
But he isn't going to talk.

194
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,117
What do you suggest, doctor?

195
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:42,657
Let me get inside his head.

196
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,963
This is a complete.

197
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,309
And unacceptable invasion
of my privacy.

198
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,567
Well, since you refuse
to cooperate,

199
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:55,670
Fitz is going to reprogram you
to sing like a canary.

200
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:57,472
That seems odd.

201
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:59,373
Singing I can understand,
perhaps,

202
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,641
<i>But singing like a bird?</i>

203
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:02,376
Why not mick jagger?

204
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:04,579
Whoa.

205
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:07,048
What is that?

206
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,584
That's nothing like aida's code.
That's nothing like anything.

207
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,221
What the hell is going on?

208
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,423
I don't know...

209
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,224
This code is advanced.

210
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,226
It's like
fifth-generation syntax.

211
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,861
I've never seen
anything like it.

212
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:22,763
Every time
I keep trying to alter it,

213
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,165
It kicks me right back to the...

214
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,670
<i>Amicitiae nostrae memoriam
spero sempiternam fore.</i>

215
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:30,872
Fitz...

216
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:34,408
<i>Vir sapit qui pauca loquitur.</i>

217
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,177
<i>Alea iacta est.</i>

218
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,586
The only thing worse than
a robot is a possessed one.

219
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,256
I agree. That was no fun.

220
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,291
Where's daisy when we need her?

221
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,293
Who developed the code?!

222
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:53,628
Who programmed you?!

223
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:56,697
Was it radcliffe? Aida?

224
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,608
I can't see their faces.

225
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,143
<i>They're both russian? Da.</i>

226
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,611
<i>Da, I'm lucky to be alive.</i>

227
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,048
I love billy,
but he is not a fighter.

228
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,149
He ran.

229
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,484
He left me there to handle it.

230
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,486
No, that's...

231
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,754
<i>That's billy.</i>

232
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:20,621
That's him kicking ass,

233
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,490
And that's you,
hiding behind the bar.

234
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,258
No, I... I think you got us...

235
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:25,960
I think you
got us flipped, there.

236
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,163
I mean, you're...

237
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:32,266
You're literally wearing
the same thing right now.

238
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,502
We have no idea what billy did
with the darkhold.

239
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:35,469
<i>I didn't want to know.</i>

240
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,437
That was the whole point
in giving it to him.

241
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:38,739
Well, we need to get it back
and destroy it.

242
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:39,974
If you'd given it to me...

243
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,142
<i>And they'd have you now.</i>

244
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,310
I wanted to protect you,

245
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,156
And the koenigs have dealt
with this kind of thing before.

246
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,324
You don't need
to protect me, phil.

247
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,314
I know.

248
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,082
But I've lost too much lately.

249
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:49,483
<i>I'm not gonna lose you.</i>

250
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,430
Both the guys who tried
to assassinate the director.

251
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:53,521
Were russian.
This has to be connected.

252
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,434
Maybe there's, like,
a "red dawn" thing happening,

253
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,635
But what does it have to do
with billy?

254
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:57,558
They don't want billy.

255
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,460
They want something
I entrusted to him.

256
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,929
Did... what...

257
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,432
Is it... Smaller than a quinjet?

258
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:05,700
That's classified.

259
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,535
And yes, considerably.

260
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,536
Okay.

261
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:09,870
We have face.

262
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,706
Hello, russian bad guy.

263
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:12,707
Okay.

264
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:13,975
Run facial recognition.

265
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,944
See if we come up with a lead.

266
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,385
I don't care what this is
or what you guys do.

267
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,720
I'm not gonna talk.

268
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:27,989
You won't have to.
That's the beauty of it.

269
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:30,524
This machine will allow me
access to his mind.

270
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,504
We'll get all the information we
need without laying a hand on him.

271
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,895
Well, you're not gonna get
anything out of me.

272
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:36,530
Because my mind is a steel trap.

273
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,366
Inside of a sealed box.

274
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,701
Surrounded by quicksand and...

275
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,303
Is that a puppy?

276
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,415
We've given him
a sedative scenario.

277
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:46,674
To keep him relaxed while we map
his cerebral matter.

278
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,877
That'll allow me to have
a look around inside his mind.

279
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,879
This book better be worth it.

280
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,514
If you want to get rid
of the inhumans,

281
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,283
The answer will be in it.

282
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:58,519
And what's in it for you?

283
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,656
A better world.

284
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:04,258
Then we want the same thing.

285
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:11,565
You're staring at me.

286
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,700
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,902
I just... I can't believe
I'm sitting here with quake!

288
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,437
You know, this is...

289
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,339
Somebody pinch me.

290
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:19,707
Sam, stop.

291
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,609
We've known each other
for three years.

292
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:25,112
<i>Yeah, I knew skye,
but you're... you're quake.</i>

293
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:26,514
She's different.

294
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:27,515
No, she's not.

295
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,785
<i>And she doesn't love
the name quake.</i>

296
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,853
But you're...
You're a superhero!

297
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,455
I mean, that's so awesome!

298
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,424
Did you know that online,

299
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,193
There's a library
of fan fiction about quake?

300
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,761
Did not need to know that.

301
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,596
Well, you should google it.

302
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,465
Because it's... it's...

303
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,200
Actually, no, you shouldn't.

304
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:47,568
You shouldn't.
Forget I said that.

305
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:50,071
Some of it is a little
on the steamier side.

306
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,605
Not that I've read it!

307
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,140
You... but you hear things.

308
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:54,208
Wow.

309
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:56,877
I mean, they got you
'shipping with black widow.

310
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,913
Some of the drawings are...

311
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,949
They... they call you quack.

312
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,151
Good timing.

313
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:05,920
We have a match.

314
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,621
Leo babikov.

315
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,990
Ex-svr, special ops...

316
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:12,126
The same special ops division
the two men.

317
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,572
Who tried to assassinate
the director were in.

318
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,463
And there's our link to nadeer.
Get this.

319
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,732
They all have ties
to prime minister olshenko.

320
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,501
The russian prime minister who
was attacked by an inhuman...

321
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,837
And then threw bobbi and hunter
under the bus.

322
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:24,839
After they saved his life.
This is bad.

323
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:27,441
We got nadeer,
international watchdogs,

324
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:29,744
And russian spies all united
because...

325
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:30,678
Because they hate inhumans.

326
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:32,880
Yeah, that's why
they want the darkhold.

327
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,518
'Cause it'll show them
how to wipe out the inhumans.

328
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:39,286
You knew billy had the darkhold?

329
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,599
Well, yeah,
I couldn't say anything.

330
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,256
With all the red shirts
hanging around.

331
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,625
Do you know what he did with it?

332
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,927
It is secure.

333
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:49,663
I'd like to help you,

334
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,533
But honestly,
I have some trust issues.

335
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,668
Trust?

336
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,037
<i>You betrayed me.</i>

337
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:58,672
Fitz, it's not radcliffe.

338
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,808
Yeah, I know it's not!
But he thinks like he does.

339
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:02,543
Betrayed me,
betrayed s.H.I.E.L.D.,

340
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:03,411
He made me lie to you,

341
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:05,312
And he made me think
he was my friend.

342
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:07,882
Just to use me.

343
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,650
You were like a son to me.

344
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:13,421
Shut up. Just... Shut up.

345
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,190
What's this really about?

346
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,324
He said shut up.

347
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,326
You can do it the easy way...

348
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:20,472
Why don't you just turn him off?

349
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:22,563
He needs to be powered on
to access his programming,

350
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,398
Not that it matters.
I'm not getting anywhere.

351
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,301
We all have programming.

352
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,503
It may be more obvious
in my case,

353
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:32,139
But what is a human if not
a function of programming?

354
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:35,910
You've been programmed...
By betrayal, abandonment...

355
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:37,878
Ward, who you thought
was your friend,

356
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,682
Daisy who left you all,
your father...

357
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:44,552
He's just trying
to distract you.

358
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,753
Let's step away.

359
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:51,892
It's not him, it's me.

360
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,228
I can't do it.

361
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,896
It's way beyond me.

362
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,731
That's your father talking.

363
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,769
Isn't that
what he used to say to you?

364
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:05,072
Not enough, not smart enough?

365
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:10,578
Why would you say that?

366
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,247
Because I knew him.

367
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,811
I wanted to tell you,

368
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:20,880
But I was afraid
it would open old wounds.

369
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,149
That's not possible.

370
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:25,885
Glasgow isn't that big, fitz.

371
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,987
Your father and I
were classmates,

372
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:29,922
St. Mungo's at eastwood.

373
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:32,024
Fitz, it's lying. No.

374
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:32,925
How would he...

375
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,761
How would radcliffe
know those things?

376
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,162
Maybe he had access
to your files.

377
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:39,665
This is a... a firewall.

378
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,345
It's playing mind games,
trying to distract you,

379
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,935
Because it knows
you'll crack the code.

380
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,436
No, I won't!

381
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:46,238
<i>He knows it, so do you.</i>

382
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,740
That's not true.

383
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,341
Actually, your exact quote was,

384
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:51,911
"where's daisy
when we need her?"

385
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,445
That's not what I meant.

386
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,925
Let's wipe its memory,
give it to mack.

387
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,949
We'll find radcliffe
another way.

388
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,018
I like that plan.
We weren't friends,

389
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:02,087
But we'd take the same train
to the city for work.

390
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,089
Sometimes we sat together.

391
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:08,928
One time, he showed me a picture
of his new son, leopold.

392
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,296
He was so proud.

393
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:13,232
I swear
I'm telling the truth, fitz.

394
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:14,767
I can prove it.

395
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,236
I saw him a few months ago.

396
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:20,039
He said I was to tell you...

397
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:36,155
How long does this take?

398
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,389
Not much longer.

399
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:40,025
Please be patient.

400
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:43,629
While we're waiting,
perhaps you could tell me.

401
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,599
Why you dislike the inhumans
so much.

402
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:49,835
<i>Yes, some of them are monsters,
true, but...</i>

403
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,304
These inhumans...

404
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,075
They did not suffer,
labor to become what they are.

405
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,243
They have great power...

406
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,146
But they didn't earn it.

407
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,016
They are unnatural things.

408
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,619
We will destroy them...

409
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:10,222
And then the thing
that brought them upon us.

410
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,658
And what was that?

411
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,160
Cerebral cortex mapping
is complete.

412
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,596
You may now enter his memories.

413
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:21,033
One thing at a time, doctor.

414
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,674
What?

415
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,010
Where's my puppy?
Who took my puppy?

416
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,611
Take him to the brig.

417
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,381
Aah.

418
00:19:45,993 --> 00:19:47,359
All right.

419
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,161
Here we go.

420
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:53,999
Take me to the darkhold,
agent koenig.

421
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:58,804
He's making something.

422
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,072
I see wires...

423
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,174
God.

424
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:05,377
He's building a bomb
to destroy the darkhold.

425
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,747
Never mind. False alarm.

426
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:11,383
You can't underestimate
radcliffe.

427
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,530
We have to assume he's gonna get
the information out of billy.

428
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:14,920
Impossible.

429
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:16,021
How can you be so sure?

430
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:17,756
He doesn't know where it is.

431
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:18,857
<i>He gave it to me.</i>

432
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:19,925
This isn't right.

433
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,862
<i>I'm in his head,
but I'm also seeing him.</i>

434
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:26,498
Doesn't make sense, unless...

435
00:20:27,702 --> 00:20:30,069
He doesn't have it.

436
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,038
You sent us after the wrong man?

437
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:35,174
No, he had it,
but he gave it to someone.

438
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:39,111
Who looks just like him...
A brother or...

439
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,180
Or a replica.

440
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,949
Where is it? I don't know.

441
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,551
You just said
billy gave it to you.

442
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:47,219
He did. You forgot
where you hid it?

443
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:49,254
No, I didn't hide it.
So you still have it?

444
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,789
No. Then what did
you do with it?

445
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:52,191
I gave it to agent koenig.

446
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,270
You gave it back to billy?
Negative.

447
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,060
Then who?

448
00:20:55,096 --> 00:20:56,573
Who's l.T.? Special agent I.T.
Koenig.

449
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:57,429
There's another one?

450
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,198
<i>No, not just another one.</i>

451
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,933
<i>The first one.</i>

452
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,436
L.T. Got us all
into s.H.I.E.L.D.

453
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,904
We have to pick up l.T.

454
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,340
I don't think any koenig
is safe right now.

455
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:10,976
How's fitz doing?

456
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:15,147
That rad-bot was really
getting under his skin.

457
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:16,548
He'll be fine.

458
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,951
He just needs some space
at the moment.

459
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:23,956
What was all that about... His father?

460
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,891
Fitz never mentioned him before.

461
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,893
He was not a good man.

462
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:30,763
Always telling fitz
he was stupid and worthless.

463
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:32,965
I think that's why fitz
became so clever.

464
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:36,435
I'd like to have
a few words with that man.

465
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,570
You and me both.

466
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:41,740
But he walked out on them
when fitz was 10.

467
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:44,576
He hasn't seen
or heard from him since.

468
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:46,779
So you're telling me
with all the tools and tech.

469
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:48,514
That s.H.I.E.L.D. Has
at its disposal,

470
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:50,582
We can't find him? We could.

471
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:53,352
But fitz doesn't want to.

472
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,358
You guys got anything?

473
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:01,326
This is l.T. Koenig's
last known location.

474
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,327
Negative.

475
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,797
Just a lot of man-buns.

476
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:12,604
Got your green tea.

477
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,139
Thank you.

478
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:15,307
Any news?

479
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:16,375
Nothing yet.

480
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,644
I hope we're not too late.

481
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,779
Those koenigs are tough,

482
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,359
But they've been through
enough already.

483
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,350
We all have. That's the game.

484
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,286
I guess we should be grateful.

485
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:29,655
After all the years,
all the missions,

486
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,323
All the close calls...

487
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:33,358
Both our deaths. Right.

488
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,394
After all that,
we're still standing,

489
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:36,962
The two of us.

490
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:38,964
Maybe we should toast to that.

491
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:50,142
We've been,
making a lot of toasts lately.

492
00:22:51,212 --> 00:22:54,379
Maybe we should try
something else.

493
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:02,321
Guys, I think you need
to get in here.

494
00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:05,557
On our way.

495
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,231
Welcome to the inside
of my mind, sheeple.

496
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,701
You guys watching any,
any good programming lately?

497
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:17,870
You know why they call it
"programming," right?

498
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:21,707
Because you're being programmed
through little screens,

499
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:24,443
Big screens,
little morphine drips.

500
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:27,713
Of sequels and prequels
and zombies and kanyes,

501
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:30,415
Snapchats and grumpy cats,

502
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:35,254
All designed by the media,
corporate s.H.I.E.L.D. Machine,

503
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,724
And you're asleep,
binge-watching the apocalypse!

504
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,626
You know what tony stark's armor
is powered by?

505
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:41,493
What is this?

506
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,106
Did these guys
come off an assembly line?

507
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,697
Outside. Now.

508
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:49,968
Who are you?! Why are you here?!

509
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:51,603
Drop your weapon.

510
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,771
Stand down!

511
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,640
Hey, hey, hey!

512
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:56,375
What are you doing?
You're ruining my set!

513
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,721
You were doing that
all by yourself.

514
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:00,212
It's all right.
We're with s.H.I.E.L.D..

515
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:01,713
No! You can't be in here!

516
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:03,916
This is a peace palace.

517
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:05,083
Hey, hey, hey.

518
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,084
Ho, ho.

519
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,464
S.H.I.E.L.D. Storm troopers
have got to go.

520
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,488
Hey...

521
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,325
Coulson,
what are you doing here?

522
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,426
Sam sent us.

523
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:16,561
Billy's in trouble,
and you could be in danger, too.

524
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:17,930
And who's this one?

525
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:19,231
That's thurston.

526
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:22,467
He's an idiot,
and, unfortunately, my brother.

527
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,337
Agent l.T. Koenig.

528
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:28,840
Sorry about
kicking your candy ass.

529
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:34,730
You ice'd me!

530
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,898
She ice'd me, and now I'm aboard
your war bird!

531
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,800
Stop being a whiny little bitch.

532
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:41,069
We brought you here
for your own protection.

533
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,070
My own protec...

534
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,705
I don't want your protection.

535
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:46,041
I don't want anything to do
with your agents of doom.

536
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:47,175
What happened to you?

537
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,211
We had the same parents,
same teachers,

538
00:24:49,246 --> 00:24:50,846
Same liquor cabinet.

539
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:53,849
Your brothers toughened up,
joined the cause...

540
00:24:53,884 --> 00:24:55,550
Yeah, that worked out great
for eric.

541
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:57,152
He'd be alive
if it wasn't for you!

542
00:24:57,187 --> 00:24:59,688
Eric died so good people
could live and do good things.

543
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:01,890
What good have you done
for the world?

544
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:03,425
Okay, okay, guys, guys, hey.

545
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,826
We're family, okay? Okay?

546
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,895
Eric wouldn't have wanted this.

547
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,265
So let's bring it in
for a little koenig krush.

548
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,666
Here you go.

549
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:13,903
God!

550
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:16,738
What was that for?! You
let your guard down.

551
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:17,884
Didn't I teach you anything?

552
00:25:17,908 --> 00:25:19,040
We were having a moment.

553
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:19,908
It was nice.

554
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:21,743
Grow 'em back now.
It's time to work.

555
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,111
Okay. Can I go home?

556
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,246
Sorry, thurston.

557
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:26,915
We can't let you leave
'til we know what's going on.

558
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,117
These gentlemen
will take you to your room.

559
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,520
If you need anything,
just let them know.

560
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,727
I think I have a lead on billy.

561
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:41,596
Okay,
so, after they left the svr,

562
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,366
Our russian bad boys were
employed as security officers.

563
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:46,768
For a weapons-manufacturing firm
linked to...

564
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:50,272
This guy... yegor ivanov,
a reclusive industrialist.

565
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:51,807
With interests
all over the globe.

566
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,482
Could be the source
of nadeer's financing.

567
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,944
He's also an avid collector
of military antiques,

568
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:58,780
So guns, tanks,
and... A submarine.

569
00:25:58,816 --> 00:25:59,881
Bingo.

570
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,483
Throw everything you have at it.

571
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,884
We find him, we find billy,

572
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,386
Maybe a way
to bring down nadeer.

573
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:05,987
At least we know
the darkhold's safe.

574
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,823
Right, l.T.?

575
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,825
That's the bad news.

576
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,393
I gave it to billy.

577
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:12,794
What? What?

578
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,930
It was operation hot potato.

579
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:17,599
Pass it back and forth,
keep it moving.

580
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:19,434
Billy was the last to have it.

581
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,837
So my guess is,
he put it in the labyrinth.

582
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,939
What's the labyrinth?

583
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:25,640
It's a top-secret
s.H.I.E.L.D. Vault.

584
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:27,275
Only the koenigs
know its location.

585
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:28,311
We need to get there.

586
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:30,245
Before they get the information
out of billy.

587
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:34,816
Now we're getting somewhere.

588
00:26:34,852 --> 00:26:39,087
Aida, remember these numbers...
74638.

589
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:50,799
812.

590
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:59,875
94573.

591
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,478
10168.

592
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:10,952
99438.

593
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,162
Got it.

594
00:27:21,198 --> 00:27:22,864
Now turn this boat around.

595
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,966
I give the orders on this ship.

596
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:28,003
Your tone sounds threatening.

597
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:41,049
Now, let's not lose our heads.

598
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:43,919
What seems to be
the problem here?

599
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,588
You put too much faith
in machines.

600
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:50,525
I'm going to go get the
information out of him my way.

601
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:52,561
If it's the same, then we go.

602
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:53,662
Absolutely not.

603
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:55,096
I won't allow it.

604
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,065
Get them out of here.

605
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:12,414
Aah!

606
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,885
You brought an inhuman
on my ship?

607
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,121
She's a machine.

608
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,357
Aida, release him.

609
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:23,792
Aah!

610
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,932
You... Made her?

611
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:33,068
With my own hands.

612
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:35,937
Simple, built to last.

613
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:38,974
Now turn this boat around.

614
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,041
Please?

615
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,755
I keep telling myself

616
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,057
I don't care
if radcliffe knows my father,

617
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:57,058
I'm over it, but...

618
00:28:57,094 --> 00:28:59,160
Maybe I'm not.

619
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:04,599
Maybe I'm stuck in a loop.

620
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:07,235
Radcliffe...

621
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,970
Ward...

622
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,905
My dad...

623
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,242
They're all the same.

624
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:15,477
It keeps happening.

625
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:18,346
I don't see it that way.

626
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,015
Come on, jemma.

627
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,450
You know that it's true.

628
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,120
Yes, they betrayed you.

629
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:27,288
And after everything
you've been through,

630
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:30,425
No one would blame you
if you put up your own firewall.

631
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:33,094
But you didn't.

632
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,163
Instead, you became.

633
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:40,201
The most open, loyal,
caring person I've ever met.

634
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,203
Maybe that's why
it keeps happening.

635
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,705
It's why
I fell in love with you.

636
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,108
Who you really are,
that's not programming.

637
00:29:47,144 --> 00:29:49,978
It's something way beyond that.

638
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:56,451
That's it.

639
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:57,852
Jemma...

640
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,258
You're the best.

641
00:30:08,065 --> 00:30:11,199
Just you and me now, tin man.

642
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:13,368
You don't mess with my buddy.

643
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,036
And walk away from it.

644
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:17,205
If you shoot me now,
it'll be murder.

645
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,406
Nice try.

646
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,307
Wrong guy.

647
00:30:19,342 --> 00:30:22,177
You're just
a bunch of ones and zeroes,

648
00:30:22,212 --> 00:30:23,845
Not flesh and blood.

649
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,014
Flesh and blood?

650
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,315
That's not life, mack.

651
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,818
That's just biology,
and biology is just...

652
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:32,220
Software programming you to die.

653
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:33,154
Maybe.

654
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,191
But I have something
you will never have...

655
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:37,826
A soul...

656
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:39,694
That will continue
long after I'm gone.

657
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,064
<i>How can you be so sure
I don't have one?</i>

658
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,834
If a soul doesn't come
from your flesh and blood.

659
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:47,001
Or my ones and zeroes,

660
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:49,037
Then it has to come from
somewhere else,

661
00:30:49,072 --> 00:30:51,706
Somewhere unrelated
to our physical bodies.

662
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:54,042
If you can have one, so can i.

663
00:30:55,112 --> 00:30:57,212
You are a sly one, aren't you?

664
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:01,916
If you don't think I'm alive
and don't have a soul,

665
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:05,220
Then why did you feel the need
to switch me on.

666
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:06,421
Before killing me?

667
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:09,591
I like to hear robots scream.

668
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:10,959
Mack! Stop!

669
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,427
Wait.

670
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,430
I know a way around
his programming.

671
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:22,871
If you don't stop,

672
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:24,472
You're gonna cause
irreparable damage.

673
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,808
You'll never learn
what your father said.

674
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,744
Don't care.
I'm out of that loop.

675
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,279
You want to tell me
what's going on?

676
00:31:31,314 --> 00:31:32,380
Something jemma said.

677
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:34,315
We're more than our programming.

678
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:37,118
There's something else...

679
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:38,319
All right, look.

680
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,121
I give up. I'm ready to talk.

681
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:41,956
What do you need to know?

682
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:44,492
<i>He couldn't crack the code
because it wasn't a code.</i>

683
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,327
It's just a bunch of gibberish.

684
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,395
So what's running him?

685
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,430
You... you... you telling me
thing is a... alive?

686
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:51,633
Fitz, please. Stop.

687
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,802
No, of course not.

688
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:55,737
All I'm saying is...

689
00:32:03,947 --> 00:32:05,914
It has a brain.

690
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,320
L.T., stay with quake
and agent may.

691
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:15,290
Agent coulson, come with me.

692
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:18,193
I'm going with them.

693
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,802
So, what was it like
growing up with four of them?

694
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:29,337
There was a lot of crying.

695
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:30,338
They picked on you?

696
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:31,673
<i>I picked on them.</i>

697
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,807
It was fun.

698
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:34,509
The laundry was disgusting.

699
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:36,511
Enough dna to make a clone army.

700
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,722
Okay.

701
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,725
Wait here. I'll be right back.

702
00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:01,803
So... Read any
good books lately?

703
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,638
Imagine how big
our brains would be.

704
00:33:03,673 --> 00:33:05,340
If we had time to read them all.

705
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:12,513
It's made of light,

706
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:15,817
But it's functioning like
a corporeal, biological brain.

707
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:17,385
Quantum energy storing data...

708
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,988
It's as if synapses
are interacting.

709
00:33:20,023 --> 00:33:21,256
Is that possible?

710
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,357
No.

711
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:24,559
No, not even in the slightest.

712
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:26,494
I wish I could take credit,

713
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:29,197
But this was all aida
and the darkhold.

714
00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:30,576
<i>Everything
in the original brains...</i>

715
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,367
Memories, knowledge, desires...

716
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:34,369
<i>Is contained
in the quantum brains.</i>

717
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:36,404
So, you see, I re...
You said "brains."

718
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:39,841
My god.

719
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:41,576
Is it possible?

720
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,679
What? Talk to me.

721
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:46,948
Radcliffe mapped another brain.

722
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,449
I saw it. I watched him do it.

723
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,717
You can't be serious.

724
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:53,021
It was may.

725
00:33:59,062 --> 00:34:01,729
I never read "ulysses."

726
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:04,399
I always wanted
to take a month off,

727
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:06,935
Go to ireland, read it in pubs.

728
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:09,904
Someday.

729
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,843
Maybe we should go together.

730
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,214
Yeah?

731
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:24,118
It's a little nerdy.

732
00:34:25,588 --> 00:34:27,455
Did you mean it when you said.

733
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,924
You're ready
for whatever comes next?

734
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:43,538
We've got company!

735
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,308
Hey, what's... what's going on?

736
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:48,776
Three men, armed,

737
00:34:48,812 --> 00:34:50,478
Heading our way,
and they've got billy.

738
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:51,612
All right. Take this.

739
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:54,115
We'll handle it.

740
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,316
Here.

741
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:56,584
Give it to me.

742
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:59,754
No need for you
to be the target.

743
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:02,623
May?

744
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:07,028
What's going on? Give it to me.

745
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,333
I can't.

746
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,500
What are you doing, may?
Put the gun down.

747
00:35:17,524 --> 00:35:20,158
I'm sorry, coulson. I can't.

748
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:22,327
This is the right thing to do.

749
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:25,063
Leave me alone,
and I'll take care of it.

750
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:28,300
Destroy it, yeah.
That's the plan.

751
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,913
Now lower your damn weapon
and give me the darkhold!

752
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:31,469
I can't!

753
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:36,808
'Cause it's not
in your programming.

754
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,710
What are you talking about?

755
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:39,911
You're not may.

756
00:35:39,947 --> 00:35:41,580
Why would you say that?

757
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:44,382
Because there's some things
you can't fake.

758
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:46,885
He switched you, didn't he?

759
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,554
How long have you been...

760
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,060
So this is what radcliffe
programmed you to do?

761
00:35:55,095 --> 00:35:57,662
I didn't know
what my mission was.

762
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:00,665
Until I had my hands on it.

763
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:01,833
Where's the real may?

764
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,768
<i>I am the real may.</i>

765
00:36:03,804 --> 00:36:07,939
Her thoughts, her memories,
her desires...

766
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:10,208
That's all real.

767
00:36:10,244 --> 00:36:12,010
May would never betray me.

768
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,580
Radcliffe made some adjustments.

769
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,218
Aah!

770
00:36:21,288 --> 00:36:23,221
So, may's a freakin' robot.

771
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:25,690
How did you know?
Fitz and simmons...

772
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,093
Aah! Aah!

773
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:30,028
Aah!

774
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,932
Go.

775
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,971
No!

776
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:42,207
No!

777
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:48,813
Give us the book,
I'll give you your brother.

778
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:50,782
My brother?
What, are you kidding?

779
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,984
I've never seen this guy before
in my life.

780
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,653
You want the book?

781
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:57,789
Let him go.

782
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,968
What did they do to you, man?

783
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:12,170
They took my puppy.

784
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:13,038
Hey.

785
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:15,907
You're gonna be okay,
little brother.

786
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:29,354
So cool.

787
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,949
Grab billy and let's get
to the quinjet.

788
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:34,993
No!

789
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:57,949
Aah! Help!

790
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,951
May! What...

791
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,052
What happened?

792
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:02,554
Le me help you. Okay.

793
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:03,955
Wha...

794
00:38:10,764 --> 00:38:12,130
Hello, agent may.

795
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,633
Mission accomplished.

796
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,239
This is exactly
what you were supposed to do.

797
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:24,709
I'm eternally grateful.

798
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,345
Take me with you.

799
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:31,049
Please.

800
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:32,250
Sorry.

801
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:34,719
You weren't built to last.

802
00:38:42,396 --> 00:38:44,095
The labyrinth is compromised.

803
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:45,563
The deadliest tome in the world.

804
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,676
Is in the hands
of a mad scientist,

805
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,034
Who snuck out the back door
with cattle-prod man.

806
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,270
I'm... Sorry we let you down.

807
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:54,672
We now have the name
of the man who kidnapped you,

808
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,341
Who's probably
been funding nadeer,

809
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,776
Maybe even radcliffe.

810
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:59,711
Now we can hunt them
and stop them.

811
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:01,713
I st... I still can't believe.

812
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:04,349
He made a fully functioning
autonomous lmd.

813
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,017
<i>Yeah, put us to shame.</i>

814
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,053
Sam and billy were part
of the original lmd program.

815
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:10,889
Wait. Are you saying they're...

816
00:39:10,924 --> 00:39:13,258
Obsolete. Without a doubt.

817
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:14,392
So you all are...?

818
00:39:14,428 --> 00:39:16,795
Technicians.

819
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,897
What? You thought
they were robots?

820
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:25,570
Billy.

821
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:27,972
Thank god you're okay.

822
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:29,441
All right, there.

823
00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:30,975
All right, you.

824
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:33,211
You're still a sheep, though.
You're all sheep!

825
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,113
Well, the quinjet's ready
when you are.

826
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:36,648
We'll get you home safely.

827
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,950
As always,
thank you for your service.

828
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,585
Any time, coulson.

829
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,998
I hope this is the last of them.

830
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,834
There's still one more.

831
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:58,102
He couldn't destroy it. Not yet.

832
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:00,338
If we can't find the real may,
then...

833
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:05,577
That's all that's left of her.

834
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,586
Hey.

835
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,957
We'll find her.

836
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:20,758
I promise.

837
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:29,801
<i>We'll return in a moment.</i>

838
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:33,962
To a success,

839
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:37,466
Though a narrow escape
for both of you.

840
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,844
<i>It is better.</i>

841
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,514
The old ways always are.

842
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,616
You said you wanted
to destroy the inhumans.

843
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,920
<i>And the thing
that brought them upon us.</i>

844
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,355
It's something I've been after
for a very long time.

845
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,258
Some people say
it's an obsession.

846
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,893
I can relate.

847
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,964
Every time something strange
happens in the world,

848
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,232
It is there.

849
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,568
I believe it is responsible.

850
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,103
For all of the alien problems
on this planet...

851
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,041
The chitauri,
the kree, inhumans.

852
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,375
What is it?

853
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,682
A man.

854
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,754
He is always there...

855
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,625
Standing behind, out of focus...

856
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
In the shadows.

857
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,462
He is dead...

858
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:42,798
Yet he is everywhere.

859
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,168
And mr. Shockley said
he was there last night.

860
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,136
I can assure you...

861
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,173
He's not dead.

862
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,542
You can help me get to him?

863
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,816
So...

864
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,918
Let it be written.

865
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,319
<font color="#ffff00">Captions by vitac</font>...
