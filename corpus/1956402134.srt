1
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:17,894
The following
is based on a true story.

2
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:26,223
Chloe!

3
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:27,221
Come here, Chloe.

4
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:29,305
Come here, Chloe.

5
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:30,569
Hi.

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,403
Hey, listen.

7
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:33,202
You won't get cherry pie
like this in California.

8
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:34,629
Ugh, dad.

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,779
Give her a break, dad.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,209
Hey, what'd I say?

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,809
You're impossible.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,139
She was hired over a
group of a 100 graduates.

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,659
So, she could change her mind.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,610
It's not too late.

15
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,099
Let her go it was just a

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,879
wonderful opportunity you know that.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,429
Oh, okay, Laura, what do I have to do?

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,419
Dad, where did all this come from?

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,869
Come on it's a chance of a lifetime.

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,079
I can't even believe
they offered me the job.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,259
You can get a good job
right here in Virginia.

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,759
Oh, stop.

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,049
The Silicon Valley is the major leagues.

24
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,169
And Kensitron is the best.

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,239
You always told me to go for the best.

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,829
I said that?

27
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,663
Tom.

28
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:11,652
Uh-huh.

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,379
I'm gonna miss you baby.

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,363
I'll miss you too, dad.

31
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:21,767
I'll be all right.

32
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:29,211
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

33
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:30,045
Love you.

34
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,533
Oh, yeah.

35
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,130
Now this is where you'll
be doing most of your work.

36
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,759
Most that is except for when
you're testing your designs

37
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,929
which, of course, you'll
do in a secure area.

38
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,709
Which reminds me I'll have to start

39
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,493
putting you in for security clearance.

40
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:16,327
All right.

41
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:19,029
Now this is gonna be your
work station right here.

42
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,899
You wear your badge above
your waist at all times.

43
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,089
- Okay.
- Now, they're colored coded.

44
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,259
You work your way up to gold,

45
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,564
and this entire toy
store is open up to you.

46
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:27,550
All right.

47
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:28,850
- Chris?
- Yeah, come on.

48
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,359
I think we've done it.

49
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,379
We've got the clock
rate up to 20 megahertz

50
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,823
with no sign of failure.

51
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,049
Excuse me.

52
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,499
I didn't mean to bust in.

53
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,649
No, that's okay.

54
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,259
Rich, this is Laura Black.

55
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,299
Laura is one of our new design engineers.

56
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,599
She's gonna be working
over in signal processing.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,429
Hi, Rich, nice to meet you.

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,263
Hi.

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,479
Well, we were just getting
ready to get a bite to eat.

60
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,989
You wanna come with us?

61
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,349
That sounds good.

62
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,183
Okay.

63
00:04:58,614 --> 00:04:59,899
Yeah, it's great.

64
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,069
Hey, look you like softball?

65
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,903
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

66
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:03,459
WW got a great softball team.

67
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,009
First thing you're gonna learn about KEI

68
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,059
is we're like one big family.

69
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,816
A dysfunctional family.

70
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,589
Anyway, Laura didn't come
to KEI to play softball.

71
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,709
Did you find an apartment yet?

72
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,139
No, I was thinking about sharing.

73
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,739
Well, then you ought
to try to get a hold of

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,869
a copy of our award-winning
company newsletter.

75
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,549
You'll find riveting coverage

76
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,911
of last month's pancake breakfast.

77
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,413
And they have ads for
roommates in the back.

78
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,730
Thanks, I'll check it out.

79
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:48,352
I'll catch up with you guys.

80
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:50,166
- You too.
- Hey.

81
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,719
We are talking serious truck here.

82
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,499
For skiing,
I bought it for the snow.

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,490
You like to ski?

84
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,360
I love skiing.

85
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,209
I hear that just a couple
of hours from where we are

86
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,626
some of the best there is.

87
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:00,460
Yeah.

88
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,820
Have you ever been to a tractor pull?

89
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,179
No, I can't say I have.

90
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,100
I know it sounds weird.

91
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:12,679
But they're really a whole lot of fun.

92
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,079
There's gonna be one on
Saturday at the fairgrounds,

93
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,719
and I just happen to
have a couple of tickets.

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,770
You wanna go with me?

95
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:22,663
Sorry, but I couldn't.

96
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,880
I know we just met.

97
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:26,599
But you'd be in good hands with me.

98
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,759
I have high-level security clearance.

99
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,533
America trusts me, so can you.

100
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,343
Thanks, but I really can't go.

101
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:37,840
Yeah.

102
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:38,990
Alright, ready to go.

103
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:40,811
Okay.

104
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,911
Back to the salt mine.

105
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:54,039
Sauna, gym, jacuzzi,
pool, rec room with wet bar,

106
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,339
half a dozen other amenities

107
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,829
you're probably never gonna use.

108
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,749
So why would you wanna
move to Sunnyvale anyway?

109
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,419
Well, I just graduated UC Davis,

110
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,749
and now I'm working as an engineer at KEI.

111
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,579
- Engineering?
- Uh-huh.

112
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,593
Wow, tell me what was the
ratio of guys to girls there?

113
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,653
I don't know 10 to one.

114
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,169
Incredible I made the
mistake with art history.

115
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,868
12 guys my entire major
half of whom were gay, so.

116
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:18,929
Is that right, huh?

117
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,539
So you're from New York?

118
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,989
You can tell?

119
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,459
I'm from Soho.

120
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,403
I paint.

121
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,193
Why fire escapes?

122
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,889
I happen to like them.

123
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,840
I sold quite a few of those in my time.

124
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,102
Well, that must be quite a leap, huh,

125
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,813
Soho to the Silicon Valley?

126
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,560
Yeah, well, believe it or
not I don't have a trust fund.

127
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,349
So what's your work deal?

128
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,909
Well, my job's got a
three-month probation period.

129
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,339
That's all I can commit
to in terms of rent.

130
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,499
Well, if you can compete
in engineering school

131
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,400
and get a job at KEI, I'll bet on you.

132
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,233
How long is it gonna take
you to get your stuff here?

133
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,700
Can you open this door for me?

134
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:42,899
Oh, thank you.

135
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,119
I'm sorry, I'm new.

136
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,369
I didn't know this door would be locked.

137
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,109
Oh, they open it at eight.

138
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,159
I'm just trying to get in
early to get myself together.

139
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,919
I should've realized everything
around here is security.

140
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,770
I'm Glenda Moritz.

141
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:53,999
I work in accounting.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,890
Nice to meet you.

143
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:56,209
- I'm Laura Black.
- Laura Black.

144
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,709
Yeah, I know. I've got
you right here, welcome.

145
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,799
Well, thanks for letting me in.

146
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,633
If I can do anything for you,

147
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:01,643
- Glenda.
- You can.

148
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,859
- First base?
- Excuse me.

149
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,260
We need a first baseman
for the softball team.

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,340
Deal.

151
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,173
Thanks.

152
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,140
- Rich.
- Smell something good?

153
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,500
How'd you get in?

154
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,660
Fresh baked blueberry
bread made it myself.

155
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,289
Rich, it's seven
o'clock in the morning.

156
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,349
What are you doing here so early?

157
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,609
I couldn't sleep when I can't sleep,

158
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,209
I work on my computer or I bake.

159
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,989
You wanna know my secret?

160
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,289
Lemon zest it brings it all together.

161
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,769
Here, enjoy.

162
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,603

What a surprise.

188
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,059
But you're just the person I wanna see.

189
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,710
Did you find a place to live yet?

190
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,239
Yes, I have.

191
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,017
Great, guess what?

192
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:21,369
- What?
- I got two tickets

193
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,109
for the Temptation's
concert on Sunday night.

194
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,943
You wanna go?

195
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,249
I'm busy on Sunday.

196
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,689
Okay, we'll forget about the concert.

197
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,340
What about dinner Saturday night?

198
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,133
Look, I just really don't
think it's a good idea.

199
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,859
It's gonna be real hard
for us to have a relationship

200
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,810
if you keep refusing to go out with me.

201
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,529
Rich, the only relationship
that we're gonna have

202
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,593
is a professional one in the office.

203
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,989
I don't think it's a good idea to wear

204
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,769
such a sexy looking top in public.

205
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,330
It might give people the wrong impression.

206
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:23,423
Come on!

207
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,931
Come on!

208
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:28,052
Go we need a hit!

209
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:30,289
Alright, alright come on field!

210
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,123
Give us a hit baby!

211
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,779
Okay, Laura, you're up to bat.

212
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,481
Alright, okay.

213
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:37,982
Alright, yeah,
come on now you can do it!

214
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:38,816
Do it.

215
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,193
- Laura.
- What?

216
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,349
Laura, I've been thinking about

217
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,469
the terms of our relationship.

218
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,709
- What?
- I know this isn't

219
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,659
a good time now, but I
thought after the game

220
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,839
maybe we should go out
and discuss it then?

221
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,239
No, Rich.

222
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,119
How do I make myself clear?

223
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,169
We are not having a relationship.

224
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,935
I am not going out with you.

225
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:00,539
What's it
gonna take for you to get it?

226
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,429
You're not gonna use
that aluminum bat are you?

227
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,952
You're never gonna get
a hit with that one.

228
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:06,548
Hey, come on, Laura, play ball.

229
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:07,440
- No, private coach.
- Come on, Laura.

230
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,368
Come on
make us look good, Laura!

231
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:12,608
Laura, You can do it, yeah!

232
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:14,265
You can do it, babe, we're behind you.

233
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:17,393
We're with you, Laura!

234
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:18,227
Strike one.

235
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:21,139
It's not too late to change bats, Laura.

236
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,670
That's okay we're
all right here for you, Laura.

237
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,792
Strike two.

238
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,305
That's the wrong bat for you.

239
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:34,280
I know what I'm talking about.

240
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,843
You should use a wooden one.

241
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:39,253
Give it all you got!

242
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,738
Safe.

243
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:04,346
Way to go, Laura.

244
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:06,029
Alright, now they're two outs,

245
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,493
so just one on anything.

246
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,268
Strike one.

247
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,969
You know, if he's giving you a problem,

248
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,973
you really ought to take
it up with management.

249
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,853
It's okay, Glenda, I can handle him.

250
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,499
Well, you keep
giving him those looks,

251
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,050
and he's not gone bake you
anymore blueberry bread.

252
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,199
That's exactly what I'm hoping for.

253
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,354
- Phyllis.
- Hmm-mm.

254
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:00,188
- Hi.
- Hi.

255
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,339
That new engineering, Chris' group,

256
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,609
Laura Black one of the techs overheard

257
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,839
that she has a birthday coming up,

258
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,759
and we were thinking about
having a little party.

259
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,489
So, could you find me her exact birthday?

260
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,653
Oh, sure.

261
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:12,609
Thank you.

262
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:24,449
There we go.

263
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,679
Looks like your tech overheard wrong.

264
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,280
Her birthday isn't till January.

265
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,483
Well, that's weird.

266
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,055
Thanks anyway, Phyllis.

267
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,473
Sure.

268
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,600
Laura.

269
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,765
This is for you.

270
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:59,068
I don't want your gifts.

271
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:00,249
I don't really care what you want

272
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,734
after the way you were acting yesterday.

273
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:04,299
What are you talking about?

274
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,439
You were making faces at me.

275
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,679
Don't think I didn't see you,

276
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,089
childish, silly, faces,

277
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,599
and that's why you're getting this.

278
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,879
Go on open it.

279
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,780
I'm not gonna leave until you open it.

280
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,029
If you're gonna act like a child,

281
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm gonna have to treat you like a child.

282
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,449
Here's a letter.

283
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,283
Read it.

284
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,119
So, until I can ask you out nicely

285
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,749
and have you say yes, I'll be around.

286
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,969
I promise.

287
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,299
If you really wanna get rid of me,

288
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,579
you're gonna have to bite the bullet

289
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,899
and let me take you out a few times.

290
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,199
If we just argue and fight,

291
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,950
then I'll leave you alone for good.

292
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,069
What are you gonna do
about this guy, Laura?

293
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,739
Well, I'm not inviting
him to the company picnic

294
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,459
if that's what you mean.

295
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,839
Earth to, Laura.

296
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,879
This a man on the edge.

297
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,133
You gotta tell your boss.

298
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,499
I work with 60 guys.

299
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,739
I am the only woman in my department.

300
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,139
There are people just waiting for me

301
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,330
to pick up my dolls and go home.

302
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,629
I've always done things on my own.

303
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,793
I can handle this guy.

304
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,769
What are you gonna do sit him down

305
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,730
and have a chat with him?

306
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:29,953
I mean, this is not a person
that you can reason with.

307
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,759
I refuse to be his victim.

308
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,460
I'm not gonna give him that power.

309
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,950
You don't get it.

310
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:41,649
Anything you say to a guy
like this is like trouble.

311
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,009
I mean, you can't even
make eye contact with him.

312
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,163
Do you like tofu?

313
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,799
Hmm?

314
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,849
Laura, this is like trying to talk

315
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,250
to the geniuses I work with.

316
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,263
I'm serious what are you gonna do?

317
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,029
I'm gonna toss the tofu in the salad,

318
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,630
and we are going to have dinner.

319
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:08,186
I couldn't believe
it this is supposed to be like

320
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,596
the number one team in the league, right?

321
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:12,432
Their third baseman, my god,
it was like he was asleep.

322
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:13,909
What about the pitcher though?

323
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,252
I mean, he tried to but to
the back and his slow pitch.

324
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:18,086
- I know.
- But you know what

325
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:19,129
it was the infield.

326
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,349
The infield was cooking.

327
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,349
That's it defense is
the name of the game.

328
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,183
All the way.

329
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:25,226
I think your offense
overwhelmed them too, Laura.

330
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:27,263
What were you four for five?

331
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,034
Can I have a refill, Glenda?

332
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,099
Thank you.

333
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,970
Anybody, hungry?

334
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,407
Let's put an order in.

335
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:34,953
- Yes, yes.
- I'm starving.

336
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,299
I'll have a number 24 please.

337
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,589
Number 26, the turkey and
ham with cheese, is their best.

338
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,769
Right, okay,
anything for anybody else?

339
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,779
I'll have a number 29.

340
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,229
Thank you.

341
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,319
Ooh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

342
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,563
Okay, everybody got some.

343
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,426
To us.

344
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,941
And people like us.

345
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,743
Whoo!

346
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:02,889
- All right.
- Say it again.

347
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,290
Now we gotta keep this up.

348
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,529
Right I'll believe it when I see it.

349
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,566
No problem.

350
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,029
$300 for an alternator
and a new battery.

351
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,839
What is an alternator anyway?

352
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,939
Well, the alternator
powers the electrical system.

353
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,959
It recharges the battery.

354
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,272
- So if you don't have...
- Give me subways.

355
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:20,619
Give me taxis.

356
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,453
Give me buses.

357
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:23,898
I mean $300 is a lot of cab fare.

358
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,843
Oh, my god.

359
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,786
See you there.

360
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,189
I spoke to Chris a while ago.

361
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,019
He told me you were
gonna be late on account

362
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,609
of somebody slashed your tires last night.

363
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,679
That's terrible, Laura.

364
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,989
- I feel awful.
- Yeah, I bet you do, Rich.

365
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,299
Well, you must live in
a dangerous neighborhood.

366
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,399
Either that, or someone's trying
to make you pay attention.

367
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,999
Nobody makes me do
anything I don't want to.

368
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,699
I called the police and
they're investigating.

369
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,259
Without any witnesses there's
really not much they can do.

370
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,560
Didn't they tell you that?

371
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,730
They advised me to get a
restraining order against you.

372
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,319
Listen, Laura, I don't ever

373
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,019
wanna see any cops around me.

374
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,652
Things would just get out of hand.

375
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:44,949
It would be a mistake.

376
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,539
So have you given any thought

377
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,029
to how you're gonna replace your tires?

378
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,419
Pep Boys is having a sale.

379
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,549
I could go with you to pick them out.

380
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,750
You could put them on
my charge if you want.

381
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,057
You think about it.

382
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,058
Let me know.

383
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,329
Laura, we all know engineers
can be a bit eccentric.

384
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,439
But Richard Farley is one of the most

385
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,079
highly regarded employees we have.

386
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,463
He's been here for over nine years.

387
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,509
Have you had a relationship
with him outside KEI?

388
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,753
No, of course not.

389
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,699
One night he was waiting
outside my aerobics class,

390
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,519
and then again he showed
up at my apartment

391
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,663
and gave me a gift.

392
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,060
What sort of a gift?

393
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,269
It was a toy.

394
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,229
He said it was because
I was acting childish

395
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,979
at the company softball
game by making faces at him.

396
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,753
Did you make faces at him?

397
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,249
I don't know he was annoying me.

398
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,929
Yeah, maybe I made faces at him, so what?

399
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,119
And that was the only contact

400
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,539
you had with him outside of work?

401
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,373
Yes.

402
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,489
Except I did have lunch
with him my first day here.

403
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,323
But that's all.

404
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,763
Look it wasn't a date.

405
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,629
Chris, my supervisor asked
me if I wanted to go to lunch

406
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,949
and Farley happened to be
there, so he came along.

407
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,650
Everybody paid for their own meal.

408
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,199
It was my first day.

409
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,583
I had just met him.

410
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,303
What?

411
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,740
Do you always smile at people that way?

412
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,596
Left side and one.

413
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:41,289
Two.

414
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,665
Three.

415
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,205
Four.

416
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:45,740
Five.

417
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,227
Six.

418
00:22:47,228 --> 00:22:48,859
Seven.

419
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,693
Eight.

420
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:51,430
She's the best instructor around here.

421
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,140
You are not supposed to be in here.

422
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,019
Penny had a talk with me.

423
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,099
She told me to stay away from you at work.

424
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,670
But they can't tell me
what to do on my own time.

425
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:07,821
♪ I've been waiting for someone
just like you to keep me ♪

426
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,023
♪ Captured ♪

427
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,221
♪ Captured ♪

428
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,880
♪ Captured taken in ♪

429
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:20,513
Rich.

430
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,029
This is gonna be fabulous.

431
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,538
Well, you wanted closet space,

432
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,509
and closest space is
what you're gonna get.

433
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,199
You're the best.

434
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,379
Tenant of the year.

435
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,643
I was tearing out the old
closest and look what I found.

436
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,173
I thought I lost these.

437
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,519
I was thinking maybe you and Laura and I

438
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,689
could go to Tahoe this year.

439
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,040
She loves to ski, you know.

440
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,583
Yeah, sure.

441
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,629
Rich, I know you have a thing for Laura.

442
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,879
It's no secret.

443
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,423
The whole company knows.

444
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,379
Can I give you some advice?

445
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,823
She's not interested.

446
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,330
Why do you wanna force this?

447
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,629
Hi, Love.

448
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,500
It's 2:30 a.m.,

449
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:46,159
and I'm writing you this.

450
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,063
That means that I'm bored and can't sleep.

451
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,743
I've been awake thinking
for the last two hours.

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,650
I watched you a little on Friday.

453
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,893
Oh, god, you're lovely.

454
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,223
I love it when you try to ignore
me because there's no way.

455
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,839
You're just as aware of me when I'm around

456
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,543
as I am of you when you're around.

457
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,570
Would you believe that I
really hate upsetting you?

458
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,093
So, I think, I'll start by apologizing.

459
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,519
Sometimes I admit I think of you sexually.

460
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,699
But I spend a lot more
time trying to understand

461
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,549
what you say, what you do,

462
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,929
why you won't do things with me.

463
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,529
I've been told over and over again

464
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,893
I should stop wasting my time with you.

465
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,480
They just don't understand
the hold you have on me.

466
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:53,285
Hey, Laura.

467
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,386
I bet you get gas mileage with this.

468
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:01,239
You know, I'm feeling kind of hungry,

469
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,499
and I was wondering if maybe you wanted

470
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,983
to go out and have a bite right now?

471
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:07,939
I'm tired and I wish you'd
please just leave me alone.

472
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,789
If we could just talk about this.

473
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,409
I don't feel like
talking about anything.

474
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,959
I just want you to stop bothering me.

475
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,129
She's my girlfriend!

476
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,479
I am not his girlfriend!

477
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,629
She gets like this sometimes.

478
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,520
She's got quite a temper.

479
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,949
But it doesn't mean anything at all.

480
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,293
Just a lover's quarrel.

481
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:22,250
You know how it is.

482
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:23,600
Laura, where are you going?

483
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:25,406
I just wanna talk!

484
00:26:51,197 --> 00:26:52,308
What?

485
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,360
I can't stay here anymore.

486
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,459
We'll get a new apartment something with

487
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,949
really great security.

488
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,209
No, this is my problem.

489
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,679
I can't do this to you.

490
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,573
I've gotta move.

491
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:16,459
What and leave me alone with this guy.

492
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,043
I'm moving with you, okay?

493
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,129
There's something about iron gates

494
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,369
I've really come to like.

495
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,029
It's sort of like fire escapes.

496
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,939
This is either the most
secure apartment complex

497
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,452
or the fanciest prison.

498
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,469
Rich, could I interest
you in some anchovy pizza?

499
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,823
Oh, no, thanks very much.

500
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,469
Rich, I don't want guns in the house.

501
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,259
I told you that when you rented the place.

502
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,719
They're not loaded.

503
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,363
I don't care my daughter
has her friends over.

504
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,099
I want them out of here.

505
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,163
I mean it, Rich!

506
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,389
I'll take care of it.

507
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,223
When?

508
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,133
I wanna know, Rich!

509
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,430
I said I'd take care of it, Nancy.

510
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,063
Goodnight, Chris.

511
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,839
Is it six o'clock already?

512
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,839
No, I had to adjust my
hours, so I could leave early

513
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,653
and avoid certain people, remember?

514
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,863
Right.

515
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,059
Listen, Laura, about that application

516
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,889
for the level five security clearance

517
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,829
when do I get that back?

518
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,589
I am working on it, but it is torture.

519
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,553
They wanna know everything.

520
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,599
Hey, when you work for Defense,

521
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,089
big brother has to know
everything about you.

522
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,959
So you get through with that, right?

523
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,979
Because you're not
going to get a promotion

524
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,330
without a clearance ticket.

525
00:29:42,168 --> 00:29:43,259
I'll get it done.

526
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,118
Alright, thanks.

527
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:47,035
- Alright, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

528
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,659
New apartment's must
nicer, more private,

529
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,079
but I'll bet you pay a lot more too.

530
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,109
I'm calling the police.

531
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,983
I don't think that's a good idea.

532
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,989
You know the holidays are
just around the corner,

533
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,290
and you haven't even
sent me a Christmas card.

534
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,259
How long did you think it would take

535
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,410
before I found out
where your new place is?

536
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,193
Are your two sisters as sneaky as you are?

537
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,939
Your little sister
Sarah is at Oregon State

538
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,219
and your older sister Bonnie

539
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,559
is a nurse in Newport Beach, right?

540
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,099
Oh, my god.

541
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,169
I even know about the time

542
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,889
that you tried marijuana in high school,

543
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,209
and if we're gonna have a relationship,

544
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,669
you're gonna have to promise me right now

545
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,709
that you will never do drugs again.

546
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,619
Stop it, stop it.

547
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,370
If you try to run, I'll go
after one of your sisters.

548
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,800
Maybe even your mother.

549
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:10,755
What is it?

550
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,932
How far are you gonna push this?

551
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,219
What do you want?

552
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,193
You wanna kill me?

553
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,203
You wanna rape me?

554
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,013
You and I were meant
for each other, Laura.

555
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:22,847
Why me?

556
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:24,929
Just tell me why me?

557
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,663
All I know is you and I were
meant to be together forever.

558
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:33,981
You're sick, you're sick.

559
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:09,585
♪ Gloria ♪

560
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,062
♪ Hosanna ♪

561
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:17,905
Oh, no.

562
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:19,379
That's the one grandma made for you.

563
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,619
I'll clean it up.

564
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,239
Hey, maybe it can be glued?

565
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,539
Well, it can't.

566
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,790
Why are you making such
a big deal out of it?

567
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,686
What's your problem?

568
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,639
Package for you, Laura.

569
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,723
It's from California.

570
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,880
You have a boyfriend
you haven't told us about?

571
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,073
No, I don't.

572
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:06,362
Oh, god.

573
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:14,594
No.

574
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,779
I've complained for six months now.

575
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,143
They just don't hear me.

576
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,339
Sometimes I get the feeling they think

577
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,943
I'm responsible somehow.

578
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,826
The woman in personnel
said, "Maybe this happened

579
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:37,079
"because I smiled at him too much."

580
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,069
This is ridiculous.

581
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,909
Look maybe I should go out there.

582
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,883
Dad, that's the last thing I want.

583
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,619
Laura, you're a talented girl.

584
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,319
You could go to work someplace else.

585
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,240
I can't do that.

586
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,529
Why?

587
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,749
You know I have worked
hard all my life to get this.

588
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,019
I'm doing everything
I've always dreamed off.

589
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,923
I like it.

590
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,163
I can't change my life because of him.

591
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,989
If I do that, I'm his victim.

592
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,173
It's like he's won.

593
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,173
I'll go back to them, dad.

594
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,003
I'll make them listen to me.

595
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,873
I promise.

596
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,179
We're trying to do
something about this Laura.

597
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,053
It's a complex situation.

598
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,229
You've got his letters.

599
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,339
You've got witnesses.

600
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,440
What more do you need?

601
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,753
Look it's getting in
the way of doing my job.

602
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,279
We don't wanna jeopardize
Richard's security clearance.

603
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,253
I can restrict his access
to keep him away from you,

604
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,399
and we can offer counseling to him

605
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,253
in a program called Project Concern.

606
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,409
Project Concern he won't go.

607
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,103
He'll either go on be fired.

608
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,773
It's something I'd like to
make available to you too.

609
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,599
I don't counseling.

610
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,923
All I need is for him to leave me alone.

611
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,813
I understand.

612
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,419
Does he still follow you
to your aerobics class?

613
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,249
All the time, he's a member now.

614
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,399
You might think about
giving it up for a while.

615
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,923
- It creates...
- Creates what?

616
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,623
An awkward situation.

617
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,769
You know.

618
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,693
The clothes.

619
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,159
You don't get it, lady!

620
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,553
The problem here is Richard Farley not me!

621
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,819
- Check it out.
- Isn't he cute.

622
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,722
Oh, my the smile.

623
00:37:56,723 --> 00:37:57,913
Look at that.

624
00:37:57,914 --> 00:37:58,999
I don't know.

625
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,840
He's adorable.

626
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,690
He's new to me.

627
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,700
Sure, okay.

628
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:04,753
- All right.
- Bye.

629
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,019
Here we go.

630
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,722
Alright, Laura, give it up.

631
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:12,119
Give it up talk we want details.

632
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,953
What?

633
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:16,169
- Come on he's adorable.
- Who is he?

634
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,289
- What's the deal?
- Okay, okay.

635
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,513
His name is Sam Waters and
he's in systems with Fairchild.

636
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,923
And did he ask you out?

637
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:26,759
Oh, maybe.

638
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,727
Come on we want the details.

639
00:38:28,728 --> 00:38:29,772
What's the story?

640
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:31,849
Well, I don't really
know too much about him.

641
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,850
But he grew up on a ranch in
Montana and he's into rodeo.

642
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,312
Well, he can come and play
in my corral anytime he wants.

643
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,023
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

644
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,974
Excuse me, I can't take you anywhere.

645
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,799
I spent the whole
day at Project Concern,

646
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,559
and I have no intention of
ever going back there again.

647
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,689
You and Penny and Chris you have no idea

648
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,290
of who you're messing with here.

649
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,893
Go get the manager now!

650
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,537
I want you to get out of my way.

651
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:11,569
You think I'm a joke, don't you?

652
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,049
No, Rich, I don't you're a joke.

653
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,469
Don't you understand

654
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,259
why do you wanna find
out how far I will go?

655
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,849
Is it because you wanna be right and win?

656
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,729
Is that you wanna tell
everybody that you won?

657
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,379
No, it's not about winning.

658
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,539
I just wanna be left alone.

659
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,759
I just don't think that
you should tell anybody

660
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,129
about our little talk here, alright?

661
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,539
They might get the wrong impression,

662
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,949
and then they would do something stupid

663
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,479
and then I could do something stupid.

664
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,749
And the whole thing could
spiral beyond hope of recovery.

665
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,280
Get out of here!

666
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,450
This could escalate, Laura.

667
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,313
I might scare us both with
what I'm capable of doing.

668
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,729
I'm not sure you fully comprehend

669
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,433
the seriousness of this matter.

670
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,609
I don't think it's right for you

671
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,173
or anyone else to control
my private relationships.

672
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,309
Do you understand that sexual harassment

673
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,699
is against the law?

674
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,753
You could be fired.

675
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,283
I worked here for over nine years.

676
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,069
If I lost my job, I'd
have nothing to live for.

677
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,970
That's my point.

678
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,563
We want you to stay.

679
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,313
I have guns.

680
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,850
I'd kill myself.

681
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,410
I wouldn't be the only one.

682
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,173
Others would go.

683
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,343
Rich, are you saying if you were fired,

684
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,463
you would kill me?

685
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,663
Yes.

686
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,623
Not just you I'd take others as well.

687
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,593
Excuse me.

688
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:15,144
Laura.

689
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,979
Richard Farley has been terminated

690
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,713
by the company effective today.

691
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,889
When did all this happen?

692
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:41,933
Late last night.

693
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,053
Laura, do you have a place
to go for the weekend?

694
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:49,810
What do you mean?

695
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:52,509
Why don't you go
a way for a couple of days?

696
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,159
You can leave right now,
and why don't you charge

697
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,143
the rest of the afternoon to the company.

698
00:42:00,783 --> 00:42:02,430
Let me have a diet Cola.

699
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,184
Hey, Farley.

700
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:07,179
What you doing playing hooky?

701
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,486
Nope.

702
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:09,363
I just got fired.

703
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,363
So did Mike here.

704
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,549
Well, sit down.

705
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,563
Join the club.

706
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,120
I'll tell you something

707
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,799
that company is going to hell.

708
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,419
I put in six years, busted
my hump for that company.

709
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,253
Doesn't make any difference.

710
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:27,869
They got no loyalty.

711
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,829
I was there nine years,
and how did they thank me?

712
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,483
Terminated, no notice, no appeal.

713
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,679
Just like that I'm gone.

714
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,149
What's it gonna take to wake them up?

715
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,489
Somebody should do something.

716
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,723
Make them pay attention.

717
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,573
Yep, somebody ought
to teach them a lesson.

718
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,299
Hell, they're not gonna listen.

719
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,459
We're last year's model.

720
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,360
What do they care.

721
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,989
Larry, you work upfront.

722
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,349
Those Mardex doors are
they bulletproof glass?

723
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,250
No, they're not.

724
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:05,549
What about the doors between the offices

725
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,033
are they solid or hallow?

726
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,269
Well, they're hallow, why?

727
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,183
Rich, what are you talking about?

728
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,293
I'll see you guys later.

729
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,120
Wait, what are you gonna do?

730
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,737
I mean, now that you're
free and everything?

731
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:32,988
I don't know.

732
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:36,684
I'll think of something.

733
00:43:58,885 --> 00:43:59,802
Hey, Laura.

734
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:02,099
Laura, I'm a free man now.

735
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,589
KEI can't tell me what to do anymore,

736
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,353
so what do you say we start fresh?

737
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,429
I'll tell you what I got
some errands to run now,

738
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,763
but I'll be back and
take you to lunch, okay?

739
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,459
Richard Farley is no longer
an employee of the company.

740
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,359
What about the company
getting a restraining order?

741
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,589
A restraining order is something

742
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,229
you should feel free
to pursue on your own.

743
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,769
But the company's not going to pay for it.

744
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,339
We are no longer involved.

745
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,619
But he was fired for sexual harassment.

746
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,189
No, he wasn't.

747
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,833
He was let because the
quality of his work fell off.

748
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,123
We thought it would be better that way.

749
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,759
Better?

750
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,763
Better for whom?

751
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,249
You may already have
won a million dollars.

752
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,649
I don't think so.

753
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,269
Ooh, two free toppings on
a pizza I'll keep that.

754
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,559
Free carpet cleaning coupons.

755
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,637
And a letter from you know who.

756
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,433
Dear Laura, thank you
for getting me fired.

757
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,879
It's probably the best thing
that ever happened to me.

758
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,610
The neutral references from KEI

759
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,009
helped me land a job
as a software engineer

760
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,559
with Prototrends in Cupertino.

761
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,819
Complete with stock
options and full benefits.

762
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,479
I put you down as the beneficiary

763
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,053
of my life insurance policy.

764
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,919
I'm also taking classes at San Jose State.

765
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,629
Got a 92 on my first calc test.

766
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,729
Now it's onto linear combinations,

767
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:47,480
augmented matrices and other
pleasures of linear algebra.

768
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,629
I moved out of Nancy's house

769
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,499
to my own place two months ago.

770
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,669
The rent is only $450 a month,

771
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,619
but I do all the repairs.

772
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,329
I'm fixing up a guest room.

773
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,124
You're welcome to stay anytime you like.

774
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,463
Do you know what really
worries me about loving you?

775
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:09,480
I keep wondering

776
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,110
would I lose interest

777
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,763
if you weren't so difficult?

778
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,769
Thing about going to a lawyer

779
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,739
for a restraining order
is it could get expensive.

780
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,509
I wouldn't mind if I was
sure it would do some good.

781
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,479
But even if he violates
the restraining order,

782
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,719
all they're gonna do is
slap him on the wrist.

783
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,933
Yeah, just enough to provoke him.

784
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:47,966
How do you live with this, Laura?

785
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,982
Well, at least it's let up.

786
00:46:50,983 --> 00:46:53,639
I mean, he's pretty much
left me alone lately.

787
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,473
I still...

788
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,133
Thank you.

789
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,283
It's alright, Sam.

790
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,253
Believe me, I've learned
to live with this.

791
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,299
Laura, listen to me.

792
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,663
You have got to take this more seriously.

793
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:47,043
Now it goes in just like that.

794
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,073
Now you try it.

795
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:57,324
Like that?

796
00:47:57,325 --> 00:47:59,339
That's it you got it.

797
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,419
Now remember you shoot him.

798
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,912
You wanna empty the gun, all nine shots.

799
00:48:04,913 --> 00:48:06,550
I couldn't.

800
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:07,968
Yes, you could.

801
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,609
There's not a court in the
world that would convict you

802
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,460
if you shot him on your own property.

803
00:48:15,164 --> 00:48:16,179
I don't like this.

804
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,293
I can't even believe
we're talking about it.

805
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,253
All right.

806
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,539
Let's just leave this here,

807
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,929
and if it really bothers you,

808
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,363
I promise I'll come pick it up.

809
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,533
Okay?

810
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:37,691
Come on.

811
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:38,692
All right.

812
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,530
Thanks, Sam, goodnight.

813
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,653
Be careful.

814
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,769
I'm just a phone call away if you need me.

815
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,333
Alright, thanks.

816
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:48,939
Oh, did I wake you up. I'm really sorry.

817
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,890
I just wanted to be sure

818
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:51,968
that you got this note in the morning.

819
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:55,009
How did you get in here?

820
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,903
There you go with that attitude.

821
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,149
This could be so easy, Laura.

822
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,509
If you would just make up your mind

823
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,539
to go home dinner with me occasionally,

824
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,469
then I wouldn't have to go
sneaking into your garage

825
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,699
to leave notes on your car.

826
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,083
It's really not that hard.

827
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,793
This isn't gonna end, is it?

828
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,739
That's the point I'm trying to make.

829
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,440
The next move is up to you, Laura.

830
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,189
As soon as KEI cashes
out my retirement fund,

831
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,406
I'm gonna buy investment property,

832
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:26,619
and I was hoping that you
would go partners with me.

833
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,609
It's all there in the letter.

834
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,510
I'm gonna let you get back to bed now.

835
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,873
Oh, could you send me the
new softball schedule?

836
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:39,903
Thanks.

837
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:07,025
Thanks.

838
00:51:07,026 --> 00:51:07,966
Alright, take care.

839
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:08,899
- You got it.
- Good to see you.

840
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:25,403
Well?

841
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,103
Oh, um.

842
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,480
I like it.

843
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:31,109
I think, that you're
ready for pattern matching

844
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:31,943
and a test run.

845
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,753
Chris, don't do this to me.

846
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,299
What did they say?

847
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,899
Nothing really we
discussed corporate planning,

848
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,993
and they approved your promotion.

849
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,783
Senior project analyst.

850
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,729
There's only one hitch, Laura.

851
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,869
Your level five security
clearances haven't come through.

852
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,589
Now you know that you
need the clearance tickets

853
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,319
to get the promotion, right?

854
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,259
They're only gonna wait
for so long, Laura.

855
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,639
I worked hard for this, Chris.

856
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,909
I know.

857
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,849
Listen, I think it's because
Farley's still following you

858
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,183
and screwing things up.

859
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,420
Why don't you walk to a lawyer, Laura.

860
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:11,963
Get the restraining order.

861
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,979
Richard Farley?

862
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,782
Are you the guy from
digital? I'm glad to see you.

863
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,713
No, I have a legal document for you.

864
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,849
This is a temporary restraining order.

865
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:47,159
Laura wouldn't do that to me.

866
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,010
She can, and she did, pal.

867
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,769
Court date is set for Thursday morning.

868
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,020
Wear something conservative
judges like that.

869
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,250
It's not the judge I'm worried about.

870
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,109
Laura, I've seen it
happen time and again

871
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,519
with guys like Farley.

872
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,770
You won't hear from him
again after Thursday.

873
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,913
Right.

874
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,529
I'll be there.

875
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,843
Yeah, thanks.

876
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,459
Court date's this week to make

877
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,119
the restraining order permanent.

878
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,309
Good.

879
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,809
You did the right thing Laura.

880
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,453
You didn't have any choice.

881
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,756
Ooh, hurry sign this.

882
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:31,823
Here they come.

883
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,499
Anniversary?

884
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,389
Yeah, they'll be
married a year on Sunday.

885
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:39,690
We're having a cake later.

886
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,659
- Hi.
- Hi, Wayne.

887
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,003
What's going on?

888
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:45,837
Uh, nothing.

889
00:53:45,837 --> 00:53:46,670
Nothing.

890
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,573
Man, I bet this baby's
great off the road.

891
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,489
You know, I really like it, Rich.

892
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,699
I just can't afford it.

893
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,149
Man, one of these days.

894
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,803
I'm talking about right now.

895
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,169
I just don't have that kind of money.

896
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,406
Look, Gary, two years
ago I paid 18 for it,

897
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:14,963
and I'm gonna let you have it for 4500.

898
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:17,819
It's worth twice that much.

899
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,239
I know that, but something came up,

900
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,290
and I need the money.

901
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,729
Are you sure about this?

902
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,913
Yeah, the only condition
is it's got be cash.

903
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,353
Sure.

904
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,839
Hi, velocity that's what
you're buying with this baby.

905
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,809
She's the best there is, hands down.

906
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,639
- Smooth action?
- Oh, you bet.

907
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,249
And it doesn't have much of a recoil.

908
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,709
That's important for rapid firing.

909
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,999
It is the most expensive one we have.

910
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,885
There are others that are quite good.

911
00:54:52,886 --> 00:54:54,109
You get what you pay for.

912
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,839
- I'll take it.
- Great.

913
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,750
Anything else?

914
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,249
We're having a store wide clearance sale.

915
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,473
Prices you can't beat.

916
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,503
Yes, as a matter of fact there is.

917
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,849
Which one of these ammo vests
down here holds the most?

918
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,209
The one on the right there.

919
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,809
It's got the most pockets.

920
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,109
Alright, I'll take it.

921
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,399
Anything else?

922
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,829
Yeah, let me have two of
these double-aught buck shells.

923
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:18,750
Two boxes.

924
00:55:18,751 --> 00:55:20,113
No, two cases.

925
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,263
That's over 2,000 rounds.

926
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,550
Like you said you
can't beat these prices.

927
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,120
I got one over here.
I think, you'll like it.

928
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,429
I think, this one would
be perfect for you.

929
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,773
You'll cruise down to
Los Angeles in style.

930
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:54,139
Queen sized bed, kitchen, color TV.

931
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,989
What I like is it's got a lot of room.

932
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:57,897
How many people you say you wanted it for?

933
00:55:57,898 --> 00:56:00,960
It'd just be for me and my wife Laura.

934
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,110
She'll be impressed with this.

935
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,228
I'm going on a cookie run.

936
00:56:51,229 --> 00:56:53,509
Can you get you anything?

937
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,067
No, thank you.

938
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:13,533
Hi, dad.

939
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,339
Hey, this is a nice surprise.

940
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,873
I was thinking about you.

941
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:20,913
Too bad mom is out.

942
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,843
How's everything going, Sweetheart?

943
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:28,714
It's all right.

944
00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:31,134
I'm finally going to court tomorrow.

945
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:48,952
Listen are you okay with this?

946
00:57:48,953 --> 00:57:51,609
I could still fly out there, you know.

947
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,499
No, no, it'll be all right.

948
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,950
I just wish I could have
this over and done with.

949
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,729
Tell mom I'm sorry I missed her.

950
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,169
I will.

951
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,820
Listen you take care of yourself.

952
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,350
I love you dad.

953
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,020
I love you too.

954
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:11,072
Hi, Larry.

955
01:00:11,073 --> 01:00:12,990
You can't be serious.

956
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:15,733
Hey, Larry.

957
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:20,528
Cowboys and Indians.

958
01:00:59,381 --> 01:01:01,277
Somebody call security.

959
01:01:01,278 --> 01:01:02,893
A shooter in the south lobby.

960
01:01:02,894 --> 01:01:03,848
Get someone down here quick.

961
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:04,922
Call the cops.

962
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,358
Get down to the south lobby.

963
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,134
Get me some security down here.

964
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,128
Get some guns or something.

965
01:01:12,129 --> 01:01:15,066
Call the cops this guys got a gun.

966
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:16,731
Hurry now.

967
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:48,990
Oh, Ron.

968
01:01:54,184 --> 01:01:55,017
No.

969
01:01:55,017 --> 01:01:55,850
No!

970
01:01:58,553 --> 01:02:00,470
Was that a back fire?

971
01:02:27,413 --> 01:02:30,025
That's it, come on go!

972
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,439
Oh, god.

973
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,370
Oh, no, please don't!

974
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:08,203
Please no!

975
01:04:04,368 --> 01:04:05,201
Rich.

976
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:30,631
- Help me.
- Don't go that way.

977
01:04:30,632 --> 01:04:31,465
Come on.

978
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,247
I need both entrances to
the parking lot sealed off.

979
01:05:05,248 --> 01:05:07,079
Move quickly away from the windows.

980
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,709
Keep moving.

981
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,389
Take cover behind your cars.

982
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:11,939
We have shots fired.

983
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,329
Take cover.

984
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:14,250
Do we know who the shooter is yet?

985
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,141
No, Captain.

986
01:05:15,142 --> 01:05:16,829
We don't know if we're
dealing with a lone gunman

987
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:17,663
or a bunch of terrorists.

988
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,569
SWAT team's on the way.

989
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:20,403
What's he doing?

990
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:25,060
Do not enter the building.

991
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:27,309
I repeat do not enter the building.

992
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:28,335
Get him back.

993
01:05:28,336 --> 01:05:30,419
Stop that man!

994
01:05:52,692 --> 01:05:54,518
Here, come on.

995
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:55,352
Shh, shh.

996
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:34,159
No.

997
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:38,861
No, god.

998
01:06:38,862 --> 01:06:41,948
Please don't let me die in here.

999
01:06:41,949 --> 01:06:42,782
Please.

1000
01:07:25,366 --> 01:07:26,199
Oh, god.

1001
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,889
- Captain Olson?
- Yes.

1002
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:12,709
- Tom Bannister.
- Banister.

1003
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:15,626
Our command post is on
the second floor here.

1004
01:08:15,627 --> 01:08:17,677
Our shooter is on the second floor there.

1005
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:02,650
Captain.

1006
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,859
We have a positive ID on the subject.

1007
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,799
Richard Farley.

1008
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,223
Evidently this might be
about a female employee.

1009
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,219
Laura Black who works in the building.

1010
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,869
And she is?

1011
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,723
As far as we know, still in there.

1012
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:20,759
He's on the second floor

1013
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,279
somewhere between here and there?

1014
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,113
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1015
01:09:25,114 --> 01:09:26,839
How many employees are
still in the building?

1016
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,299
It's still a guess,
but we think the number

1017
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,383
is somewhere between 30 and 50.

1018
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,793
Captain.

1019
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,379
Lieutenant Grijalva hostage negotiator.

1020
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,709
They have an area
set up for you right on

1021
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:41,208
the other side of that glass wall, okay?

1022
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:08,440
Where are you, Laura?

1023
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,670
Oh, no.

1024
01:10:26,671 --> 01:10:27,504
Glenda.

1025
01:10:31,512 --> 01:10:32,345
No.

1026
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:41,463
Here's our boy.

1027
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,800
I've also got his military history.

1028
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,879
Let's make sure every
man on the SWAT team

1029
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,023
has one of these.

1030
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,629
11 years in the Navy,

1031
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:55,379
honorable discharge,
top security clearance,

1032
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,980
no criminal record or history
of any mental illness.

1033
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:00,170
Until today.

1034
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:01,270
He make any demands?

1035
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:03,209
They don't know.

1036
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,043
Captain, we got him on the phone.

1037
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:10,519
I just wanna make sure I'm
talking to the right person.

1038
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,620
Yeah, I'm the guy who's shooting people.

1039
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,359
As a hostage negotiator,
my goal is to help

1040
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,809
get you out of a difficult
situation safely.

1041
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,529
I'm not ready to come out.

1042
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,173
I wanna gloat for a while.

1043
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:28,193
And you can tell them all
this is about Laura Black.

1044
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:30,563
About what?

1045
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:34,849
Tell her
lawyer, and her buddy Chris,

1046
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:37,009
they gave her bad advice.

1047
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:39,716
Are there a lot of
people hurt up there, Rich?

1048
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,769
I'm gonna tell you something right now.

1049
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:46,549
I don't wanna see any
cops sneaking up on me.

1050
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:47,993
I've got an arsenal up here.

1051
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,450
What sort of weapons do you have?

1052
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,309
That's all.

1053
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,319
I'm not saying anymore now.

1054
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,879
You're a
hunter, aren't you, Rich?

1055
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,873
That's why you know so
much about guns, huh?

1056
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,483
I'd rather kill people than animals.

1057
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,370
It's not sporting to kill animals.

1058
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:25,443
Laura.

1059
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:29,019
Oh, my god.

1060
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,709
Who's doing this?

1061
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:31,710
Farley.

1062
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:33,110
We've gotta get out of here.

1063
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,263
Look.

1064
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:37,789
Well, we have to do something.

1065
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:39,359
We gotta stop this bleeding.

1066
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,389
Take this.

1067
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,223
Wait a minute.

1068
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,440
Please, please, please just take them.

1069
01:12:45,765 --> 01:12:46,959
- It's okay.
- Let me get this around.

1070
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,280
You take this.

1071
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,369
Oh, darling.

1072
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,679
Sorry.

1073
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,693
No, come on I got to do this.

1074
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,009
If we assault the
building simultaneously

1075
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:00,969
with SWAT teams here, here, and here,

1076
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:01,803
we can take him.

1077
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,619
Look, there's still a
lot of people inside.

1078
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,279
Some are wounded and
need medical attention.

1079
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,113
I know.

1080
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:14,937
But the price of storming that building

1081
01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:18,743
I can't live with that
at least not right now.

1082
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,883
What if we get Farley
in front of a window?

1083
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,979
Then you have a green light.

1084
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:30,813
Take him out.

1085
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,129
Are we sure these are all the office

1086
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,809
phone numbers on the second floor?

1087
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:30,899
I'll double check.

1088
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,463
We're set up to have all
outgoing calls come to us.

1089
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,133
Hello.

1090
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:51,649
Yeah, is this Rich?

1091
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:53,819
We heard a gunshot in
there is everything okay?

1092
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,869
Who are you trying to kid?

1093
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,459
You're just trying to lock in my position,

1094
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,963
so you can blow me away.

1095
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:05,073
Sorry, sir, he
wasn't on the line long enough.

1096
01:15:11,973 --> 01:15:14,339
Hey, we can put that
cabinet in front of the door.

1097
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,953
No, we stay right here and be quiet.

1098
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,610
No, no, no.

1099
01:15:19,611 --> 01:15:20,543
No, I can't.

1100
01:15:20,544 --> 01:15:23,179
I can't just stay here and
wait for him to get me.

1101
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,880
No, Laura, you can't go out there.

1102
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:26,298
Shh, Laura, no.

1103
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,359
I will not die in here.

1104
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,363
- No.
- No.

1105
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:14,720
Security.

1106
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:18,099
I need you to stay off this line.

1107
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,749
- Call back at...
- What?

1108
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,806
I said get off the line.

1109
01:16:21,807 --> 01:16:24,463
I have been shot I will
not get off the line.

1110
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,729
Forgive me I'm sorry.

1111
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,079
Who are you?

1112
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,989
Laura Black.

1113
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,823
Laura, where were you shot?

1114
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:35,149
In the shoulder I've
lost a lot of blood.

1115
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:37,980
Laura, what
is your exact location?

1116
01:16:39,197 --> 01:16:43,030
I'm in the second floor
in a reception area.

1117
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:49,099
I need someone to get me out of here.

1118
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,529
Hang on, Laura.

1119
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,197
We're gonna try and get you out of there.

1120
01:16:52,198 --> 01:16:54,036
When?

1121
01:16:54,037 --> 01:16:55,204
When, I can't.

1122
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,549
I'm having a really hard time breathing.

1123
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:01,219
I think, my lungs is punctured.

1124
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,820
I think it's punctured, I can't.

1125
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,015
You gotta get me out of here.

1126
01:17:06,016 --> 01:17:08,763
Laura, just keep talking to us.

1127
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,013
I'll try.

1128
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,767
I'm gonna die.

1129
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:14,783
It's really.

1130
01:17:25,137 --> 01:17:26,840
Laura?

1131
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:28,519
Laura, talk to me.

1132
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,039
Hello?

1133
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:30,873
Laura?

1134
01:17:51,744 --> 01:17:52,730
Get the person who saw him drive

1135
01:17:52,731 --> 01:17:54,180
this motor home into the lot.

1136
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:58,343
Captain?

1137
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,349
This is Olson go ahead.

1138
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:04,309
Shagan, I'm in the motor home.

1139
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:06,919
He's carrying fuses and wire.

1140
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,623
He may have explosives in there.

1141
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,213
Yeah.

1142
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:59,383
It's Laura Black.

1143
01:18:59,384 --> 01:19:01,093
- Thank god
- I passed out.

1144
01:19:03,716 --> 01:19:06,319
Look I don't know how
much longer I can hang on.

1145
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,913
Someone's got to come
and get me out of here.

1146
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:11,439
Laura, listen.

1147
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,979
There's no way to send
someone in right now.

1148
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,698
You're gonna have to
sit tight for a while.

1149
01:19:21,866 --> 01:19:22,866
Laura?

1150
01:19:22,867 --> 01:19:23,700
Laura?

1151
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,769
I'm only gonna say this once.

1152
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:46,969
I can see the SWAT team from the window

1153
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:50,259
moving up on the Bancroft Boulevard side.

1154
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,109
I want them stopped,
or I'm just gonna start

1155
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,623
blowing things up around here.

1156
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,069
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1157
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,763
Now just take it easy.

1158
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:01,829
Look, I know I'm gonna die here.

1159
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,939
But I'm gonna decide when.

1160
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:07,111
Lieutenant Bannister,
have your people pullback

1161
01:20:07,112 --> 01:20:09,123
- from the Bancroft side.
- Right, sir.

1162
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,739
Tell me something, Rich.

1163
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,639
In addition to all the guns,

1164
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,440
do you have explosives in there too?

1165
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:22,570
You're damn right I do.

1166
01:20:22,571 --> 01:20:24,470
I came to teach these people a lesson.

1167
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,130
It's Laura's fault that
things got to this point.

1168
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:32,349
I warned her something
like this would happen.

1169
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:33,946
I told her I couldn't
let her get away with it,

1170
01:20:33,947 --> 01:20:35,449
and I'm warning you.

1171
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,699
We'll have a lot more bodies

1172
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,800
if I see anymore police near the building.

1173
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,189
Basically none of this would've happened

1174
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:44,079
if she'd gone out with me just one time.

1175
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,083
I don't think that was too much to ask.

1176
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,582
Do you?

1177
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,849
Why does she have to be so stubborn?

1178
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:52,129
I didn't even decide to hurt her

1179
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:53,603
until I got that court order.

1180
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,393
They were warned I
couldn't let that happen.

1181
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:02,260
That's why we've got
bodies all over the place.

1182
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,840
I had to show them.

1183
01:21:06,798 --> 01:21:08,248
Let them know I'm not a wimp.

1184
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,019
Look I'm gonna check on that SWAT team,

1185
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,491
and if I see them,
you've got a big problem.

1186
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:17,480
Look we'd
like to resolve things,

1187
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:19,180
so that nobody gets hurt.

1188
01:21:19,181 --> 01:21:20,526
Come on pullback.

1189
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:23,050
Tell them let's move it back.

1190
01:21:23,051 --> 01:21:25,827
Pull it back.

1191
01:21:25,828 --> 01:21:28,397
Alright, stay
back come on everybody.

1192
01:21:28,398 --> 01:21:33,150
Someone's coming out.

1193
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:34,458
Get down!

1194
01:21:34,459 --> 01:21:38,637
Get down!

1195
01:21:38,638 --> 01:21:40,464
- Watch your fire.
- Hold your fire.

1196
01:21:57,775 --> 01:21:59,373
This is all because of me.

1197
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,393
What did I do?

1198
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:04,319
Just tell me what I did?

1199
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,309
We're gonna get you to the hospital now.

1200
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,210
Just relax everything's gonna be fine.

1201
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:13,660
What's your name?

1202
01:22:15,618 --> 01:22:16,785
Laura Black.

1203
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,649
Well, tell me, Rich,

1204
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:28,019
how do you think we can resolve this?

1205
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,219
I don't think we can.

1206
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,739
I kind of made up my
mind I'm gonna die here.

1207
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,963
It's just a question of
when and who I take with me.

1208
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:41,023
Get me a diet Cola and
I'll think about it.

1209
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:45,213
I need a diet Cola and a sandwich.

1210
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,669
My boss might go for that.

1211
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,793
But he's gonna want something in return.

1212
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,849
I don't want a can of diet Cola.

1213
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:58,549
I want a cup, one of those
large quart sized cups

1214
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:59,813
with a lot of ice in it.

1215
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,133
I chew up ice, so I
need a lot of ice in it.

1216
01:23:12,126 --> 01:23:13,452
We gotta get moving here.

1217
01:23:13,453 --> 01:23:15,053
I don't like her blood pressure.

1218
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:16,950
I need a chest tube stat.

1219
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:19,249
She's got an entrance
one on her shoulder.

1220
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,449
Shattered up her humerus.

1221
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,572
Looks like a shotgun.
Figure it got to her lung.

1222
01:23:22,573 --> 01:23:25,649
I need a trauma room and
a vascular surgeon stat.

1223
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,549
We'll start transfusion right now.

1224
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:29,169
Make sure there's blood
in the trauma room.

1225
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,352
Where's the chest tube?

1226
01:23:30,353 --> 01:23:32,579
I need the chest tube.

1227
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:33,977
One, two, three.

1228
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:37,259
Does anybody know her name?

1229
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,479
Laura Black
they said it on the news.

1230
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,129
Don't check out on me, Laura, you hear?

1231
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:44,549
We're certain he's in this
area of the second floor.

1232
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:47,749
We're gonna try to
evacuate the first floor.

1233
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:49,909
We need you to keep him occupied.

1234
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:51,009
I can use the fact he wants us

1235
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:52,710
to get him a drink and a sandwich.

1236
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,179
I was hoping he might exchange the food

1237
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,389
for some of his guns.

1238
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:57,609
He could be getting tired.

1239
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:58,999
Well, if you can get
him to get rid of the guns

1240
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,947
by throwing them out of
any of these windows,

1241
01:24:00,948 --> 01:24:03,759
I can have one of my
sharpshooters take him out.

1242
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,003
Think you can do that?

1243
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,553
Well, I'd like to try and
get him to give up first.

1244
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:12,669
No problem.

1245
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,470
But if he's not willing,

1246
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:16,888
you get him in front of a window.

1247
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:19,803
Yes, sir.

1248
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:35,323
Yeah.

1249
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,613
He's got him on the line.

1250
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,439
How you doing in there?

1251
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,052
- Come on go.
- Come on, go.

1252
01:24:41,053 --> 01:24:44,700
On the double let's go guys.

1253
01:24:44,701 --> 01:24:46,316
First floor lobby.

1254
01:24:46,317 --> 01:24:48,519
Well, I'm thinking about giving up

1255
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,720
if that's what you mean?

1256
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:55,930
Hold on a minute.

1257
01:25:08,873 --> 01:25:10,123
Oh, it's Nancy.

1258
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,113
Come out of there, Nancy.

1259
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:23,960
You better get out of here.

1260
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:28,810
Let me do something for you, Rich.

1261
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:31,833
It's too late for that.

1262
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,033
Just go, Nancy.

1263
01:25:54,354 --> 01:25:55,937
What about my food?

1264
01:26:06,723 --> 01:26:08,899
Come on let's go bring her through.

1265
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,598
This way, this way.

1266
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:12,259
Well, like I said, Rich.

1267
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:15,069
My boss is gonna want something in return.

1268
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:16,139
Would you be willing to give up

1269
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,890
some of your weapons for some food?

1270
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,080
How would I get them to you?

1271
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,629
I was thinking if you
broke one of the windows

1272
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,580
facing Bancroft you can throw them out.

1273
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:29,229
Of course, we'd want you
to unload them first.

1274
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:31,080
No way, I'm giving you all my guns.

1275
01:26:32,403 --> 01:26:33,310
Well, how about just some of them.

1276
01:26:33,311 --> 01:26:34,779
It would be a sign, something I could

1277
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:37,173
take back to my boss,
Rich, you understand?

1278
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:40,983
Okay.

1279
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,770
Okay, I'll get rid of one of the shotguns

1280
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,203
and a 22-Magnum pistol.

1281
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,550
Now here's what I would like to eat

1282
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:54,269
besides the quart sized diet Cola

1283
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:57,203
a number 26 sandwich for Togo's.

1284
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,659
Togo's?

1285
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:03,129
It's just up to the street on Hollywood.

1286
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:03,963
Okay.

1287
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:09,940
I'd like a number 26, no
tomatoes with Swiss cheese.

1288
01:27:10,534 --> 01:27:12,853
- Okay, a number 26.
- It's their best.

1289
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:14,873
No tomatoes.

1290
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:16,833
Make it large.

1291
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:19,299
I may have to eat twice.

1292
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,603
I may be here a while.

1293
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,769
Hang on, Rich, don't hang up now.

1294
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:24,603
Give me a minute.

1295
01:27:24,604 --> 01:27:26,880
Let me pass this information
to my boss, okay?

1296
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,483
I can't find Laura here.

1297
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,573
I think she got out.

1298
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,490
I'd like to know if she's doing okay.

1299
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:36,999
I don't know
that I'll have to check

1300
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:37,930
and get back to you.

1301
01:27:37,931 --> 01:27:39,133
Yeah, check it.

1302
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,223
I think she got out.

1303
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,179
I hope she's doing good
'cause I want her to live.

1304
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,824
She can't regret it if she doesn't live.

1305
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:51,893
I want Laura to know I was serious.

1306
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,109
I had to get back at her.

1307
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:59,229
I'd go to her games, and she
would sit two feet from me.

1308
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:00,939
Then she'd point and laugh at me

1309
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,363
and talk behind my back.

1310
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,603
She can't play with people's lives.

1311
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,390
- Locked here.
- Ready.

1312
01:28:15,228 --> 01:28:17,478
Looks like him.

1313
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,669
We're set here, Captain.

1314
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:20,670
Copy that.

1315
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,177
Ready on two.

1316
01:28:25,831 --> 01:28:27,763
If you can get him
into position, we're set.

1317
01:28:31,325 --> 01:28:32,325
All right.

1318
01:28:33,633 --> 01:28:34,550
Here we go.

1319
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:38,342
Recording.

1320
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,439
How long does it take to get
a sandwich and a diet Cola?

1321
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,297
I have them right here
in front of me, Rich.

1322
01:28:53,298 --> 01:28:57,469
I have a number 26 and
a quart-sized diet Cola.

1323
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:59,970
All you gotta do is throw
the guns out the window.

1324
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,909
Okay, I'm gonna break
out one of the windows

1325
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:08,169
on the Bancroft side,

1326
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,220
and then I'm gonna throw out the weapons.

1327
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,289
Right, but make
sure they're all unloaded.

1328
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:16,816
Okay, I'm gonna try to break out

1329
01:29:16,817 --> 01:29:18,922
one of the windows with a chair.

1330
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,173
Rich?

1331
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,633
Yeah.

1332
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:31,453
One thing once you
throw the weapons out,

1333
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:34,949
we still have the problem
of getting the sandwich

1334
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,180
and the diet Cola back up to you.

1335
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:42,573
Yeah, we do.

1336
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,793
Why don't you come
down and have them here?

1337
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:54,610
Basically, give myself
up is what you're saying.

1338
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:58,210
That's what I'd like you to do, yes.

1339
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,579
First I'd have to ask myself

1340
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:08,163
do I really wanna live in jail?

1341
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:10,635
Of course, you do.

1342
01:30:10,636 --> 01:30:12,891
You could teach computers there.

1343
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:18,123
Yeah, I could teach there.

1344
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,783
I have to think about it.

1345
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:27,729
Rich, I have your diet
Cola sitting right here

1346
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:29,680
in front of me, and the ice is melting.

1347
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:35,697
The ice is melting, huh?

1348
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,673
Okay.

1349
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:45,273
Let me know when you're ready.

1350
01:30:47,586 --> 01:30:51,086
Hey, he's got him talked down.

1351
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,959
Doctor, can you tell me
anything about Laura Black?

1352
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,099
Are you a relative?

1353
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,239
I'm her roommate.

1354
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,439
Your roommate is a fighter.

1355
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,571
She's going to make it.

1356
01:31:02,572 --> 01:31:03,405
Oh, god.

1357
01:31:04,337 --> 01:31:05,639
Can I see her?

1358
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:08,099
They'll be taking her down
to recovery in a few minutes.

1359
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:08,933
Okay.

1360
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:10,949
When you come down the stairs,

1361
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:13,359
there'll be an officer there
to give you directions.

1362
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,313
Do exactly what he tells you to do.

1363
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:19,839
I try not to get down on my knees.

1364
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,453
They're bad and it hurts me.

1365
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,169
So if he wants me to get down on my knees,

1366
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:27,453
he's gonna have to let me go real slow.

1367
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,529
That's all right you can talk to him.

1368
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:32,913
Just tell him you're
gonna be moving real slow.

1369
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:36,419
I'm gonna come down there to meet you.

1370
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:39,513
Now remember move very, very slowly.

1371
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,413
You okay?

1372
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:44,543
I'm fine.

1373
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:47,593
Okay, I'll see you there.

1374
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:54,103
He's moving now.

1375
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:58,933
He's moving now.

1376
01:32:29,505 --> 01:32:31,179
All right just take it easy.

1377
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,779
Turn around hands against
the wall let's go.

1378
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,379
You better check my chest.

1379
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:36,899
I saw a movie once where
a guy had a Derringer

1380
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,253
on a chain around his neck.

1381
01:32:44,687 --> 01:32:47,049
Alright, you're under arrest.

1382
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:48,829
You have the right to remain silent.

1383
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:51,279
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

1384
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,709
You have a right to an attorney.

1385
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:55,539
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

1386
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:56,373
Do you understand these rights?

1387
01:32:56,374 --> 01:32:57,393
Where's my sandwich.

1388
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:24,973
Hi, Rich.

1389
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:27,590
I brought you your food.

1390
01:33:29,405 --> 01:33:30,879
- Let's go.
- Do you think Laura

1391
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,393
will remember all of this?

1392
01:35:50,004 --> 01:35:50,104
Webrip
