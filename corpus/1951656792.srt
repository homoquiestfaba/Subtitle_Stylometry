1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,751
Highway Patrolman

2
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,751
Rojas, come here at once!

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,950
I haven't got all day!

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,791
What classes do you have today?

5
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,037
Law. Self-defence.
Criminal psychology. Weaponry

6
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,392
This letter authorises you
to work for me

7
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,556
Show it to your tutors tomorrow

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,478
Sir, this will affect my marks

9
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,358
Report to my office in 15 minutes

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,271
Guerrero, come here at once!

11
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,511
Come with me

12
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,398
Cadet, help the ladies

13
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,751
Open the door

14
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,273
But I was right there

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,400
You were lucky

16
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,432
I had to cut the grass
and wash the car

17
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,028
I found condoms
in the glove compartment

18
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,472
- You're having me on
- I swear it's true

19
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,280
- Sorry, Sergeant. A tyre burst
- You'll pay for a new one

20
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,155
Two volunteers to change the wheel.
Guerrero and Leyva!

21
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,836
Who can give me the essence
of today's lesson?

22
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,232
You're the most stupid class
I've ever had!

23
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,268
Let's see if Cadet Rojas can
enlighten his illustrious colleagues

24
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,790
Three reasons to stop vehicles -

25
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,674
One, highway patrol violations

26
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,314
Two, mechanical defects

27
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,319
- Three...
- Stop thrashing about, Rojas

28
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,434
What is the essence
of today's lesson?

29
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,915
Well, it seems that whatever
the circumstances...

30
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,031
...they've always broken the law

31
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,515
Exactly!

32
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,234
They've always broken the law

33
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,238
When you follow a vehicle...

34
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,956
...stop it first,
then decide what they have done

35
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,198
- What have you learnt today?
- They've always broken the law!

36
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,831
Your rifle

37
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,431
Your pistol

38
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,311
Your badge

39
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,679
Cadet Pedro Rojas!

40
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,512
The National Highway Patrol...

41
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,196
...expects you to honour it...

42
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,993
...and maintain
the spirit of the service

43
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,271
Cake, Isabel?

44
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,713
I hope you like it

45
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,832
Congratulations, brother

46
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,631
Where's Dad?

47
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,752
You know he's tied up with work

48
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,153
You're lucky to have passed

49
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,477
I'd have failed if it wasn't for Pedro

50
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,591
Don't tell anyone

51
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,038
Mother, Dad hasn't spoken to me
in a year!

52
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,994
Don't be upset.
He wanted you to study medicine

53
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,238
You're the first
to have finished his studies

54
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,239
No matter what Dad thinks,
I'm proud of my brother...

55
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,351
...the patrolman

56
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,752
Your first assignment...

57
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,635
...is Sector Four
of the Northern Z one, Highway 82

58
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,588
You've been highly recommended.
I expect an ex emplary performance

59
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,152
Report to Lieutenant Perez.
He will allocate a car to you

60
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,151
You get number 27, Rojas

61
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,755
Our best car, because
they say you are a good driver

62
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,871
Thank you, Lieutenant

63
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,432
I'm warning you...

64
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,028
...one scratch
and I'll knock the shit out of you

65
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,350
- Congratulations
- Thank you, Lieutenant

66
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,915
May I see your licence?

67
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,872
You're putting lives at risk, driving the
wrong way down a one-way street

68
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,991
What is your explanation?

69
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,876
I'm late for work
and my boss wants to fire me

70
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,199
My mother is ill, my father beats me
and my dog has died

71
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,275
You should leave earlier
to get to work on time

72
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,514
I could impound your car
for three days

73
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,154
Here is your licence

74
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,153
I'll overlook it this time

75
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,159
Everything is all right. Right?

76
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,431
Have a nice day

77
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,631
Buy our iguanas!

78
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,594
Pedro, they've assigned us
to look after hell

79
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,079
Even buzzards are at a loss here

80
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,036
- What would you like?
- Ice cold beers

81
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,880
The beers have all gone, lads

82
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,070
There is only tequila

83
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,273
- What about those gringos?
- They brought their own beer

84
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,598
No beer. Bring tequila then

85
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,471
What do you reckon?

86
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,634
Beer

87
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,751
No, thank you

88
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,235
German, the best

89
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,635
Mexican beer is best

90
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,474
You've never been
to an Oktoberfest...

91
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,795
Can't you see we're busy?

92
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,751
I'll leave them there

93
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,558
How do they expect us
to make money here?

94
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,671
Meet our quotas

95
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,758
Check trucks and permits

96
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,352
Dealers smuggle drugs
in truckloads of explosives

97
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,393
Don't mess with them,
they're really dangerous

98
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,511
We mustn't be afraid of them

99
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,031
It's poison!

100
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,468
- What's wrong?
- No front bumper

101
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,397
It was stolen last night

102
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,433
- Open the back
- I've nothing but canned goods

103
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,073
Nothing but canned goods?

104
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,351
Take this ball

105
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,993
Shoes for your son. A bathing suit

106
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,989
I'm impounding this merchandise.
Follow me to the police station

107
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,035
I'm only making a living

108
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,871
Thanks for remembering my children

109
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,833
Getting permission was difficult

110
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,988
God will know how to thank you

111
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,114
It takes so little to make them happy,
doesn't it?

112
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,751
May I have a cigarette?

113
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,313
"S ONS OF TH E ARMY"

114
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,155
Come to our restaurant, El Famlllar

115
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,955
Try our dellclous clllaqulles
In green sauce...

116
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,868
...and our succulent
luevos rancleros

117
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,038
If you're so weary, stay at home
instead of sucking travellers' blood

118
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,677
Article 70 - trucks are not
public transport. Licence, please

119
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,475
How am I supposed to take
my workers to the fields?

120
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,591
In a limousine?

121
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,995
It's obvious that
you come from the city

122
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,714
Leave him alone, Señorita Griselda

123
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,557
- Griselda...
- Don't you like my name?

124
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,035
It's unusual, but I like it

125
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,351
What now? Because I am not
going to give you money

126
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,759
You'll breakfast with your workers.
I've not eaten since yesterday

127
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,955
You want to have breakfast?

128
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,679
Do you know Pancho Villa Street?

129
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,876
Do you know where the plaza is?

130
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,118
My house is two blocks
from the plaza. Number 115

131
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,391
I'll be waiting there... in an hour

132
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,430
Don't be late

133
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,508
Is Señorita Griselda in?

134
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,110
We've been waiting for you.
You are two hours late

135
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,591
Lots of work?

136
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,554
Highway problems, Señor Marcos

137
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,831
Never mind. You can come here
whenever you like

138
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,720
Why haven't the service station
robbers been caught yet?

139
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,915
That's a matter
for the municipal police, not us

140
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,274
Well consider this your home

141
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,832
Please help me with my sleeve

142
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,198
I hope I won't make it worse

143
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,236
What happened to your face?

144
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,434
When I was a boy, some friends
threw me through a window

145
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,836
With such friends,
I'd hate to meet your enemies

146
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,997
Life in the capital, Señorita Griselda

147
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,998
How do you like it in Mapimi?

148
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,714
It's lovely

149
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,434
They say that God was born
in Mapimi

150
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,999
- An egg?
- Yes please, Señorita Griselda

151
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,795
All my friends call me Z eldita

152
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,109
You're dead tired

153
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,198
Zanaida, prepare the guest room
for the officer

154
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,278
It's not necessary, Señor Marcos

155
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,830
Patrolmen never rest. Always looking
down the barrel of a gun

156
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,952
- True?
- True... Z eldita

157
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,318
Father, weren't you going
to do something?

158
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,670
No, I've got no plans

159
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,236
You asked me to remind you
of something

160
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,351
Oh yes...

161
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,077
I was going to change
the flowers on your mother's grave

162
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,509
I'll come to the door with you

163
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:51,476
- What about Father?
- He's very tired and his leg hurts

164
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,754
Tell him I miss him very much

165
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,155
Let's get going, my love

166
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,949
I need money for irrigating the ranch

167
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,390
A patrolman's salary
isn't big enough for that

168
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,750
Open the door for me

169
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,680
I know how to do it

170
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,794
- Put it on the floor
- OK

171
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,833
You know a patrolman's salary
is barely enough to get by on

172
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,033
Somehow we must have
more money here

173
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,511
Don't drool on me

174
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,032
Don't worry, all women
are the same. She'll get over it

175
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,232
A wedding ring is a tightening noose

176
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,157
I just washed it

177
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,271
It's dirty here

178
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,399
- How goes it, Anibal?
- A promise is a debt

179
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,958
- How much?
- Half. And check the oil in my car

180
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,951
What are you doing?
Get rid of that banger

181
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,755
It's fine. I just need
to change the plugs

182
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,072
- Change the car
- The car's fine

183
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,949
Rojas. Report to the Commandant

184
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,592
What have you done?

185
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,517
Who knows

186
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,351
You're worn out

187
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,990
Come for some fun at the Oasis
after your shift

188
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,839
No. Thanks all the same, Anibal

189
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,631
What's happening, Rojas?

190
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,790
I hear you aren't fulfilling your quota
for tickets. Is there a problem?

191
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,754
The road is deserted.
There's almost no traffic

192
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,634
Officer Guerrero
seems to have no problem

193
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,799
- I'm not interested in him
- But I am, Rojas!

194
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,071
Because of your poor performance
I am assigning you to Route 44

195
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,668
- The pig route?
- Precisely

196
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,839
If you don't manage
to fulfil your duties there...

197
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,839
...I'll have to suspend you.
Understand?

198
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,951
- Yes, sir
- Dismissed

199
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,076
I think one is dead

200
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,395
Did you ask for the permits?

201
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,629
He has the vet's examination papers
but no health permits

202
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,355
I'll check. Confiscate the dead pig

203
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,030
Sorry, but without health permits
I can't allow you to go any further

204
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,671
All the Health Department red tape...

205
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,270
The pigs will die of old age
before I get permits

206
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,836
I have Doctor Matanzas' certificate...

207
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,114
...and a donation
to your department's retirement fund

208
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,516
We appreciate your donation

209
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,234
But you can't leave without permits

210
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,791
Every time they change the officer,
the bribe goes up

211
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,193
I'm not informed about that

212
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,471
I'll inform you. There you are

213
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,914
Please stamp my permit

214
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,478
Even stones bleed out here,
don't they?

215
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,675
- What's this?
- The dead pig

216
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,870
They're not going to eat it!

217
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,639
The poor people
haven't got much else

218
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,633
What are you drinking? I'll pay

219
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,034
Looking for company?

220
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,196
I'm married

221
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,475
Everyone here is married

222
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,949
Buy us a drink

223
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,877
Waiter!

224
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,673
A round of drinks for the ladies

225
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,955
Not like that. Dance slowly

226
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,072
Come on. Get up and go. Time's up

227
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,198
- Out, Pepe
- Pedro... Pedro Rojas

228
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,236
Come and see me soon, Pedro.
I like you

229
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,032
Officer Pedro Rojas

230
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,471
Emilio. Are you paying a visit?

231
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,277
- What time do you call this?
- It's only five in the morning.

232
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,279
Don't try to be funny, you fool.
Where have you been?

233
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,318
Don't yell, you'll wake your father

234
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,431
Since when have you cared?

235
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,154
I'll do what I please in my house

236
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,193
We'll see about that.
No one makes a fool of me

237
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,311
I'm warning you, Pedro

238
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,671
It's my house...

239
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,836
...and no one makes a fool of me

240
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,952
I'm warning you, Pedro!

241
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,435
Just you wait and see

242
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,274
Where have you been, Pedro?

243
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,155
I'm talking to you

244
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,593
If you do this again you won't live
to see another day, I swear it

245
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,671
And if you give me
a venereal disease...

246
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,519
...I'll serve your balls for breakfast

247
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,671
You're making money at last,
Pedro dear

248
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,031
You should have said
you were working

249
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,151
Come on. We must get there first

250
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,508
Car 27, reporting from the accident
on Highway 27

251
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,312
There's another one inside

252
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,990
- How goes it, Anibal?
- Fine

253
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,632
It's a good job we got here first.
Those vultures never leave a thing

254
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,035
How about this? Nice, eh?

255
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,109
It's for you to keep, Pedro

256
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,351
I'm going after them

257
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,917
Car 27...

258
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,079
...reporting a suspicious yellow
Gremlin without number plates

259
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,192
Stop immediately!

260
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,715
Take it easy, boss.
We don't want to end up full of holes

261
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,229
You're drunk. Get out of the car!

262
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,197
Hold on, calm down

263
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,438
Don't muck about with me.
Show me your licence!

264
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,318
Take it easy, just give me a moment.
Don't upset me

265
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,556
Give us a ticket quickly.
We're in a hurry

266
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,352
Simon, show him your licence

267
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,034
Goodbye, copper!

268
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,756
Car 27, Code 44

269
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,916
I've been shot in the leg

270
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,156
Car 27, Offlcer Rojas,
report your posltlon

271
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,391
Pedro. Wake up, man

272
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,032
I must speak to you, boy

273
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,912
- Father?
- Yes. Don't you recognise me?

274
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,431
Dad, I'm happy to see you

275
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,553
Those men almost killed you

276
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,676
I wasn't careful enough

277
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,151
It won't happen again

278
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,038
You'll end up crippled, like me

279
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,518
All because of those damn cops who
blew my knee off in the 1962 strike

280
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,750
I'll be all right, you'll see

281
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,039
Reconsider all this, son.
Come and work with me

282
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,871
Is that why you came?

283
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,715
You almost lost your life.
Don't keep disobeying me!

284
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,229
Father, I'm a patrolman
and I always will be

285
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,229
After this you insist on remaining
a petty taker of bribes?

286
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,270
Please don't treat me like this

287
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,831
We'll meet again, Pedro

288
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,031
In another life

289
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,230
Father, don't leave me here

290
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,351
Help me!

291
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,512
When you grow up,
you'll work like Daddy, Lucerito

292
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:51,192
Pedro, please.
Don't start giving her ideas

293
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,914
So being a patrolman
means nothing?

294
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,155
Don't get upset

295
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,276
You know your public service work
gets very little recognition

296
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,279
Dad came to insult me, too

297
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,877
Your father?

298
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,471
Your father...

299
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,271
...has died

300
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,037
While you were in hospital

301
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,510
You had such a fever

302
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,834
We couldn't break the news to you

303
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,279
I'll put the baby to bed

304
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,477
Eat

305
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,670
What did they do to you?

306
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,716
Don't touch me there.
It hurts like hell

307
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,239
It's a dangerous job, isn't it?

308
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,236
Your job is dangerous too

309
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,591
Maribel, why do you do this?

310
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,548
What do you mean "why"?

311
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,790
Why are you a cop?

312
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,435
You can't compare jobs

313
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,113
No? What do you know?

314
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,231
I have two children

315
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,668
My husband left me two years ago

316
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,035
Do you think I do it for fun?

317
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,674
No, not that

318
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,391
Get the hell out of here

319
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,479
I never want to see you again

320
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,432
Maribel, I didn't mean to offend you

321
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,518
Fuck off! I don't want to see you

322
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,351
Damn leg!

323
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,189
Are you all right? What happened?

324
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,869
- I hit a truck
- You were chasing it?

325
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,912
No, I shifted to first
instead of reverse

326
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,474
Well you did a thorough job

327
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,476
Do you think it's funny?

328
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,993
This vehicle is public property
and you are responsible for it

329
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,109
You must pay for the repairs

330
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,318
In the meantime, use this car

331
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,149
No objections or you'll keep it

332
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,435
Pull over! That's an order!

333
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,639
- Let's see how brave you are now
- Don't kill me!

334
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,070
Why should I stain my hands
with your blood?

335
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,509
Your cellmates can rape you

336
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,315
I'm Ramon Lopez Perez,
son of the state governor

337
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,150
- Bullshit! I'll knock that out of you
- I swear! I'm Ramon Lopez Perez!

338
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,114
I'm taking you in. Your friends can
wait for the pick-up truck

339
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,277
Eliseo, call my father at the mansion

340
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,073
I'll call my uncle at the police too

341
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,351
- Why not call the President?
- I know him, too

342
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,079
I swear I'm Ramon Lopez Perez

343
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,029
My uncle will fix that creep

344
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,638
Stop crying, sissy. You're all right

345
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,759
You've really screwed things up,
Pedro

346
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,759
First you crash your car. Then you
rough up the Governor's son

347
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,509
He deserved a bigger beating
than he got

348
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,758
Sure, but you know
these little rich boys

349
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,110
They're made of porcelain

350
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,118
You can't touch them.
Daddy is someone

351
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,279
- It was a misunderstanding
- Control your animals

352
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,391
Don't you insult me!

353
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,351
Navarro, sort this creep out

354
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,517
- Just try that again!
- Clear off, you brat!

355
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,438
Rojas, come to my office

356
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,718
Never draw a gun on a minor

357
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,479
It's the first thing we teach you!

358
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,556
So what happened?

359
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,672
I'm on report. I must go and see
Doctor Bolaños in Torreon

360
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,598
Rojas, car 27 is ready

361
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,111
Assign it to someone else.
I've got used to 112

362
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,915
You're joking.
This car is a death-trap

363
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,755
No. The 112 engine
is more powerful

364
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,268
Pedro, take 27. It's a better car

365
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,391
Like this gun, it's better

366
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,553
Smith and Wesson automatic.
You can't compare it to your gun

367
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,750
What's the difference?

368
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,871
They both kill

369
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,033
Are you sure
you didn't hate your father?

370
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,755
He was very strict but I loved him

371
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,591
And you still like women?

372
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,437
Absolutely

373
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,078
Doctor, be frank

374
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,953
Do you think there is
something wrong with me?

375
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,834
Officer Rojas, take these pills

376
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,070
If they don't work
I'll prescribe stronger ones

377
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,557
Señor Peña, your bus
is in no condition to be driven

378
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,639
Give us a break. We're not going far

379
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,473
Think of the kids.
They're all mentally retarded

380
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,398
Besides I was going
to give you a big tip

381
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,470
It's not a question of money. You're
responsible for the children's safety

382
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,592
Car 19, this is 112. Over

383
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,917
White caravan, licence 471 O VE,
coming your way

384
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,031
Driver was smoking a joint

385
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,436
We'll collect off tlem.
Tlanks, Pedro.!

386
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:35,829
Be careful, they look like smugglers.
Keep radio contact. I'll join you

387
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,319
There's a campsite up there

388
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,557
It's for girls
but I'm sure they'll admit you

389
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,434
God bless you, Officer. You're kind

390
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,596
Have a drink on me

391
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,715
Drive carefully, Señor Peña

392
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,513
What are you looking at?
Get inside

393
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:29,075
Car 19, I've spotted them.
I'm moving to intercept

394
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,836
Car 19. I'm bellnd tle wllte caravan

Relax, Pedro. Flx It and tlen follow

405
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,114
Take cover. I'm almost with you

406
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,115
I can't hear you, Anibal!

407
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,675
Speak clearly, I can't hear you!

408
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,194
Where are you, brother? Hold on!

409
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,511
What happened to you?

410
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,232
What have they done to you?

411
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,030
Where was God
when they did this to you?

412
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,390
What would you like, gentlemen?

413
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,511
A bottle of tequila

414
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,432
I'm sorry, we serve only cocktails

415
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,552
Tequila, or I'll knock the shit
out of you!

416
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,598
Sorry.
We've just come from a funeral

417
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,518
Please make an exception
in this case

418
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,915
Thirty years in the service...

419
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,876
...and I can't get used to this

420
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,835
To Anibal, Pedro.
We must never forget him

421
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:50,113
I'm going to look for those gringos.
They're going to pay

422
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,390
Don't waste your time.
They're out of the country by now

423
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,840
Learn from what happened
and forget the whole thing

424
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,237
But be sure to remember
your friend Anibal...

425
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,034
...who died doing his duty

426
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,391
Tle Wllte House las stated...

427
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,796
...tlat drug smuggllng
from Mexlco Is up 30%

428
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,388
Turn off that television!

429
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,715
And bring another bottle of tequila

430
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,791
And another glass

431
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,951
Salud, Sergeant

432
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,951
Buy our iguanas!

433
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,355
Why aren't you at school?

434
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,869
We don't want to go

435
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,709
Don't you know it's illegal
to sell iguanas on the highway?

436
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,149
- Where did you get them?
- The mountains

437
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,352
You don't want to go to prison?

438
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,630
Tell me where your school is then

439
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,716
It's up there

440
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,832
You don't want to go?

441
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,633
Well I'm taking you up there
right now

442
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,148
Take your hands off the car

443
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,871
You think it's funny?

444
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,998
Officer, we have a big problem.
A rabid dog, over in the corral

445
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,673
- What happened to her?
- The dog bit her

446
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,917
Take her to the clinic at once!

447
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,273
Don't follow me,
it might be dangerous

448
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,829
You have a problem, too?

449
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,554
It's my daughter,
these children's mother

450
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,319
As long as it's not another dog

451
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,952
You must pay for killing my chicken

452
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,117
You fool

453
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,594
Can you take my grandson?

454
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,959
They left my daughter here
this afternoon

455
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,709
- Maribel?
- Do you know her?

456
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,308
Then help her. She can't stay here

457
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,158
Maribel, what's wrong with you?

458
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,033
It's Pedro. Don't you recognise me?

459
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:02,836
Maribel, what did they do to you?

460
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,832
I'm all right, don't worry

461
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,469
- I'm freezing
- Put my coat on

462
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,354
- Put that animal away
- It's only an iguana, Pedro

463
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,994
Careful, there's another somewhere

464
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,111
Don't be a sissy

465
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,472
I'll take you to the bar but you must
tell me who is giving you the drugs

466
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,478
- What's it to you?
- I'm not mucking about

467
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,910
Me neither.
Stop acting like Tarzan's mother

468
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,429
You can't change things

469
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,315
- What are they for?
- Pills. For my nerves

470
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,510
Let me help you

471
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,712
Keep out of my problems

472
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,559
Let me buy you something to eat
at least

473
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,672
- If you like
- Two portions of cllclarrón

474
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,548
Come and see me sometime

475
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,436
Emilio, listen. I need some now

476
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,439
Emilio, I'm dying. Let's go inside

477
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,076
- Who was that cop?
- A customer, like all the others

478
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:14,078
Car 27, report your posltlon

479
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,115
Can you tell me the time?

480
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,357
Come on, can't you afford a watch?

481
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,191
It's very late

482
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,039
Pedro, breakfast is ready

483
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,032
What are you doing?

484
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,549
I'm just checking Anibal's gun

485
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,950
You can't forget, can you?

486
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,439
I couldn't save his life

487
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,391
Be careful, that's all I ask

488
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,951
I'm your wife

489
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,035
But I don't want to be your widow

490
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,112
Get out, wltl your lands up.!

491
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,711
Where are you going?

492
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,515
I'm taking my brother to work
in Nuevo Laredo tomorrow

493
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,110
- What's your job?
- I'm a journalist...

494
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,957
- Show me your press card
- It's at home in Browns ville

495
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,117
Journalist?

496
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,231
Don't you mean smuggler?

497
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,920
- Open the boot
- I haven't got the key

498
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,510
You travel light

499
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,029
Maybe your heavy bags
are elsewhere?

500
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,550
On your knees, you bastard!

501
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,831
Drop your trousers

502
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,475
Why? This is abuse by the police

503
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,511
What have we got here?
Where did you get this stuff?

504
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,997
They'll kill us if we squeal

505
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,315
That's not my problem

506
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,512
What about the helicopter
beyond the mountains?

507
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,438
It's the distributors, foreigners

508
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,869
We take their drugs across for them

509
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,118
- When are they due back?
- In two days, stuff for Los Organos

510
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,916
Please don't kill me.
For my children's sake

511
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,589
We haven't done anything

512
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,957
Clear off

513
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,797
The car?

514
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,317
- Can I come in?
- Yes

515
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,557
Finished?

516
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,471
A few moments ago

517
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,436
Want to cover yourself?

518
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,756
Don't you like me like this?

519
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,513
Take this money. And the drugs

520
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,080
Go and dry out at your mother's

521
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,113
Who are you to order me about?

522
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,470
A patrolman

523
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,114
Obey me or go to jail

524
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,990
Pedro, there is no cure for me

525
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,271
I am going to die

526
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,632
Then die at home

527
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,230
I don't want to find you dead
in this crappy place

528
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,871
Hold me

529
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,352
Pack and I'll take you to the bus

530
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,556
Hug your mother and the kids for me

531
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:45,276
Tell me if you need anything

532
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,517
Call me through HQ
when you get home

533
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,474
Enough of that, we're off now

534
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,311
Rojas, we're out of work. You
haven't wrecked your car in months

535
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,637
Check the points
while I see the Commandant

536
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:27,235
I've received a report
from the police

537
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,153
They stopped two men
on the highway

538
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:41,071
They said a patrolman confiscated
their drugs then let them go

539
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,910
Do you know anything about this?

540
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,589
The police are very naive

541
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:54,033
I'm sure it's just a yarn.
The drugs have been hidden

542
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,031
- You don't know anything?
- Absolutely nothing

543
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,112
I'll tell them to make further enquiries

544
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,231
You may go now

545
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:20,029
Be careful, lad. I'll be keeping
a close eye on you. Understand?

546
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,993
Emilio!
It's Pedro Rojas of the PN DC

547
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:48,432
All I want to know is
who the guys in the helicopter were

548
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,313
Come and get me, if you can!

549
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,914
Emilio, I'm Maribel's friend

550
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,634
Let's drop our guns and make a deal

551
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,194
Just come and get me!

552
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,877
I only wanted to talk to you, that's all

553
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,551
Fuck!

554
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,595
I'll tell him at once

555
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,472
Central Office congratulates you,
Rojas

556
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:22,030
He was a drug trafficker.
He deserved it

557
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,839
- I only wanted to detain him
- That you did. Congratulations

558
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:32,353
However, I must suspend you
for 30 days during the investigation

559
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,277
Why?

560
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,075
It's routine,
when there's been a death

561
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,590
The police insist
that weekly deliveries were 15 kilos

562
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:48,878
They accuse me
of concealing the drugs?

563
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,278
You know how they are.
They suspect everybody

564
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:02,191
I'm resigning, Commandant

565
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:09,271
The Highway Patrol rewards
its most effective personnel, Rojas

566
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:15,074
We must be tough. You have
a great future in the Corporation

567
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,317
I don't give a damn. I'm going home

568
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,794
Stupid little boys

569
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,833
Most don't even make it this far

570
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:45,551
- What's wrong with the baby?
- Who knows, Dad

571
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:52,711
Don't forget to tell Venancio
to repair the cow pasture fence

572
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:57,959
Drive carefully. Don't hurt the boys

573
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:07,119
Buy me the afternoon edition
of "The Voice of the North"

574
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,270
And don't forget my change

575
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:14,472
- Is that all?
- No. My kiss

576
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,036
What's so funny?

577
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,990
What a nice surprise

578
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:58,032
Maribel, you have a visitor

579
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:07,992
Pedro, I'm surprised to see you

580
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,989
I couldn't come before, what with
quitting the service and everything

581
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:17,159
I can imagine.
I went to Headquarters a month ago

582
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,317
Invite the officer for a cup of tea

583
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,750
We'd invite you to eat
but there isn't enough

584
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,029
I'm glad to see you looking well

585
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,550
But for how long?

586
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,233
Pedro, live with us.
We'll be very happy

587
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:46,678
No, I can't leave my family,
my daughter

588
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,318
So I'll have to go back to the bar

589
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,635
No, please don't

590
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,753
How am I supposed to feed
my family?

591
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:02,479
You promised to give me money,
or have you forgotten?

592
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:08,357
If you don't want to live here
and I can't work... What then?

593
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,233
What the hell am I supposed to do?

594
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,634
Are you going to support me
or what?

595
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,635
Yes. I'll give you money every month

596
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,356
Thanks, Pedro

597
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,110
You're great

598
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,310
Maribel, the child!

599
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,036
Buy our iguanas!
