The fucking package was a girl.

172
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,240
<i>What? Oh, fuck.
What did you do?</i>

173
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,210
She shot the guy.

174
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,779
With your shotgun.

175
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:08,683
<i>Oh, my God.
[stutters] Is he dead?</i>

176
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,653
I don't know. I think so. I...

177
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:15,890
<i>Oh, we're so fucked.
What are we gonna do?</i>

178
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:18,492
<i>- What-what are you hauling?</i>
- Unloading in Oxford.

179
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:20,494
Got another taking me
to Jackson. That's it.

180
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:21,896
<i>Okay, all right,
you just listen.</i>

181
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,698
<i>Just seem... Just seem
regular, you know.</i>

182
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,833
<i>Just finish whatever
bookings you got.</i>

183
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,902
Are you gonna be okay?

184
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:29,771
<i>You're in danger, sis.</i>

185
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,573
<i>These guys have eyes all
over the fucking state.</i>

186
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:36,644
And the girl... where
do I drop the girl?

187
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:38,756
<i>I don't know, I don't know. You just
gotta take her... take her with you.</i>

188
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,548
- What?
- <i>I-I don't know.</i>

189
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,751
No! No way she can
stay in my truck.

190
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,853
<i>She's the only thing
keepin' us safe.</i>

191
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:47,380

- Fuck off! Motherfucker!

This is your guy, right?

204
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:49,830
Fuck. Yeah, I took him
down a half year ago

205
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:53,034
when we busted the
MacDougal traffic ring.

206
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:57,004
Low level sergeant,
oversaw one of the routes.

207
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,642
- He's out already?
- [man] Out on bond.

Fingerprints only
from the victim.

212
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,123
[sighs] They ended
him with a slug.

213
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:20,094
- Nasty choice for a hit job.
- Hmm.

214
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,129
Other slug's in that
tree over there.

215
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:26,100
And you're retired
for how long now?

216
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:30,137
Consultant Gerick
at your service.

217
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:34,608
[chuckles] So, who's
your new assistant?

218
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:36,811
Ah, desk rat from legal.

219
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:40,681
Wants field experience.
Went to Yale.

220
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:42,917
I heard they have a very
good English department.

221
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,552
[Gerick] Mm.

222
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,656
Strange.

223
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:51,292
Paul came here

224
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,594
to pick up a girl

225
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:56,297
who'd been transported
across the state line.

226
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,532
His normal routine.
But then...

227
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,103
Why?

228
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,638
It's what we're
trying to figure out.

229
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:07,675
We got wider and deeper tracks
from the second vehicle.

230
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,976
It's probably a truck.

231
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,080
Yeah. Refrigerated
trailer or dry van.

232
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:15,316
No tarp.

233
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:19,620
All right, well, start by alerting
the weigh stations, Finley.

234
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:22,590
Excuse me, Gerick. Just,
please, call me by my last name.

235
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:25,059
- All right, Yale.
- Sterling.

236
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:27,661
You gonna make those calls or
you gonna write a poem about it?

237
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,198
I'll make the calls. Just,
please, call me Sterling.

238
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:32,767
Yeah.

239
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,637

241
00:25:55,823 --> 00:25:58,192
Never seen you so
lazy, Ms. Sally.

242
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,960
Sorry, Frank, got a bad knee.

243
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:01,896
[girl coughs]

244
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,264
You got a lover in there, huh?

245
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:05,166
Always.

246
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:09,737
Uh-huh. Well, you ready to roll.

247
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,906
[dramatic music playing]

248
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:27,054
[man indistinct]

249
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,026
Take these out to the car.

250
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,428
- [mutters]
- Whoa.

251
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,097
- Come on, come on.
- Fine.

252
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:11,298
All right.

253
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:13,334
Hey, so, State Police

254
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,045
are doing us a favor
on the weigh stations,

255
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,904
and we got a match on
the muddy tire tracks

256
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,348
headed onto the south
highway entrance.

257
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:19,907
So Mississippi, not Tennessee.

258
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,009
- And...
- Here.

259
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,445
Yeah, Gerick, I'm
not your assistant.

260
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:27,381
This is my case, and I appreciate
having you on as a consultant,

261
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,426
but right now, we just need
you to sign this, and then...

262
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,418
We start with files
from last year.

263
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:34,255
I'll bet he was whacked by
one of his little buddies.

264
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:37,258
We take a look at
all known associates.

265
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,227
Find out which one might've
had a beef with Paul.

266
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:42,229
And we're looking
for a girl. One.

267
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,465
He always bought
'em one at a time.

268
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,201
Yeah, so we just need you to sign
this report for headquarters.

269
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:50,004
- No time for bureaucracy, Yale.
- [chuckles]

270
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:53,307
I think you're taking this
a bit too personally, sir.

271
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,843
- Excuse me?
- I think you heard me.

272
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,148
All right. We're taking my car.

273
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:04,385
And let me know where we're
at with that cell phone.

274
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:05,719

275

[horns honking]

276
00:28:10,124 --> 00:28:11,992
Okay, so we did
crack Paul's phone.

277
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:14,228
It wasn't easy. With recent
numbers already being dead,

278
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,106
we couldn't trace it, and
no registered address.

279
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,774
But he did pay for the phone
bill with a credit card

280
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:20,334
that also paid the
utilities at an address.

281
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,937
Good lung capacity there, Yale.

282
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,005
What is that, Ivy
League swim team?

283
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,941
I put in a request
for a warrant.

284
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,976
- Ah, we're not waiting for that.
- Gerick.

285
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:33,247
[man] Something's not right.

286
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:36,518
Paul should've called by now.

287

Go back to your room!

290
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:10,451
Be smart. Stay in the back.

291
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:13,521
Don't let anybody see you, okay?

[people chattering]

296
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,582
- [man] Who's that girl?
- [bang on door]

297
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:17,017
- [man] What the fuck are you doing?
- [woman] Goddamnit!

298
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:20,321
Does anyone care that
I am working next door?

299
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:23,057

Hmm. My brother. He's good.

311

Champ. He'll help.

312
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,382
You got a brother?

Guess you don't have no
mom or dad either, huh?

What are you? Baby Jesus?

What's your name?

00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:44,938
Leila.

319

346

Just don't bite and
kick 'em, all right?

347
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:58,011
<i>Still hiding in the woods.</i>

348
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,379
<i>It's not yet confirmed...</i>

349
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:02,382
I don't like the police.

350
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:06,320

manhunt covers both states.</i>

You crying 'cause you're scared, or you
crying 'cause that piece of shit is dead?

354
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:28,442
You know, Leila, you
might have shot him,

355
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:30,545
but I left him there to die.

356
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:36,016
- [breathes deeply]
- We're in this together.

357
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:49,396
Oh, we can't cross state lines.

358
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:51,633
It's too risky with
the weigh stations.

359
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:56,604
Mm-mm.

360
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,574
I'll get us to a place
where we can't be found.

361
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:03,477
We'll wait there till
my brother has a plan.

00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:26,133
Yes, Patterson,
yes. I know, I know.

364
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:29,136
You have to see the girl in
order for me to get the warrant,

365
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:32,139
even if I need the warrant
to get the fucking girl!

366
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:36,844
You know, we might
still be able to get it.

367
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,681
I'm afraid the idiots at
legal disagree with you, Yale.

368
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:41,792
[chuckles] All right, well,
I used to work there, so...

369
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:45,319
I know that. You're the idiot
who refused to issue the warrant

370
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:48,422

from getting out on bond!

Okay. My buddy caught a
glimpse of a young girl

poking her head out of a
blue Peterbilt yesterday.

375

Said the truck was
headed south on 49.

376
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:40,893
Called some of our friends down
there to be on the lookout.

Florida is a dump.

I don't care if it's a dump when
you can go wherever you want.

Where do you
wanna go? Walmart?

No. The ocean.

Oh.

414
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:20,528
The neighbor said she saw girls
walking in and out of the house.

00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:23,931
"Maybe should've called someone," she
says, but doesn't wanna get involved.

- Hm.
- I can't believe people are like this.

417
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:30,738
Well, write a poem about it.

Isn't that what you do at Yale?

419
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,109
No. Sometimes we write essays.

420

[chuckles] Well,
get her statement.

421
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,046

424
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,925
All right, Patterson.
We got what you need.

way to Arkansas tomorrow.</i>

up in Utica tomorrow.

with the load you're carrying.</i>

border and meet you?

I'm not going back home, Dennis.

I haven't been there

We found a dog in the basement.

We need a few minutes
to tranquilize it.

457

Okay.

458
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,754
Saunders?

Neighbors say they saw the girls
walking around the neighborhood.

I don't understand.

00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,780
Why didn't they...
call the police?

462
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:55,983
Ask for help? Something.

463
00:41:56,017 --> 00:42:00,087
These kids have been fucked over by the
system since the day they were born.

464
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,190
They don't call the police.

465
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:06,994
Nobody gives a shit
and they know it.

466
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:13,167
They also know that if they
step out of line what happens.

467
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:16,303
That's what the basement is for.

468

- A kid had been in this cage.
- What?

469
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:42,196
A kid had been in this
cage. Bolted to the wall.

470
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:46,033
Dog was running loose.

471
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:47,334
From the looks of the dog,

472
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:49,303
it had been trained
to be aggressive.

473
00:42:49,336 --> 00:42:51,705
Traces of blood on the bolts.

474
00:42:53,374 --> 00:42:56,811
Looks like someone tried
to claw their way out.

475
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,879
Fresh. Couple of days.

476
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:00,848
We just missed them.

00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:02,316
Clothes in the cage.

Pant size, dress size.

479
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:07,254
She's probably about
five feet. Young.

480
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,890
And she found a
pencil to doodle with.

[dramatic music playing]

482
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:48,162
You know this place?

483
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:06,280
This truck stop's so big...

484
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:10,251
even the pimps don't
know their way around.

485
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:12,386
We can hide here till tomorrow.

486
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:26,200
Okay.

00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,771

Hair spray, AKA pepper spray.

00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:41,182
Here.

Man's coat stays on
the driver's seat.

491

Makes them think
a guy lives here.

492
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:53,360
At night, curtains
closed, lights off.

493
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:56,063
Lights on is an
invitation. Right?

494
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:58,866
Someone knocks, we don't open.

495
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:01,001
Doors locked. Windows up.

00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:04,738

through the door handle

and fastened when
we're sleepin'.

498
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:12,846
You sleep up top. I'm
on the bottom. Got it?

499
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,049
- Got it.
- I do the shoppin'.

500
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:17,384
But you do the
dishes. You stay here.

501
00:45:17,418 --> 00:45:19,920
Don't let nobody see you, okay?

502
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:21,722
- All right.
- That's it.

503
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:27,895
But I need to go to the store.

504
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:29,863
Uh, didn't you hear what I said?

505
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,999
Your underwear is huge on me.

506
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:34,735
Would you prefer me to walk around
with 'em gathered in my ass?

507

[laughs]

508
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:42,409
This it?

509
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:44,912
It's for my niece.

510
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:47,314
Well, how do you like that?

511
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:50,818
I see you more than
I see my own family,

512
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,420
and I didn't even
know you had a niece.

513
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:08,202
Oh, come on, Patterson, don't give me this
shit about priority of resources, man.

514
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:12,072
This is a fucking
priority. Fuck!

515
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:23,317
Fuck!

516
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,785
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

517
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:30,924
You've been at this,
what, 30, 40 years?

518
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:33,027
Fifty.

519
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:36,930
Still gets you riled up, huh?

520
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,867
How the hell can it not?

521
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:46,440
Why don't they run?

522
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:52,279
You know? Because I would.

523
00:46:52,313 --> 00:46:54,348
Anything to get away
from that hellhole.

524
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:58,485
[chuckles] Fuck no. You...
you'd be locked in a basement.

525
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:05,025
No, you wouldn't
run. You'd stay.

526
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:10,598
Try to play the game. Survive.

527
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,411
What the fuck would
you live on out there?

528
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:16,470
Grass? Clover?

529
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:19,073
Best case scenario,

530
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:21,576
you're found and brought
right back into the system.

531
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:23,444
Then you'd run again.

532
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:26,246
[sighs]

533
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:29,584
Sorry.

534
00:47:32,654 --> 00:47:35,022
Most of these kids
are held captive

535
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:38,125
just a few miles from
where they grew up.

536
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:40,595
In their minds they
got nowhere to go.

537
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:45,899
And for a lot of
'em, that's true.

538
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:50,204
[footsteps approaching]

539
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:51,957
[female agent] Same
hair as in the basement.

540
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:54,875
Thank you.

541
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:18,666
Shouldn't we get...
Shouldn't we get rid of that?

542
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,137
Not an option. My mom gave it
to my brother before she died.

543
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:26,974
They find this... [chuckles]

544
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,510
they've found us anyway.

545
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:33,447
You fire it, you clean it.

546
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,397
I see his eyes all the time.

547
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:55,035
You kill someone 'cause
you wanna be free,

548
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,705
but then he still gets you.

549
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:02,176
How'd you learn to shoot?

550
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,051
This guy Cooper.

551
00:49:12,654 --> 00:49:15,088
My mom left me with him
when she went to work.

552
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,392
He was buildin' an armory.

553
00:49:20,762 --> 00:49:25,098
He always said if the world
went to shit... he'd be ready.

554
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:42,750
[music playing on radio]

555
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,545
Do you ever feel lonely?

556
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,615
Always.

557
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:42,276
[indistinct chatter]

558
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:52,252
[Sally yelling indistinct]

559
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:53,688
[woman] Just a few
gallons of gas.

560
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:55,088
- Oh, you want gas?
- Please, lady.

561
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:57,257
Well, bring your car!
I'll give you some gas.

562
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,302
I just want a few dollars.
It'd be better so I can buy...

563
00:50:59,326 --> 00:51:02,462
Oh, now you want money! Ask for
money! We're all struggling here!

564
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:03,397
[woman] I just wanna
take my kids to the...

565
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,432
[Sally] You got kids?
Go take care of them.

566
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:12,139
- See?
- Yeah, I see.

567
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:15,409
God... And what do
you want me to do?

568
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,879
- Well...
- Resources are so fucking scarce,

569
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:20,548
they're telling us to prioritize
only infants and toddlers.

570
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:22,650
Patterson, we can catch
these fucking guys.

571
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:24,886
It's you and Sterling,
Gerick. That is it.

572
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:29,189
If we don't bring 'em down now, they just
set up some place else and then what?

573
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:31,191
Ten more girls? Fifteen?

574
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,361
Trafficking will not go away

575
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:35,639
until people stop
buying, Gerick.

576
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:37,632
We know that. All right?

577
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,499
We get these guys
and someone else

578
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:41,468
is just gonna
satisfy the demand.

579
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,144
It could be your
daughter, Patterson.

580
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:56,450
[mutters]

581
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,621
[music playing on radio]

582
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:04,358
[boy] Hi. I saw
you earlier today.

583
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:10,364
Uh, I was just wondering
if you wanted to come over.

584
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:13,868
Uh, my mom's making pancakes,
so I just thought...

585
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:15,637
Thanks, but I don't have time.

586
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,139
M-maybe later? We're in the
pink RV over by the store.

587
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:25,145
Okay, well, maybe later.

588
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:27,715
Bye then. See ya.

589
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:03,918
[dramatic music playing]

590
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,509
[door closes]

591
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:29,944
Wow.

592
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:34,347
Who knew she could still shine.

593
00:53:48,996 --> 00:53:50,531
You said he would help.

594
00:53:50,565 --> 00:53:53,333
You don't read other
people's letters.

595
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:55,302
He's in fucking jail, so
how's he gonna help us?

596
00:53:55,335 --> 00:53:56,671
[inhales sharply]

597
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,775
What do you mean? "Us"?

598
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,878
You and me are not "us".

599
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:07,882
The only "us" I know
is me and my brother.

600
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,590
Why didn't you tell
me he was in jail?

601
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:17,825
He's getting out
of jail tomorrow.

602
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:20,360
'Cause of you, I can't be there.

603
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,365
You could've just told me.

604
00:54:25,398 --> 00:54:27,300
None of your fucking business.

605
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:52,527
Like looking for a
needle in a haystack.

606
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,662
A semi is no needle though.

607
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,898
It stands out pretty
much anywhere.

608
00:55:02,103 --> 00:55:03,604
If I was them...

609
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:09,944
I'd duck into someplace
familiar and just lay low.

610
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:13,748
And a young girl with a trucker
might stand out just enough

611
00:55:13,781 --> 00:55:15,950
for someone to
have taken notice.

612
00:55:17,118 --> 00:55:19,386
- Yeah.
- Wait.

613
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,556
You're not suggesting
we go analog

614
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,124
and go to every truck stop ever?

615
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,560
- 'Cause there's... there's many.
- There aren't that many.

616
00:55:25,593 --> 00:55:28,629
And a guy like this won't stray
far from his comfort zone.

617
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:30,998
You're driving. Let's go.

618
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:37,805
[music playing over headphones]

619
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:49,650
[tense music playing]

620
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:09,871
[shuddering breath]

621
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:41,769
[police siren chirps]

622
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:57,218
[cell phone ringing]

623
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,886
- Hello.
- [Dennis over phone] <i>Oh, shit.</i>

624
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,555
<i>I was worried about
you. I worked it out.</i>

625
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:02,933
<i>We gotta get the
girl back to them,</i>

626
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:04,491
<i>and they'll let us off the hook.</i>

627
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,560
<i>- Where you at?</i>
- Sherrigan's.

628
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:08,696
Heading to Arkansas
tomorrow like you told me.

629
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:11,232
<i>Okay. Okay.
Everything good there?</i>

630
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:16,771
- Yeah. All's good.
<i>- Great. Okay.</i>

631
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:19,874
- I love you.
- <i>I love you, too.</i>

632
00:57:19,907 --> 00:57:23,144
<i>Just keep the girl close.
She's our lifeline, sis.</i>

633
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,112
- Yeah.
- <i>Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

634
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:27,782
- Yeah.
- <i>I think we're gonna be okay.</i>

635
00:57:29,784 --> 00:57:31,085
[exhales sharply]

636
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,764
[dramatic music playing]

637
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:06,680
[cell phone ringing]

638
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:07,715
Hello.

639
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:08,783
Okay.

640
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:11,685
All right, we're on our way.

641
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,189
We got 'em. Take a left.

642
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:23,697
[grunts]

643
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:42,817
[groans] [exhales]

644
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:05,106
All right, all right,
all right, let's see.

645
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:09,343
Okay. Rock, okay.
It starts with rock.

646
01:00:09,376 --> 01:00:11,645
And then scissors cuts paper.

647
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:14,014
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

648
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:16,083
Rock, pa...

649
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:18,652
Rock, paper,
scissors, gun, shoot.

650
01:00:18,686 --> 01:00:21,322
[chuckles] Rock,
paper, scissors, shoot.

651
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:23,023
- What the heck?
- [chuckles]

652
01:00:23,057 --> 01:00:25,392
Okay, rock, shoot.

653
01:00:25,426 --> 01:00:27,394
[music playing on radio]

654
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:42,076
What you got there,
Yale? Toothbrush?

655
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:44,845
Yeah, I drink a lot of coffee.

656
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:46,080
[laughing]

657
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:49,683
Okay. All right.

658
01:00:49,717 --> 01:00:52,086
It's our fourth stop today.

659
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,719
What's gonna be
different about this one?

660
01:00:54,288 --> 01:00:55,990
You wanted field work.

661
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:57,892
This is the field.

662
01:00:57,925 --> 01:01:01,162
Sorry, it's not as sexy as
you thought it would be.

663
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:03,364
[grunts] Let's see what we find.

664
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:16,010
- [people chattering]
- [band playing blues music]

665
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:20,314
Shot of whiskey.

666
01:01:39,466 --> 01:01:41,702
[tense music playing]

667
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:56,317
[woman, outside RV] My youngest is sick
and we just need a few dollars for the bus.

668
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,920
You have kids, right? You
know what I'm goin' through.

669
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:08,862
Excuse me, sir. I have... I have a sick
mother at home and my car broke down.

670
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:11,899
I really... I just
need a few bucks.

671
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:18,839
You got kids? You got kids?
You got kids, don't you?

672
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:20,407
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, baby.

673
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:31,519
[sighs] Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.

674
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:33,053
- Okay, now.
- Thank you.

675
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,989
- Thank you. [cries]
- All right.

676
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:36,957
[woman] Thank you.

677
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,868
Do you ever feel lonely?

678
01:02:49,537 --> 01:02:52,206
Mm, no, not really.

679
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:58,012
Mm, how about, like,
when you're with people?

680
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,283
That maybe you'll
always be lonely

681
01:03:02,316 --> 01:03:05,819
because no one knows the
world the same as you do?

682
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:09,823
Uh...

683
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:20,067
I haven't seen any little girl.

684
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,269
I am so sure I

know where you wanna go.

864
01:17:01,822 --> 01:17:03,924

I'm running from.

01:17:16,103 --> 01:17:17,071
[Dennis over phone] <i>Yeah.</i>

868
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:18,272

869
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:19,273
You're at the house?

870
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:21,308
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm home.</i>

871
01:17:21,342 --> 01:17:23,110

about the girl, you know.</i>

873

to them tonight.</i>

me know what time.</i>

you'll get her home.</i>

879
01:17:50,437 --> 01:17:54,708
Dad used to beat us, and
Dennis took the brunt of it

880
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:57,077
for as long as he
could to protect me.

881
01:17:57,111 --> 01:18:01,415
And it... it hurt him. It
carved a piece out of him.

All right if I call you Sally?

905
01:22:01,488 --> 01:22:03,223
We're looking for a young girl.

906
01:22:04,726 --> 01:22:06,059
Dark hair.

907
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:10,063
Thought you might've seen her.

908
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:13,367
You and your partner asked around
the bar at Sherrigan's last night.

909
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:15,936
I haven't seen her, sir.

910
01:22:18,005 --> 01:22:20,508
What happened to your face?

911
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:22,710
Didn't I tell you I was
at the bar last night?

912
01:22:22,744 --> 01:22:25,345
Oh. [chuckles]

913
01:22:25,379 --> 01:22:28,015
And it looks like your
truck took a beating for ya.

914
01:22:29,517 --> 01:22:31,318
Was she there, too?

915
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:36,356
You know it, sir. She
and me, we're one.

916
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:39,359
Where are you from?

917
01:22:40,562 --> 01:22:43,430
Nowhere, and everywhere.

918
01:22:44,398 --> 01:22:46,233
That's America for you.

919
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:49,336
But you've been
here a long time.

920
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:54,007
Where do you live?

921
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:57,344
Right here, sir, in my truck.

922
01:22:57,377 --> 01:23:02,115

- Arkansas.

932
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:31,311
there are some bad people out,
wantin' to hurt that girl.

933
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:33,581
The police are
looking for a killer.

934
01:23:33,615 --> 01:23:36,116
That's not what I'm after.

935
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:37,585
I just want to help her

936
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:39,554
and whoever's trying
to be good to her.

937
01:23:39,587 --> 01:23:40,588
You understand?

938
01:23:42,824 --> 01:23:45,325
Here. This is my number.

939
01:23:47,695 --> 01:23:50,163
I don't trust the system
any more than you do,

940
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:53,568

You wanna tell me what
you're not telling them?

947
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:35,108
She's with the girl all right.

948
01:24:35,142 --> 01:24:38,513
But that lady trucker's
not who we're looking for.

949
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,782
I think the girl was
safe here with her.

950
01:24:40,815 --> 01:24:45,152
Last thing we need is a bunch of cops
running after them with guns drawn.

Oh, we'll keep an eye on her.

952

Let her guide us to whoever
she's running away from.

- Utica?
- Her brother.

Petty crimes mostly, worse
up through the years.

959

He was transporting
duffels and got caught.

960
01:25:16,249 --> 01:25:19,186
Five years
incarcerated at Utica.

961
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:21,656
Same place Paul
McKinney did time.

962
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:24,458
That's too much
of a coincidence.

963

in the same place as...

01:32:06,327 --> 01:32:08,129
I'm sorry I can't
get you anything.

1036
01:32:08,162 --> 01:32:10,564
You know, nobody's been here
for the past couple of years

1037
01:32:10,598 --> 01:32:12,266
since... since our dad died.

1038
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:14,035
That's fine.

1039
01:32:30,117 --> 01:32:31,185
[Sally chuckles]

1040
01:32:33,754 --> 01:32:35,589
That. Don't you touch that.

1041
01:32:35,623 --> 01:32:37,691
- Get your paws off my trophy.
- [laughing]

1042
01:32:37,725 --> 01:32:39,894
[Dennis and Sally laughing]

1043
01:32:47,835 --> 01:32:49,336
[sighs]

1044
01:32:51,038 --> 01:32:52,106
[chuckles]

1045
01:32:56,977 --> 01:32:58,979
You know, I was... I was...

1046
01:32:59,013 --> 01:33:00,915
I was happy when you got away.

1047
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:03,250
- I was.
- I know.

1048
01:33:06,954 --> 01:33:10,224
I didn't have to... I didn't
have to think about...

1049
01:33:10,257 --> 01:33:13,294
listening to something
happen to you every night.

1050
01:33:29,743 --> 01:33:31,812
It's not as bad as I thought.

1051
01:33:33,681 --> 01:33:36,717
I mean, the mess is as bad
as I thought it'd be, but...

1052
01:33:44,091 --> 01:33:45,359
It doesn't scare me anymore.

1053
01:33:46,293 --> 01:33:47,928
Well, that's good to hear.

1054
01:33:49,063 --> 01:33:52,066
[music playing over radio]

1055
01:33:52,099 --> 01:33:55,302
Should we, uh...
should we get going?

1056
01:33:55,336 --> 01:33:57,404
Sure. Where?

1057
01:34:04,879 --> 01:34:06,280
You're right about me, you know.

1058
01:34:08,949 --> 01:34:10,050
What?

1059
01:34:11,318 --> 01:34:13,187
I know nothing about this.

1060
01:34:15,956 --> 01:34:17,858
Grew up with a silver spoon.

1061
01:34:18,959 --> 01:34:21,462
Completely disconnected.

1062
01:34:21,495 --> 01:34:23,430
And the strongest
memory I have of my mom

1063
01:34:23,464 --> 01:34:27,368
was her picture hanging
above my crib. [chuckles]

1064
01:34:27,401 --> 01:34:31,005
And I joined the bureau so I
could mean something to someone.

1065
01:34:32,907 --> 01:34:34,909
Can't say that's working out.

1066
01:34:38,245 --> 01:34:39,680
Why'd you join?

1067
01:34:40,247 --> 01:34:41,782
[clicks tongue]

1068
01:34:41,815 --> 01:34:43,484
Doesn't matter why I joined.

1069
01:34:43,518 --> 01:34:45,986
Only matters what I do with it.

1070
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,888
[cell phone ringing]

1071
01:34:52,893 --> 01:34:53,928
Yeah.

1072
01:34:55,062 --> 01:34:56,463
What?

1073
01:34:56,497 --> 01:34:59,700
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1074
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:04,438
Hospital has Sally on
file. Over 30 years ago.

1075
01:35:04,471 --> 01:35:08,842
Numerous ER visits,
various, um... accidents.

1076
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:10,744
She was brought
in by her brother.

1077
01:35:10,778 --> 01:35:12,213
There's a home address.

1078
01:35:16,917 --> 01:35:22,189
Uh... I don't wanna
give her back.

1079
01:35:22,223 --> 01:35:24,024
I wanna buy her out.

1080
01:35:26,193 --> 01:35:27,361
The girl?

1081
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:28,963
Leila, yeah.

1082
01:35:31,899 --> 01:35:34,301
Well, what are you
gonna do with her?

1083
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:37,004
Where are you gonna
get the money?

1084
01:35:37,037 --> 01:35:38,540
I have some money.

1085
01:35:38,573 --> 01:35:39,907
How much?

1086
01:35:41,976 --> 01:35:43,477
How'd you get it?

1087
01:35:43,511 --> 01:35:47,081
Enough. I should have
some left over, too.

1088
01:35:47,114 --> 01:35:49,283
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you get it?

1089
01:35:49,316 --> 01:35:50,384
[Sally clicks tongue]

1090
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:54,154
How'd you get the money, Sal?

1091
01:35:55,089 --> 01:35:56,757
Sold my trailer.

1092
01:36:11,905 --> 01:36:13,307
She needs us.

1093
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:16,777
The way we needed each other.

1094
01:36:19,246 --> 01:36:22,216
You mean like a... Like
a family or something?

1095
01:36:28,455 --> 01:36:29,957
Well... [chuckles]

1096
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:31,325
Well, that would take me

1097
01:36:31,358 --> 01:36:34,161
just a little bit of
time to get used to.

1098
01:36:34,194 --> 01:36:35,362
You know?

1099
01:36:37,998 --> 01:36:39,099
Yeah.

1100
01:36:46,206 --> 01:36:47,908
[sighs]

1101
01:36:50,311 --> 01:36:52,179
All right.

1102
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:55,249
We do this, you gotta let me
take care of it, all right?

1103
01:36:55,282 --> 01:36:56,618
I'm gonna bring 'em the cash.

1104
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:59,186
Pay. Done.

1105
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:03,357
All right. Okay.

1106
01:37:07,428 --> 01:37:09,029
Where's the bathroom?

1107
01:37:09,063 --> 01:37:11,432
We're-we're gonna take
a little ride. Uh...

1108
01:37:11,465 --> 01:37:15,436
No. No. Leila stays with me.

1109
01:37:15,469 --> 01:37:18,372
No, that's not how it works,
sis. I gotta bring her.

1110
01:37:18,405 --> 01:37:21,141
You-you could've taken her to
the police for all they know.

1111
01:37:21,175 --> 01:37:23,344
All right. I'll go then.

1112
01:37:23,377 --> 01:37:25,312
No, Sal. Sal. [chuckles]

1113
01:37:25,346 --> 01:37:27,549
If she's going, I'm going.
Uh, Leila, let's go.

1114
01:37:27,582 --> 01:37:29,517
- Sal.
- I still have to pee.

1115
01:37:29,551 --> 01:37:31,251
It's-it's just right here.

1116
01:37:31,285 --> 01:37:34,088
- [sighs] Useless...
- I'll turn the truck around.

1117
01:37:34,121 --> 01:37:35,222
It's just a bad idea.

1118
01:37:35,255 --> 01:37:36,390
Get out of your pajamas.

1119
01:37:36,423 --> 01:37:37,559
It's time to go.

1120
01:37:42,463 --> 01:37:44,331
[engine starts]

1121
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:51,105
- [beeping] - [automated
voice] <i>Joining conference now.</i>

1122
01:37:51,138 --> 01:37:52,339
Sally's here.

1123
01:37:52,373 --> 01:37:54,274
Hi, Sally.

1124
01:37:54,308 --> 01:37:56,076
[over radio] <i>Dolly's

That's right, Rose.
Pattie's here, too.

<i>She's slow as a little
turtle, just like you, Sally.</i>

1127
01:38:01,616 --> 01:38:04,451
Come on, baby doll, get with it.

1128

- [Dolly] <i>I'm just sayin'.</i>
- [Rose] <i>Shut up, Dolly.</i>

<i>Where are you headed?</i>

1131
01:38:11,559 --> 01:38:15,129
Remember that old
airport? Southeast?

1132
01:38:15,162 --> 01:38:17,331
Hell yeah, I
remember that place.

1133
01:38:17,364 --> 01:38:21,101
Yeah, me too, I was gonna be a flight
attendant before I broke my teeth.

1134

[women laughing]

1135
01:38:24,204 --> 01:38:30,043
Just wanna tell ya, it's good to
know you ladies are out there.

1136

We're always out
here. [grunts]

Let's go!

1140
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:51,432
You look fucked up.

1141
01:38:51,465 --> 01:38:53,434
Huh? Oh, yeah?

1142
01:38:53,467 --> 01:38:56,336
Oh, yeah. Freezing out there.

1143
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:59,206
Well, Leila found something.
I think you're gonna like it.

1144
01:39:03,277 --> 01:39:05,979
[grunts] Sal, what
are you doin'?

1145
01:39:07,649 --> 01:39:09,249
[panting]

1146
01:39:09,283 --> 01:39:10,718
What are you doin'?

1147
01:39:10,752 --> 01:39:13,120
It's-it's-it's-it's the dress

1148
01:39:13,153 --> 01:39:15,489
that dad bought you
for your 13th birthday.

1149
01:39:15,523 --> 01:39:17,324
I thought you'd like it.

1150
01:39:17,357 --> 01:39:20,227
- I thought you'd like it, Sal.
- Take it off. Take it off, Leila.

1151
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:21,639
[Dennis] Sal... I-I thought
you'd think it was cute.

1152
01:39:21,663 --> 01:39:22,630
I thought you'd like it. I...

1153
01:39:22,664 --> 01:39:24,498
- I don't!
- All right, all right,

1154
01:39:24,532 --> 01:39:27,602
- I fucked up. I'm sorry!
- Take it off!

1155

[tense music playing]

1156
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:17,519
[Finley] It's clear.

1157
01:40:37,872 --> 01:40:39,072
Hair.

1158
01:40:40,808 --> 01:40:42,276
They were here.

1159
01:40:44,478 --> 01:40:45,479
We missed 'em.

1160
01:40:48,282 --> 01:40:52,152
Shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit!

1161
01:41:02,764 --> 01:41:05,533
[vehicle approaching]

1162
01:41:17,745 --> 01:41:18,813
I'll go.

1163
01:41:34,227 --> 01:41:35,462
Where's the girl?

1164
01:41:35,495 --> 01:41:37,130
I wanna buy her out.

1165
01:41:38,866 --> 01:41:40,400
That wasn't the deal.

1166
01:41:40,434 --> 01:41:42,336
I'll pay more than
the going rate.

1167
01:41:43,705 --> 01:41:44,672
Let me see her.

1168
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:45,740
No.

1169
01:41:49,343 --> 01:41:51,378
- [Dennis] Come on.
- [Sally] Dennis!

1170
01:41:53,815 --> 01:41:55,382
I have the cash.

1171
01:41:57,719 --> 01:41:59,486
But I need to know
we're cut clean.

1172
01:42:00,555 --> 01:42:03,223
My brother, me, the girl.

1173
01:42:03,256 --> 01:42:04,859
And we don't see you anymore.

1174
01:42:08,395 --> 01:42:11,899
Sure. You bought it, you own it.

1175
01:42:22,977 --> 01:42:26,446
Really? You think I'm just
gonna let you take the girl?

1176
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,616
How do I know you won't talk?

1177
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:31,284
'Cause I'm just as
guilty as everybody else.

1178
01:42:33,655 --> 01:42:35,599
- That's it, just get the girl and let's get out of here!
- [woman yells indistinct]

1179
01:42:35,623 --> 01:42:37,959
Don't hurt my sister! I
said, don't hurt my sister!

01:42:37,992 --> 01:42:39,694
- [man] Back here!
- [Dennis] Hey.

1181
01:42:39,727 --> 01:42:40,928
Get the girl and let's go!

1182
01:42:40,962 --> 01:42:42,462
- Hey!

01:42:43,998 --> 01:42:44,899
- Hey!
- Fuck!

1185
01:42:44,932 --> 01:42:47,300
- [Sally grunting]
- [Dennis] Hey! Easy.

1186
01:42:47,334 --> 01:42:49,336
- Den...
- Hey! Get off her!

1187
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:50,547
- Get off her! Hey!
- Fuck you!

1188
01:42:50,571 --> 01:42:52,272
- Hey, go easy!
- Get him!

1189
01:42:52,305 --> 01:42:53,608

[body thuds]

1191
01:42:55,409 --> 01:42:57,477
[woman gasps] Dennis, what?

1192
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:03,885
I said... I told him
not to hurt my sister.

1193
01:43:03,918 --> 01:43:05,987
You said to make it look real!

1194
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:09,289
Not that real! I said
don't hurt my sister!

1195
01:43:09,322 --> 01:43:12,593
[woman] You didn't have
to kill him! [crying]

1196
01:43:12,627 --> 01:43:15,362
[Dennis] Why couldn't you just
get the fucking kid, Claire? Huh?

1197
01:43:17,431 --> 01:43:19,399
I told you exactly
where she was!

1198
01:43:19,433 --> 01:43:21,368
- Now get in the van!
- [Leila] Let go!

1199
01:43:21,401 --> 01:43:22,502
- Dennis?
- Let go of me!

1200
01:43:22,537 --> 01:43:23,547
You-you weren't
supposed to see this.

1201
01:43:23,571 --> 01:43:25,973
- No, Sal. Sal, listen, Sal...
- Let go of me!

1202
01:43:26,007 --> 01:43:27,542
- Dennis...
- Let go of me!

1203
01:43:27,575 --> 01:43:30,410
Stop it! Sal, you weren't
supposed to see this.

1204
01:43:30,444 --> 01:43:32,345
Sal. Sal, no! Let her go!

1205
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:33,815
Let her go! Let her go.

[grunts]

1207
01:43:34,982 --> 01:43:37,885
I was just gonna do it for a
bit till we got on our feet.

1208
01:43:37,919 --> 01:43:40,454
Sal, you were not
supposed to see this.

1209
01:43:40,487 --> 01:43:43,558
Get in the fucking van, Claire!

1210
01:43:43,591 --> 01:43:45,225
[whimpers]

1211
01:43:46,894 --> 01:43:48,428
Sal...

1212
01:43:48,462 --> 01:43:49,564
Please...

1213
01:43:49,597 --> 01:43:51,599
Claire, get in the van.

1214
01:43:54,602 --> 01:43:56,403
- Please.
- Let me get rid of her, okay?

1215
01:43:56,436 --> 01:43:57,839
Just let me get rid of her,

1216
01:43:57,872 --> 01:44:01,274
and-and we get back
to us, Sal, I promise.

1217
01:44:01,308 --> 01:44:03,276
You'll see, it's gonna be fine.

1218
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:04,946
No, Sally!

1219
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:06,514
Sal, it's gonna be okay.

1220
01:44:06,547 --> 01:44:08,516
Sally! Please!

1221

- [shushing]
- [muffled screaming]

1222
01:44:11,418 --> 01:44:13,888
No!

1223
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:20,460
Dennis, stop! Stop! Don't!

1224
01:44:23,798 --> 01:44:24,999
Leila!

1225
01:44:25,032 --> 01:44:27,835

1227
01:44:31,539 --> 01:44:32,807
[Sally] Leila!

Leila. Leila.

1232
01:45:06,974 --> 01:45:08,910
Sally?

1233
01:45:08,943 --> 01:45:10,477
[Dennis] Come on, Sal!

1234
01:45:13,114 --> 01:45:14,481
Come on, Sal!

1235
01:45:14,515 --> 01:45:16,050
Fly away with me.

1236
01:45:18,019 --> 01:45:20,420
Come fly away with me.

1237
01:45:20,453 --> 01:45:21,956
We'll go to Mars...

1238
01:45:21,989 --> 01:45:26,093
Saturn, and we'll go
to Jupiter and China.

1239
01:45:26,127 --> 01:45:28,863
Anywhere but here. We
get the hell outta here.

- [grunts]
- Kids... Sal?

1244
01:45:38,139 --> 01:45:39,406
No, Dennis.

1245
01:45:40,107 --> 01:45:41,474
They are kids.

1246
01:45:42,677 --> 01:45:44,512
Not us.

1247
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,882
How much you sell 'em for?

1248
01:45:47,915 --> 01:45:50,417
- No.
- How much a job?

1249
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:52,119
- No.
- How many times a day?

1250
01:45:52,153 --> 01:45:54,088
[groans] No, you-you
got it all wrong.

1251
01:45:54,121 --> 01:45:55,890
Sal, I do it for
you. I do it for you!

1252
01:45:55,923 --> 01:45:58,059
- No!
- I... Everything I do...

1253
01:46:04,532 --> 01:46:05,967
I want you to tell me...

1254
01:46:07,535 --> 01:46:10,605
what-what that girl does
for you that I don't do.

1255

[exhales]

1256
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,742
What do you owe her?

1257
01:46:14,775 --> 01:46:16,644
[Leila] She doesn't
owe me anything.

1258
01:46:38,065 --> 01:46:39,600
[dramatic music playing]

1259
01:46:39,634 --> 01:46:40,735
[Dennis] Sal...

1260
01:46:42,536 --> 01:46:43,871
Hey, Sal.

1261
01:47:14,902 --> 01:47:16,503
Let's get you in the car.

1262
01:47:16,537 --> 01:47:17,705
Watch your head, all right?

1263
01:47:22,009 --> 01:47:23,010
Hey.

1264
01:47:24,545 --> 01:47:25,846
[door closes]

1265
01:47:30,885 --> 01:47:32,119
Worried about him?

1266
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:37,825
Never gonna stop.

1267
01:47:40,294 --> 01:47:42,530
Well, if we can get
him to help us...

1268
01:47:44,031 --> 01:47:46,033
maybe we can catch the big guy.

1269
01:47:48,903 --> 01:47:51,706
Promise you'll take
care of those kids.

1270
01:47:51,739 --> 01:47:55,710
Oh, don't worry.
I'll see to them.

1271
01:47:55,743 --> 01:47:57,678
That's what gets me
up in the morning.

1272
01:48:03,818 --> 01:48:08,923
Well, you... probably
better get going.

1273
01:48:08,956 --> 01:48:10,758
Local police are on their way.

1274
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:14,662
We have your statement, so...

1275
01:48:20,668 --> 01:48:22,036
Have a nice ride.

1276
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:32,947
[engine starts]

1277
01:48:40,254 --> 01:48:42,123
You know, we're gonna
get in trouble for this.

1278
01:48:43,224 --> 01:48:45,159
I'm gonna get in
trouble for this.

1279
01:48:45,192 --> 01:48:46,694
You didn't know shit about it.

1280
01:48:48,029 --> 01:48:50,498
It's not your fault
if I went rogue.

1281
01:48:54,335 --> 01:48:56,070
You're still an asshole.

1282
01:49:00,074 --> 01:49:01,175
To you.

1283
01:49:17,091 --> 01:49:18,225
Seatbelt?
