1
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,380
"Celtic" is in the water.

2
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,540
Thanks, I needed that.

3
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,380
This is not a true story,

4
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,780
except for all the facts.

5
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,620
America at a crossroads,

6
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,220
a presidential election
looms as Black Lives Matter

7
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,420
protests around the country,
cry out for justice.

8
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,100
You're watching the nightly news

9
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,300
and tonight we have a special report
from the ground at one of those protests.

10
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,900
Terence, over to you.

11
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,780
I'm Terence Williams
on the field.

12
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,780
I'm here with Grace
Anderson and Ashley Porter,

13
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,740
two friends who told me they joined
the protest this evening.

14
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,420
Grace, what do you hope to
achieve by being part of this?

15
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,340
We want social justice, we want equity,
there's oppression, there's inequality.

16
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,336
We've got an orange man Tweeting
out of his ass.

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,120
It's his supporters that are
domestic terrorists and Nazis.

18
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,013
 Terence,

19
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,100
I think the question that everyone wants
to know is how are they all feeling?

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,460
<i>No justice, No Peace!</i>

21
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,340
One final question,
just how are you feeling?

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,376
How are we feeling? What kind of
question is that? We're outraged.

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,260
We want change! We want our voices heard!

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,540
<i>Nazi Tump supporters!</i>

25
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,980
There appears to be a fight
just brewing over to the right.

26
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:28,816
- Rachel?
- Cut away from Terence.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,600
Cut away from Terence.
Thank you, Terence.

28
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,700
Well, as you can see,
there's some understandable passion,

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,710
but these are mostly
peaceful protests that

30
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:41,256
show signs of hope and
change for America.

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,920
Up next, you won't believe
what Donald Trump just tweeted.

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,960
<i>This is the police, this is an
unlawful assembly. Please disperse.</i>

33
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,840
<i>This is the police, this is an
unlawful assembly.</i>

34
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,960
<i>Please disperse.</i>

35
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,720
I think I got a viral video.
I'm gonna trend.

36
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,893
Let me see.

37
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,160
<i>This Is the police. This is an
unlawful assembly. Please disperse.</i>

38
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,560
- You can't post that video, Grace.
- Why not?

39
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,080
Because it'll make the protest look bad.

40
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,160
But everybody hates Trump supporters,
it's like justice.

41
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,680
Well, yeah, but it's bad optics.

42
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,880
Look, most people are too ignorant to
understand complex moral issues.

43
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,800
You have to withhold some things for their
own good. We choose truth over facts.

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,393
I suppose you're right.

45
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:48,244
I've gotta get to work.
I'll call you later.

46
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,501
Have a safe flight.

47
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,300
Thanks.

48
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,648
And Grace,
we're on the right side of history.

49
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,760
Right side of history.

50
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,760
Damn. I love that video, though.

51
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,733
My friends...

52
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,133
it's time

53
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,680
to fucking party!

54
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,240
Thank you, babe.
You did a great job tonight.

55
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,280
Hey Kitty, showtime.

56
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,020
Don't judge me. I'm doing this
to pay off my college debt.

57
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,480
Good evening.

58
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,664
For those of you who have not
been here before,

59
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:59,436
I'm Lorenzo,

60
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,600
my pronouns are he/him to you,
but she/her to your sister,

61
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,920
and that way everyone's
happy, aren't they?

62
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
I have a very special
treat for you all tonight.

63
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,120
We have a new star right
here in the red box.

64
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,960
Please, everyone, give a very,
very warm welcome, to Kitty!

65
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,520
Sorry, sorry. Good news, though.

66
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,900
We're gonna have to move the party
somewhere a little bit more private.

67
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,360
But you're all invited.
Lorenzo will give you the details.

68
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,256
Yeah!

69
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:28,665
Let's do this!

70
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,160
Let's do this.

71
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,920
John Belushi died in the next bungalow.

72
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,120
That's so sad.
Who's John Belushi?

73
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,560
He was a comedian.
He had some demons.

74
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,053
- Prick.
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,300
Get out!

76
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,360
Everybody out!
Party's over!

77
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,960
Get out, you freeloading fuckers!

78
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,513
Out!

79
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,420
Get out. Get out. Get out.

80
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,180
Go! Get out.

81
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:01,855
Fuckers.

82
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,620
Oh, God.

83
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,123
Please, don't.

84
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,063
Do you wanna talk?

85
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,013
No.

86
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,833
I wanna drive.

87
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,800
I'll be right back.

88
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,340
Yo, who are you?

89
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,364
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You know me.

90
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:09,609
What the fuck?

91
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,985
Yo, good to see you.

92
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,320
We good now, okay?

93
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,003
You know me. Jesus.

94
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,680
2, 3, 4.
Okay.

95
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,493
Are you okay?

96
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,380
I will be.

97
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:44,620
Actually, I am a royal fuck up.

98
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,473
Aren't we all?

99
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,112
You have no idea.

100
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:53,184
No one can fuck up the
way that I fuck up.

101
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,456
Tell me how I can help you.

102
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,880
I don't deserve help.

103
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,973
Why would you say that?

104
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,600
Do you know who I am?

105
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,680
Not really, they told me you were VIP.
All connected to the government.

106
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,756
Yeah, well my father,

107
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,980
everything he built,
his life, dreams and ambitions,

108
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,800
I just fucking ruined it all.

109
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,580
Oh!

110
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm so sorry for putting you through
this shit, you do not deserve it.

111
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,383
I've been through worse.

112
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,533
You are beautiful.

113
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,320
It doesn't matter what you've done.

114
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,401
I didn't do anything wrong.

115
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:08,944
My privacy has being violated.

116
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,840
Ever happened to you?

117
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,520
Sometimes, pictures.

118
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,440
Your family found out?
Your mom, your dad?

119
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,920
I don't give a shit about my dad.

120
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,320
Oh.

121
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:28,855
That's sad.

122
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,513
I love my dad.

123
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,880
You got any brother and sisters?

124
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,370
I wish I did, but no.
You?

125
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,120
My sister and my mommy

126
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,800
died in a car accident
when I was little.

127
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,733
I'm so sorry.

128
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,023
Yeah.

129
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,480
I just remember this hand,

130
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,636
in the hospital, it was my brother's hand,
he was four years old.

131
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,880
He was holding my hand,
he was just going...

132
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:16,755
I love you.

133
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,738
I love you.

134
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,857
I love you.

135
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,480
And then, it was just me, Beau,

136
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,000
and dad against everything,
against the world.

137
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,080
Was it hard growing
up without your mom?

138
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,800
Well, I didn't get a choice.
Dad remarried.

139
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,000
She's my mom, not my mommy.

140
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,703
Yeah.

141
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,720
And then every year
after the crash,

142
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,640
we go to this tiny little house in
Nantucket, 'Sconset Beach.

143
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,040
Just the family,
immediate family, nobody else.

144
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,160
And it's the only time I feel like,
um, it's the only time I feel like,

145
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,600
not throwing myself off a cliff.

146
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,100
It's not the same though,
since my brother died.

147
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,823
When did he die?

148
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,600
Four years ago, brain tumor.

149
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm so sorry. It's horrible.

150
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,270
He, he was, you would've liked him.
He was the good one.

151
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,256
He was, uh, he was my best friend.
We did everything together.

152
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,080
He was like the conscience of
the family. And after 911, he,

153
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,600
he joined the National Guard.
And then he was an Attorney general.

154
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,212
And every single person
thought he was gonna be

155
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,080
the President of the United
States one day, everybody.

156
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,480
And now I'm all dad
has left from mommy.

157
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,330
And I just wanna make him proud.

158
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,510
I just, I want make him proud.

159
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,590
Oh, bingo. Fuck.

160
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,066
So...

161
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,070
I'm the one, I am the one who brings
in all the deals. I am the one,

162
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,426
I'm the one that provides everybody a
future in this family.

163
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,730
Aunts, uncles,
they have futures because of me.

164
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,533
So what happened?

165
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm a drug addict.

166
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,760
Ever tried rehab?

167
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,240
No. It doesn't work on me.
Tried five, six times. Doesn't work.

168
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,880
Isn't that like the first step to recovery?
Admitting your mistakes?

169
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,520
I did join the, the Naval Reserve,

170
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,540
but I was thrown out on my first day
of having too much cocaine in my blood.

171
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,460
I fucked up. Do you wanna
hear about another fuck up?

172
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,413
I do.

173
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,060
After my brother died,

174
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,580
the most enormous bender you
could possibly imagine.

175
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,033
And I...

176
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,420
divorce my wife,

177
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,413
and then I fall
in love...

178
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,123
with his wife.

179
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,060
His wife? How does that happen?

180
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,300
Well, no, no. It wasn't planned.
It was the grief.

181
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,980
You know,
grief brings you together.

182
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,820
And she was the only one who knew what
I was going through. So we just kind of...

183
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,563
Fuck up.

184
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,660
Do you believe everything in
life happens for a reason?

185
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,220
No. I believe shit happens
and we make our own destiny.

186
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,233
What's so funny?

187
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,833
Oh...

188
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,260
my brother would never
have fucked my wife.

189
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,680
Let's go for a walk.

190
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,400
It would be nice if you
told me where we're going.

191
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,080
Oh, I am so sorry.

192
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm not entirely sure yet.

193
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,920
Look, so you don't live up to your
parent's image of perfection, who does?

194
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,200
I sure as hell don't.
I hate my father.

195
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,073
He's a self-righteous,
judgmental prick.

196
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:24,264
He's everything that's
wrong with this country.

197
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,760
If he doesn't like me, that's his problem.

198
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,920
Is he rich and powerful?

199
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,440
Worse, he's a lawyer.

200
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,333
Oh, god.

201
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,296
You know, just because you don't live
up to your father's image of perfection

202
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,960
doesn't mean you have to
be so self-destructive.

203
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,440
What I told you before,
it's just the shit before the storm.

204
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,800
It's the coming hurricane
I can't tell you about.

205
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,820
Uh, can I help you?
How did you get in here?

206
00:25:22,844 --> 00:25:23,944
Tyrone?

207
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,640
Don't worry, honey.
I know these guys.

208
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,780
We're gonna need you to come with us, sir.

209
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,320
You just gimme a little minute to
freshen up and I'll be right with you.

210
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,080
Like father, like son.

211
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,240
You wait in the bungalow,
I'll be right back.

212
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,903
It's the hurricane.

213
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,990
Dad?

214
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:43,845
Hunt.

215
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,880
Breaking my heart, son.

216
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,840
Holy shit. My life just got
a whole lot more interesting.

217
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,220
But since I was a young boy, I wanted
to be President of the United States.

218
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,300
It's my fourth time
running for the office.

219
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,900
I spent 120 years in the Senate,
a bunch of years as vice president.

220
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,380
I'm tired. It's my last chance.

221
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,870
I tried to help you your entire life,
 covered for your weaknesses,

222
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,210
and somehow now at the climax of my
campaign, the worst possible moment,

223
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,370
of my most important year,

224
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,770
how the fuck did your
laptop end up at the FBI?

225
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,501
I thought they'd
refuse to accept it.

226
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:07,706
It's all worked out for now.

227
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,930
But if this blows up,
they may change their minds.

228
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,670
So tell me, how a goddamn repair shop
got your laptop and brought it to the FBI?

229
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,070
It got water damage.
I took it to be fixed.

230
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,236
Water damage?
What were you swimming with it?

231
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:25,527
I forgot to pick it up.

232
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:26,818
Forgot to pick it up?

233
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,315
I was so busy with
your campaign.

234
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,194
Oh, come on, man.

235
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,810
What kind of a moron forgets to
pick up his laptop at a repair shop?

236
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,210
Were you high or drunk?

237
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:42,134
- No, dad. I'm sober.
- Bullshit.

238
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,610
Look, I didn't know they could
take the data off the drive.

239
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,556
I thought I had a
right to privacy.

240
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:49,546
Well, they tell me,

241
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,810
according to the contract that you
signed with this repair shop,

242
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,170
they legally own the hard drive,

243
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,770
because you forgot to
pick it up after 90 days.

244
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,843
Actually, it's, um,

245
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,404
it's two laptops.

246
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:11,698
Two?

247
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,463
Oh my god.

248
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,730
I wish I could help you, son.
I just wish I could...

249
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,850
smack some sense into you.

250
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,794
You're with a woman.
Another stripper?

251
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:37,454
No, a friend.

252
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,903
Oh.

253
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,800
Just make sure you don't get your
friend pregnant like the last stripper.

254
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,240
Has the judge ruled on
maternity, yet?

255
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,941
Uh, next month.

256
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,856
Have you tried to
pay the woman off?

257
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,600
No, I'm just trying to run her into
the ground with legal expenses.

258
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,290
But she won't give up.

259
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,557
Just make sure you
never admit to it.

260
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:03,928
Yeah.

261
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,536
Just remember,

262
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,654
family comes first

263
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,306
over everything.

264
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:13,794
Dad, I'm so sorry.

265
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,750
I don't want to hear
another, sorry. Okay?

266
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,190
You're all outta sorrys.

267
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,710
Look, you're my son.
You're an addict.

268
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,510
So you lie, compulsively.
I get it.

269
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:49,230
And I've been patient with you, but I'm
going to ask you a question now, Hunt.

270
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,870
And I need you to tell me the
God's honest truth, no lies.

271
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,550
I don't care how bad it is,
but I need you to tell me the truth.

272
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,750
Because if you don't tell
me the truth, I can't fix it.

273
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,510
And everything will be lost.

274
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,350
Everything.
Including my patience with you.

275
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,102
Do you understand this?

276
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,379
Yes, sir.

277
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:17,958
- Your word as a Biden.
- My word as a Biden.

278
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,930
I want to know everything that's on
that laptop that can ruin my erection.

279
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,859
Every single detail.

280
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,786
No need to be diplomatic
now, son.

281
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,790
Just, gve it to me straight.

282
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,923
I have, uh,

283
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,530
A lot of selfies, naked selfies,

284
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,050
Narcissist, not scandalous.

285
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,850
What else?

286
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,370
Uh, some intimate
video with my girlfriend

287
00:32:00,994 --> 00:32:02,294
...s

288
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,806
Girlfriends?

289
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:08,753
There were some, um,
parties.

290
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,830
Some of them are hookers.

291
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,326
That's already in the GOP Senate report.
It's only a footnote.

292
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,310
Nobody reads footnotes.

293
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,670
I can't seem to find anything
but positive stuff on the Bidens.

294
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,550
That's because you're using
Google and the mainstream media.

295
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,160
You have to use the alternative
search engine. Here, let me show you.

296
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,240
You sound like an alt-right,
white supremacist.

297
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,160
Yeah, Kitty. I'm the black
face of white supremacy.

298
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,080
What about these, uh,
pictures of your niece?

299
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,336
She's my niece. What, am I not allowed to
have pictures of my family members?

300
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,240
Family members? Come on. I'm not even
going to get into it with you on that.

301
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,056
Kathleen doesn't even want you
around your own kids because you're,

302
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,280
you're watching porn and
taking drugs all day.

303
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,336
Kathleen is like one of
those idiots on the internet

304
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,563
who thinks I try to
murder people in Ukraine.

305
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:14,024
Oh goddammit, Hunt. Come on.

306
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,760
We're living in the world of that, uh,
that thing. What do they call it? Um,

307
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,061
"I'm with her."

308
00:33:20,086 --> 00:33:20,963
"Me too."

309
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:25,615
Yeah, they're already on
me for that Tara Reade.

310
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,244
She was one, uh,

311
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,980
one sweet smelling young lady.

312
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,520
You have eight women with claims
against you, dad.

313
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,200
Lying dog-faced pony soldiers.
I don't even remember those girls.

314
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,020
How do you know those girls?

315
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,788
Our line is just that
you're old-school and you

316
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:48,154
need to respect people's
boundaries a little more.

317
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:51,544
Bidens are affectionate.

318
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,906
You need to be
more careful too, dad.

319
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:56,754
Oh, come on,
I could be out in the middle of

320
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:58,716
Fifth Avenue with Tara
Reade and the media would

321
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,820
still be talking about
Trump's grabbing pussy.

322
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,060
What about your affairs?

323
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,651
Cheating on your wife with
Hallie is already old news.

324
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:10,864
We've survived that.

325
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,500
Anyone else?

326
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:18,214
Hallie's sister.

327
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,833
When?

328
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:24,115
When I was with Hallie.

329
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,450
You fucked Beau's widow and
her sister at the same time?

330
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,130
Jesus Christ, Hunter!

331
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,570
You know, when I think of your
brother's character, his integrity,

332
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,992
you dishonor his memory.

333
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:41,670
I know.

334
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,959
Beau wouldn't make porno videos
with hookers and crack pipes.

335
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,314
No, he wouldn't.

336
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,865
He wouldn't disgrace
women, godammit.

337
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,934
It should've be me
that got cancer.

338
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,065
Come on now,
don't say that-

339
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,575
Or died in the crash with mommy.

340
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,170
Oh, come on man. Stop it. Stop it.
Bidens don't wallow in self pity.

341
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,310
Look, I suffered a hell of a
lot more than you ever will.

342
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,470
I marched in the civil rights movement.
I attended a black college.

343
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,230
I was arrested with Nelson Mandela.

344
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,110
- I'll never forget Corn Pop.
- Huh?

345
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,270
He was a bad dude. No joke.

346
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,310
He wouldn't wear a bathing
cap in the pool. So I,

347
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,640
I faced him down with
a six foot chain.

348
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,155
- Dad.
- What?

349
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,665
We're talking about suffering?

350
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:50,112
Yeah. Look, here's the deal.

351
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:54,264
Do you see me
wallowing in self pity,

352
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,620
crying over spilt butter?
- No.

353
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,920
Okay now, come on. I need you to keep it
together, at least until I get elected.

354
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,335
- Alright?
- Yes, sir.

355
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,904
What about drugs?

356
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,490
Any pictures of you taking drugs?

357
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,110
No. I've been clean for months.

358
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,193
Okay.

359
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,746
So what do you think Hunter was referring
to when he said he may have just

360
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,190
ruined his father's life?

361
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,970
<i>Good to have you in New York City,
evening everybody.</i>

362
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,570
<i>I'm Martha McCallum in New York,
and this is the story tonight:</i>

363
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,890
<i>A Fox News alert with some
brand new developments,</i>

364
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,090
<i>a senior federal law enforcement official
telling Fox News that the FBI does</i>

365
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,890
<i>have Hunter Biden's laptop.</i>

366
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,546
No, I saw CNN dismiss this.
They said it was Russian disinformation.

367
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,930
<i>And not part of a Russian
disinformation campaign.</i>

368
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,866
<i>We're also told that the contents may
not have been looked at right away as we</i>

369
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,723
<i>try to fill in the blank.</i>

370
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,250
Okay? What about our
Ukraine/China deals?

371
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,290
You don't keep those
documents on there do you?

372
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:05,524
Emails.

373
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,413
Emails. How many?

374
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,411
Everything the email app stores

375
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:13,740
everything you send, everything you
received, stored.

376
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:17,106
No don't you, don't you take them and,
and and, and put them in the, you know,

377
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,038
take them out and put them
in, in the, in the trash.

378
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:22,430
What do you mean delete?
Yeah, but they're still available.

379
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:23,706
Well, if you delete them,

380
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,090
how could they still be available?
I mean, that doesn't make a lick of sense.

381
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,610
Well, you can delete them on your end,

382
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,935
but other people may
keep them on their end.

383
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,130
Other people?
What other people?

384
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:42,050
Dad, I did a lot of deals with foreign
agents and governments.

385
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,307
Look, did you at least keep to
our agreement about the thing?

386
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:46,266
Yeah, your 10%.

387
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,696
- No, no, no, the thing.
- 50/50 splits, yes.

388
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:51,266
God dammit. No, I'm,

389
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,666
I'm talking about the foreigners.
I, know they know...

390
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,672
...they know my name.

391
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:01,702
Yeah, right?
No, no, so we never used your name

392
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:04,540
explicitly in any
correspondence relating to our

393
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:07,434
business deals.
Only face-to-face like we agreed.

394
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,650
Any emails I use words
like my guy or my chairman,

395
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,238
or the big guy.

396
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,274
Good.

397
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,610
I like that. The big guy.

398
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,410
Look, we sign NDA's so I could go to
prison for what I'm about to tell you,

399
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:33,190
I could even get canceled.
But I'm just a fictional character,

400
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,880
so screw it. What's happening in there...

401
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,643
Joe's in on it.

402
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,889
I've never discussed businesses
with my son and my brother,

403
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:47,033
as a matter of fact,
anyone else.

404
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,533
Period.

405
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:56,400
As Joe would say, that's a
baloney sandwich. Case in point:

406
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,543
Ukraine.

407
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,640
It's a country that shares its
eastern border with Russia,

408
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:09,040
and that Eastern territory is rich in
fossil fuels, so Russia wants it badly.

409
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,840
Our story starts in the early
2000's under the regime of corrupt

410
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,920
Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.

411
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,610
That's Mykola Zlochevsky,

412
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,903
a Ukrainian oligarch and longtime recipient
of Yanukovych's governmental favors.

413
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:39,505
Zlochevsky would have $23 million
of his assets frozen by the UK

414
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,310
for money laundering,
embezzlement, and bribery.

415
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,879
Do you like that?

416
00:39:45,404 --> 00:39:46,534
Crocodile.

417
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,530
They're killing my feet.

418
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,180
I've created an energy holding
company called Burisma Holdings.

419
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,660
I'll be the largest natural
gas producer in Ukraine.

420
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,260
I will expect some gratitude.

421
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,340
Don't worry, boss. You'll get your cut.

422
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,780
And how are you going to clean the money?

423
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,513
Through my bank.

424
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,900
That's Ivan Dollarevsky.

425
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,460
And Burisma will be an
offshore company, bossman.

426
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,940
Another corrupt oligarch, well known
for his peculiar business tactics.

427
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,196
A real corporate raider, that guy.

428
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,240
Dollarevsky was banned from
entering the United States.

429
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,193
<i>Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?</i>

430
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,420
The revolution is about
to begin any day now.

431
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,140
I'm getting the hell out of
here before they hang me.

432
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,420
Where will you go?

433
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,980
Where do you think, Moskva.
Russia is invading Eastern Ukraine.

434
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,700
Perfect. Burisma's main assets are there.

435
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,140
We'll be able to drill our asses off
on natural gas without any penalty.

436
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,565
No one will stop us.

437
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,084
Never waste a good crisis.

438
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,820
Don't forget my cut.

439
00:41:27,644 --> 00:41:29,499
Give my best to Vlad, please.

440
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,399
Good.

441
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,140
We need US support and cover,

442
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,920
who's the point-man for the
foreign policy in the Obama regime?

443
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,653
Joe Biden.

444
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,280
I know just the man we
need to join the board of Burisma.

445
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,296
I believe my assistance in
consulting with Burisma

446
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,560
over matters of transparency,

447
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,840
corporate governance, and
responsibility will benefit

448
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,000
both the economy

449
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,840
and the people of Ukraine!

450
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,120
Hunter had no experience with Ukraine.

451
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,040
He had no experience with the
energy sector or with their law.

452
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,640
So why do you think Burisma hired him?

453
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,520
Oh, good job guys. Good job.

454
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,273
So it looks...

455
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,500
like you need a billion dollars

456
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,940
to fix your energy program.

457
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,140
Look, here's the deal.

458
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,140
You behave yourself,

459
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,120
I think I can get my
family to help you out.

460
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,900
Now let's talk about our Ukraine
"quick pro crow." So here's the deal,

461
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,020
the media is helping us pin that on Trump,

462
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,140
but if there's anything on your computer
about our quick pro crow with Ukraine,

463
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,140
we're gonna have to run defense. Okay?

464
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,780
So walk me through what might
be on that damn laptop of yours

465
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,860
about our Ukraine thing.

466
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,140
Two laptops.

467
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,823
I'm sorry.

468
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,780
So is that illegal?

469
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:55,380
Using political office to benefit your
family is called influence peddling.

470
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,660
But if you do it through enough back
channels, they can't touch you directly.

471
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,700
You've gotta follow the money. But
first you have to follow the influence.

472
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,380
So I'll tell you what's going down:
Devon Archer is telling Joe Biden,

473
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,000
he just joined the board of the
Ukraine Energy Company, Burisma,

474
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,600
at the same time, VP Joe is the point
man for President Obama in the Ukraine.

475
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,120
So the obvious next question is,

476
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,320
Where's Hunter?

477
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,880
Okay, maybe it didn't happen exactly like
this, but metaphorically speaking,

478
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,640
Hunter never actually went
to Ukraine during all this.

479
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,120
But don't let that fool you,
three weeks later,

480
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,000
he was appointed to the board of Burisma.

481
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:01,800
Like my dad says,
we never discussed my businesses, period.

482
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,960
My word as a Biden.

483
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,160
And you can trust them, they never
discussed their business around the world.

484
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,400
Or my cut.

485
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:15,624
Hunt?

486
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:24,640
Hunt, how much money did
you get outta Burisma?

487
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,051
Yeah, we talked about this,
$83,000 a month, each.

488
00:45:28,076 --> 00:45:29,744
No, we didn't talk about this.

489
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:36,040
I'd remember 83,000.
You forget 80, 85 or even 90,000.

490
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,270
But 83,000?
That's, that's a weird number.

491
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,320
I wouldn't forget 83,000.
You understand me, son?

492
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,260
I understand you, dad,
when we did the deal,

493
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,140
Devon Archer and I got paid through
the shell company, 3.4 million total.

494
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,703
What about Devon?

495
00:45:55,728 --> 00:45:59,733
I mean, can we trust him?
He's uh, he's not family.

496
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,390
Well, you discussed it with him yourself
when he visited you at the White House.

497
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,790
Yeah, you sure as hell
better still have my split.

498
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,900
I do, come on man.
You'll get your money, I promise.

499
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:13,630
Hey, don't gimme the "Come
on" because if you don't have it,

500
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,550
I'm gonna take you outside and
beat the living hell outta you.

501
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,575
Okay, dad.

502
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,874
Good boy.

503
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,718
What about Hunter's
business partner?

504
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:31,503
- Devon Archer?
- Yeah.

505
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:32,763
Follow the money.

506
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,270
Why did your dad's administration
appointees arrest me?

507
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,054
Tryin' to put me into a jail?

508
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,830
I just don't get it, man.
Why would they try to ruin my family?

509
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:58,966
Hunter, they want to destroy my kids man.
And no one from your family side steps in.

510
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,910
Just, just, just try at least to help me.
I don't get it.

511
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:07,630
A bunch of these Asians,
they get in my head asking me the same.

512
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,230
I'm curious, what should I say?

513
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,670
Every great family in the
United States is persecuted

514
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,390
You... you are part of a great family.

515
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,080
Not a sideshow, not someone to be
abandoned in your darkest moments.

516
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,960
The Bidens are different.
You are a Biden.

517
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,760
It's the price we pay for power.

518
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,980
And the truth will prevail
if you have the guts,

519
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,800
the stamina, and enough love

520
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,600
to stay the course.
Understood?

521
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,000
- Understood. Yeah, thanks.
- Good.

522
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:19,000
Turns out Devon got convicted for
conspiracy to commit security fraud

523
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,320
against the Native American
tribe of the Ogallala Sioux nation.

524
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,780
But he claims he
is not a racist.

525
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,304
And where's Hunter?

526
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,570
I don't know anything
about that deal.

527
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,050
My word as a Biden.

528
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,100
What about your company's
work with Anna Catarina,

529
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,100
a Russian tied to organized crime?

530
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:50,860
Does not ring any bells.

531
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,416
Hello?

532
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,860
- How are you doing?
- Wait, wait.

533
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:19,519
Hello?

534
00:49:21,344 --> 00:49:22,844
It's done.

535
00:49:23,568 --> 00:49:24,868
Good.

536
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,463
Hello?

537
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,580
Hunter, darling.

538
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,473
Hey, baby.

539
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,169
I have the money I promised.

540
00:49:44,594 --> 00:49:45,596
I'll wire you

541
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,220
$3.5 million.

542
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,690
Oh, goody.

543
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,990
Look, here's the deal.
I can remember getting paid some money,

544
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,590
but I can't remember what for,
I can't remember what we did with it.

545
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,273
Consulting.

546
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,190
Yeah, consulting.

547
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,243
Consulting.

548
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,270
So, Devon got caught for securities fraud,

549
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,286
Zlochevsky got charged
for money laundering,

550
00:50:29,311 --> 00:50:33,356
and Dollarevsky got caught
 for embezzling 1.8 billion.

551
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,300
And Hunter worked with
all of them at Burisma.

552
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:42,176
Then the Ukrainian justice department
was going to investigate Burisma

553
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,360
until, guess who, intervened?

554
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,195
Don't worry, dad,
you have

555
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,264
plausible deniability for most
things except the video.

556
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,183
What video?

557
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,480
The one when you said you'd get rid of
the prosecutor who was investigating me.

558
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,860
Malarkey.
That's a baloney sandwich.

559
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,000
..I'm not going to her. We're not
gonna give you the billion dollars.

560
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,920
I looked at them and I said,
I'm leaving here in six hours,

561
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,760
if the prosecutor's not fired, you're
not getting the money.

562
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,833
Son of a bitch,
he got fired.

563
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,319
<i>That's the angle
that's the way</i>

564
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:25,810
<i>that's the way
how we play</i>

565
00:51:25,835 --> 00:51:27,768
<i>I don't care
on my shit</i>

566
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,546
<i>I be smoking up a J</i>

567
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:31,304
<i>I'm gonna blow a couple holes</i>

568
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,275
<i>then I'm cutting off my hoes</i>

569
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,824
<i>that's the angle
that's the way</i>

570
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,040
<i>That's how we play</i>

571
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:45,320
Quid pro quo with the Ukraine,
brilliant strategy,

572
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,244
then accuse Trump of
making a phone call

573
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:50,636
doing the exact same
thing they were doing.

574
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,180
Oh, and guess what happened to
that $1 billion loan to Ukraine?

575
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,023
General?

576
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,240
$1.8 billion, distribute how you see fit.

577
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:17,176
After you lifted the travel ban on
Dollarevsky, our Ambassador to the

578
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,840
Ukraine asked for me to be put
on a do not prosecute list.

579
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,827
Do you remember our
ambassador Yovanovitch?

580
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,384
No, I don't think so.

581
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,320
Oh yeah, but she had a different
smell, that one.

582
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,511
She helped us out a lot.

583
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,244
Hello?

584
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,603
Hello? Oh, I can't hear anyone.

585
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:41,521
Dad...

586
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:45,024
your phone is upside down.

587
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,200
Hello? Yes, I'm listening.

588
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,573
Oh,

589
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,413
You're kidding.

590
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,160
The FBI just subpoenaed the laptop.

591
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:01,983
Shit.

592
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:08,240
He is. That's great.
Was that Adam's idea?

593
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,080
Thanks Nancy. Yeah. Yeah.
I'll be over there as soon as possible.

594
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,720
The repair shop guy's a Trumpster,
they're making it all about him.

595
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:25,360
Great. They're gonna label it a
Russian disinformation campaign.

596
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,800
What again? That work?

597
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,640
Well, they're already getting signatures
from intelligence agencies,

598
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,400
with a little help from the media,
I think we can destroy this little guy.

599
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,645
We just sit back
and watch it happen.

600
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,084
Good.

601
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,560
I've just been looking for an
opportunity to focus on my art.

602
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,980
What the hell are you talking about?
Your art?

603
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,375
I'm an artist, dad.
I'm getting gallery representation.

604
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,880
- What? Nude pictures of yourself?
- No.

605
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,060
You never take my ambition seriously,
like you did with Beau.

606
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,856
Because Beau wanted
to change the world,

607
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:16,454
you want to finger paint.

608
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,490
It's not finger painting.

609
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,683
Yeah, I just,
I wish you were more like Beau.

610
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,434
I wish you were more like mom.

611
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:28,873
You're a Biden,

612
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,393
act like one.

613
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,260
Get the hell outta here.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

614
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,419
Do you sell these
paintings of yours?

615
00:54:45,444 --> 00:54:47,274
Yes, if someone wants to buy them.

616
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:49,479
Oh, we can find buyers.

617
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:52,964
They'll pay a lot if
it can be kept private.

618
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,980
For the love of God stay outta
sight and under no circumstances

619
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:05,140
admit or deny ownership
of that goddamn toplop.

620
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,123
Can you do that for me?

621
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:12,124
Yes, sir.

622
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,740
I gotta go take care of this.

623
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,373
I know.

624
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,510
Son?

625
00:55:26,035 --> 00:55:28,784
You're the smartest man I know.

626
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:34,703
Thanks, dad.

627
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,413
To the airport.

628
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,840
Stop at the Dairy Queen first.

629
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,720
His favorite flavor: chocolate chip.
CNN did an in-depth report on it.

630
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,192
The shit we have to tolerate.

631
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:21,276
Oh, and one more thing,
it's a little off topic, but,

632
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,560
Epstein didn't kill himself.

633
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,485
Tyrone, could you get me a
glass of warm milk please?

634
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,464
Yes, sir.

635
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,250
It was about the laptop, wasn't it?

636
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,730
So you do know who I am.

637
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,770
No, only when I saw your dad in the SUV.

638
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,340
How do you know about the laptop?

639
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:12,780
Well, I'm sitting here, don't you
think I'm gonna jump on the internet?

640
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:13,963
It's on the internet.

641
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,700
Don't worry. It's only on
right wing propaganda sites.

642
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,660
Nobody reads those. It's for conspiracy
theorists and Russian disinformation.

643
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,620
White supremacists.

644
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,860
Do you believe them?

645
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,860
Of course not. Nothing you or your father
could ever do could be as bad as that.

646
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,453
I'm here for you, Hunter.

647
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,413
You can call me Hunt.

648
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:54,563
Hunt.

649
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:22,900
That was amazing.

650
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,980
I've never had sex like that before.

651
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,060
Flattery will only get you more.

652
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,540
No, no, I mean it.

653
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,113
Oh,

654
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:44,360
Usually, I have to be high or do
something with kinky little videoing.

655
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,740
I can do kinky.

656
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,220
You're so different, Kitty.
You're not like the others.

657
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,860
What's your last name?

658
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,593
Cat.

659
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,020
No, really.

660
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,860
Mm. My real name is Grace Anderson.

661
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,223
Grace.

662
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,380
I never tell my clients that,
so, consider yourself special.

663
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,573
I love you, Grace Anderson.

664
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,680
Can I give you something special?

665
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,693
Mm.

666
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:50,663
It's not a ring,

667
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,314
but it is my heart.

668
00:59:57,539 --> 00:59:59,504
My Nantucket.

669
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,613
You look so innocent.

670
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,160
Family first.

671
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,280
Will you marry me?

672
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,393
Are you serious?

673
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,320
Yes, I don't lie.

674
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,520
You're an addict.

675
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,480
I'm addicted to love.

676
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,680
You're addicted to sex.

677
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,160
You can't have one without the other.

678
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,760
I can't marry you, Hunter...

679
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,569
but I do wanna help you.

680
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:58,784
I'm on your side.

681
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,560
How can you help me?

682
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,153
Well, my father,

683
01:01:09,178 --> 01:01:12,320
world's biggest
asshole though he is,

684
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,820
is nevertheless an attorney.

685
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,360
Yeah, I got enough lawyers.

686
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,560
That's not what I mean.

687
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,536
He taught me how to answer questions
and accusations in life

688
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,420
without incriminating yourself.

689
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,960
So, tell me what's on the
laptop that they might leak and

690
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:39,480
I can help you prepare for
interviews or legal depositions.

691
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:49,760
So, what you wanna marry
me but you don't trust me?

692
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,693
That's not fair.

693
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:56,560
It's totally fair.
I entrust myself to you.

694
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,873
Don't you trust me?

695
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:13,420
Okay, here's the deal:

696
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:21,240
I already discussed most
of this with my father

697
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:24,320
but I got interrupted before
I got to the difficult part.

698
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:30,120
Okay. I will help you take the difficult
part and turn it into the easiest part.

699
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,500
What do you know about China?

700
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,200
Well, actually more than you think I would.

701
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,360
Why, are you some blonde
Chinese spy or something?

702
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,613
Hunter.

703
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,693
I'm joking.

704
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,840
My family worked as missionaries
in China for 10 years,

705
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,760
I actually have a lot of
good friends still there.

706
01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:00,760
China is kind of a sticky
topic for me and my dad.

707
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:06,200
Okay, so let's pretend
I'm your attorney,

708
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,576
tell me what facts they
might leak about you,

709
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,040
and we'll come up with a narrative.

710
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,240
And then we feed the
narrative to the media

711
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:18,600
but the media are already on
my side except for fucking Fox.

712
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:23,080
Well, the masses believe
the story they hear the most.

713
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,993
Hmm.

714
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:27,596
Well the story that we have to change is
that I'm peddling my father's influence

715
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,160
for money for our family.

716
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,440
Someone told me that's illegal.

717
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,333
Not necessarily.

718
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:42,680
Trump and Fox think that he's
compromised with our Chinese enemies.

719
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:44,043
<i>Hello?</i>

720
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,526
Trump's a Russian asset...

721
01:03:46,551 --> 01:03:48,496
<i>- Hello?</i>
- ...a hypocrite.

722
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,353
Mr. Biden?

723
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:52,680
Who let you in?

724
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,240
Uh, we tried to call you sir.

725
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,120
I even knocked on the door
but you didn't do anything.

726
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:02,600
I'm very sorry, but
we have to ask you to leave today.

727
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:03,786
What?

728
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:04,960
We've been getting some complaints.

729
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:10,360
Oh, it's fine. I'll, I'll pay, you
know, make it good. What do you need?

730
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,120
Uh, I actually don't really need money.
By the way, your card was declined.

731
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,240
What I would love is just-

732
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,504
I got other cards,
try that one.

733
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:23,016
There's a fucking card.
Want another card?

734
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,560
There's a card, try that card.
No, wait, that one is good too. Or him.

735
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:29,656
Okay.

736
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,860
Good? Try that one.

737
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:31,983
Okay. Thank you.

738
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:36,712
Okay. Sorry.

739
01:04:36,737 --> 01:04:38,013
Don't forget your tip!

740
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,663
Have a nice day.

741
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,180
It wasn't his fault.

742
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,793
I got other places.

743
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,440
Come on Grace Anderson,

744
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,443
let's go.

745
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:05,356
Okay, lemme just take you back
to the beginning. In 2010,

746
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:10,320
my dad was vice president to Obama
and that's when we realized that China

747
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,760
was a financial sleeping dragon.

748
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,800
So when my dad flew over
to meet the president,

749
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,720
I went with him to meet
prominent business officials.

750
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:26,640
Between 2010 and 2013,
I met the most powerful men in China.

751
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:31,400
It was like meeting the heads of JP Morgan,

752
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:37,680
Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs...

753
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:49,336
except they were all communists.

754
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,496
In fact, none of the heads of those
American financial institutions would've

755
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,160
got in the room with these guys,
and I got no experience whatsoever.

756
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,560
So why would they wanna meet with you then?

757
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,920
- I do have a superpower.
- Mm.

758
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,840
Dad, daddy?

759
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:16,240
This is Mr. Jonathan Li,
vice president of Bohai Capital,

760
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,110
a private equity firm,
we're creating a new company with him.

761
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:26,240
Mr. Li? This is vice president,
my father, vice president Joe Biden,

762
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,840
vice president of the United States.
My father.

763
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,255
The company is Bohai
Harvest, RST.

764
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,780
The deal in 1 billion in investments,
10 days after meeting with the big guy.

765
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,101
Then Bohai Harvest became

766
01:06:52,126 --> 01:06:56,407
a nuclear power company that
was stealing US nuclear secrets.

767
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:01,500
Then we signed a deal with a
company tied to the Chinese Navy,

768
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,500
then we signed with a company that was
stealing US tech to build fighter jets,

769
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:09,396
then we teamed up with a company that
was trying to take control of the

770
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,380
world market of rare earth materials
with military applications.

771
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,740
Of course, I knew nothing
of their crimes.

772
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,340
But, all your business
deals are legal, right?

773
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:31,780
Yeah, technically, on paper.

774
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,420
So what's on the laptop
that's not on paper?

775
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,180
Gimme a minute.
I need some uh, some courage.

776
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,660
CEFC is China's largest
private oil company,

777
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:57,340
they've been snapping up
oil fields across the world,

778
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,220
now they're looking to
get into Central Europe.

779
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:02,940
Private oil company?
That means it's not communist, right?

780
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:06,700
Yeah, well, the chairman is, uh,
close with the Communist party.

781
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,580
Does that make you like communism-light?

782
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:09,803
Yeah, sure.

783
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:29,320
Welcome Mr. Biden,
son of Vice President Biden.

784
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:41,280
We look forward to working with you
and hope to hear much about your father

785
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,840
and his interests.

786
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:46,920
Will do, comrades.

787
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,960
After this trip I met with Ye again,

788
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:07,640
Mr. Biden,
son of Vice President Biden,

789
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,595
welcome.

790
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,244
Please?

791
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,733
Do you like birds?

792
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:23,800
My fetish, I love them.

793
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:25,600
They all have names.

794
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:30,690
You and I would be 50/50 partners
with the holding company.

795
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:34,130
It will make you $10 million a
year for you and your family.

796
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:38,570
I can help make that happen.
Hmm. But here's the deal.

797
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:43,370
Renumeration will need to be split six
ways. I'll hold 10% for the big guy.

798
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:47,105
Big guy?

799
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,914
You mean vice president?

800
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:52,090
No, come on man. The big guy.

801
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:54,970
Ah, big guy. Huh?

802
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,650
Here's to a lasting, long,
and lucrative relationship.

803
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,946
I'm having a difficult
time getting my daughter

804
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:25,203
 into a certain exclusive
Manhattan private school.

805
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:28,290
Well that, my dear chairman,
is a Biden family speciality.

806
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,030
I will take care of it.

807
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,416
I am a bit concerned about
US federal authorities

808
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,608
looking into one
of my associates.

809
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:40,894
His name is Patrick Ho.

810
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,150
He's a good man.

811
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,210
I'm a lawyer.
I'll represent him.

812
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:47,993
Wonderful.

813
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,530
Patrick Ho will wire you $5
million for consulting fees.

814
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,730
I trust that will be acceptable?

815
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,330
It's a little light, but acceptable.

816
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:06,330
You'll be so gracious,
I have a gift for you. It is our custom,

817
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,450
my way of saying, "thank you."

818
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,858
Wow, that's a biggie.

819
01:11:14,883 --> 01:11:16,344
How many carats?

820
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:17,480
3.16.

821
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,520
What's that, $40,000?

822
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,840
80,000.

823
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:24,123
Thank you.

824
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,480
I believe it'll look
wonderful on your wife.

825
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,656
Sadly, we're getting divorced,
so for the sake of the settlement,

826
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,600
let's just say it's $10,000.

827
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,840
Ah, please forgive me,
there is one more thing.

828
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,920
Let us call them your expense account.

829
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:44,240
The credit line has over a
hundred thousand dollars on it.

830
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:47,536
There is one card for you,

831
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,420
one card for your uncle partner,
and one for his wife.

832
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,800
You're a very gracious man yourself.

833
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:08,736
Technically, he sent the diamond to my
room and then gave me the cards in his

834
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,520
$10 million New York penthouse,
but you get the point.

835
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,080
I didn't know you were a criminal lawyer?

836
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,773
I'm not.

837
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:24,940
So, whatever happened to that Patrick Ho
guy you were supposed to lawyer for,

838
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:27,600
Ye's colleague?

839
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:29,823
Yeah, him.

840
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,640
He was the fucking spy chief of China.

841
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,600
I'm thirsty, do you want a coffee?

842
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,200
Sure.

843
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,160
While he's in custody,

844
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,355
mr fucking spy chief calls my
fucking uncle looking for me.

845
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,880
Well, weren't you his lawyer?

846
01:12:56,910 --> 01:13:01,320
What? No, I wasn't his lawyer.
I had no idea about his crimes either.

847
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,160
And where did Ye go?

848
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,840
He was detained by the government.
He vanished, never seen again, disappeared.

849
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,840
What about the other
companies you made deals with?

850
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,040
They were all tied to
the communist party?

851
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:17,920
Well, it's China, man.

852
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:21,040
Every company that makes money
is controlled by the party.

853
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:25,800
And what about the other companies you
mentioned had military applications,

854
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,533
you mean like weapons?

855
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,143
Yeah.

856
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,960
You mean like weapons that
could be used against America?

857
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,391
We're not at war
with China, man.

858
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,864
China's not our enemy.

859
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:45,417
Come on, man.
They're not bad folks, folks.

860
01:13:45,442 --> 01:13:48,240
<i>It's a positive development.
What are we worried about?</i>

861
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,744
And what about the nuclear
company you told me about?

862
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:57,336
China General Nuclear. Yeah,
one of their senior advisors, Allen Ho,

863
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,880
he did make some deals that
were outside of the box.

864
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,573
FBI!

865
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:20,760
But did they at least catch him
before he could get too many secrets?

866
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,000
Well, he'd been doing it for
almost 20 years.

867
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:26,593
Holy shit, Hunter.

868
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:31,720
Come on man, you're supposed to be helping
me with the narrative not grilling me.

869
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,353
I am.

870
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,000
I didn't know what he'd done.

871
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:46,120
But did your company divest from
CEFC when it all came out?

872
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:48,840
Well, I resigned from Bohai Harvest,

873
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:51,400
which is a company that links
all this stuff together.

874
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:52,560
Doesn't that say something?

875
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,080
Did you sell your shares?

876
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,680
Did Christopher Heinz?

877
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,200
Who's Christopher Heinz?

878
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:00,728
John Kerry's son,
the uh, ketchup guys.

879
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:06,696
Look, me, him, and Devon were
in business together.

880
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,880
Shit. That doesn't look good, does it?

881
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,440
Are there any other communist controlled
companies that you haven't mentioned?

882
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,485
Um,

883
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:22,016
Face++,

884
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,010
state-of-the-art
facial recognition technology, I mean

885
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:29,204
talk about tech advancement, man the US
would be stealing their shit off China.

886
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,625
What?

887
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:45,823
What is it?
What'd I say?

888
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:49,170
That's surveillance technology, Hunter.
That's something I know about.

889
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,730
Ah, so you are a Chinese spy.

890
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,650
I told you my parents were
missionaries to China.

891
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,890
There are tens of millions of closed
circuit cameras all throughout China.

892
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,890
They helped sponsor some
families to get asylum in the US.

893
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,450
Yeah, but it, I thought they
only used it to catch criminals.

894
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:16,250
That's not the only reason.
That's how they control their citizens.

895
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,930
And if you don't agree
with the communist party,

896
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,346
then you're defined as a criminal.

897
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:27,330
Face++ has been used to hunt down Muslims
and force them into concentration camps.

898
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,270
There's over 2
million political prisoners.

899
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,570
They separate the children from their
parents and brainwash them with communism.

900
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,050
They teach them to hate
their families and religion.

901
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:46,090
The CCP calls it: de-radicalization
of extremists and terrorism.

902
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:57,290
You shared your life with me,
now I'm gonna share my life with you.

903
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,503
This is Ming Yu.

904
01:17:05,228 --> 01:17:07,524
I call her my aunt.

905
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,280
She was like family
when we were out there.

906
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,040
Do you see her much?

907
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:14,453
No.

908
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:18,175
I'll show you why.

909
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,590
This is the concentration camps.

910
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:31,590
See these three children in the picture?

911
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,310
Those are Ming Yu's children
being indoctrinated,

912
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,270
being taught to love President Xi
and hate their mother.

913
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:45,310
There's also live organ harvesting
of religious and political prisoners.

914
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:50,830
And the women,
they get extra special treatment here,

915
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:55,350
like Ming Yu. She took these
secret pictures of the camp.

916
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,070
These are women waiting in line for
forced abortions and sterilizations.

917
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:06,610
I don't have any more pictures of Ming Yu.

918
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:12,930
After she took the photos,
she was raped and she disappeared.

919
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,290
We haven't heard from her in months,
she's probably dead.

920
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:23,050
This is genocide, Hunter.
Real genocide.

921
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,340
I wanna help you, I really do.

922
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:31,156
I don't believe you would continue to
work with people like that if you knew

923
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,420
what they did to women and children.

924
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,640
You didn't know, did you?

925
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,940
If you knew, and all of
this was on your laptop,

926
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:56,300
you hope the laptop will take down
everybody with you, including your father.

927
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,960
You don't love him,
you hate him.

928
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,873
You want revenge.

929
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,260
No, Grace, I would never do that.

930
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,100
You had everything, Hunter.
Everything.

931
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,220
And you threw it all away.

932
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,980
I lost my Nantucket!

933
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,740
I think I should go now.

934
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,580
Please don't go. I love you.

935
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:49,460
You don't love me, you love what
you can't have. You crave it.

936
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:53,380
When you do get it, you just...

937
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:57,180
Just wait, wait.
Wait a minute...

938
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:03,823
Dad.

939
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:10,920
Yeah, yeah.

940
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:18,556
No, no. Uh, I'm gonna focus on my art.
I'm gonna, I'm,

941
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:22,440
I'm gonna stay outta the way.
Yeah, no, I'm not gonna confirm,

942
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:27,000
deny any of the, of my laptop.

943
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,160
No, I'm not on drugs, dad.
 It's great.

944
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:34,920
It's like Beau is
watching down over us.

945
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,995
I love you, dad.

946
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,904
Dad?

947
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,263
What happened?

948
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:55,176
Trump is just being officially impeached

949
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:00,100
by the House of Representatives for abuse
of power and obstruction of Congress.

950
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,760
Obstruction of Congress,
what does that even mean?

951
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,600
Who cares?
All of the attention is off me.

952
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:10,240
It's gonna be wall-to-wall,
"orange man bad."

953
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:18,560
Go get the big black guy and
get on your dancing shoes.

954
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,733
He wants you.

955
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:33,883
Where are you going?

956
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:36,080
I'm done, Tyrone.

957
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:37,383
Wait a minute.

958
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:45,893
What's this?

959
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:50,320
Handy recorder.
I use this for protection in the club.

960
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,560
I record everything,
just in case.

961
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:14,203
Yes, sir.

962
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,055
Assemble the usual suspects.

963
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,144
Where's Kitty?

964
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:23,463
Gone.

965
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:30,693
Bring her back.

966
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,620
What about the other
companies you made deals with,

967
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,900
they were all tied to the Communist party?

968
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:03,387
Well, it's China and every
company that makes money,

969
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:05,653
is controlled by the party.

970
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:09,600
And what about the other companies you
mentioned had military applications,

971
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,373
you mean like weapons?

972
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,653
Yes.

973
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,173
Yes?

974
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:30,853
Dad?

975
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:34,920
Grace, are you okay?

976
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,093
No.

977
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:42,040
Tell me.
Let me know how I can help.

978
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:46,656
I know I haven't spoken
to you in a long time...

979
01:23:46,681 --> 01:23:49,193
what I'm gonna ask you will
sound strange.

980
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:51,590
Ask me anything, sweetheart.

981
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:58,030
What would you do as a prosecutor
if you had evidence that

982
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,510
hurt your own side of the case?

983
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,110
I would release it,
'cause it's a rule of discovery.

984
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:08,310
If I didn't and it was discovered later
that I suppressed the information,

985
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:13,550
my entire case would be overturned
and I would be disbarred.

986
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:19,510
And what if you knew it would never be
discovered if you didn't release it?

987
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,283
I would do it.

988
01:24:24,808 --> 01:24:26,354
Because if I didn't,

989
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:30,830
I couldn't live with myself. If I hid
the truth in order to protect my belief,

990
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:33,070
then I'd be living a lie.

991
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:38,990
Dad, I'll call you back soon.
Is that okay?

992
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:40,923
Of course, sweetheart.

993
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,203
Thanks, dad.

994
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,313
Hello.

995
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,070
Kitty, it's Lorenzo.
I have some good news.

996
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,710
You've been quite a hit with the clients,

997
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:04,663
they want to pay off all of your college
debt and put you on retainer for two years.

998
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,110
Uhhuh. And what would
they expect from me?

999
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:09,653
Cooperation.

1000
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:15,310
I see. Well, tell them, thank you
very much, but I politely decline.

1001
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,098
Hello?

1002
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:05,845
Hi, Bob. It's Kitty, remember me?

1003
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:09,656
Of course I remember you,
you're hard to forget.

1004
01:26:10,381 --> 01:26:11,324
Who is it, Bob?

1005
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:12,960
Um, hold on, honey. It's work.

1006
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:17,120
This isn't a good time to talk.

1007
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:20,400
I'll make it quick,
are you still writing for The Post?

1008
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:23,880
Freelancing, yeah,
but they like my work.

1009
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,516
Okay, well, you probably won't believe me,

1010
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:31,440
but I have a story for you that's so big
it will change your career.

1011
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,720
Really? Well, what is it?

1012
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,720
But we have to meet in
person as soon as possible.

1013
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:41,800
Okay, I'll text you
exactly where and when.

1014
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:43,200
Okay, bye.

1015
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:16,943
Grace.

1016
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:21,460
What do you know about Hunter
Biden's business deals?

1017
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:24,810
Hunter Biden, uh,

1018
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:27,433
was working for companies
in China and Ukraine while

1019
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:29,874
his father was vice
president in the White House.

1020
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:32,330
That should tell you a lot. What else?

1021
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,330
Well, there's nothing illegal about that.
Is this the story you told me you had?

1022
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,010
What do you know about his laptop?

1023
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,850
Grace, just tell me what you've got.

1024
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:49,575
Hunter's been using his
father's name to make deals

1025
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,514
with foreign government
connected businesses.

1026
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:55,730
Joe gets a percentage cut of the
deals and he influences foreign policy

1027
01:27:56,050 --> 01:27:58,410
decisions in favor of those
companies and governments.

1028
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:02,407
This could take down
the entire Biden campaign

1029
01:28:02,432 --> 01:28:05,160
and even lead back
to President Obama.

1030
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:09,640
I have Hunter Biden's
admission on tape.

1031
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:12,330
The laptop has it all, the FBI
doesn't wanna do anything about it.

1032
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:16,010
Grace, you should be ashamed of
yourself recording a vulnerable addict,

1033
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,660
and besides it could be illegal.

1034
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:22,910
Are you a Trump supporter?

1035
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,990
What? No. I despise the man.

1036
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,793
Look,

1037
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,810
even if what you're saying is
true, it's not news.

1038
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:43,290
We have the chance to take
down a fascist dictator.

1039
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:48,690
You think any news org is gonna want
to touch your Russian disinformation?

1040
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:55,090
Maybe the shitty New York
Post will publish the story,

1041
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:59,000
But you really think that
Twitter, Facebook, Google,

1042
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:02,480
are gonna not ban it outright
with their algorithms?

1043
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,745
I'm sorry, Grace.

1044
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:10,234
This one's not for me.

1045
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:58,616
Rudy Giuliani has released a recording
of Hunter Biden telling all

1046
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,889
and has forced the
hand of the FBI.

1047
01:30:00,914 --> 01:30:03,344
News organizations
that previously were

1048
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:08,280
suppressing or ignoring the story of
Hunter Biden's laptop are now uncovering

1049
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:12,880
some disturbing discoveries.
Not only private pornographic pictures,

1050
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:17,240
but emails that may incriminate
the Bidens as a crime family.

1051
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,800
And in other news:
bad news for the Bidens.

1052
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:27,136
Hunter Biden, son of former Vice
president Joe Biden was arrested today by

1053
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,360
the FBI on multiple charges.

1054
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:33,110
- FBI!
- FBI! Don't move!

1055
01:30:33,835 --> 01:30:35,635
Why me?!

1056
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:38,240
The numbers do not lie,

1057
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:42,680
president Donald Trump has
won reelection by a landslide.

1058
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,213
Yes.

1059
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:52,080
In the end I realized the truth
coming out was just a dream,

1060
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:55,680
just a fantasy of
truth and justice,

1061
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,480
in a real world of
lies and corruption.

1062
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:02,480
Will those in power ever be held
accountable for their crimes?

1063
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:06,680
Will the news media ever again
care about facts and truth?

1064
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,080
I guess that's what
fairy-tale endings are for,

1065
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,480
to show us what should have been,

1066
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:17,600
what could be, if only we
change and do something.

1067
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:24,643
Grace.

1068
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:33,923
Daddy?

1069
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:46,805
My love.

1070
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,973
I love you, dad.

1071
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:04,580
Or maybe, in the end, the truth
itself has become the fairy tale.

1072
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:41,456
...emails about his business dealings
described by many intelligence experts as

1073
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,976
having hallmarks of a foreign
disinformation campaign-

1074
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,776
...and has all the hallmarks of a Russian
disinformation campaign.

1075
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,560
...they're part of a Russian, uh,
disinformation, uh, effort

1076
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:52,936
...to show business dealings
of Joe Biden's son,

1077
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,720
Hunter Biden, are connected to a
Russian disinformation campaign-

1078
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:01,240
...was the target of a Russian influence
campaign aimed at discrediting Biden-

1079
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,640
...Giuliani is feeding Russian
misinformation to Donald Trump.

1080
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:10,976
...the New York Post published a story
filled with unsubstantiated claims,

1081
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,956
and fed by Rudy Giuliani,
about emails found on a laptop in Delaware

1082
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,360
that may or may not belong to Hunter Biden-

1083
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:19,640
...russian Disinformation effort-

1084
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:23,696
...they're being used by the Russians
and by people connected, uh,

1085
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:28,160
to the Russians in Ukraine to try to
traffic in some of these, uh, conspiracies-

1086
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:30,647
...with the contents of
what may be potentially

1087
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:33,433
a foreign intelligence
operation in this campaign-

1088
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:37,400
...and an active attack in the
form of Russian disinformation.

1089
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:41,880
...this looks like your classic
disinformation campaign-

1090
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,765
Who do you think is behind this?

1091
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:46,480
Well, the Russians would
be my number one guess-

1092
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:50,680
...off of the unverified contents of a
mysterious laptop that somehow

1093
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,816
Rudy Giuliani got his hands on,
that some officials worry

1094
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,720
is tied to a Russian intelligence op.

1095
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,556
...DNA tests released today
confirms presidential candidate

1096
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:19,280
Joe Biden's son is the biological
father of an Arkansas woman's child.

1097
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:32,360
I mean, I, you know, they're not bad
folks, folks. But guess what?

1098
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:36,216
They're not a co- they're, they're, they're
not competition for us.

1099
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:40,960
Uh, so I got Ukraine and, uh,
I went over, I guess the 12th,

1100
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,320
13th time to Kiev.
And, uh, and I was going,

1101
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,920
supposed to announce that there was
another billion dollar loan guarantee.

1102
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:53,320
And I had gotten a commitment
from Poroshenko and from, uh,

1103
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,796
Yatsenyuk that they would take
action against the state prosecutor,

1104
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:58,976
and they didn't.
So they said they had,

1105
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,956
they were walking out the press
conference, said no. I said,

1106
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:05,240
I'm not going or we're not gonna give
you the billion dollars. They said,

1107
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:08,096
you have no authority. You're not the
president. The president said, I said,

1108
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,760
call him. I said, I'm telling you,
you're not getting the billion dollars.

1109
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,800
I said, you're not getting the billion.
I'm gonna be leaving here

1110
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:17,096
in I think it was, what, six hours?
I looked at it, I said,

1111
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,800
we leave in six hours, if the prosecutor's
not fired, you're not getting the money.

1112
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:24,400
Well, son of a bitch, he got fired.
