00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,103
(soft music)

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,072
(glass shattering)

3
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,129
(soft music)

4
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,535
(water babbling)

5
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,259
(bus engine roaring)

6
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,170
(wind blowing)

7
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,214
- Hey you, Teddy? - Yeah, Leo?

8
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:58,284
- [Leo] Yeah, you wanna throw your stuff in the trunk?

9
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,900
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,336
So what are you writing?

11
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:18,705
- [Teddy] A novel.

12
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,841
I've been stuck at the last third for a long time.

13
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,445
I just need some time to really nail it, you know?

14
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,479
- [Leo] Yeah.

15
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,350
Well, I don't write, but I know what you mean.

16
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,255
- This is amazing. - Yeah.

17
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,458
You'll be out here in the middle of nowhere for a while.

18
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,592
- [Teddy] No kidding.

19
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,428
- [Leo] You'll get a lot of writing done.

20
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,197
- [Teddy] How long have you been acting?

21
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,569
- [Leo] Oh, I've been trying for about four years now.

22
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,539
- How's it going? - It's okay.

23
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,474
I mean mostly small stuff.

24
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,276
No commercials yet or anything.

25
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,677
- Yeah, that must be tough.

26
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,291
God, Leo, this is amazing.

27
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,525
- Wait 'til you see inside.

28
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,321
- Great.

29
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,723
- [Leo] How about a drink?

30
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,759
- [Teddy] What do you like to do here?

31
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,330
- [Leo] Crispin pays me a bit to keep the place in shape.

32
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,397
Lots of great hikes.

33
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,002
Sometimes I play music and I like to dance.

34
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,704
You know, in private.

35
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,672
- [Teddy] Cool.

36
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,942
- [Leo] I don't usually admit that.

37
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,612
(mellow music)

38
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,348
- Jesus.

39
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,583
- [Leo] Yeah.

40
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,022
- It just, you don't see this many stars

41
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:16,956
in the city.

42
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,960
Kind of puts things in perspective.

43
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,367
(chuckling)

44
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,635
- You must be exhausted.

45
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,971
- I am gonna pass out soon.

46
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,440
- Sorry we got so drunk.

47
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,510
Was kind of my influence.

48
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,446
- [Teddy] I like to drink too.

49
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,384
Good thing I'm not staying.

50
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,985
- You wouldn't get any work done.

51
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,326
- It's be nice if you stopped by though.

52
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,862
It could get lonely otherwise.

53
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:00,900
- Yeah, I'll see.

00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,487
I think I have a hangover though.

Hm, what time is it?

66
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,828
- It feels late.

67
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,465
- I need a shower.

68
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,735
- Shower doesn't work.

- Don't leave right away.

92
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,704
- What about your writing?

93
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,675
- Well, I'm concerned

94
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,977
I might not know everything about this house.

95
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,647
- There's not much else.

96
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,582
- What about the car?

97
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,786
- Car works fine.

98
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,792
- I guess I'm just afraid to get to my writing.

99
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,730
- Yeah, I'm sensing that.

100
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,948
- Thanks.

101
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,016
- Call me anytime.

102
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,686
- I had a lot of fun last night.

103
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,289
- Get some writing done, Teddy.

104
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,191
- Okay.

105
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,632

(sighing)

108
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,164
The biggest obstacle I have is translating what I actually

109
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,466
feel into words.

110
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,202
I think I know what I'm saying until I read it later,

111
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,937
then it usually sucks.

112
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,340
- [Man] Just takes practice and diligence.

113
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,776
You don't get better until you've done it a lot.

114
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,747
- [Teddy] I wish I had someplace

115
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,816
quiet and away from the city

116
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,451
where I could write this damn thing.

117
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,921
- [Leo] I think I could help you.

118
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,460
(door slamming)

119
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,220

(whining)

121
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,354
- [Teddy] Hello?

122
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:47,193
- Hey, Leo, Teddy, just checking in on you.

123
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,627
You got in okay?

124
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,996
- [Teddy] Yeah, how's the writing going?

125
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,198
- Great.

126
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,866
Yeah, I've written some pages.

127
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,367
Not as many as I'd like, but.

128
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,536
- [Teddy] Well, it's only your first day.

129
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,470
- Yeah.

130
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,075
So you're going on any auditions or anything?

131
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,011
- [Teddy] No, I gotta work this weekend.

132
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,182
- When's your next day off?

133
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,219
- [Teddy] (laughing) Are you lonely already?

134
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,354
- Well, I mean, it's nice

135
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,656
to have some human contact, you know.

136
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:18,958
- [Teddy] You inviting me back out there?

137
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,626
- Yeah, of course.

138
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,627
I mean, by the end of this weekend,

139
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,030
I'll have written 20 pages, that's amazing for me.

140
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,635
This place is really inspiring.

141
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,570
- [Teddy] Well, I'll plan on coming up on Monday,

142
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,973
I'm not supposed to work again until Thursday.

143
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,975
- Great.

144
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,443
I mean, that should be cool.

145
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,913
I guess I can handle being alone until then.

146
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,250
- [Teddy] Well, call me if you need anything.

147
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,587
- Okay, man, bye.

148
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,923
- [Teddy] See ya.

149
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,970
(phone beeping)

150
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,343
(phone ringing)

151
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,279
- Hello?

152
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,681
- Crispin, it's Teddy.

153
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,717
- Hello Teddy, how are you coming up?

154
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:22,688
- God, I just have to tell you your house is amazing.

155
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,957
Thanks so much for letting me stay here.

156
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,027
- [Crispin] I'm glad you're using it, how's the weather?

157
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,029
- Just what you think, hot and sunny.

158
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,498
- Leo drive you?

159
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,302
- He is very nice.

160
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,604
You've known him awhile?

161
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,173
- You know, I knew his parents.

162
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,975
- Oh.

163
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,977
I thought you could have been lovers once.

164
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,747
- [Crispin] Oh no, he's like a little nephew to me.

165
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,616
I could never do that.

166
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,583
- Is he gay?

167
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,453
- [Crispin] He's had girlfriends in the past.

168
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,388
I think he's probably bi.

169
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,023
Who isn't these days?

170
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,427
You have to.

171
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,133
- Yeah, but I shouldn't be telling you that.

172
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,604
- [Crispin] Well, good luck figuring out the puzzle.

173
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,343
- You know your shower doesn't work.

174
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,345
- [Crispin] Changing the subject.

175
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,213
It hasn't worked since the earthquake.

176
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,548
I never bothered to fix it.

177
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,249
I usually take baths when I go out there.

178
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,184
- Where?

179
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,753
- [Crispin] I do it with hot water from the hose.

180
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,089
You stretch the hose out in the sun.

181
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,224
The water's a decent temperature to bathe in.

182
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,158
- Okay.

183
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,395
- [Crispin] But there are thousands of hot springs

184
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,297
you can go to, those are always nice.

185
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,166
- Yeah.

186
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,736
- And the writing?

187
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,039
- Great.

188
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,040
Couldn't be a better place

189
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,775
for me to finish this damn thing.

190
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,511
Thanks again so much.

191
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,646
- Well, keep in touch, my dear.

192
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,382
Anything you need, call Leo.

193
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,417
He knows the house very well.

194
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,351
- Okay.

195
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,287
Talk to you soon, Crispin.

196
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,123
- [Crispin] Bye, now.

197
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,610
(crickets chirping)

198
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,616
- Shit.

199
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,757
(bright music)

200
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,638
(energetic music)

201
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,451

00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:44,676

208
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:07,833
- I really missed you.

209
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,068
- [Leo] You been to town at all?

210
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,971
- Nah, just been writing.

211
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,406
- [Leo] You got bags under your eyes.

212
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,808
- (laughing) Yeah.

213
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,311
I'm on a night schedule now.

214
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,779
- You want a beer? - Sure.

215
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,558
So how was work this week?

216
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,993
- [Leo] Made a lot of tips.

217
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,496
- Ever thought of doing a play?

218
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,998
- Yeah, I've done a few.

219
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:41,867
Why?

220
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,801
- Just asking,

221
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,405
thought it might be better than waiting for that commercial.

222
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,472
- Well, yeah, usually.

223
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,008
There's no money in it though.

224
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,944
- Ever thought of doing something

225
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,880
where money wasn't the main objective?

226
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,484
- Yeah, all the time.

227
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,421
I'm just getting tired of it.

228
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,026
So what's your book about?

229
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:15,367
- Basically about a crazy family from the Midwest,

230
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,504
a family who crumbles when their son comes out as gay.

231
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,908
- Autobiographical?

232
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,911
- Yeah, a bit.

233
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,517
So do you have a girlfriend?

234
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:36,955
- I'm in between?

235
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,659
- What was your last girlfriend like?

236
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:43,929
- Nothing serious.

237
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,666
- Did you like to dance with her?

238
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,468
- No, she was into rock shows.

239
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,403
- And you don't really dance at a rock show?

240
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,139
- No, you sway.

241
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,010
- (laughing) I like the way you do that.

242
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,013
(both laughing)

243
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,449
(soft music)

244
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,488
How about something stronger?

245
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,424
- Sure.

246
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,577
- So have you only been with women?

247
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,846
- Who wants to know?

248
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,754
I've had my share of diverse experiences.

249
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,593
- You're hard to read.

250
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,832
- I used to think that everyone was bisexual,

251
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,935
but women don't like to hear guys talk like that.

252
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,007
- Yeah, I guess not.

253
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,775
- So I don't talk about it much.

254
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,149
- When you met me, did you think I was gay?

255
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,620
- I don't know.

256
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,624
A little maybe.

257
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,227
- I'm totally gay. (both laughing)

258
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,161
- Totally gay.

259
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,169
- So tell me about your diverse experiences.

260
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,980
- When I was 12, I used to fool around

261
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,115
with this neighborhood kid.

262
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,250
- [Teddy] Really?

263
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,551
What did you do?

264
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,525
- Well, we were talking one day about what do we feel like

265
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,995
if a, if a girl sucked your cock, you know, just,

266
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:00,599
just wondering about it and, and then he said,

267
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,535
"Hey Leo, oh no, no, no.

268
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,136
"Nevermind, nevermind."

269
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,939
So of course I didn't know what he was gonna say.

270
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,942
I had to pull it out of him and,

271
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:16,014
and he said that if I wanted that he would suck my cock.

272
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,688
- Where were you, what time of day was it?

273
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:29,561
It was nighttime and we were right near my garage.

274
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:34,633
So we went into my garage and he sucked my cock.

275
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,970
(both laughing)

276
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,039
- Did you like it? - Yeah!

277
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,710
That was my first time, so I never forgot it,

278
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:51,249
but then he wanted me to suck his, and I did,

279
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,919
but I didn't like it.

280
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,623
It was kind of smelly. (Teddy laughing)

281
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,327
- What happened?

282
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,662
Did you guys keep fooling around?

283
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,599
- Here and there, yeah.

284
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,137
- [Teddy] Did you ever go further than blowjobs?

285
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:13,872
- No.

286
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,776
Just touching and blowjobs.

287
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:21,913
That's sweet.

288
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,749
- It was what it was.

289
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,621
- [Teddy] Whatever happened?

290
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:30,889
Did you guys keep in touch?

291
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,360
- Well, he became a total pothead

292
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,395
and then I moved away and I heard

293
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,798
that he got into heavier drugs after that.

294
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,635
- Trying to deal with being gay.

295
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:46,771
- You think?

296
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,908
- Yeah.

297
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,113
- So what about you?

298
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,649
When did you know you were gay?

299
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,121
- I think I was five.

300
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,391
I was at a gas station with my mom

301
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,193
and the gas station attendant.

302
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,864
He was so beautiful.

303
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,667
He had slick black hair

304
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,336
and his pants were dirty with oil stains.

305
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,138
He was smacking gum.

306
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,775
And I told my mom that I wanted to take home the gas station

307
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,679
man to be my dad. (Leo laughing)

308
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,082
- You wanted to take the gas man home?

309
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,985
- He was probably 20.

310
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,154
- What did your mom say?

311
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,992
- She shushed me and told me not to say things like that.

312
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,763
- Keep it secret.

313
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,065
- Yeah.

314
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,867
For years, unfortunately.

315
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:55,140
And when I was 19 and tried to come out,

316
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,910
she told me that I wasn't gay.

317
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,713
I've never been with a girl and how can I know for sure?

318
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,983
Fucking a nightmare.

319
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,256
- So what'd you do?

320
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,164
- Went to college and became asexual.

321
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,408
Want another?

322
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,350
- Yeah.

323
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,028
That really sucks, man.

324
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,764
- What's that?

325
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:57,435
- You know, having to repress yourself like that.

326
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,306
- Yeah.

327
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,142
But eventually it reached a breaking point and that's where

328
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,978
my novel happens, then the aftermath.

329
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,381
- So what happened?

330
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,983
- I don't want to give it away.

331
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,787
- Okay.

332
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:31,803
- This is a truth serum. (laughing)

333
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,008
- Yeah. (both chuckling)

334
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,513
- So are we just gonna stay here all night and get drunk?

335
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,819
- We should do something else, right?

336
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,953
- Yeah.

337
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,498

Get out.

355
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,129
Please don't be mad at me.

356
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,431

It's my fault.

358
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,370
I shouldn't have. - Don't you see?

You liked it and now you're running away.

361
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,277
I'm not gay.

362
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,247

363
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,582
- Teddy, I'm sorry.

364
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,751

00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,121
Keep going.

551
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,326
- What's that?

552
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,596
- Jesus.

553
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,134
(panting)

554
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,761
(sobbing)

555
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,042
- Leo, what's wrong?

556
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,980
What are you crying about?

557
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:24,921
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

558
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:25,955
- You should eat.

559
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:30,193
- Yeah.

560
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:33,730
Yeah.

561
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:46,876
- When do you work next?

562
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,215
- I don't. - You quit?

563
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:56,753
- You could say that.

564
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,356
- You okay with money?

565
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,096
- You ask a lot of questions.

566
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,234
- Well, you're not very talkative.

567
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,772
- I'm going through some shit, sorry.

568
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:16,706
- That's apparent.

569
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,446
- I'm trying to spare you the gory details.

570
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,449
- You can talk to me, Leo.

571
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,117
Otherwise what's the point?

572
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,736
You want to be buried or cremated?

573
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,742
- I want to be buried at sea.

574
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,948
You? - Cremated.

575
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,049
Just seems easier.

576
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,122
- You think about death a lot.

577
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,023
- Sort of.

578
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:15,031
Just think about how long I'll have to write and whether

579
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,100
what I write'll mean anything to anyone.

580
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,905
- I'm pretty sure life is meaningless.

581
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:23,840
- Why?

582
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,848
- I just don't understand how it's so unfair to some people

583
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,851
like my wife.

584
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:39,188
Why would someone want to kill her?

585
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:42,859
- Yeah.

586
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,462
Fucked up things happening in the world.

587
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,934
But I think everything happens for a reason.

588
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,505
- You think that she was killed for a reason?

589
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,142
- I don't think that she deserved to die,

590
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:03,246
but it was just her time.

591
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:10,820
- Her time.

592
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:12,889
- Yeah.

593
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:13,956
I mean, we all have to die.

594
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,893
Sometimes it's by accident, car crash or something.

595
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,498
- Struck by lightning.

596
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,399
- Yeah.

597
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,573
- Do you think that there's always a reason?

598
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,443
- I think that we need to be good to each other

599
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:35,845
while we're on the planet.

600
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:40,583
After that there's a whole other set of circumstances

601
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:41,884
we have to deal with.

602
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:44,153
- Think so?

603
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:50,159
- I don't believe in God, but I believe in life energy,

604
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:53,996
like natural resource.

605
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:55,998
- Like water?

606
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,867
- Exactly.

607
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,944
- Are you taking the bus back to Ohio?

608
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,013
- Yeah, when it's time.

609
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:21,190
- You should get back to your writing, Teddy.

610
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,295
- Would you slice some watermelon?

611
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,196
It's in the fridge.

612
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,500
- Sure.

613
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,905
- Then I'll get back to work.

614
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,044
(tense music)

615
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,369
(eerie humming)

616
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,573
- Don't leave me.

617
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:23,279
(eerie music) (water trickling)

618
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:42,064
(crickets chirping)

619
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,045
- What scared you as a kid?

620
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,617
- Getting up in the middle of the night,

621
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,254
because I always thought that something like a big,

622
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:09,125
giant hand with sharp nails was gonna grab my ankle

623
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,794
and not let go. (laughing)

624
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,195
- Yeah, me too.

625
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,566
- Did that ever happen to you?

626
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,736
- No, did it happen to you?

627
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,072
- Oh yeah.

628
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:27,343
All the time, still does.

629
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,845
(fierce gobbling)

630
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,248
- Shit, you're scaring me.

631
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,220
Active imagination, huh?

632
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:40,389
- Yeah.

633
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,428
- You should do some writing.

634
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,367
- Maybe I will.

635
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,104
- Trust me, Leo.

636
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:57,239
We'll work on it.

637
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,583

- Nothing.

(crickets chirping)

656
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:44,273
- Leo.

657
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:50,546
I was thinking maybe tomorrow you should head back home.

658
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:53,882
- Really?

659
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,921
- It's just, I need some time alone to do some writing.

660
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,291
I like having you here, but you're distracting me.

661
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:04,593
- Yeah.

662
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:11,033
- You seem moody lately.

663
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,835
Maybe you need some time alone too.

664
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:16,639
- Yeah.

665
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,642
- Or maybe you need to look for another job

666
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:20,843
or acting, you know?

667
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:23,846
- Yeah.

668
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:28,784
- I'm sorry.

669
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,621
- No, that's okay, I'll go.

670
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,059
- Come back though.

671
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:38,360
In a few days.

672
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,365
- Okay, sure.

673
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,368
- You're not angry?

674
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:48,937
- No, of course not.

675
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:54,376

(birds singing)

677
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,588
- How'd you sleep last night?

678
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:42,458
You were acting strange.

679
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:46,662
- Okay.

680
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,870
(phone ringing)

681
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,143
- Hello? - How are you, Cheryl?

682
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,544
- [Cheryl] Hi.

683
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:04,480
Hold on.

684
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,416
Leo, it's Crispin.

685
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,453
- Hello?

686
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:15,557
- [Crispin] Leo, I have a favor to ask.

687
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:18,494
I have a friend, a former student of mine who I'm letting

688
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,095
stay at my house in the desert.

689
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,467
- What's his name?

690
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,570
- [Crispin] It'd Teddy, Teddy Rapaport.

691
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,509
- Do I know him?

692
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,944
- [Crispin] I don't think you've met.

693
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:38,180
He's arriving in a few days and since you have keys

694
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,182
I was hoping you could pick him up

695
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,984
and bring him to the house.

696
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:45,154
Open it up, show him the premises.

697
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,758
- What would you do if I couldn't pick them up?

698
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,929
- [Crispin] I have some other friends who stay there.

699
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,799
They might help, I just thought since you stay there

700
01:13:56,899 --> 01:14:01,203
so often you know the place better than me.

701
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:04,473
- Okay, yeah, yeah, I can pick him up.

702
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,609
- [Crispin] You're a doll.

703
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,878
He arrives on the 4:00 PM bus Tuesday.

704
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,482
- Okay, I'll be there.

705
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,022
- Where are you going?

706
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:20,923
- Crispin's.

707
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,560
- [Cheryl] So you'll stay there overnight.

708
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,495
- Yeah.

709
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,899
- You're always going out of town.

710
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:41,009
Do you want to do something with me?

711
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:42,511
- You want to go to the zoo?

712
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,647
- That's sweet.

713
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,584
- Yeah.

714
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:49,518
It should be fun.

715
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:52,654
- We haven't been in a while.

716
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:54,690
- Yeah.

01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,103
- Nothing.

721
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,314
- What are you thinking?

722
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,149
(eerie crackling)

723
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,684
- [Leo] About the elephants.

724
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,221
- [Cheryl] You and those elephants.

725
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:28,557
- [Leo] You don't like them?

726
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:33,328
- [Cheryl] I like all the animals, just not snakes.

727

- More recently it's been argued that schizophrenia

736
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,390
is just one end of the spectrum

737
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,125
of human experience and behavior.

738
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:11,093
Not a mental illness

739
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,061
and everybody in society may have some

740
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:15,197
such experience in their life.

741
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,933
This is known as the continuum model of psychosis

742
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:21,670
or the dimensional approach and is most notably argued by

743
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:25,974
psychologist Simon Rodel and psychiatrist Peter van Kerr.

744
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:43,425
Hey, gorgeous.

745
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,229
(waves crashing)

746
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,836
- [Leo] You want to do something with me?

747
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,707
- Come here.

748
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:01,977
- [Leo] I love you.

749
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,253
- I love you too, my darling.

750
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:13,989
- [Leo] Sun's out.

751
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,194
- You work on that tan, my love.

752
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,000

(dramatic music)

754
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,060
- I missed you so much.

755
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:56,765
- I missed you too.

756
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,837
- So what do you think of our situation?

757
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,776
- What do you mean?

758
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,080
- You know, us?

759
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,086
- I don't know.

760
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,457
- I'm falling in, Leo.

761
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,794
- Don't fall, Teddy.

762
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:27,863
- I'm serious.

763
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:30,966
- I'm not...

764
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:36,071
You shouldn't be in love with me.

765
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,207
- You don't want me to?

766
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,512
- I'm just not thinking about that.

767
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,016
- I wish you'd live in the present.

768
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,489
- You don't know me, Teddy.

769
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,859
I don't think I can know you.

770
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,263
How can I love you if I don't even know you?

771
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:03,565
- I don't know.

772
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,902
I want to know you better.

773
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:08,603
I want to love you, Leo.

774
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,106
I want to spend all of my time with you

775
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:13,041
for more than a few weeks.

776
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,511
- Is that love?

777
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:22,117
Maybe you're just lonely and I'm filling the void.

778
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,389
- Yeah, maybe.

779
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:32,861
Maybe that's all love is, filling the void.

780
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,030
You're probably right.

781
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,434
- That's what I think.

782
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,538
- Well, now you know how I feel.

783
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:56,318
(soft sobbing)

784
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:05,093
- Teddy, I'm not...

785
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:08,630
I'm sorry.

786
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,969
(Teddy softly sobbing)

787
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,570
It's not you, it's me.

788
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:25,614
It's me.

789
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,351
(water babbling)

790
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:51,473
- You're not gay, Leo.

791
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:57,579
- You haven't been with a woman.

792
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:02,484
How can you tell if you're a, a homosexual?

793
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:09,958
You have to find yourself.

794
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,095
You're still searching, aren't you?

795
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,536
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

796
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:30,378
I love you, son.

797
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:40,689

800
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,134
- I'm done.

801
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:35,236
- You finished the book?

802
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:38,406
Sit down.

803
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,449
- Will you read it?

804
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:49,517
- Yeah, of course.

805
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:51,686
That would be an honor.

806
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:54,389
- Will you really read it, Leo?

807
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,158
- Yeah, I will.

- Don't leave me.

811
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:46,367
- I'm sorry.
