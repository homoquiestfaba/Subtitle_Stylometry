Thank you for coming, Jake.

7
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:51,317
It's been...

8
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,387
[inhales]
It's been a long two weeks.

9
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:58,527
I came here to tell you that Hayes is
willing to forget your resignation.

10
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:01,195
The CIA is your home.

11
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:04,799
Defending America is your life.

12
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,201
Jake.

13
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,437
I need you to tell me the truth.

14
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,939
Did you kill Gino Orsetti?

15
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,941
[Jake]
You're asking me questions

16
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:17,676
[echoing]
that you will never understand.

17
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:21,213
And they're asking you
to make me come back.

18
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:23,284
I've been doing this
a lot longer than you.

19
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:28,254
And I've done a lot of things that
they will never let you know about.

20
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,224
The thing
that offends me the most,

21
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:35,694
it's not that I've risked
my life for my country

22
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:38,466
and done things that most
people couldn't have done.

23
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,435
- This country that I love so much...
- [Jake echoing] <i>Country...</i>

24
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:47,940
is the real reason
why I feel so betrayed.

25
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:50,878
That I was lied to
about what they've done...

26
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:55,683
to us,
to my [echoing] country.

27
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,917
- Slaughtered.
- [Jake echoing] <i>Slaughtered.</i>

28
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,352
That's the stuff
they're not telling you.

29
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:05,390
Where we have literally two governments
inside a [echoes] government.

30
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:08,829
Nobody would've thought,
20 years ago if I would've told them,

31
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:10,796
what's gonna happen now.

32
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:12,563
Did you kill Orsetti?

33
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,535
Don't ask me what I did...

34
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:17,805
how I did it,

35
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,474
or any of this bullshit
about "It's my home."

36
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:26,479
When you know
what [echoing] I know...

37
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,214
you wouldn't call it
your home either.

38
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,318
I'm done.

39
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:04,316

00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,585
Put it down!

178
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,417
- [in Italian] What do you want?
- Calm down.

179
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,618
Drop the gun, motherfucker!
Drop it now!

180
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,220
[in Italian] Fuck you!

181
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,054
Put it down!
I just want to talk.

182
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,356
[in Italian] Fuck you!

183
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,724
[Jake] We don't want you.
We want Orsetti.

184
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,361
Drop the gun, motherfucker!

185
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,228
[Jake] <i>I'll make you a deal.</i>

186
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,496
[in Italian]
You want to make a deal?

187
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,497
<i>We can make a deal.</i>

188
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,765
[in Italian] Who are you?

189
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,633
<i>Let's make a deal!
Put the gun down!</i>

190
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,235
- You want me to sell out my boss?
- Put it down!

191
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,538
- Let's make a deal?
- Put the fucking gun down!

192
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,675
[screams]

193
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,311
No, Zach! Zach!

194
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,680
Zach!

195
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,048
<i>Zach!</i>

196
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,519
Zach. Zach! Zach!

197
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,086
Zach!

198
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,693
Zach!

199
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,198
[whimpering] Zach.

200
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,738
[cries softly]

201
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:43,088
[woman] Were you or were you not in
a relationship with Agent Stevens?

202
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,288
Even though Alexander
trained you,

203
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,857
I'm the one that authorized
your release.

204
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,158
I am going to make your life
a living hell

205
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,065
unless you tell me everything I need
to know about Orsetti's organization.

206
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:58,468
Answer me, Dekker!

207
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,836
You know what?

208
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,404
You're really wasting my time.

209
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:05,708
You don't seem to understand
the chain of command here.

210
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,212
You're an asset. That's it.

211
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:13,181
I will throw your ass back in jail so
fast you won't even know what hit you.

212
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:16,220
You are in a CIA office.

213
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:21,492
[echoing, indistinct]

214
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:26,320
[sighs]

215
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:27,290
[in Italian] Don Gino.

216
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:28,823
[in Italian]
Santi, what do you want?

217
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:29,893
You got to see this.

218
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:34,462
What is so important that it can't
wait till I finish my breakfast?

219
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:36,165
We got a problem in Cambodia.

220
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,642
Kid, why you got this dead face?

221
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:48,308
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

222
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,543
You got your head
just to separate your ears?

223
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:51,714
Did you call Vinnie?

224
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:53,616
He doesn't answer.

225
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:57,453
[sighs]

226
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:00,857
Everything is okay.

227
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,824
Call our man
at the Phnom Penh police station

228
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:06,396
and see what happened.

229
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,163
You got it?

230
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:09,866
Okay.

231
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,468
[sighs]

232
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:19,809
Bruno.

233
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,611
He didn't find a fuck.

234
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:25,881
Look on the Internet.
We don't have time to waste.

235
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:30,285
They are not like us.
They are not to be trusted.

236
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:33,889
See what you find.

237
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:35,855
[in Italian] Okay.

238
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:37,258
[Gino] I'll wait for you.

239
00:21:47,936 --> 00:21:49,336
[man] How was your flight?

240
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:51,773
Good.

241
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:57,311
Have you found out anything?

242
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,380
Nothing at all.

243
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:02,783
Nobody knows who did this.

244
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:04,485
They are professionals.

245
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:09,591
Mr. Orsetti is very worried
about the situation.

246
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:17,365
He's expecting a response
from you soon.

247
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:19,901
I know.

248
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:24,405
I have arranged for you
to meet the girl.

249
00:22:24,872 --> 00:22:26,474
Has she said anything?

250
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:28,642
Nothing.

251
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:31,443
She is terrified.

252
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:33,512
We are supposed
to transfer her in the morning

253
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:34,949
to a federal prison.

254
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,890
I need just a couple of minutes
alone with her.

255
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,062
Who are you?

256
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:29,703
I work for Orsetti.

257
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:33,040
What did you tell them?

258
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:35,540
Nothing.

259
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:36,509
Anything.

260
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:39,311
What's gonna happen now?

261
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:40,711
Don't worry.

262
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:42,482
Everything will be okay.

263
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:45,985
I'm gonna show you something.

264
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:55,762
[cell phone beeping]

265
00:23:58,998 --> 00:24:00,099
[whimpering] No.

266
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:03,635
[sobbing] [in Spanish] My mother, no.
My mother, no.

267
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,009
Not my mama.

268
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,416
[sobbing continues]

269
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,085
Do the right thing...

270
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,787
and your mother will be okay.

271
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:38,704
[sighs]

272
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:46,578
[cell phone ringing]

273
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:54,419
[cell phone beeps]

274
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:57,388
[in Italian] It's me.

275
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:58,924
It's done.

276
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:12,503
[in Italian] Do we know who the son
of a bitch is that caused this mess?

277
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:15,139
This piece of shit.

278
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,542
I want to know who it is.

279
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,776
<i>Nobody knows.</i>

280
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:22,147
<i>Mao Mao says
it's a professional job.</i>

281
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:26,017
<i>And now the secretary
has someone high up.</i>

282
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,718
- I'm coming.
- <i>Quickly, please.</i>

283
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,489
I told you that I'm coming.

284
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:33,791
I'll take care of it.

285
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:39,061
Tell Mao to hold that answer
until I arrive.

286
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:40,865
- You got it?
- <i>I got it.</i>

287
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:43,168
Take care.

288
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:45,000
[cell phone beeps]

289
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,871
[sighs]

290
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:01,018
[woman]
The first thing I want to say...

291
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:03,486
is that I'm genuinely sorry...

292
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:06,057
for the loss of Agent Stevens.

293
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:08,591
I know
that he was your partner.

294
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:12,163
I know that he was your friend.

295
00:26:14,564 --> 00:26:16,166
And I know that he was
a trusted colleague.

296
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:20,570
But I am here to tell you...

297
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:23,039
that you're being reassigned.

298
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:29,246
The agency is restructuring
the Southeast operation.

299
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:32,183
It's going to be much more
corporate from now on.

300
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:35,185
There's no more room
for cowboys.

301
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,188
The agency is changing.

302
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,757
And the orders from higher up...

303
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:45,626
are that you all are no longer what
they're looking for in Southeast Asia.

304
00:26:45,628 --> 00:26:46,763
This is bullshit.

305
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,097
What about Orsetti?

306
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,999
[woman agent] Orsetti is
no longer your business.

307
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:52,936
You had your chance
with Orsetti.

308
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:57,573
You guys lost your chance
when you lost Agent Stevens.

309
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:01,144
That scumbag
killed one of our own.

310
00:27:03,346 --> 00:27:04,814
Zach was my best friend.

311
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:09,152
But we're still part of the agency.
We have to follow orders.

312
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:13,120
But you're willing to disobey orders
if the operation calls for it, right?

313
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:14,955
No, bending the rules
is one thing.

314
00:27:14,957 --> 00:27:18,128
Disobeying a direct order
is something else entirely.

315
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:22,163
Yeah, well, if we leave now, guys, we're
gonna lose everything we have on Orsetti.

316
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:25,701
You don't actually hold
that information yourself.

317
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,436
The company
has that information.

318
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,574
And we will be able to move forward
in a different way in the future.

319
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:36,710
How many more innocent people will
get butchered if we leave now?

320
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:38,178
So what do you suggest, Anna?

321
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,347
- We don't accept reassignment.
- [man scoffs]

322
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:42,185
We stay here and finish this.

323
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:46,219
For those of you who would like
to follow the orders

324
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:48,021
that we have been given,

325
00:27:48,023 --> 00:27:49,990
we will be getting on the jet,

326
00:27:49,992 --> 00:27:51,957
and we will head back to Langley

327
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:56,965
where you will be retrained
and reassigned... separately.

328
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,235
This team is being disbanded.

329
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:04,673
[echoing] You will no
longer work together.

330
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:07,743
The plane is at 0900.

331
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:10,179
I expect to see
each of you there.

332
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:13,112
You know what? You guys
can do whatever you want.

333
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:15,883
I'm going after Orsetti
with or without you.

334
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:19,819
I'm not an agent.

335
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:21,654
I'm just an asset, all right?

336
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:23,256
So if you want me
to leave with you,

337
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:25,326
you're gonna have
to throw my ass back in jail.

338
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,828
I'm leaving, guys.

339
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:35,670
Asia's my home.
I'm not leaving.

340
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:45,246
She's right.

341
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,713
If the agency wants us
out of Asia, we're out.

342
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:49,984
There's nothing more
to talk about.

343
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:52,620
I'll be there.

344
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:05,633
If we leave now,
then Zach's death means nothing.

345
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:17,845
So you don't like cowboys.

346
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:25,085
Jake.

347
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,153
Whatever you decide,
I'm with you.

348
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:29,357
It's your call, mate.

349
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:32,056
But if we leave now,

350
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:35,862
we're gonna lose everything we
have on that scumbag Orsetti.

351
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:15,901

00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,275
Yeah, it's me.

355
00:30:24,243 --> 00:30:25,377
I, uh...

356
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:27,313
can't come now.

357
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:31,984
I don't know yet.

358
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:36,222
Maybe not for a few weeks.

359
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:40,427
Sorry.

360
00:30:46,865 --> 00:30:48,000
[bell tolls]

361
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:58,310
[door opens]

362
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,514
[door closes]

363
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:31,909
[tolling continues]

364
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,182
[in Italian]
[echoing] Fuck you!

365
00:31:40,184 --> 00:31:41,953
Let's make a deal?

366
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:45,888
- [Zach screams]
- [tolling continues]

367
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,958
[sobs]

368
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:54,098
[sniffles, sobbing]

369
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:01,204
[Zach screams]

370
00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:35,305
[sniffles]
I lost a good friend, Father.

371
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:39,008
I'm sorry to hear that.

372
00:32:40,478 --> 00:32:42,979
We will pray
for his eternal repose.

373
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:46,283
I've sinned again...

374
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:48,418
Father.

375
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:52,088
[sighs]

376
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,525
[sniffles] I took a man's life.

377
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,929
[tolling continues]

378
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:12,908
[man shouts] <i>Zach!</i>

379
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,048
- You okay, hon?
- Yeah.

380
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:21,050
I'm making some coffee.

381
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:24,186
Fuck the coffee, Charlie.
Just get me a whiskey.

382
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,255
Okay. You got it.

383
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:50,279
[sighs]

384
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:08,963
I'm not sure what to say,
Sonia.

385
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,331
Do you want to talk about it?

386
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,536
[scoffs]
There's nothing to say.

387
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,642
I was beginning to suspect,
but... but I didn't know.

388
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,076
None of us did.

389
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,312
He said we shouldn't
tell anybody.

390
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,217
He didn't want
to break protocol.

391
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:30,453
Zach was a good man.

392
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:32,487
We all loved him.

393
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:35,557
Not like I did, Anna.

394
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:40,761
[sobs] I didn't even know I
could love until I met Zach.

395
00:34:40,763 --> 00:34:42,030
[sniffles]

396
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:46,100
The whole of last year
doesn't even seem real.

397
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,637
Me, a con girl...

398
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:54,742
come out of jail...
turn CIA asset.

399
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,280
[inhales deeply]
Then I came here, and Zach...

400
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:04,818
He gave me hope.

401
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,087
[sobbing]

402
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,423
[sniffles]

403
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,623
I should've been there,
you know? I...

404
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,091
There was little things
I could've done.

405
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:15,562
I... I could've saved him.

406
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,732
You couldn't do
anything about it.

407
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,267
There's nothing you could do.

408
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:22,534
[sobbing continues]

409
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:23,504
Hey.

410
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:27,374
How am I gonna survive this?

411
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:32,446
We'll get through this, okay?

412
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:34,147
- [sniffles]
- Together.

413
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:37,084
Our team is your family now.

414
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:39,753
Zach would want you
to know that.

415
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:46,424
[tolling continues]

416
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:48,393
[punches landing]

417
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:50,029
What was that bullshit
with Thompson?

418
00:35:55,302 --> 00:35:56,635
I'm talking to you.

419
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:58,405
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

420
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:01,040
You're meant to be one of us.

421
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,075
What the fuck
is one of us, man?

422
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:05,744
You're meant to be part
of the same family.

423
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,579
What the fuck
is the family, man?

424
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,147
The people who've been looking
after you all these years.

425
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:12,351
Yeah,
like we looked after Zach.

426
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:15,621
Zach knew the risks.

427
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:20,561
- You're angry, aren't you?
- [panting]

428
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:24,263
Hey.

429
00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:26,699
We're all angry.

430
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:29,601
- Now grow up.
- Oh, come on.

431
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:30,869
And deal with it!

432
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:32,071
[shouts]

433
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,739
Don't you remember?
Jake took you in.

434
00:36:35,741 --> 00:36:37,908
Man, he's had enough.
He's gonna get us all killed.

435
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,743
You little Marine shit.

436
00:36:39,745 --> 00:36:41,314
- [grunts]
- [groans]

437
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:44,216
- We're not doing this today.
- [grunts]

438
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:46,285
[shouts]

439
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:50,121
[coughs]

440
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:52,091
Now calm down.

441
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:54,625
You know what Jake's
going through?

442
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:55,795
We're all going through it!

443
00:36:56,662 --> 00:36:58,729
Now pull yourself together.

444
00:36:58,731 --> 00:36:59,432
Stay down!

445
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,599
And I expect to see you
tomorrow.

446
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:04,203
I'm done with this shit!

447
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:06,606
Be a man and not a boy.

448
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:10,810
Grow up!

449
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:13,278
[grunts angrily]

450
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:30,761
Benton wants
to meet up later. You down?

451
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:34,497
Nope. Not tonight.
I'm, uh, just gonna take it easy.

452
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,199
Take it ea...
Since when do you take it easy?

453
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:37,802
[chuckling]
Don't look at me like that.

454
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,902
What is this?
You holding out on me?

455
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:41,306
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

456
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:44,809
I'll catch you tomorrow, buddy, huh?
I'm out of here.

457
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:46,311
[laughs]

458
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:48,212
All right.

459
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,814
[chuckles]

460
00:37:56,388 --> 00:37:57,489
[tolling continues]

461
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:04,596
I fight evil every day, Father.

462
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:11,335
And I feel like I'm losing
myself to the dark side.

463
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:15,572
Have faith in God's wisdom.

464
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:19,744
[sniffles] I don't know
what God has in store for me.

465
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:23,614
[priest] God has plans
for all of us...

466
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:25,716
and for you.

467
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:31,319
[woman crying,
shouting in Tagalog] No!

468
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:32,587
[in Tagalog]
Please! I'm begging you!

469
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:34,256
[man] Don't be stubborn,
you'll get hurt!

470
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:35,559
- [woman] Don't do this to me!
- [Lopez] Hey!

471
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,461
- [in Tagalog] Hey! Let her go!
- [man] Come on, you whore!

472
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:40,598
What? Stay out of this!
[groans]

473
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,500
[screams]

474
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:50,239
- Are you hurt? Go home.
- Thank you, ma'am.

475
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:59,382
[engine starts]

476
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:15,298
[sighs]

477
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:44,427
[seagulls squawk]

478
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:46,896
[woman]
It's good to see you, Jake.

479
00:39:47,563 --> 00:39:49,464
So what brings you to Hong Kong?

480
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,400
Well, I have some stuff going on,
and I thought I could use your help.

481
00:39:53,402 --> 00:39:55,503
- I know that I...
- [shutter clicks]

482
00:39:55,505 --> 00:39:59,673
passed up your offer on running your
security operations before, last year.

483
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:01,041
[woman chuckles]

484
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:03,043
Yes, unfortunately, you did.

485
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:05,846
- But you know what? Things change.
- [clicking continues]

486
00:40:05,848 --> 00:40:06,983
Now we have something better.

487
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,484
I have a proposition for you.

488
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:12,119
Okay, I am all ears.

489
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:14,589
- I'd like to you to fund...
- [clicking continues]

490
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:17,558
and start up
a special company for me.

491
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,993
Start up?

492
00:40:18,995 --> 00:40:22,597
[laughs] Jake, at your age?

493
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:27,602
Recently one of my guys...
was killed on the last mission.

494
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:31,071
Kid's been with me
for a long time.

495
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:32,873
He was like a son to me.
I really loved him.

496
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:33,875
I see.

497
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:37,610
So you want revenge?

498
00:40:37,612 --> 00:40:40,348
Revenge is for young guys.

499
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:45,152
This is about something
much bigger than revenge.

500
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:47,022
It's about what's right
in the world.

501
00:40:48,623 --> 00:40:51,623
CIA wants us out of here,
wants us out of Asia.

502
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:52,761
We're just not gonna do that.

503
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:54,996
Why don't you come
work for me, huh?

504
00:40:56,464 --> 00:40:59,599
I pay you six figures, and you are
going to have a beautiful life.

505
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:01,767
You're gonna be my boss,

506
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,470
and you're gonna have
six guys working under me.

507
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:07,740
- [laughs] Now we're talking.
- [chuckles]

508
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:10,475
So, how much
are we talking about?

509
00:41:10,477 --> 00:41:13,912
Uh, I... I need about $5 million
to start up the company.

510
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:16,883
[laughing] Five million.

511
00:41:16,885 --> 00:41:18,618
I would say...

512
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,722
So it's a very much
elite, elite agency, right?

513
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,992
Jake, look.

514
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:29,396
After my father died, you saved my
life, and I never forget this.

515
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:33,732
You will have the money
on one condition.

516
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:37,502
I become a full partner
in this whole deal.

517
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:38,871
- [in Russian] Okay.
- Full on.

518
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:40,006
[in Russian] Deal.

519
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:41,573
I will finance

520
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:43,209
a beautiful,
beautiful office for you.

521
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:45,077
We'll make it very stylish

522
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,945
because I think you're
gonna need a lot of help

523
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:48,849
now that you'll be financed
by a woman.

524
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:50,916
- [laughs]
- [in Russian] It's true.

525
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:53,785
So, where do you want
this office.

526
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:55,687
Uh, Bangkok?

527
00:41:55,689 --> 00:41:56,757
Manila.

528
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,861
Did you know that I own
some property there?

529
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:03,527
That does not surprise me.

530
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:04,465
Listen.

531
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:06,965
Why don't you call your guys?

532
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:09,103
Tell them that I'm sending
the plane for them.

533
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,537
- [in Russian] Thank you very much.
- [laughs]

534
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:15,441
And you and I will cruise
on my beautiful yacht,

535
00:42:15,943 --> 00:42:18,411
and we'll meet them in Manila.

536
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:21,748
[clicks tongue] I like the sound of
it, partner.

537
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:24,450
[together, in Russian]
Cheers.

538
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:35,192
[Thompson] Where is Jake?
Where is Jake?

539
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:36,596
Where is Alexander?

540
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:40,564
Where is Jake?

541
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:42,833
[Thompson echoing]
<i>Where is Alexander?</i>

542
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:44,635
I don't know where he is.

543
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:47,707
- Where is Alexander?
- I don't know where he is!

544
00:42:48,507 --> 00:42:49,676
[sighs]

545
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,010
[Thompson echoing]
<i>You're lying to me.</i>

546
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:53,111
I'm your CIA handler.

547
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:55,247
You think I don't know you
[echoes] inside and out?

548
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:56,916
[Thompson echoing]
<i>You know where he is.</i>

549
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,983
You're lying to me.

550
00:42:58,985 --> 00:42:59,986
Harrison.

551
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:04,189
I want answers.

552
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:05,756
You're my straight arrow.

553
00:43:05,758 --> 00:43:07,459
You're the guy
that always follows by the book.

554
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:10,930
These guys don't play
by the rules.

555
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,865
You know,
the book doesn't work.

556
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,867
[Thompson]
The rules have changed.

557
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:19,136
Yeah, the world's changed.
We're too far behind.

558
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,805
Help me do something about it.

559
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,672
Instead of reassigning us
somewhere else...

560
00:43:22,674 --> 00:43:24,874
I'm trying, but every damn one
of you is standing in my way.

561
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:25,911
Finish the...

562
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:30,482
Finish the mission. [sighs]

563
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:35,654
They killed Zach, Thompson!

564
00:43:36,755 --> 00:43:39,790
Help me do something about it.
Where is Alexander?

565
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:41,891
I don't know where he is!

566
00:43:41,893 --> 00:43:44,161
And if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

567
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:48,631
Now, if we're gonna be much longer,
I'm gonna need a burger or something,

568
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:49,968
'cause I'm starving.

569
00:43:50,302 --> 00:43:51,203
We done?

570
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:02,644
[together, in Italian]
Cheers!

571
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:03,913
Cheers!

572
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:05,550
[in Italian]
To old memories, old times.

573
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:08,018
Milan, but especially Paris.

574
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,220
Do you remember Paris?

575
00:44:10,222 --> 00:44:11,787
What we did in Paris?

576
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:12,888
No, no, no, no.

577
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,723
[laughing]

578
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:16,793
You were tremendous.

579
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:18,228
Very good.

580
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,930
- Really good.
- What does it remind you of?

581
00:44:20,932 --> 00:44:22,631
- Oh, pasta.
- Oh, pasta.

582
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:24,033
- Finally.
- Great.

583
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:25,768
We are Italians.
If we don't eat pasta...

584
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,969
Good, good, yes.

585
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:28,238
The other surprise
I have for you...

586
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,239
she's my daughter.

587
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:30,606
[Orsetti sighs, laughs]

588
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:33,209
- My pleasure.
- Giada.

589
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:34,777
- You are beautiful.
- Thank you.

590
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:36,378
- [father] She's Italian.
- Eh...

591
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,851
It's best you go to the
customers waiting for you, okay?

592
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:42,818
Thank you.

593
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,119
And now? Now the pasta.

594
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:46,055
Yes, a bit of pasta.

595
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:47,024
Come on.

596
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:49,358
Come on, Santino.

597
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,660
- Come on, Santino.
- Thank you.

598
00:44:51,662 --> 00:44:54,129
- Isn't it too much, Santino?
- [Orsetti] Yes, Santino is hungry.

599
00:44:54,131 --> 00:44:56,732
It's too good.
I'm gonna have some more.

600
00:44:56,734 --> 00:44:58,702
[in English] Mao, my friend.

601
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,038
Ciao.
Long time we don't see you.

602
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,577
I have to go to the other customers.
Just talk about business.

603
00:45:06,977 --> 00:45:07,878
Please.

604
00:45:24,227 --> 00:45:26,096
How long you been
working for me...

605
00:45:27,063 --> 00:45:27,965
now?

606
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:29,766
Almost two years, huh?

607
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:32,136
Yes, sir.

608
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:39,740
And how much money have you make
during this time?

609
00:45:39,742 --> 00:45:41,278
$300,000.

610
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:48,952
Not bad, huh?

611
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:52,087
So, for that kind of money,

612
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:54,391
I expect a response now.

613
00:45:56,226 --> 00:45:58,328
I have a very simple question
for you.

614
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,397
Who killed my men?

615
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,034
Nobody's talking now.

616
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:08,670
These people are not from here.

617
00:46:09,305 --> 00:46:12,007
So, basically,
you come to see me,

618
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:14,109
and you have no answer for me.

619
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:17,914
[in Italian] You are like a
fork in the soup. Useless.

620
00:46:28,024 --> 00:46:30,692
[Mao choking]

621
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:23,345
[cell phone ringing]

622
00:47:30,085 --> 00:47:31,186
Hello?

623
00:47:31,386 --> 00:47:32,387
It's me.

624
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:35,423
He's back in Bangkok.

625
00:47:39,327 --> 00:47:40,895
We've got a short window.

626
00:47:42,397 --> 00:47:44,131
Do what needs to be done.

627
00:47:47,568 --> 00:47:48,869
Yes, sir.

628
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,954
[whistling]

629
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:43,323
[man] Hi. How you doing?

630
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:47,193
Hey, you cannot go inside.

631
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,327
- Speak English?
- No.

632
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:50,363
[grunts]

633
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:53,501
[neck snaps]

634
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:34,106
[car alarm chirps]

635
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:44,149
[groans]

636
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,398
[shouts]

637
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,341
[cell phone ringing]

638
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,047
[Jake on phone] <i>Hayes.</i>

639
00:50:17,049 --> 00:50:19,318
<i>Listen to me, you motherfucker.</i>

640
00:50:20,152 --> 00:50:25,154
I know all of your fucking immoral,
dirty, rotten, criminal shit,

641
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:26,324
and I don't care.

642
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:28,625
I got my own fish to fry.

643
00:50:28,627 --> 00:50:31,661
<i>You sent somebody to kill me,
and you missed.</i>

644
00:50:31,663 --> 00:50:33,331
<i>You know what that means.</i>

645
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,433
You make another fucking move
or blink the wrong way,

646
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:38,601
I will kill you.

647
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,404
I will kill your fucking mother.

648
00:50:40,406 --> 00:50:42,306
I will kill your fucking dog.

649
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,308
[line clicks, cell phone beeps]

650
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,314
[Spanish man] You're in Marbella now.
You have to learn this.

651
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:54,051
I just said,
"What beautiful eyes."

652
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:57,155
- Cheers, mama.
- Cheers.

653
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,061
[cell phone rings]

654
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:08,032
- [in Spanish] Yes?
- [Benton on phone] <i>Hi, Alberto.</i>

655
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,366
<i>Long time no speak.</i>

656
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:11,333
Tom.

657
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:13,036
<i>Tom Benton.</i>

658
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:15,036
[in Spanish] Hello, friend.
[in English] Are you here in Marbella?

659
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,074
I need to ask a favor.

660
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:19,243
Ah.

661
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,012
Are you still friends
with the Camorra Mafia?

662
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,147
[in Spanish] Yes.

663
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,550
I need to get in touch
with a guy called Orsetti.

664
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,318
- I know him.
- <i>We need a meeting with him.</i>

665
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,256
I have a very unique product
for a very special customer.

666
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:35,492
I'll send you the details
via WhatsApp.

667
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,358
[in Spanish] All right.

668
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,793
Time is the essence, mate.

669
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,196
Let me know if it's possible.

670
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:41,262
<i>Okay.</i>

671
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,598
It'd be good to see you.

672
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,668
I'll see you soon.

673
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:45,669
[in Spanish] Bye, my friend.

674
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,337
[cell phone beeps]

675
00:52:50,566 --> 00:52:52,368
[no audio]

676
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:15,422
[Jake] All right, good morning, everybody.
We're starting our first operation,

677
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:17,324
which is an intel-gathering op.

678
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:20,159
We are doing this one
from scratch.

679
00:53:20,161 --> 00:53:23,329
Orsetti was part of the Neapolitan
Camorra crime syndicate.

680
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:25,598
For the last two years,
he's been off the radar.

681
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,801
This is Orsetti's top dog.

682
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:32,471
Phnom Penh police chief has confirmed
that he has been assassinated.

683
00:53:32,473 --> 00:53:33,774
Killed in Cambodia.

684
00:53:33,776 --> 00:53:35,508
Then there's
a third unknown person

685
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,842
to Orsetti's
immediate circle,

686
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:38,878
a computer hacker.

687
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,882
I started tracking him using deep
web sites, but he's since gone dark.

688
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:46,218
The general public uses search
engines to access indexed results,

689
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,921
mostly certified
and registered web sites.

690
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:52,093
It's what we commonly refer to
as the World Wide Web.

691
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,327
Then there's the deep web...

692
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:57,630
databases, software, web sites,
and non-indexed content

693
00:53:57,632 --> 00:54:00,231
that's not accessible
through standard search engines.

694
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:02,467
This is actually
the majority of the Internet.

695
00:54:02,469 --> 00:54:04,570
Most of this information
is private,

696
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,906
kind of like your network,
Miss Sokolov.

697
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:08,841
Then there's the dark web.

698
00:54:08,843 --> 00:54:11,677
Think of it like the Mariana
Trench of the Internet.

699
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,681
This content is heavily encrypted
and private network access only.

700
00:54:15,683 --> 00:54:18,784
The dark web is where anonymous
buyers use cryptocurrencies,

701
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:21,252
<i>like Bitcoin,
Ripple, and Litecoin,</i>

702
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:24,424
<i>to buy guns, drugs, and organs.</i>

703
00:54:25,258 --> 00:54:27,862
All anonymous, all untraceable.

704
00:54:28,429 --> 00:54:30,930
[Anna] That's where I lost
track of Orsetti's operation.

705
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:34,934
At the moment, I can't trace him or
the hacker behind his transactions.

706
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:36,901
Okay, so right now
I have a play in place.

707
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:39,237
It's a guy called Alberto.

708
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,574
We have a meeting scheduled
with him immediately.

709
00:54:41,576 --> 00:54:43,477
If we're lucky,
Orsetti will come.

710
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:46,580
Benton, you remember that guy
we had lunch with in Burma?

711
00:54:46,813 --> 00:54:49,948
See if you can set him up
to deliver some supplies to us.

712
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,184
No problem.

I'm just so busy
with the church.

[mother] I know that.

720
00:56:37,522 --> 00:56:40,693
How about you, Maria?
Did you meet someone from abroad?

721
00:56:41,493 --> 00:56:42,995
Now that you're here...

722
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:46,598
you should think about
staying here for good.

723
00:56:47,398 --> 00:56:49,832
Your father and I,
we're not getting any younger.

724
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:51,971
[in Tagalog] Mom,
I really need to stay in Manila.

725
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:55,974
Why don't you want to stay here?

726
00:56:57,041 --> 00:57:00,643
Mom, you know I have work there.

727
00:57:00,645 --> 00:57:04,616
You should not let your work
take over your life.

728
00:57:11,122 --> 00:57:12,822
Mom, I already told you...

729
00:57:12,824 --> 00:57:15,027
Maria, I'm your mother.

730
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:19,063
You cannot lie to me!

731
00:57:21,032 --> 00:57:24,334
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

732

Mom...

733
00:57:26,003 --> 00:57:26,971

Hmm?

735
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:31,475
I want my family.

736
00:57:33,077 --> 00:57:34,745
We're still family, right?

737
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:38,983
Family? We're not family!

738
00:57:42,419 --> 00:57:44,855
Yes, I have two children.

739
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,892
I offer one to God.

740
00:57:52,462 --> 00:57:56,800
And the devil took the other.

Orsetti's not gonna
make him wait for long.
