1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,443
My name is Darcy.

2
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:15,214
And this, is the end.

3
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,349
I know what
you're thinking.

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,184
She has the cute guy.

5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,121
So life must
be pretty great.

6
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,756
Would you like to try
some of mine?

7
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:26,125
And you know what?

8
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,193
I used to believe that.

9
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:36,201
I used to think that up until
you found your soul mate,

10
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,637
-nothing was really complete.
-This is to die for.

11
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,673
But, it's not about
the guys at all.

12
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,675
In fact,
fuck guys.

13
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,678
It's about your friends.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,747
You're gonna call
me a man-hater.

15
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:52,051
But that couldn't be
further from the truth.

16
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,388
I love men.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,059
If anything,
i love them too much.

18
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,829
And that's what
got me into trouble.

19
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,798
I really was
having a good time.

20
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,310
But for you
to understand,

21
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,279
we have to go back
to the beginning.

22
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,778
--I've never had
the best of luck with men.

23
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,915
But, if I'm being
truthful with myself,

24
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,184
that's probably my fault.

25
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,654
I mean, look at me, bringing
flowers to my boyfriend

26
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,889
on our anniversary.

27
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,457
Sucker.

28
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,825
I was sweet, naive,

29
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,496
and maybe just
a little bit stupid.

30
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,630
That's why in life,

31
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,865
you need someone
to come in

32
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,334
and give you
a big dose of reality.

33
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,636
What the fuck?

34
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,405
Uh, why aren't
you at work?

35
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,839
Well,
this is awkward.

36
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,275
I was hoping to be clothed
when I finally met you.

37
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,743
Excuse me?

38
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,779
Well, there's pictures
of you in the living room,

39
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,314
and,
i was almost jealous,

40
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,816
but Jeremy explained
that you're his sister.

41
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,986
And you're--
you're really pretty.

42
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,554
What the fuck
is going on?

43
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,225
-She's um--
-I'm his girlfriend.

44
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:49,361
I can't blame her for
giving me the crazy eyes.

45
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,929
I'd probably do
the same thing.

46
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,799
-Baby, it's not what
it looks like--
-baby?

47
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,934
Yeah, right?
Three months?

48
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,836
How about three years?

49
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,606
You're not his sister.

50
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,875
This is just a one time thing,
i don't-- I barely know her.

51
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,978
I-- Kate, honestly,
it was just this one time

52
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,713
i-- it was just one time.
It was a mistake,

53
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,381
I made a mistake.

54
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,650
What, well, you couldn't
have chosen somebody better?

55
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,353
Baby, no one's better
than you, right?

56
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:18,423
-I mean, look at her, she's
a bit porky, don't you think?
-Hey.

57
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,392
- What are you
talking about--

58
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,461
- this is
so humiliating!

59
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,696
And that was
my first threesome.

60
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,867
♪ See your heart beat
through your chest ♪

61
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,702
♪ and I feel like
I'm your prey ♪

62
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,608
♪ you've got me
by the neck ♪

63
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,977
♪ and I don't
wanna get away... ♪

64
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,749
Does she know
you're talking to me?

65
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:47,753
In my life, Nora
was the big sister.

66
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,521
Theatrically
over-protective.

67
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:54,326
I just don't really know
if polyamorous is my thing.

68
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,594
If that's the word.

69
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,663
Um, yeah, I guess
i could do dinner,

70
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,866
with both of you,
on satur-- ow--

71
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,534
no, why are you
even calling her?

72
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,935
You are not man enough
for one woman,

73
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,537
much less two,
or twenty, or whatever.

74
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,838
What do you think
this is, "big love"?

75
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,640
You can't have
a million girlfriends.

76
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,741
Leave Darcy alone,
all right?

77
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,009
She's way better
than you.

78
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,644
Consider yourself blocked.

79
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,413
Bye.

80
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,447
-Trade?
-Yeah.

81
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,382
Okay.

82
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,518
Seriously though,
you should probably
block him.

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,522
Really? Thank you.

84
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:26,758
You're welcome.
You deserve a lot
better than that.

85
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,063
Really? Another dud?

86
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:35,367
The last guy was literally
tindering during dinner.

87
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,769
Why can't we
just pick for her?

88
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,105
That's strike three, Nora.

89
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,774
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

90
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,576
Really?
'Cause of this?

91
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,346
Management just saw
the donut petition.

92
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,748
I just said that I think
there should be donuts.

93
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,051
-Nora...
-It was discriminatory to have
bagels and not donuts.

94
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,355
You petitioned the staff to
get management to buy donuts.

95
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,657
I like my morning
with frosting and sprinkles.

96
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,360
Last month, it was the amount
of creamer options in here,

97
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,762
and how much time is given
for paternity leave.

98
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,831
I'm a woman
of the people.

99
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,933
Not anymore,
you aren't.

100
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,502
Management is concerned
that you aren't as passionate
about your work,

101
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:13,672
as you are about
the break room supplies
and the staff policy.

102
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,643
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,962
How many of these
do you think I can fit
in my mouth at once?

104
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,630
Ready for more?

105
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,399
-Please fit them
all in there.
-Mmm, round four.

106
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,933
Then there was Olivia.

107
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,569
She was more like
the matriarch of the group.

108
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,004
All right, ladies,

109
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,172
raise your glasses.

110
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,474
Here's to a new chapter.

111
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,042
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

112
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,145
She claimed to know
what was best.

113
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,614
And she was usually right.

114
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,450
How about more about
how you're a metrosexual,
'cause he's definitely Metro.

115
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,519
She seemed to have
the perfect life.

116
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,988
Complete with
friends just like her.

117
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,656
-You called him out.
-You revealed one
of your secrets.

118
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,626
I'm just telling you,
I'm not gonna drive,

119
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,060
-he's driving.
-Oh.

120
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,530
-This was amazing.
-It was.

121
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,199
-Thank you so much,
you guys, for having us.
-Anytime.

122
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,668
-Next time it's at
our place, okay?
-Okay.

123
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,936
No, it was a pleasure.

124
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,438
We don't see you guys
often enough.

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,074
You guys are so precious.

126
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,010
Hey, when are we gonna
go golfing again?

127
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,045
-Megan just bought me
a new driver.
-I'll call you.

128
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,548
And we're gonna have lunch
while these guys are out.

129
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,849
-You and me.
-I'd like that.

130
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,551
-Aw.
-Take care.

131
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,885
-Take care, you guys, see you.
-Bye, thanks again.

132
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,620
Drive safely.

133
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,091
They're so cute.

134
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,092
He's so nice,
isn't he?

135
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,662
He is.

136
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,896
Babe, can you pour
me a drink?

137
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,498
Are you sure
you need another one?

138
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,800
Please don't
make me ask again.

139
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,569
I'm just saying,
i don't think you need
another drink.

140
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,671
There you go,
thinking again.

141
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,675
Are you listening to me?

142
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,747
Look at me when
i talk to you.

143
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,083
Wipe that look
off your face, or
I'll do it for you.

144
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,886
I'm not gonna do this
with you again.

145
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,755
Okay?

146
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:24,102
But we all have our secrets.

147
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,212
And back to
the parents' house, again.

148
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,182
The secret's out.

149
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:42,687
--Thanks.

150
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,856
I wish I was just visiting.

151
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,691
Ow.

152
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,793
-Let's go hustle.
-All right.

153
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,295
Hurry, hurry.

154
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,267
Got milk.

155
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,302
--Delete that, right now.

156
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,770
We were a family.

157
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,005
Oh my god, you guys.
Do you remember?

158
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,239
My grill?

159
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,308
They called me
"metalmouth" for years.

160
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,876
Here's Olivia.

161
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,745
Sophisticated,
personified.

162
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,281
-Aw.
-Not here.

163
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,616
We put our friendship
above everything.

164
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,018
Including our love lives.

165
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,220
Is that Andy
in the background?

166
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,155
Ooh.

167
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,757
That's definitely him.

168
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,958
That was the year
before we met you.

169
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,693
Before Andy became
a shit stain.

170
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:22,928
-Do you remember
that day?
-No.

171
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,096
I was so mortified.

172
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,765
I can't believe anyone
believed that rumor, anyways.

173
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,667
Like I'd make animal
noises during sex.

174
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,168
He was obviously lying.

175
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,137
That takes more
coordination than you have.

176
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,805
True, true,
all of the breathing,

177
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,841
and the movement,
and the barnyard noises.

178
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,743
Watch out, or you will wake up
naked, tied to a porch,

179
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,078
like dear old Andy.

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,147
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

181
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,815
Cocksucker deserved it.

182
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,150
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:52,290
Speaking of cocksuckers.

185
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,925
Here's Johnny.

186
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,864

187
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,970
Olivia!

188
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,128
Come on baby,
let me in.

189
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:35,000
I called the cops,
they're already on their way.

190
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,868
Fuck!

191
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,107

-Hiking? She doesn't hike.
-Okay, but men love it.

196
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,098

She's not gonna
go for this.

198

This is an intervention.
She doesn't have to like it.

00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,671
You're gonna help her
meet her mate.

Is that actually a site?

203
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,145
You're already
online dating.

204
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,846

207
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,951
I have pigtails
in my profile picture.

208
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,421
But blair101 likes them.

209
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,060
He's a little cute, okay.

210
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,929
As a matter of fact,
he's quite attractive.

211
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,098
He's on
an online dating site.

212
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,334
That's never stopped
you before.

213
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,271
Fine, whatever.
Set it up.

214
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,939
Yes!

215
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,341
-Yup.
-No hiking dates.

216
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,353
-So, it's official?
-Yep.

217
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,856
Uh, technically
it has to go through
the system first,

218
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,825
but I am on my way
to being a divorcée.

219
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,127
Mmm!

220
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,361
Mmm!

-Here's to freedom.
-To freedom.

222
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:19,204
Mmm! Speaking of men,
how was your date last night?

223
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,939
Yes, how was it?

224
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,874
Was he as cute
as his pictures online?

225
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,043
Are you referring
to the Adonis that
you set me up with?

226
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,011
You could have prepared me.

227
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,047
I mean, you can't transition
me from geeks to gods

228
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,248
overnight.

229
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,851
So how did our man do?

230
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,119
He seems great.

231
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,020
I don't really
know him, but,

232
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,322
he seems sweet so far.

233
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,190
Mmm! Yes!

234
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,391
You see,
all you needed

235
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,193
was Nora's
matchmaking services.

236
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,496
Maybe I'll set you up next.

237
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,499
No. Focus on one couple
at a time, cupid.

238
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,435
-Mmm.
-Don't, we just
started dating.

239
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,238
You love him.
You love him.

240
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,940
Okay, let's not pat ourselves
on the back prematurely.

241
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,343
-Love.
-Please, stop.

242
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,811
All right, Nora,
you're all done.

243
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,045
-I'll see you up front.
-Thank you.

Oh.

-That's my bumper sticker.

00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,296
-Your bumper sticker?
-Yeah, my ex wasn't
really a fan.

261
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,530
He kinda
said it was like

262
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,199
putting a bumper sticker
on a Bentley.

263
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:57,468
A Bentley? Well,
at least that's flattering.

264
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,038
Yeah, I guess,
if you like gas-guzzling,
status symbols,

265
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,239
then, sure, why not?

266
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,842
Somebody is
a spitfire today.

267
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,043
Well, maybe so.

268
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,979
-So, what's your deal?
-My deal?

269
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:12,050
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're
on a dating site. Why?

270
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,118
I could ask you
the same question.

271
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,554
Avoidance,
that's fine.

272
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,290
Okay.
No particular reason.

273
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:23,261
I just haven't found
what I was looking for.

274
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:27,866
I want the kind
of relationship that
my parents have.

275
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,368
And up until now,
i didn't think I could
find that with anyone.

276
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,108
Okay, no. No.
Okay, that's like
the worst thing

277
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,010
that you could
do to a photographer.

278
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,279
You know what?
I could get used to
being around you.

279
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,214
You're kind of special.

280
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,350
Like this kind of special?

281
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,085
I think that is
a really good look for you.

282
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,152
You should start
doing that more often.

283
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,520
Thank you.
You know what?

284
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,223
My normal face doesn't
always work for me.

285
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,926
I think it's pretty great.

286
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:02,166

It means welcome

This is my casbah.

292
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,668
I blame you for
the general clumsiness.

293
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,137
Moi? No, no, no, no, no.

294
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,945
-Why?
-'Cause you make me nervous.

295
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,369
Come on, let's go.

296
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,074
Slave driver.

297
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,753
Okay, you're gonna
hit the pull-up bars

298
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,254
I'm gonna grab us
some waters.

299
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,357
-Aye, aye, captain.
-All right.

300
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,425
I hate pull-ups.

301
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,464

Can I pet him?

302
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:43,401
-Sure.
-Hi, corgi.

303
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,069
-This is nugget.
-Oh, I love corgis.

304
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,238
I follow, like,
60 on instagram.

305
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,307
-Oh, really?
-You should get one.

306
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,245
Maybe someday.

307
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,546
Your dog is awesome.
Thank you.

308
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,048
-Nice. Come on, buddy.
-Bye.

309
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,549
Have a nice day.

310
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,392
I thought you were
getting the waters.

311
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:11,095
Well, I didn't want to
interrupt you guys, you know.

312
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,563
Interrupt what?
I was just petting a dog.

313
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:20,338
Are you kidding?
Is this like,
a jealous joke?

314
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,675
Yeah. Gotcha.

315
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,211
I love you.

316
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,514
Yeah. I'm a little sweaty
though, so...

317
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,449
Right.

318
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,221
You know, Nora?

319
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,656
We live together, right?

320
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,658
So, maybe you
shouldn't be flirting

321
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,094
with all these
other guys all the time.

322
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:47,331
-Got it?
-Okay.

323
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,323
Well, that wasn't
part of the game plan.

324
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:16,861
I'm not complaining.

325
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,843
Leaving so soon?
I feel used.

326
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,412
Aren't we needy?
I'm just going to
the bathroom.

327
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,114
Well, then
you won't need this.

328
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,116
Maybe I'm shy?

329
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,718
You weren't so shy
five minutes ago.

330
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,394
Don't run into anything.

331
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,239
Excuse me,
having an emergency?

332
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,808
Something like that.

333
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,745
Hello, to you, too.
Miss me already?

334
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,148
Mmm, I can't.

335
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,784
Okay, I can't.
I can't.

336
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,420
I can't.

337
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,556
Okay, you broke
the box, seriously.

338
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,892
Just go with it.
It's a fantasy.

339
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,493
It's not mine.
Stop.

340
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,664

345

Spain is amazing,
maybe we'll stay.

346
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,305
So, how's the apartment
hunt going?

347
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,907
Call us and let us know
how you're doing, okay?

348

Don't get too comfy.

349
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,815
Baby, where are you?

350
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,351
--Olivia, you got
a fucking restraining order.

351
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,353
--You bitch!

352
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,359
All your messages
have been erased.

353
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,743
Yeah, hi.
I need to report
a break-in.

354
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,984
Jesus.

355
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:57,555
F-- fuck!

356
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:58,889
What's wrong?

357
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,992
Your shit is literally
everywhere, okay?

358
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,628
I can't even take
a fucking piss without
tripping over your stuff.

359
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,029
I was looking
for something.

360
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,632
How many nail polishes
do you actually need?

361
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,634
As many as I want.
That's my stuff. Stop.

362
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,870
Oh, it's your stuff?
Well, it's my house.

363
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,972
-Finally, you said it.
-Yeah, yeah. I said it.

364
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,607
It's my house.

365
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,842
And you're just--
you're just a fucking guest.

366
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,781
Hello? Are you okay?

367
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,752
Yeah, I can do that.

368
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,655
-Can we just continue this--
-yeah, later.

369
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:35,026
-Okay, okay.
-I still need to piss.

370
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,428
Okay,
I'll be right there.

371
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,729

378
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:09,994
He was here.

379
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:10,995
In this house.

380
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,563
In my parents' house.

381
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,799
Ugh, creepy.
Good thing they're not here.

382
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,400
He didn't know that.

383
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,702
I came home,

384
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,870
and this was open
to our wedding day,

385
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,772
he burned a cigarette
in my face.

386
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,408
I'm gonna stay here
with you tonight.

387
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,378
-You don't have to do that--
-no, things are really rough
with Ryan and I right now.

388
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,913
Is it okay if i
spend the night with you?

389
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,452
Like old times.

390
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,053
Yeah.

391
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,133
- Coffee! Oop.

392
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,134
How'd you sleep?

393
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,469
Okay. You?

394
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,537
Um, amazing.

395
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,439
I'm pretty much just gonna
hide your mom somewhere
in your backyard,

396
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,141
and live in her
pajamas forever.

397
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,943
--Your dad won't notice.

398
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,612
I have 17 messages
from Adam.

399
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,814
Hmm.
Only 17 today.

400
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,816
Yeah, but still
nothing from Darcy.

401
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,152
She did go on that date
with Mr. wonderful yesterday.

402
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,887
Maybe it's one of those
dates that never ends.

403
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,555
True, but there's
something off about it.

404
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,857
I don't know,
I'm getting worried.

405
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,425
Don't. Worrying
creates those frown lines,

406
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,727
and you do not want those.

407
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,529
Oh my god,
I'm gonna be late for work,

408
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,131
I have to get ready.

409
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:22,633
-Oh, thank you so much
for staying, I love you.
-Love you.

410
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,735
-Let me know if you hear
from Darcy, okay?
-Okay.

411
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,137
Thank you.

412
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,541
Clearly, I will not be
applying to be a barista.

413
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,923
Staff meeting's in five.
Are you coming?

414
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,495
Oh. Your
divorce papers came.

415
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,964
It would appear so.

416
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,568
Don't worry.
Marriage is an antiquated
institution, anyway.

417
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,037
Excuse me?

418
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,572
You're a person,
not chattel.

419
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,708
You're not meant
to be owned.

420
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,545
-How old is Adam?
-35.

421
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:08,946
Way too old.

422
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,015
The world is full
of gorgeous young men

423
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:13,918
who are very eager
to please.

424
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,019
Really?

425
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,754
Look at you,
you're gorgeous.

426
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,522
You deserve
to be worshipped.

427
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,825
I don't know, I just--

428
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,627
let me show you
Javier, my cub.

429
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,697
He's 26.

430
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,600
When he rolls his "r's,"
you can't even believe it.

431
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,101
It sounds like
he's purring.

432
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,071
Not that one,.

433
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:37,041

Hey, you.

438
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,582
Shit.

439
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:21,719
-Are you ready?
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

440
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,121
-You're kidding me.
-Oh, I completely forgot.

441
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:27,691
I-- I set this interview
up for you like a month ago.

442
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,593
Okay, we've got
like, 5 minutes.

443
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,262
I'm honestly not even
close to being ready.

444
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,731
I don't have my resume,
we don't even have paper
to print it on.

445
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,799
Okay, so, so
what am I supposed
to tell them?

446
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,968
Okay, because
this was a favor for me.

447
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,803
Tell them I came down
with something.

448
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,972
With this much notice?

449
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,808
Food poisoning?

450
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,180
Did you just get
your hair done?

451
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:54,151
-You noticed.
-No, no, no. Don't.

452
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:58,889
Look, I put my ass
on the line for you,
all right?

453
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,625
With a client of mine,
so that you could
get an interview,

454
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,228
and you forget,
because you're getting
your hair done.

455
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,163
Ugh! Hey.

456
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,332
Don't be angry.

457
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:11,101
I'm not angry,
all right, I'm-- I'm just--

458
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,604
I'm disappointed.

459
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,060
Do you have her spare key?

460
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,128
No, we drove all the way here,
and I forgot her spare key.

461
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,632
Because that isn't totally
something you would do?

462
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,167
Maybe she's dead.

463
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,868
Don't even say
shit like that.

464
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,136
We haven't heard
from her in two days.

465
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,038
Lighten up, warden.

466
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,641
-We never go two days.
-You're starting to sound
like my mother.

467
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:51,942
Oh, who would call
the police

468

having coffee.

501
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:54,231
I didn't know
we decided to be emo
this morning.

502
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,133
Um, we're both gonna
have bacon and eggs,

503
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,435
over easy, with
a side of toast.

504
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:01,271
-And then for the toast,
can you do wheat?
-Yeah.

505
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,906
And slightly toasted,

506
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,209
so, not lightly,
slightly.

507
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:06,944
And um,
a side of butter.

508
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,979
What kind of butter
do you have?

509
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,414
- Excuse me?
- -No, I mean, is it salted,

510
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,982
- or unsalted?
- -It's a diner.

511
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,051
- So, salted butter?
- -Sure.

512
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,919
-Okay, no butter, then.
-Okay.

513
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,188
Can I have the big
deluxe breakfast,

514
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,458
-with an extra
side of bacon?
-Got it.

515
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,060
And the bacon--
could I have it like,
a chewy,

516
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,796
-not super crispy?
-Chewy, not super crispy.

517
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:28,031
She's definitely going to
spit in our food this time.

518
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:31,201
Um, we'd also like
separate checks.

519
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,203
Of course you would.

520
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,838
Okay, what is going on?

521
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,006
I don't wanna talk
about it.

522
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,307
You have to talk about it.

523
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,176
You spend two days
in the same clothes,

524
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,878
I don't see how my
personal hygiene choices

525
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
have any impact on you.

526
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,181
When you smell
like you did,

527
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,049
you obviously have
something going on.

528
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,352
So just tell us what it is,
and maybe we can help you,

529
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:50,487
-that's why we're here.
-You know, I'm not gonna
do this with you.

530
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,131
Jesus, Liv.

531
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:16,980
I come in peace.

532
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,884
You're here
to interrogate me?

533
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:24,288
No, but, she's
right, right?

534
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,489
Here we go.

535
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,590
Just say it super quick.

536
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:27,858
Like ripping
off a band-aid.

537
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,960
Boom, done, go.

538
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,495
And, go!

539
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,030
I can't look at you.

540
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,998
This is harsh.

541
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,935
We did it.

542
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,403
Blair and I.

543
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,038
And this
is a bad thing?

544
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,376
Then he forced me
to do it again.

545
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,213
You're saying
he raped you?

546
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:52,416
I guess in theory,
that's the correct
terminology.

547
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:54,985
Tell me what happened.

548
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,053
Everything was fine,

549
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,356
then I got up to
go to the bathroom,

550
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:04,461
and i-- I said no,
and he did it anyway.

551
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:07,898
Are you kidding me?

552
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,200
I'm sorry, I know
i can be pushy sometimes--

553
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:14,171
-he raped her!
-Please, share it
with the world.

554
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:17,507
-I'm not the world.
-Yeah, I know.

555
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:20,611
But can we please
not phrase it like that?

556
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:23,547
Sorry, but how else
do you want that phrased?

557
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,949
I don't know.
Maybe I misunderstood.

558
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:29,419
Or maybe he misunderstood
the meaning of the word, "no."

559
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,888
Um, yeah, just a second.
We're leaving.

560
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,195
We could go to the cops.

561
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,963
Do I get to be a part
of this decision?

562
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,298
Well, we should
report this.

563
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,599
-Do you want to call,
or should I?
-Hello?

564
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,034
I'll do it.
Okay, I'm sorry--

565
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,169
what do you think you're
gonna tell them?

566
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,339
"Oh, hi, officer,
my friend was raped by the guy
that she was seeing.

567
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,141
Proof? Oh wait,
there isn't any,

568
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,576
because not only
did she shower,

569
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,078
but she had sex
with him prior.

570
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,347
Oh, and it happened
two days ago."

571
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,516
It's a good one.
You should go for it.

572
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,685
-Shit.
-Yeah, case closed.

573
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:03,520
Conversation done.
Commence moving on.

574
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,922
You should have
told us that

575
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,423
before I threw you
into the shower.

576
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,624
It wouldn't have
made a difference,

577
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,192
would it have
mattered anyway?

578
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,128
How do you prove that
you were raped by a guy

579
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,429
that you've already
had sex with?

580
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:21,071
Hello? No, it's just
me and the girls.

581
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:26,677
Oh, my god,
seriously?

582
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,545
They wouldn't
have believed me.

583
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,547
It wouldn't have
hurt to try.

584
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,282
It wouldn't
have hurt you.

585
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,520
I know I push you
sometimes, but,

586
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,155
it's just because
i care about you,

587
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,691
and I want
you to be protected.

588
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,559
I want him to know
what it feels like,

589
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,161
to just like
walk out into a world,

590
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,129
and like,
not feel safe anywhere.

591
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,565
-Shh.
-What'd I miss?

592
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,069
I want him to pay.

593
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,404
-Calling the cops.
-No.

594
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:55,973
So, not calling the cops.

595
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:59,009
No, we know
how useless they can be.

596
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,277
We're gonna
do it ourselves.

597
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,678
Ooh, diy project.

598
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
What the fuck do you mean,
"do it ourselves"?

599
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,983
I want to make him feel
the way that I feel now.

600
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,018
What do you propose?

601
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,088
Let's just give him
what he gave me.

602
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,558

you were looking

horrifically sorry.

694
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,323
-God that...
-Bitch.

695
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,425
Yeah, that and a medley
of other colorful words.

696
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,759
Here, let me, um...

697
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,629
Oh, no, thanks,
i-- I got it. I got it.

698
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,764
I got it. Thanks.

699
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,402
God,
i am terrible in crowds.

700
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:01,771
-Excuse me, what is--
-she is about to tell him

701
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,507
that he is going
to be a daddy, again.

702
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,478
I can't imagine you
being terrible anywhere.

703
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,013
Aren't you suave?

704
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,614
How about I buy
you a drink?

705
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,417
Why not?
Um, I'll have another beer.

706
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:15,752
You got it, babe. One beer.

707
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,956
-So, let's play a game.
-I like games.

708
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,826
How about you
guess how many months
I've been single,

709
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,861
and if you're right,
I'll chug my beer,

710
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,730
if you're wrong,

711
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:29,599
you have to take
a shot for every month
I've been single.

712
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,934
You've got a deal.

713
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,602
I think you're
gonna regret that.

714
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:35,505
I hope so.

715
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,741
Carlos, could you
line up some glasses?

716
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,382
Thanks.

717
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:46,916
You know, I could get used
to being around you.

718
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,752
You're kinda special.

719
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:52,055
Well, save the charm.
And take a guess, sir.

720
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,025
Three months.

721
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,762
Way wrong.

722
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,764
Three shots
of Tequila, please.

723
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,570
Here's to spilt beer.

724
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,048
♪ Keep walking
when you lose hope...♪

725
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,851
♪ keep walking
stand up... ♪

726
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,758
Did it work?
It didn't, did it?

727
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,594
He's not into her.

728
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,129
Oh, no,
he's into her.

729
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,999
It's the greatest accidental
first date I've seen.

730
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:39,436
Yeah. He's good with firsts--
first dates, first kisses,

731
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:40,737
first rapes.

732
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,605
We're ready.
Are you good to go?

733
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,508
Yeah. Coming now.

734
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,647
Somebody rebounds fast.

735
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:52,816
Special, my ass.

736
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,059
♪ Keep walking,
stand up re-load... ♪

737
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,197
♪ Keep walkin'... ♪

738
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,232
So, what do you say?
You wanna get out of here?

739
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,701
-We can get a ride to--
-my place?

740
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,103
Yeah.

741
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,805
Let's go.

742
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,889
Make sure you get
that one home safe.

743
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,524
Aw, leaving so soon?

744
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,526
I know. Girls night
has to continue elsewhere.

745
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:39,662
-All right.
-Thank you.

746
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,798
Always a pleasure.

747
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,604
The plan was simple.

748
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,539
Dump him in the desert
without his clothes,

749
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,841
so he had to hitch
back to town naked.

750
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,885
It's official--
my ass is going numb.

751
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:05,221
This is obviously
the unglamorous part
of this mission.

752
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:08,091
I went from bond girl
to babysitter.

753
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:11,160
Do we have an e.T.A.
On our mystery destination?

754
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,296
Yeah-- soon.

755
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,701
Are you seriously eating
nutty nutters right now?

756
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:19,869
Hoe-ing makes her hungry,

757
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,304
a mission
of this magnitude,

758
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,705
requires snacks.

759
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,941
Okay, focus on
the task at hand.

760
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,043
This culinary delight
that I am currently consuming

761
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,978
is for the benefit
of this group.

762
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,981
So I can be
a fully functioning--

763
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,650
okay, can't--
can't breathe, can't move.

764
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,218
Blair. Can't move.

765
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,686
This is officially
not sexy, or funny.

766
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,221
Ugh,
i can't breathe.

767
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,989
If you can yell,
you can definitely breathe.

768
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:42,759
Just help her.

769
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:43,726
Ugh.

770
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,233
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

771
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,334
Sit him upright.

772
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:53,169
It's not like
he's light.

773
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:57,040
-Use your softball arms.
-Hey, Nora just shut up
and do it.

774
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:17,193
Shit.

775
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,911
License
and registration?

776
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,783
Thanks.

777
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,321
You know why
i pulled you over?

778
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,625
You were
swerving slightly.

779
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,194
Really?

780
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,232
-Have you been drinking?
-No.

781
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:59,702
-You sure?
-Positive.

782
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:01,404
Where you all
coming from?

783
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,239
Barmaggedon.

784
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,041
But you weren't
drinking at this bar?

785
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,143
I drove to pick up
my drunk miscreant friends.

786
00:44:12,217 --> 00:44:16,052
- This true?
-Nutty nutters
taste like peanut butters!

787
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,722
I can't.

788
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,157
One and done,
they taste so fun.

789
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,926
How about that?
It's better than crack.

790
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,163
I really can't--
I'm allergic.

791
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,098
Bummer!

792
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,303
I might need to ask you
to step out of the car.

793
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:38,374
-Are you kidding?
-Nope.

794
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,018
Oh, my god.

795
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,060
Now, if you can please
walk into a straight line

796
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,728
towards me.

797
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,264
-Really?
-Yes, ma'am.

798
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,735
And, turn around
and walk back.

799
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,975
Stand with
your feet together.

800
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:14,277
Lift your right foot.

801
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,281
Feet back together.

802
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:20,983
Now, tilt your head back,
close your eyes,

803
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:24,087
touch your nose with
your right index finger.

804
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,423
Ma'am, that's not
your index finger.

805
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:30,893
Okay, quite frankly,
I'm feeling slightly harassed.

806
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,262
I attempt to keep some drunk
citizens off the street,

807
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,364
and this is how
i get repaid,

808
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,468
perhaps I should have
just let them mow down
a couple pedestrians.

809
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,205
Recite the alphabet
backwards.

810
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,373
Okay, you wanna know?
I can't do that.

811
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,944
And only a drunk person
would even attempt that.

812
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:51,914
This does not qualify
as flying under the radar.

813
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,317
At least
she is actually sober.

814
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,528
What happened?

815
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,997
- We traded numbers.
- -Playa, playa.

816
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:08,998
Oh, my god.

817
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,366
Still got it.

818
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,502
-Okay, can you not?
-Can you stop, please?

819
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:13,936
--Do not wave!

820
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,905
- Do not.

821
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,411
-Nora.
-Yes, sir?

822
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:26,048
-Why won't the car start?
-I don't know.

823
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,551
I don't know.
You're the one driving.

824
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,553
How long has
that light been on?

825
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:33,022
I think, like,
a couple months.

826
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:36,058
You've had your "check engine"
light on for a couple months?

827
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,894
How am I supposed to know
it's a "check engine" light?

828
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,061
--What?

829
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,263
It's not like
anyone tells you

830
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:41,998
what any of those
lights mean.

831
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,033
Okay, what now?

832
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:45,835
Abandon ship?

833
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:47,837
Um, we are not leaving my car
on the side of the road.

834
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,472
Sometimes it just needs
a couple minutes to cool down.

835
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,174
-A couple?
-Like, 20.

836
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,842
You're right-- let's sit
on the side of the road

837
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:56,145
until he wakes up,
or we find a tow?

838
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,815
-Fine.
-Let's just get him out
and set him up here.

839
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,492
Oh, my god,

840
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,828
-give me first.
-Oh no, please continue to text.

841
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,363
-Okay.
-Watch his penis.

842
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,468
-Or we get under.
-Do you have him?

843
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,904
- I'm under.

844
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:23,873
Okay.

845
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,876
This won't attract
any attention.

846
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:28,244
We already
got pulled over.

847
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:30,179
I think we're through
the worst of it.

848
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,514
It's not the desert,
but it'll do.

849
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,252
I think we're safe
in the middle of nowhere.

850
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:38,154
You look marvelous.

851
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:39,622
-Wait--
-Jesus, Nora,

852
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,424
it looks like a 500 pound
computer programmer

853
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,359
lives in your trunk.

854
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,595
The last accent piece.

855
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,068
"I'm ready for my close-up,
Mr. demille."

856
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,302
Lovely,
he looks like he can hit

857
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:54,337
"the man hole"
when we're finished.

858
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:56,172
I do what I can.

859
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,271
Guess I don't have
to go to the gym
for the next week.

860
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:30,006
Yeah, well, but
you're not toning
your arms.

861
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:31,908
What is it with you guys
and the arm jokes and me?

862
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,044
-Oh, come on.
-I want an apology.

863
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:37,446
-Oh, he's bucking.
-Oh, oh, hey, whoa.

864
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:42,018
What the fuck?

865
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,386
And he's out.

866
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:44,453
I thought I was
the clumsy one.

867
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,189
Don't you dare
answer that.

868
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:48,391
I don't want to.
It's probably just Ryan.

869
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:50,459
Should we just,
do it here?

870
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,663
It's not gonna get him
on the sex offenders
registry or anything.

871
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:56,265
I could settle for
humiliation and dusty nuts.

872
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,334
That'll be the title
of his autobiography.

873
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:00,336
"Dusty nuts."

874
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:03,306
I think he's out.
We could pretty much do
anything we want to him.

875
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:04,974
I say we brand him.

876
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:06,275
Do you happen
to have a branding iron

877
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,944
in your trunk,
as well?

878
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,512
I'm not above etching,
"rapist" on his stomach.

879
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:11,080
No, let's stick
to the plan.

880
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:13,049
I would rather
not add assault and battery

881
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:14,183
to the list,
with kidnapping.

882
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:15,384
Do you have
the scissors?

883
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:16,953
What are you
gonna do with them?

884
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,487
Cut his clothes off.

885
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,189
If we're gonna make him
hitch back naked

886
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,357
in sunglasses
and a feather boa,

887
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,592
he needs to be naked.

888
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:24,961
We're not going to
physically undress him

889
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,128
I don't need to reminisce.

890
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,531
I'm just gonna cut
his clothes off.

891
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,299
Well, I forgot them.

892
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:34,170
Okay, just sit him up, and
i will take his clothes off.

893
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:40,476
- Oh, god.
-What, what?

894
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,711
Oh, just--
come here.

895
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:44,046
Oh, god.
What now?

896
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,185
I don't think we're
gonna have to worry

897
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:51,053
about humiliating
him anymore.

898
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,154
God.

899
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,023
Okay, this can't
be happening.

900
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,725
-Is he breathing?
-Yeah.

901
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,460
Maybe through the giant hole
in the center of his face.

902
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:00,229
So, he's dead?
Like, dead, dead?

903
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:01,564
What other kind is there?

904
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:03,199
Dead is a pretty
definitive word to use.

905
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:05,668
See, this is why
i don't online date.

906
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,404
- It's too much work.

907
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:09,672
God, can Ryan
take a hint?

908
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,607
Psychotic, much?

909
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,509
Okay, we are standing
over the dead body of
your last date,

910
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,311
so you should probably
not start with me.

911
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,645
So, we're not worried that
he's a tad possessive?

912
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,514
He gets worried about me.

913
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,516
Yeah, I bet
he's real concerned
about your welfare.

914
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,385
You don't know how he is.

915
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:23,686
All the good
stuff he does.

916
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,755
Right, we don't,
so tell us.

917
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,523
He's been supporting me
since I lost my job.

918
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,291
You lost your job?

919
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:30,760
Okay, we have more pressing
issues than my love life,

920
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:32,228
and employment status.

921
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,796
I don't think
he's going anywhere.

922
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:36,665
We are corpse adjacent.
Dead jokes are not funny.

923
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,035
Okay, please,
i would love for you
to keep yelling

924
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:40,436
so the cops
can find us again.

925
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:43,639
- No!
-Ew! This can't be happening.

926
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:47,710
Nora?
Are you cracking?

927
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,145
Is this you cracking?

928
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:50,613
If I did, would you
kill me, too?

929
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:53,349
-No.
-Okay, what is going on?

930
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:54,617
My shoes.

931
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:57,787
There's blood
on my shoes, gross.

932
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,422
Then stop
touching everything.

933
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:00,523
It is everywhere.

934
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:02,525
Okay--
we're gonna be fine.

935
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,226
Everything
is going to be okay.

936
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,327
I have to go.

937
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:06,429
I have to get
my shoe cleaner.

938
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,332
Ridiculous.

939
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:12,468
Get his I.D.

940
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:15,304
I'm sorry
I'm not fucking sorry.

we were briefly
speechless.

948
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,664
I didn't care
that he was dead.

949
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:44,867

We'll say
it was a mafia hit.

954
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,377
No, like seriously.

955
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:58,514
He's random guy without
i.D. In the middle of nowhere.

956
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:00,282
By the time the animals
are done with him,

957
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,618
he'll only be recognizable
through dental records.

958
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,753
Too bad we couldn't
have taken Adam out
at the same time.

959
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,623
-What?
-No, it's just--

960
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,258
I feel like whenever
we start talking about him,

961
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,526
is when he shows up.

962
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:12,361
Its like he has
a radar for it,

963
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,630
and we definitely do not
need him showing up tonight.

964
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,233
Amen to that.

965
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,269
Do you ever miss him?

966
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:23,906
How could I miss him?
He's always lurking around.

967
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:43,425
-I'll go grab my stuff.
-Okay.

968
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,394
I'll be really quick.

969
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,935
I need a shoe cleaner, stat!

970
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,410
Oh, where are you at?

971
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,947
Eureka!

972
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,916
I have found it.

973
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,322
Please,
please, please.

974
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:16,292
If there is a god.

975
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:18,427
-What are you doing?
-Oh, fuck!

976
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:21,597
Uh, I stained my shoes.

977
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,399
How'd you do that?

978
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:25,568
Some cow in leopard print
spilled a vodka cran on them.

979
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,937
Hag.

980
00:53:27,939 --> 00:53:32,841
-What?
-You're so good at lying,
it scares me.

981
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,944
What are you talking about?

982
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:37,813
- I know where
you were tonight.

983
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:39,982
I know what you did.

984
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:41,250
What I did?

985
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,318
What about
what she did?

986
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,686
I mean, hit your mouth,
sister.

987
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:45,721
Exhibit a.

988
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,263
Looks like you had
a bloody good time, mate.

989
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,836
She should just
give it up.

990
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:03,706
Blood doesn't
come out of anything.

991
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:06,675
This one time,

992
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:10,246
Adam fell and cut
himself in the kitchen,

993
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,348
I mean, it was after
he punched me,

994
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,716
so part of me
just wanted

995
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:15,551
to let him bleed out
all over the place,

996
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:17,553
like a stuck pig.

997
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:20,022
But I didn't.

998
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:22,625
Anyway, in the process,
he bled all over everything,

999
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:25,794
he even stained
the kitchen counter.

1000
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:28,731
I could never
get it out.

1001
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,001
God, that was
the sweetest bedtime story.

1002
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:33,802
--Please, tell it again.

1003
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:37,873
I have so many
stories like that.

1004
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,544
Why didn't
you ever tell me?

1005
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,980
It's not something
you talk about.

1006
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,684
Not even to your friends?

1007
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:51,420
Especially not
to your friends.

1008
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,524
I think you're overreacting
just a little.

1009
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:56,625
I know I didn't
answer my phone,

1010
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,328
no, that's the thing--
you did.

1011
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,030
Now I'm confused.
Have you been drinking?

1012
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,465
-I heard the whole thing.
-You heard what?

1013
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,967
What are you even
talking about?

1014
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,935
Okay, you want to know
what i-- look.

1015
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,306
You butt-answered.

1016
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:11,540
Now do you want
to talk about it?

1017
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:12,941
I actually don't.
I have to go,

1018
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,510
and I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1019
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:16,945
You've really been drinking
and you are paranoid.

1020
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:18,781
No. Look, you're
not going anywhere.

1021
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,083
Like hell I'm not.

1022
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:22,618
I think I'm gonna
go check on her.

1023
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,853
-Tell her to hurry up.
-You're coming with me.

1024
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,322
We're just
gonna find her

1025
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,923
psychotically
scrubbing her shoes.

1026
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,426
At the very least,
we'll hurry her up.

1027
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:32,995
If we can pry them
out of her hands.

1028
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:44,773
Shh.

1029
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,709
Someone needs
to have a garage sale.

1030
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:48,477
Yeah.

1031
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,747
Shh, shh.

1032
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:53,415
You're acting like a child.

1033
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,817
Good, then you won't
mind if I leave.

1034
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:56,452
What-- so, where are
you gonna go, then?

1035
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:57,886
Oh, because being here
is such a delight,

1036
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,421
why wouldn't
i want to stay?

1037
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:01,423
-So, why have you stayed?
-You're such an ass.

1038
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:02,925
No, answer
the fucking question!

1039
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:04,660
Because I love you!

1040
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,464
Wait, then,
why are you leaving me?

1041
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:09,898
Clearly, this is over.

1042
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,567
Okay, but, if you
just talk to me--

1043
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:15,104
okay, that's the point--
i can't talk to you anymore.

1044
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:17,039
So what, are you gonna
leave with the girls?
That's fucking rich.

1045
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,841
You don't accept me.
They do.

1046
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,477
I'm still the same person.
You're the one who's changed.

1047
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:23,545
That's because
the circumstances
have changed, okay?

1048
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,115
-No, you have to adapt.
-No, actually, I don't.

1049
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:28,450
-They don't need me to change.
-Nora, listen to yourself.

1050
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:29,852
You're being
fucking ridiculous.

1051
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,854
-I'm leaving.
-No, no, you're not.

1052
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:33,989
Okay, look,
if you walk out,

1053
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:36,625
I will ruin all of you.

1054
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,961
Oh f--
oh, god,

1055
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:41,029
oh, that's great.
Yeah, welcome. Yeah.

1056
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:43,065
Nora, we have to go.

1057
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,501
Yeah, no you're not.
No one's going anywhere.

1058
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:46,668
Give her back her bag.

1059
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,570
No, it's my bag.
I paid for it.

1060
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,005
-It was a gift.
-Well, I'm taking
it back, anyway.

1061
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,640
Ugh! Let go!

1062
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:53,175
Over my dead body.

1063
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,482
All right, then.

1064
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:02,785
Ryan?

1065
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,922
Oh, my god.

1066
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,628
You know, I hope you're
intending on replacing that.

1067
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,997
Ryan, you have--

1068
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:17,766
what the fuck?

1069
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,971
No.

1070
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,182
So, this is bad.

1071
00:57:33,184 --> 00:57:36,952
-What do we do?
-Nothing.

1072
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,154
His mother comes
to clean tomorrow.

1073
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,156
His mother cleans
your house?

1074
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:45,027
-What do you do?
-Apparently, not enough.

1075
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,097
Uh, my bag.

1076
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,084
You drive.

1077
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,264
It dawned on me--

1078
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:25,167
maybe we were better off
without men in our lives.

1079
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:28,804
I knew Nora would be
happier without Ryan.

1080
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,723
You okay up there?

1081
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,097
-Do you think
she's gonna be okay?
-Probably.

1082
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,766
You guys can stop talking
about me like I'm not here.

1083
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:59,868
You could start responding
like you are here.

1084
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,273
Jesus,
spit it out, Nora!

1085
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:06,642
Typical Ryan.

1086
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:09,211
He never
fucking listened.

1087
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,913
I'm just bummed.

1088
00:59:10,915 --> 00:59:12,281
"Bummed" is really the word
you're gonna go with?

1089
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,285
I know it's stupid.

1090
00:59:16,287 --> 00:59:18,720
It's not stupid at all.

1091
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:24,560
I just really loved
those shoes.

1092
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:26,161
Now I'm gonna be
homeless and single,

1093
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:28,664
and have bad footwear.

1094
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:02,331
-What the fuck?
-My parents are going
to be so pissed.

1095
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:04,733
Are you gonna
call the cops?

1096
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,604
And where am I gonna tell
them I was while my place
was being trashed?

1097
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:19,348
I can think of an easy
solution to that problem.

1098
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,249
Easy being a relative term,

1099
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,085
but it's probably
more convenient than
redecorating

1100
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:24,987
every time your ex
throws a hissy fit.

1101
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:26,888
I'm listening.

1102
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,324
If you think about it,
he's really kind of
a loose end.

1103
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,193
Lurking about,
and whatnot.

1104
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,731
What the fuck
is happening here?

1105
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,734
We're gonna kill Adam.

1106
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,771
She's kidding.

1107
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,043
No, she wasn't.

1108
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,050
Well...

1109
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:56,918
We said we'd be all in
in the beginning of the night,

1110
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,755
so, I'm in.

1111
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:01,923
Yes.

1112
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:03,692
But seriously,
can we please get food first?

1113
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:06,795
Homicide
makes me hungry.

1114
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,233
Protecting Olivia
just made sense.

1115
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:16,872
I smell bacon.

1116
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,344
I would literally
stab someone

1117
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,812
for pancakes
right now.

1118
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:25,814
Does tonight work
for everybody?

1119
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,749
Oh god, everyone
is just a little too
overstimulated right now.

1120
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:29,151
You'd think
i would be the one

1121
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:30,986
who would be
the most excited
about this.

1122
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:33,422
I'm a passionate person.
I'm committed to the cause.

1123
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:36,992
- I'll say.

1124
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:42,097
Hello? Yes.

1125
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,132
Something
happened to Ryan?

1126
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:50,972
Okay. I'll be
right there.

1127
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,910
Something happened
to Ryan.

1128
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:56,812
Shocker.

1129
01:01:56,814 --> 01:02:00,048
I just want bacon to go.

1130
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,085
Okay, do you have
your story straight?

1131
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:04,453
Yeah. I was with
you guys all night.

1132
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:05,954
And doing what?

1133
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:07,222
- Watching a movie.
- -What movie?

1134
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,790
-What do you got?
-"Clueless."

1135
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,292
- Watching "clueless."
-What else?

1136
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:11,493
Jesus fucking Christ,
we're watching, "clueless,"

1137
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:12,861
eating stir fry
and chocolate ice cream

1138
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:14,196
and braiding
each other's hair.

1139
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:15,731
And laughing at guys
on tinder all night.

1140
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,799
-Better?
-Much.

1141
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:19,034
We can't have
any holes in our story,

1142
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:20,335
or loose ends.

1143
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,105
Sad, sad. Be sad.

1144
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:25,440
Wait-- the shoes.

1145
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:28,143
-Think about the shoes.
-See you tonight.

1146
01:02:28,145 --> 01:02:30,278
Yeah we should probably
share a car ride, nose goes.

1147
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,780
Oh!

1148
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:32,781
Oh come on, not it!

1149
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:34,382
I drove last time.

1150
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:37,319
Are we seriously organizing
a murder carpool right now?

1151
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:41,490

we should have carpooled.

01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,874
What? I had to shower
after my interrogation.

1179
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:41,443
Wouldn't it have made
more sense for you
to shower after this?

1180
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:43,011
Right.
Make me the errand bitch

1181

and then criticize me

1182
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:47,015

All right,
mood lighting it is.

1189
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,501
I prefer the cover
of darkness, anyways.

Oh, Liv...

1204
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:27,742
This is so romantic.

1205
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:30,078
Surprised?

1206
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,817
-Come to apologize?
-For what?

1207
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:38,553
You were the one who
trashed my parents house.

1208
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,688
You served me
with divorce papers.

1209
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,424
So?

1210
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:44,492
It hurt my feelings.

1211
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:46,728
I'm not seeing
the correlation.

1212
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:50,832
Oh--

1213
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:54,402
oh, baby,
you look tired.

1214
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:59,340
Did you have
too much to drink?

1215
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:04,112
Well, it wouldn't
be the first time.

1216
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:08,183
Here. Shh.

1217
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:16,724
I want you to know,
that what's about
to happen to you,

1218
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:20,195
is all your fault.

1219
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,567
"Dear Olivia..."

1220
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:29,471
Words cannot begin
to express the depths

1221
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:30,572
of my sorrow..."

1222
01:08:30,574 --> 01:08:32,207
I didn't write that.

1223
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:34,442
You know,
it is so rude
to interrupt.

1224
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:37,612
Especially when
I'm reading your
last words.

1225
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:43,685
If you're not gonna pay
attention, then why bother?

1226
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:47,856
No more reading
before bedtime for you.

1227
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:51,593
Bummer. Spoiler alert--
it was kind of poetic.

1228
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:52,827
Quite frankly,
i think it makes you sound

1229
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:55,296
more intelligent
than you are.

1230
01:08:55,298 --> 01:09:00,135
-Why?
-Because black widows
eat their mates.

1231
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:05,240
Since I know
you like it rough, babe.

1232
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,353
--Is that a text message?

1233
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:55,590
Uh, yeah,
the cop.

1234
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:57,258
Is he asking you out?

1235
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,460
Let's hope not
for his sake.

1236
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:02,363
"How about dinner
tomorrow night?"

1237
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,965
Here's
to new beginnings.

1238
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:06,334
Oh my god,
i have a great idea
for my new job.

1239
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:07,735
I could do
crime scene clean-up.

1240
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:09,370
You could pimp me out
to your new boyfriend.

1241
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,272
I-- I'm not gonna be
pimping you out to anyone.

1242
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:12,941
I'm pretty sure
you're better at
creating the mess,

1243
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:15,610
than you are at
cleaning it up.

1244
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,430
Oh, you can't get
it in your mouth?

1245
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:36,898
I'm careful
when it counts.

1246
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
But feeding
doesn't qualify?

1247
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,501
- I blame you.
- -Mm-hmm.

1248
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:41,936
You're just
so intimidating.

1249
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,605
I'm eating with
a man of the law.

1250
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:45,640
-I understand.
-We'll be having desserts

1251
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:46,941
-in a moment.
-Oh thank you.

1252
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:48,910
You're welcome.

1253
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:54,282
Look, I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

1254
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:57,385
Did you know the guy
in the back of your car

1255
01:10:57,387 --> 01:10:58,620
the night
i pulled you over?

1256
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:01,356
-The guy in the back
of the car...
-Yeah.

1257
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:03,024
Not really.

1258
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:05,460
Nora always makes
the strangest friends
at the bar.

1259
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:08,463
Doesn't Nora
have a boyfriend?

1260
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:10,431
She was in the station
yesterday about him.

1261
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,638
Will you excuse me?
I just have to...

1262
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,773
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to
jump into work,

1263
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,575
-i just--
-no, it's-- it's fine.

1264
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,343
I'll be right back.

1265
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,583
-Excuse me.
-Can I help you
with something?

1266
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:30,985
Is there any way
that I could change my order?

1267
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:32,954
Women can be so fickle.

1268
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:39,861
Thank you.

1269
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:42,797
Chivalry isn't dead.

1270
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,833
-I hope not.
-For you, miss.
And for you, sir.

1271
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,935
-Thank you, sir.
-Please enjoy.

1272
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,446
Mmm.

1273
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,650
Would you like to
try some of mine?

1274
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,485
Wow, a man who's willing
to share his dessert.

1275
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:08,656
That is an
admirable quality.

1276
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:11,859
Mmm.

1277
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:16,998
That tastes like heaven.

1278
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,701
Would you like to get
a drink after this?

1279
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:21,336
See, you already
want to spend

1280
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:23,037
the rest of your life
with me.

1281
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:27,342
I don't know if I could handle
the sarcasm for that long.

1282
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:31,946
Now this...
Is to die for.

1283
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:34,015
You gonna let me
try some of it?

1284
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:36,984
You know, I don't know
if I can even part with
a bite of this.

1285
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:39,887
- Hmm.
-It's very difficult for me.

1286
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:42,757
Fine. Open wide.

1287
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,895
I'm kinda nuts
about you.

1288
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,616
Nutty nutters,
taste like peanut butters.

1289
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:11,386
I really can't.
I'm allergic.

1290
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,671
