1
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,794
- Miss Oates!

2
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,006
Anybody home?

3
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,965
It's me Ms. Oates, Jersey Callum,

4
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,096
Homicide Division, remember?

5
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,011
- Lieutenant, something's not right here.

6
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,683
- Yeah Mullin, you're not right here.

7
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,467
Mullin?

8
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,227
Alley?

9
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:21,901
- Shit, Jersey, don't you cops ever knock?

10
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:23,826
- We do.

11
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,995
- I knocked, I yelled, you didn't answer.

12
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:27,823
- I was sleepin'.

13
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,002
People do that in the
privacy of their own homes.

14
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,215
- You getting' up or
you just goin' to bed?

15
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,585
- I don't have to take this crap.

16
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:42,879
- [Jersey] Alley.

17
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,431
- You bastard.

18
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,886
- Alley, I tried to find
you up at the school.

19
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,805
- You're trespassing Callum.

20
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,732
- The Dean of the English Department

21
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,025
said you quit weeks ago.

22
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,527
- Just get out.

23
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,948
- What the hell is this, huh?

24
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,901
What happened to you?

25
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,493
- Just leave please.

26
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,508
- All right Mullin, pack it
up, huh, we're outta here.

27
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,384
- What about, uh, what about the witch?

28
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,180
- You know you're really
somethin', I mean that.

29
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,603
You're bettin' a thousand, you know that?

30
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:36,479
Go on, go.

31
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,612
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

32
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,282
it's kinda hard to get good
help these day, ya know?

33
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:55,210
It's funny, ya know 'cause
that's one of the reasons I came,

34
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,411
ya know, you can help.

35
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,958
Ya know, I saw the files
and things you burned

36
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:02,884
out there in the fireplace,

37
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,678
and thank you I noticed my
card happened to be one of 'em.

38
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,638
So anyway, I'm gonna leave
you another card just in case.

39
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,803
- In case?

40
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,518
In case what?

41
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,774
I get the urge to help you
dig up baby bones again?

42
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,817
Like some dog you got on a leash?

43
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:35,792
- Alley, last week we dug
up the bodies of three kids.

44
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,834
- I can't help you.

45
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,960
- It seems a mortician
had kept them locked up

46
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,666
in a storage room for some time.

47
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,589
He kept them alive by feedin' 'em--

48
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,296
- [Alley] Damn it, I don't care!

49
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,050
- By feedin' 'em parts
of his other clientele.

50
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,555
- Clientele?

51
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,769
You mean ca, cadavers?

52
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,480
- The coroner found human
remains in their stomachs.

53
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,400
- Ah Jesus.

54
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,700
- The mortician turned himself in,

55
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,328
he said he had some ghouls locked away

56
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,581
in a storeroom at his place.

57
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,037
- God, enough!

58
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,045
Just shut up, will you?

59
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,891
I don't want this crap in my life anymore.

60
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,393
It hurt too much.

61
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,236
Every time I'd be
helping you on some case,

62
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,245
I'd be praying we wouldn't
find 'em, but we would.

63
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,828
Just what the hell

64
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,164
am I supposed to do
with the grief, Jersey?

65
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,256
What do you do with it?

66
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,089
- All right, you listen
to me forjust a minute,

67
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:12,923
I'ma tell you somethin'.

68
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:13,757
A lot of people don't believe in

69
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,717
this so-called gift that you've got.

70
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,347
A lot of the people don't believe in what,

71
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,431
what do you call it, psychometry, eh?

72
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,264
And I'll tell you the truth,

73
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,439
I don't know if I believe it or not,

74
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,190
I, I have seen your work
and I've seen the results.

75
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,239
Listen, on this case,
we don't have anything,

76
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,236
we don't know who these kids are,

77
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,067
we don't know where they live,

78
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,824
we don't know who their
parents are, ya know?

79
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:35,904
I don't have a clue.

80
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,579
I'm supposed to tap every resource I have

81
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,329
<i>and that's why I'm comm' to you.</i>

82
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,339
All right I know you had it kinda rough

83
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,965
on those last cases and
so did a lot of people.

84
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,217
Well you go on you,

85
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,766
go on, live in this bizarre
kinda tomb you made for yourself

86
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,639
or you can come out there and
join the livin' and maybe,

87
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,891
just maybe between the two of us we can

88
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,145
I don't know maybe we can
help these kids move on.

89
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,569
You know, at least promise
you'll think about it.

90
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,202
Alley, promise.

91
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,622
- Oh.

92
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,897
- [Interviewer] And you believe
this to be true, this curse?

93
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:41,482
Mr.Chen, you're not
helping us here, Mr. Chen.

94
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:48,201
- I have told you what is true,
all at great risk to myself.

95
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,786
- [Interviewer] These
are very serious charges

96
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,160
that are pending against you
Mr. Chen, now you're attorney--

97
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,866
- He won't be needed.

98
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,459
- [Interviewer] Why is that?

99
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,082
- Because he can't hep me.

100
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,831
- [Interviewer] You called us for help.

101
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,086
Why, Why'd you do that?

102
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,966
- I did what I did because I was afraid,

103
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,508
they are becoming restless,

104
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:16,597
harder to manage, the
cycle must be stopped,

105
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,189
you must stop them!

106
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,987
- [Interviewer] Just who are
they, come on one more time.

107
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:30,076
- They are my masters, just as they were

108
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:34,497
my father's before me and
his father before him.

109
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,699
- [Interviewer] So you and your ancestors

110
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,124
have been retainers then?

111
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,380
- Yes, three, three centuries,

112
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,209
it is penance generations of my family

113
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,044
have learned to live with.

114
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,171
- [Interviewer] A penance?

115
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,141
- [Chen] For mistakes
my ancestors have made.

116
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,596
- Pay attention,, huh, maybe
you'll learn somethin'.

117
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,182
- They involved themselves

118
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,564
with things they did not understand.

119
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:05,986
- [Interviewer] The occult?

120
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,574
Okay, question, if these, if these things

121
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,948
are are so feared, so powerful,

122
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,534
why do they require mere
mortals to protect them?

123
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:22,920
- They do not, it has been
my family's responsibility,

124
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:28,968
curse to see that mankind
is protected from them.

125
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,340
You see if they are not
fed, they will feed.

126
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,391
- [Interviewer] But the bodies they found

127
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,014
were dead, Mr. Chen.

128
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,142
They, they weren't any threat to anybody.

129
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:46,694
- They are kyoshi, the
undead, when they are full

130
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:53,326
they can play 'possum very
well, very well indeed.

131
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,497
- You wanna see it again?

132
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,540
- No.

133
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,965
- Well, what do ya think?

134
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,386
- I don't know.

135
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,974
Somethin', somethin' feels
different about this one.

136
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,728
What else have you got?

137
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,611
- Looks like Mr. Chen here
is the last of a long line.

138
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,158
He was the only son,
he's never been married

139
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,450
and there's no children.

140
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,327
He inherited this mortuary
business from his late father.

141
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,326
- Who had it before his father?

142
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,787
- According to what we found,

143
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,841
he's from a long lie of morticians, why?

144
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,636
- Fresh meat?

145
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,054
He'd have an endless supply
of protein, wouldn't he?

146
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,181
Organs, limbs?

147
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,611
Now, he couldn't touch the bodies

148
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,735
that he had to put out for viewing.

149
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,111
- No, no.

150
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,072
- Not above the waist anyway,

151
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,282
but he could strip their backs.

152
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,538
- Oh yeah, well.

153
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,040
Are you serious?

154
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,345
- Well, Mr. Chen certainly is.

155
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,392
Oh I don't know, I mean,

156
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,226
maybe he took those three kids, ya know,

157
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,311
invented the ghouls to create
his own reality, I don't know.

158
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,491
- Just wasted three live, huh?

159
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:00,573
- You mean four.

160
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,663
- Oh, listen, lam,

161
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,089
uh, I'm sorry about uh you
know what I said over there,

162
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,632
the kitchen and all and the talk about you

163
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,925
building the tomb for yourself

164
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,672
and all, and I just ya know.

165
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,845
- I was talking about Mr. Chen.

166
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,764
- I'm sorry, I thought you meant uh.

167
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,816
- Forget it, doesn't matter.

168
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,656
All right, but I'm tellin' you,

169
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,833
any publicity this time and I'm walkin'.

170
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,659
- No problem.

171
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,915
- No, Jersey I mean it,

172
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,837
you keep my name out of it this time.

173
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,004
- Look, need to know basis.

174
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,879
- I don't want people lookin' me up after,

175
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,461
not even you, especially you.

176
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,345
Well.

177
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,936
Let's go see the bodies.

178
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,110
(suspenseful music))

179
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,291
Hoped I'd never see this place again.

180
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,966
- Yeah well you almost didn't,

181
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,010
this building's gonna be torn down.

182
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,803
The County Coroner is consolidating

183
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,006
new headquarters over in Jefferson,

184
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,427
all these satellite building's
gonna be demolished.

185
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,354
In two months, this place'll
probably be the first one.

186
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:52,810
- Good.

187
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,890
- Alley, sign in would ya?

188
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,395
- Floofsoms!

189
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,606
Bad!

190
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,106
Bad dog!

191
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:47,161
Doesn't baby waby recognize
Lieutenant Jersey, see?

192
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,364
- Just give us the tags
will ya, Miss Poopinplatz?

193
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,539
- Are you authorized?

194
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,088
Okay, what about her?

195
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,384
- She is with me.

196
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,962
- Oh, driver's license?

197
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,141
Hm, porked out, didn't we?

198
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,941
- Hey come on, will you, we
don't have all night here.

199
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:26,196
- Oh cool yourjets Jersey,
fetch Floofsoms, fetch!

200
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,164
None of our patients are going anywhere.

201
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,085
Okay, come on you two.

202
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,751
- What, are you serious?

203
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,550
- Look, I've got procedures
to follow, no exceptions.

204
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,021
Now, you got an admissions form?

205
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,520
Sorry babe, not allowed in the boneyard.

206
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,522
- Pardon?

207
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,199
- It's a morgue, it's
kind of a, a new nickname.

208
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,195
- And well, it beats the stink hole.

209
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,575
- Oh boy, last year, we had one

210
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,374
over ripe customer in here, a floater.

211
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,996
When they cut into him downstairs,

212
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,750
the pus was oozin' all over the place.

213
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,877
We couldn't get the stink out, it was--

214
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,710
- Heyjust uh, line us up
for a viewing room huh?

215
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:35,269
- Okay, gift wrap two John
Does, four oh 12, four oh 13,

216
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:42,026
chain four oh 14, got a
peepshow party of three, over.

217
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,446
You've heard the spiel.

218
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:47,489
- A couple a times.

219
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,782
- Okay, hear it again.

220
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,992
Now my rules are very simple,

221
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,948
keep quiet, keep outta trouble,

222
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,534
keep outta my hair,
there's so little of it.

223
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,466
Now equipment's delicate,
not what it used to be.

224
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,722
You break it you bought it.

225
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,896
And I'll be checkin' it out
before your IDs are returned.

226
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:20,851
Okay?

227
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,734
Party hardy.

228
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:27,904
- Who the hell was that woman?

229
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,322
I don't remember seeing her before.

230
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,945
- Well, you never been
here at night before,

231
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,994
she has been on the graveyard
shift since year one.

232
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,447
Nobody has the guts to
fire her, that's all.

233
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,702
- Nah, the only way they
could get rid of her

234
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,704
is if they burned her at the stake.

235
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,126
- Uh, Shep you been here,

236
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,048
I mean don't you have a home to go to?

237
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,468
- No, dragon lady won't let me.

238
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,386
You know what I think,

239
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,306
I think she's fattening us all
up for Thanksgiving dinner.

240
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,223
- Oh sure, sure.

241
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,478
Listen I have a guest
here with me, Miss Oates.

242
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,727
- [Willie] Alley Oates?

243
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,648
- Yeah.

244
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,983
- [Willie] Shepard here, Willie Shepard,

245
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,195
the Harris case, you remember?

246
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,870
- Oh yeah, sure, you lD'd
those bone fragments I found.

247
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,415
- That's right, that
right, so how ya been?

248
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,202
You know I haven't seen you for so long,

249
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,128
I thought maybe you gave all this up.

250
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,209
- I did.

251
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,800
- [Willie] So, well, what,

252
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,673
<i>are you comm' outta refinement now'?</i>

253
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,675
- Oh sorta.

254
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,259
- [Willie] Hey, hey, all right.

255
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,516
- Uh Shep, I wanna show her
the three kids there, huh?

256
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,768
- Haven't you see these
three stiff enough?

257
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:46,687
- Yes I have.

258
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,025
- You know what I think I oughta do,

259
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,402
I think I oughta wrap 'em all up

260
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,779
and then you can take 'em home with you.

261
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,361
- What are we doin' jokes
now about dead children?

262
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,877
Well, what do ya think, huh?

263
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,171
- [Alley] Don't ask.

264
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,465
Any clothing, personal effects?

265
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,597
- Ah, wait wait, just this,
just this one thing here.

266
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,138
- A doll, nothing else?

267
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,266
- [Willie] Nothing else, this is it.

268
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,818
- And I still can't go
down and touch the bodies?

269
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,647
- No way, no you'd be
contaminating the evidence.

270
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,233
The judge would throw the
case right outta court.

271
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,158
- Shit.

272
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:45,584
Hey Shep, think anybody'd
miss a lock of hair, huh?

273
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,713
- That's the little Oriental boy.

274
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,638
' [Alley] Yeah.

275
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,308
- Is that enough?

276
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,649
- It'll do.

277
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,193
- [Willie] I'll send it right up to you.

278
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,070
- Thanks Shep.

279
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,618
- [Willie] Listen ah, let me know

280
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,078
how this comes out, would you?

281
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:29,957
- Yeah, yeah sure.

282
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,585
- I gotta go, peace and joy.

283
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:39,847
- Yeah, yeah, peace ad joy.

284
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:43,887
Here you are.

285
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,068
- I'll need a quiet room.

286
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,646
- Well, there's the old lounge
still right down the hall.

287
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,610
- The lounge.

288
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,082
- We're gonna stay out here in the hall,

289
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,535
so you will not be bothered.

290
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,541
Yeah Alley.

291
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:16,920
Hey thanks.

292
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,431
No, no, um, really.

293
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,688
- Well, I haven't done anything yet.

294
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,439
- Think she can really help us?

295
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,322
- Ah, you kidding, she's
already led me to a lotta clues.

296
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,324
- But she's never solved
any cases on her own.

297
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,575
- Well, Alley doesn't work that way.

298
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:46,780
From what I understand,

299
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,865
she she gets these impressions, you see,

300
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,294
and at first they're kind
of what, disjointed huh,

301
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,872
but then later on in the case
they start to make sense.

302
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,378
What, what do they say
hindsight is what, 20/20.

303
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,471
- Maybe she's uh, a little, uh, myopic.

304
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,392
Well so what, she takes an object,

305
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,639
something that belonged to the person

306
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,766
who's missing or deceased and--

307
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,392
- Exactly.

308
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,222
- And what?

309
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,183
- Well she, hey you want one of these?

310
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,859
- Nah, thanks.

311
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,482
- Uh see, a lotta times these objects

312
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,189
don't give her a feeling or anything

313
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,616
but other times, phew
she's right on the money.

314
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,903
- She have this all her life?

315
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:26,737
- Hey come on, you make it

316
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,162
sound like a disease or something.

317
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,995
No, no the story goes as I understand it,

318
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:31,825
about eight years ago,

319
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,910
she started going with
this Canadian guy, see?

320
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,079
And they lived together for a while

321
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,666
and Alley became pregnant.

322
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,924
Swell guy that he was, when
see told him, he split.

323
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,806
Well anyway, Alley decided that
she was gonna have the baby.

324
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:53,431
But she uh, she lost it,
there was ovarian cancer.

325
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,733
- Oh wow, that's really rough.

326
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,939
- After the diagnosis, she
went to a radiation treatment.

327
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,570
Two years that she fought like hell

328
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,744
and she won, not a trace, nothing.

329
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,786
Anyway, she started
getting these nightmares,

330
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,243
dreams that were a little too real.

331
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,794
She started following up on 'em

332
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:20,295
and seems like some of 'em
had some validity to 'em.

333
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,876
- So how did you meet up with her?

334
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,595
- She called me right outta the blue,

335
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,842
you know, I mean, I picked up the phone,

336
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,173
I thought for a minute
I had a nut on the line.

337
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,724
She said, so I got some information

338
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,177
on a case you're workin' on.

339
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,475
Well you know, I didn't
believe her at first,

340
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,022
but then latter on, hmm, hmm.

341
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:42,105
- Jesus Jersey, I mean you
really believe in her, don't you?

342
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:48,991
- Huh, hey, what, where are
those keys of yours, huh?

343
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,203
Here, look at this,

344
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,584
everybody gotta believe in somethin', huh?

345
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,169
Hey!

346
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,455
- [Poopinplatz] Turn it around, Marty,

347
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,166
deliveries downstairs!

348
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,093
- [Marty] I'm tryin' to
tell you there's no access!

349
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,716
- [Poopinplatz] This is a
lobby not Grand Central!

350
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,094
- Whoa, come on, what's
the trouble here, huh?

351
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,424
- Pneumatic line's ruptured

352
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,352
on the doors downstairs, they won't open.

353
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,978
Lilly Munster here, won't let
me through to the elevator.

354
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,400
- Regulations require direct delivery

355
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,022
through sub-level three!

356
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,571
- The doors are closed, Poopinplatz,

357
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,613
what do you want me to do,

358
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,942
leave the bodies to
stink up the parking lot?

359
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,626
- Hey whoa, whoa, settle
down, huh, settle down.

360
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,885
Where's the chief administrator?

361
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:47,802
- He's in bed.

362
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,177
- Well, who runs this place at night?

363
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,808
- Come on, what's to
run, there's me up here,

364
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,108
five coroners downstairs
with a room full of stiffs,

365
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,060
everybody's been laid
off or transferred over

366
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,896
to that shiny new
monstrosity in Jefferson.

367
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,027
- Terrific.

368
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,654
- Huh, we're only good for the overflow,

369
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,955
look, 22 years of community
service and what do we get,

370
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,658
the high and the mighty scrap
off the bottoms of their shoes

371
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,790
and hand us flattened human stool.

372
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,669
Uh, oh, ha, we get the
leftovers, like this.

373
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,669
Look at that!

374
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,047
- Give me break, I'm just a delivery boy.

375
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,763
- Is there any other way
in or out of the sub-level,

376
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,806
besides delivery or the elevators?

377
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,760
- If there was, do you think
I'd be tangling with her?

378
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,853
- Huh, good point.

379
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:39,771
- Very good.

380
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,016
We can work this out though.

381
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,601
Miss Poopinplatz get someone over here

382
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,187
to fix the doors down on
sub-level three, all right?

383
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,237
- It's late.

384
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,485
- Well, try.

385
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,115
In the meanwhile, we're
gonna use this lobby

386
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:58,665
as the emergency delivery
area, you got it, got it?

387
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,495
Would you mind answering the telephone?

388
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,584
All right, Marty come on.

389
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,052
- Jersey!

390
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,223
- Help him out.

391
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,801
Thanks, Jersey Callum.

392
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,272
Well great!

393
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,496
<i>_</i> Boo!

394
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,288
Watch out, sometimes they bite.

395
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:54,092
- Um, so uh, how did he uh?

396
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,343
- She man, it's a she.

397
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,721
If we knew that, she wouldn't be here.

398
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:05,016
Personally, it looks like a suicide,

399
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,725
you know just add water,

400
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,902
poof, electrocution.

401
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,450
What a waste, quite a cute one, wanna see?

402
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,664
- Chen's dead, yeah they
were takin' him over

403
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,586
to a psychiatric ward,

404
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,335
he broke loose from 'em,
took a service revolver and--

405
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,550
- You guys wanna give me a hand here?

406
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,721
- Well it looks like you have
another run to make, Marty.

407
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,139
- Who'd wanna kill themselves,
who'd wanna end up here?

408
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,932
Still some nutty people out there.

409
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:40,804
- Yeah.

410
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,844
Hey, whoa, whoa!

411
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,055
- [Marty] The key, get the key!

412
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:45,889
- What key?

413
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,977
- The elevator key, you
got it, come on man!

414
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,611
- [Jersey] Whoa!

415
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,034
(suspenseful music))

416
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:54,549
Whoa!

417
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,841
- What happened?

418
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,089
- [Marty] Stretcher collapsed.

419
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,716
- She is, weighs a ton.

420
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:00,717
- Dead weight.

421
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,095
- No that's funny, no you are funny.

422
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,267
- You know, you're in luck
I have room for one more.

423
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,970
- Oh well, that's a break.

424
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:10,727
- Ah.

425
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,226
Let me get the doors.

426
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,695
- [Marty] Okay.

427
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,415
- Oh Jesus!

428
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,389
Damn it!

429
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,392
Shit!

430
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,243
- [Man] All right.

431
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:59,127
- Are you sure you wanna see this?

432
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,625
- Come on man, see the world.

433
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,841
- Do you wanna stay in
here and watch this?

434
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,593
- Go ahead ad puke if you have to boy.

435
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:15,472
Let's see if you can fill this.

436
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,523
Go ahead and get the forklift, Harry.

437
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,350
This one's a wrap.

438
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:27,985
- Holy shit!

439
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,324
- Whoa, whoa!

440
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:37,911
No, no!

441
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,951
No, no!

442
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:41,873
Hey, whoa!

443
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,842
- [Alley] You don't understand,
I gotta have that key.

444
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:48,838
- Forget it, lady.

445
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,504
That's what happened.

446
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:53,718
- Damn it.

447
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:59,687
I need the elevator key,
now, they gotta be warned!

448
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:01,684
- Warned?

449
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,564
- The bodies, the bodies
we saw, they're not dead.

450
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:10,278
- We get a live one, now and then.

451
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,778
- [Alley] Please.

452
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:31,965
Damn you!

453
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,260
- Floofsoms!

454
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,184
<i>Na k
“m!</i>

455
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,616
Fetch Floofsoms, fetch,
fetch, fetch, fetch!

456
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,944
Come on, come on, let's go!

457
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,203
Bite me, bite me!

458
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,340
Fat bitch!

459
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,277
- Alley run!

460
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,203
Run, run!

461
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,037
Hey!

462
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,829
Open up in there!

463
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:58,788
- Jersey!

464
00:49:58,996 --> 00:49:59,792
- [Jersey] Come on, open the door!

465
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:00,793
- They're coming!

466
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,797
- [Jersey] Open up, hurry up!

467
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:04,627
- Shut the door!

468
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,802
- Lock it, lock it!

469
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:32,447
- Jesus Jersey, I tried to warn you.

470
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,993
I had a vision, really strong,

471
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,124
like nothin', nothin' I ever had before.

472
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,837
My God, Chen was right.

473
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,169
- You know I got a call about
an hour ago from downtown.

474
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,720
Mr. Chen killed himself.

475
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,515
- From what you told
me, I don't blame him.

476
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,811
It was a mess, we ran like crazy.

477
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,183
Those of us who could run.

478
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,772
- You know we were
lucky we heard that bell

479
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,694
from the elevator when you came down.

480
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,322
- Why didn't you take it back up?

481
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,695
- We couldn't, we were
lucky just to get here.

482
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:12,907
Oh!

483
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,201
Easy.

484
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,665
- Hey, what about her?

485
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,463
- Ah, the morgue driver, Marty

486
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:25,212
brought her in, but she was alive.

487
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,586
- Alive?

488
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,511
My God.

489
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,262
Are you okay?

490
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:44,818
Is she all right?

491
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,276
- Better than she would have been?

492
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,902
She was on the autopsy table.

493
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,153
- Damn it Shepard.

494
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,455
How the hell can something
like that happen?

495
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,746
Does anybody know who she is?

496
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:02,790
- It's Dana.

497
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,713
My name is Dana and it's not their fault.

498
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:12,679
I did it to myself.

499
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:18,514
- Why?

500
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,268
- Why live?

501
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,194
It just hurt too much.

502
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:33,863
- How's that, Dana?

503
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,792
- Jesus, we gotta get outta here.

504
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:06,979
- Dead.

505
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,405
- You gotta dial 09, everything
goes though the switchboard.

506
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,243
Oh.

507
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,160
- It's ringing.

508
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:27,080
Shep, what about that door?

509
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,756
- There is another office that
connects to the other side.

510
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,709
- Will it get us to the elevator?

511
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,919
- No, but it's closer
than we are right now.

512
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,301
- Hey, whoa, whoa, I mean, what a second.

513
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,631
Wait just one minute.

514
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,591
I mean, those things could just be

515
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,302
waiting out there, hanging around.

516
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,683
For all we know they're
right outside the door.

517
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,480
Maybe we should just stay put,

518
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,231
wait until someone shows up here.

519
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:52,313
I mean, sooner or later someone's
gonna come down here and--

520
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,489
- Get ripped to pieces.

521
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,407
- Or worse.

522
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,532
Maybe Chen didn't do such a good job

523
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,244
of keepin' that kyoshi thing locked up.

524
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:08,999
Maybe it got out.

525
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,796
Twice.

526
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,761
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

527
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,637
Are you saying that the
one created the other two?

528
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:21,558
But how?

529
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,555
- I don't know, I'm just saying

530
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,310
that I think we oughta be careful.

531
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,602
In case it's looking for new recruits.

532
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:37,070
- Hope the coroner's office
has a slow night tonight.

533
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,992
- This thing isn't working.

534
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,070
Poopinplatz must be away
from her desk, that's all.

535
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,747
- You can call later,
there're other phones.

536
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,291
Look, I'm gonna open that door.

537
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:51,038
And when I do, get ready
to shut it, just in case.

538
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,352
Shit, it's locked.

539
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,473
Give me a minute.

540
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,682
All right back off, will ya?

541
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,360
- Hey, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

542
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,402
You knock the handle off,

543
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,025
and let's suppose they're out there.

544
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,948
We won't be able to lock this again.

545
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,781
- Hey Shep, could you use these?

546
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:36,550
- Bingo, skeleton key.

547
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,423
- That's appropriate for this place.

548
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:47,681
Ready?

549
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:09,700
Easy, easy.

550
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,423
- Listen, there's the door.

551
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,170
Go through it, turn right.

552
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,092
The elevator's about 100 feet.

553
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,929
- What is this place?

554
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,636
- It's the evidence storage room.

555
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,226
- It's where they keep
the stuff from the bodies.

556
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,231
- Hey, hold it just a minute.

557
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,651
Let me just have that, right?

558
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,029
You've heard of pipe bombs?

559
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,655
I mean it's diffused but still.

560
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:46,904
- Look at this.

561
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,207
This is great.

562
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,837
- Floofsoms!

563
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:04,763
Floofsoms!

564
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,225
- Poopinplatz, if we can hear her, then.

565
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:25,950
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

566
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,528
- Go ahead, honey.

567
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,469
<i>'</i> Gan!

568
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,014
Oh!

569
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:33,935
Damn!

570
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:31,738
Get back!

571
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,837
- The elevator, somebody's
coming down here.

572
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,013
- Stop 'em, I don't want anyone down here!

573
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,215
- Dana!

574
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,221
- No, but he's got the gun.

575
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,052
- Damn, come on Shep.

576
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,872
- Poopinplatz, are you okay?

577
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,791
- Well, no thanks to you.

578
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,465
What the hell are these things?

579
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:45,062
- Shit.

580
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,536
<i>- Ah, oh'.!</i>

581
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:46,628
- [Jersey] Come on.

582
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:47,920
- No, no, I got her,
you take care of that.

583
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:43,889
- Wait a second.

584
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,211
- Over here.

585
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:12,835
Come on, come on, try and get it out.

586
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:16,797
- Here, here.

587
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:36,105
- Hey, here, take the gun.

588
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,242
No, not like that, come on,

589
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,865
hold it away from your
body and hold it tight.

590
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,537
If you have to use it, it kicks.

591
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,081
- Just hurry, okay?

592
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,326
I don't wanna find out.

593
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:52,249
" Oh!_

594
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,000
' [Jersey] Mullin!

595
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:55,836
- Jersey!

596
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:57,712
Hey!

597
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,593
We're okay, I'm okay, we're okay.

598
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,764
- Where are you there?

599
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,555
- I'm at the elevator.

600
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,012
One of those things is dead.

601
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,895
- There's another one dead
in the toxicology lab.

602
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,314
Can you get outta there?

603
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,189
- Yeah, the elevator's trashed.

604
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,694
I shot the shit out of it.

605
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,368
But we're gonna try to climb
up through the escape hatch.

606
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,287
- Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!

607
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,661
There's another one alive
out there, you know?

608
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:36,498
How is she?

609
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:09,826
- Oh shit.

610
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:13,535
You're gonna have to come up here.

611
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,416
I can't reach it.

612
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,167
Maybe if you get on my shoulders.

613
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:02,092
Come on, easy, up.

614
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,254
There you go, come on, come on.

615
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,555
You all right?

616
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,348
Come on, you okay?

617
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,515
Yeah, be careful, it's slippery.

618
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,105
Come on.

619
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:23,988
Well, that was pretty brave.

620
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:27,362
- Not really.

621
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,612
You think I wanted to
stay down there by myself?

622
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,372
I feel safer with you.

623
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,710
- Don't tell Jersey that.

624
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,754
He thinks I'm riding on the badges

625
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,127
of a long line of nepotistic cop.

626
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,549
He'd think you were crazy.

627
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:47,882
- What about you?

628
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,553
Do you think I'm crazy?

629
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:54,848
- Well, no.

630
01:06:56,346 --> 01:07:00,522
I mean, I don't know, maybe
frightened, confused maybe.

631
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,567
- Crazy.

632
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,611
- No, no, I just, I don't understand

633
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,188
how someone like you could--

634
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,114
- What do you mean, someone like me?

635
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,117
- Well, you got stuff goin' for you.

636
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,615
Your whole life's ahead of you.

637
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:17,163
I mean, you're pretty and,

638
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,292
what, what?

639
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,341
- Ah, it's kinda hard
to make sense of it now.

640
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,559
Everything just seemed to
come crashing down, you know?

641
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:40,645
The opportunity was there and I took it.

642
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,811
It was just a stupid, idiotic mistake.

643
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:50,116
- Hey, it's okay, really.

644
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,192
- No, it's not okay!

645
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,121
I tried to kill myself, Gordon!

646
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,328
I mean, I gave into every little thing

647
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,001
that reared its ugly head at me.

648
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,708
I just let life fall apart on me.

649
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,544
I always thought that I was
better than that, stronger,

650
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:12,926
but I wasn't.

651
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,017
I just let it all go.

652
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,895
Shit, I, I just let it go.

653
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,314
- There's always help.

654
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:38,284
- Well.

655
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,581
Should we give it a try?

656
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:45,500
- Yeah.

657
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,636
- There has to be another way
out of here, Shepard, come on.

658
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,515
- The pneumatic delivery doors are busted.

659
01:08:58,509 --> 01:08:59,351
- So's your head.

660
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,602
Take the freight elevator up.

661
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,017
- What freight elevator, where is it?

662
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:06,942
- The morgue.

663
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,364
- [Gordon] Get it, come on.

664
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,993
- Oh, it's no use,
there's too much grease.

665
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:17,616
A monkey couldn't get up there.

666
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,788
- Great, another dead end.

667
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:22,791
Okay, I'll help you down.

668
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,549
The grate, get the grate.

669
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:36,756
Come on!

670
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:38,967
Let's g0!

671
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:39,801
- Gordon!

672
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,057
- Don't worry, I got it!

673
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,568
- What the hell's all the shooting?

674
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,072
- [Gordon] Gotta go, go!

675
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,699
- They're in the air vent,
they're comin' this way.

676
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,706
Let's see, let's see, hand me a box.

677
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,383
- Dana, Dana!

678
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:19,098
- [Dana] Help me, please, help us!

679
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,767
- Just follow my voice,
try to follow my voice.

680
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,636
- [Gordon] It's right behind us!

681
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:25,722
- Come on, come on, hurry up!

682
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,900
- [Dana] It's gonna take me, save me!

683
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,570
- Don't give up, just
keep 00min', keep comin'!

684
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,695
- Come on, come on!

685
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,367
- [Dana] Your voices are getting louder!

686
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,366
- That's it, just a little closer,

687
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,822
come on, just a little more.

688
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,454
- Give me your hand!

689
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,119
Come on, come on.

690
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,249
All right, all right.

691
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,790
Come on, Mullin, come on.

692
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,467
- Come on, Mullin,
Jersey, give me the gun.

693
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:55,384
- [Gordon] Okay.

694
01:10:56,794 --> 01:11:00,048
- Come on, come on, I got ya, I got ya.

695
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,517
- It's all right.

696
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,235
- Oh, that doesn't look good at all.

697
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:57,814
How ya doin', it hurt?

698
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,320
- It's okay, okay.

699
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:01,993
- How 'bout you two?

700
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,195
- Yeah, nothin' a good,
long vacation wouldn't fix.

701
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,029
- How 'bout two tickets

702
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,115
on a freight elevator outta here, huh?

703
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:07,994
Come on, Shep, show us where

704
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,122
that freight elevator is, come on.

705
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,794
- Come on, Poopinplatz, let's go.

706
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:12,711
God damn.

707
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:18,793
- Come on, let's go.

708
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:19,718
- She okay?

709
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:24,224
- One of those things force
fed her a chunk of its skin.

710
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,049
It's probably poison.

711
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:26,601
- Hey, Jersey, what about
that thing in there?

712
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,849
- Well, it's not going anywhere,

713
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,020
but we gotta get out of here first,

714
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,814
and then I'll send over a couple of units.

715
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:32,731
They'll stop it.

716
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,401
- What if they can't stop it?

717
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,399
- Well, this'll stop it.

718
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,778
Those things sure aren't immune
to concentrated firepower.

719
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,610
- What, did you kill one of 'em with that?

720
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:44,785
- Yeah.

721
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:45,953
- Well, where'd ya hit it?

722
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,531
- I put two slugs and one
went right through it.

723
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:49,865
- I blew its chest apart.

724
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,201
- Well, that figures.

725
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,168
Folklore does center evil in the heart.

726
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,794
- You mean, like killing
a vampire or somethin'?

727
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:06,178
- Well, I'm gonna tell ya something,

728
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,010
after what I've seen here
today, I'll believe anything.

729
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,564
- Whoa, ha, ha, ha, ha!

730
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,321
What, no levity?

731
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,153
Is everything broken around here?

732
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,112
Even humor?

733
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:29,867
Shit.

734
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:33,996
Ah.

735
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,582
Ooh.

736
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:45,299
Look familiar?

737
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,936
You guys havin' some weird
party around here or something?

738
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,586
- Shoot the heart, shoot the heart!

739
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,315
- No, Jersey, don't.

740
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,272
Don't, you probably have a concussion.

741
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,449
- What, on this head?

742
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:54,780
Never.

743
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:58,534
Hey.

744
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,205
Hey, come here.

745
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,299
I'm sorry I got you into this, kid.

746
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:13,929
- [Alley] NQ_

747
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,723
- I never thought that--

748
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:16,640
- No, Jersey.

749
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,515
I'm the one that owes
apologies around here,

750
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,267
to you,

751
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,903
to all those people that I turned away.

752
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,958
It's just nothin' made sense anymore.

753
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,164
People either wanted somethin' from me

754
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,882
or they wanted to burn
me at the nearest stake.

755
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,599
It sure the hell wasn't my life anymore.

756
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:02,765
I wanted out.

757
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:12,063
You were right.

758
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,614
I was building my own tomb.

759
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,917
Oh my god, Jersey!

760
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:25,788
Mullin!

761
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,212
- [Gordon] Oh my god!

762
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,667
- Don't!

763
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,377
- Jesus, he's worse than I thought.

764
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:35,677
We gotta get outta here.

765
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,639
There's gotta be another way outta here.

766
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,113
Okay.

767
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,372
Okay, everybody, stand back, all right?

768
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,000
- It was waitin' for us.

769
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,455
- Oh my god, run!

770
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,166
Here, come on!

771
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,487
Well, now what?

772
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,535
- Climb, climb!

773
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,162
Go, Alley, you or Jersey next.

774
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:53,993
- No, you go, Jersey!

775
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,882
I got it, I got it.

776
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,008
- Come on, Dana, come on.

777
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,638
Hey, come on!

778
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:55,187
Come on, Dana, it's all of us.

779
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:56,104
Alley!

780
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:15,619
Hurry!

781
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:31,965
- Damn dog.

782
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:44,566
- Hey. Alley!

783
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,907
Alley, come on!

784
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,422
Aw, get down!

785
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:34,327
- Hey Alley, Alley, are you okay?

786
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,291
- I'm fine, I'm Okay-

787
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,162
- The dog, what about?

788
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,087
- Dead.

789
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:47,586
Barbecued.

790
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:53,217
- Can you make it outta there?

791
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:56,551
- I can wait, just take care of Jersey.

792
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,355
- Okay, don't move, just stay put.

793
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:03,023
Help is on its way.

794
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,232
- All right, I'm fine.

795
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:11,235
I'll be here.

796
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:32,339
Hey Floofsoms, Floofsoms,
here boy, here boy!

797
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,462
Here boy, here boy.

798
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:40,422
Fetch this!

799
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:27,428
It's all right, it's all right.

800
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:33,605
No more running, Dana.

801
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:34,526
No more.

802
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:40,277
- Alley!

803
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:46,242
Alley, Alley, Alley, thank God.

804
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:50,951
Oh, oh, oh.

805
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:55,706
- It's all right.

806
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,297
It's all right.

807
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:07,679
Oh.

808
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:50,436
# In a world full of heartache #

809
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:54,105
# No one needs heartbreak <i>J"</i>

810
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:57,025
# But too many nights it found me #

811
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:02,106
# It wrapped its cold and
lonely arms around me #

812
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,615
# And if I hear one more sad song #

813
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:11,574
# About broken dreams
and lives gone wrong #

814
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,751
# I swear I'll go crazy #

815
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:19,832
# Because I believe that
love can be forever #

816
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,217
# It takes a brave
heart, strong and true #

817
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:30,051
# To stand behind the
words, baby, I love you #

818
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,262
# A brave heart willing to fight #

819
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:37,100
# For that one love the
rest of their life #

820
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:40,561
# It takes a brave heart <i>J"</i>

821
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:57,336
# So many temptations lead
to compromising situations #

822
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:04,631
# Words spoken easy in
the thrill of the night #

823
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:09,385
# Are meant to please me #

824
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:13,059
# But I don't take love lightly #

825
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:17,184
# I need more just a body beside me #

826
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:20,268
# More than a feeling #

827
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:25,322
# Because I believe that
love can be forever #

828
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:31,616
# It takes a brave
heart, strong and true #

829
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:35,541

833
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:02,017

834
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:05,695
# Through games life can play #

835
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:10,617
# I need someone who's
not afraid to stay #

836
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:21,373
