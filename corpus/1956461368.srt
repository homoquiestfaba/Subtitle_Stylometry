00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:08,678
(Somber piano music)

2
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:12,683
- (Narrator) Vera
did as she was told

3
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:17,185
and went with her killers,
knowing she was going to die.

4
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,689
- (Nicole) Then
he was just like,

5
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,691
"Get your coat and shoes on now.

6
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:21,694
"We're leavin', we're
goin' for a walk."

7
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:24,194
- When they told her to
put her shoes on, you know,

8
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:26,196
she kinda, she was
like yelling, "Why?

9
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:27,198
Ya know, like, "Why?"

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,699
"Why do you want me
to get my shoes on?"

11
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,202
And Zachary went
up to her and said,

12
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,702
"Just get your
"effin' shoes on."

13
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:34,705
- (Narrator) Had she
been given one final wish

14
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:37,207
it would've been to say
goodbye to Willadean,

15
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,709
her precious little girl.

16
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,714
But instead her
last farewell came

17
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:45,214
from the baby's grandmother
who knew this was the end.

18
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:49,217
- And as I laid my head
down all I seen was a vision

19
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:54,723
of Danny, Nicole, and
Vera's purple hoodie,

20
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:57,727
of them walking
outside on the porch.

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,734
And I said, "Goodnight, Vera,"
and she said, "Goodnight."

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,234
She said, "Goodnight, Sugar
Babe," and I said, "Goodnight."

23
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:08,238
- (Narrator) She had
15 minutes to live.

(train whistle blows)

42
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,858
- (Narrator) The case began
on a cold spring morning.

43
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,363
- They had her layin',
instead of having her layin'

44
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,863
on the rails they had her

45
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,866
layin' in between the tracks.

46
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,868
- It's like, here's the two
tracks, she was in the middle

47
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,870
and he was goin' so
fast with the train

48
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:20,882
that he looked down and thought

49
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:22,372
that it was a baby deer.

50
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:24,874
- And the engine and
eight cars went over her.

51
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,877
- He stops the train,
gets out, and walks back

52
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,382
thinking that he was gonna
find the carcass of a deer.

53
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,382
Because the train, the
cars were still over her,

54
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:34,885
looks under, sees
that it's a human.

55
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:36,887
(Phone buzzing)

56
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,389
- (Officer Biggs) Findlay
Police Department, Biggs.

57
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,890
- (Chris) Hello, this is
Chris with CSX Railroad.

58
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:41,393
- (Officer Biggs) Yes.

59
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:42,393
- (Chris) Hey, we
just got a report

60
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:43,394
that we have a train
stopped over near

61
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:44,895
Central Parkway.

62
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:47,397
Right in between there
across from Blanchard River.

63
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,399
- (Officer Biggs) Okay.

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,900
- (Chris) We got a report
that we have a train

65
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,904
stopped right now
because they see a

66
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:54,904
naked female body laying
in the middle of the track.

67
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:57,407
Appears to be deceased.

68
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,409
- (Narrator) The location
of this grizzly discovery

69
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,914
could not have
been more symbolic.

70
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:05,414
On a train trestle in the
center of Findlay, Ohio,

71
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:08,917
a town once designated by
an official act of Congress

72
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,431
as Flag City, USA.

73
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:14,924
It was known for its
good schools, low crime,

74
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,927
and famous sports stars.

75
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,933
And little girls dream of
becoming homecoming queens

76
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:21,933
and cheerleaders.

77
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:25,434
(Crowd cheering)

78
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:28,937
- (Crowd) We're in it to win
it so let's take the floor

79
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:31,443
of (mumbles).

80
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,443
(Spectators cheer)

81
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:34,945
- (Narrator) But now
someone had taken a knife

82
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:37,947
to this picture of
all-American bliss

83
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,953
and left one little girl
under the central overpass,

84
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,453
slashed, bruised,
and slaughtered.

85
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:47,456
- After I found out, you
know, she got murdered

86
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,959
and everything it broke my heart

87
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:55,463
because me and my sister
did everything together.

88
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,468
(Somber ambient music)

89
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,970
- (Narrator) Two months
earlier Findlay Police

90
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:02,474
responded to a
domestic violence call

91
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:03,974
at 300 Center Street.

92
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:07,976
This was not the first time
Vera's abuse had been reported.

93
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
But if anyone was
paying attention,

94
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:12,484
they would've seen the
violence getting worse.

95
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:15,484
- I was there a few times
when the cops was called.

96
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:16,487
They'd come,

97
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,989
be like, "We need
to speak to Vera,"

98
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:22,995
and Zachary and Cheri
and them would tell her,

99
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:24,995
"Don't say Zachary
did anything."

100
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:27,996
Or be like, "You
fell down the steps."

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,003
"You did it, it was your fault."

102
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,003
- (Narrator) Only this time
the quote "I tripped and fell"

103
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:36,006
excuse would not work.

104
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:39,508
A problem soon solved
with a better lie.

105
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:41,521
- When her boyfriend,

106
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:44,515
oh what is his name?

107
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,519
- They said it was a
black dude, that I guess

108
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:52,024
she was supposedly dating,

109
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:56,024
but I believe he was
a created character

110
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:59,528
as they call it in
the video game world.

111
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:05,533
- I can't even think of
his name now but it's...

112
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,537
Demetrius Jones I think it was.

113
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,550
- She made up the Desmond
Thompson guy from Lima.

114
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:16,545
- And he had busted her nose.

115
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:18,048
'Cause she had to go
out to the hospital

116
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,550
'cause she had a bump
here and they said

117
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:21,553
she might have a
concussion and bleeding.

118
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,553
- They come up with
this story sayin'

119
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:27,555
that Vera had a
boyfriend, a black man,

120
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,559
that was out of
Lima or somewhere

121
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:31,063
and he come up here
and got in a fight

122
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,063
and punched her in the
face and broke her nose,

123
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,065
but that's not true.

124
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:35,566
It was her son Zachary.

125
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,567
- He came downstairs,
went straight to his mom,

126
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,580
asked her what happened.

127
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,075
Cheri just came up
with an excuse sayin'

128
00:06:45,077 --> 00:06:47,577
that Vera was the one that
pushed her own daughter

129
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,079
into the coffee table.

130
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,582
And Zachary just listened
to what she said,

131
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:56,085
went over to Vera,
and swung his fist

132
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:57,588
and hit her right in the face.

133
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:00,592
- (Narrator) Even more
chilling is what happened next

134
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,592
when Zach and Cheri
brought in a third party

135
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,595
to finish the beating.

136
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:08,597
- Zach had got a
hold of his Aunt Sam

137
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,610
and when Vera didn't give
her a straight answer,

138
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:17,106
Sam, Samantha, just
straight up punched her

139
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,109
in the face again.

140
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:21,113
- And broke her nose.
- And broke her nose.

141
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,113
- (Narrator) This January
assault is a glaring example

142
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:26,615
of how the system failed Vera.

143
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:27,618
- They talked to me
and Vera both together

144
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,119
'cause Vera wouldn't
talk to nobody

145
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:31,623
unless I was there
in front of her.

146
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:33,623
- She wasn't allowed to
talk unless she was told

147
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,125
to talk by Cheri.

148
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:36,627
Nobody else, just Cheri.

149
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:38,128
Cheri had to be the one to
tell her she could talk.

150
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,640
- That astounds me to this day.

151
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:43,634
That the police did it or

152
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,635
wasn't there a
social worker there?

153
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,137
I mean, it's just
sort of Police 101

154
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,639
that you say, "I wanna
know what she's gonna say

155
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,140
"and I know that woman's
gonna get in the way,

156
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:53,145
"so I'm taking her somewhere
else and she's staying there."

157
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:54,645
They could've done that.

158
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:56,646
They could've said,
"No, you're not coming.

159
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:57,648
"You're stayin' there."

160
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,649
- (Narrator) Except
telling Cheri no

161
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:02,154
is easier said than done.

162
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:02,161
Is easier said than done.

163
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:04,154
- You can tell me to do
something but that doesn't mean

164
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:06,156
I'm gonna listen to ya.

165
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:08,158
(Somber piano music)

166
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
- (Narrator) To say that
Findlay P.D. was familiar

167
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:12,664
with 300 Center Street
is an understatement.

168
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,664
Even on the day of the murder,
earlier that afternoon,

169
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:19,167
police were dispatched to
break up a neighborhood brawl.

170
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:21,673
- The cops wee there
earlier because of a fight

171
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:25,173
that I guess broke out,
'cause I was woken up.

172
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:26,677
- (Narrator) And while
they knocked at the door,

173
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:28,678
Cheri was busy inside.

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,184
- How I got woken up
was Cheri, my mother,

175
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,184
sent Vera up to wake me up.

176
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:35,686
- They had to hide Vera

177
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,687
'cause the police
woulda taken her out

178
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:40,189
if they'd have seen
how bruised up she was.

179
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:42,194
- (Narrator) But the police
were not there for Vera.

180
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,194
They'd been called
to a street fight.

181
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:47,696
- There was a fight
between Danny and my kids

182
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,702
with the people down the street.

183
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,702
- Zachary, Garth, Chuckie,
Danny, and Nicole.

184
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:56,707
They all went down there

185
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,708
- Danny had got outta prison,
like, three weeks before

186
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,210
all this happened.

187
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:01,722
- (Narrator) A detail
that made the officers

188
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,713
immediately worried.

189
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:06,215
- Like, when I first met him
I was actually kinda like

190
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:08,718
intimidated 'cause he
has tears on his eyes.

191
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,223
- That lets other inmates know
once you walk in the door,

192
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,723
See this?

193
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:13,724
I killed once,

194
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:14,725
I will do it again.

195
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:15,726
- (Narrator) The
fight was finished

196
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:17,227
by the time police arrived.

197
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:18,729
And while they interrogated
the other gang,

198
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,234
the Brooks boys were in the
house getting ready to flee.

199
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,234
- You can't tell me Daniel
and Nicole's the only one

200
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:26,236
that escaped the house because
they don't know Findlay.

201
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:27,738
They're from Tiffin.

202
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,739
- He had went over to, um...

203
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:35,744
Dave and Sam's to hide
out, is what I heard.

204
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,247
'Cause they, I remember
seein' 'em jump out my window

205
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,250
and told Nicky, "Let's go.

206
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:41,762
And they jumped out the window

207
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:43,253
and went over to Dave and Sam's.

208
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:44,755
- (Narrator) Playing
a much greater role

209
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:47,256
would be the third person who
jumped out Cheri's window,

210
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,258
her son Zachary.

211
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,271
- (Nicole) Me, Danny,
and Zach were actually

212
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:55,263
running from the police
because Danny had pulled out

213
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:58,267
a knife on one of the
Brooks's neighbors.

214
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,274
Zach had a warrant and I knew
I had a warrant in Tiffin.

215
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,274
- (Narrator) In that short
run from the Brooks house here

216
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:08,777
to the Schwabb house there,
Zachary, Danny, and Nicole

217
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,790
began a chain of events that
would end five hours later

218
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,284
with Vera dead on the tracks.

219
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:18,788
- And they ran to
this house right here

220
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,300
and that's where Cheri
even admitted they were at,

221
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,294
was right here, and how
close is that to the tracks

222
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:27,798
where Vera was murdered?

223
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,809
- (Narrator) But right then
police had one priority,

224
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,302
to find the guy running around
Findlay flashing a knife

225
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:35,305
and wearing a teardrop tattoo.

226
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:38,307
(Somber piano music)

227
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:46,816
In the first news reports
it seemed that Daniel Bixler

228
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:49,817
was some crazy distant cousin
who blew in from Tiffin,

229
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:52,324
a town 25 miles east of Findlay.

230
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:53,824
An impression
supported by the fact

231
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:56,325
that only three weeks
before he had been released

232
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:58,328
from Allen correctional
after serving

233
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,829
almost three years in prison.

234
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,341
- He admitted he was in
a gang at the prison,

235
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,333
the 211 boys as he called it.

236
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:05,835
- (Narrator) Once free,
Danny went on a spree

237
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:09,337
of escalating violence,
beginning at this park where,

238
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:11,851
in an act of twisted
chivalry, he attacked

239
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,843
a teenager who had refused
to give up a park swing

240
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:18,346
to his new girlfriend
Nicole Peters.

241
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,350
It was this assault charge
that sent the fugitive couple

242
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:24,356
on the lamb, fleeing Tiffin
before Danny got arrested.

243
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:25,856
- Yeah, he ran away from it.

244
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:28,357
That's why he came
to Findlay, to hide.

245
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
- (Narrator) The reason Danny
felt comfortable turning

246
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:31,363
to Cheri is obvious.

247
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:34,363
He was not a distant
cousin at all,

248
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:37,366
but a close member
of the family.

249
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:38,869
Best illustrated by
Cheri's relationship

250
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,380
with the other Danny
Bixler, his father.

251
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,375
- Oh yeah.

252
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:47,377
Danny and I go,

253
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:50,882
they call us the
kissing cousins.

254
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,882
- (Narrator) From this
incestuous romance,

255
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,384
Cheri conceived the first
of her nine children,

256
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,387
Scottie Emmons.

257
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,393
- Scottie Emmons belongs
to Danny Bixler, Sr.

258
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,393
Her mother's sister's kid,
he would be her cousin.

259
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:07,896
- The incest kind of stuff
that's in our family.

260
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,909
- (Narrator) In 2008, Big
Danny stabbed his wife's lover

261
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:13,402
and led police and sheriffs
from three different counties

262
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:16,905
on a high speed chase
in an 18-ton semi.

263
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:19,908
- When he gets a
temper, both of them,

264
00:12:19,911 --> 00:12:22,914
when they get a temper,
you can't handle 'em.

265
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:25,914
- Even Danny had said
it's in the Bixler blood.

266
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,917
I'm meant to kill, I guess.

267
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,419
- (Narrator) For a
homicide that started out

268
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:31,423
with a naked dead
woman with no ID,

269
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:31,431
with a naked dead
woman with no ID,

270
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:33,923
no witnesses, no murder
weapon, no suspects,

271
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:37,425
and no apparent
motive, Findlay police

272
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,429
solved the case incredibly fast.

273
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:40,932
- She had been to
the hospital before.

274
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:40,941
- She had been to
the hospital before.

275
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:42,432
There was a social
worker involved.

276
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:42,934
She had bruises.

277
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,434
She had been beat.

278
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:47,936
So, it's not like, you
know, this was a surprise.

279
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:57,445
- I will make sure that they
now that Desta Bixler, uh--

280
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:03,955
- Danny, when he was drunk,
he kind of basically told her

281
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:03,961
- Danny, when he was drunk,
he kind of basically told her

282
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:05,455
every single detail

283
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:06,957
about the murder.

284
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,962
- While we were drinkin' they
were smokin' all my cigarettes

285
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:10,968
- While we were drinkin' they
were smokin' all my cigarettes

286
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,462
so we decide to go down
to the gas station,

287
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:14,965
which isn't that far from here,

288
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:19,466
and so we walk down there and
we see the train has stopped.

289
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:21,973
And then I'm, like,
sittin' here thinking,

290
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:21,981
And then I'm, like,
sittin' here thinking,

291
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:24,473
like, why is the train stopped

292
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:27,976
at like three-somethin'
in the morning?

293
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:30,479
I asked the lady
at the gas station,

294
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,484
I'm like, "Do you know
why the train stopped?"

295
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:32,492
I'm like, "Do you know
why the train stopped?"

296
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,484
I'm like, "Was there somethin'
wrong with the engine?"

297
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:36,986
Just bein' nosy, and she's
like, "No, they found a body."

298
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:40,992
And I looked back at Danny
and he's just staring.

299
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:40,998
And I looked back at Danny
and he's just staring.

300
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:42,492
Like, he's froze

301
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:45,495
and right then I knew.

302
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:49,998
I knew everything that
was bein' said was true.

303
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:52,503
I mean, I was scared.

304
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,004
- (Narrator) In addition
to Desta's information,

305
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,005
police also learn
that there had been

306
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:58,507
an eyewitness after all.

307
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,010
- Across the street

308
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:03,014
from the Brooks's home,
there was a camera out there

309
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:03,021
from the Brooks's home,
there was a camera out there

310
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,014
for surveillance

311
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:08,516
and they seen them
walk across the street.

312
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,022
- (Narrator) The grainy
video shows three figures,

313
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:11,030
- (Narrator) The grainy
video shows three figures,

314
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,522
Danny Bixler, Vera
Reigle, and Nicole Peters,

315
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:17,526
in a single file
line walking south.

316
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,032
- They did have the
knife towards her.

317
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:21,039
- They did have the
knife towards her.

318
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,032
If she was screamin' or
anything that they would

319
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:24,534
stab her right then and there.

320
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,536
- (Narrator) Confronted
with this mounting evidence

321
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,538
Danny first tried to
push blame on others

322
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,042
then started making
damning admissions.

323
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:31,050
Then started making
damning admissions.

324
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,542
By mid-afternoon he
and his interrogators

325
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:35,045
were driving back
to the train bridge,

326
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:36,546
returning to the scene

327
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:37,548
of the crime.

328
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:44,554
- (Narrator) There he
pointed to the spot where

329
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:47,555
just 18 hours earlier he
threw the murder weapon

330
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,059
into the water.

331
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,063
- The blade that he used
was from the kitchen.

332
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:52,070
- The blade that he used
was from the kitchen.

333
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,063
- Danny tooked it
outta my knife set

334
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:59,066
and he was playin' with it
and twirlin' and all that.

335
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,573
- (Narrator) For her part,
Nicole was more tightlipped

336
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:01,580
- (Narrator) For her part,
Nicole was more tightlipped

337
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,573
and to this day
exactly what she did

338
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:06,075
at the tracks remains a mystery.

339
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:08,576
But she still was not
as skilled at lying

340
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,580
as the Brooks family
and it did not take long

341
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:13,585
for her to implicate
herself as well.

342
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:13,592
For her to implicate
herself as well.

343
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:16,585
The detectives had
caught the murderers.

344
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:21,092
- The people that were
charged were Daniel Bixler,

345
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:21,098
- The people that were
charged were Daniel Bixler,

346
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,592
Nicole Peters,

347
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:26,094
and then people that
lied to the police,

348
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:30,598
which there's quite
a few of those.

349
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,611
Zachary Brooks, Cheri Brooks,

350
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:36,605
Shannon Brooks,
and Michael Brooks.

351
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:41,118
And then they have a juvenile
son that also participated

352
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:45,113
in lyin' to the police and
his name is Chuck Brooks.

353
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:47,116
- (Narrator) And so
everyone zeroed in on Danny,

354
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:49,618
the out of control
ex-con, and Nicole,

355
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:51,623
his bloodthirsty girlfriend.

356
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:51,631
His bloodthirsty girlfriend.

357
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:52,623
- (Judge) How old are you today?

358
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:54,124
- 18.

359
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,125
- (Judge) How old were you when
this offense was committed?

360
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,128
- 17.

361
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:00,129
- Some girls go
for the bad boys.

362
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:02,634
Like a Bonnie and
Clyde kinda thing,

363
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:02,641
Like a Bonnie and
Clyde kinda thing,

364
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:04,634
but with a evil
twist. (Chuckles)

365
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:06,636
- (Nicole) I've known
him since I was younger.

366
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:11,148
I met him at the Seneca County
Juvenile Detention Center

367
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:15,144
and I used to hang
out with his brother,

368
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:19,146
Richard Bixler a lot and
that's how I met Danny.

369
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,654
- She was obsessed
with this man.

370
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:22,661
- She was obsessed
with this man.

371
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:24,654
Like, she'd constantly
talk about him.

372
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:27,156
Everything, all of her
letters were about how much

373
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:28,158
she was devoted to him,

374
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,159
how much she loved him.

375
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,660
She cared about him a lot.

376
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:32,664
- They had only been together
for, like, a week and a half.

377
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:32,672
- They had only been together
for, like, a week and a half.

378
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:34,164
So, he was out for
a week and a half

379
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:37,165
and then they started dating
for the other week and a half

380
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:40,668
that he was out and then boom,
he was right back in again.

381
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:43,182
(Piano music)

382
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:46,176
- (Narrator) An indication
of how authorities struggled

383
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:48,177
with this bizarre case
from the very beginning

384
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:51,182
is that they did not inform
the public for a day and a half

385
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:51,189
is that they did not inform
the public for a day and a half

386
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,182
after the body was discovered.

387
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:55,184
- Vera's mom didn't
even find out about it

388
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,686
from the police or anybody.

389
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,188
They went directly
to Cheri first.

390
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:00,189
And I think that's a
bunch of crap, you know.

391
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:02,193
The police department
wouldn't go directly

392
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:02,201
The police department
wouldn't go directly

393
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,693
to her own mother?

394
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:08,197
- No, 'cause Cheri
already identified it.

395
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,704
Because Cheri told the police
that Vera's parents died.

396
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:12,708
Because Cheri told the police
that Vera's parents died.

397
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,704
I'm supposed to be dead.

398
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:16,205
I've died like three
different times

399
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:18,707
in three different states.

400
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,210
- Cheri.

401
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,213
- (Narrator) These deceptions,
which she hones over time,

402
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:22,221
- (Narrator) These deceptions,
which she hones over time,

403
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:24,213
come in two types.

404
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,715
Lies to protect

405
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:28,217
and lies to instigate.

406
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,719
What happened next

407
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:31,222
is an example of the former.

408
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:31,231
Is an example of the former.

409
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:33,722
- We met Larry one time
because he stopped out front

410
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:36,725
of our house and
Samantha, Schwabb,

411
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:38,728
was at our house
and she went outside

412
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,730
and smacked Larry because
they got into a fight

413
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:42,734
because they owed
money to her and stuff.

414
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:42,742
Because they owed
money to her and stuff.

415
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,734
And he started talkin' to us

416
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:47,236
and then next thing I know
he started hangin' around

417
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:49,738
our house like a leech.

418
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:51,242
- The Larry Spencer
guy shows up,

419
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:51,251
- The Larry Spencer
guy shows up,

420
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:53,242
this guy who's been at the house

421
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,244
once or twice suddenly is,

422
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,746
is being accused
of takin' Vera away

423
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,249
and probably killin' her.

424
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,750
- Because I've talked
to Larry and Larry said

425
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:03,254
that they tried to
tell the detectives

426
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:03,262
that they tried to
tell the detectives

427
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:04,754
that it was him that killed her.

428
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,756
- (Narrator) To those who
knew about Vera's life

429
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,758
inside the Brooks house,
the story on its face

430
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,260
was ridiculous.

431
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,263
- They said, "Oh, she took
off with her boyfriend.

432
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:16,264
Well, she wasn't really
allowed to have a boyfriend

433
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:18,767
except for Zachary
'cause she wasn't allowed

434
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,770
to go anywhere with anybody.

435
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:23,274
- They wouldn't even let
her have a cell phone.

436
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:23,282
- They wouldn't even let
her have a cell phone.

437
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,274
- Cheri said that
she didn't need one

438
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:27,776
because then she could
get a hold of her mom

439
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,779
or she could talk to
whoever she wanted to.

440
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:31,783
- (Narrator) After Danny
and Nicole were arrested,

441
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:31,791
- (Narrator) After Danny
and Nicole were arrested,

442
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,783
the cover story was modified
to fit the changing situation.

443
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:36,286
- She'll basically
change the story up

444
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,287
and she'll basically
confuse everybody.

445
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:42,299
- And she's tryin' to
cover up a murder, period.

446
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:46,295
- (Narrator) The witch's
spell had worked like a charm.

447
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:50,297
- I believe that my own mother
had this set up perfectly.

448
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:53,802
She knew exactly how to do it.

449
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:56,305
- She can get away with shit.

450
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:00,808
There are certain
things that she's done

451
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:03,313
in her life that

452
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:05,814
shoulda been put
her behind bars.

453
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:08,817
It was pretty much (hand
smacks) slap on the hand,

454
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,320
go ahead, walk away.

455
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,323
- (Narrator) Gone were any
questions about what role

456
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:12,331
- (Narrator) Gone were any
questions about what role

457
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:15,323
she and her family
played in Vera's death.

458
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:17,826
- You just not wanna
say my name on there

459
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:20,329
sayin' that I had
anything to do with this.

460
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:21,332
- (Narrator) Now it was as if

461
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:21,341
- (Narrator) Now it was as if

462
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:23,332
they were just
passive spectators.

463
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,334
The only thing
people wanted to know

464
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:27,836
was how they could sit there
and watch Danny and Nicole

465
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,839
do something so barbaric.

466
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:32,343
- I asked her a million times.

467
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:32,351
- I asked her a million times.

468
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,843
Cheri, why didn't you call?

469
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:37,347
Why?

470
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,350
Why?

471
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,353
- I mean, even a
five year-old knows,

472
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:42,362
- I mean, even a
five year-old knows,

473
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:44,853
if somebody's being hurt
you call the police.

474
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:46,856
- (Narrator) And as the
accusations intensified,

475
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:50,858
the truth of what happened
got further and further away.

476
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:52,864
- Like someone's really gonna
be there to help me say,

477
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:52,872
- Like someone's really gonna
be there to help me say,

478
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:56,864
"Hey, go get the phone over
there off of my computer stand

479
00:19:56,868 --> 00:19:58,368
"so I can call the cops."

480
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,869
You know, they're not gonna,

481
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,372
Nicky's not gonna
give me the phone.

482
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:01,380
Nicky's not gonna
give me the phone.

483
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,872
Dan's not gonna
give me the phone.

484
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:05,374
Scottie sure in the world's
not gonna give me the phone.

485
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:07,876
And Shannon, her fat ass
was sittin' on the couch

486
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:08,879
playin' with her phone.

487
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,390
- I wish I would've had...

488
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:14,883
my phone working because it was,

489
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,386
well, it was dead
and I had no minutes

490
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:20,388
even though I know you can
call 911 off of it, but...

491
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:23,401
(somber piano music)

492
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:36,904
- No matter her age,
Vera was still a child.

493
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,412
- If there's a way she could
do it, she would do it.

494
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:41,420
- If there's a way she could
do it, she would do it.

495
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,412
You know, never
complained, always help.

496
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,415
She'd help ya any way she could.

497
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,917
- If you told Vera
something she'd do it.

498
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,419
I mean, she didn't question.

499
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,423
Almost to the point
that it was too much.

500
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:52,430
Almost to the point
that it was too much.

501
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,423
I wish she could've maybe

502
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:54,424
stood up for herself
a little more.

503
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:56,425
- She was mentally challenged.

504
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:57,927
She was slow.

505
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:00,929
- And Cheri and them end up
talkin' her into movin' in

506
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:03,935
with them and, you know,
and then she end up

507
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:03,942
with them and, you know,
and then she end up

508
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,935
hookin' up with Cheri's son.

509
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:07,937
- (Narrator) For Vera,
her old life was gone,

510
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:11,943
like she had joined a cult and
got separated from her past.

511
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:11,949
Like she had joined a cult and
got separated from her past.

512
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:14,943
- When Manson put
ideas in his minions

513
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:18,447
to where he's pretty
much the puppet master

514
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:22,459
and he's doing his puppets to
do his dirty works for him.

515
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:25,955
- Brooks family being
like the Manson family,

516
00:21:25,957 --> 00:21:27,457
yeah, I would have
to agree with that.

517
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,458
They are like that.

518
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:31,469
- They're a family
that makes sense,

519
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:35,464
whatever she meant by that.

520
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:36,966
- Yes.

521
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:37,968
- It's a cultish type of
thing and I really believe

522
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:39,969
they saw her as an easy target.

523
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,473
- We was at the Salvation
Army and she came in

524
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:42,481
- We was at the Salvation
Army and she came in

525
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:45,473
with the Brookses and she
seen me and she kinda lit up

526
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,476
because she'd always
smile, ya know.

527
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:48,478
Like that, ya know.

528
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,479
And she'd come over,
she put her hood up

529
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:52,483
and then as she walked
by, "Can't talk.

530
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:52,491
And then as she walked
by, "Can't talk.

531
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:53,483
"Can't talk. Can't talk."

532
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:55,484
- She had stopped and I
put my arms around her

533
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,986
and gave her a big hug and
asked her where her baby was

534
00:21:57,989 --> 00:21:58,989
and she said,

535
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,993
"Oh, she's at home," but
boy she just run away.

536
00:22:01,993 --> 00:22:02,000
"Oh, she's at home," but
boy she just run away.

537
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,993
I mean flat run.

538
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:05,994
It wasn't no
stoppin' and talkin'

539
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:07,497
and that's not Vera.

540
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:10,998
- 'Cause they didn't want
her to talk to no one

541
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:13,004
about what was happening

542
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:13,012
about what was happening

543
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:14,004
at the house.

544
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:15,505
That's what they were afraid of.

545
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:18,506
- They basically did not
allow Vera to maintain

546
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,009
a relationship with her parents.

547
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:22,012
- (Narrator) It didn't take
long for people to see a change.

548
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:22,021
- (Narrator) It didn't take
long for people to see a change.

549
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:26,013
- Before she started
datin' Zach she was happy.

550
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:29,017
- She was pretty much outgoing.

551
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,023
I mean, she loved to
sing, she liked to dance.

552
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:32,030
I mean, she loved to
sing, she liked to dance.

553
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,523
- Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton.

554
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:38,527
She liked all the older country.

555
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,532
- But once she moved
in with them it just,

556
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:41,539
- But once she moved
in with them it just,

557
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:44,032
she changed real quick.

558
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:47,535
- What I can't see is
the Vera that I knew

559
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,050
willingly massaging
Cheri's feet.

560
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:56,045
- That was her job there,
was to rub her feet.

561
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:58,547
She has foot problems,
diabetes or something.

562
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,049
But that was her job.

563
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:03,053
- And when she did Mom's feet
if she did somethin' wrong

564
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:03,061
- And when she did Mom's feet
if she did somethin' wrong

565
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:05,054
Mom would hit her
with the itchy stick.

566
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:07,056
- Well, Cheri had this like, uh,

567
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:09,058
it's not a backscratcher but
it's a little bit thicker.

568
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
She'd just whap her
alongside the head.

569
00:23:11,062 --> 00:23:12,563
"Don't touch my baby."

570
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:12,572
"Don't touch my baby."

571
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:14,563
- And Vera would just keep
tellin' her, "I'm sorry,

572
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:16,065
"I'm sorry."

573
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:18,567
- She'd say, "I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

574
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:22,573
Why she was sayin' I'm
sorry for, I don't know.

575
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:22,579
Why she was sayin' I'm
sorry for, I don't know.

576
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:26,573
Because I guess she just felt
she was doin' somethin' wrong.

577
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:28,577
- (Narrator) They even
made her sleep with a pig.

578
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:31,079
- You're allowed to have
a pig live in a closet

579
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,084
to where he urinates

580
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:33,092
to where he urinates

581
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:34,584
and has feces all over?

582
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:36,085
- (Wilbert) "Oh no, I'd
never make her sleep

583
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:37,087
"with the pig."

584
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,090
- Of course she did.

585
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,592
She made her sleep with the pig.

586
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:41,601
She made her sleep with the pig.

587
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:43,592
- They had the cops
called continuously.

588
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:46,594
Children's Services
called continuously.

589
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,597
And God knows why
nobody done anything,

590
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,599
you know to even
remove the baby itself

591
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,602
- Exactly.
- Out of that home.

592
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:51,611
- Exactly.
- Out of that home.

593
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:53,102
I don't understand that.

594
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:56,104
- She was such a frequent
flier as well call them

595
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:58,107
that you could answer the phone

596
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,609
and as soon as she
says the first word

597
00:24:00,611 --> 00:24:02,113
you know who it is.

598
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:02,121
You know who it is.

599
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:05,113
You eventually become kinda
desensitized to them calling

600
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:08,616
and it's not that
people mean to do that,

601
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,119
it's just that you know
that the major problems

602
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:13,624
are ones that nobody's
gonna cooperate.

603
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:13,632
Are ones that nobody's
gonna cooperate.

604
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:17,624
- Vera told the cops, "No,
I'm not movin' back home

605
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,128
"with you guys."

606
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,130
And the cop said,
"How old are you?"

607
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:24,635
- Vera's cognitive level I
would compare to my daughter

608
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:24,642
- Vera's cognitive level I
would compare to my daughter

609
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:27,635
who's eight years old, okay?

610
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:29,638
I wouldn't expect the police
to take my daughter's word

611
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,140
for it, you know what I mean?

612
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:35,146
- Because Vera even told
CPS when CPS asked her,

613
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:35,152
- Because Vera even told
CPS when CPS asked her,

614
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:36,646
"Vera are you endanger here?

615
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:38,146
"Do you like it livin' here?"

616
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:39,649
Vera said, "I love Cheri.

617
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,654
"I love stayin' here with
Cheri and her family."

618
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:43,660
"I love stayin' here with
Cheri and her family."

619
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,154
She says, "Cheri's my family.

620
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:46,156
"She helps me out

621
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:47,657
and I would never leave Cheri."

622
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:49,158
- They came back
here and told me

623
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,664
that they talked to her and
because she was 24 years old,

624
00:24:53,664 --> 00:24:53,670
that they talked to her and
because she was 24 years old,

625
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,664
even though her mind was
an eight year-old mind,

626
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,666
they couldn't do anything
because she was 24 years old

627
00:24:57,668 --> 00:24:59,168
and she made her choice.

628
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,173
It was her bed, she
needed to lie in it.

629
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:02,180
It was her bed, she
needed to lie in it.

630
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,673
- (Narrator) It
was total control.

631
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:08,175
- And they'd make her do, like,
just pretty much everything

632
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,179
and nobody else would get up

633
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:12,183
and do somethin'
around the house.

634
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:12,191
And do somethin'
around the house.

635
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:13,183
It was always her.

636
00:25:13,184 --> 00:25:15,184
- They actually treated
her like a slave.

637
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:18,186
- They wanted her as a
slave and her SSI check

638
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:19,689
that she got first of the month.

639
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,690
- That was legal.

640
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:21,692
They got that done.

641
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:21,701
They got that done.

642
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:23,692
Don't know how they
did it and who,

643
00:25:23,694 --> 00:25:25,194
I mean they must know enough.

644
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:28,196
- 'Cause it sounds like they
got a pretty good racket goin'.

645
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:29,699
Maybe I oughta go on SSI

646
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,203
and have people
stay here with me

647
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:32,210
and have people
stay here with me

648
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,203
and they sign over
their paychecks to me.

649
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:37,705
- And each of 'em gettin'
around 700 a month?

650
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,708
Comin' in to one place?

651
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,710
- Cheri's on disability,

652
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:42,713
all of her kids
are on disability,

653
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:42,721
all of her kids
are on disability,

654
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:44,713
and then everybody else
that moves in with them

655
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:46,215
are on disability.

656
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:48,717
- (Narrator) But more
than Vera's money,

657
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,719
Cheri wanted her womb.

658
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:54,723
- Everybody that gets pregnant
that lives in that house,

659
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:56,225
you know, Cheri says,

660
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:57,227
"Oh, I hope you have
a girl," you know.

661
00:25:57,228 --> 00:25:59,228
- (Narrator) Vera
Jo Reigle was killed

662
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,229
because of two
conflicting motives.

663
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:02,233
- I have four kids of my own.

664
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:02,242
- I have four kids of my own.

665
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:04,733
I have three girls and one boy.

666
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:06,235
Well, when I first
had my first daughter

667
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,737
she said she wanted it
because it's a girl.

668
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:11,742
- 'Cause in her mind any
girl that she could get

669
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:11,749
- 'Cause in her mind any
girl that she could get

670
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:13,742
she was gonna get.

671
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:15,244
- (Narrator) The
primary motive was based

672
00:26:15,246 --> 00:26:17,246
in Cheri's obsession
with baby girls,

673
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:20,248
an abnormal perversion
that began in childhood

674
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:24,255
when she, like Vera was sexually
abused by her own father.

675
00:26:24,255 --> 00:26:24,261
When she, like Vera was sexually
abused by her own father.

676
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:28,255
- And he molested her
quite often, I guess.

677
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,759
- (Narrator) The man who
nicknamed her Sugar Babe.

678
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:34,265
- That's her number one name
right there, Sugar Babe.

679
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:34,271
- That's her number one name
right there, Sugar Babe.

680
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:36,265
That's what everybody calls her.

681
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:39,767
- Since I was a little girl
my dad gave that name to me

682
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,773
before I was put
in a foster home.

683
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:42,780
Before I was put
in a foster home.

684
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,773
- I actually felt sorry for her.

685
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:47,775
She did tell me about,
you know, her experiences

686
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:51,278
with her father and
how he had raped her.

687
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:54,792
And I began to kinda
understand a little bit

688
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:59,787
of how this woman come
to be the way she is.

689
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,293
- (Narrator) As a young child,
Cheri and her three siblings

690
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:02,300
- (Narrator) As a young child,
Cheri and her three siblings

691
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,793
became wards of the state.

692
00:27:03,794 --> 00:27:05,794
- She was put in
the children's home,

693
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:09,296
taken away from her mom, when
she was, like, three years old

694
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,800
and then she came
back when she was 16.

695
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,304
- (Narrator) It was then
she made her first attempt

696
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:13,311
- (Narrator) It was then
she made her first attempt

697
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:15,804
to take someone else's baby.

698
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:18,806
- She told us when she
come home and she was 16

699
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,813
that she had a baby
over here in Tiffin

700
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:22,819
that she had a baby
over here in Tiffin

701
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:26,313
and that Welfare
wouldn't let her have it.

702
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:30,317
- And my mother would always
say, "Did you have a baby

703
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:34,325
"while you were in
foster care because if so

704
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:34,331
"while you were in
foster care because if so

705
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:35,825
"I'm gonna go get it."

706
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:37,826
- Because it was Cheri's
baby and that would've been

707
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:41,328
my first grandbaby so
I was gonna get it.

708
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:45,342
But Bea and them said no
it wasn't Cheri's baby

709
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:49,336
it was a foster baby there, too.

710
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,842
It wasn't her baby
in the first place.

711
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:51,850
It wasn't her baby
in the first place.

712
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,342
And then we talked to
Sandy and Sandy Schneider

713
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:59,846
says, that's the welfare
lady that was takin' her case

714
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,354
and stuff, said that
she is an obituary liar

715
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:03,360
and stuff, said that
she is an obituary liar

716
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,854
and that's why, she's
a fantasy world,

717
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:10,858
she lives in a
fantasy world like.

718
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:15,366
And that way whatever she thinks
that's what really happens

719
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:15,371
And that way whatever she thinks
that's what really happens

720
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:16,866
in her world.

721
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:19,367
- Well see, she'll tell ya
somethin' totally opposite

722
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,370
than what everybody
else is tellin' her.

723
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:23,374
She'll lie.

724
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:23,382
She'll lie.

725
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,374
- She many, many
times has done it

726
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:29,376
and people have
fallen in her trickery

727
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,383
and they believe
everything she said.

728
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:32,390
And they believe
everything she said.

729
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,383
- Because she's convincing
about everything.

730
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:38,385
I mean, she convinces
everybody everything.

731
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:41,389
(Somber piano music)

732
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:48,395
- "Who will hold your
hand as each one walks out

733
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,909
"of your home to pain
that will put my mark

734
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:55,904
in your hand," and I'm
talkin' about Cheri

735
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:57,906
losin' all of her
kids one at a time.

736
00:28:57,908 --> 00:28:59,908
- I'm really confused about
all that because I thought

737
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,414
once you have kids taken
that you're not allowed,

738
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:03,420
once you have kids taken
that you're not allowed,

739
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,914
especially if you have five.

740
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:06,915
You have all those kids
taken and then you have

741
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,917
a second round of kids and
you're allowed to keep those?

742
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,419
- They removed
Maria and two other,

743
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:14,425
well Scottie was
one, Michael was one,

744
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:14,432
well Scottie was
one, Michael was one,

745
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:17,925
and then there was another
one but I don't know the name.

746
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:20,428
- Which was Joshua, Michael,
Maria, and little Cheri,

747
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,932
was all taken away from me.

748
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:21,941
Was all taken away from me.

749
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:23,932
- (Narrator) In
three of the cases,

750
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:26,934
she lost custody at least
in part due to reports

751
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:28,937
of sexual abuse.

752
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:30,438
- My sister was comin'
over to pick her up,

753
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:32,942
wantin' to take her
out to her house

754
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:32,951
wantin' to take her
out to her house

755
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:35,443
and railroad tracks is
right beside her house,

756
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:37,446
so there was a train goin' by.

757
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,448
She didn't hear
my sister knockin'

758
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,952
and she was even
hollerin' out Cheri's name

759
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:41,960
and she was even
hollerin' out Cheri's name

760
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,951
and Cheri didn't
answer and she said

761
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:46,954
when she walked in there Cheri
was supposed to be givin',

762
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:48,957
little baby bathtub thing there,

763
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,962
and she was holdin' the
baby up like this here

764
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:51,969
and she was holdin' the
baby up like this here

765
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:53,462
suckin' its penis.

766
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:57,464
- She's sick enough that
she even molested me

767
00:29:57,468 --> 00:29:59,468
when I was younger.

768
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,970
- (Narrator) Cheri's
first five children

769
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:02,473
were not removed as a group.

770
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:02,481
Were not removed as a group.

771
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:04,973
She would have one,
lose it to CPS,

772
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:08,475
then have another over
and over and over.

773
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:10,979
- I seen her more attached
when the baby girl was born

774
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:12,483
than when she was with the boys.

775
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:12,491
Than when she was with the boys.

776
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:13,983
I mean, when that girl was born

777
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:15,484
she wouldn't let her
out of her sight.

778
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:16,986
Let no one hold the baby

779
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:19,487
or if someone did
she would, like,

780
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,992
look at them until
they put the baby down.

781
00:30:21,992 --> 00:30:22,000
Look at them until
they put the baby down.

782
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,492
It was just like,

783
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:25,494
kind of obsess with Maria.

784
00:30:26,997 --> 00:30:28,997
- (Narrator) By all accounts
it was the loss of this child,

785
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:32,002
baby Maria, that
was most traumatic.

786
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:32,009
Baby Maria, that
was most traumatic.

787
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:36,002
- She'll always be my girl,
my little girl, no matter what

788
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:40,006
in that she's my first daughter
and that I always want her

789
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:43,513
to know that she's
always welcomed here

790
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:43,521
to know that she's
always welcomed here

791
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:46,014
to meet me any time she wants.

792
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,523
- Every other kid she had she
didn't take care of right,

793
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:52,529
- Every other kid she had she
didn't take care of right,

794
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:55,023
but Maria, she did
real good with Maria.

795
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:57,025
We really was proud of her.

796
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:59,527
She kept her for a whole year.

797
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,030
- (Narrator) But in
the spring of 1987

798
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:03,534
Cheri reverted to her old ways

799
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:03,541
Cheri reverted to her old ways

800
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:06,034
and things went horribly wrong.

801
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:08,035
- My brother one night
called me up sayin'

802
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,538
that we needed to take
the baby to the hospital,

803
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:13,544
that she had been molested.

804
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:13,552
That she had been molested.

805
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:15,544
She was bleeding
from the vagina.

806
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:18,546
- Somebody had raped
our little Maria

807
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,549
because when she went
to change her diaper

808
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:22,553
she was all bloody down there.

809
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:22,561
She was all bloody down there.

810
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:24,553
- (Narrator) That night
Cheri reclaimed her baby

811
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:28,055
but the authorities
were on her trail.

812
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:31,558
- They told her to take her
to the doctor the next day.

813
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:34,565
Well, Cheri didn't
take her to the doctor.

814
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:34,572
Well, Cheri didn't
take her to the doctor.

815
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:37,065
So, we went over and she says,

816
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:40,568
"Mom, take Maria home with ya."

817
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:42,072
- That was at Easter
time one time.

818
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:42,081
- That was at Easter
time one time.

819
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:45,072
I took Scottie home with
me and I gave her Maria

820
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:46,075
to take home for the night.

821
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:49,576
- And she never let me
take Maria home at all.

822
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
She says, "I'll keep
Scottie over here

823
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:53,584
"and you take Maria home."

824
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:53,592
"And you take Maria home."

825
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:54,584
So, I did.

826
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:57,586
Knock comes to my
door next morning

827
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:00,588
and here it was the
sheriff wantin' Maria.

828
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:03,601
(Somber piano music)

829
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:10,097
(train whistle blows)

830
00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:16,604
- She wanted all of her boys
to at least have one kid

831
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:18,606
by the time they were 16 or 17.

832
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:20,609
- (Narrator) An example
of this is Gina Lopez,

833
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:23,614
a 15 year-old girl with
a troubled family life

834
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:23,621
a 15 year-old girl with
a troubled family life

835
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:27,114
who fell in love with Cheri's
second to youngest son, Garth.

836
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:30,117
- She was like,
"Gimme a grandbaby.

837
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
"I like grandbabies.

838
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:32,623
"I want another grandbaby."

839
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:32,631
"I want another grandbaby."

840
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:35,123
- (Narrator) And as soon as
she was carrying a Brooks baby,

841
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:39,125
like Vera before her, the
stalking and the threats began.

842
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,129
- I had a job at the time.

843
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:44,134
I was workin' at this
little shop at the corner

844
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:44,141
I was workin' at this
little shop at the corner

845
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:47,134
of Center and Main Street.

846
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:49,137
I was workin' there and
they would follow me.

847
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:52,149
- Cheri, Zachary,
Garth, and Chuckie,

848
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:55,143
they all work as a team.

849
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:58,144
- (Gina) Chuckie would be the
one that always followed me

850
00:32:58,148 --> 00:32:59,647
most of the time.

851
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,650
Zachary would sometimes.

852
00:33:01,652 --> 00:33:03,153
- And then when they
knew it was time

853
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:03,162
- And then when they
knew it was time

854
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:05,153
for her to get off
they would send,

855
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:07,155
it was mostly Chuckie.

856
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:10,656
They would send him down
to like kinda spy on her

857
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:12,162
to see where she went after work

858
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:12,171
to see where she went after work

859
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,662
or if she came
back to the house.

860
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:15,164
- (Narrator)
Fortunately for Gina,

861
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:17,665
her pregnancy ended
in a miscarriage

862
00:33:17,668 --> 00:33:19,668
and she was able to
reconcile with her mother

863
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,670
and move to Kentucky.

864
00:33:21,672 --> 00:33:23,173
Putting a couple of hundred
miles between herself

865
00:33:23,173 --> 00:33:23,182
Putting a couple of hundred
miles between herself

866
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:25,673
and the madness up in Findlay.

867
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:29,676
(Train whistle blowing)
(somber piano music)

868
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,687
- Vera loved that baby.

869
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:41,689
That was Vera's pride
and joy right there.

870
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:43,694
- She was the one that
was always babysittin'

871
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:43,702
- She was the one that
was always babysittin'

872
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,694
for Stacy's little girl.

873
00:33:46,697 --> 00:33:48,197
She always had her,

874
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:51,698
so I could see her
really being a mother

875
00:33:51,702 --> 00:33:53,203
to her own child.

876
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:53,212
To her own child.

877
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:54,203
- (Narrator) Except
Cheri was in charge

878
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:56,704
and she saw things different.

879
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:58,207
- Cheri had a lot of boys.

880
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,708
I think she was really,
really obsessed with girls,

881
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:01,711
especially since Maria

882
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:03,213
was taken away from her.

883
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:03,222
Was taken away from her.

884
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:05,713
- And I think, you
know, with Vera,

885
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,216
I mean she has a chance to,

886
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:09,217
you know, she has a
chance to take that one

887
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,218
rather easily.

888
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,722
- Cheri's always wanted
a baby girl again.

889
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:12,730
- Cheri's always wanted
a baby girl again.

890
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,723
She was gonna have
somebody make her a child,

891
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:19,227
another daughter, and
then she was gonna try

892
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:20,229
to take 'em away from her.

893
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,234
- Cheri said, "That's my
kid if you get a girl."

894
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:24,240
- Cheri said, "That's my
kid if you get a girl."

895
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,734
And she told Zachary
it better be a girl.

896
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:31,738
- She did tell Zachary
that if it turns out

897
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:36,747
to be a girl that she wanted
him to sign off his rights

898
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:36,752
to be a girl that she wanted
him to sign off his rights

899
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:38,247
to her and he did that.

900
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:40,749
He said that was fine.

901
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:43,253
- (Narrator) And this
was not just any womb

902
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:43,261
- (Narrator) And this
was not just any womb

903
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:46,253
chosen for the assignment
because Cheri once targeted

904
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:50,256
Vera herself to
replace her lost baby.

905
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,764
- Yeah, I was there
when she lost Maria.

906
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:53,770
- Yeah, I was there
when she lost Maria.

907
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,764
'Cause we lived on

908
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:58,266
Sandusky Street, a white
apartment house there

909
00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:02,773
and her and her ex-husband
Mike lived upstairs.

910
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:02,778
And her and her ex-husband
Mike lived upstairs.

911
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:04,273
- (Narrator) For five
months from the time

912
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:06,274
baby Vera was born in November

913
00:35:06,276 --> 00:35:08,776
until the sheriff took
baby Maria at Easter,

914
00:35:08,779 --> 00:35:11,779
the two little girls
lived in separate units

915
00:35:11,782 --> 00:35:13,784
of the exact same house.

916
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:13,792
Of the exact same house.

917
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,284
- She was trying to
take over on Vera

918
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:18,786
when Vera was a
baby and I told her,

919
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,289
"No, that's my baby."

920
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,793
- (Narrator) And so
remarkable, Cheri ended up

921
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:22,800
- (Narrator) And so
remarkable, Cheri ended up

922
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,293
taking the baby of the baby

923
00:35:24,294 --> 00:35:27,294
she tried to get
24 years earlier,

924
00:35:27,297 --> 00:35:31,797
claiming custody of baby Willadean before she was even born.

925
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:34,304
- Vera was like way out here.

926
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:34,312
- Vera was like way out here.

927
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:36,804
You would talk to Cheri
or you would see Cheri,

928
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:38,307
"My baby's in there.

929
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:39,308
"My baby.

930
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:40,809
"That's my baby, my baby."

931
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:43,313
You know, it's always "my baby."

932
00:35:43,313 --> 00:35:43,321
You know, it's always "my baby."

933
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:45,813
- They kept on tellin' Willadean
that Vera wasn't her mom,

934
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:47,816
that Cheri was her mom.

935
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:52,322
- And every time Willadean
wanted to come to her mom,

936
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:52,328
- And every time Willadean
wanted to come to her mom,

937
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:54,822
like her learning how to walk,

938
00:35:54,825 --> 00:35:57,825
she'd walk around and
she'd see her mommy

939
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:59,828
and she'd wanna run
up to her mommy,

940
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,332
and Vera would say, "No,
no, no, I'll get in trouble

941
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:02,340
and Vera would say, "No,
no, no, I'll get in trouble

942
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,332
"if I touch you."

943
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:06,334
- See, I seen Cheri
after Willadean was born,

944
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:08,336
maybe, I don't know, four
or five months later.

945
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:10,838
"You see my new baby?"

946
00:36:10,841 --> 00:36:11,841
I said, "Well, that's Vera's."

947
00:36:11,842 --> 00:36:12,843
"No, it's mine.

948
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:12,852
"No, it's mine.

949
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:14,343
"I adopted this baby."

950
00:36:15,846 --> 00:36:17,346
So it was no longer Vera's.

951
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:20,347
Vera could not do
anything with the baby.

952
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,353
She touched the
baby, Zach hit her.

953
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:23,360
She touched the
baby, Zach hit her.

954
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,853
That was Cheri's
baby, not Vera's.

955
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:28,357
- (Narrator) Another
example of Cheri's control

956
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:31,358
appears in the date
of the child's birth.

957
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:34,364
- Well, I'm November
3rd, she's November 4th.

958
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:34,371
- Well, I'm November
3rd, she's November 4th.

959
00:36:34,371 --> 00:36:36,864
- (Narrator) It is here
we glimpse the true depth

960
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:38,867
of Cheri's madness.

961
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:42,879
- She gave her castor
oil and orange juice.

962
00:36:43,874 --> 00:36:46,374
- To have the baby
come out earlier

963
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:48,376
than what it was supposed to be.

964
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:49,877
- (Narrator)
According to a website

965
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
for the castor oil industry,
the recommended dosage

966
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:54,885
for inducing labor with this
old midwifing technique,

967
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:54,892
for inducing labor with this
old midwifing technique,

968
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:56,385
is two tablespoons.

969
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:58,886
- Because she gave
her that castor oil,

970
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:01,389
gave Vera three bottles of it.

971
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:03,894
- And it was about
three bottles, yeah.

972
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:03,901
- And it was about
three bottles, yeah.

973
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:05,894
- To make her go into labor

974
00:37:05,896 --> 00:37:07,396
so she'd be there
for her birthday.

975
00:37:07,397 --> 00:37:09,897
- Well, it didn't
happen on her birthday.

976
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,402
It was the day after.

977
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:12,410
It was the day after.

978
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,402
'Cause she brags about that.

979
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:16,404
She said, "Well, we didn't
get it on my birthday,

980
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:17,906
"but it was close."

981
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:19,408
- So, she was an early
baby and she ended up

982
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:21,909
with having, in the
hospital for a while

983
00:37:21,912 --> 00:37:23,413
because she had heart problems.

984
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:23,422
Because she had heart problems.

985
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:25,913
- Supposedly her original
date was supposed to be

986
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:29,416
December 6, that she was
supposed to come out.

987
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,419
But she decided she
was comin' out to have

988
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:33,422
pumpkin pie and mashed potatoes

989
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:33,431
pumpkin pie and mashed potatoes

990
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:35,923
with Mawmaw for Thanksgiving.

991
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:38,426
So she come out early.

992
00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:42,933
'Cause she wanted to
meet her Mawmaw. (Laughs)

993
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:42,938
'Cause she wanted to
meet her Mawmaw. (Laughs)

994
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:45,933
(somber piano music)

995
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,943
- (Narrator) The secondary
motive was far more common.

996
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:52,950
- (Narrator) The secondary
motive was far more common.

997
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,943
- I don't think he really
wanted to be with her anymore.

998
00:37:56,947 --> 00:38:00,447
He wanted to be
with other people

999
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,960
but he couldn't because Cheri
wouldn't let Vera leave.

1000
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:08,956
- And he just said that they
needed to get rid of her

1001
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,959
and that he was seein'
some other girl.

1002
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:15,464
- Completely over.

1003
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:18,965
- She wanted Zachary because,
well, they had a baby together

1004
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,969
and she wanted
Zachary for herself.

1005
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:24,981
- Zachary, he would get really
mad of her being jealous

1006
00:38:26,476 --> 00:38:28,976
and go over the wall sometimes.

1007
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:31,479
- (Narrator) At first,
before she got beaten

1008
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:33,483
into submission, Vera
would fight back.

1009
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:33,491
Into submission, Vera
would fight back.

1010
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:36,983
- Vera sometimes
could be rebellious.

1011
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:39,989
She had a lot of anger.

1012
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,489
- Vera could cuss you.

1013
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:43,493
Vera could tear you up.

1014
00:38:43,493 --> 00:38:43,501
Vera could tear you up.

1015
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:45,493
- Zachary ain't allowed
to talk to a girl

1016
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:46,995
or look at 'em or anything.

1017
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:48,497
She was always mad.

1018
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:50,498
- (Narrator) And when
she got mad, he got mad.

1019
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,504
- He whipped a phone at
her face, like right here.

1020
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:54,510
- He whipped a phone at
her face, like right here.

1021
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,504
- Her eyebrow ring
came completely out.

1022
00:38:57,506 --> 00:39:00,007
- Like, meat was
hangin' out and stuff.

1023
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,010
- I raised my kids
not to hit a girl.

1024
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:05,015
But if they're gonna put
theirselves in a man's place

1025
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:05,022
But if they're gonna put
theirselves in a man's place

1026
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:07,015
then yeah, then do it.

1027
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,518
- (Narrator) In a normal
family the father would step in

1028
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,024
and stop this kind of abuse,
but not Kevin Brooks, Sr.

1029
00:39:14,024 --> 00:39:14,030
And stop this kind of abuse,
but not Kevin Brooks, Sr.

1030
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,524
- He's the opposite of Cheri.

1031
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:19,524
Where Cheri was loud and
up front and boisterous,

1032
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:22,532
Kevin was a background
person who liked to stay out

1033
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:22,539
Kevin was a background
person who liked to stay out

1034
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:24,532
of everything and
mind his own business.

1035
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:26,034
- (Narrator) Even when
minding his own business

1036
00:39:26,036 --> 00:39:28,536
meant letting Vera get beaten.

1037
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:30,538
- No, he's a arch coward.

1038
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,043
- And you think this
thing's happen in one day?

1039
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:33,050
- And you think this
thing's happen in one day?

1040
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,043
It's been going on for
moths and moths and months.

1041
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:37,545
- (Narrator) And when it became
clear that they were really

1042
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:41,047
going to kill her, Kevin
looked out for Kevin.

1043
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:42,552
- He already did his 30 days,

1044
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:42,561
- He already did his 30 days,

1045
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:45,552
but he had, at the time,
waiting for his 30 days

1046
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:48,055
to get in lock-up, he was like,
"If you're goin' to kill her

1047
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:51,058
"wait 'til I'm in jail so
that way I have an alibi."

1048
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:52,562
Those were his exact words.

1049
00:39:52,562 --> 00:39:52,571
Those were his exact words.

1050
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:54,062
- (Narrator) Crazy as it sounds,

1051
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:57,564
if Vera was going to be saved
it would have to have been

1052
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,067
one of the Brooks boys.

1053
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:00,569
- That was Punky.

1054
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,573
He was the one that was
killed in an accident.

1055
00:40:03,573 --> 00:40:03,580
He was the one that was
killed in an accident.

1056
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,073
- (Narrator)
Unfortunately, the only one

1057
00:40:05,075 --> 00:40:09,575
with enough balls to stand
up to Cheri was already dead.

1058
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:10,079
- He ran that household.

1059
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,083
Punky ran that household.

1060
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:13,090
Punky ran that household.

1061
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,582
His dad and mom were
both afraid of him.

1062
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:19,586
- (Narrator) On July 3rd the
summer before Vera's murder,

1063
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:21,589
Punky was walking
with his girlfriend

1064
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,593
on a dark, rural highway.

1065
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:23,601
On a dark, rural highway.

1066
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:25,093
- They were heading
towards their town

1067
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:27,095
to go see the fireworks.

1068
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:29,597
- That's not what I was told.

1069
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,099
- That's what Cheri told me,
he was goin' for the fireworks.

1070
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:33,603
But yeah, I know he was goin'

1071
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:33,612
But yeah, I know he was goin'

1072
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:35,103
for a drug thing.
- He was goin' to get

1073
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:36,105
Heather's heroin.

1074
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:40,607
- You know, cab drivin' by
couldn't see him, then bang!

1075
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,614
- She was really crazy
because of him dyin'

1076
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:44,620
- She was really crazy
because of him dyin'

1077
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,114
and the ashes are still at
the house and everything

1078
00:40:48,118 --> 00:40:49,618
and she won't bury him.

1079
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,622
- My son's layin' up
there on the bottom shelf

1080
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:52,629
- My son's layin' up
there on the bottom shelf

1081
00:40:52,629 --> 00:40:53,622
in that box.

1082
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,125
- It seems like
she'd gotten worse.

1083
00:40:57,127 --> 00:40:59,127
I mean, it's just
like Cheri went crazy.

1084
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:02,129
- I mean, you talk about
Punky, Punky is like wow,

1085
00:41:02,132 --> 00:41:06,136
Punky you know, all the
girls went wild for Punky.

1086
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:06,142
Punky you know, all the
girls went wild for Punky.

1087
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:07,636
- (Narrator) From
the night he was hit

1088
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:10,637
Cheri could not accept her
son's death was an accident.

1089
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,642
Now she was out for revenge.

1090
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:12,650
Now she was out for revenge.

1091
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,142
- The accident happened
20 minutes before

1092
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:19,148
they got any call

1093
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:22,652
and Cheri was all mad about that

1094
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:22,661
and Cheri was all mad about that

1095
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:24,152
and then was tryin' to
put the blame on Heather

1096
00:41:24,154 --> 00:41:26,654
sayin' that Heather
pushed Punky.

1097
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:30,156
- Cheri had told Heather, you
know, "I just want the truth.

1098
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,660
"Did you push him?"

1099
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:36,163
And Heather looked at her and
said, "No, I did not do it."

1100
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:38,166
- (Narrator) But when it
comes to Cheri's fantasies,

1101
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:41,168
what actually happened
doesn't really matter.

1102
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:45,181
- Heather pushed Punky in
front of the Accurate cab

1103
00:41:48,678 --> 00:41:51,178
to help kill my son that night.

1104
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:56,683
- Cheri said that Heather is
the one that killed Punky,

1105
00:41:56,686 --> 00:41:58,686
had it set up so that's
why Cheri had Marsi

1106
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:00,188
beat Heather up for it.

1107
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,195
- Marsi was, I believe she
was standing on the porch.

1108
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:05,200
- Marsi was, I believe she
was standing on the porch.

1109
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,695
She was like standing by Cheri.

1110
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:09,696
Cheri had whispered to
her, she said, "I need you

1111
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:11,199
"to do me a favor."

1112
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:12,702
- That went down crazy.

1113
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:12,711
- That went down crazy.

1114
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:15,202
- Then outta nowhere
Marsi just takes her hand

1115
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:16,705
and starts punchin'
her in the face.

1116
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:18,706
- Then took her by
the head of the hair

1117
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,708
and rolled her down the steps

1118
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,712
and started beaten
the hell out of her.

1119
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:22,720
And started beaten
the hell out of her.

1120
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,211
- They were like,
"Bring her to the road.

1121
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:26,214
"Curb stomp her."

1122
00:42:26,216 --> 00:42:28,216
- And at that time
Heather's nose

1123
00:42:28,218 --> 00:42:30,218
was like bleeding really bad

1124
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,720
and you could see
that it was broken.

1125
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:33,223
- All she kept sayin' is,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"

1126
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:33,231
- All she kept sayin' is,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"

1127
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:35,223
and she kept puttin'
her hands up in the air

1128
00:42:35,225 --> 00:42:38,225
and Zachary said, "This
is fucked up." (Chuckles)

1129
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:41,228
- Then Marsi told her, you
know, that'll teach you

1130
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:43,233
to ever mess with
my family again.

1131
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:43,241
To ever mess with
my family again.

1132
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:46,233
- Because you killed Punky.

1133
00:42:46,236 --> 00:42:50,736
You had Punky killed and
you took the best thing

1134
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,250
away from us all when
you had Punky killed.

1135
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:57,245
- (Narrator) Like his brother
Zach as well as Danny Bixler,

1136
00:42:57,247 --> 00:43:00,747
Punky was a member of
the Crips street gang.

1137
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,254
- Punky was supposably
a Crip, and Zachary.

1138
00:43:04,254 --> 00:43:04,259
- Punky was supposably
a Crip, and Zachary.

1139
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:08,254
- Punky says that he wanted
to get Zach to take his place.

1140
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:10,758
To be able to fight like he does

1141
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,260
and they wanna run this town.

1142
00:43:12,262 --> 00:43:14,764
- (Narrator) It was then
that Cheri and Zachary

1143
00:43:14,764 --> 00:43:14,772
- (Narrator) It was then
that Cheri and Zachary

1144
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:17,264
really turned on Vera.

1145
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:20,267
- At times I live with them
and everything else, you know.

1146
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,770
They were gettin'
along great, you know.

1147
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:25,275
"Love you," kisses
and everything else

1148
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:25,281
"Love you," kisses
and everything else

1149
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:26,775
and then all of a
sudden Punky dies,

1150
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:29,776
it's, you know, "I
wanna beat her."

1151
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:31,779
- (Narrator) The pattern
began to take shape.

1152
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:33,791
- There was a candy bar

1153
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:37,785
in the room where they had

1154
00:43:37,787 --> 00:43:40,287
Punky's little memorial thing.

1155
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,793
- I know (mumbles),
he and Punky,

1156
00:43:43,793 --> 00:43:43,800
- I know (mumbles),
he and Punky,

1157
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,793
they were really tight together.

1158
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:49,295
- I guess the candy bar
was supposably for Punky

1159
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:53,803
and Vera ended up eatin'
it because she was hungry

1160
00:43:53,803 --> 00:43:53,809
and Vera ended up eatin'
it because she was hungry

1161
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:55,803
and they told her she
couldn't get out of the room.

1162
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:59,304
- And Alyssa went off on
her and she actually had her

1163
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:01,808
on the ground and she punched
her, like, maybe twice.

1164
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:03,813
- (Narrator) This game
of trumping up a charge

1165
00:44:03,813 --> 00:44:03,821
- (Narrator) This game
of trumping up a charge

1166
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:05,813
to get someone else to beat Vera

1167
00:44:05,815 --> 00:44:08,815
was not an isolated incident.

1168
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:11,318
- He was thinkin' of people
who could beat the crap

1169
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:15,325
out of Vera badly, so
he just got on his phone

1170
00:44:15,325 --> 00:44:15,331
out of Vera badly, so
he just got on his phone

1171
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:18,325
and he started callin'
people or textin' people

1172
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:20,828
and as soon as they got the
word they came rushin' over.

1173
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,832
- (Narrator) Zachary
Brooks, tough new leader

1174
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:22,840
- (Narrator) Zachary
Brooks, tough new leader

1175
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,832
of the Findlay Crips, was
texting his dead brother's

1176
00:44:25,835 --> 00:44:28,335
old girlfriends to
come over and assault

1177
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:30,338
his defenseless baby mama.

1178
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,842
- Crystal pushes her
down on the floor

1179
00:44:32,842 --> 00:44:32,850
- Crystal pushes her
down on the floor

1180
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,842
and Zachary's yellin' at her,
"Come on, hit her, hit her."

1181
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:38,345
- (Narrator) And they do it.

1182
00:44:38,348 --> 00:44:40,848
(Bell dinging)

1183
00:44:42,352 --> 00:44:44,854
(train whistle blows)

1184
00:44:44,854 --> 00:44:44,862
(train whistle blows)

1185
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:48,854
The location was chosen
for a very personal reason.

1186
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:51,358
- They tried to do the same
identical thing to Vera

1187
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:52,862
that happened to Travis.

1188
00:44:52,862 --> 00:44:52,871
That happened to Travis.

1189
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:54,362
Take her to the railroad tracks

1190
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:55,864
and lay her out for the--
- Exactly.

1191
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:59,365
- Train to run over her and
cut her head open and you know.

1192
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:01,369
- (Narrator) Travis
Puckett was the son

1193
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,373
of Cheri's baby sister Tabitha.

1194
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:03,381
Of Cheri's baby sister Tabitha.

1195
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:05,873
- My nephew Travis
was 16 years old

1196
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:09,875
and my sister told him to get
the hell out of her house.

1197
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:12,882
- (Narrator) The
same age as Zachary,

1198
00:45:12,882 --> 00:45:12,891
- (Narrator) The
same age as Zachary,

1199
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:15,382
Travis became part of
the Brooks boys gang,

1200
00:45:15,385 --> 00:45:19,385
hanging out at a local
park riding skateboards.

1201
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:21,389
- He went takin'
off down the road

1202
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:24,894
and that's when he jumped
the railroad tracks.

1203
00:45:24,894 --> 00:45:24,901
And that's when he jumped
the railroad tracks.

1204
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:27,894
- 'Cause it was two trains
comin' at the same time,

1205
00:45:27,897 --> 00:45:29,897
so he couldn't do nothin'.

1206
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:33,403
- And went Travis went to
jump, Travis slipped under

1207
00:45:33,403 --> 00:45:33,409
- And went Travis went to
jump, Travis slipped under

1208
00:45:33,409 --> 00:45:35,403
and (hands smack) and
off came Travis's head.

1209
00:45:35,405 --> 00:45:39,405
- He looked back like this
to see his brother Curtis

1210
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:40,909
and when he did

1211
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,413
the other train came
and that's when he got,

1212
00:45:43,413 --> 00:45:43,420
the other train came
and that's when he got,

1213
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,413
she says like hamburger.

1214
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:49,917
- And then he was smashed
up like hamburger.

1215
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:51,919
- (Narrator) But
what's important is not

1216
00:45:51,921 --> 00:45:53,923
whether Cheri and Zachary
consciously wanted

1217
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:53,931
whether Cheri and Zachary
consciously wanted

1218
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:56,923
to imitate Travis's
death, it's that they told

1219
00:45:56,926 --> 00:46:00,426
the killers about their
vendetta against Vera.

1220
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,930
- I think she was
thinkin' about it

1221
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:05,940
when Vera accidentally
dropped a brick on her foot.

1222
00:46:08,438 --> 00:46:10,938
- I asked her to come
outside with me and help me

1223
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,444
clean the rabbit
cage and I had a tarp

1224
00:46:14,444 --> 00:46:14,450
clean the rabbit
cage and I had a tarp

1225
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:15,944
on top of the rabbit cage.

1226
00:46:15,945 --> 00:46:19,945
- And there was like four
bricks to keep the tarp on there

1227
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:22,449
so that way it
doesn't blow away.

1228
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:25,955
- (Nicole) She told me also
that Vera had thrown rocks,

1229
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:25,962
- (Nicole) She told me also
that Vera had thrown rocks,

1230
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:28,955
big huge like
rocks onto her feet

1231
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,458
and that's why her
feet had to be wrapped.

1232
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:34,464
- Zachary come runnin' outside

1233
00:46:34,464 --> 00:46:34,471
- Zachary come runnin' outside

1234
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:36,464
and he said,
"What's wrong, Mom?"

1235
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:40,966
I said, "Bitch fuckin'
dropped that rock on my foot.

1236
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,470
"I need help."

1237
00:46:42,472 --> 00:46:43,973
He said, "What?"

1238
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:43,982
He said, "What?"

1239
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:46,473
I said, "She fuckin'
threw that rock on my foot

1240
00:46:46,476 --> 00:46:47,476
"and it hurts.

1241
00:46:47,477 --> 00:46:48,477
"Get it off."

1242
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:51,478
- Zachary and all
them, they're sayin'

1243
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:54,984
that she intentionally did it.

1244
00:46:54,984 --> 00:46:54,991
That she intentionally did it.

1245
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:56,984
- And I yelled at her,
said, "You fuckin' bitch!"

1246
00:46:56,986 --> 00:46:58,986
I said, "You fuckin' hit
me with a fuckin' rock,

1247
00:46:58,988 --> 00:47:00,488
"you fuckin' bitch."

1248
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,490
- (Narrator) The
slave had committed

1249
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:03,502
a fatal error.

1250
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:08,995
- Nope, she didn't apologize.

1251
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:10,498
She never apologizes.

1252
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:16,005
- (Narrator) From this point
on things went downhill.

1253
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:16,011
- (Narrator) From this point
on things went downhill.

1254
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:19,005
- It all happened,
events after that.

1255
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:22,508
After she got the
bricks, was on her foot.

1256
00:47:22,512 --> 00:47:26,015
- The rock hit on
Cheri's foot and then

1257
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:26,022
- The rock hit on
Cheri's foot and then

1258
00:47:26,022 --> 00:47:27,515
that's when they
were going to plan

1259
00:47:27,517 --> 00:47:30,017
on throwing Vera on the tracks.

1260
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:33,529
(Train whistle blowing)

1261
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:40,525
- Cheri made a little joke
about wanting to drug Vera

1262
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:47,033
with her sleeping pills and
Zachary wanted to get her high

1263
00:47:47,036 --> 00:47:50,036
and everything and
then mix those together

1264
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:52,039
and then let her walk
the tracks at nighttime.

1265
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:55,044
Eventually she would
fall over and lay right

1266
00:47:55,044 --> 00:47:55,051
Eventually she would
fall over and lay right

1267
00:47:55,051 --> 00:47:57,544
in the middle of the tracks.

1268
00:47:57,547 --> 00:47:59,047
- When she said you
need to cut her up

1269
00:47:59,048 --> 00:48:02,048
and put her on the tracks,
then she looked towards Vera,

1270
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:04,053
smiled, and turned back.

1271
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:04,061
Smiled, and turned back.

1272
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:08,053
- And there would be
no way of the conductor

1273
00:48:08,057 --> 00:48:10,057
to stop the train in time.

1274
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:14,063
- She thought if she did
get squished by the train

1275
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:14,071
- She thought if she did
get squished by the train

1276
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:16,563
then there wouldn't
be any fingerprints

1277
00:48:16,566 --> 00:48:18,566
because you would be
like hamburger meat.

1278
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:20,568
- So basically she
wanted to kill her.

1279
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:24,080
(Train whistle blowing)

1280
00:48:26,576 --> 00:48:29,076
(somber music)

1281
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:32,080
- (Narrator) On
Sunday March 20th,

1282
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:35,585
Danny and Nicole ran from
the assault charge in Tiffin

1283
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:35,591
Danny and Nicole ran from
the assault charge in Tiffin

1284
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:37,585
and arrived at the Brooks house.

1285
00:48:37,587 --> 00:48:40,587
That evening they met
a being named Vera who,

1286
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:43,092
already living in a
perpetual state of terror,

1287
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:43,100
already living in a
perpetual state of terror,

1288
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,092
could no longer be
considered human.

1289
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:49,095
- She stayed in her room 24/7.

1290
00:48:49,098 --> 00:48:53,102
She barely ever came out
unless Cheri called her.

1291
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:53,108
She barely ever came out
unless Cheri called her.

1292
00:48:53,108 --> 00:48:55,602
- She was basically like this.

1293
00:48:55,605 --> 00:48:58,105
Wouldn't look you in the eye.

1294
00:48:58,107 --> 00:48:59,607
Wouldn't talk.

1295
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:01,109
If somebody walked in the house,

1296
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,613
she'd go to the
bedroom by herself.

1297
00:49:03,613 --> 00:49:03,620
She'd go to the
bedroom by herself.

1298
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,113
- If she's sitting there
and just curled up like this

1299
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:08,116
and looking up like
this every now and then

1300
00:49:08,117 --> 00:49:09,617
and then going
back down, I mean,

1301
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,619
you get this idea
that she was probably

1302
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,124
pretty much psychically
dead anyway.

1303
00:49:15,124 --> 00:49:15,131
Pretty much psychically
dead anyway.

1304
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:17,124
- (Narrator) Meanwhile,
Vera's baby daddy

1305
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:19,126
had found a kindred
spirit bonding

1306
00:49:19,128 --> 00:49:21,628
with his long lost Crip brother.

1307
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,633
- They seemed very
dependent on each other.

1308
00:49:26,636 --> 00:49:30,636
They seemed very close for
just knowing each other

1309
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,142
for that little of time.

1310
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:33,150
For that little of time.

1311
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,142
- (Narrator) For
the next four days,

1312
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:37,643
they unleashed an animalistic
rage that is hard,

1313
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:40,647
but not impossible, to explain.

1314
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,653
- Cheri Brooks and
the entire family

1315
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:43,660
- Cheri Brooks and
the entire family

1316
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,653
was telling Danny stories.

1317
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:48,656
- (Narrator) For the past
three years he lived here

1318
00:49:48,658 --> 00:49:50,658
at Allen Correctional.

1319
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,660
- Guys who in prison
had been raped

1320
00:49:52,662 --> 00:49:57,166
when they come out it's
like they wanna get revenge

1321
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:57,172
when they come out it's
like they wanna get revenge

1322
00:49:57,172 --> 00:49:58,666
on somebody.

1323
00:49:58,668 --> 00:50:00,668
- (Narrator) And gang
bangers and their bloody code

1324
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,673
of survival is very, very real.

1325
00:50:03,673 --> 00:50:03,680
Of survival is very, very real.

1326
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,673
- Well, I know she's
all about the Crip stuff

1327
00:50:05,675 --> 00:50:07,175
because when we were at
dinner she was talkin'

1328
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:09,176
all about Punky bein' a Crip.

1329
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:12,678
And she had a blue bandana
around his flowers.

1330
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:14,183
- (Man) Do you think
Cheri thinks she's a Crip?

1331
00:50:14,183 --> 00:50:14,192
- (Man) Do you think
Cheri thinks she's a Crip?

1332
00:50:14,192 --> 00:50:16,183
- Yeah, for sure.

1333
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:17,685
- (Man) So, as far as
this gang affiliation,

1334
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:21,187
who's the first Crip
amongst the Brookses?

1335
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,690
- Punky.

1336
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:24,694
- (Narrator) This is
why when interviewed

1337
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:24,702
- (Narrator) This is
why when interviewed

1338
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:27,694
for this project, Danny's
response was so chilling.

1339
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:30,197
- When he mentioned
something about Punky,

1340
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:32,699
they all get this thing of

1341
00:50:36,205 --> 00:50:39,705
thinkin' that she's
disrespectful to Punky.

1342
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:41,709
- (Narrator) But she was
being accused of more

1343
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:43,713
than just disrespecting Punky.

1344
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:43,721
Than just disrespecting Punky.

1345
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:46,213
Zachary and Cheri told
Danny, who was in prison

1346
00:50:46,215 --> 00:50:49,715
when it happened, that
she had murdered him.

1347
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:52,719
In their most
vicious lie of all,

1348
00:50:52,722 --> 00:50:55,224
knowing full well
how he would react,

1349
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:55,232
knowing full well
how he would react,

1350
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:58,224
they convinced Danny it
was Vera who pushed Punky

1351
00:50:58,227 --> 00:50:59,727
in front of the cab.

1352
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:02,730
- Oh my God.

1353
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,733
- No, but that

1354
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:08,235
is just messed up
just to tell anybody

1355
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:13,743
Vera was the one to push
Punky because there was a lot

1356
00:51:13,743 --> 00:51:13,749
Vera was the one to push
Punky because there was a lot

1357
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:16,243
of people that would
take up for Punky.

1358
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:18,245
- (Narrator) So not
only was Vera a threat

1359
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:20,247
to Cheri's precious
baby, Willadean, she also

1360
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:23,252
killed the Brooks gang's leader.

1361
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:23,259
Killed the Brooks gang's leader.

1362
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:25,752
Now Cheri wanted
something done about it.

1363
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:28,755
- Nicole was just another
opportunity for her

1364
00:51:28,758 --> 00:51:31,258
to do her mind games with.

1365
00:51:32,762 --> 00:51:33,763
- She wants to be a
people pleaser so bad.

1366
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:33,772
- She wants to be a
people pleaser so bad.

1367
00:51:33,772 --> 00:51:36,763
She wants friends so
bad that she just,

1368
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:38,766
she couldn't see
it comin' at all.

1369
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:41,267
Especially not with someone
as conniving as Cheri is.

1370
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,773
- From what she
either says or does,

1371
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:43,780
- From what she
either says or does,

1372
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:48,773
everybody else follows and
just does what they're told.

1373
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:51,278
- It was like the
female Charlie Manson.

1374
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,783
Like if Charlie Manson had
a girl form it would be her.

1375
00:51:53,783 --> 00:51:53,790
Like if Charlie Manson had
a girl form it would be her.

1376
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,283
- Cheri is the one
that told him to do it.

1377
00:51:57,286 --> 00:51:58,786
He did say that.

1378
00:51:58,788 --> 00:52:01,288
- Since she knew
Danny was in the Crips

1379
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,793
and she believes
that she is a Crip,

1380
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:03,800
and she believes
that she is a Crip,

1381
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,793
she pretty much put
into Danny's mind,

1382
00:52:07,797 --> 00:52:09,797
like, hey, help us out.

1383
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:12,799
- (Narrator) Then Cheri's
little helpers got busy.

1384
00:52:12,802 --> 00:52:15,304
- Chuckie's pad lock
from his school locker

1385
00:52:15,304 --> 00:52:15,312
- Chuckie's pad lock
from his school locker

1386
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:18,304
was sitting on the stand
and they just happened

1387
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:21,806
to pick it up and
hook it to the belt

1388
00:52:21,811 --> 00:52:23,813
and all of a sudden
that's when they started

1389
00:52:23,813 --> 00:52:23,821
and all of a sudden
that's when they started

1390
00:52:23,821 --> 00:52:25,813
hittin' Vera in the head
and the body with it.

1391
00:52:25,815 --> 00:52:28,315
- It was their weapon
of choice after that.

1392
00:52:28,317 --> 00:52:32,317
That and a big long paddle
with a number 3 on it.

1393
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:37,323
- Nicole took the paddle
and beat Vera's ass

1394
00:52:37,326 --> 00:52:39,826
and Vera had a
bruise on her ass.

1395
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:41,329
And all Vera had
on was a t-shrit

1396
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,332
and her underwear.

1397
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:43,340
And her underwear.

1398
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,832
- (Narrator) And the
more Vera screamed,

1399
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:47,334
the more it became sexual.

1400
00:52:47,336 --> 00:52:51,836
- I think Nicole gets
off of a lot of violence.

1401
00:52:51,841 --> 00:52:55,344
- And Nicky was like, like
she was gettin' real excited

1402
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:55,351
- And Nicky was like, like
she was gettin' real excited

1403
00:52:55,351 --> 00:52:58,844
and then she'd go over
and start kissin' on Danny

1404
00:52:58,848 --> 00:53:00,848
like she was bein' turned
on for what she was doin'.

1405
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:04,353
- I think once Danny
started beatin' her,

1406
00:53:04,353 --> 00:53:04,360
- I think once Danny
started beatin' her,

1407
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,853
he couldn't stop.

1408
00:53:06,856 --> 00:53:08,856
He got off on it.

1409
00:53:08,858 --> 00:53:11,858
Basically he says, now
this is gettin' fun.

1410
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:14,363
- When she got hit her
hand went up like this

1411
00:53:14,363 --> 00:53:14,371
- When she got hit her
hand went up like this

1412
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:17,863
and it accidentally
hit Nicole's boob

1413
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:21,869
and Nicole said, oh,
(hands smack) bam,

1414
00:53:21,871 --> 00:53:23,372
right across the face.

1415
00:53:23,372 --> 00:53:23,381
Right across the face.

1416
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:24,872
Now you're doin' a
lesbian act on me?

1417
00:53:24,874 --> 00:53:28,874
- After the beatings
Vera, they would run up

1418
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:31,378
to the room where
they were sleeping at

1419
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,879
to pretty much get it on.

1420
00:53:32,882 --> 00:53:35,383
- The idea that after
they had beaten Vera

1421
00:53:35,383 --> 00:53:35,392
- The idea that after
they had beaten Vera

1422
00:53:35,392 --> 00:53:36,884
they would go
upstairs and have sex

1423
00:53:36,886 --> 00:53:38,886
would also indicate
that there was

1424
00:53:38,888 --> 00:53:42,388
some sort of real psychological
thrill about this.

1425
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:43,893
- I don't know if you
know, but almost every bone

1426
00:53:43,893 --> 00:53:43,901
- I don't know if you
know, but almost every bone

1427
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:45,893
in her face was broke.

1428
00:53:45,895 --> 00:53:48,895
A lot of that's from being
slugged for lookin' at Danny.

1429
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:53,903
- Nicole punched Vera right
square in the nose like this.

1430
00:53:53,903 --> 00:53:53,908
- Nicole punched Vera right
square in the nose like this.

1431
00:53:53,908 --> 00:53:56,403
- Vera was not even
interested in Danny.

1432
00:53:56,405 --> 00:53:58,905
That was all brought up
because Cheri kept sayin',

1433
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:01,408
"Yeah, Vera will
sleep with any of 'em.

1434
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,910
"She slept with all my sons.

1435
00:54:02,912 --> 00:54:04,913
"She'll sleep with Danny, too."

1436
00:54:04,913 --> 00:54:04,922
"She'll sleep with Danny, too."

1437
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:07,914
- And then as soon as
they would beat on her,

1438
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:10,417
they'd run right
upstairs and have sex

1439
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:12,919
and then come right back
down and beat on Vera again

1440
00:54:12,922 --> 00:54:15,424
like it turned 'em on.

1441
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:15,432
Like it turned 'em on.

1442
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:16,424
- (Narrator) By this
admission, when you consider

1443
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:19,925
whose bedroom was
downstairs, Danny and Nicole

1444
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:23,432
were not the only ones
getting off on it.

1445
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:23,439
Were not the only ones
getting off on it.

1446
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:24,932
- It always happens
in Mother's room

1447
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:26,434
for some reason.

1448
00:54:26,435 --> 00:54:26,935
- (Interviewer) All
the beatings were in

1449
00:54:26,936 --> 00:54:28,936
your Mom's room?
- Yes.

1450
00:54:28,938 --> 00:54:30,438
- Cheri just spoke out.

1451
00:54:30,439 --> 00:54:31,939
She just said, "Hit her again."

1452
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:35,945
- She thinks it's cute of Vera
havin' black eyes and stuff,

1453
00:54:35,945 --> 00:54:35,951
- She thinks it's cute of Vera
havin' black eyes and stuff,

1454
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:37,445
said she looks like
a little squirrel.

1455
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:40,446
- Like, she wants everybody
to know that she wanted her

1456
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:41,949
to be hit.

1457
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:44,954
- She kept hittin'
her head like this

1458
00:54:44,954 --> 00:54:44,961
- She kept hittin'
her head like this

1459
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:48,954
on the dresser and Nicky
kept sayin', "Can I kill her?

1460
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:50,458
"Can I kill her?

1461
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:51,959
"Can I kill her?

1462
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:53,462
- (Narrator) And through it
all, to quote Danny Bixler,

1463
00:54:53,462 --> 00:54:53,471
- (Narrator) And through it
all, to quote Danny Bixler,

1464
00:54:53,471 --> 00:54:54,962
Vera just took it.

1465
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:59,965
- That's when he pretty
much mud stomped.

1466
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:01,469
It's a southern term.

1467
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,472
It's where when they're on
the ground you just stomp 'em

1468
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:03,480
It's where when they're on
the ground you just stomp 'em

1469
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,972
until they're
pretty much weakened

1470
00:55:05,975 --> 00:55:08,475
to where they can't
even get up again.

1471
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:10,977
- When somebody gets
beat up in prison

1472
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,980
they call it that way.

1473
00:55:12,982 --> 00:55:14,483
- (Narrator) Her injuries
from the mud stomping

1474
00:55:14,483 --> 00:55:14,491
- (Narrator) Her injuries
from the mud stomping

1475
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:16,483
were all too evident
the following day

1476
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:19,485
when, amazingly, they took
a break from beating Vera

1477
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:21,988
and walked her across
the street to lunch.

1478
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:26,495
- Somebody else actually
told us what she wanted.

1479
00:55:26,495 --> 00:55:26,501
- Somebody else actually
told us what she wanted.

1480
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:28,495
It looked like her
lip had been busted

1481
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:29,497
right here.

1482
00:55:29,498 --> 00:55:31,498
- We talked about it
after we were done.

1483
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,502
After they had left we all
says, "Man, did you see

1484
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:33,510
After they had left we all
says, "Man, did you see

1485
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,002
"that girl's face?"

1486
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:39,004
- I'd made the comment
to Shane and a couple

1487
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:41,008
of other people, I said, "Man,

1488
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:44,013
"she looks like she went through
the windshield of a car."

1489
00:55:44,013 --> 00:55:44,020
"She looks like she went through
the windshield of a car."

1490
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,513
(Dramatic music)

1491
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:12,539
- (Narrator) As it became
clear the legal system

1492
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:14,043
was going to
minimize the enormity

1493
00:56:14,043 --> 00:56:14,051
was going to
minimize the enormity

1494
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,543
of what had happened to
Vera, frustration grew

1495
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:19,046
throughout the community.

1496
00:56:19,048 --> 00:56:22,548
This led to the formation
of Voices for Vera,

1497
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:25,554
an activist group dedicated
to bringing the people

1498
00:56:25,554 --> 00:56:25,561
an activist group dedicated
to bringing the people

1499
00:56:25,561 --> 00:56:28,554
who brutalized her to justice.

1500
00:56:28,557 --> 00:56:29,557
- We don't understand.

1501
00:56:29,558 --> 00:56:31,558
We don't know why that
there was only two people

1502
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,563
that was charged
with this murder.

1503
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,063
There was so many
people involved,

1504
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:39,065
and there's only two people
that's bein' charged with it.

1505
00:56:39,068 --> 00:56:41,568
Except for lying to the police.

1506
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,070
Wow.

1507
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:45,074
- (Narrator) Nor did anyone
in the prosecutor's office

1508
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:47,074
figure out the
author of these lies,

1509
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:49,576
evidenced by how the
judge sentenced Cheri

1510
00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:52,078
for passing on
secondhand information

1511
00:56:52,081 --> 00:56:54,083
that she herself had created.

1512
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:58,083
- Mrs. Brooks has a relatively
long criminal history,

1513
00:56:58,087 --> 00:56:59,087
mostly minor offenses,

1514
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:01,588
those of a minor
nature, but at least one

1515
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:05,094
felony offense,
albeit some years ago.

1516
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,094
With respect to Ms. Brooks
involvement in this particular

1517
00:57:08,097 --> 00:57:12,097
case it appears that
Ms. Brooks participation

1518
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:14,103
is slightly, and I
underscore slightly,

1519
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:17,103
less serious than that of the
others who've been involved

1520
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:20,606
because it appears that her
crime involves the passing

1521
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:24,613
along of secondhand
information, which nonetheless

1522
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:26,613
misled the officers,
but it appears to be

1523
00:57:26,615 --> 00:57:30,115
more of a secondhand information
that she passed along

1524
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:32,619
as opposed to
firsthand information.

1525
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,122
- (Narrator) Not only
was the court fooled

1526
00:57:34,131 --> 00:57:37,123
about Cheri's role in
making it the cover story,

1527
00:57:37,126 --> 00:57:38,626
no one even bothered
to determine

1528
00:57:38,627 --> 00:57:41,627
when she told her
family to say it.

1529
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:45,633
- Yes.

1530
00:57:48,637 --> 00:57:50,637
- When Vera was sleeping

1531
00:57:52,141 --> 00:57:56,145
from her bruises, 'cause
I had to actually do

1532
00:57:56,151 --> 00:57:58,145
her dang feet that night.

1533
00:57:59,648 --> 00:58:01,148
- Yeah, there was one
night I had to do her feet

1534
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,653
because Vera was too wounded to.

1535
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,653
- (Narrator) Scottie is
talking about Thursday

1536
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:09,155
following Vera's mud stomping.

1537
00:58:09,158 --> 00:58:12,158
- I believe yes, I believe he
did do her feet that night.

1538
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:15,664
- And that's when she said
if they would kill her,

1539
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:17,664
"I hope they don't."

1540
00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:19,666
Like, you know, throwing it off.

1541
00:58:19,668 --> 00:58:22,168
That we would have
to have a cover story

1542
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:24,181
to protect this family.

1543
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:32,178
- They had to think of
something and put blame

1544
00:58:32,181 --> 00:58:36,685
on certain people to still
try to keep certain members

1545
00:58:36,691 --> 00:58:38,685
of the family out of it.

1546
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,693
- The secondhand
information means

1547
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,693
that Shannon told me
that they took Vera

1548
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:52,697
up to the tracks and that
they degutted her like a fish

1549
00:58:54,203 --> 00:58:57,203
and that they left
her up there to die.

1550
00:58:58,206 --> 00:58:59,707
And Shannon said,
"Don't worry about it

1551
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,708
"because she deserved it."

1552
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,712
- It's like this.

1553
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,212
You're looking at this
hand while something else

1554
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:06,714
is going on in this hand.

1555
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:09,715
But you're pretty much more
interested in this hand.

1556
00:59:09,718 --> 00:59:12,718
- That's probably
what was in her head,

1557
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:14,723
was to take Willadean
away from Vera,

1558
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:17,723
get Vera out of
the picture so that

1559
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:22,728
she could have Willadean
as her own child

1560
00:59:23,732 --> 00:59:25,232
and have her raise it

1561
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:29,235
as hers and Michael's

1562
00:59:29,238 --> 00:59:31,238
and it's not her child.

1563
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:36,745
I mean, there's nothin' wrong
helpin' Vera with the child,

1564
00:59:36,751 --> 00:59:38,745
givin' it baths,
helpin' her feed her

1565
00:59:38,747 --> 00:59:40,747
and helpin' her change her,

1566
00:59:40,749 --> 00:59:43,249
you know, taking care
of her, but she didn't

1567
00:59:43,252 --> 00:59:46,255
have to kill Vera,
have Vera killed

1568
00:59:46,262 --> 00:59:48,255
just to take her baby from her.

1569
00:59:48,257 --> 00:59:50,256
- (Narrator) Yet,
incredible as it sounds,

1570
00:59:50,259 --> 00:59:53,762
this absurd projection
of Cheri's own motive

1571
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:56,762
became the basis of the
state of Ohio's case

1572
00:59:56,765 --> 00:59:58,765
against Vera's killers.

1573
00:59:58,767 --> 01:00:01,767
- The official
version of events,

1574
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,270
Danny Bixler
indicated he was upset

1575
01:00:03,272 --> 01:00:05,274
with Vera Jo for spraying

1576
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:07,774
pepper spray in the home.

1577
01:00:07,776 --> 01:00:09,776
- Not that Shannon
had no involvement

1578
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:12,778
in Vera's murder, she did.

1579
01:00:12,781 --> 01:00:17,286
- (Nicole) It's not only
Cheri that was manipulative.

1580
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:20,786
Shannon Brooks, Michael
Brooks's wife, also

1581
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,792
said that she was
three months pregnant.

1582
01:00:23,801 --> 01:00:25,292
She was never pregnant.

1583
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:28,794
- Cheri, I guess,
while I was gone

1584
01:00:28,797 --> 01:00:31,797
had told Danny
and Nicole that...

1585
01:00:35,804 --> 01:00:37,304
I had miscarried.

1586
01:00:38,307 --> 01:00:40,807
I never told her
that I was pregnant.

1587
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:44,313
Not one bit did I say
that I was pregnant.

1588
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,313
- (Narrator) Except, based
on these Facebook timestamps,

1589
01:00:47,316 --> 01:00:50,316
this claim is a demonstrable lie

1590
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,819
because in addition to
posting she was pregnant

1591
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:55,324
two days earlier, Shannon
was talking to Cheri

1592
01:00:55,324 --> 01:00:55,331
two days earlier, Shannon
was talking to Cheri

1593
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:57,824
about it the morning
of the murder.

1594
01:00:57,826 --> 01:01:01,826
- If you go with the flow,
nothin's gonna happen to ya.

1595
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,333
However, once you
go with the flow

1596
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,833
you do get involved into it and

1597
01:01:06,835 --> 01:01:10,335
there's sometimes
no turning back.

1598
01:01:10,339 --> 01:01:12,339
- (Narrator) And then
she saw a way out.

1599
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:15,344
- They had said that
Vera had sprayed

1600
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:17,344
the pepper spray
upstairs to where

1601
01:01:17,346 --> 01:01:18,846
it was really bad.

1602
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:23,349
- No, Vera never did, but yes,

1603
01:01:23,352 --> 01:01:25,862
Shannon did come back furious.

1604
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:28,355
- At Vera.

1605
01:01:28,357 --> 01:01:30,357
- (Nicole) Shannon was
like, "That little bitch,

1606
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:33,359
"if she made me lose
my baby, I swear to God

1607
01:01:33,362 --> 01:01:34,863
"I'm going to kill her."

1608
01:01:34,863 --> 01:01:34,872
"I'm going to kill her."

1609
01:01:34,872 --> 01:01:38,862
And when she got back she
said she had a miscarriage

1610
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:41,367
and that she had to get
a D&C and everything else

1611
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,870
that goes along
with a miscarriage.

1612
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:44,372
- (Narrator) Nicole
had clearly developed

1613
01:01:44,372 --> 01:01:44,381
- (Narrator) Nicole
had clearly developed

1614
01:01:44,381 --> 01:01:47,873
a bond with Shannon, but she
didn't understand the game.

1615
01:01:47,876 --> 01:01:49,376
- Vera caused it.

1616
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:51,879
Blame everything on Vera.

1617
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,882
Vera already caused
everything else.

1618
01:01:53,882 --> 01:01:53,890
Vera already caused
everything else.

1619
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:55,882
Vera can cause this, too.

1620
01:01:56,885 --> 01:01:58,385
- (Narrator) And
with Danny and Nicole

1621
01:01:58,387 --> 01:02:00,887
accepting plea bargains,
the judge responded

1622
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:02,889
to criticism from
Voices for Vera.

1623
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:05,894
- Obviously the facts and
circumstances of this crime

1624
01:02:05,894 --> 01:02:05,901
- Obviously the facts and
circumstances of this crime

1625
01:02:05,901 --> 01:02:09,394
have been the subject of much
media and public attention.

1626
01:02:09,398 --> 01:02:11,398
- Then to hear the judge
say, "Oh, we're gonna provide

1627
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,400
"adequate punishment for
the ones involved in this."

1628
01:02:13,402 --> 01:02:15,904
30 days deferred with
five years probation

1629
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:15,912
30 days deferred with
five years probation

1630
01:02:15,912 --> 01:02:17,404
and two and a half
years reserved.

1631
01:02:17,406 --> 01:02:18,906
Dude, put 'em in jail.

1632
01:02:18,907 --> 01:02:20,907
- Many interested
persons have spoken out

1633
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:22,409
in the news media.

1634
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:25,414
- You think this is one
step toward some justice?

1635
01:02:25,414 --> 01:02:25,421
- You think this is one
step toward some justice?

1636
01:02:25,421 --> 01:02:26,914
I mean, what's going
through your mind?

1637
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:29,415
- I'm hoping it's one
step towards justice.

1638
01:02:29,418 --> 01:02:32,418
- Others have used various
forms of social media

1639
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:33,922
to express their views.

1640
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:33,931
To express their views.

1641
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:36,922
It is of course the right
of all of our citizens

1642
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:39,425
to speak freely and openly,
especially on matters

1643
01:02:39,428 --> 01:02:41,928
of great personal
and public interest.

1644
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:45,434
But while the sanctity of free
speech is beyond question,

1645
01:02:45,434 --> 01:02:45,440
But while the sanctity of free
speech is beyond question,

1646
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,434
it must also be
remembered that opinion

1647
01:02:47,436 --> 01:02:50,436
unconnected to fact, the law,
or for that matter, reality,

1648
01:02:50,439 --> 01:02:52,439
must be rejected.

1649
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:55,444
- (Narrator) But what is the
reality the court accepted?

1650
01:02:55,444 --> 01:02:55,451
- (Narrator) But what is the
reality the court accepted?

1651
01:02:55,451 --> 01:02:58,444
- Daniel Bixler, Shannon
Brooks, Zachary Brooks,

1652
01:02:58,447 --> 01:03:01,447
Garth Brooks, Cheri
Brooks, and I agreed

1653
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,460
to kill Vera Jo Reigle
on March 26, 2011.

1654
01:03:05,954 --> 01:03:08,454
We agreed to do this
because Shannon Brooks

1655
01:03:08,456 --> 01:03:11,457
said Vera Jo Reigle
caused her to miscarry.

1656
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,962
- (Narrator) Only, was
this really the motive?

1657
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:13,970
- (Narrator) Only, was
this really the motive?

1658
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,962
Well, I guess if you
believe the source

1659
01:03:15,964 --> 01:03:18,964
used by Nicole's lawyers.

1660
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:21,967
- Nicky's lawyer had came
to the house to talk to me

1661
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:25,474
and was wonderin'
why was Vera killed?

1662
01:03:25,474 --> 01:03:25,480
And was wonderin'
why was Vera killed?

1663
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,474
Was it because of jealousy
because Nicky thought

1664
01:03:27,476 --> 01:03:29,476
she wanted Danny?

1665
01:03:29,478 --> 01:03:31,978
Or was it 'cause
of the miscarriage?

1666
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,983
And I said, well, for one,

1667
01:03:34,983 --> 01:03:34,990
And I said, well, for one,

1668
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:38,983
Vera always will and
always will love Zachary.

1669
01:03:39,988 --> 01:03:42,488
She went to her
grave lovin' Zachary.

1670
01:03:42,491 --> 01:03:44,993
- (Narrator) So imagine Cheri's
delight at being presented

1671
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:45,001
- (Narrator) So imagine Cheri's
delight at being presented

1672
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:47,493
with a smorgasbord
of her own lies.

1673
01:03:47,496 --> 01:03:50,496
- Vera was killed
later on because of

1674
01:03:50,499 --> 01:03:51,999
the miscarriage of Shannon.

1675
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,002
- (Narrator) But events
leading up to the murder

1676
01:03:54,002 --> 01:03:54,010
- (Narrator) But events
leading up to the murder

1677
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:56,002
paint a very different picture.

1678
01:03:56,004 --> 01:03:59,004
For example, the first
time Vera got stabbed

1679
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:01,007
wasn't even that day.

1680
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:03,009
- She went into the bathroom

1681
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,514
and Danny and them followed her.

1682
01:04:05,514 --> 01:04:05,521
And Danny and them followed her.

1683
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:10,014
The first stabbing was when
Danny stabbed her in the leg.

1684
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:13,518
- Well, Cheri said
she took her finger

1685
01:04:13,522 --> 01:04:15,532
and stuck it in the hole,

1686
01:04:17,526 --> 01:04:21,026
the hole of her sore
where they stabbed her.

1687
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:24,533
- My finger went that
far into her leg.

1688
01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:24,539
- My finger went that
far into her leg.

1689
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:26,033
- (Narrator) This
is no nightmare.

1690
01:04:26,034 --> 01:04:29,534
This was Vera's
final day of life.

1691
01:04:29,538 --> 01:04:30,538
- That is one of
the ones that were

1692
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:32,039
mean to Vera.

1693
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:35,043
- Yes.

1694
01:04:35,043 --> 01:04:35,052
- Yes.

1695
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:38,543
- She had to pick up the dog
poop of Jackson and eat it.

1696
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:45,554
- I think they said
Chuckie made her eat

1697
01:04:45,554 --> 01:04:45,560
- I think they said
Chuckie made her eat

1698
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,554
the dog poop.

1699
01:04:48,557 --> 01:04:49,557
- They're all sadistic.

1700
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:51,058
They're all...

1701
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,059
They all had to have been.

1702
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:54,062
- I'm talkin' about
they took a plunger

1703
01:04:54,062 --> 01:04:54,071
- I'm talkin' about
they took a plunger

1704
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:55,062
and put it up (grunts).

1705
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,563
- They sodomized
her with it, yeah.

1706
01:04:56,565 --> 01:04:58,565
- She was completely naked.

1707
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:01,067
She was her on her
menstrual period that day.

1708
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:04,072
They took a toothbrush,
they raped her sexually

1709
01:05:04,072 --> 01:05:04,079
They took a toothbrush,
they raped her sexually

1710
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,572
with the toothbrush.

1711
01:05:05,574 --> 01:05:08,574
- And then she had to
use it for her mouth.

1712
01:05:08,577 --> 01:05:10,077
- (Narrator) The
following morning,

1713
01:05:10,078 --> 01:05:12,578
five hours before
the Mace incident

1714
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:15,083
they were trying
to stab her again.

1715
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:15,091
They were trying
to stab her again.

1716
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:17,583
- Daniel actually

1717
01:05:17,586 --> 01:05:20,586
gave me a knife and
asked me if I wanted

1718
01:05:20,589 --> 01:05:23,589
to slice her, you
know, cut her up.

1719
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:26,593
- (Narrator) This
was during a visit

1720
01:05:26,595 --> 01:05:29,095
from Punky's baby
mama, Angel Might.

1721
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:31,097
- I do know Zachary
was hitting her

1722
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:34,603
and then I can't remember
if it was Danny or Nicole

1723
01:05:34,603 --> 01:05:34,609
and then I can't remember
if it was Danny or Nicole

1724
01:05:34,609 --> 01:05:37,603
or both of them that actually
started hittin' her, too.

1725
01:05:37,606 --> 01:05:40,606
- And tellin' her to, you
know, "Shut up, bitch.

1726
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:42,109
"Be quiet.

1727
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:43,610
"I'm hittin' you," you know.

1728
01:05:43,612 --> 01:05:44,613
"Shut the fuck up."

1729
01:05:44,622 --> 01:05:46,613
You know, just hit her.

1730
01:05:46,615 --> 01:05:49,115
- Her and her mother
and her brother

1731
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:51,117
sat there for 45
minutes they said,

1732
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,619
watching this episode goin' on.

1733
01:05:55,123 --> 01:05:56,123
- Not only Nicole

1734
01:05:58,126 --> 01:05:58,626
and Danny,

1735
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:04,132
but then also little Chuckie
started gettin' into it,

1736
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:08,132
'cause I saw him with a
fishing pole striking Vera.

1737
01:06:08,136 --> 01:06:12,636
- Cheri had made up
this thing, I don't know

1738
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:15,143
how true it was, but
supposably Vera had given

1739
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:17,143
little K sour milk.

1740
01:06:18,146 --> 01:06:21,646
- She had gave Little
K the same milk

1741
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:24,152
that he went to bed on
instead of comin' out

1742
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,152
and rinsin' the cup out
and givin' him fresh milk,

1743
01:06:27,155 --> 01:06:29,655
she just went on and gave
that to him and told him,

1744
01:06:29,658 --> 01:06:31,158
"Get back on the couch
and lay back down,"

1745
01:06:31,159 --> 01:06:32,659
and covered him up.

1746
01:06:32,661 --> 01:06:34,663
- She was scared.

1747
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:36,163
- All cru, I mean all...
- All crunched up

1748
01:06:36,164 --> 01:06:39,664
in a little ball, like
in a fetal position.

1749
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:46,680
She lifted her head once
and I saw a cut on her nose,

1750
01:06:48,176 --> 01:06:49,176
a split lip.

1751
01:06:53,682 --> 01:06:56,685
- (Narrator) A half hour after
Angel and her mother left,

1752
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:58,685
the street fight
between the Brookses

1753
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,687
and the rival
neighborhood gang broke

1754
01:07:00,689 --> 01:07:03,189
out and someone
called the police.

1755
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:05,193
This sent Danny,
Nicole, and Zachary

1756
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:09,193
running to his Aunt
Sam's, Samantha Schwabb's.

1757
01:07:09,197 --> 01:07:11,697
They hid there in the
basement until the police left

1758
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,202
and were next seen
two hours later

1759
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:17,202
walking in an alley
three miles away.

1760
01:07:17,205 --> 01:07:18,705
- I was gettin' ready
to leave to head over

1761
01:07:18,707 --> 01:07:21,207
to take my kids someplace
and they was walkin' up

1762
01:07:21,209 --> 01:07:22,209
the alley towards my
house and they were like,

1763
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:23,210
"Where you goin'?"

1764
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:24,212
I said, "Well, we're leavin'."

1765
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:25,712
He goes, "Can you give
me a ride to my house?"

1766
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:27,214
- (Narrator) George Speck
lives by the Brooks gang's

1767
01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:30,715
favorite hangout,
the skateboard park.

1768
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:34,723
- Nicole Peters, Danny
Bixler, and Zachary.

1769
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:37,723
- (Narrator) His house is
also near something else,

1770
01:07:37,726 --> 01:07:41,726
the railroad tracks
where Vera was murdered.

1771
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:45,740
- Danny, Nicole, and Zachary
was at Samantha Schwabb's house

1772
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:51,735
over here, and walked down
these tracks around 4:30.

1773
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,743
Now, are you telling
me that they did not

1774
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,243
go and try to scout out
a place to kill Vera

1775
01:07:59,247 --> 01:08:01,247
five hours later?

1776
01:08:01,249 --> 01:08:03,249
- (Narrator) From the bridge
they continued down the tracks

1777
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:05,754
toward Alan Cap's
apartment, which is beside

1778
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:07,254
that rail line, too.

1779
01:08:07,255 --> 01:08:09,255
So in addition to
casing the murder scene,

1780
01:08:09,257 --> 01:08:12,257
they were also
plotting their escape.

1781
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,760
- (Nicole) And we
just started walking.

1782
01:08:13,762 --> 01:08:15,262
We were gonna walk
to somebody's house

1783
01:08:15,272 --> 01:08:17,763
and they were supposed
to take us to Kentucky.

1784
01:08:17,766 --> 01:08:19,266
- (Narrator) We know
this was their plan

1785
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:21,767
because the following
day after Vera was dead

1786
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,770
and Danny and Nicole
were arrested,

1787
01:08:23,772 --> 01:08:25,774
Zachary started
desperately calling Gina,

1788
01:08:25,782 --> 01:08:28,774
trying to use the escape
route for himself.

1789
01:08:28,777 --> 01:08:31,777
- Every time he'd call I'd
be like, "No, you don't need

1790
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,280
"to be comin' down here.

1791
01:08:33,281 --> 01:08:37,285
"They're just gonna put more
stuff on you for runnin' away."

1792
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:41,785
- Now mind you, Danny nor
Nicole knew George Speck

1793
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:45,293
or Alan Cap, so who's
the ring leader?

1794
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,293
And where is his sentence?

1795
01:08:48,797 --> 01:08:51,797
When is he going to get
charged for all of this?

1796
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,799
- (Narrator) By the time
the three co-conspirators

1797
01:08:53,802 --> 01:08:56,303
were riding across town in
the back of George's pickup,

1798
01:08:56,312 --> 01:08:58,304
they already had a cover story,

1799
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:02,306
the murder scene scouted, and
an escape plan ready to hatch.

1800
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:05,313
By 5:15 the Brooks house was
filled with pepper spray,

1801
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,313
forcing a complete evacuation.

1802
01:09:08,316 --> 01:09:10,816
- The Mace was upstairs but
it was comin' downstairs

1803
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:12,319
once Danny opened the door.

1804
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,820
- All the windows were open.

1805
01:09:13,822 --> 01:09:15,323
They were airin' the house out.

1806
01:09:15,332 --> 01:09:17,323
- (Narrator) Hospital
records show Shannon arrived

1807
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:19,325
at the ER at 5:32 p.m.

1808
01:09:19,327 --> 01:09:22,327
Around the same time,
while the Brooks house

1809
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:23,830
was being aired
out from the Mace,

1810
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:27,836
Danny and Nicole walked
over to his sister's place.

1811
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:30,836
- He told me that they
just asked him all day

1812
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:32,839
to do somethin' about her.

1813
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:34,342
- (Narrator) But was he
in a rage strong enough

1814
01:09:34,351 --> 01:09:35,842
to kill Vera?

1815
01:09:35,844 --> 01:09:37,844
- They were just, you
know, sayin' how much they

1816
01:09:37,846 --> 01:09:40,346
just didn't want
her around anymore.

1817
01:09:40,348 --> 01:09:41,848
And I mean, I just
figured that they would

1818
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,350
either kick her out
or something like that

1819
01:09:43,351 --> 01:09:47,355
or just tell her to
get her kid and leave,

1820
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,855
but that wasn't even, obviously,

1821
01:09:49,858 --> 01:09:51,358
that wasn't what
they were thinking.

1822
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,859
- (Interviewer) From what
I've been told is that

1823
01:09:52,861 --> 01:09:55,363
you were gettin' this kind
of pressure before the Mace

1824
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:56,363
ever went off.

1825
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:04,873
- (Narrator) So by elevating
Shannon from bit player

1826
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:08,373
to a starring role,
prosecutors got it backwards.

1827
01:10:08,376 --> 01:10:10,876
Like breaking her nose
for pushing the baby

1828
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:13,379
into a coffee table, or
beating her to a pulp

1829
01:10:13,381 --> 01:10:15,383
for eating Punky's Kit Kat bar,

1830
01:10:15,391 --> 01:10:19,383
they needed a rationalization
to blame the victim,

1831
01:10:19,387 --> 01:10:21,387
an excuse to punish her.

1832
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,890
That means Vera was not killed

1833
01:10:23,892 --> 01:10:26,895
because they accused her
of setting off the Mace.

1834
01:10:26,902 --> 01:10:28,895
They accused her of
setting off the Mace

1835
01:10:28,897 --> 01:10:30,897
for a reason to kill her.

1836
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:50,416
- (Narrator) At nine o'clock,
Zachary summoned Danny,

1837
01:10:50,418 --> 01:10:54,422
Nicole, and his brother
Garth to Scottie's room.

1838
01:10:54,428 --> 01:10:56,422
- I overheard the things,

1839
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:05,439
I was pretty much like, nah,
they're not really gonna do it.

1840
01:11:06,935 --> 01:11:09,935
- (Narrator) This meeting was
to decide where to kill Vera.

1841
01:11:09,938 --> 01:11:12,438
Danny wanted to do it in
a park they checked out

1842
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,443
earlier in the day, which
he felt was more secluded.

1843
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,443
- You remember that park, Alan,

1844
01:11:17,445 --> 01:11:21,445
that me, you, and
Garth went fishin' at?

1845
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:23,449
- It's right over there by,

1846
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:24,452
you know where
Center Street's at?

1847
01:11:24,461 --> 01:11:25,952
- (Interviewer) Yeah.

1848
01:11:25,954 --> 01:11:28,454
- That park that goes
down Center Street.

1849
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:29,456
Right by the bridge.

1850
01:11:29,457 --> 01:11:31,457
- (Narrator) But Zachary wanted
to go back to the bridge,

1851
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:33,959
insisting they stick to the
plan of having the train

1852
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:35,964
turn Vera's body into hamburger.

1853
01:11:35,972 --> 01:11:37,964
- They wanted everybody
to think that the train

1854
01:11:37,966 --> 01:11:39,466
- Hit her.
- Hit her.

1855
01:11:39,467 --> 01:11:41,467
- (Narrator) As the
murderers went into action,

1856
01:11:41,469 --> 01:11:43,469
Vera began to panic.

1857
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:45,473
- When they told her
to put her shoes on,

1858
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:47,973
she was like yelling, "Why?"

1859
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:48,976
You know, like, "Why?

1860
01:11:48,977 --> 01:11:50,477
"Why do you want me
to get my shoes on?"

1861
01:11:50,478 --> 01:11:52,478
And Zachary had went
up to her and said,

1862
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,483
"Just get your effin'
shoes on," ya know?

1863
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:55,983
So she--

1864
01:11:57,986 --> 01:11:59,986
- Zachary and Danny.

1865
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:02,488
And then Nicole had come
in and she was standing

1866
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,492
right by Vera's
door and she's like,

1867
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,492
"You need to put your
damn shoes on right now."

1868
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:10,495
And then Vera didn't hesitate
and she put her shoes on

1869
01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:13,998
and Zachary said he
was gonna go with 'em.

1870
01:12:14,002 --> 01:12:16,504
- (Narrator) But apparently
this was no comfort

1871
01:12:16,512 --> 01:12:18,004
because judging Vera's reaction,

1872
01:12:18,006 --> 01:12:21,006
she was just as scared
to leave with Zachary.

1873
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:23,509
- I think she knew
what was gonna happen.

1874
01:12:23,511 --> 01:12:27,015
I was sitting on the
couch right by her room.

1875
01:12:27,021 --> 01:12:30,015
She was lookin' at me
for, like, a way out.

1876
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:32,518
Like, she was tryin'
to tell me to help her.

1877
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,023
- (Narrator) When it became
clear Shannon was no help,

1878
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:37,023
she reached out to Scottie.

1879
01:12:37,025 --> 01:12:38,025
- She knew what's gonna come.

1880
01:12:38,026 --> 01:12:41,526
That's why she asked me
to come along with her.

1881
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:44,029
- Because she felt safe with him

1882
01:12:44,032 --> 01:12:46,534
and she wanted Scottie
to walk with her.

1883
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:48,534
- But I told her hold up,
I would have to go upstairs

1884
01:12:48,536 --> 01:12:51,036
real quick to get my shoes.

1885
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,540
Well, as I got upstairs

1886
01:12:56,544 --> 01:12:59,044
I pretty much was stopped

1887
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:00,047
from leaving.

1888
01:13:04,052 --> 01:13:07,055
- I was supposed to say Danny.

1889
01:13:07,062 --> 01:13:07,555
It wasn't.

1890
01:13:09,057 --> 01:13:11,557
It was Zachary who stopped me.

1891
01:13:14,062 --> 01:13:15,072
- My mother.

1892
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:21,565
But, like I said, Zachary's
the one who stopped me,

1893
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:24,572
not Danny, even though
I told the police

1894
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,572
it was Danny.

1895
01:13:29,077 --> 01:13:31,577
- That I think he
already knew what was up

1896
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:33,579
and he wanted to protect me.

1897
01:13:33,581 --> 01:13:34,582
- (Narrator) Scottie
was not the only one

1898
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:36,582
prevented from going.

1899
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:39,584
- When Zachary was
told to go upstairs

1900
01:13:39,587 --> 01:13:42,087
to get Scottie, it
was right at that time

1901
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:44,090
that she told Zachary,
"No, you're not gonna be

1902
01:13:44,092 --> 01:13:46,094
"a part of what
they're gonna do."

1903
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:48,094
- (Narrator) Then they
hustled Vera outside,

1904
01:13:48,096 --> 01:13:51,096
ignoring her pleas for her life.

1905
01:13:51,099 --> 01:13:53,099
- She said, "I don't wanna go.

1906
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:56,104
"I wanna stay here,"
and she was cryin'.

1907
01:13:56,111 --> 01:13:59,104
Vera was cryin'
wantin' to stay home.

1908
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:05,113
Nicole said, "No,
you're goin' with me now

1909
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,613
"or I'm gonna crack your head
right here on the porch."

1910
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:09,615
- (Narrator) The temperature
was below freezing

1911
01:14:09,617 --> 01:14:12,117
that night, yet Danny
wore a borrowed pair

1912
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,120
of dark blue gym
shorts out of respect

1913
01:14:14,122 --> 01:14:16,624
for their former
owner, Punky Brooks.

1914
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:18,624
He also wore a
blue Crips bandana

1915
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:21,626
signaling this was
official gang business.

1916
01:14:21,629 --> 01:14:24,129
- The ones that they
believe happened first,

1917
01:14:24,132 --> 01:14:27,635
'cause then there was
over, like overlay

1918
01:14:27,642 --> 01:14:30,135
where people had
stabbed the same areas,

1919
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:33,638
from what I heard, the
first ones were weaker,

1920
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:37,145
coming from a weaker
person, a female possibly.

1921
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:39,645
- She was cut from
almost ear to ear

1922
01:14:39,647 --> 01:14:42,647
in a very sort of sawing motion,

1923
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:45,653
it was described
as by the coroner.

1924
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,153
- (Narrator) This
initial failed attempt

1925
01:14:47,155 --> 01:14:49,655
as Vera's recovered
sweatshirt shows,

1926
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:52,157
happened while she
was still dressed.

1927
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,163
- In one final act of humiliation that forced her to strip.

1928
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:57,663
- Yeah, they found the
clothes scattered around

1929
01:14:57,665 --> 01:14:59,665
in the trees and
stuff, in the bushes.

1930
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:02,167
They found, like, her panties
and I think her shirt.

1931
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,170
They took 'em off and
then just threw 'em.

1932
01:15:04,172 --> 01:15:06,174
Didn't even try to hide that.

1933
01:15:06,182 --> 01:15:07,674
- A full day to day and a half

1934
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:09,175
before the murder
actually happened

1935
01:15:09,177 --> 01:15:11,677
that they were completely
messed up the whole time.

1936
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,679
Like, there was not
one sober moment.

1937
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:16,684
- He was heavily using
alcohol, marijuana, cocaine,

1938
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:20,184
and by his own account, an
excessive amount to ecstasy.

1939
01:15:20,188 --> 01:15:21,688
- (Narrator) When
questioned about why Vera

1940
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:24,189
was made to get naked,
Nicole Peters replied,

1941
01:15:24,192 --> 01:15:26,694
"It wasn't working at first."

1942
01:15:26,702 --> 01:15:29,694
Asked what his girlfriend
meant by this odd statement

1943
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:33,197
Danny Bixler explained,
"That knife was dull as hell

1944
01:15:33,201 --> 01:15:35,703
"and she couldn't get
it through the clothes."

1945
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:37,203
Which, by strange coincidence,

1946
01:15:37,205 --> 01:15:40,205
is the exact same reason
given by Cheri Brooks.

1947
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:43,708
- The only thing I
can think of is if

1948
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:45,713
you take your clothes
off, well then

1949
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:49,213
you get to get to the bare
skin and it'll go faster.

1950
01:15:49,217 --> 01:15:50,217
- (Narrator) These details told

1951
01:15:50,218 --> 01:15:53,218
in separate jailhouse
interviews by two people

1952
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:55,722
Cheri had not spoken to since
the night of the murder,

1953
01:15:55,731 --> 01:15:58,723
are something only the
killers would know.

1954
01:15:58,726 --> 01:16:00,726
- When they were
stabbing at her,

1955
01:16:00,728 --> 01:16:05,233
maybe it wasn't that she was
dyin' fast enough for 'em

1956
01:16:05,238 --> 01:16:07,733
because of the clothes.

1957
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:10,735
When ya stab somebody
that snags the clothes.

1958
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:13,738
- (Narrator) So what appeared
to be a staged sexual assault

1959
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:16,744
was actually just laziness
and they needed Vera's help

1960
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:20,244
to make it easier to kill her.

1961
01:16:20,248 --> 01:16:21,748
- It's almost as
if he's attempting

1962
01:16:21,749 --> 01:16:23,249
to minimize his conduct.

1963
01:16:23,251 --> 01:16:25,253
There's 21 stab wounds but
he said he only did six.

1964
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:27,753
But an examination of
those six stab wounds

1965
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:28,755
is also very telling.

1966
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:30,256
First the legs.

1967
01:16:30,258 --> 01:16:31,258
Why was she stabbed in the legs?

1968
01:16:31,259 --> 01:16:33,259
He said it was to keep
her from running away

1969
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:34,761
so they could
continue the abuse.

1970
01:16:34,771 --> 01:16:36,762
She couldn't get out
of that situation.

1971
01:16:36,764 --> 01:16:38,264
- (Narrator) Then he
mounted her from behind,

1972
01:16:38,266 --> 01:16:41,266
reached around and
cut her throat.

1973
01:16:41,269 --> 01:16:42,769
- They tried to cut her head off

1974
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:44,772
but couldn't get
through this bone here.

1975
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,772
So, it's like cut from here
to the spine bone back there.

1976
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:49,275
- I think they laid
her out on the tracks

1977
01:16:49,277 --> 01:16:50,777
after they slaughtered her neck

1978
01:16:50,778 --> 01:16:53,778
to make it look like the
train cut her neck like that.

1979
01:16:53,781 --> 01:16:56,284
- (Narrator) And then they
fled, leaving Vera behind,

1980
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:57,784
still alive.

1981
01:16:57,785 --> 01:17:02,285
- They left her to bleed out
on the railroad tracks alone,

1982
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,790
naked and in the
cold, and from there,

1983
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,293
he told the detectives,

1984
01:17:05,301 --> 01:17:06,793
he went to party.

1985
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:10,296
- They were celebrating, yeah.

1986
01:17:10,298 --> 01:17:12,298
- They called me up
and then they told me

1987
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,800
what they did.

1988
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:15,803
I thought they were messin'
with me, so I walked

1989
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:18,803
back to their house
to see if it was true.

1990
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:22,806
- I look at Nicole and she's
got this big smile on her face,

1991
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:25,313
you know, and she puts
her arms out like this

1992
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,813
like she wants me to hug her.

1993
01:17:26,814 --> 01:17:29,314
And she's like, "It's
done, it's done.

1994
01:17:29,317 --> 01:17:30,317
"No more."

1995
01:17:30,318 --> 01:17:31,818
And I was scared.

1996
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:34,319
And she just comes
in and hugs me.

1997
01:17:34,322 --> 01:17:38,332
- When they did come back
Danny went over to Zachary

1998
01:17:39,327 --> 01:17:41,327
and patted him on the back.

1999
01:17:41,329 --> 01:17:43,329
- When I go back
in the living room

2000
01:17:43,331 --> 01:17:46,834
and Danny's in there
high fivin' Zachary

2001
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:49,334
and then they go
into Cheri's room

2002
01:17:49,337 --> 01:17:51,337
and they're both
kind of laughing.

2003
01:17:51,339 --> 01:17:53,839
- And I got there,
they were talkin' about

2004
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:55,343
how they killed her and stuff.

2005
01:17:55,351 --> 01:17:58,343
I didn't believe it 'cause
after they said they did it,

2006
01:17:58,346 --> 01:18:01,346
Cheri was talkin' about
how she was with Larry,

2007
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:02,849
her boyfriend.

2008
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:05,353
- And then that's
when Nicole had said,

2009
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,853
I got my first teardrop.

2010
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:08,354
I finally got it.

2011
01:18:10,358 --> 01:18:13,358
- She says that to Cheri
and she gives Cheri a hug

2012
01:18:13,361 --> 01:18:15,363
and Cheri hugs her back and they

2013
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:16,863
start laughin'.

2014
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:18,864
- (Narrator) And why
wouldn't they celebrate?

2015
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:21,366
To them Vera was the
abuser of baby Willadean,

2016
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:24,872
killer of Punky,
smasher of Cheri's feet.

2017
01:18:24,879 --> 01:18:27,872
Now that evil bitch was
out of Zachary's life

2018
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:30,875
and she left without
taking Cheri's baby.

2019
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:34,378
- They came back
and switched clothes

2020
01:18:34,382 --> 01:18:36,884
and then pretty much
went out to get drunk.

2021
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:40,884
- Cheri called me and said
Danny wants to come back over.

2022
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:42,388
- While Vera's body
was still warm,

2023
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:45,393
Nicole was visibly excited.

2024
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,893
- She was excited and ecstatic.

2025
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,895
She wasn't sorry.

2026
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:52,398
You could see that in her face.

2027
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,403
- She was smiling
and happy and just,

2028
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:59,403
you know, I've never seen
somebody that happy before.

2029
01:18:59,407 --> 01:19:01,407
- (Narrator) But on the tracks,
something was happening.

2030
01:19:01,409 --> 01:19:05,913
Vera was becoming an angel
and she had a few surprises.

2031
01:19:05,919 --> 01:19:08,913
Using her last ounce of
energy she pulled herself

2032
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:11,416
off the rails and
contracted into a ball

2033
01:19:11,419 --> 01:19:12,919
only 12 inches high.

2034
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,922
- She curled up in
a fetal position,

2035
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:17,422
that's the way she always
slept, in the fetal position.

2036
01:19:17,425 --> 01:19:18,925
- (Narrator)
Miraculously this allowed

2037
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,426
the front of the train,
which police later found

2038
01:19:21,429 --> 01:19:25,433
to have a 13" clearance, to
pass over without touching her.

2039
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,433
- I started feeling
like something was wrong

2040
01:19:28,436 --> 01:19:32,936
when Zach decided to pretty
much drink the entire,

2041
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,942
one entire bottle
of vodka to himself.

2042
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:36,942
- (Narrator) The angel
started haunting Zachary

2043
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:40,444
whose actions the rest of that
night speak for themselves.

2044
01:19:40,448 --> 01:19:45,453
- Zachary said out loud that
he only wanted to get drunk

2045
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:48,953
just so he can forget about
the whole entire thing.

2046
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:52,456
- And he looked all depressed
and upset about something.

2047
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:57,465
Like he was involved deeply
with his own thoughts.

2048
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:01,965
- Zach was doing,
like, weird stuff like,

2049
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:04,469
like hit his head
on walls and stuff.

2050
01:20:04,472 --> 01:20:05,972
- And I was talkin' about him.

2051
01:20:05,982 --> 01:20:08,473
I'm like, so, why is he so sad?

2052
01:20:09,477 --> 01:20:10,977
And I'm like, "What's going on?"

2053
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:13,478
And that's when
Danny decided to say,

2054
01:20:13,481 --> 01:20:16,484
"Well, I slit her throat."

2055
01:20:16,491 --> 01:20:17,984
And I was like, "What'd you do?"

2056
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:19,985
He's like, "I slit
that bitch's throat."

2057
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:21,487
- (Narrator) So it was
Zach's guilty conscience

2058
01:20:21,489 --> 01:20:23,989
that led Desta to
confront her brother,

2059
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,994
which ultimately
broke open the case.

2060
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:28,494
- They're sick.

2061
01:20:28,496 --> 01:20:29,996
They need help.

2062
01:20:29,997 --> 01:20:33,997
But when it's their time and
they have to meet their maker,

2063
01:20:38,005 --> 01:20:39,005
hey.

2064
01:20:41,509 --> 01:20:43,509
- (Narrator) And when
it came to motive,

2065
01:20:43,511 --> 01:20:46,013
on the final day of
court, the judge admitted

2066
01:20:46,021 --> 01:20:49,513
he still had no idea
why the murder happened.

2067
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:52,017
- As we grapple to
make sense of this,

2068
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,519
perhaps as some have suggested,

2069
01:20:53,521 --> 01:20:56,524
that our community has
failed Vera Jo Reigle

2070
01:20:56,531 --> 01:21:00,024
and I'm sure that debate
will continue, but we must

2071
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:01,527
also not forget that
there were those

2072
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:05,032
who were directly responsible
for Miss Reigle's death,

2073
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:07,532
and in particular
defendant Daniel Bixler

2074
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:10,035
who is here today for
the court for sentencing.

2075
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:14,037
The evidence reveals that
on March 26th of 2011

2076
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:17,545
the defendant assumed the
role of self-appointed judge,

2077
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:19,045
jury, and executioner.

2078
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:20,046
For what?

2079
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:23,548
Jealousy, revenge,
unfocused rage,

2080
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:26,554
some perverse sense
of family honor?

2081
01:21:26,561 --> 01:21:29,054
It doesn't appear
we'll ever really know.

2082
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:30,056
♪ Of mine

2083
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:33,557
♪ I'm gonna let it shine

2084
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:36,564
♪ This little light of mine

2085
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:40,064
- (Narrator) In the
end, Vera is an angel,

2086
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:43,067
one who's wretched
life and bad death,

2087
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:46,080
shines a light on
the rest of us.

2088
01:21:47,575 --> 01:21:49,575
- And Your Honor, at this
time I'd like to read a letter

2089
01:21:49,577 --> 01:21:52,077
that was found in
Vera Jo's purse

2090
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:54,079
after she was murdered.

2091
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:56,582
And this is what it says.

2092
01:21:56,584 --> 01:21:57,584
It says, "I love you Willadean.

2093
01:21:57,584 --> 01:22:00,085
"You are a good little
baby girl to us.

2094
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:04,087
"I'm glad to be your mommy
and I'm glad that I had you

2095
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:08,095
"on November 4th at 4:16 a.m., six pounds 2 ounces,

2096
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:09,095
"19 inches long.

2097
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,596
"Mommy loves you."

2098
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:12,598
- (Narrator) Worse, by
not getting convicted

2099
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,603
of a major felony, Zachary
still had parental rights

2100
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:17,103
to Willadean.

2101
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:19,604
- Oh yeah, or they would not
be makin' a reovocation plan

2102
01:22:19,607 --> 01:22:23,107
for Zachary to get
his daughter back.

2103
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,112
- (Narrator) A case
already being discussed

2104
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,612
when Zachary's friend
Alan Cap arrived

2105
01:22:27,615 --> 01:22:29,615
at 10 o'clock on the
night of the murder.

2106
01:22:29,617 --> 01:22:32,617
- Alls I heard is
somethin' about them

2107
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:35,122
wantin' to kill
Vera about custody.

2108
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:38,122
- She had that in her mind
that that's her kid now

2109
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:41,625
and Vera had it but
that's her kid now

2110
01:22:41,629 --> 01:22:43,629
and she's gonna keep it.

2111
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:44,631
And she had to

2112
01:22:44,632 --> 01:22:46,634
get rid of Vera because
Vera wanted to move out

2113
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:49,134
and take the baby, too.

2114
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:52,136
- Like, I was right here
and then their room's

2115
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:53,639
like right here.

2116
01:22:53,641 --> 01:22:57,151
They were all in a group
talkin' about killin' Vera.

2117
01:22:58,646 --> 01:23:03,146
- Like, if Vera dies
then Zach gets custody.

2118
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:06,153
- (Narrator) But why at this
moment were they celebrating

2119
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,653
Zachary getting sole custody?

2120
01:23:08,656 --> 01:23:11,156
According to the
lawyers, it was all about

2121
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:14,158
Shannon's phony
miscarriage, wasn't it?

2122
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:16,664
- They were talkin' about
Zach havin' custody.

2123
01:23:16,671 --> 01:23:20,164
They never said
anything about Shannon.

2124
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:22,167
- (Narrator) A version
of events confirmed

2125
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:24,169
by the killer himself.

2126
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:27,174
- (Interviewer) And did they
give an indication of why

2127
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:29,674
they wanted this done to Vera?

2128
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,194
- (Narrator) It is a hope
Cheri still holds strong

2129
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:51,696
as she sits in
great anticipation,

2130
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:55,709
waiting for the return of
her lost little baby girl.

2131
01:23:56,704 --> 01:24:00,204
- I added Daddy to
the picture. (Laughs)

2132
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,707
Had to copy her daddy there.

2133
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:05,720
'Cause I'm gettin'
ready to frame it.

2134
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:10,714
Still have to show him
Zachary and her look alike.
