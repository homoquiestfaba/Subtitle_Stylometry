1
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:19,439
It hurts, it hurts.

2
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:21,757
You're doing fine, Kathy.
Keep breathing.

3
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:24,760
In, out.

4
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,195
That's it.

5
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:47,682
Ray, pull over.

6
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,883
Ray! Pull over!

7
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:42,843
We have had a healthy baby boy.

8
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,041
Let Ray's life be a lesson.

9
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:33,597
The fever still threatens
but will not harm us...

10
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:36,486
...if we live according to God's law.

11
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:39,366
Solidarity and steadfastness.

12
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:41,757
We are the union of the divine...

13
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:46,364
...and shall cherish
equilibrium and peace.

14
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,358
Let us pray.

15
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,125
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

16
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:55,926
...I shall fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

17
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,043
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

18
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:01,643
- I want him back. I want him back.
- Thou preparest a table before me...

19
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,957
- Amanda.
- This didn't have to happen!

20
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,924
Can't you see? It's all a lie.

21
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,601
Poor girl. You're ill. You need help.

22
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,085
- I'm not sick!
- Amanda.

23
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:14,398
She'll be fine.
The doctor will take care of her.

24
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,285
- All right.
- That's all right.

25
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:19,126
It's all right. It's gonna be okay.

26
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,872
<i>Just before the Civil War,</i>
<i>there was a mission of...</i>

27
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,232
Get you some gas?

28
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,994
No, thanks, but maybe
you can help me. I'm a little lost.

29
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,549
I'm looking for Rockwell Falls.

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,230
I know I'm close.
I must've missed a turn.

31
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,437
According to my map...

32
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,231
Well, Toto, I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

33
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,433
Damn.

34
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,552
You okay?

35
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,836
Yeah, I'm fine. Looks like you're not.

36
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,711
You got a couple flats.

37
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,634
Yeah.

38
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,473
No reception.
I think I could use some help.

39
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,155
I can't help you. Head back to Bromine.
It's the last town that you passed.

40
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,437
That's 50 miles back.

41
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,395
If I was you, I'd start walking.

42
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,677
Afternoon.

43
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,512
Howdy.

44
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,638
Looks like I need some help.
I have a couple of flat tires.

45
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,392
That's quite a pothole back there.

46
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,030
No problem. I'll call you
a tow truck from Bromine.

47
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,714
Actually, I need to get
to Rockwell Falls.

48
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,917
I'm with the Census Bureau
on assignment. Steve Kady.

49
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,712
Hold on a second.
Let me see what I can do.

50
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,149
Sheriff, we got a guy
with a couple flats inside the line.

51
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,151
<i>You know what to do, deputy.</i>

52
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,311
Yeah, well,
he's with the Census Bureau.

53
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,832
We'll meet you at the mayor's.

54
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,998
Come on, deputy.

55
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,199
So put on your happy face.
We'll go join the welcome wagon.

56
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,519
Mr. Kady...

57
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,712
...Deputy Bobby Caine.

58
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,634
Sorry, we don't get too many
visitors around here.

59
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,711
When we do,
it's like the Second Coming.

60
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,189
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
Grab your suitcase.

61
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,557
- Is my car gonna be all right?
- Tow truck will be by here in a bit.

62
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,076
Don't worry about your things.
We're real honest around here.

63
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,595
Never any crime
in Rockwell Falls.

64
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,712
Must be nice.

65
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,512
You ever worry about a collision?

66
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,877
Except for a few delivery trucks,
no one goes in the other direction.

67
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,951
There's no reason to.

68
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,318
Everything we need is right here.

69
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,233
Where are we headed?

70
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,879
To meet the mayor.

71
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,715
There's no motel in town,
but he'll know where to put you up.

72
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,590
What's with the dogs?

73
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,469
Man's best friend. You can never have
too many friends in this town.

74
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,632
Welcome. Welcome.
Mayor Gus Grateman.

75
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,555
Sheriff Jim Calcutt
and Deputy Christian Hecker.

76
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,032
- Steve Kady. Nice to meet you.
- What brings you to town, Mr. Kady?

77
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,997
Surveys for the Census Bureau.

78
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,272
Updating our computers
in Washington.

79
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,716
Shouldn't be more than a few days.
I hope it's not too much trouble.

80
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,190
No. No trouble at all.
Stay as long as you like.

81
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,994
Enjoy everything
our little town has to offer.

82
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,878
If you need anything, you just ask.

83
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,076
It would help to have access
to old surveys.

84
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,549
Oh, Harmony Evans
keeps track of the records.

85
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,718
I'll arrange it for you
to drop by any time.

86
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,589
Bobby, why don't we take
Mr. Kady here over to Belma's.

87
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,552
She's sure to take good care of you.

88
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,398
- All right.
- Sheriff.

89
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,234
It's Wanda Syde.
Woke up with marks on her.

90
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,671
- She's real sick.
- We're headed that way.

91
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,550
Just a slight detour, Mr. Kady.
Only be a few minutes.

92
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,992
We'll be right back, Mr. Kady.

93
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,950
This ain't no coincidence.

94
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,829
Mr. Kady. Mrs. Syde just came down
with a bad set of boils.

95
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,638
She'll be fine soon enough.

96
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,030
Deputy Caine will take you
up to Belma's now.

97
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,679
Oh, Mr. Kady, one more thing.

98
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,511
Our traditions are very important
in the community.

99
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,836
Do your best to mind them.

100
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,032
Of course.

101
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,432
Belma's got a daughter, mind you.
I'm gonna marry her one day.

102
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,113
Congratulations.

103
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,511
And it's not true what they say about
the mother-daughter thing either.

104
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,591
Bobby.

105
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,631
You must be Mr. Kady.

106
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,314
- Nice to meet you.
- News travels fast in this town.

107
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,596
It doesn't have far to go.
Come in, come in.

108
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,873
It's not fancy, but it's filled with TLC.

109
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,634
- It's beautiful.
- Wait till you see the garden out back.

110
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,356
Hey. I thought I told you
to keep walking.

111
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,154
Courtney, this is Mr. Kady
from Chicago.

112
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,788
He's in town
for some overnight business.

113
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,555
I know. We've met. Sort of.

114
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,994
Gentlemen.

115
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,397
I take it you know that we have
a friend from the Census Bureau...

116
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,870
...staying at the Lovett's till we can
find something more permanent.

117
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,430
He's very nice, so do your best
to make him feel at home.

118
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,754
Henry...

119
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,558
...it's your wife, Ruby.

120
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,191
All right, it's done.
Ruby is our new festival host.

121
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,955
And if you haven't done so already,
remember to stop your clocks.

122
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,914
Solidarity and steadfastness.

123
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,878
We are the union of the divine...

124
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,350
...and we shall cherish
equilibrium and peace.

125
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,996
Thank you, gentlemen.

126
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,633
<i>Smile.</i>

127
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,315
That's a good one.

128
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,869
I don't know how anyone
can look at numbers all day.

129
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,239
Well, if you look at them as just
numbers, I guess it can get pretty dry.

130
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,075
The numbers I work with represent
people, reveal the world they live in...

131
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,276
...what their community has,
what it needs.

132
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,476
You'd be surprised
how much you can learn.

133
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,949
They are the only thing in life...

134
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,992
...that always make sense.

135
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,196
Like Pythagoras says,
"Numbers rule the universe."

136
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,237
You speak the truth, Mr. Kady.

137
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,351
I'm just surprised such a smart man
like yourself is still without a family.

138
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,795
But that will change soon, I'm sure.

139
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,191
There is nothing more important
around here.

140
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,115
Gosh, it's been 12 summers
since our Lyle passed.

141
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,716
I'm just sorry that Courtney
didn't get to spend more time with him.

142
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,759
Died from the fever.
And he was as strong as an ox.

143
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,195
And no one saw it coming.

144
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,953
Thank you.

145
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,348
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to surprise you.

146
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,275
- I couldn't sleep.
- Yeah, I couldn't either.

147
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,195
Let me make you something.

148
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,952
I was sorry to hear about your father.

149
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,634
- Were you close?
- Yes. Very.

150
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,638
What about you? You lost someone.

151
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,479
I saw it in your eyes at dinnertime.

152
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,076
My wife and daughter.

153
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,956
They died in an accident
two years ago.

154
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,796
Oh, my God.
You must miss them very much.

155
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,713
Sorry.

156
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,233
Well...

157
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,199
- This is gonna help you sleep tonight.
- Thank you.

158
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,758
You know, it could use
a little more garlic.

159
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,514
- Good morning, Mr. Kady.
- Morning.

160
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,670
Careful, Mr. Kady!

161
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,076
Morning, Mr. Kady.

162
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,113
Wow, that's the low-cal special?

163
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,357
What's the fuss?

164
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,038
Ruby Flynn was picked last night
to be festival host.

165
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,794
It's, like, the biggest honor
anyone can have.

166
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,394
- You ever been chosen?
- No.

167
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,471
Someday maybe...

168
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,230
...but hopefully I won't be around.

169
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,559
What's Chicago like, Steve?

170
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,952
- You've never been?
- No. I've never been anywhere.

171
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,953
The weather's rough.

172
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,317
The four seasons are winter, winter,
winter and the Fourth of July.

173
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,075
But when the snow is blowing,
horizontally...

174
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,835
...across the Michigan Avenue Bridge,
you can slip into these little bars...

175
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,558
- Courtney?
...hear amazing jazz...

176
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,995
I'm really sorry.
I have to get back to work.

177
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,793
How's it going, Mr. Kady?

178
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,433
All right.

179
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,795
You know, my office
thought there was an error.

180
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,273
I still have a lot to go, but the first two
list the population at exactly 436.

181
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,596
Does that sound right to you?

182
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,990
Everything tends to stay the same
around here.

183
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,475
Like Pythagoras said,
"Numbers rule the universe."

184
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,280
I ran into Belma.
She told me what you said at dinner.

185
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,635
And I thought it was pretty.

186
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,556
Harmony.

187
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,871
One question. In this survey
I have the Hillenbock family of four.

188
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,873
- Do you know where they live?
- That poor family.

189
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,397
They fell ill,
but they're doing much better now.

190
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,469
That's great.

191
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,713
- Do you know where I can find them?
- You'll have to ask the mayor.

192
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,599
So you don't know?

193
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,117
A family can't go missing
in a town this size, can it?

194
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,271
You'll have to ask the mayor.

195
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,635
I'll have to ask the mayor.

196
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,356
Wonderful.

197
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,194
Why won't anyone give me
a straight answer?

198
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,511
Well, where they're staying
really isn't fit for a family.

199
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,832
And knowing Mac, he wouldn't
take kindly to visitors. Matter of pride.

200
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,718
You understand that, don't you?

201
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,872
You understand, mayor, I'm gonna
have to interview these people.

202
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,715
Well, you can interview them
after the festival. Very sweet people.

203
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,393
And the missus...

204
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,439
...she makes the best blueberry muffins
this side of the Mississippi.

205
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,396
Relax, Mr. Kady.
Have some apple pie.

206
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,754
You have plenty of time for working.

207
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,950
People, you'd think this was
the first festival we ever had.

208
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,636
- How'd it go today?
- Good. Everyone was really friendly.

209
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,951
You know what they say.
Welcome all newcomers as family...

210
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,510
...and they become family.
- They don't say that in Chicago.

211
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,912
To Steve-O. Our new friend.

212
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,231
And to Rockwell Falls.
The most perfect place on earth.

213
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,031
Aames and his brother Kip
make this fine whiskey themselves.

214
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,954
Smooth.

215
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,953
Attaboy.

216
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,149
I'll get rid of them boils.

217
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,711
We're gonna help you through this,
Amanda.

218
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,111
- No. I just had a bad dream.
- That's how the fever always starts.

219
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,396
You're coming face to face
with your own death.

220
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,949
- Our treatment is the only way...
- Please! Stop it!

221
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,396
...to keep you from getting worse.
- No! Please, no!

222
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,599
- What was that?
- This old town's got...

223
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,796
...some electrical problems.

224
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,520
Don't worry about it.
Just something we live with.

225
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,234
- Out of the way, deputy.
- I can't do that.

226
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,030
- What's on your mind, Farmer?
- We were fine...

227
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,553
...until he came along.

228
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,713
Come on, now.

229
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,314
We welcome all newcomers
like family, remember?

230
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,710
It's the prophecy.

231
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,393
Don't take another step.

232
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,276
- I'll kill you. I swear.
- You're not gonna do that.

233
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,592
Hand me the gun.

234
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,752
Go on home.

235
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,876
I'll hold on to this for you.

236
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,756
I thought there wasn't ever
any crime in Rockwell Falls.

237
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,078
He wasn't gonna shoot.

238
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,550
His wife's sick and he's
temporarily lost his senses.

239
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,029
Besides, he's a lousy shot.

240
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,471
Well, he didn't have to be great.
He was 10 feet away.

241
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,756
What was all that about anyway?
What prophecy?

242
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,754
Just some local superstition. Trust me,
Steve, he wasn't gonna shoot.

243
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,037
There's never been a murder
in Rockwell Falls. Never.

244
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,155
Well, statistically speaking,
you're due.

245
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,678
I'm 51, born here like most,
never married and no children.

246
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,593
- That is about it.
- Ever skinned an apple, Mr. Kady?

247
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,915
No, I can't say that I have.

248
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,953
Take this and, gently,
with your thumb near the blade...

249
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,031
...in a circular motion...

250
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,876
I have a listing for your neighbor,
Ray Jacobs, and his daughter Amanda.

251
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,190
- Do you know where I can reach them?
- Oh, dear.

252
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,157
I'm afraid Ray is not coming back.

253
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,710
He passed away a couple of days ago.
Terrible car accident.

254
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,114
- Was his daughter in the accident?
- No, thank the Lord.

255
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,191
But that doesn't mean
she isn't hurting.

256
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,920
Though the good doctor is doing
everything he can.

257
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,990
Well, it's not quite as good
as yours but...

258
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,479
Very nice.

259
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,593
All right.

260
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,996
Please, take one for the road.

261
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,435
Thanks very much.
And thanks for your cooperation.

262
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,592
If everyone's as quick as you
I'll be out of here in a couple days.

263
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,638
I doubt it, Mr. Kady. Have a nice day.

264
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,316
Solidarity and steadfastness.

265
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,278
We are the union of the divine...

266
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,991
...and we shall cherish
equilibrium and peace.

267
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,152
Very good. And who would like
to lead us in the holy words...

268
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,992
...as they were passed down?

269
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,516
Easy, Steve-O, it's just me.
I didn't mean to scare you.

270
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,911
Just came to give you the good news.
Farmer's wife is fine.

271
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,550
She just had some spoiled milk and
he wanted me to pass on his apologies.

272
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,871
- Well, that's good news. Thanks.
- So where you headed?

273
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,753
- The Greaver residence.
- I'll give you a ride.

274
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,192
Ms. Dresden was just teaching
the kids a little local history...

275
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,271
...as it was laid down
by Seymour Grateman.

276
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,318
It's no wonder people grow up
with crazy thoughts around here.

277
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,758
Easy, Steve-O. I was raised the same
way and it didn't screw me up, did it?

278
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,198
It's a little early to tell.

279
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,914
Dr. Greaver?

280
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,680
- Inside.
- Thank you.

281
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,356
Mr. Kady, of course.

282
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,351
Nice to meet you. Please come in.

283
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,636
- Ernie, she'll be right with you.
- Thank you.

284
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,918
Just give me a moment.

285
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,392
You rest easy, Betsy.
Call me if you need anything.

286
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,278
Thank you, doctor.

287
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,795
- There.
- What happened to her?

288
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,996
Doctor-patient privilege, Mr. Kady.

289
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,628
I'm sure you understand.
Please follow me.

290
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,235
My name is Dr. Harold James Greaver.
I'm 64 years old.

291
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,313
Married to Mildred, my wife, who
acts also as my nurse. She's 63.

292
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,792
And Amanda Jacobs, is she here?
I heard you've been treating her.

293
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,839
Technically she doesn't live here, but,
yes, she is under our care as a patient.

294
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,752
Her mother died years ago.

295
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,480
After her father died recently
she started to exhibit...

296
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,519
...symptoms of schizophrenia,
paranoia and depression.

297
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,716
An emotional fever of sorts.

298
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,955
Excuse me. Hello?

299
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,553
I'll be right over.

300
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,029
My apologies. I have urgent
business to attend to.

301
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,432
If you need more from me, my wife will
be happy to arrange an appointment.

302
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,875
- She'll be down in a moment.
- Thank you.

303
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,398
Help me. Help! Help me!

304
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,353
I assure you, Mr. Kady,
she's perfectly fine.

305
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,834
She knows you're here.

306
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,754
And she did it because she
likes to make a first impression.

307
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,873
Well, tell her she made one.

308
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,793
I understand.
It can be a little unsettling.

309
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,598
Please see yourself out.

310
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,600
<i>It was strange, like she was</i>
<i>trying to get my attention.</i>

311
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,479
<i>Of course she was.</i>
<i>That poor girl, she's suffering from...</i>

312
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,478
...schizophrenia, paranoia,
thinking everyone is out to get her.

313
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,551
And that's why she's in the hospital.

314
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,439
- What? You mean, Dr. Greaver's?
- Yeah.

315
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,388
All I saw on his wall were "good
doctor" certificates from the town.

316
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,711
- Where did he go to medical school?
- He's a good doctor, Mr. Kady.

317
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,753
Greaver family's been taking
care of us for over 100 years.

318
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,480
Knowledge passed down
generations to generations...

319
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,279
...much like it has across
the world for centuries.

320
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,479
If he didn't go to medical school,
it's against the law.

321
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,473
You know, around here,
the law is my business.

322
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,073
And before you judge, you should
know it's always worked for us.

323
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,869
Just because we do things different
than in the city doesn't mean it's wrong.

324
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,600
Those outside laws.
They don't apply to us.

325
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,070
We're better off for it.
And that's the way it's always been.

326
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,193
Now, you two, you have
a good afternoon.

327
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,794
- Steve-O, don't let this bother you.
- It's not right.

328
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,275
Lord knows what mistakes
a guy like that can make.

329
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,550
I don't care how long
his family's been practicing.

330
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,478
It's not the 1800s.

331
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,108
To some around here, it still is.

332
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,151
Well, that's not good enough.

333
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,673
Come on, I know what will
take your mind off this stuff.

334
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,708
Well, this goes without saying,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

335
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,348
Don't point it at your face.

336
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,238
This here is your aim.

337
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,872
Just step up, take a good look...

338
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,999
...and squeeze. Don't pull the trigger.
Squeeze it.

339
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,190
Try it again, but this time...

340
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,948
...aim for the bottles.

341
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,990
So you're not married, huh?

342
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,112
I was.

343
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,111
She passed away.

344
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,350
I'm so sorry.

345
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,355
I bet she was amazing.

346
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,837
Yeah, she was.

347
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,669
That's how I feel about Courtney.
We were meant to be together.

348
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,479
I know it more than I know anything.

349
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,118
But sometimes she looks at me
as that dopey kid she grew up with.

350
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,276
Just makes it hard sometimes...

351
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,477
...you know, to ask her to marry me.

352
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,951
Just be yourself, Bobby.

353
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,835
If it's meant to be, it will be.

354
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,351
Thanks for listening.

355
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,191
You're a good friend.

356
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,032
You too.

357
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,830
What do you say we go
shooting again tomorrow?

358
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,911
- Sure thing.
- Now that's the spirit...

359
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,991
...that beat the Germans.

360
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,756
And when we get back to the Lovett's,
check the barn. I bet your ride's done.

361
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,476
What are you doing?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

362
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,438
There was somebody
standing in here, just staring.

363
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,916
You must be talking about Curly.
He takes walks like everyone else.

364
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,709
- Just ends up in stranger places.
- What's wrong with him?

365
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,394
He had the fever,
but he's one of the lucky ones.

366
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,189
It passed, and thanks to Dr. Greaver,
he lost only a little spunk.

367
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,435
It looks like you have a short here.
I'm gonna fix that for you, okay?

368
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,514
<i>Now let us repeat God's law.</i>

369
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,752
<i>Solidarity and steadfastness.</i>

370
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,549
<i>Solidarity and steadfastness.</i>

371
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,598
<i>We are the union of the divine.</i>

372
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,150
<i>We are the union of the divine.</i>

373
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,632
<i>And we shall cherish</i>
<i>equilibrium and peace.</i>

374
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,874
<i>And we shall cherish</i>
<i>equilibrium and peace.</i>

375
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,030
Learn to love it here.

376
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,753
Maybe you can help me. I'm a little
lost. I'm looking for Rockwell Falls.

377
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,789
Excuse me. Hello? Sir. Hey, wait!

378
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,350
Hello, sir, wait a minute. Please.

379
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,275
There you go, fellas.
Take it easy, don't work too hard.

380
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,592
Howdy! Mr. Kady. Edgar Smalls.
Well, what can I do for you?

381
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,115
I need a new fuse for Belma's barn.

382
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,236
Let's see what I got.

383
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,992
That delivery guy that just left.

384
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,276
- Yeah. Red?
- Yeah, when I was outside town...

385
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,830
...I asked to find Rockwell Falls.
He didn't help me.

386
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,151
Strange fellow. Comes in a few
times a week, depending.

387
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,311
The delivery guys
mind their own business.

388
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,869
But that's how we like it.

389
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,518
Where are your manners, Curly?

390
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,318
Can't you see we have a new friend?

391
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,597
Say hello to Mr. Kady.
He's moved here from Chicago.

392
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,276
- Actually, I'm just passing through.
- Oh, sure, my apologies.

393
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,276
We've already met, Curly.

394
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,919
You were in Belma's barn.

395
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,472
You remember?

396
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,394
He's not 100 percent, Mr. Kady.
He probably won't remember.

397
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,438
Hasn't been the same
since his brush with the fever.

398
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,230
- Run! Run!
- Curly!

399
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,075
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Kady.
He's never acted up like this.

400
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,312
- I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
- It's okay.

401
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,959
It's fine.

402
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,551
You all right, mister?

403
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,112
Yeah. Obie...

404
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,992
- You know Amanda Jacobs?
- I guess. As much as anybody.

405
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,475
- Why is she at Dr. Greaver's?
- She has the fever.

406
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,596
That's the only reason
anyone goes there.

407
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,718
Watch. She'll be different
when she gets out.

408
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,313
How will she be different?

409
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,988
- She'll be happy.
- What's the fever?

410
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,954
Obie, what's the fever?

411
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,116
I don't know.

412
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,272
But they all look the same
when they get it.

413
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,237
What do they look like?

414
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,632
Like you.

415
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,550
Never any crime, huh?

416
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,952
Hello, Amanda.

417
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,193
My name is Steve.

418
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,590
I saw you in the window.
I wanted to talk to you.

419
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,228
You talk to everybody, don't you?

420
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,078
Right. I work with
the Census Bureau.

421
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,117
Not anymore.

422
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,950
- What do you mean?
- They'll find you a new job.

423
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,749
And if you want to leave,
you're sick...

424
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,833
...and they'll save you,
just like they're trying to save me.

425
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,236
- They're watching you.
- Who is? Who's watching?

426
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,756
Everyone. Can't you see it?

427
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,230
Okay, Amanda.

428
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,868
Do you know what
happened to your father?

429
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,510
He tried to leave.

430
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,830
And they killed him?

431
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,349
They say God did.

432
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,036
What happened here?

433
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,193
I'm just going to look, okay?

434
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,516
Did Dr. Greaver do this to you?

435
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,636
- I'm scared.
- I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

436
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,673
Come on. Here we go.

437
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,959
- We should go back.
- It's all right.

438
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,868
Help! Help, he's taking me. Help!

439
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,231
- It's all right. Okay? Please.
- Mr. Kady, let go of the child.

440
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,590
They're abusing her.
She's got marks on her face.

441
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,553
Mr. Kady, let go of the child.
She's been through enough.

442
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,518
- You can see that for yourself.
- Help me! Help me.

443
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,558
- There, there, child. It's all right now.
- Help me.

444
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,280
- Sheriff, you can't let this happen.
- I'm not.

445
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,113
Take the child inside, Mildred.

446
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,276
I have to speak with Mr. Kady.

447
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:17,076
Mr. Kady, Amanda Jacobs
may only be 12 years old...

448
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,754
...but she has the fever.

449
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,116
- What fever?
- The only kind that matters.

450
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,114
Like I said before: Talking crazy,
thinking everyone's out to get you.

451
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,436
That our little town
isn't as perfect as it is.

452
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,751
No one knows exactly
why it happens, but it's easy to spot.

453
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,559
A look in the eye, like an animal
backed into a corner.

454
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,992
Eventually they try to run, but we
try to stop them before God does.

455
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,549
- What are you talking about?
- As long as we can remember...

456
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,393
...Mr. Kady, God punishes
those that try to leave.

457
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,513
Are you saying...

458
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,510
...that everyone that wants to leave
Rockwell Falls has this fever?

459
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,393
It's a sickness, Mr. Kady,
born from a lack of faith...

460
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,235
...and my methods
are the only successful means...

461
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,477
...to bring them back into the
population. We have to try to help.

462
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,710
- That's insane.
- What's insane is why anyone...

463
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,309
...would want to leave in the first place.

464
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,238
Well...

465
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,918
...if there is something
wrong going on here...

466
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,877
...I'm gonna have to report it.

467
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,593
Jeez, I'm sorry to hear that,
but we've got nothing to hide.

468
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,869
How are you feeling, Mr. Kady?

469
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,792
You look a little peaked.

470
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,911
Get the sheriff
to give you a lift.

471
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,991
You look like
you could use some rest.

472
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,598
That's okay.

473
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,273
I'll walk.

474
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,112
Hello, Mr. Kady.

475
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,279
Beautiful day, Mr. Kady.

476
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,559
- Hello, Mr. Kady.
- How do you do, Mr. Kady?

477
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,550
- Good day, Mr. Kady.
- Hi there, Mr. Kady.

478
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,718
<i>Hello, Mr. Kady.</i>
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

479
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,558
It doesn't look like your friend
is gonna make it today.

480
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,870
You sure he knows where we are?

481
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,552
Yeah, I told him.

482
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,838
Maybe he found
something better to do, huh?

483
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,992
Maybe he just forgot.

484
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,554
Yeah, that could be it.

485
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,676
You know what's going on
with Amanda Jacobs, don't you?

486
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,791
- You don't know what it's like here.
- Then tell me. Please.

487
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,956
They think that I'm dangerous
because I don't like it here.

488
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,509
But not to them. To myself.

489
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,439
They've tried to kill my spirit.
I keep my thoughts close...

490
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,716
...where they can't find them,
all the while...

491
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,151
...just hoping for a chance to leave.

492
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,793
Like Amanda.

493
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,032
- I've gotta find her.
- No, don't. Steve, it's too dangerous.

494
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,949
Bobby, you know, some people are
starting to whisper about them two.

495
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,315
Stop it, Christian.

496
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,156
He wouldn't do that.

497
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,469
He's my friend.

498
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,910
Still, I wouldn't wait too much longer
to ask Courtney to marry you.

499
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,997
Tomorrow, everyone
will be at the festival.

500
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,236
You just... You go there, you let
everyone see that you're okay.

501
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,719
And then you just slip away.

502
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,758
I can't just sit here
and wait and do nothing.

503
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,275
If you go now, you'll only
put her in more danger.

504
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,349
If they figure out what you're doing,
they'll just take her somewhere else.

505
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,991
Steve...

506
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,436
...stay with me.

507
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,076
I don't belong here.

508
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,878
This isn't... This isn't right.

509
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,715
Just promise me
that you will take me with you.

510
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,397
I promise.

511
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,070
Hey, Steve-O.
What happened to you yesterday?

512
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,074
Thought we were going shooting.

513
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,030
That's right. You know,
I completely forgot, Bobby. I'm sorry.

514
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,312
Hey, Steve. Come on, let's dance.

515
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,918
Boy, that's some friend
you got there, Bobby.

516
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,151
Shut up, Christian.

517
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,710
- What was that all about?
- I really need to talk to you...

518
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,112
...but everybody's watching us.

519
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,278
Past the woods there's a cabin...

520
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,115
...about a half mile in.
And if you're in trouble, you find it.

521
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,638
- What?
- Courtney.

522
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,268
Come stand with your mama.

523
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,478
Find it.

524
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,150
Gather around, everyone.
Gather around.

525
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,392
Is everyone here?
Minus the notable exceptions:

526
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,235
Amanda, the Sydes,
the Hillenbocks?

527
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,029
Well, that should be everybody, then.

528
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,230
We give you thanks,
almighty Father...

529
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,039
...for bringing new friends
to the community.

530
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,917
We give you thanks,
O Lord our God.

531
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,395
Solidarity and steadfastness.
We are the union of the divine...

532
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,079
...and we shall cherish
equilibrium and peace.

533
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,190
All right, enjoy yourself, everyone.

534
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,679
I can't believe this is
the second one this year.

535
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,515
Would have had a third if
Ray Jacobs hadn't done what he did.

536
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,635
How often do you
have these festivals?

537
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,114
- It depends.
- On what?

538
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,157
The population, of course.

539
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,392
Why, we're having
this one because of you.

540
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:53,156
Didn't you know? You make 437.

541
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,877
I'm so happy and blessed.
Thank you for this.

542
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,429
Don't forget to restart
your clocks until next time.

543
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,750
Now, let's try to finish off Sadie's pies
there. She's put a lot of love in them.

544
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,953
Are you out of your minds?

545
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,510
Doc, looks like we've got a live one.

546
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,910
Are you all
out of your fucking minds?!

547
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,436
How you doing there, Steve?
Why don't you come along with us.

548
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,634
It's okay, Steve-O.
The doctor can help.

549
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,950
Run! Run!

550
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,432
Keep him still.

551
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,352
No. Don't hurt him, please!

552
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,750
Why would we hurt him?
We're concerned about his health.

553
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,919
He's got the fever. He wants to run,
just like you wanted to before.

554
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,430
- He's not sick! You are! All of you!
- You don't know what you're saying.

555
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,318
- Take it back.
- I won't.

556
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,708
- It's evil!
- Come on.

557
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,998
- Help her. Take her to Doc Greaver.
- No! No!

558
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,991
No!

559
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,318
Very good.

560
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,358
How are you feeling, son?

561
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,753
Don't be embarrassed, Mr. Kady.
We've seen it all before.

562
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,036
You killed her.

563
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,156
You killed that poor woman.

564
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,197
Her name was Ruby Flynn.

565
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,076
And Ruby was honored to sacrifice
herself for the good of the community.

566
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,196
We can't help you understand
until you lie still.

567
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,915
Back in 1860, the population
of Rockwell Falls was 436.

568
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,675
And the town was
happy and prosperous.

569
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,035
But then a wicked man
came to town...

570
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,873
...and his wickedness
spread amongst the community...

571
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:08,717
...until God wiped
the cancer clear out by fire.

572
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,193
Seymour Grateman,
my great-grandfather...

573
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,998
...he rebuilt the town.

574
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,711
And he established a moratorium
on the population: 436.

575
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,156
And that number obviously
pleased our Father because...

576
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,869
...well, we guard it to this very day.
- It's God's law.

577
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,679
But I didn't move here.
I'm going home to Chicago.

578
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,114
I have a home.

579
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,312
We believe in our ways, Mr. Kady.

580
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,393
But we don't suppose
the outside world would understand.

581
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,676
We know we've been chosen...

582
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,798
...just as you were.
- That's what your fever is.

583
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,679
You give subversion
a name and then you cure it?

584
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,638
Mr. Kady, we did not
create the fever.

585
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,678
You're having a spell now.
Can you feel that rage and anger?

586
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,752
- That's not what God intended.
- We must save you from yourself.

587
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,037
Believe us, Mr. Kady, everyone
who tries running ends up dying.

588
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,158
Not by our hands, but by God's.

589
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,754
People will be looking for me.

590
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,713
That's all right.
We have taken care of that.

591
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,399
What does that mean?

592
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,674
You'll learn to love it here,
Mr. Kady, like everyone.

593
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,149
I'm not staying here!
Do you hear me?

594
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,356
- Doc.
- I am not staying here!

595
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,679
God! No, don't! No!

596
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,312
- Don't! Please!
- It's for your own good, Mr. Kady.

597
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:33,478
No, don't! Please! Don't!

598
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,999
You'll see a bright light...

599
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,628
...and it feels like you're dying,
but don't worry.

600
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,439
No! No. No.

601
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,715
Solidarity and steadfastness.

602
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,315
We are the union of the divine.

603
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,237
We shall cherish
equilibrium and peace.

604
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,157
<i>Dear Frank:</i>
<i>My life has changed here.</i>

605
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,713
<i>I've found a new home. Send regards</i>
<i>to everyone and arrange...</i>

606
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,599
<i>... to take what you want</i>
<i>from my place and my office.</i>

607
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,151
<i>Tell the boss I'll send</i>
<i>the reports soon. Thanks. Steve.</i>

608
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,393
<i>Hi, you've reached Steve.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

609
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,754
Easy, honey. You're fine.

610
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,390
You were having a nightmare,
but those will go away soon.

611
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,919
You're running a little hot
but you'll be fine. Don't worry.

612
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,230
Mr. Kady. Stop.

613
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,389
Get me the sheriff.

614
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,189
Thattaboy.

615
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,669
That's it.

616
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,589
Watch yourself.

617
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,272
Hey, boy!

618
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,873
Where you going?

619
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,309
Why didn't you go, Steve?

620
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,229
Get out of the car. Now.

621
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,274
It doesn't run.
They parted it years ago.

622
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,477
Even if it did, you can't get away.

623
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,993
Who are you?

624
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,718
My name is John Green.

625
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,512
I came here eight years ago.

626
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,910
I also thought
I was just passing through.

627
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,432
You do what I say.

628
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,313
You have to be one of them.
Do you understand?

629
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,789
You have to be one of them.

630
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,272
Come here, boy.

631
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,113
Hey.

632
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,436
- You looking for Mr. Kady?
- He's not doing good.

633
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,959
We need to get him some help.

634
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,152
You got it all wrong.
I invited him up a few days ago.

635
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,431
If you don't believe me, sheriff,
come on.

636
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,313
Steve!

637
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,192
I'd like to have a word with you.

638
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,633
- What seems to be the trouble?
- About to ask you the same.

639
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,153
Belma called.

640
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,234
She said you ran from her place.

641
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,950
My God, I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

642
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,031
- I had a strange feeling...
- He's lying.

643
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,435
Give him a chance.
He's been a straight arrow.

644
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,158
Even forgave my son, Curly.

645
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,953
Steve.

646
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,750
Do you understand how things
work around here?

647
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,070
I sure do, sheriff.

648
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,879
I understand how important
God's laws are.

649
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,510
That's why everything
is so... So peaceful.

650
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,270
It's what God intended.

651
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,150
Temperature's running high,
but he seems fine.

652
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,675
May have been a spell.

653
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,594
Be more careful next time. You don't
want us getting the wrong impression.

654
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,598
- It won't happen again. I promise.
- Thattaboy.

655
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,472
Why don't you come back with us.

656
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,949
It's lunch. I'm sure
Belma's cooking up something.

657
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,590
Give us a minute.
I want him to say bye to the kids.

658
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,716
They took a liking to him.

659
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,392
There must be a way out.

660
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,039
What are you so afraid of?

661
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,952
That they're right.

662
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,429
Strange things happen
to anyone who tries to leave.

663
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,591
- I can't explain.
- Self-fulfilling prophecy.

664
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,751
You think something's
gonna happen, it will.

665
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,911
What about the delivery
trucks that come in?

666
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,350
They don't stay the night.
That's the difference.

667
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:55,071
Would you listen to yourself? If you buy
into this, you are as crazy as they are.

668
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,790
Look, I am getting out of here,
with or without your help.

669
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,837
Have you had the nightmares?

670
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,919
Maybe you can close your eyes
to all this...

671
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,951
...but I can't.

672
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,470
- He's gonna help me with my boat.
- We knew you'd come around.

673
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,429
Help me with the crops on Saturday.

674
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,832
Harmony's gonna have
the baby soon.

675
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,434
That will put us back at 437.

676
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,200
Some don't want another drawing,
so here's your chance.

677
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,593
Get rid of him.
Everyone will look the other way.

678
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,518
Then you do it.

679
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,111
I can't hurt nobody, Christian.

680
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,238
<i>Deputy Hecker,</i>
<i>Mr. Kady just left Belma's.</i>

681
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,630
<i>I want you to keep an eye on him.</i>

682
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,911
I'm on it, sheriff.

683
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,758
You know, you always were stupid,
Bobby.

684
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,630
And look where it's gotten you.

685
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,549
Belma said you called the house.

686
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,554
What do you want?

687
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,634
There's a secret road
past the old sinkhole.

688
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,791
It's how the delivery trucks
get in and out.

689
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,197
That kid Obie follows them
down the road.

690
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,351
Turn right just past the bridge.

691
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,278
There's a delivery today at 4.

692
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,834
<i>Deputy Hecker, he's walking up Main,</i>
<i>heading toward the hardware store.</i>

693
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,558
<i>I got him.</i>

694
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,638
- How you feeling, Mr. Kady?
- Just a spell, you know how it is.

695
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,713
Listen, do you have any kerosene?
Belma could use some for her burner.

696
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,757
Just a sec.

697
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,915
Welcome to Rockwell Falls.

698
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,435
No, Curly, that was a few days ago.

699
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,079
You mind if I head out the back?

700
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,356
- Go ahead.
- Thanks again.

701
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,915
I've been thinking
about what you said.

702
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,315
About being my friend and all.

703
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,111
I'm confused, Steve-O.

704
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,475
Stopped by the house
the other night...

705
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,756
...to finally ask Courtney
to marry me...

706
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,194
...and I stumbled up next to the barn.

707
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,155
You and Courtney
were already together.

708
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,909
- I'm sorry.
- Do you think I'm dumb? Is that it?

709
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,838
Think I'm some
stupid country boy...

710
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,150
...and you can take her
out from under my nose?

711
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,952
- No. I don't.
- God, it hurts so bad.

712
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,435
- Bobby, listen...
- You can't imagine how it hurts.

713
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,231
If you ever loved her...

714
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,153
...you will help me
get her out of here.

715
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,557
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

716
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,278
Please, give her a chance.

717
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,030
I just want this to go away.

718
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,948
I just want it to go away.

719
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,193
I just want it to go away.

720
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,600
Bobby, you don't mean that.
You don't mean that.

721
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,197
Put the gun down.

722
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,471
Put the gun down.

723
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,112
It's okay.

724
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,953
It's okay.

725
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,673
Please.

726
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,038
Come on.

727
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,277
I'm just all messed up inside.

728
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,755
This beer gets to my head sometimes.

729
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,399
I'm sorry, Bobby.

730
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,829
- Where's Mr. Kady? I saw him come in.
- Yeah, he left out back a while ago.

731
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,035
- It's a fire!
- Get down!

732
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,351
It's our garage!

733
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,791
Relax everyone, relax.

734
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,475
Jack? Jack, get a bucket brigade
going from that tower.

735
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,998
Bobby?

736
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,393
Bobby.

737
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,232
Bobby, you all right?

738
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,998
Bobby.

739
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,752
Greaver's.

740
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,150
He's going after Courtney.

741
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,952
I knew it. Come on.

742
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,714
- We are the union of divine.
- We are the union of divine.

743
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,475
- We cherish equilibrium and peace.
- We cherish equilibrium and peace.

744
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,349
Mr. Kady, you do not know
what you are doing.

745
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,553
Okay, up against the wall,
both of you.

746
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,354
Handcuff yourself to the radiator.

747
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,394
All right, where's Courtney?

748
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,199
She went home this morning,
doctor's orders.

749
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,596
Don't lie to me. Where is she?

750
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,397
Has anyone lied to you?

751
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,437
It's you who won't face the truth.

752
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,389
- Where's Amanda? Tell me.
- You can't help her.

753
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,113
- Where is she?
- Downstairs.

754
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,430
Oh, hello.
We weren't expecting company.

755
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,913
I'm getting you out of here.

756
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,275
- We don't have much time.
- But this is our home.

757
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,750
They haven't found anything
permanent for us, but we're ready.

758
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,309
We're doing much better now.

759
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,919
Amanda.

760
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,149
Amanda.

761
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,192
- It's okay.
- Dear, would you like...

762
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,794
...another fresh blueberry muffin?

763
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,718
Come on.

764
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,438
This way.

765
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,678
Oh, my God.

766
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,516
There they are. Over there.

767
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,751
He's going for the tow truck.

768
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,519
Get in there.

769
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,800
- Get down. Keys?
- Under the seat.

770
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,238
Wait here.

771
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,957
There you are.

772
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,595
I'm so glad you're okay.

773
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,430
It's gonna be all right.
I'm gonna get you out.

774
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,158
Why?

775
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,634
What?

776
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,398
I'm sorry you missed lunch.
It was lovely.

777
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,994
Oh, my God, no.

778
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,518
Come on, we gotta go.

779
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,271
Please, Steve.

780
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,079
Steve. It's too late.

781
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,991
She's been cured.

782
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,749
Get out of the car, Steve.

783
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,837
Stay down.

784
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,033
Don't do this, Bobby.

785
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,956
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

786
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,394
Shut up, Christian.

787
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,438
It's different now, Bobby.
He's got your gun.

788
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,678
Shoot him!

789
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,788
Goddamn it, Bobby,
if you won't do it, I will.

790
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,752
Jesus.

791
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,310
- Hi there.
- Hey.

792
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,994
- Seems I got a little tire trouble here.
- Oh, yeah?

793
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,357
Probably from the huge crater
in the road.

794
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,912
Listen, I'm on my way
to Rockwell Falls.

795
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,559
Looking for a friend of mine.

796
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,830
You must be Frank.

797
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,912
Mr. Kady mentioned you.
Nothing but nice things to say.

798
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,275
I'm afraid you just missed him.

799
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,000
No longer with us,
as of two days ago.

800
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,559
You're kidding me.

801
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:56,269
What a jerk. He made it seem like
he was gonna be out here a while.

802
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,796
I thought I'd check in on him,
see what the good life's all about.

803
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,791
Well, you're welcome
to come into town...

804
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,474
...have some of the world's
best apple pie if you like.

805
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,598
We're having a little celebration.
Plenty to eat and drink.

806
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,034
What's the occasion?

807
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,952
Rain, sent from heaven.

808
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,953
Put out a bad fire
a couple of days ago.

809
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,197
And Harmony Evans, local girl,
just delivered twins.

810
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,273
Oh, and Bobby, my deputy,
just got engaged to the love of his life.

811
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,954
- Sounds good. I'm hungry.
- All right.

812
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,317
Yeah, grab a couple of things.
I'll give you a ride.

813
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,157
That tow truck will be back
to pick up your car in just a bit.

814
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,357
- What about the rest of my stuff?
- We're real honest around here.

815
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,351
Never any crime in Rockwell Falls.

816
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,438
- Sounds nice.
- You'll love it.
