78

And it has a separate entrance

from the parking
area in the back.

Does the office share a wall
with the place next door?

Yeah, just one.

Absolutely.

my mayor hat on,

Is it beth's plastic surgery?

Beth had plastic surgery?

127
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:56,056
Well, she said it was
a breast reduction,

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,758
but it was definitely
a full-body lipo.

129
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,281
No doubt.

So is she married? Kids?

I'm not sure.

00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,480
A b&b. She's still
looking for a place.

160
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,482
Well, you know that my
sister-in-law marcia

safe for you?

You don't even know her.

00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:05,380
She seems nice.

167
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,715
I'll mention the apartment.

the right match for our town.

you out yet, carol?

You wanna grab lunch after?

178
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:30,784
Yeah, but not that
burger place on elm.

179
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,508
I yelled at them on Tuesday.

- What?

181
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:35,410

You have a really
nice place here, rude.

205
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:27,095
I can't believe I haven't
come over to introduce myself.

206
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:28,397
I'm April.

207
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,765
Nice meeting you.

208
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,732
I was just wondering

209
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:32,245
if you would pass out
some flyers for me?

210
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,269
Oh!

211
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:34,503
Yeah. Happy to.

212
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:35,571
Um...

213
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:36,438
Yeah.

214
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:37,918
Half the town spins
in my chair, so.

215
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:39,608
I noticed.

216
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:41,888
I heard that you might still
be looking for a place to live,

217
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:42,778
because my sister-in-law

218
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:45,380
just moved out of
our garage apartment.

219
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,493
Oh! I would love to see it.

220
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:47,961
Yeah, I'm staying at
this bed and breakfast

221
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,029
until I find a place,

222
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,118
but the innkeeper...

223
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:51,954
She has these, like, dolls...

224
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:53,755
Yeah. She brings them in here.

225
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:54,790
I trim their hair.

226
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,725
- Oh...
- She brings them in.

227
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:57,526
Right.

228
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,306
- That's really creepy.
- Yeah.

229
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,440
Okay, so I need to
get out of there.

230
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,184
- Mm-hmm. You do.
- Yeah.

231
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,205
- Hi.
- Hi!

232
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:12,041
Hi! Come on in. I'm sadie.

233
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,041
I'm nana.

234
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:15,277
Nice to meet you.

235
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,857
- Wow.
- Yeah. Welcome.

236
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,013
Welcome...

237
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:20,015
To dazzle & spin.

238
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,750
How do you drive these things?

239
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
Oh, boy.

240
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:27,155
I think it's just
you and me today.

241
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:30,359
Okay, let's stretch
our hips out.

242
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,099
[humming]

243
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:39,301
nana, you are my only student.

244
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:40,269
Why is it so hard

245
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:41,915
to start a new
business in this town?

246
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,707
The personalities in luton
definitely don't make it easier.

247
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:47,309
These are not wild folk.

248
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,677
Not yet anyway.

249
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:50,178
Ooh, I like the spirit.

250
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:51,546
Here, I'm going to help you.

251
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:52,848
Are you going

252
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:54,761
to the small business
meeting later?

253
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,485
You should.

254
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,653
In my experience,

255
00:08:57,688 --> 00:08:58,987
personal connections

256
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:01,223
are better than any
form of advertising.

257
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,624
Are you gonna go?

258
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,304
Do I look like
the sort of person

259
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:06,488
who would miss an
opportunity for free wine?

260
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:08,964
Certainly not.

261
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,237
What makes her think

262
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:18,273
that's an appropriate dress
to wear to a networking event

263
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:19,141
at a church?

264
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,576
People certainly
won't forget her.

265
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:24,457
Brian. Who is this
lovely creature?

266
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,762
Sadie, this is jim rogers...
Car dealership owner.

267
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,018
Wait. How does a lion greet
a new animal in the field?

268
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:30,552
I don't know.

269
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:31,987
Pleased to eat you!

270
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:34,890
Wow.

271
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,492
Hello, everyone!
Let's get started.

272
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:38,939
We have a new face. Welcome!

273
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:40,862
- [applause]
- seriously?

274
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:42,108
What? She could be a client.

275
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:43,576
Could you have
been more obvious?

276
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,533
I mean, really?

277
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:46,379
Why don't you tell us
about your business?

278
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:47,903
Thank you for inviting me.

279
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:49,037
Hi, everyone.

280
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,172
I'm sadie

281
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:51,106
and I own the new

282
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:53,186
health and fitness
center, dazzle & spin,

283
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,443
on high street.

284
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:56,678
She teaches pole dancing.

285
00:09:57,414 --> 00:09:58,480
[nana] carol!

286
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,915
What are you doing here?

287
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,928
Do you own a business
I'm not aware of?

288
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:05,988
I cover newsworthy events, nana.

289
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,622
Sadie's talking.

290
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,424
Carol is right.

291
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,427
I teach a combination of
dance and pole-ates...

292
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,503
Which is guaranteed
to make you sweat.

293
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,409
I'm feeling pretty warm already.

294
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,834
I also offer massage
and wellness coaching

295
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,536
for my clients who want a
different kind of sweat.

296
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:23,305
So here are my cards.

297
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,173
The first class is free.

298
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,289
Hope to see you there.

299
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,880
Thank you for that assist.

300
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,215
Of course.

301
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,149
I love carol,

302
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:37,953
but she can be very
carol sometimes.

303
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,067
I wanted to let you know
that the apartment is ready.

304
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:43,025
Oh, that's great!

305
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,192
Sadie, sadie.

306
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,660
This is minister preston.

307
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:46,962
Hi. I'm sadie.

308
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:48,174
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

309
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:51,033
In addition to sharing this
glorious space with us,

310
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,268
he also runs the luton gala.

311
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,703
It's the most important

312
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,406
community charitable
event of the year.

313
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,875
It's a small gathering
for a good cause.

314
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,644
But it's a great
networking event.

315
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,912
I'm all in.

316
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,827
That's great! How can I help?

317
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,794
[April] hey, I'm home.

318
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:08,483
[marty] you're home early.

319
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,819
How did the business mixer go?

320
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,021
Let me guess,

321
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:15,424
they burned the sexy
new girl at the stake?

322
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:16,459
Not yet.

323
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,361
[April] no. Sexy new
girl is our new tenant.

324
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:21,797
And they didn't use a stake,
they used my stripper pole.

325
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,932
Oh, that's good to hear.

326
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:25,378
[marcia] please
forgive my brother.

327
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:27,442
You're going to love
the new apartment.

328
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,037
Thanks.

329
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:30,105

330
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,806
Yes, please.

- Cocktails?
- Yes, please.

Yes. Make mine a double.

334
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,925
I'm trying to convince
your wife to try a lesson.

335
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,782
Are you gonna do it?

336
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:43,518
Do you think that I should?

337
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:45,120
Tread carefully, marty.

338
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:47,275
There are a lot of
knives in the kitchen.

339
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:50,665
No, I think you're perfect
just the way you are.

340
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,394
I agree.

341
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,062
April is spicy as is.

342
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:55,875
But, you know, these
lessons are not about need.

343
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,100
It's just about
wanting more in life.

344
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:01,803
If you change your mind,
I have a lonely pole.

345
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,004
You can try it out.

346
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,507
That's what marty said
to me on our first date.

347
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,476
[laughing]

348
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,444
alright, I'll try it one time.

Move with your butt.

- You try.
- No. No, no, no.

353

Around the pole.

354
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:22,224
You're gonna milk it.

355

Down and arch your back.

Hook my ankles. Do
I take a run at it?

00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,113
My face hurts from
smiling so much.

367
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:47,749
I do need to get you some
more clients, though.

368
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:50,285
I can't be your only client.

369
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
That would be incredible.

370
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:55,056
Well, people in my chair are
a very captive audience, so.

371
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,460
Yeah.

372
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,328
Oh, my goodness.

373
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,197
This was really fun.

374
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,298
I needed this.

375
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,493
Yeah. I needed this, too.

376
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,467
Right.

377
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,335
Let's do it again.

378
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,448
- One more time?
- One more time.

379
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:09,437
Come on!

380
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:11,072
Ow. I can't even stand up.

381
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,140
You were so close.

382
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,776
My muscles have atrophied.

383
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:23,752
[♪♪♪]

384
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:26,288
[sighs] okay.

385
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,091
This will work.

386
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:36,498
Right.

387
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:45,106
[♪♪♪]

388
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:56,618
ben!

389
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,954
Pick you up later, I guess.

390
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:02,791
Oh, he's coming over.

391
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:05,093
Don't be weird...

392
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:06,561
Don't be weird.

393
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:08,063
Don't be weird...

394
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:10,065
Ms. Martin, always a pleasure.

395
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,600
Oh, mr. Quinn!

396
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,795
I thought I told you,
you can call me carol.

397
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:14,936
Carol.

398
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,037
Gerald.

399
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,272
Gerald!

400
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:22,043
Funny, I never knew that was
your first name until now.

401
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,044
Nor did I.

402
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,312
[laughing]

403
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,548
[sighs]

404
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,951
I really enjoyed the
gazette this morning.

405
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:31,998
You know, without those
recipes in the back,

406
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:34,189
I'd be eating the
same thing all week.

407
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:36,058
Oh, that's so sweet of you.

408
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:38,627
A lot of those are from my
grandmother's recipe book.

409
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:39,761
Oh.

410
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:43,365
I should head inside.

411
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,966
Good luck with those numbers.

412
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,334
Right.

413
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:52,107
Oh, my god.

414
00:14:58,248 --> 00:14:59,281
[knocking]

415
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:06,354
[throbbing dance music playing]

416
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,826
[sadie] one more
time. Come on, guys.

417
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:15,063
Hip, hip, hip, hip.

418
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,498
And head!

419
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:17,966
Hip.

420
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,768
And to the other side.

421
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:20,769
And head.

422
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:21,703
[April] wait a second!

423
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:22,637
Carol! Carol!

424
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,906
I'm so sorry. Do we
have an appointment?

425
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,409
No, but what are
you doing in there?

426
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:30,705
It's so fun. You
have to try this.

427
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,214
Yeah, well, that's
never happening.

428
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,684
You know, it sure seems
business is picking up for her.

429
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,986
How did so many women
hear about her studio?

430
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,688
Did a little birdy tell them?

431
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,324
I'm not just your
eyes and ears, carol.

432
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,399
I am my own person,

433
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:44,459
and I happen to like her,

434
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:46,795
so, yes, I may have
mentioned it to a few people.

435
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,263
And before, you know,

436
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:49,898
you hear this from anybody else,

437
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
she's living in the
garage apartment.

438
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:56,538
Don't you think that's a bit
of a temptation for marty?

439
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:57,706
No, carol, I do not.

440
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,040
Why would that be an issue?

441
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:01,376
You don't know her.

442
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,844
Honey, I'm worried about you.

443
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,679
I'm going to head back there...

444
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,980
And you should come with me.

445
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:06,981
It's fun.

446
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:07,716
She's fun!

447
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,820
I don't sweat in public, April.

448
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:21,563
[♪♪♪]

449
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,231
you're incredible.

450
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,532
[sadie] incredible?

451
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:27,001
You're pretty
incredible yourself.

452
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,371
You run a thriving
real-estate business,

453
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,139
you find time to be mayor,

454
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,386
and you advocate for small
businesses like mine.

455
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,644
Well, your success
is my success.

456
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,881
I'm going to tell
everyone about tonight.

457
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,036
That means a lot to me.

458
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:44,386
[mayor] god, you have
the hands of an angel.

459
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:47,655
Well, they can take you
to heaven, mr. Mayor.

460
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,058
I mean, if you want.

461
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:52,093
Turn over.

462
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:54,863
Well, is there
anything else I can do

463
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,498
to make you happy, brian?

464
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:58,266
Hot stones?

465
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:01,970
I offer a variety of extra
services upon request.

466
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:05,440
What do people normally request?

467
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,709
I think you know.

468
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,846
Oh...

469
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:24,959
Cute.

470
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:26,594
[April] hi, petey.

471
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,762
Oh, hey, April.

472
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:28,596
Hey, sadie.

473
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:31,065
Any chance your
mom would consider

474
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,745
donating a gift certificate
to the luton gala?

475
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:33,835
My mom?

476
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:36,204
Well, I'd have to call her.

477
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,572
She's away on a retreat?

478
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:38,640
[April] still?

479
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:41,209
Wow, it smells amazing in here.

480
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:43,244
What is that and
how do I get it?

481
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:44,145
Ooh.

482
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,581
These are my famous muffins.

483
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,584
Wow. These are incredible.

484
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:51,753
How come I've never
tried these before?

485
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,822
I usually just make
them for my mom.

486
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:55,784
[sadie] these are so good!

487
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:57,637
- You have to sell these.
- Really?

488
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,226
Or better yet,

489
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,994
put them out on a cart,

490
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:01,774
so the smell will waft
across high street.

491
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,298
You'd be sold out every day.

492
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,567
And, listen, I
know these things.

493
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:06,712
I'm a muffin specialist.

494
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,636
[chuckles]

495
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:09,738
so am I.

496
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,906
[coughs]

497
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:14,509
because I bake muffins.

498
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:15,777
Mm-hmm.

499
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,979
See you later, muffin man.

500
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,148
- [petey] oh, yeah. See ya.
- They're good.

501
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,217
Bye, April. Bye, sadie.

502
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,453
The coconut is on the house.

503
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:26,554
Thank you!

504
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,737
[April] so, how's
the new place?

505
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:33,161
It's okay.

506
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:35,074
I thought it would be
nice to live alone,

507
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:36,509
but mostly, it just gives
you a lot more time to think.

508
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,599
Hmm.

509
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:39,334
And that's a bad thing?

510
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,869
Well...

511
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:44,016
Is there anything you
need to talk about?

512
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,184
Well, I really hate dating.

513
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,208
[April] oh.

514
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:49,344
I mean, it's like

515
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,456
I keep checking boxes

516
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,158
on things everyone thinks
I'm supposed to do,

517
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:54,102
but none of it's
making me happy.

518
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:57,085
Well, I think a lot of
people can relate to that,

519
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,798
and you certainly don't have
to have all of the answers...

520
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:00,188
Especially at once, right?

521
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:03,569
What do you say you come
over tonight for dinner?

522
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:06,728
Because we sure miss having you.

523
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:07,962
No, no, I'm fine.

524
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,209
- Honestly.
- Yeah?

525
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,233
More importantly,

526
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,346
what are you planning
for marty's birthday?

527
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,402
Oh!

528
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:17,705
No idea.

529
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,209
Can I have a 20?

530
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:22,577
Yeah.

531
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,323
I don't know how
April and everyone

532
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,181
has gotten so taken
with this woman.

533
00:19:27,317 --> 00:19:28,249
Why does it bother you so much?

534
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:30,485
My hair is suffering, ben.

535
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,386
You're jealous

536
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,655
that your one friend
made a new friend?

537
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,757
No!

538
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,925
I have excellent
instincts and I am very...

539
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,538
Mom, your instincts
are telling you

540
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:41,162
to be crazy judgmental?

541
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,931
She's literally a stranger.

542
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,833
I have known women
like her my whole life.

543
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,680
Women who have gotten
by on their looks

544
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:50,538
while the rest of us have
toiled to be taken seriously.

545
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:52,618
Grandpa told me he
gave you the gazette

546
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:53,374
as a graduation present.

547
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:56,077
I've seen<i> succession.</i>

Perfect.

Do you have any
special requests?

Is this what you had in mind?

Do you attend

Oh, not really.

Well, however you
connect to god.

Well, I'll drop off
the other auction items

I'm so sorry.

We don't have to do
anything, we can just talk.

She was great.

She would have been first
in line for your classes.

587
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,835
She wasn't close-minded.

588

around here can be.

She didn't walk into

will you go on a date with me?

Gerald, I would
like that very much.

616
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,364
Great.

617
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,633
I'll pick you up Saturday.

Finally!

621
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:07,078
Yes!

00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,546
When is the big date?

623
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:09,847
Saturday.

624
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,516
A whole week to imagine

625
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,496
all the horrible ways
it will go wrong.

626
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,453
Oh, carol, don't think that way.

627
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:18,122
I'm sure it will go wrong
in entirely unexpected ways.

628
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:20,892
Thank you for the confidence.

629
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,961
I've missed you.

630
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,696
I've missed you, too.

631
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,565
You know, I was thinking,

632
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,434
maybe I was too
quick to judge sadie.

633
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,437
Is this a trap?

634
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,739
No.

635
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:35,854
There's nothing wrong

636
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:39,410
with a woman taking
control of her sexuality...

637
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,390
Even if she does flaunt
it a bit too much...

638
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:44,615
But it's not like she's
doing anything illegal.

639
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:45,717
Exactly!

640
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:49,620
I should get to
know sadie better.

641
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,290
You have great taste in friends.

642
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,491
Maybe I'll like her.

643
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,474
I'm really happy with the
planning committee's work

644
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,699
and I want to thank
you all for jumping in

645
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:02,500
and helping to make this

646
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,069
one of the best
gala events ever.

647
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,485
And if there's no
further business,

648
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,074
we can just...

649
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,742
[sadie] I have something.

650
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:12,810
If we have time.

651
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,445
Sadie. Sure, come on up.

652
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,513
Okay. Thanks.

653
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,751
Thank you.

654
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,887
What if we thought bigger?

655
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,556
- Bigger?
- Bigger. Yes.

656
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,526
Every year, we donate
the silent-auction sales

657
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:31,062
to the same community
children's fund.

658
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,942
But what if we could
raise more money

659
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:35,533
and donate to more charities?

660
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,634
[lynn] I don't know.

661
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,881
Small is the way we've done
it since the beginning.

662
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,249
[sadie] and it
works beautifully,

663
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,173
but let's build upon it.

664
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,674
Like, for instance,

665
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,277
we could do a 50/50 raffle.

666
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,649
Carol?

667
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,317
Sadie is right.

668
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:56,220
Bigger is better.

How great it is that

Not just for the friendship,

00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:31,485
So, if you had a friend who
was doing something illegal,

848
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,597
would you turn them in?

849
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:34,421
I guess it depends.

850
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:37,224
Are they hurting people?

851
00:34:37,259 --> 00:34:38,158
Kind of?

852
00:34:38,194 --> 00:34:40,394
I mean, it would hurt
if they found out.

853
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:47,668
Then I'd probably let it slide.

854
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:48,836

00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,976

00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,179

860
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:00,614
You're a good person.

861
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:01,114
If your heart tells
you something is wrong

862
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:02,816
and you ignore it,

863
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,463
it's just going to keep
getting louder and louder,

864
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,567
and then you'll know
what you have to do.

865
00:35:06,622 --> 00:35:07,521
But until then,

866
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:08,623
maybe just accept

867
00:35:08,657 --> 00:35:11,291
that people do things
that we don't approve of,

868
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,926
but we love them anyway.

869
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:15,362
Okay?

870
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:26,039

have you done it with?

871
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,141

872
00:35:28,177 --> 00:35:28,976

873
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:30,377
Oh, okay.

874
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:33,447
So you only have,
like, five customers?

875
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:35,749
Oh, no, we were counting
different things.

876
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:38,952
Oh!

877
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:41,188
So you've done it with
five people at once?

878
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,289
You can say sex.

879
00:35:42,424 --> 00:35:43,524
That's not a bad word.

880
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,525
And until we let go

881
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,204
of this puritanical
way of thinking,

882
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,839
society is never
going to evolve.

883
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:49,541
I mean, we can get
onboard with only fans,

884
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:50,998
but this is a problem?

885
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:52,232
Well, this is illegal.

886
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:54,334
It shouldn't be.

887
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
Okay, so who's your
typical customer?

888
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:59,306
Middle-aged, old, white dudes.

889
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:00,641
Have you seen this town?

890
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:02,287
Do you ever get
attached to these dudes?

891
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,289
I mean, sex is sort
of intimate, right?

892
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:06,046
It's not that intimate for me.

893
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:08,115
I just close that
part of myself off.

894
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,716
So...

895
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,731
I mean, what happens if
you start to like somebody?

896
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,733
Do you have romantic
relationships?

897
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:16,223
Boyfriends? Girlfriends?

898
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,424
I've tried.

899
00:36:17,526 --> 00:36:18,392
It doesn't really
work out so well.

900
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,060
People get jealous, so.

901
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,028
Hmm.

902
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:22,829
Well, it must be very hard

903
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:25,432
to open yourself up

904
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:28,902
you know, after you've been
so closed off for so long.

905
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:31,872
Relationships are overrated.

906
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:33,101
Are friendships overrated?

907
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:37,511
You know, you can't keep lying
and expect people to trust you.

908
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,853
I mean, that's not really
how friendships work.

909
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,081
Well, I wouldn't know.

910
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,483
I've been alone most of my life.

911
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:44,918
Well, not anymore.

912
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:48,522

913
00:36:50,893 --> 00:36:51,758

00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,235
[sadie] <i>what do
you want to see?</i>

916
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:04,438
<i>Who do you want me to be?</i>

917
00:37:05,841 --> 00:37:07,407
Ben?

918
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:08,542
Is everything okay?

919
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:11,678
Mr. Quinn said you
skipped out on mathletes.

920
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:12,746
I'm fine, mom.

921
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:14,581
Just tired.

922
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:15,782
Are you sick?

923
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:17,050
No.

924
00:37:17,086 --> 00:37:19,086
Honey, what are
you doing in there?

925
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:20,053
Don't come in!

926
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:21,366
I'm just doing my homework!

927
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,522
Leave me alone!

928
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,083
I'm just going to have a shower.

929
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:44,911
[water running]

930
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:54,721
[sadie] <i>I'll do
anything you want.</i>

931
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,058
There you go.

932
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
Thanks, daphne.

933
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,972
I haven't seen you in a
while. You must be busy.

934
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:02,956
I have to show you
both something.

935
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:05,999
Gird your loins.

936
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:08,935
Check this out.

937
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:12,739
<i>I'll do anything you want.</i>

938
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:16,410
She is selling
videos of herself,

939
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:18,412
doing things to herself.

940
00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:19,613
Wow.

941
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:22,349
Okay. Well, let's just take...

942
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,617
Take a deep breath here

943
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:24,451
and try and figure out

944
00:38:24,486 --> 00:38:25,830
why she might do
something like this.

945
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:28,155
I am not calming down, April!

946
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,790
My son saw her cookie!

947
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:31,491
I understand why you're upset.

948
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:32,993
I am upset about ben,

949
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:36,196
but I am also upset
on April's behalf.

950
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:38,266
Here. Look.

951
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,111
Look at the windows
in the background.

952
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:41,279
[April] it's my apartment.

953
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:42,736
Mm-hmm.

954
00:38:42,771 --> 00:38:44,905
She is filming
porn at your house.

955
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:48,175
Look, I don't love

956
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,510
that she is filming
at my apartment,

957
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:51,878
but, I mean, is it illegal?

958
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,146
It's not.

959
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:55,782
Okay, well, times are tough,

960
00:38:55,884 --> 00:38:57,195
maybe this is none
of our business

961
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:58,585
what she does to make money.

962
00:38:58,687 --> 00:38:59,753
None of our business

963
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:03,390
that she is filming secret
sex tapes in your rental?

964
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:04,492
I mean, clearly,

965
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,471
I'm gonna have to
get a cleaning lady.

966
00:39:06,495 --> 00:39:07,427
[laughing]

967
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:09,663
[carol] how are
you making jokes?

968
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:10,831
This isn't funny.

969
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,934
I'm worried about you and marty?

970
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,503
These are tapes of her alone...

971
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:18,805
What if she is filming
with other people?

972
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:22,042
What if she's bringing
strangers on to your property?

973
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:23,944
I've looked into her background.

974
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:25,523
She's never been
arrested or anything.

975
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:29,015
But she is a former stripper.

976
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:30,328
I can look into her
background, too.

977
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:32,219
Stripping is not illegal.

978
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:33,220
[April] I mean,

979
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:34,287
if ben saw this,

980
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:37,557
it will only be a matter of time

981
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:40,293
before the rest of
the town does, right?

982
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:42,273
Let's just explain to her
that this is not okay...

983
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,565
For her reputation and for us.

984
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:47,534
Oh, sure, April.

985
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:50,837
Why don't we just take
her out to brunch, too?

986
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:51,705
Over mimosas,

987
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,773
I can just ask her

988
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:56,610
to stop exposing her
vagina to my underaged son.

989
00:39:56,712 --> 00:39:57,110
Oh, my god, carol.

990
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:59,713
You know, I...

991
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,848
I don't want ben thinking

992
00:40:01,884 --> 00:40:04,718
that porn is what's
normal and sexy.

993
00:40:05,454 --> 00:40:07,788
I was never afraid to
have sex talks with him,

994
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,689
but this... this is different.

995
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:12,526
This is intense role-playing...

996
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:13,393
And it's someone he knows...

997
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:15,428
And it's just... it's not right.

998
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:16,863
It's not right,

999
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:19,666
but what sadie did
is not illegal.

1000
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,902
Give me a break.

1001
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:24,204
Maybe I will write
about her in the paper.

1002
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,374
I will talk to her and
ask her to stop filming.

1003
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,609
Yeah. Fine.

1004
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:31,411
Watch your back.

1005
00:40:31,547 --> 00:40:33,814
Who knows what she might
do with your husband.

1006
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:37,651
She clearly lacks boundaries.

1007
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,576
[sadie] squeeze
those buns, ladies.

1008
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:48,645
Up, and keep going! Up!

1009
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,981
We need to talk.

1010
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,085
Um, I'll be right back, ladies.

1011
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,189
What is it?

1012
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:01,224
Videos?

1013
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,693
You told me there
were no more secrets!

1014
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,161
I wasn't hiding the videos,

1015
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:06,674
so I didn't think
that was a secret.

1016
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:10,233
You said you didn't want
to hurt anyone, right?

1017
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,903
Well, carol's teenage son
has been buying your tapes.

1018
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:13,703
[groans]

1019
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,083
I bet that didn't go over well.

1020
00:41:15,107 --> 00:41:15,805
No.

1021
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:17,151
And then she got
daphne involved.

1022
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,953
I mean, you don't want to
get caught here, do you?

1023
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,017
Just take them down.

1024
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,078
I can't do that.

1025
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:22,257
That would be allowing
someone to shame me

1026
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:23,413
into hiding who I am.

1027
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:26,016
Well, then do it for me.

1028
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,051
Look, I am...

1029
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:30,720
I'm trying real hard here
to accept all of this,

1030
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:31,922
so meet me halfway.

1031
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:33,089
Okay.

1032
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,472
If it means that much to
you, I'll take them down.

1033
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:37,521
But I've got to
get back to class.

1034
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:44,968
Jim?

1035
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,274
Poor lynn.

1036
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,744
Lynn! Oh, god!
Where'd you come from?

1037
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,080
Have time for a quickie?

1038
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,315
No.

1039
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,749
I'm totally booked solid.

1040
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:00,951
Sorry.

1041
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:02,953
Please? For an old friend?

1042
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,554
A fellow cheer captain?

1043
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,534
Wow, you're really pulling
out all the stops, huh?

1044
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:07,324
I'll tell you what, lynn,

1045
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,670
why don't you come
back tomorrow?

1046
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,934
You can literally have
any appointment you want.

1047
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,340
How about just a little zhuzh?

1048
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,296
I'm going to the dealership.

1049
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:14,164
I'm going to talk to jim

1050
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,777
about the matching
grant for the gala.

1051
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:18,134
I'm wearing my power suit
and I need hair to match.

1052
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,469
Okay. A real quick one.

1053
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,722
So that sadie's a real
kick in the pants, huh?

1054
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:29,012
Oh, yeah.

1055
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:30,158
I love how she's
challenging us all

1056
00:42:30,182 --> 00:42:31,481
to think outside the box.

1057
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,016
Hmm.

1058
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,184
Me too.

1059
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,752
[thumping and banging]

1060
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,387
what is that?

1061
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:40,957
Um, sadie teaches
classes in her office.

1062
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:42,170
Right now, so they're probably

1063
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:43,026
doing jumping jacks,

1064
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,061
and squats, and
planks, and whatnot.

1065
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:46,964
Too funny.

1066
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,665
I thought it sounded like sex.

1067
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,266
Oh...

1068
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:51,668
Shows where my head's at.

1069
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,236
This is probably tmi,

1070
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,772
but jim has just been
voracious in bed lately.

1071
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,008
He wants it four or
five times a week now.

1072
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,175
We weren't doing it

1073
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,822
four or five times
a year before.

1074
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,012
[jim moaning]

1075
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:04,981
I don't know what changed,
but I wish I could bottle it!

1076
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,083
Lucky you!

1077
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:09,019
[jim moaning]

1078
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:11,554
play sex dong... song!

1079
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,557
Sex. Play song. Dong!

1080
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,327
Oh, my god.

1081
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:18,428
My friend, mary,

1082
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:21,765
says sadie's classes have
made her multi-orgasmic.

1083
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,566
Has that ever happened to you?

1084
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,101
[jim] oh!

1085
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:27,170
Stop music.

1086
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,885
- Oh, my god.
- Sorry!

1087
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:31,528
I'm thinking I should
start taking classes.

1088
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,055
Maybe sadie can teach this
old dog some new tricks.

1089
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,578
Is it hot in here?

1090
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:36,824
It's hot in here. You
know what, you're set.

1091
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:37,947
You look good.

1092
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,060
Can I use your ladies' room?

1093
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:40,517
Um, you know what, no. No.

1094
00:43:40,552 --> 00:43:41,562
It's all backed up.

1095
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,086
Wow.

1096
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:45,188
Who's done your highlights?

1097
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:46,656
You.

1098
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:47,991
She did a good job.

1099
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,096
Wait. Is that jim?

1100
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:53,963
[April] no.

1101
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:55,710
No, no, no. He's
at work, I'm sure.

1102
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,200
No, it is jim.

1103
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,413
I wonder what he's doing here.

1104
00:43:58,437 --> 00:43:59,235
I mean, no offense,

1105
00:43:59,438 --> 00:44:00,748
this isn't exactly
a happening area.

1106
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,072
Your salon,

1107
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:02,839
petey's...

1108
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,552
Nana's. There's
the flower shop.

1109
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:05,742
Nana's. You're right.

1110
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:08,044
It's our anniversary coming up.

1111
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,878
Aw!

1112
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,692
I don't wanna
spoil the surprise.

1113
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:11,948
Thank you for the hair.

1114
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,861
- What do I owe you?
- It's on me.

1115
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,363
Truly, your hair has
never looked better.

1116
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:16,553
Go, bulldogs.

1117
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:17,865
- Sisters for life.
- Go, bulldogs.

1118
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:18,955
Yup!

1119
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,427
[lynn] jim?

1120
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:25,595
Holy shit.

1121
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,097
[laughing]

1122
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:29,833
[sadie] that was funny.

1123
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,612
[April] what are
you doing here?

1124
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:32,802
It's family dinner night.

1125
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:33,837
Marcia couldn't make it,

1126
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,583
and you were working
late, so sadie cooked.

1127
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:36,607
Oh, how nice.

1128
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:39,642
She made this really
good spicy chicken dish.

1129
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:40,944
She's a really good cook.

1130
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:41,711
Oh, thank you!

1131
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:43,024
I saved you some.
You want some?

1132
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:44,180
I'm good.

1133
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:53,423
I'll get another bottle.

1134
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,098
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

1135
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,729
[sadie] is everything okay?

1136
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,066
Hey. It's me.

1137
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,236
Yeah, so, um,

1138
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:07,704
I think you're right.

1139
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,183
Although I was too
scared to admit it,

1140
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,709
I think there is
something off about her.

1141
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,011
You know?

1142
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,347
My gut says...

1143
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:22,685
That her massage clients
are paying her for sex.

1144
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:26,022
Mm-hmm.

1145
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:27,357
I don't know how much
she charges, carol.

1146
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,759
Why would I know that?

1147
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,495
Okay?

1148
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,097
Well, how much do you...

1149
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,965
Oh.

1150
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,536
She made spicy chicken.

1151
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,205
[carol] I knew it.

1152
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,374
I was right.

1153
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,177
An illegal prostitution
ring right under our noses.

1154
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,612
It isn't exactly a ring, carol.

1155
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:52,782
Has sadie confessed
what she's doing?

1156
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:53,783
Uh, no.

1157
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:56,219
Have you seen money
exchange hands?

1158
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,832
I mean, I've heard them talking.

1159
00:45:57,856 --> 00:46:00,723
And, you know, I may
have heard sex noises.

1160
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,192
Okay.

1161
00:46:02,294 --> 00:46:04,105
Let's not jump to
conclusions, okay?

1162
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:05,195
I mean...

1163
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,407
Infidelity is not a crime...

1164
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,232
And April is hearing all
of this through a wall.

1165
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,133
We need more than
that to get a warrant.

1166
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:13,503
Well, April could put
in a hidden camera...

1167
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:15,149
- No, no.
- That's not happening.

1168
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,684
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

1169
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:20,543
Look, I'm not on the clock...

1170
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,023
But we can start by
building a paper trail.

1171
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:23,213
Okay?

1172
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:25,235
To track them coming and going.

1173
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:27,691
- Wait. Is that wine?
- Mm-hmm.

1174
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,297
Seriously, we can't
drink wine in this park.

1175
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:31,354
Well, what are you gonna do?

1176
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:32,488
Call the police?

1177
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,390
It's yummy.

1178
00:46:34,426 --> 00:46:35,458
[laughs]

1179
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:37,205
look, I don't want to get
involved in this case.

1180
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,239
I have told you
what little I know,

1181
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,662
and that is the extent of it.

1182
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:40,897
[carol] well, fine.

1183
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,198
Then I will kick things off

1184
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:44,067
by making a formal complaint

1185
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:47,203
about my underaged son
purchasing her porn videos.

1186
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:50,006
The way I should have
from the beginning.

1187
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,853
Isn't there a way of
getting her to stop

1188
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:53,710
without having her arrested?

1189
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:56,246
I just... I think that
she is a good person.

1190
00:46:56,348 --> 00:46:57,313
I know it.

1191
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:00,283
She genuinely feels like
she's helping these men.

1192
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,663
But the law doesn't distinguish

1193
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:03,965
between good law
breakers and bad.

1194
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,589
You did the right
thing coming forward.

1195
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:09,393
[carol] you did.

1196
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:11,694
I did.

1197
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,695
[sadie] all right, ladies.

1198
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:14,397
Take your left leg,

1199
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:16,466
hook your knee,

1200
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:18,534
whip over,

1201
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,647
whip your head back up.

1202
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:20,637
That's it!

1203
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,550
All right, try it
again, try it again.

1204
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:23,873
Nana!

1205
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,476
Nice job with that head whip.

1206
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,411
That was sexy.

1207
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,680
No one can change
your life but you.

1208
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:33,283
Let's see, lynn.

1209
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:37,587
Oh, yes! I love
that head whip!

1210
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:38,721
That was beautiful.

1211
00:47:38,757 --> 00:47:41,190
I used to be a cheerleader
with April in high school.

1212
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:42,125
Well, that makes sense

1213
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,240
why you two can move
your bodies so well.

1214
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,497
Let's give your husbands
something to talk about tonight.

1215
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:49,198
Hallelujah!

1216
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:50,400
Seriously?

1217
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:51,668
Stop.

1218
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,078
Is everything okay?

1219
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,368
[April] this is too much.

1220
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:04,080
Let's regroup, everybody.
Come on, from the top.

1221
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:08,751
You want some more wine?

1222
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:12,516
- Honey?
- Hmm?

1223
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:14,223
Sorry, what?

1224
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:15,692
You're quiet today.

1225
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,460
Yeah, I'm...

1226
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,195
I'm just thinking.

1227
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,163
Are you worried about, sadie?

1228
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:22,632
Sadie? Why would I be
worried about sadie?

1229
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,000
Because of her videos.

1230
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:25,902
You know about those?

1231
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:29,305
Yeah, guys like to
gossip, too, you know?

1232
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:30,473
Have you seen them?

1233
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,408
No, as a general rule,

1234
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:33,988
I don't like to look at any
of your friends' vaginas.

1235
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,845
Oh. Good to know.

1236
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:39,522
Is that the criminal activity
that you were worried about?

1237
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,085
Because porn isn't illegal.

1238
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,197
I mean, sadie's cute,

1239
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:43,753
but she's not exactly
a criminal mastermind.

1240
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:45,555
You think she's cute?

1241
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:48,132
Not as cute as you.

1242
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:54,964
Come here.

1243
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:57,600
Hey, girl, what are you...

1244
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:58,401
Shh!

1245
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,356
Just come in and close the door.

1246
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:03,039
Sadie told me she's
taking money for sex.

1247
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,455
- So you lied...
- She directly confided in me.

1248
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:10,480
And, yes, I did lie.
Yes, I did. Sorry.

1249
00:49:10,582 --> 00:49:12,542
And why the sudden
change of heart?

1250
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:13,983
Jim rogers

1251
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:16,285
has been hanging around
the office a lot,

1252
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:18,454
and let's just say...

1253
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:19,689
He's not quiet.

1254
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,691
- Oh, god.
- Mm-hmm.

1255
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,192
And you saw him pay for sex?

1256
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:25,628
Would you touch jim for free?

1257
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:26,763
Hell no.

1258
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:27,830
There you go.

1259
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:30,299
I saw stacks of cash.

1260
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,702
I mean, it just needs
to be stopped, right?

1261
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:33,957
She needs to be stopped.

1262
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,245
And you're willing to make
an official statement?

1263
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:40,209
[moaning]

1264
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,813
I mean, what's official?

1265
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:46,483
Yeah.

1266
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:48,518
No. I don't know.

1267
00:49:52,173 --> 00:49:54,474
So, when is the raid happening?

1268
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:58,111
Alright, you didn't
hear this from me, okay,

1269
00:49:58,146 --> 00:49:59,245
tomorrow morning.

1270
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,680

1451
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:35,411
And the butchers,

1452
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,680
the baker, the
candlestick maker.

1453
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:39,048
And the tax guys.

1454
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,683
That's true.

1455
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:41,795
Been there, screwed that.

1456
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:42,885
[laughs]

1457
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:44,153
they need to take

1458
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,766
a long, hard look at themselves

1459
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:46,922
before they judge you.

1460
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,425
That's true.

1461
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:51,371
I need to talk to April, though.

1462
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:52,361
I have nowhere to go.

1463
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:54,463
Oh, you'll stay with me.

1464
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:56,732
Nana.

1465
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,412
What did I do to deserve you?

1466
00:58:58,436 --> 00:59:00,636
- Come on, come on.
- Thank you.

1467
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:01,905
[nana] you're welcome, dear.

1468
00:59:02,006 --> 00:59:04,807
[♪♪♪]

1469
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:06,308
allow me.

1470
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:11,380
Best table in the house.

1471
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:12,581
Wow.

1472
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:13,657
What's the occasion?

1473
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:16,085
I think you need to take
your mind off everything.

1474
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,370
Do you think
everyone here knows?

1475
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:39,441
Definitely.

1476
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:42,945
[sighs] okay.

1477
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,582
Are you okay?

1478
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:47,950
Mm-hmm.

1479
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:53,400
You know what, I need to
go to the ladies' room.

1480
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:54,356
Can you order for me?

1481
00:59:54,392 --> 00:59:55,457
Sure.

1482
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:05,612
[woman] I heard an
entire law firm in boston

1483
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:06,902
passed around her number.

1484
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:08,671
Talk about team building.

1485
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:09,983
[lynn] who knew our
fitness instructor

1486
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:11,440
was working so hard?

1487
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:12,475
[woman ] right?

1488
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,550
Shame, though, they
were good workouts.

1489
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:17,613
Your husband didn't...

1490
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:18,614
You know?

1491
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,282
Jim? No way.

1492
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:21,717
He's always busy at work.

1493
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:24,253
Besides, I would kill him...

1494
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:25,187
Slowly...

1495
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:27,122
With a frying pan.

1496
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:31,360
Hey, April!

1497
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:33,028
Can you believe it?

1498
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:35,364
That really was sex
we were hearing!

1499
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:36,399
Crazy.

1500
01:00:37,702 --> 01:00:40,035
Did you ever suspect?

1501
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:42,638
No. Not to that extent.

1502
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:48,722
I know you guys were friendly,

1503
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:51,380
so if you ever want to
talk, please give me a call.

1504
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:52,781
Thank you.

1505
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:57,186
Bye.

1506
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:58,221
<i>Good morning,</i>

1507
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:00,789
<i>I'm tricia murata with
lqrp morning news.</i>

1508
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:04,326
I'm here with carol martin
of the luton gazette.

1509
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,861
Thank you.

1510
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:06,962
Thank you, tricia.

1511
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:07,629
Last night,

1512
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,998
the luton police department

1513
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:10,399
released the first batch

1514
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:11,600
of 21 names

1515
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:14,503
from the client list
of sadie simpson...

1516
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,207
<i>The pole-dancing prostitute.</i>

1517
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:21,944
<i>It's worth reminding everyone
that these are pending charges.</i>

1518
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:25,881
<i>All mentioned names have the
presumption of innocence.</i>

1519
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:31,553
<i>I expect people will be
hurt by this publication...</i>

1520
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,357
<i>And to avoid confusion</i>

1521
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:38,327
<i>or false identifications...</i>

1522
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:42,965
<i>Because the people of luton
look after each other.</i>

1523
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:45,033
How does it feel

1524
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:47,936
to be making the names of
alleged johns public, though?

1525
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:49,772
Well, if you've done the crime,

1526
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:50,973
you do the time.

1527
01:01:56,647 --> 01:01:59,915
[♪♪♪]

1528
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:10,893
[♪♪♪]

1529
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:14,156
[carol] so you're not
talking to me anymore?

1530
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:17,477
You realize that everyone
hates me now, right?

1531
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:18,767
Or do you just not care?

1532
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:20,803
Of course, I care.

1533
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,938
My friends won't
even talk to me.

1534
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:24,918
Some of their dads
were on that list.

1535
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:25,841
I am sorry

1536
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:28,310
they are taking their
fathers' mistakes

1537
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:29,244
out on you.

1538
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,557
If you know it was
just a mistake,

1539
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:33,048
then why did you have to
ruin their lives like this?

1540
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,685
I am not responsible
for the choice...

1541
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,187
Ben! Ben!

1542
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:40,956
- Ben!
- Carol...

1543
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,111
I can't talk right now.

1544
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:43,470
You have to let me explain.

1545
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:45,027
No need.

1546
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:47,462
I understand how sex
with a stranger works.

1547
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:49,331
Okay. Wow.

1548
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,301
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

1549
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:53,101
you'll be happy to know

1550
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,236
that they've asked me to resign.

1551
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,573
It was not my intent for
you to lose your job.

1552
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,308
What exactly was your intent?

1553
01:03:00,578 --> 01:03:01,844
Don't make me the bad guy.

1554
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:04,980
There is no excuse
for what you did...

1555
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:06,615
And with her, of all people?

1556
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:09,384
It's so easy to judge
someone else, isn't it?

1557
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,586
I was lonely.

1558
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:13,589
And, yes, maybe I paid sadie
for a little human contact,

1559
01:03:13,691 --> 01:03:16,892
but that does not make
me a bad person, carol.

1560
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:19,541
Don't you think I get lonely?

1561
01:03:20,331 --> 01:03:21,797
I'm not made of stone.

1562
01:03:23,334 --> 01:03:24,334
Coulda fooled me.

1563
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:31,273
[April] I wasn't expecting you.

1564
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:35,016
There's been a lot of
tears in this salon today.

1565
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:41,169
Um, could you just
excuse us for a second?

1566
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:47,656
What's going on?

1567
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:50,826
The next set of names
are about to be released.

1568
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,097
Marty's name is on the list.

1569
01:03:56,634 --> 01:03:58,594
We're going to
have to charge him.

1570
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:02,070
I'm so sorry.

1571
01:04:07,394 --> 01:04:08,327
How could you do this?

1572
01:04:08,362 --> 01:04:13,098
April, it's not what you think.

1573
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,511
So things were only
better between us

1574
01:04:14,535 --> 01:04:19,371
because you were having
sex with sadie here.

1575
01:04:19,473 --> 01:04:20,617
April, no, you don't understand.

1576
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:21,840
In our bed.

1577
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:22,908
Here.

1578
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:24,788
That's why you weren't
on the security tapes,

1579
01:04:24,812 --> 01:04:25,812
isn't it?

1580
01:04:25,913 --> 01:04:26,923
Do you really think
that I would do that?

1581
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:27,746
You let me...

1582
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,550
You let me run
around like a fool,

1583
01:04:31,585 --> 01:04:33,585
knowing that you
were on that list.

1584
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:36,214
Did you want to
get caught, marty?

1585
01:04:37,057 --> 01:04:38,857
I don't understand.

1586
01:04:38,892 --> 01:04:39,858
- Listen...
- I don't understand.

1587
01:04:39,893 --> 01:04:41,004
- Listen, listen.
- No.

1588
01:04:41,028 --> 01:04:43,528
All I need you to know
is that I love you.

1589
01:04:43,564 --> 01:04:44,997
Oh, bullshit. Bullshit.

1590
01:04:45,032 --> 01:04:46,999
Get out of the house.

1591
01:04:47,034 --> 01:04:47,966
- April.
- Go.

1592
01:04:48,002 --> 01:04:48,900
Please.

1593
01:04:48,936 --> 01:04:50,113
You know what, that's
fine, I'll leave.

1594
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:53,372
April, please listen
to me. I can explain.

1595
01:04:54,274 --> 01:04:55,240
[daphne] <i>if sadie's
ledgers are correct,</i>

1596
01:04:55,275 --> 01:04:58,343
<i>she made upwards
of $100,000 cash.</i>

1597
01:04:58,445 --> 01:05:03,115
But her tax returns
only claimed $18,232.00.

1598
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:05,117
This is bad.

1599
01:05:05,252 --> 01:05:07,252
This is mandatory jail time.

1600
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:09,499
<i>The release of the names</i>

1601
01:05:09,523 --> 01:05:12,157
has really turned
luton upside-down.

1602
01:05:13,127 --> 01:05:14,092
People in my line of work

1603
01:05:14,128 --> 01:05:17,963
are threatened and
blackmailed all the time.

1604
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:19,898
Having those records

1605
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,100
is an important
insurance policy.

1606
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:24,748
An unfortunate one
for the rest of us.

1607
01:05:24,772 --> 01:05:26,104
It's part of the business.

1608
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:28,306
The truth is

1609
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:30,308
my clients upended
their own lives.

1610
01:05:30,411 --> 01:05:32,577
They are responsible
for the consequences

1611
01:05:32,613 --> 01:05:33,613
as much as I am.

1612
01:05:35,215 --> 01:05:37,175
So they simply
fell to temptation?

1613
01:05:37,918 --> 01:05:39,217
I didn't force anyone.

1614
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:44,701
You misunderstand me.

1615
01:05:44,725 --> 01:05:45,524
I'm...

1616
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:48,827
Jesus didn't judge
mary magdalene.

1617
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,529
I'm not blaming you.

1618
01:05:51,398 --> 01:05:53,398
I think I'd feel
better if you did.

1619
01:05:57,104 --> 01:05:59,404
People may regret

1620
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,839
that their loved ones

1621
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:02,941
found out about
their indiscretions.

1622
01:06:04,111 --> 01:06:07,846
But I don't believe they regret
the time they spent with you.

1623
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,050
I know I don't.

1624
01:06:15,255 --> 01:06:16,054
I pray that I will be able

1625
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:18,356
to continue on with
this community.

1626
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:22,661
But I await my judgement
with an open heart.

1627
01:06:24,331 --> 01:06:26,631
When my name comes up in print,

1628
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,934
rest assured, I will
blame no one but myself.

1629
01:06:37,377 --> 01:06:39,544
I didn't put your
name on the records.

1630
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:53,792
Hey.

1631
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:56,862
- Can I get a coffee?
- Sure.

1632
01:07:01,502 --> 01:07:02,734
Do you think I'm a kid?

1633
01:07:03,737 --> 01:07:04,402
Sorry?

1634
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:06,471
You knew what sadie was doing

1635
01:07:06,573 --> 01:07:08,373
and you didn't tell me.

1636
01:07:09,576 --> 01:07:10,876
Uh... So?

1637
01:07:10,911 --> 01:07:12,711
So, I would have liked

1638
01:07:12,746 --> 01:07:14,190
to have been her
client or something.

1639
01:07:14,214 --> 01:07:16,281
Okay...

1640
01:07:16,383 --> 01:07:17,449
So you're angry

1641
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:19,129
because you didn't get a
chance to sleep with her?

1642
01:07:19,153 --> 01:07:20,519
Obviously. Yes.

1643
01:07:22,156 --> 01:07:23,355
Thank you.

1644
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:25,323
Has this whole town gone crazy?

1645
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:30,630
[knocking on door]

1646
01:07:30,664 --> 01:07:31,930
[tricia] April?

1647
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,000
April, it's tricia from lqrp.

1648
01:07:35,102 --> 01:07:36,701
I just want to talk to you.

1649
01:07:36,737 --> 01:07:37,869
April!

1650
01:07:41,742 --> 01:07:43,441
Wait.

1651
01:07:43,577 --> 01:07:44,543
[April] <i>well, I'm
embarrassed to say</i>

1652
01:07:44,578 --> 01:07:47,179
<i>that prior to this,</i>

1653
01:07:47,214 --> 01:07:49,014
<i>I considered her a friend,</i>

1654
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:50,827
<i>but what she has done
to this community</i>

1655
01:07:50,851 --> 01:07:53,652
<i>is both amoral and indefensible.</i>

1656
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:56,588
<i>Sadie smith is a parasite.</i>

1657
01:07:57,658 --> 01:07:58,802
<i>And she came to this town</i>

1658
01:07:58,826 --> 01:07:59,958
<i>and used us all</i>

1659
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:03,495
<i>for her financial and
sexual gratification.</i>

1660
01:08:07,868 --> 01:08:08,978
How are you holding up?

1661
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:12,470
I'm, like, two seconds away
from a nervous breakdown.

1662
01:08:12,573 --> 01:08:13,705
Sounds about right.

1663
01:08:15,075 --> 01:08:16,341
These are serious charges.

1664
01:08:17,377 --> 01:08:18,610
I have a recommendation.

1665
01:08:18,712 --> 01:08:20,078
You're not going to like it.

1666
01:08:21,315 --> 01:08:22,826
The d.A. Has
offered a plea deal,

1667
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,449
and I think you should take it.

1668
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,451
Are you kidding?

1669
01:08:26,486 --> 01:08:27,652
No one got hurt.

1670
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:29,988
Everyone was a consenting adult.

1671
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,957
The prostitution aside,

1672
01:08:31,992 --> 01:08:32,924
the state's going to
want their pound of flesh

1673
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,492
for the tax evasion...

1674
01:08:34,595 --> 01:08:36,306
No matter how
strong our defense.

1675
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:37,562
So I go to jail

1676
01:08:37,598 --> 01:08:38,396
and then everyone else

1677
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:40,043
goes back to their
safe, little lives

1678
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:42,067
like nothing ever
happened, right?

1679
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:43,102
Basically.

1680
01:08:50,444 --> 01:08:51,076
[door opens]

1681
01:08:51,245 --> 01:08:53,011
how could you do this to me?

1682
01:08:53,113 --> 01:08:55,480
The cops ransacked
your apartment,

1683
01:08:55,616 --> 01:08:57,193
I packed up whatever was left

1684
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:59,517
and put it on the curb.

1685
01:09:01,088 --> 01:09:02,665
And then I ran over
it with my car.

1686
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:04,623
You were my best friend.

1687
01:09:06,827 --> 01:09:07,559
You're questioning my friendship

1688
01:09:07,661 --> 01:09:09,594
after you slept with my husband?

1689
01:09:09,696 --> 01:09:11,129
What?

1690
01:09:11,164 --> 01:09:13,465
You think that I
would do that to you?

1691
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,799
Or to marty?

1692
01:09:14,835 --> 01:09:17,235
I think that you
are broken inside!

1693
01:09:17,337 --> 01:09:18,303
Alright?

1694
01:09:18,338 --> 01:09:19,883
I think you cannot have
a real relationship,

1695
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:21,006
or kids,

1696
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:22,874
or connections with people.

1697
01:09:22,976 --> 01:09:24,109
Because I tried...

1698
01:09:24,144 --> 01:09:25,443
And look what it's gotten me.

1699
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,358
The only thing you tried
was to steal my husband.

1700
01:09:28,382 --> 01:09:29,481
Why?

1701
01:09:29,516 --> 01:09:32,317
Because you were jealous of
my relationship with marty?

1702
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:33,351
No. No, no, no.

1703
01:09:33,387 --> 01:09:34,864
You knew exactly who I
was and you loved it.

1704
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:36,588
It felt dangerous

1705
01:09:36,657 --> 01:09:38,823
and it felt fun to be my friend.

1706
01:09:38,859 --> 01:09:40,169
You were never a victim, April.

1707
01:09:40,193 --> 01:09:42,594
None of this made it okay!

1708
01:09:42,629 --> 01:09:43,995
You used us...

1709
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:44,863
And I defended you,
I defended you...

1710
01:09:44,932 --> 01:09:47,732
You turned me in!

1711
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:49,401
It was bullshit!

1712
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:51,247
You're just like everyone
else in this fake town

1713
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:52,437
with your fake smiles

1714
01:09:52,472 --> 01:09:54,773
and your fake friendships.

1715
01:09:54,808 --> 01:09:57,142
Accusing us of being fake...

1716
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,510
That's rich.

1717
01:09:58,545 --> 01:09:59,177
You used us.

1718
01:09:59,212 --> 01:10:01,313
You collected us one by one

1719
01:10:01,348 --> 01:10:04,616
to support and protect
your business...

1720
01:10:04,685 --> 01:10:05,517
I don't know...

1721
01:10:05,552 --> 01:10:07,352
If you can call it that!

1722
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:09,921
You were my friend, April.

1723
01:10:10,857 --> 01:10:12,757
Not anymore.

1724
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:15,126
You're just a whore

1725
01:10:15,162 --> 01:10:16,628
who breezed into town

1726
01:10:16,663 --> 01:10:18,330
and destroyed everyone's lives.

1727
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:24,402
I hope you rot in jail.

1728
01:10:39,169 --> 01:10:40,635
Okay.

1729
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:43,104
Let's just deal with the
elephant in the room here.

1730
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,739
Sadie rolled into town,

1731
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:47,542
she dazzled and spinned
us into submission,

1732
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,911
and then she slept with our men.

1733
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,780
Well, now she's off to prison.

1734
01:10:51,882 --> 01:10:53,982
She got what she deserved.

1735
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:55,328
How could she look me in the eye

1736
01:10:55,352 --> 01:10:57,218
after sleeping with my husband?

1737
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,174
And she charged you for classes.

1738
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:00,755
That's messed up.

1739
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:02,457
I just feel so stupid.

1740
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:05,427
You know? I mean, I...

1741
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:06,995
I promoted her business,

1742
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,941
thinking that she
cared about us,

1743
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:10,098
cared about our town.

1744
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:11,144
[carol] good riddance.

1745
01:11:11,168 --> 01:11:12,467
I think it's best

1746
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,869
if we all just get
on with our lives.

1747
01:11:14,905 --> 01:11:17,439
Let our town get back to normal.

1748
01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:20,175
There is no normal after this.

1749
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:22,344
Oh, you are all crybabies!

1750
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:25,280
Your partners and husbands

1751
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:27,048
sought sexual gratification

1752
01:11:27,084 --> 01:11:29,784
with someone totally
out of their league.

1753
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:30,785
Most men would.

1754
01:11:30,821 --> 01:11:33,188
And from what I heard,

1755
01:11:33,223 --> 01:11:35,523
you got the benefit
of the lessons.

1756
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,460
Even if it came with
a heap of trouble.

1757
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,096
Damn whiners.

1758
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,801
I'm gonna miss that class.

1759
01:11:51,942 --> 01:11:54,062
Should we even go
through with this gala?

1760
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:02,751
[brian] knock-knock.

1761
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:04,486
I'm really not in the mood.

1762
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:08,823
This isn't how I expected
things to turn out, sadie.

1763
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:11,559
How did you expect
things to turn out

1764
01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:13,962
when you were referring
all of your friends to me?

1765
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:17,098
You all had an itch, you
were happy to scratch it.

1766
01:12:17,134 --> 01:12:17,966
You're right.

1767
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:21,169
And I have to step
down from office.

1768
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:24,052
Do you see what's
happening here, brian?

1769
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,375
My name and face is
all over the news.

1770
01:12:27,411 --> 01:12:30,512
I am trending online.

1771
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:31,946
I will forever be known

1772
01:12:32,082 --> 01:12:34,949
as the "pole-dancing
slut from luton".

1773
01:12:36,153 --> 01:12:38,586
You get a misdemeanor
and a $100 fine.

1774
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:41,589
I am facing felony charges

1775
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:43,525
and the possibility of prison.

1776
01:12:44,928 --> 01:12:45,693
That's kind of a
double standard,

1777
01:12:45,762 --> 01:12:48,163
don't you think?

1778
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,500
I think we all need to take
a long look in the mirror.

1779
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,181
[door opens]

1780
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:07,415
oh.

1781
01:13:07,451 --> 01:13:10,185
- Marty didn't do anything wrong.
- Just stop, marcia, please.

1782
01:13:12,022 --> 01:13:13,788
April, listen.

1783
01:13:13,824 --> 01:13:16,357
M. Macintosh was the
name on that list.

1784
01:13:17,294 --> 01:13:19,227
Me. Marcia macintosh.

1785
01:13:19,262 --> 01:13:20,895
I slept with sadie.

1786
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:26,901
Wait a minute. What?

1787
01:13:26,937 --> 01:13:28,002
You mean you're...

1788
01:13:28,038 --> 01:13:29,571
Gay. Yeah.

1789
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:31,940
Evidently, I had to hire
a prostitute to be sure.

1790
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:34,676
Worst coming-out story ever.

1791
01:13:36,213 --> 01:13:37,323
Did sadie pressure you?

1792
01:13:37,347 --> 01:13:38,780
No.

1793
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,781
The opposite.

1794
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:43,451
It was unlike anything
I'd ever experienced.

1795
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:45,687
I felt more me than I ever had.

1796
01:13:46,957 --> 01:13:47,388
And I'm glad I did it.

1797
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:49,757
I'm glad I could.

1798
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:53,995
Wow. Marcia, that's wonderful.

1799
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,164
Marty knows

1800
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:57,410
and he's known for a while.

1801
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:00,168
He was just giving me the
space to tell you myself,

1802
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,569
and I failed him.

1803
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:03,004
I got nervous.

1804
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,439
There was all that press.

1805
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,468
Everyone in town
pointing fingers.

1806
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:08,187
Then the police were

01:21:53,293 --> 01:21:54,558
and...

1988
01:21:54,594 --> 01:21:57,828
Listen, I was in a lot of pain.

1989
01:21:57,897 --> 01:22:00,131
I was lonely.

1990
01:22:00,266 --> 01:22:04,068
I just didn't realize
how much until I met you.

1991
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:08,673
And for the record, I would
never sleep with marty.

1992
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:09,840
Oh, I know...

1993
01:22:09,876 --> 01:22:11,836
And he couldn't
afford you anyways.

1994
01:22:15,515 --> 01:22:16,625
So, what are your plans?

1995
01:22:16,649 --> 01:22:18,949
Are you going to stay in luton?

1996
01:22:18,985 --> 01:22:21,018
I don't think it's a good idea.

1997
01:22:21,154 --> 01:22:22,420
Yeah, probably not.

1998
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:25,230
I'm really going to miss you.

1999
01:22:26,626 --> 01:22:28,292

Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

2003
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:40,237
Just have to make a quick stop.

2004
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:41,305
