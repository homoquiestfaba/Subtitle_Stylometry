1
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,112
What happened?

2
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,362
What happened?

3
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,190
We'll kick their ass.
You'll see.

4
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,031
You see?

5
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,874
We're gonna get much more.

6
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,588
This shitty thing...

7
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,107
Fuck off, asshole.
Don't fuck around. Get in.

8
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,202
Get in!

9
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,869
You're just fucking around.

10
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,630
You and your stupid shit.

11
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,091
This piece of shit...

12
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,429
There you go...

13
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,399
Lemme see...

14
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,954
Look how you left it, asshole.

15
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,162
Wait, asshole... Wait.

16
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,751
Let go, asshole.

17
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,925
It's fucking warm, man.

18
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:41,944
That it probably tastes like piss.

19
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,646
"Pendejo" my balls, asshole.

20
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,865
Oh really, asshole?
You gonna get tough?

21
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:06,134
Wait, you sonofabitch.
Fucking asshole.

22
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,836
You made me swallow dirt.
Fuck you, asshole.

23
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,757
Son of a bitch.

24
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,522
You're not gonna
help me carry them?

25
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,390
Son of a bitch.

26
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:33,491
Three days in Tucson.
Tucson, Tucson.

27
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,326
Three days in Tucson.

28
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,923
Three days with
a cousin in Tucson.

29
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:40,429
Three days in Tucson.
With a cousin in Tucson.

30
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,700
Morning. Mexican?

31
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,704
Go ahead.

32
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,325
Thanks.

33
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,505
What's up, Bacacho?

34
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,796
What's up, Arnulfo?

35
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,642
Hey, Arnulfo.

36
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,060
Hey.

37
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,555
I used this trip
to bring it all over.

38
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,611
Gimme the keys.

39
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,534
You put them
in the Suburban.

40
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,278
There was no one
at the checkpoint.

41
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,370
- Any trouble?
- Nah, they didn't give a shit.

42
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,242
Can I have a beer?

43
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:47,246
- They didn't give a shit.
- Now you're gonna talk to el Capi.

44
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,501
Sounds good.

45
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,212
But I'm gonna need
a bigger truck.

46
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,343
To move bigger
shipments, no?

47
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,304
You only bring
what's yours.

48
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,222
Right. Thanks.

49
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,774
Any trouble you let us know.

50
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,099
- Got it.
- Yes.

51
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,256
Ready.

52
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,178
- Great, thanks.
- Take care.

53
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,906
Put it there.

54
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,497
Pop those panels.

55
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,378
- Can you or can't you?
- Yes, sir.

56
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,047
And this guy?

57
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,956
I don't know, man.

58
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,470
It's got this hook
at the bottom. Push it.

59
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,309
There you go.
One, two, three...

60
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,360
Cool, huh?

61
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:48,155
Fuck you. You take a shower.
You smell like feet.

62
00:13:56,211 --> 00:14:00,301
Don't do that again, asshole.
I can fuck you up.

63
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,731
Watch out, asshole!

64
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,666
Don't be sloppy, man.
Put up those seats.

65
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,376
Yes, sir.

66
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,337
- Are the hinges working?
- Yes, sir.

67
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,965
Yes, sir...
Call me Capi, dude.

68
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,425
What's up, man?

69
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,466
What's up.

70
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,717
Get here earlier,
and don't load so much.

71
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,807
It still had room.

72
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,848
Doesn't matter.

73
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,236
- It's the last one?
- Yes.

74
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,910
Bring that over here.

75
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,457
Put it there.
There's still room.

76
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,915
What you looking at, man?

77
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,820
What you looking at?

78
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,787
What you looking at, you fag?

79
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:25,919
What, you wanna kiss me?
Huh?

80
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:30,179
You wanna kiss me?

81
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,455
He was playing cool
but he gave them his stereo...

82
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,326
...so they wouldn't
tell his father.

83
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,503
Whatever, asshole...

84
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,963
You know what
they called him in school?

85
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,934
The "micro" chip.

86
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,307
- Let's dance.
- I don't like this song.

87
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:19,308
Come on!

88
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:02,023
- Can I see it?
- Yes, of course.

89
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,858
- How much is it?
- Thirteen hundred.

90
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,781
Hi uncle...

91
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,662
I'm fine...

92
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,953
I brought a
gift for my cousin...

93
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,249
Nothing big, just a little gift...

94
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,259
You just give the order
and it's done.

95
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,889
Right?

96
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:31,062
Hey, Bacacho.
How's it going?

97
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,356
- Hello. Arnulfo.
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,740
Martin's nephew.
He's working with el Capi.

99
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,990
- What's up, Arnulfo?
- Nice to meet you, Gil.

100
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,576
Just dropping by.
I brought a gift for my cousin.

101
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,789
Thank you.
How's your mom?

102
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,668
Good, good. Feeling better.
She sends her best.

103
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,169
- Thanks.
- Yeah, all's good.

104
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,300
Right, Bacacho? I dropped
another batch to el Capi.

105
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:04,101
I'll do another run
by the end of the month.

106
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:07,474
Fine. Go get
some food, son.

107
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,635
Yes, yes.
Thanks... Thanks.

108
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,855
Excuse me.

109
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,187
What did you do, asshole?

110
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,989
But...

111
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:26,646
Hello... Is
Bacacho around?

112
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:30,905
Do you know if
he took his phone?

113
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:37,576
No, all good. I wanted
to ask him something.

114
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:45,424
No, it's fine.
Ok. Take care.

115
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,719
Motherfuck!

116
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,129

117
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,275

00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,322
Hey.

123
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,657
Hey!

124
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,852
- You have aspirins?
- Only acetlisal.

125
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:21,845
- You want?
- Yes.

126
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,443
Thanks.

127
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,696
Give me your fucking number.

128
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,489
Gimme your number!

129
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,584
You're gonna call
and say you're ok.

130
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,092
What do you mean "no" fucker?

131
00:36:56,796 --> 00:37:00,546
Don't lie. I saw the photo of
your fucking wife.

132
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,140
Gimme the fucking number!

133
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,587

134
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,005
Shut up, asshole.

135
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,986
Hello? What's up, Capi?

136
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,744
All good, all good.

137
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,539
Oh, yes.

138
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,958
Just wanted to tell you
we're on for the fifth.

139
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,576
Cool.

140
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,835
Bye.

141
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,975
Move, asshole.

142
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,980
There.

143
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,567
Move it!

144
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,797
What you looking at?

145
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,719
You fag.

146
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,192
Come on, move!

147
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,650
How do you know about the milk?

148
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,119
I'm talking to you.

149
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,602
You with the DEA?

150
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,789
You probably know, huh?

151
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,049
Fuck!

152
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,718
Shut up!

153
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,810
Shut up!

154
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:43,519
Shut up, asshole!

155
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Espera...

00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:24,308

157
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:28,358
- Where you going?

159
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,235
Get down, asshole.

160
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:38,986
Topo!

161
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,445
Check out what I found.

162
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,591
Tell me, motherfucker,
what the hell is this?

163
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:55,009
He's my partner. He had an
accident and I'm taking him...

164
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,338
...to a hospital.

165
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:59,011
You think I'm an asshole?

166
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,012
Bro, this truck's tooled.

167
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:02,806
Come here, motherfucker.

168
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,517
Easy, easy, easy...

169
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:30,793
Asshole?

170
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:59,324
Checkpoint...

171
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,451
A truck with a gringo
wants to pass...

172
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,544
...check them out...

173
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,579
...and let them pass...

174
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,748
Move it.

175
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,662
Don't play stupid.

176
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,256
Fuck off.

177
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,481
Who knows, man...

178
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,140
What do you call them?

179
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,101
The State finals.

180
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,896
Fuck.

181
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,222
Hello?

182
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,563
What's up Bacacho?

183
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:10,442
Yes, I just wanted
to talk to my uncle.

184
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,440
To ask him a favor.

185
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,450
Yeah.

186
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:20,032
So I'll wait for your call.

187
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,831
Got it, great. Bye.

188
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:36,463
What's up, Cota?

189
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:40,635
I know... But I need
to talk before you leave...

190
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,892
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

191
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:45,679
You still have the workshop?

192
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,644
You think I can
crash there?

193
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:54,435
Just to wait there until
I go see my uncle...

194
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:56,941
In thirty minutes...

195
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,444
Cool... thanks.

196
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,355
Thanks, bro. Bye.

197
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,180
Shut the fuck up.

198
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,465
Keep him quiet. Manque
is upstairs with the baby.

199
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,468
Ok.

200
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,665
Here you go, dude.

201
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,926
Don't lose the keys.

202
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:48,758
Don't worry.

203
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,773
Help me
put them on...

204
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,977
Don't be a fag.
If you dragged him here...

205
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:55,186
Do it yourself.

206
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,104
Come on, help me.

207
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,647
Give them to me...

208
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,032
Aim at him.

209
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:16,712
Let's see your hands.

210
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,471
Easy there.

211
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,308
There you go, Arni.

212
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,479
Thanks, man.

213
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,454
Manque made hotcakes.
If you're hungry.

214
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,950
Yeah, thanks man.

215
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:02,837
Let me see...

216
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:09,891
Hi uncle...
All good... All good...

217
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,720
Just wanted to say hi...

218
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,814
To tell you about
an opportunity...

219
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:05,065
Ok... We'll talk later.

220
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,280
What's up, Arnulfo?

221
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,279
Just passing by to say hello.

222
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,657
You still owe Capi some stuff, no?

223
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:15,528
Almost nothing.
It's all stored up.

224
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,661
So why'd you come here?

225
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,997
Just wanted to see my uncle.

226
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,170
To ask a favor.

227
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,212
And why don't you ask me?

228
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:30,014
Because it's...

229
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:31,932
It's a family thing.

230
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,144
I won't take long.

231
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,854
Someone's looking for you, Martin.

232
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:43,562
Hello, uncle.

233
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:47,397
What's up, Arnulfo?

234
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,744
I just wanted to talk for a moment.

235
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,573
You should be doing your thing, no?

236
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,276
Yeah, right?

237
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,924
What?

238
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,458
Something wrong?

239
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,420
So...?

240
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:18,095
I've got something
that'll interest you.

241
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,135
What?

242
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,152
Come over here.

243
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,789
Where were you
before coming here?

244
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:47,541
I came straight here.

245
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,711
Does your mother
know about this?

246
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,208
No.

247
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,970
- You see anyone else?
- No.

248
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,770
What the fuck
are you thinking?

249
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,068
Why the fuck did
you bring him here?

250
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:17,912
He's got information.
I thought it could help you.

251
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:23,041
You think we're all
fucking stupid?

252
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:26,158
We're stupid, right?
And what about you?

253
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:29,785
What about you and
your faggot shit?

254
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:33,092
He's with the ATF.

255
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,640
He knows all the names,
the routes, the shipments...

256
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:42,555
Let's see what
your gringo knows.

257
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,480
Bring him.

258
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,440
Here he is.

259
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:37,457
You know who I am?

260
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,966
No?

261
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:44,804
You sure?

262
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:49,641
Didn't you know a lot?

263
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:53,984
My nephew says
you know a lot.

264
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:57,734
But you don't know anything.

265
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:01,145
Are you a cop?

266
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:56,633
Arnulfo...

267
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,836
You're coming with
me to La Primavera.

268
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,007
No, uncle.

269
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:04,589
Come on, move.

270
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,749
Give me the
handcuff keys.

271
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:48,203
Let's do this fast.

272
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,529
He's got information
that can help you.

273
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,530
Fuck, come on!

274
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,241
Come on...

275
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:59,293
...you have to take him after.

276
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,210
Grab it, goddamit.

277
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,852
Go.

278
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:21,023
What the fuck you mean, no?

279
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,266
He can help. Gimme a
chance to take him.

280
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,823
There's no
chance of shit.

281
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,946
Go.

282
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:34,405
What?

283
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,865
You gonna cry?

284
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,079
You gonna cry, asshole?

285
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,875
Ok...

286
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,258
...ok then.

287
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,966
You're a faggot.

288
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,818
I can't find the goddamn phone.

289
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,941
Hi, mom.

290
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:28,311
What are you doing
here, Arnulfo?

291
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:30,647
We just had some trouble.

292
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:33,992
- I just need to make a phone call.
- They called me, Arnulfo.

293
01:08:33,993 --> 01:08:35,985
They already called me.

294
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,907
Everything's fine.

295
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:44,036
My friend will help us.

296
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,787
What friend?

297
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,041
What the hell are
you thinking, Arnulfo?

298
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:51,554
I don't want to hear him.

299
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:58,887
Let me make a call,
they'll come for us.

300
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,389
You can't be here.

301
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,973
I can't have you
here when they come.

302
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:04,974
Mom...

303
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,104
I'm talking to you...

304
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:11,395
Mom!

305
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:16,065
So where should I go?

306
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:21,081
I didn't want to leave
Colima but I came, right?

307
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:24,285
I don't know,
but you fucked us.

308
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,038
Here. Take this.

309
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,919
Do what you have to do,
but you can't stay here.

310
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,764
Fuck you, bitch!

311
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,665
Hello, godfather...

312
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,963
Yeah, all's good.

313
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,553
Listen, can I come over?

314
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,800
My mom's in Pericos...

315
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:20,876
Yes, in about an hour.

316
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,666
Your godmother went
to Marisela's house.

317
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,961
She took dinner to the girls.

318
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,641
Sit.

319
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:13,444
- Yes, thanks.
- You ok?

320
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,441
Yes, all's fine.

321
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,605
You sure?

322
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:20,985
They wanted to screw
us near Gómez Farías.

323
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:23,696
Some assholes,
so we came down here.

324
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,831
We're waiting for some
guys to go to Nogales.

325
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,584
Why were you
by Gómez Farías?

326
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:35,424
We were detoured there,
but I came from Peńitas.

327
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,669
But everything's all right.

328
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,918
Until it's not.

329
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:42,589
And then?

330
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,426
Let me get you
something to eat.

331
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:47,967
- No need, it's fine.
- Hold on.

332
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,988
Eat this.

333
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,203
Thanks.

334
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,412
So?

335
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,577
You're going where?

336
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,246
Nogales?

337
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:23,545
Yes, we've got a
job over there.

338
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,798
And then?

339
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:29,763
I'm taking
off for a while.

340
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,453
And this guy?

341
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:46,818
He's my partner.

342
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:48,871
He's working
with my uncle.

343
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,666
Hello?

344
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,957
Hello?

345
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,006
Let me call
your godmother.

346
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:09,342
See what time
she's back.

347
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:15,603
What's up, honey?

348
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,768
How are the girls?

349
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,147
They eat dinner?

350
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:25,691
You're kidding?

351
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,695
Listen... Arnulfo is here.

352
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,740
No, no, he's
almost leaving...

353
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,119
Hold on.

354
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:47,296
No, wait... wait.

355
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,223
Go get the other one.

356
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:34,215
You motherfucker.
What did you think?

357
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,930
You would just
leave like that?

358
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:39,562
Not here, Capi.

359
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,937
Go get Roca.
