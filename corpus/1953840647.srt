129
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,680
      HE MAKES ME SCREAM.       

130
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,950
  THE WAY YOU HEARD ME SCREAM,  
          THE WAY I--           

131
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,820
       I WANT TO SCREAM.        

132
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,888
     - THIS IS A SEX THING?     
             - YES.             

133
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,791
      - NO, WAIT A MINUTE.      

134
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,026
       YOU'RE TRYING TO--       
    YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME    

135
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,027
    THAT I CAN'T GIVE YOU--     

136
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,662
             - NO.              

137
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,764
- THAT I'VE NEVER GIVEN YOU AN--
          - NOT ONCE.           

138
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,432
     - YOU'VE HAD ORGASMS.      

139
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,634
   - NAH, I--I WAS FAKING IT.   
       - I'VE HEARD YOU.        

140
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,436
        NOT EVERY TIME.         
         - EVERY TIME.          

141
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,405
     YOU'VE ACTUALLY NEVER      
        HEARD ME CLIMAX,        

142
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,040
       NOT--NOT FOR REAL.       

143
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,142
      OKAY, WHAT YOU HEARD      
 BEFORE YOU CAME IN THAT ROOM,  

144
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,511
   THAT'S WHAT I SOUND LIKE.    

145
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,413
    GOD, I'M SO SORRY, WILL.    

146
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,382
  I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T WANT YOU   
     TO FIND OUT LIKE THIS.     

147
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,950
             WAIT.              
      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?      

148
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,052
   OKAY, COME ON, I LOVE YOU.   
          - BUT WHAT?           

149
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,054
BECAUSE I DON'T PLUG YOUR OUTLET
         THE RIGHT WAY,         

150
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,056
    YOU'RE GONNA THROW AWAY     
  A YEAR AND A HALF TOGETHER?   

151
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,024
  YOU--YOU--YOU COULDN'T TALK   
       TO ME ABOUT THIS,        

152
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,559
GIVEN ME THE CHANCE TO IMPROVE? 

153
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,128
  - WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS   
        NUMEROUS TIMES,         

154
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,763
   AND YOU JUST DON'T LISTEN.   

155
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,065
  YOU IMPROVE FOR A DAY OR SO,  

156
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,100
    BUT YOU DON'T GET CLOSE     
       TO GETTING ME OFF.       

157
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,102
      AND THEN YOU GO BACK      
      TO HUMPING SO FAST,       

158
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,671
 IT'S LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO WIN 
SOME SORT OF WORLD SPEED RECORD.

159
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,173
          - OH, JESUS,          
      SO I'M TOO FAST TOO.      

160
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,741
            - YEAH.             

161
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,410
         - DID YOU HAVE         
ANY OTHER CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM

162
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,978
     YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE ME      
      BEFORE WE PART WAYS?      

163
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,780
        - WELL, YOU KNOW        
 THAT HIGH-PITCHED NOSE WHISTLE 

164
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,081
     WHEN YOU'RE FINISHING?     

165
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,616
 IT DOESN'T DO YOU ANY FAVORS.  

166
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,919
            [sighs]             

167
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,087
           I'M SORRY.           
           YOU ASKED.           

168
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,555
              I...              

169
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,460
       - RICKY SHREDDER,        
          GO TO MOMMY.          

170
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,829
          - COME HERE.          

171
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,564
             - SIT.             

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
        RICKY SHREDDER,         

173
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,802
      TAKE CARE OF MOMMY.       

174
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,471
     - OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.     
           WHY DID--            

175
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,573
   WHY DID YOU STOP BY TODAY?   

176
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,546
   - I CAME BY TO ASK YOU...    

177
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,685
           [chuckles]           

178
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,456
     TO ASK YOU IF YOU KNOW     
      WHO JOHNNY STORM IS.      

179
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:43,195
  - UH, THE SLEAZY WEATHER GUY  
       ON CHANNEL SEVEN?        

180
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,066

181
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,135
       HAVE A NICE LIFE.        

182
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,539
       - WILL, I'M SORRY.

              ¶                 

185
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,885
             - HEY.             

186
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,122
            - WHOA,             
 THERE'S MY NEWLY ENGAGED SON.

188
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:14,960
        HOW'D SHE REACT?        

189
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:18,864
  COME ON, I WANT THE DETAILS.  

190
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,866
         - SHE SCREAMED         

191
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,234
             A LOT.             

192
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,735
          - YOU KNOW,           
WHEN I PROPOSED TO YOUR MOTHER, 

193
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,237
      SHE WAS SO ECSTATIC,      

194
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,006
      SHE GAVE ME HUMMERS       
 EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR A MONTH.  

195
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,141
          - GOD, DAD.           
         - NO, LISTEN.          

196
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,844
      BLOW JOBS GO THE WAY      
OF BETA TAPE AND DRIVE-IN MOVIES

197
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,213

SO STRIKE WHILE THE IRON'S HOT. 

198
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,719
   - YOU WEARING MY CLOTHES?    

199
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:44,089
   - I NEED SOME SWEET NECTAR   

200
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:48,059
   TO ATTRACT A CERTAIN BEE.    

201
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,995
             - WHO?             

202
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,296
         - YOUR MOTHER.         

203
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,699
  - YOU HAVE A DATE WITH MOM?   

204
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,002
       - SHE HAS A DATE,        

205
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,170
     AND I'M FOLLOWING HER      
     TO MAKE SURE THE LOSER     

206
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,173
        KEEPS HIS INMATE

     DID YOU PUT ON COLOGNE     
         TO STALK MOM?          

209
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,018
        - DRAKKAR NOIR.         

210
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,221
          - OH, JESUS.          
        - HER FAVORITE.         

211
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,589
            LISTEN,             
   I GOT TO GET MY PORN BACK,   

212
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,125
  BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO  

213
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,794
    BEFORE THE STORE CLOSES.    

214
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,629
THERE'S 10 BUCKS IN IT FOR YOU. 

215
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,165
          - 10 BUCKS?           
 WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, EIGHT? 

216
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,267
         - MAKE IT 20.          

217
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,819
        - WISH ME LUCK.         

218
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,626
        - OH, DEAR LORD.        

219
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,131
       - SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

          [bed creaks]          

221
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,610
           - SHE WAS.           

222
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,812
   SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE NOW.    

223
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,718
 - SOLD HER TO BUY JEN'S RING?  

224
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,620
            - YEAH.             

225
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,391
    A RING SHE DIDN'T WANT.     

226
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:29,260
      - WHAT DO YOU MEAN?       
          SHE SAID NO?          

227
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,795
 I THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE HAPPY.  

228
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,697
            - I WAS,            

229
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,166
    BUT I GUESS THAT IN ALL     
 THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, 

230
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,637
     I NEVER MANAGED TO...      

231
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,804
          GET HER OFF.          

232
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,140
    - SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU     
           FOR THAT,            

233
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,876
I MEAN, WITHOUT EVEN TELLING YOU
         HOW TO FIX IT?         

234
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,945
      - SHE SAID SHE DID--      
     THAT I DIDN'T LISTEN.      

235
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,047
 - WELL, ANY GIRL WHO SAYS THAT 
        IS EITHER LYING         

236
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,715
       OR TRYING TO FIND        
        A EASY WAY OUT.         

237
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,284
       - NO, SHE'S RIGHT.       

238
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,020
      I SUCK IN BED, DUDE.      

239
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,056
     - YEAH, HOW COULD YOU      
  POSSIBLY KNOW THAT FOR SURE?  

240
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,392
           - I ASKED.           
           - [laughs]           

241
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,662
 WILL, WE WENT OUT FOR A COUPLE 
   OF MONTHS SOPHOMORE YEAR.    

242
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,197
 I MEAN, I CAN BARELY REMEMBER  
   WHAT I HAD FOR BREAKFAST,    

243
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,267
    LET ALONE WHETHER OR NOT    
   I GOT OFF WHEN WE HAD SEX.   

244
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,302
          - [laughing]          

245
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,771
   - YEAH, IT NEVER HAPPENED.   

246
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,039
             - OH.              

247
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,808
    - HOW ABOUT A CAPPUCCINO    
         ON THE HOUSE?          

248
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,977
        - IT'S SO FUNNY         
YOU SHOULD ASK ABOUT THIS, WILL,

249
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,212
   'CAUSE JUST THE OTHER DAY,   
  SOME OF MY GIRLFRIENDS AND I  

250

  OUR WORST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE,  

251
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,718
     AND YOU JUST HAPPENED      
        TO COME TO MIND.

    SHE WAS LOOKING AT YOU?     

1004
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:14,283
       SHE UNDRESSED YOU        
        WITH HER STARE.

1026
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,702
      AND WHEN SHE GOT UP       
     TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

  I WALKED OVER TO HER TABLE,   

1028
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:09,072
    DROPPED IT IN HER PURSE.

  COULD USE A GOOD GUARD DOG.   

1042
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,469
          - OKAY, DAD,          
  THIS IS NOT YOUR APARTMENT.   

1043
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:41,404

        - SUPER BABIES.         

2117

    ¶ BEFORE THE FIRST DAY      

2123
01:31:44,233 --> 01:31:48,001
  ¶ OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE    

2124
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:51,238
    ¶ PICK YOURSELF UP NOW      

2125
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,239
           - HI, UH.            

2126
01:31:52,241 --> 01:31:54,641
           [gasping]            

2127
01:31:54,643 --> 01:31:56,076
        HOW DID YOU GUYS        
     COME UP WITH THE IDEA      

2128
01:31:56,078 --> 01:31:57,777
        ABOUT <i>SUPER DAD?</i>        

2129
01:31:57,779 --> 01:31:59,779
        - OH, UH, WELL,         

2130
01:31:59,781 --> 01:32:01,114
 WILL HAD A GENERAL STORY IDEA  

2131
01:32:01,116 --> 01:32:02,816
        ABOUT A MAN-SLUT        
        WITH SUPERPOWERS        

2132
01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:05,051
         WHO KNOCKED UP         
A BUNCH OF HIS ONE-NIGHT STANDS.

2133
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:06,152
    SO THAT GOT US THINKING,    

2134
01:32:06,154 --> 01:32:08,054
WHAT IF ALL THAT HUMPING AROUND 

2135
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:10,857
     CAME BACK TO HAUNT HIM     
          IN SOME WAY?          

2136
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:13,159
      SO THEN WE THOUGHT,       
     OKAY, HERE'S THE PLOT:     

2137
01:32:13,161 --> 01:32:15,896
      SUPER DAD'S ENEMIES       
 KILL ALL OF HIS FORMER LOVERS  

2138
01:32:15,898 --> 01:32:17,564
   TO GET BACK AT SUPER DAD,    

2139
01:32:17,566 --> 01:32:19,266
    BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW    
       IS THAT SUPER DAD        

2140
01:32:19,268 --> 01:32:21,935
   HAS ALL THESE ILLEGITIMATE   
    CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND     

2141
01:32:21,937 --> 01:32:24,538
       WHO HAVE INHERITED       
        HIS SUPERPOWERS.        

2142
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:27,974
SO NOW NOT ONLY IS HE IN CHARGE 
 OF DEFENDING THE ENTIRE WORLD, 

2143
01:32:27,976 --> 01:32:31,244
 HE'S GOT TO RAISE THIS GAGGLE  
    OF SUPERPOWERED BABIES.     

2144
01:32:31,246 --> 01:32:32,913
     AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH     
        THE SPRINGBOARD         

2145
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:35,015
       TO THE WHOLE, UH--       
       THE WHOLE SERIES.

          RIGHT, WILL?

     - YEAH, WHAT HE SAID.      
           HE GOT IT.
