1
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,500
(engine starts up)

2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,267
Dad, are we there yet?

3
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,100
Not quite, sweetheart.
We'll be home before long.

4
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,667
You guys want to sing
to pass the time?

5
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,733
-Yeah?
-Hooray!

6
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,233
Hey, you wanna sing, Max?

7
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,467
Yeah? Steven, you wanna sing?

8
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,800
-I can sing.
-Yeah. Do you wanna sing?

9
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,467
-Yeah.
-Okay.

10
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,633
* (all singing London Bridge 
 is Falling Down ) *

11
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,567
* (singing continues) *

12
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,333
(smashing)

13
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:33,467
(brakes screeching)

14
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,067
(crashing)

15
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,667
I'm Dr. Klein. Uh, you are...

16
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,367
I'm Len Jordan,
uh, Luke's brother.

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,100
My wife, Ruth.

18
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,300
Mr. and Mrs. Jordan,

19
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,967
I'm not quite sure
how to say this, but...

20
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:08,533
...both Luke and Helen, as well
as their daughter Jennifer

21
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,333
-didn't survive the crash.
-(gasps)

22
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:15,333
What about the boys?
What about Max and Steven?

23
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,267
Well, Max is undergoing
some routine tests

24
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,067
but it looks as though
he's going to be fine.

25
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,467
Steven, on the other hand,
is in critical shape.

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,467
He suffered massive
cranial damage

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,633
-and he's currently comatose.
-(gasps)

28
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,500
(sobs)

29
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,500
Is he going to live?

30
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,600
Well, the next 48 hours are
going to be very critical but...

31
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:45,700
if he does survive,

32
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,700
he's going to need
multiple operations.

33
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,633
There's also the chance

34
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,533
that Steven might be
mentally impaired

35
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,100
as a result of his injuries.

36
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm afraid he's going
to need long-term

37
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,067
possibly even permanent, care.

38
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:00,733
Dr. Klein: I'm very sorry...

39
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,400
Well, I, uh,
better get back and see them.

40
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,667
I'll let you know as soon as
there's any change.

41
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,167
(receding footsteps)

42
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:15,933
(distraught sobbing)

43
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,467
(thunder rumbles)

44
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,833
(typing)

45
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,500
Ruthie!

46
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:34,667
Ruthie!

47
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:37,967
I'm coming.

48
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,867
(typing)

49
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,967
Congratulations, sweetheart.

50
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:51,667
Oh, I couldn't have done it
without you.

51
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,733
(gushes)

52
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:56,233
So, now what do you think?

53
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,633
Well, I think it's brilliant.

54
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,100
-Really?
-Yep.

55
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,367
In fact,
I think it's so brilliant

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,067
Harry's only gonna make me
rewrite it five times.

57
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,067
(laughs)
Well, we hate him.

58
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,133
-Yes...
-(doorbell rings)

59
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,233
Now, who could that be?

60
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:11,567
(chair creaks loudly)

61
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,367
(thunder rumbles)

62
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,867
Ruth: Oh, for goodness sake.

63
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,100
It's Max.

64
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,900
(door opens)

65
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,933
Ruth: Honey, look at you...

66
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,200
Come in. Take your coat off.

67
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,833
Maxwell, my boy.

68
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,633
You're just in time
to help us celebrate.

69
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,667
Take your coat off and sit down.

70
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,400
So, we're celebrating.

71
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,067
You must've finished
your new novel.

72
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,467
Len: You bet your boots, I did.

73
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,933
Great. What's it called?

74
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:51,200
(both chuckle)

75
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,133
Very funny, Max.

76
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,267
"Very funny."

77
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,567
So it's a comedy?

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,867
Oh, "a comedy."
Would you listen to him?

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,067
(both chuckle)

80
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,067
Max, is everything all right?

81
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,600
Max: "Is everything all right?"

82
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,133
(thunder rumbles)

83
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,067
(giggles dryly)

84
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:17,633
Well...

85
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,333
...why wouldn't it be?

86
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,500
You know...

87
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,500
There's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

88
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,933
(thunder rumbles)

89
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,067
(multiple gunshots)

90
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,500
Man: I'm always amazed at people
that seem to know

91
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,400
the right thing to say
at a time like this.

92
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,933
I don't know if there are
any words that can

93
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,967
really make sense out of
what's happened.

94
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:21,533
So... I'd like to borrow
from Uncle Len's writing...

95
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:23,867
...to eulogize them.

96
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,267
"Death is never cruel
to its recipient.

97
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:32,833
But to those who are left
with a piercing memory,

98
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,433
a sting that soon softens
into the numbness..."

99
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,167
Uncle Len, I'll never understand
why this happened...

100
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,067
...but I want you to know that
in my heart...

101
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,900
...I forgive you.

102
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,100
Stu: Thanks for having us,
sweetheart.

103
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,133
Oh, of course, Stu.

104
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,633
-Whatever we can do for you.
-Oh, thank you.

105
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,867
That's very nice.

106
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,533
Remember, we're family
and we're here for you.

107
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,933
-You take care, Liv.
-Oh, Stu, thanks for coming.

108
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,367
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,433
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye, now.

110
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,467
Stu: Bye.

111
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,167
"Liv".
I hate that name.

112
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,067
Why did he call me that?

113
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,167
You know,
she didn't bother me so much,

114
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,167
it was just the...
the friends she brought along.

115
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,633
-Oh, Tess--
-The two friends seemed kinda

116
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,067
-nice to me.
-Oh, nice, fabulous people.

117
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,067
I just hope Macy's isn't
missing that mannequin.

118
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,700
-Oh, gosh.
-(laughs)

119
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,967
Yeah, we do a lot
of weird things

120
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,067
in our lives but
a post funeral party

121
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,367
has got to be the strangest.

122
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,433
Well, you know,
it's a good excuse to have

123
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,500
a few drinks.

124
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,667
You don't need an excuse.

125
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,133
-Hey--
-I mean,

126
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,200
all those people needing to
tell us everything that they

127
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:01,833
really wanted to say to Uncle
Len but never got a chance to.

128
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,667
Well, you know,
people need closure.

129
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,367
It's their way
of tying things up

130
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,933
so they can get on
with their lives.

131
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,200
No extra baggage,
no unresolved issues.

132
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,900
Mm, I love it when you

133
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,133
-talk dirty like that.
-Uncle Len...

134
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,633
Why would he do something
like this?

135
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,300
I mean, him, of all people?

136
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,100
Well he did suffer
from depression.

137
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,167
Yeah..

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Tess,
it couldn't have been that bad.

139
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,567
Tess: Well, sometimes the downs
can be so intense

140
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,867
that they can push even
nonviolent people to extremes.

141
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,067
Tess, you knew him...
and do you really think

142
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,633
he could've done something
like this?

143
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,333
Well, no one really
could've known.

144
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,667
-You know, it's--
-What did the note say?

145
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,500
If you don't mind me asking.

146
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,633
It said:

147
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,767
"In a perfect world there is

148
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,067
no illness,

149
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,200
no suffering,

150
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,233
no pain.

151
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,533
No disappointment.

152
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,800
No fear.
No emptiness.

153
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,467
But this world is not
a perfect one.

154
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,667
And I am not
who I appear to be."

155
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,733
(pants lightly)

156
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:20,833
Woman: Are you coming to bed?

157
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,067
Yeah...

158
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,767
Good night.

159
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,533
Do you feel like talking?

160
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,233
No.

161
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,067
I love you.

162
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,600
(siren sounds in distance)

163
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,567
God bless you.

164
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:13,867
-Hi.
-Hi, boss.

165
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,933
How ya holding' up?

166
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,533
Good, good.
Thanks for being there.

167
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,067
Oh, please... I mean, you should
have taken the day off.

168
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,167
No choice. We got too much
going on around here.

169
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,767
Oh, yeah. The lovely
and talented Stu Fishman

170
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,733
-wants to see us when we get in.
-No.

171
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,633
-Are you in?
-Yeah...

172
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,533
I'm sure he just wants
to give you the old:

173
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,967
"We're really sorry about
the tragedy.

174
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,333
We hope this won't affect
your work performance?" bit.

175
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:34,400
I mean, let's face it.

176
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,200
The guy's got
a gold-plated heart.

177
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:39,300
-Are you ready for these?
-I just saw the weirdest thing.

178
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,500
On my way in,
there was this old guy...

179
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:42,533
A homeless guy.

180
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,800
And he had this sign
around his neck that said,

181
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,667
"Why lie? I need a drink."

182
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,800
I gave him 20 bucks.

183
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,067
You gave a complete stranger
20 dollars?

184
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,067
Yeah, but it...
it's not about the money.

185
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,667
This guy was just out there

186
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,333
in front of everyone.

187
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,767
Just kind of... naked.

188
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,133
-Naked?
-Well, not...

189
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,500
Not physically naked,
just... vulnerable.

190
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,333
Like he was exactly
the same on the inside

191
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,867
as he is on the outside.

192
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,067
He had no secrets.
He had nothing to hide.

193
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,067
Did you hit your head
on the way to work today?

194
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,500
What were you saying about
a gold-plated heart?

195
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,467
Oh, no. I'm kidding.
I love that story.

196
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,633
-Mm-hmm.
-I do.

197
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:26,667
Let's go.

198
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,067
(phone rings)

199
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,767
Uh, let me get that
and I'll be there in a sec.

200
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,767
Max Jordan's office.

201
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,367
Man:
 What do you suggest we do, Stu?

202
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,133
Don't pay out on the Shane
account and stall on the loan.

203
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,800
I've crunched the numbers.
This is the best that I can do.

204
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,533
Well, crunch 'em again.

205
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,633
As for you,

206
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,400
you'd better
come through on Russo.

207
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,500
Now, we all know you've been
through a hell of an ordeal

208
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:51,833
the last few days,

209
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:55,667
but to close this deal
I need you at 200 percent.

210
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,833
Well,
I'm having dinner with him

211
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,833
in a couple nights.
I'm sure I'll sign him.

212
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,067
(knocking on door)

213
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,267
Oh, good.
Come on in, sweetheart.

214
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,267
Have a seat.

215
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:07,633
Max, I want you
to take Scarlett along.

216
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,567
Excuse me?

217
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,633
Take her along
to this Russo dinner.

218
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,500
She's a good looking girl.
Russo's a pig.

219
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,500
I think he'd appreciate
a little eye candy.

220
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,233
He'll go gaga over her.

221
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:24,100
Don't worry.
It'll be fun.

222
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,167
And with the money
we make off Russo,

223
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,867
I'll be able to bring Stu up
on sexual harassment charges.

224
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,733
(laughs)

225
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,767
Max: You know
I stand to bring in

226
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,233
a couple million bucks
for this company.

227
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,467
What is he talking about
200 percent?

228
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:39,433
Didn't you get the memo?

229
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,667
Look, nobody knows about this

230
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,767
but we got about three months
of operating costs left

231
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,900
-in our account.
-What are you talking about?

232
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:51,800
Every deal Stu has gotten us
into has tanked.

233
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,967
I can't tell you how much we
lost on the Marina deal alone.

234
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:58,067
Look, I don't want to be
the bearer of bad news.

235
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,633
But if you don't pull out Russo,

236
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,800
we're gonna be
on the streets by June.

237
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,133
-But--
-Hey, listen. Listen.

238
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:04,767
Come here.

239
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:08,600
Don't feel the pressure.
I got faith in you. All right?

240
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,433
Woman (over phone):
 ICU.

241
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:22,933
Olivia Jordan for Ruth Jordan.

242
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:26,700
(door buzzes)

243
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:37,233
(monitor bleeps steadily)

244
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:38,867
(air pumping)

245
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:54,900
Hello...

246
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,633
How are you?

247
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,833
Don't think for a second
that I'd let a day go by

248
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,933
without us doing
the crossword puzzle together.

249
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,100
Let's see...

250
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,900
One across.

251
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:14,800
Three letter word for
"the ancient god of fertility."

252
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,067
What do you think?

253
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,433
(silence)

254
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,133
That's what I thought.

255
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,067
Okay.
Fourteen across.

256
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,067
"Rayed flower."

257
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,133
(holds back tears)
Um, five letters.

258
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,167
(sighs)

259
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,367
Max: I went by Aunt Ruth's 
 and Uncle Len's.

260
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,133
Olivia: Why didn't you call me?
I would have met you there.

261
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,633
What would you say if I told you

262
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,733
I wanted to start looking for
another job?

263
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,233
Maybe start my own business
with Jackson?

264
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:21,600
Wow.
Are you serious?

265
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,533
Yes. Yes, I'm very serious.

266
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,733
I've... I don't think I can work
for Stu Fishman anymore.

267
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:30,633
I mean, he screws up, we fix it.
We'd be better off on our own.

268
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,567
Honey...

269
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,767
Are you sure you're not
overreacting to things?

270
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,667
No. I'm not gonna do
anything drastic.

271
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,200
It's just that
I wanna get on with it.

272
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,200
I wanna make
every minute count.

273
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,067
You know,
you're all I have left...

274
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:45,700
...and I love you.

275
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,067
I love you, too.

276
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,867
And I think
we should have children.

277
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,867
What?

278
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,567
I just...

279
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,300
..think we should, uh,

280
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,600
start thinking about
having a family.

281
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:02,867
Do you mean that?

282
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,333
I'm not sure actually.
I don't--

283
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:07,600
No, Max! Max!

284
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:08,967
(laughs)

285
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,067
You mean that, don't you?

286
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,567
Let's start now.

287
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,500
-Now?
-Yes. Now.

288
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,900
-I... I just got home.
-Good.

289
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,567
You'd do it if you're not home?

290
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,400
(both laugh)

291
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,400
(groans)

292
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,800
-Max: Good morning, Scarlett. 
-Scarlett: Good morning.

293
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,200
I need you to make that 
 reservation

294
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,067
for the Russo dinner
at eight o'clock

295
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,367
-at Le Dejeuner.
-Mm, pretty swank.

296
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,633
Well, only the best
for Mr. Russo.

297
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,100
Listen, Scarlett,

298
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,533
I know that
you don't want to do this--

299
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,533
Well, we both know
you're nothing without me.

300
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:48,867
Right.

301
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,300
I didn't want to have to be
the one to say that.

302
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,433
-Gotcha.
-Hey,

303
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:52,567
before you get carried away,

304
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,233
Mr. Fishstick sent you
some email.

305
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,667
He's in Dallas
for a couple of days

306
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,933
and he wants you to check out
a property for him.

307
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,933
320 East 54th Street,
apartment 4B.

308
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:02,200
East 54th?

309
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,933
That's across the street
from my apartment.

310
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,533
Said you gotta be there
at three o'clock.

311
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,633
The keys are at the apartment.

312
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,367
Max: That's not even
a commercial space.

313
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,433
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

314
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,333
(sighs)

315
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:16,733
I'm gonna kill him.

316
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,733
When I'm done killing him,
I want you to kill him.

317
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:19,900
Love to...

318
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,567
as long as I still
get the free meal.

319
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:24,400
(door closes)

320
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,400
(siren wails in distance)

321
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,300
(loud creaking)

322
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,167
Hello?

323
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,467
Hello?

324
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,433
(siren wails in distance)

325
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,933
Welcome home, Max.

326
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,867
(groans)

327
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:01,067
(clattering)

328
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,500
(shutter clicks)

329
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,433
(shutter clicking)

330
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,200
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

331
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,300
Mm...

332
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,400
Nasty little bump, huh?

333
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,267
Hungry?

334
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,933
We gotta keep you well-fed,
you know.

335
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:23,200
Okay, simple ground rules.

336
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:25,067
It's kind of like
 This Is Your Life.

337
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,467
Now when I take off the tape,

338
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,433
you're to remain
completely silent.

339
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,167
If I ever hear you yell, scream,
cry or lie,

340
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,933
I'll kill someone near
and dear to you.

341
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:39,833
It's really very simple.

342
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,667
Shall we begin?

343
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:54,333
Who are you?

344
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,967
I'm your brother.

345
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,267
I don't have a brother.

346
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,933
Well, that's what Ruth and Len
told you but they're liars.

347
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,067
And that's why they're dead.

348
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:04,767
Ruth's still alive.

349
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,167
Well, that's true.
I did leave her alive.

350
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,267
But she's a veg.
And I'd choose death

351
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,733
over a veg any day,
wouldn't you?

352
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,433
She's living on borrowed time
in a lonely hospital room

353
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:16,700
just like I did.

354
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,667
Did that sound poetic to you?

355
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,800
Oh.

356
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,833
This must be all
very confusing to you.

357
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,467
The truth is,
I know everything about you.

358
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,100
You're married to the beautiful
and gorgeous creative designer,

359
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:45,900
Olivia.

360
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,933
And what is with this
realty company, Max?

361
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,533
I mean, you hate your boss,
you like your job.

362
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:52,933
I mean, the things
that I've watched...

363
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:57,233
Still, you live in a beautiful
apartment across the street.

364
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,767
I know who your friends are.

365
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,067
(photo hits floor)

366
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,200
What you like to drink.

367
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,333
(photo hits floor)

368
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,067
What you like to eat.

369
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,300
(photo hits floor)

370
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,300
And how much money
is in that checking account.

371
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,433
(photo hits floor)

372
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,233
How do you know all this?

373
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:19,933
Because I'm good, Max.
I'm very, very good.

374
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,333
But as good as I am,
there's still some things

375
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:22,600
I don't know about.

376
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:24,100
See, that's where you come in.

377
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:27,633
You're gonna tell me all the
intimate details of your life.

378
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,333
Hell, we got a lot of
catching up to do!

379
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,700
You know, it really is
good to see you.

380
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,900
Now, question number one.

381
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,067
What's on the Jordan schedule
for tonight?

382
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,200
-(gasps)
-(laughs)

383
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:01,067
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

384
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,733
-I'm sorry. Sorry...
-(chuckling)

385
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:04,933
Hey, where's the wine?

386
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,400
-Oh, the wine!
-Max!

387
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:07,533
I forgot. I'm sorry.

388
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,067
-I completely forgot.
-That's all right.

389
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:10,800
We'll pick some up on
the way downtown.

390
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,233
I'll be ready in a minute.

391
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,833
Steven (as Max): Come on. 
 Let's have a little wine,

392
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,267
-shall we? 
-Jackson: A lot of wine.

393
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,400
-This is really good--
-Thank you--

394
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:30,533
What is it?

395
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,333
I think this is called... white.

396
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,367
-Oh, Max--
-Ever the connoisseur.

397
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Honey, would you
make the toast please...

398
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,533
Sure.

399
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,100
To the two of you
leaving Chariot

400
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,733
and starting your own agency.

401
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,067
(chuckles nervously)
Excuse me?

402
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,633
Did you forget to
tell me something, Jacks?

403
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,667
(sighs)

404
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,300
I guess you
didn't tell them yet.

405
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,567
That would be correct.

406
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,333
Ah. Well, here's to
world peace then--

407
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:58,367
Oh, not so fast.

408
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:00,900
When did this come about?

409
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:02,433
Just something
I've been thinking about.

410
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:06,633
Well, I think it's a great idea.
Stu Fishman is a disaster.

411
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:07,800
Hear, hear!

412
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:08,833
-Woo!
-What do ya think?

413
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,067
Uh...

414
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,367
I don't know what to think.

415
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,733
Well, let's let Jacks have his
little breakdown and, uh,

416
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,433
you and I can
go do some girlie things.

417
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,267
Tess:
It's gonna be fine, Jackson.

418
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,433
Steven: Jackson...

419
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,067
Tess: I brought something
special for you.

420
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:26,800
Now, let me understand this.

421
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:30,067
You want to leave Chariot
and start our own company?

422
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,300
If I sign Russo...

423
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:34,567
-...he goes where we go.
-Russo is--

424
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,833
is one guy!

425
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,500
I mean, it's
a little risky starting

426
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:38,667
a company with one client.

427
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,867
We won't though.

428
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:41,767
Don't you think that

429
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,067
the clients that you've
established are gonna follow you

430
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,100
if you open your own place?

431
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:48,167
Jacks, think about all the work
you've put in.

432
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,067
Now, how many years
have you been there now?

433
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,867
-Eight.
-Exactly, eight years.

434
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,300
I've been there five.
It's time that--

435
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,533
-Four.
-Four, five--

436
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,067
It feels like a lifetime
and you know it.

437
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,467
Jacks...

438
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:03,833
Do you want to work for
Stu Fishman

439
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,133
for the rest of your life?

440
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:08,667
What do ya think?

441
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:12,733
I think it's crazy...

442
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,067
...but I wish
I would've thought of it.

443
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:17,600
(chuckling)

444
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,900
Oh, I wanna warn you.

445
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,433
It's "halibut a la Jackson."

446
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,600
Oh...

447
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,067
Boy, Max sure seems
in a good mood tonight.

448
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:27,800
I thought we'd have to spend
the evening cheering him up.

449
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,800
Olivia: I don't know
what's gotten into him.

450
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,833
Mm, well, who knows?

451
00:29:31,867 --> 00:29:34,667
A month from now it could hit
him like a ton of bricks.

452
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,600
Then he'll get into that lovely

453
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:41,067
"anger, bargaining,
depression, guilt..."

454
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:42,767
I can hardly wait.

455
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,867
Tess: Well,

456
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,400
you just let him go
at his own pace.

457
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,900
You prepare yourself
'cause it's gonna rock him.

458
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:51,067
(Steven and Max
chattering)

459
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:57,400
(gasping, groaning)

460
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,033
You okay?

461
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah.

462
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,633
(siren wails in distance)

463
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,767
Are you okay?

464
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:22,900
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

465
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:25,267
I don't know.

466
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,633
It was just...

467
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:29,767
very intense.

468
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,667
Good intense or bad intense?

469
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,933
(exhales)

470
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,200
Good intense.

471
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,533
Definitely...

472
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,100
Definitely good intense.

473
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:43,967
It must've been the wine.

474
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,367
In that case,

475
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,500
you better pick up
a lot for next weekend.

476
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:53,367
(panting)
(chuckling)

477
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,333
(groaning)

478
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,467
(grunting)

479
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:30,067
(struggling)

480
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,900
(breathes heavily)

481
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:19,433
(bleep)

482
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,400
(bleep)

483
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,767
(ringing)

484
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:26,800
Hi, honey.

485
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,067
(muffled groans)

486
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,333
Max?

487
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,867
-(bleeping)
-Olivia: Is that you? Max?

488
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,267
(muffled groans)

489
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,467
(bleeping)

490
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,767
(muffled groaning)

491
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,067
-Max...?
-(line goes dead)

492
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,467
(phone ringing)

493
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,133
Max Jordan's office.

494
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,867
Olivia: Scarlett, is Max in?

495
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,333
Oh yeah, hon. He's right here.
Just a sec.

496
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:55,467
(buzzer)

497
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:00,667
(bleep)

498
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,667
Hi.

499
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,400
Olivia:
 Why'd you hang up on me?

500
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:04,333
Hang up on you?

501
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:07,067
Well, I just got a call
on my private line

502
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,867
but they hung up.
So I assumed it was you.

503
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:11,100
No...

504
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,300
No, it wasn't me.

505
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,267
Ah, it must've been
a wrong number.

506
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,233
So, what are you
doing right now?

507
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,133
Besides thinking about
last night, nothing much.

508
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,600
-Why?
-Well,

509
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,933
I had a buyer cancel on me
so I have the afternoon free.

510
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,767
Steven: The afternoon free...

511
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,533
(clicks tongue)
Mm...

512
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:31,733
Meet you back at the apartment
in 45 minutes?

513
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:33,267
Well, actually I was thinking

514
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,833
this was a really good time
for us to go to the hospital

515
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:37,733
-to visit Aunt Ruth.
-No. No, I can't.

516
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,067
Well, I thought you said 
 you had nothing to do.

517
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:41,400
I don't.

518
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,933
I do, actually.
I actually have a lot to do.

519
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,800
Uh, the Russo situation
has everything, sort of,

520
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,067
piled up here

521
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,733
and I have to take 
 care of this this afternoon.

522
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,567
You know, you haven't
visited her this week.

523
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,200
I know. I know I haven't 
 but I will.

524
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,967
I will see her.

525
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,467
It's just, uh...

526
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,733
There's just too much
to do this afternoon.

527
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:58,900
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

528
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:01,833
All right. Look, um,
it's no big deal.

529
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:03,233
I'll go myself.

530
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:05,133
Well, give her
a big kiss for me.

531
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:07,200
Okay.

532
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,200
Bye.

533
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:11,900
(phone clatters)

534
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,167
(phone clatters)

535
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:18,067
Scarlett,

536
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:20,167
I'm gonna be gone
for the rest of the day.

537
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,767
If my wife calls,

538
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,367
tell her that I'm in a meeting,
all right?

539
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,467
Thank you.

540
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:26,900
(phone ringing in background)

541
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,167
(footsteps approaching)

542
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,900
(scraping)

543
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:53,833
(phone bleeps)

544
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,267
(phone bleeps)

545
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,067
Very good.

546
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:18,167
You're smarter than
I thought you were.

547
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,300
Good genes.

548
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,100
Don't you hate it when
these things die so fast?

549
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:29,367
You're starting to hate me
a bit by now, aren't you?

550
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:36,067
But you see,
hating me only means that

551
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,367
you hate yourself.

552
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:42,933
One thing you'll learn
from this experience is that

553
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:46,700
I've been living inside of you
every single day

554
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:48,567
of your entire life.

555
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,300
Every jab, every insult,
every murderous thought

556
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,300
that you wouldn't allow
yourself to have

557
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,567
was me letting you know
that I'd be back.

558
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,133
That it would all be mine...

559
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:02,267
The wife, the friends,
Uncle Len's money.

560
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,833
It's all going to be mine.

561
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:06,800
Look at me.

562
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,733
I said look at me!

563
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,733
"Man stares into the abyss.

564
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,700
And what does he see?

565
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,800
He sees me, my brother.

566
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,333
He sees me."

567
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,300
Feel better?

568
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,433
Good.

569
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:40,067
Enjoy.

570
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:52,767
Why are you doing this to me?

571
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,867
Why...?

572
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:59,167
Because Maxwell
got the charmed life

573
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,900
and Steven was tossed from
foster home...

574
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,200
...to nuthouse.

575
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:07,067
Oh, bro, the stories
I could tell you.

576
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,200
You know, I spent
my first two years

577
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,700
in the hospital.

578
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,167
I mean, that wasn't too bad.

579
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,733
And then they moved me into
a huge room with 20 other kids.

580
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:14,667
Now that was very uncomfortable.

581
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:20,067
My first foster father used to
love to sneak into bed with me

582
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,267
on those cold winter nights.

583
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,233
And he told me he was gonna burn
the bottom of my feet

584
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:26,433
with a cigarette
if I told anyone.

585
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,800
Do you know my second
foster mother broke my jaw

586
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,467
with a telephone receiver?

587
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,600
What a mother.

588
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:34,967
But that's all in the past, Max.

589
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,300
We're gonna learn about you.

590
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:39,633
You're never gonna
get away with this.

591
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,433
Oh, I already
passed the big test...

592
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,233
Sex with Olivia.

593
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,200
-No.
-Oh, yes indeedy!

594
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:52,933
The proof's all in the pudding.

595
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
(gunshot)

596
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,233
Don't make me kill you.

597
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:00,867
Not just yet anyway.

598
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,933
We got a lot of work to do.

599
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,367
I don't believe that
you were with her.

600
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:09,967
Well, maybe we can make it
so you will.

601
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:12,467
Finish your lunch, Max.

602
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,800
So this means lunch is over?

603
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,533
I guess you gotta sit down now.

604
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,067
You can't pull this off.

605
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,433
You'll never beat me.

606
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:40,200
Never.

607
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:41,800
Please.

608
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,333
I need to know everything, Max.

609
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,967
How you scraped your knee
when you were 12 years old.

610
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,100
How old you were when you
pitched your first no-hitter.

611
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,367
I wanna know when
you lost your virginity

612
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,600
and with whom,

613
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:52,167
and if you've ever seen
that young man again.

614
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:56,167
Just kidding.

615
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:58,633
Then again, maybe not.

616
00:39:58,667 --> 00:39:59,800
That's what I gotta know.

617
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,933
You're insane.

618
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,300
That's what they tell me, Max.

619
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,133
But if we'd been sitting
on different sides of the car,

620
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,567
you'd be standing here
instead of me.

621
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,067
Luck of the draw.

622
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,733
Max, I really need to know
about your relationship

623
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:15,167
with our wife.

624
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,000
You know, favorite
restaurants, anniversaries.

625
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,667
Do you have any kind of

626
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,400
"poopsywoopsy"
name you call her?

627
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,033
Liv...

628
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,600
-Her nickname's Liv.
-Liv!

629
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:31,967
Well, all right!

630
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
All right, now we're
getting somewhere!

631
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:36,133
You see,
I knew this would be fun!

632
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,567
Max, you've got
the best ticket in town.

633
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,400
You get a front row seat
to your own life.

634
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,133
You get to watch me...

635
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,167
...become you.

636
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:20,100
Hey...

637
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:21,833
Hi.

638
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,367
I'm so surprised you're home.

639
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,567
Yeah, I brought my work home.

640
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,233
Didn't want to be stuck
in the office too late.

641
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:27,600
Oh, did you get any dinner?

642
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:29,400
Yeah, I got a pizza from Tony's.

643
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,567
Oh, Tony's?

644
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,700
You hate that place.

645
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,133
You know, it's just a pizza.
You want some?

646
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,167
No, thanks.
I'm too tired to eat.

647
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,400
How'd it go at the hospital?

648
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,200
Okay, I guess.

649
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,633
Well, really the same.

650
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,067
Maybe we should
prepare for the inevitable.

651
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:50,633
The doctor says she's
probably not gonna make it.

652
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:52,067
I'll go by and see her tomorrow.

653
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:53,067
Okay.

654
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:02,567
And I, uh...

655
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,200
saw some photographs.

656
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:05,733
And there's one
I'd never seen before.

657
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:08,900
It was of your Mom and your Dad,
you and your sister, Jennifer,

658
00:42:08,933 --> 00:42:10,433
and then there
was this little boy.

659
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:12,800
See...

660
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:16,400
Oh, that's a neighborhood kid,
Steven. Yeah.

661
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,500
I wonder what happened to him.

662
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:18,700
He looks a lot like you.

663
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:20,067
Yeah.

664
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,300
That's what
everybody used to say.

665
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,900
I find it odd they'd keep
this particular photo.

666
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:29,067
Well, it's probably the only one
that my Dad was smiling in.

667
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,667
Hey, it's so cold in here.

668
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,333
Would you close that window
for me over there?

669
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,500
-I'm freezing.
-Okay.

670
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:34,533
Would you?

671
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:36,133
Please?

672
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:38,867
-Aren't you cold?
-Max...

673
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,467
-What?
-Max!

674
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,900
What? I'm just a little chilly.

675
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:44,067
-Don't you feel it?
-(gasps)

676
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,733
they're beautiful.

677
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,900
Oh.
" Dear Liv,

678
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:52,367
have I told you lately
how much I love you?"

679
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,800
More than words can say.

680
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,067
You're supposed to say,

681
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:04,100
"more than you could
possibly imagine."

682
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:06,300
Well, I guess it
has been a while.

683
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,600
(chuckles)

684
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:10,300
I love you, too.

685
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,567
You know,

686
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,700
these roses remind me of the
ones that you bought me

687
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:16,767
for our honeymoon.

688
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:22,067
Remember how you took off
all the petals?

689
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:22,767
And then...

690
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,967
And then we made love
on a bed of roses...

691
00:43:47,367 --> 00:43:49,167
I want you right here.

692
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,500
Right here by the window.

693
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,067
(sobs)

694
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:32,167
You sure are quiet today.

695
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:36,167
Nothing to say about
last night? Hmm?

696
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,567
Did you enjoy the performance?

697
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,967
Personally,
I think I knocked her socks off.

698
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:46,133
(Steven chuckles)

699
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,067
I gotta tell you, bro,

700
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:50,100
I'm really starting
to enjoy our wife.

701
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,533
You know, just
between the two of us...

702
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:56,533
...I think she likes me.

703
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:02,667
I never thought that
I could be involved with a woman

704
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,900
who's so beautiful, smart,

705
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,133
talented.

706
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:09,433
You know, if she's
as good at her job

707
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:11,133
as she is in the sack,

708
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,233
we got a winner.

709
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,167
Oh, by the way, Max.

710
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,667
You know that restaurant
you told me I liked so much.

711
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,833
Tony's?

712
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:25,100
Well, rumor has it that
I don't like it.

713
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:31,233
Now that would be
considered a lie, hmm?

714
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,067
And I'm warning you, Max,

715
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,867
if you do it again...

716
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,400
if you give me any other

717
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:39,400
bad information...

718
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:43,700
I'm gonna make you bleed.

719
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:47,167
Or better yet...

720
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:50,067
Someone close to you bleeds.

721
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,600
You understand what I'm saying?

722
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,367
Good. Now...

723
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,733
Is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

724
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:03,867
Hmm?

725
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,333
Is there any other

726
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:10,367
bad information
that you want to...

727
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:13,400
...fess up to?

728
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:16,700
No.

729
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,067
Everything I've told you
is true.

730
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,100
Good...

731
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,800
Good.

732
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,133
(monitor bleeps steadily)

733
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,067
(air pumping)

734
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,067
Nurse: Mrs. Jordan?

735
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:41,633
It's okay, Mrs. Jordan.
It's okay. It's okay.

736
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:44,433
You're in the hospital.
You're on a respirator.

737
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,067
I know. I know it's
a bit uncomfortable

738
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:47,833
but we're trying
to make you all better.

739
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,400
Calm down. Stay...
Settle down.

740
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,567
It's okay.

741
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,800
It's okay...

742
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:57,067
(groans faintly)

743
00:46:57,067 --> 00:47:00,933
Oh, let me see what I can find.
Let me see what I can find.

744
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,400
Here, try this.

745
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:22,967
Oh, of course, honey.
I'll get him for you. I promise.

746
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:25,467
(groans in terror)

747
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,567
(phone ringing)

748
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
Hello?

749
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:32,600
What?

750
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:35,367
(gasps)
When?

751
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,367
Yeah...

752
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:39,533
Yeah. Thank you! Thank you!

753
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,167
Max! Max!

754
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,767
That was the hospital.

755
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,500
Aunt Ruth came to last night.

756
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,067
She wants to see you!

757
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,400
She came to?

758
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:49,067
Yeah! She's out of her coma.
She's sleeping now.

759
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,633
We can go visit her
this afternoon.

760
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:51,467
(chuckles)

761
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,067
Honey, I can't
go this afternoon.

762
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:55,333
It's just a nightmare
at the office.

763
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:56,500
But she wants to see you.

764
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:57,967
I'm sure she wants
to talk to you.

765
00:47:58,067 --> 00:48:00,233
Well, I want to talk to her
and I want to see her, too,

766
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:02,300
but I have meetings scheduled
all afternoon today.

767
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,500
Honey...

768
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:05,100
Listen, why don't we
let her rest today, huh?

769
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:08,433
Let her build her strength back
and we'll see her tomorrow.

770
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:11,067
-Okay...
-I'll call you later.

771
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:12,367
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

772
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,233
Hey!
(chuckles)

773
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:21,633
(sighs)

774
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,067
(elevator bell dings)

775
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,900
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

776
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,500
Can I show you something, sir?

777
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:08,367
I'm looking for something
for an anniversary.

778
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,567
Well, did you have anything
particular in mind?

779
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,667
No, not really.

780
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,933
Well, may I suggest
these earrings.

781
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:17,333
They would make
a beautiful anniversary gift.

782
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:23,133
-Beautiful.
-Mm-hmm...

783
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:24,300
Do you think you
could try these on

784
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,833
so I could see them?

785
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,367
-Absolutely.
-Thank you.

786
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,233
-Woman: Put it in a box for me.
-Man: All right.

787
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:33,100
It matches my
necklace perfectly.

788
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:40,300
Man: There you are.
Thank you so much for coming.

789
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:43,067
Well, what do you think?

790
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,533
Very nice.

791
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,133
Shall I wrap these
up for you then?

792
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,800
That matches better.

793
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:01,133
-Like right there.
-All right. Okay...

794
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:02,400
-(phone ringing)
-Okay. Want me to get that?

795
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:03,500
Mm-hmm.

796
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,833
Olivia Jordan's.
May I help you?

797
00:50:08,867 --> 00:50:11,367
Steven: Hello, Marge. 
 Is my wife in?

798
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,600
It's for you.

799
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:15,767
Hello?

800
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,000
Well, hello.

801
00:50:17,033 --> 00:50:18,067
What are you doing?

802
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,967
-Right now?
 -No, next August.

803
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,333
Max, what's going on?

804
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:24,633
Well, why don't
you take a little walk

805
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:26,033
to your window and see.

806
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:33,400
-Not too shabby, huh?
-Oh, Max.

807
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:35,067
You closed the Russo deal!

808
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,400
Better. Better.

809
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,533
What could be better
than closing the Russo deal?

810
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:40,100
Would you just get
down here, please?

811
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:41,200
I'm paying by the hour.

812
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:42,733
Okay. Okay. Okay.

813
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,233
Marge, will you, uh,
close up for me, okay?

814
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:48,300
Sure.

815
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:57,900
-Olivia: What is all this?
-Steven: This is a toast,

816
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:00,800
because three years ago today
I asked you to marry me.

817
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,067
And I have been...

818
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:05,467
...miserably happy ever since.

819
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,067
Three years ago today?

820
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,933
Mm-hmm. March 20th.

821
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:10,367
April 20th.

822
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:13,467
Well, that's not
what I remember.

823
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,967
Max, I'm telling you,
it was April 20th.

824
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:18,433
Remember the baseball game?
We were incredibly cold

825
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:19,767
but you insisted that
we get ice cream,

826
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,767
so I did.
And then when I opened the lid

827
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,867
that's where I found the ring,
stuck in the ice cream.

828
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,333
Does that ring
any bells for you?

829
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:27,367
Don't you remember that?

830
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,333
Sorta. Yeah...

831
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:33,300
Remember how amazed we were

832
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,967
that the ice cream vendor
didn't steal the ring?

833
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:36,733
Yep.

834
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:40,833
Baseball season doesn't
even start till April, Max.

835
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,667
Yeah...

836
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,500
I... I don't ...

837
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,367
I don't know what to say.

838
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:50,400
I guess that means that you,

839
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:52,533
uh, probably won't be
wanting this then, huh?

840
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:55,533
Oh...

841
00:51:56,233 --> 00:51:57,367
(gasps)

842
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:00,500
Oh, it's beautiful.

843
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:03,867
Oh, Max...
(chuckles)

844
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:06,933
Can we afford this?

845
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,600
Baby, after tomorrow night,

846
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:13,067
you'll never have to ask
that question again.

847
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:26,800
-Hi.
-Good evening.

848
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,600
-Reservations for...
-Jordan.

849
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,467
You're Max, right? Max Jordan?

850
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,533
-Yeah.
-You're Stu Fishman's friend?

851
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:36,167
Right. Right. Right.

852
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,300
Why don't I show
you to your table?

853
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:38,700
Thank you.

854
00:52:38,733 --> 00:52:40,067
Stu Fishman's friend?

855
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,667
(piano music plays
in background)

856
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:55,567
-Hostess: Enjoy your dinner.
-Thank you.

857
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,767
Olivia: So, you came here
with Stu Fishman?

858
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,533
Yeah, we had a
quick drink after work.

859
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:00,800
Why didn't you tell me about it?

860
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,800
I didn't think it was
worth mentioning.

861
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:06,600
Max, the guy sneezes at work
and you tell me about it.

862
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:08,100
Well, I guess I forgot.

863
00:53:08,133 --> 00:53:10,067
-Does it matter?
-No. It's just

864
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:11,300
you can't stand him.

865
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,333
You never socialize with him...

866
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:14,833
You're even talking about
leaving the company

867
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:17,067
and all of a sudden
you're drinking buddies?

868
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:18,400
It was one drink.

869
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:31,567
All right.
I'm gonna come clean with you.

870
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,533
I'm seeing Stu Fishman.
I think it's serious.

871
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:35,700
-Max...
-What?

872
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:37,800
What is the big deal?

873
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:38,967
Ah, come on, Liv.

874
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:41,667
This is supposed to be
a celebration, remember?

875
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,067
Of what?

876
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,233
The two year and eleven month
anniversary of our engagement?

877
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:49,500
And why do you keep
calling me Liv all the time?

878
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:50,933
You know how much I hate that.

879
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:56,667
I screwed up the date.

880
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,467
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

881
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,467
Please, that's not
what I'm talking about.

882
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:04,633
Max...

883
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,833
...maybe it's me...

884
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:09,533
...but ever since
Uncle Len died,

885
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:11,267
you've been acting like
a different person.

886
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,667
Len and Ruth were happy, hmm?
They had it all.

887
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,933
The next thing we know,

888
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,867
he shoots himself
and she's in the hospital.

889
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,467
That is a tragedy,
and you and I both know that.

890
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,433
It's also a reality.
And we must face that!

891
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,800
Now I am not gonna sit around

892
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,533
for the rest of my life
and be miserable.

893
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:31,833
And if you think I am,

894
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,433
well maybe you don't
know me very well at all.

895
00:54:33,467 --> 00:54:34,900
I'm going back to the apartment.

896
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:46,167
(door slams)

897
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:55,700
You screwed me
on the anniversary, Max.

898
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:56,800
It's April 20th.

899
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,767
No, no. It's April.

900
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,633
Not March, not May, but April.

901
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,600
I just went through a
whole argument about it.

902
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:06,167
And she hates the name Liv, too.

903
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,067
Or are you too stupid to
remember that?

904
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:14,600
It's gonna cost you, Max.

905
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:17,167
Remember our deal?

906
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,233
Any mistakes you make,

907
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:20,433
someone you care
about dies? Hmm?

908
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:21,633
Remember that?

909
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,133
(siren wails in distance)

910
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:28,733
Who do you think it
might be? Hmm?

911
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:32,800
Well, you'll have plenty
of time to ponder that.

912
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:35,067
If I get a chance
I'll take some photos.

913
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:36,767
We can play a little
show and tell.

914
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:44,600
(indistinct chatter
in background)

915
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,200
(alarm blaring)

916
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:54,467
Man: Get dressed.
Let's go!

917
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,200
Woman (over tannoy):
 Code blue, Unit One.

918
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:58,067
Code blue, Unit One.

919
00:55:58,067 --> 00:56:00,267
(indistinct conversations
in background)

920
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,800
Woman: I'm right behind you.
Let's go.

921
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:04,467
(indistinct, overlapping
conversations)

922
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,933
(alarm stops)

923
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:13,067
(monitor bleeping steadily)

924
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,767
(knocking at door)

925
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,733
Did you call
the hospital back?

926
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,967
No, not yet.

927
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:37,367
You should.
It sounded important.

928
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,900
Hey, Max,
I just got off the phone

929
00:56:38,933 --> 00:56:40,200
with Russo and he's
throwing numbers at me.

930
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:41,300
I don't know
whether he's talking about

931
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,300
triple net deal,
gross lease or what.

932
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,700
What's the story?

933
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:46,600
I haven't had time to
hammer out those details yet.

934
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:49,100
Not according to
the last contract I typed.

935
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:51,267
-Well, which is...?
-Triple net.

936
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,433
Well, it better be because
that's a deal-breaker.

937
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:55,367
No, it's definitely triple net.
Don't worry.

938
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,933
I worry. I get paid to worry.

939
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:59,067
Otherwise Stu comes down on me
about worrying all the time--

940
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,100
Scarlett's right.
It's been triple net all along.

941
00:57:02,133 --> 00:57:03,200
I'll call Russo on it.

942
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:05,100
Okay.

943
00:57:06,933 --> 00:57:08,067
(phone ringing)

944
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:10,067
I'll get that.

945
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,167
Max Jordan's office.

946
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,567
Uh, Scarlett, it's Olivia.

947
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:17,300
Oh, hey, hon. How are ya?

948
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,933
Uh, Ruth...
Ruth died.

949
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:20,200
Can you put Max on?

950
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:22,733
It's Olivia.

951
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:26,333
I'll be outside.

952
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,733
Hey, what's going on?

953
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,167
Max, I... I...

954
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,233
Steven:
 What is it? What's wrong?

955
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:40,100
It's Ruth.

956
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:41,667
I just got a call
from the hospital...

957
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:46,533
She died in her
sleep last night.

958
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:47,767
Oh, no.

959
00:57:48,867 --> 00:57:50,367
Olivia:
 She had some kind of arrest.

960
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,733
But they said
she was getting better.

961
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:55,600
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

962
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,267
You wanna meet me
back at the house?

963
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,833
No, I can't.

964
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,067
What?

965
00:58:01,067 --> 00:58:02,767
I have the Russo
meeting tonight.

966
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:05,167
Well, I--

967
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,167
I'm sure he'd understand
if you canceled.

968
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,367
Olivia...

969
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:11,800
This is very important, 
 and you know that.

970
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,333
-Max--
 -Olivia.

971
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:19,333
I know this seems a bit unusual
but I have to make this dinner.

972
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,500
Now, I'll talk to you 
 when I get home. All right?

973
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,467
Okay.

974
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,600
Okay.

975
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:29,067
(phone bleeps)

976
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,500
(dial tone)

977
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:39,167
(crying)
Oh, God...

978
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:45,900
(sniffs)
(exhales)

979
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,767
(knocking on door)

980
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:53,067
Can I come in?

981
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,733
(bleep)

982
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:57,933
I'm sorry about Aunt Ruth.

983
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,233
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

984
00:59:00,267 --> 00:59:02,800
-I'm worried about you.
-Well, don't worry. I'm fine.

985
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:05,333
I've been thinking about
making you a sign that says:

986
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:07,533
"Why lie? I need a friend."

987
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:08,767
-A what?
-Well, you know,

988
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,800
like the homeless guy?

989
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:12,367
Look, uh,

990
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,067
I know that you've been through
a lot lately.

991
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:18,433
But remember when you said that
man seemed naked and vulnerable?

992
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:20,133
No secrets. Nothing to hide.

993
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:23,967
Well, I think that's
you right now. And--

994
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:25,467
Scarlett.

995
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,967
I don't think this is
the time to go into this.

996
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:30,667
I just hope you consider me
a friend. You know...

997
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,800
I mean, someone you can talk
to if you really need to--

998
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,100
Scarlett,
I'd like you to go out

999
00:59:35,133 --> 00:59:36,667
and close the door behind you.

1000
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,200
Now this is a business,
remember?

1001
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:40,700
I have work to do,
and you have work to do.

1002
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:46,633
I assume you want me to
cancel the Russo dinner.

1003
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:48,733
No. No, you can't do that.

1004
00:59:48,767 --> 00:59:49,933
It's too important.
You know that.

1005
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:51,233
Yeah, um...

1006
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:53,367
Okay.

1007
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,067
(sighing)

1008
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:10,833
(dial tone)

1009
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:14,833
(dialing)

1010
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:27,700
(line ringing)

1011
01:00:30,867 --> 01:00:34,100
Scarlett (over phone):
 Olivia, um, it's me.

1012
01:00:34,133 --> 01:00:35,267
We need to talk.

1013
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,833
Something really weird's 
 going on with Max.

1014
01:00:38,867 --> 01:00:40,667
If you can, 
 would you try to meet me

1015
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,700
tomorrow morning
at nine o'clock?

1016
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:44,033
At the entrance to City Park.

1017
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,767
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

1018
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,200
(line goes dead)

1019
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:52,267
Talk to me.

1020
01:00:53,133 --> 01:00:54,400
Oh, Tess...

1021
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,800
I don't know where to start.

1022
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:59,300
I feel like my whole
world is falling apart.

1023
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:02,233
I don't even know why I'm here.

1024
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:04,667
I mean, what, with Ruth's death
and all that's going on it's--

1025
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,233
Don't beat yourself up.

1026
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:08,967
You know what I really
can't figure out is

1027
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:10,667
what is going on with Max.

1028
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:13,233
Well, what happened last night?

1029
01:01:13,267 --> 01:01:14,467
We had this huge fight

1030
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,600
at Carnegie's and
I walked out on him.

1031
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:18,633
-Oh, no.
-Tess, I'm telling you,

1032
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:21,367
even Scarlett thinks
he's been acting weird.

1033
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,500
So what else?

1034
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,167
Well you know when
you live with someone

1035
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,700
a really long time and
there's certain things

1036
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:27,967
you just know they wouldn't do?

1037
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,800
Well, when Max and I
were first married,

1038
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,467
I pointed out to him
in a crossword puzzle how

1039
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,333
the letters LIV are the same as

1040
01:01:34,367 --> 01:01:36,633
-the Roman numeral 54.
-Mm-hmm.

1041
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:38,500
And since we
live on 54th Street,

1042
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:41,067
-Max started calling me Liv.
-Mm...

1043
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:43,067
And then I told him how
much I hated that nickname,

1044
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,767
and so he stopped.

1045
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,833
And now...

1046
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,967
Now he calls me Liv
all the time.

1047
01:01:49,067 --> 01:01:51,933
This may come off as sounding
like a bunch of psychobabble,

1048
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:54,067
but it could be that the tragedy

1049
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:56,100
has touched some part of his
unconscious that never

1050
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:58,867
dealt with the deaths of
his parents and his sister.

1051
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,700
And maybe for the first time,
he's actually dealing with it.

1052
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:05,133
What should I do?

1053
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:07,900
Well, it's not a quick fix.

1054
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:10,367
Really, all you can do
is just talk to him.

1055
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,133
(sighs)

1056
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:17,367
(piano music plays faintly
in background)

1057
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,400
You're gonna like this,
Scarlett.

1058
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:20,500
-Very nice. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1059
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:21,600
Cheers.
Here's to good luck.

1060
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:22,600
(clinking)

1061
01:02:22,633 --> 01:02:23,733
Here you are.

1062
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:26,400
Hey, hey,

1063
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:27,767
thanks for joining us.
Thanks for joining us--

1064
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,367
-Max, how are ya?
-Good, good, good, Lar.

1065
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,133
Hi, Larry Russo.
I love it.

1066
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,467
You figured the presence of
a beautiful girl's gonna get me

1067
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,800
to sign the contracts, right?

1068
01:02:37,733 --> 01:02:39,500
-What's your name, honey?
-Scarlett.

1069
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:42,367
Scarlett. Really? Like, uh,
 Gone With The Wind ?

1070
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,367
(chuckles nervously)

1071
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:47,200
Do you even work for the agency?

1072
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:48,367
Of course.

1073
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,067
No, the realty agency, honey.

1074
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,100
Larry.

1075
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,767
-Scarlett's my assistant.
-It's okay, Max. I'm fine.

1076
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,267
Yeah, relax, Max.
Who needs who's business here?

1077
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,267
(chuckles)
Right. Exactly.

1078
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,400
I apologize.

1079
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,067
Steven:
Uh, speaking of business,

1080
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:04,700
maybe we ought to get to that
before dinner, huh?

1081
01:03:04,733 --> 01:03:06,733
I brought the, uh,
contracts about the property.

1082
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:09,433
They're fully executed,
and ready for your signature.

1083
01:03:09,467 --> 01:03:10,633
Yeah, those numbers are wrong.

1084
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:11,867
-Excuse me?
-It's a gross deal,

1085
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,067
not triple net.
I'm not signing anything.

1086
01:03:16,267 --> 01:03:19,800
Well, excuse me if I seem
confused but I was under

1087
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,233
the assumption that these
contracts

1088
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:23,067
were very clear all along.

1089
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:24,167
I changed my mind.

1090
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:32,067
(laughs)

1091
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,433
How about that?

1092
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:34,733
Meeting is over and we haven't
even heard the specials?

1093
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,267
Scarlett, could you
give us a minute alone?

1094
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,733
Oh, let her stay.

1095
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:42,167
She's the best thing
you got going for you.

1096
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,067
That's okay. I have to go
to the ladies room--

1097
01:03:44,067 --> 01:03:45,767
No, I'm--
I'm asking you to stay.

1098
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,133
-Please.
-Just for a minute.

1099
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,833
This is how you
do business, Lar?

1100
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:01,767
You know I know a lot about you.

1101
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,500
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1102
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:06,433
I know who you are.
I know where you live.

1103
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:10,200
You and your wife have the nice
five bedroom on Park South.

1104
01:04:10,233 --> 01:04:12,067
Got some cute kids there, too.

1105
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:13,833
How old is Teddy now? Three?

1106
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:17,433
-Yeah.
-Good looking boy too.

1107
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:18,500
You know...

1108
01:04:19,633 --> 01:04:21,067
...that little girl you've been

1109
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:23,533
keeping in that apartment for
the last eight months?

1110
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,200
She's pretty cute, too.

1111
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:27,800
And surprisingly
young, too, Lar.

1112
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:30,233
What is she,
about 18 or so?

1113
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,567
These are the keys
to your house.

1114
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,467
Don't ask me how I got them.
It's not important.

1115
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,900
(keys slam on table)

1116
01:04:36,933 --> 01:04:38,233
I also have a set of keys
to your little girlfriend's

1117
01:04:38,267 --> 01:04:40,467
apartment but I'm sure I won't
have to use those.

1118
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,533
You're crazy.

1119
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,067
I'm gonna need you
to sign these contracts.

1120
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,533
I told you,
those numbers aren't right.

1121
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:48,633
Sign them.

1122
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:53,433
What if I don't?

1123
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:54,600
I'll kill you.

1124
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,333
Here's a pen.

1125
01:05:09,533 --> 01:05:10,667
This'll never hold up in court.

1126
01:05:11,767 --> 01:05:14,067
You'll never live long enough
to get to court.

1127
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,633
Dinner's over, Lar.

1128
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,067
Scarlett: I can't believe 
 you signed Russo.

1129
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:45,700
He was so adamant and
so disgusting.

1130
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,967
Scarlett, you've gotta know
how to handle people like this.

1131
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:49,700
Well, so what
did you say to him?

1132
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:51,300
I told him I was gonna kill him.

1133
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:53,500
Good for you!
Oh, God...

1134
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:54,800
Come on, we've gotta go out

1135
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:56,700
-and celebrate, don't we?
-Oh, I don't know. I'm--

1136
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:58,067
-I'm kinda tired.
-Scarlett,

1137
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:59,467
we've just signed Russo.

1138
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,633
You know what that means?
Has that sunk into you yet?

1139
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,167
-Uh, Max, I--
-I tell you what, we'll go up,

1140
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,700
we'll call Olivia and maybe
she'll come out and meet us

1141
01:06:04,733 --> 01:06:06,167
for a drink. Huh?
Come on.

1142
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,767
-Okay.
-Good.

1143
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,900
-We've gotta do something.
-All right.

1144
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,833
Steven:...never seen anything
like it.

1145
01:06:16,867 --> 01:06:17,867
Scarlett: Yeah, right.

1146
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,867
Uh, the phone's
right over there.

1147
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,867
This is a nice place
here you got here.

1148
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,267
I haven't changed anything
in the past two weeks.

1149
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,700
(chuckles)

1150
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:31,067
Let's give Olivia a call.

1151
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,333
What are you doing?

1152
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,933
I...
I wanna...

1153
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:44,533
I wanna ask you something
and I want you to be...

1154
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,700
I want you to be perfectly
honest with me.

1155
01:06:49,933 --> 01:06:52,567
-Have you ever thought about us?
-What do you mean?

1156
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,333
I mean,

1157
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,267
have you ever thought
about us...

1158
01:06:58,133 --> 01:06:59,200
...sexually?

1159
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,533
Uh... uh, Max,
this is a bad idea.

1160
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:05,400
We should just call it a night.

1161
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,367
You're a very pretty girl.

1162
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,233
Stop it. You're scaring me.

1163
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:13,100
Well, what's there
to be afraid of?

1164
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:14,967
I just wanna be with you.

1165
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:17,633
-I think you should leave.
-What's the matter?

1166
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:20,600
-Not interested in me?
-No, no. It's not that.

1167
01:07:20,633 --> 01:07:21,833
-It's just that you--
-If it was my brother

1168
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:23,533
you'd probably be all over him?
-What?

1169
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:25,667
You think he's pretty special,
don't you?

1170
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,233
(cries out)

1171
01:07:27,267 --> 01:07:29,067
(screams)

1172
01:07:32,067 --> 01:07:33,800
(crying)

1173
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:35,233
No!

1174
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:37,967
No!

1175
01:07:40,133 --> 01:07:41,433
(screaming stops)

1176
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:46,500
(panting)

1177
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,633
(shutter clicking)

1178
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,800
Max's little girl...

1179
01:08:07,733 --> 01:08:09,967
(shutter clicking)

1180
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,567
Steven's voice: Oh, that's 
 the neighborhood kid, Steven.

1181
01:08:29,133 --> 01:08:30,400
(keys jingling)

1182
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:38,433
-Hi.
-Hi.

1183
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,600
Still love me?

1184
01:08:41,633 --> 01:08:42,833
(sighs)

1185
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:44,667
Yeah, of course...

1186
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,067
Sure you do,

1187
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:49,067
now that I'm filthy,
stinking rich.

1188
01:08:50,067 --> 01:08:52,067
You can't resist me, right?
(claps)

1189
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,067
You closed the Russo deal?

1190
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,300
I closed the Russo deal.

1191
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,067
So, how do you wanna celebrate?

1192
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,467
I don't know.

1193
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:05,333
You want to go out?

1194
01:09:05,367 --> 01:09:06,367
No.

1195
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:09,300
I'll call Tess and Jacks.

1196
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:11,167
They'll be really happy--

1197
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,467
(groans)

1198
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,500
I don't think so.

1199
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,567
God, I want you.

1200
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,633
(gasping)

1201
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:32,933
You know, it's really
very difficult to choose.

1202
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:36,367
In my opinion,
I think they're all great.

1203
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,167
(line ringing)

1204
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:51,600
Scarlett (over voicemail):
 Hi. This is Scarlett.

1205
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:53,067
I'm not home right now,

1206
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:54,500
but leave your name 
 and number at the tone.

1207
01:09:54,533 --> 01:09:55,233
(bleep)

1208
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:58,333
I'll tell you what,
Max, you be the judge, huh?

1209
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:02,100
Oh, um,

1210
01:10:02,733 --> 01:10:04,600
I'm sorry about Aunt Ruth.

1211
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,800
She...

1212
01:10:08,433 --> 01:10:10,400
She was getting better.

1213
01:10:10,433 --> 01:10:11,567
Well, we just
couldn't have that.

1214
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:19,633
Now, Max, as I told you,
I'm a man of my word, right?

1215
01:10:19,667 --> 01:10:21,633
And you did break the rules.

1216
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:22,733
But if you can't
count on family,

1217
01:10:22,767 --> 01:10:23,933
who can you count on?

1218
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:34,067
(screaming)

1219
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,167
Well, Max.

1220
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,233
I can have duplicates
made if you like. Hmm?

1221
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,400
I don't think I've ever
seen Scarlett looking better.

1222
01:10:52,033 --> 01:10:55,700
Oh... well I'll go
get a few others.

1223
01:10:55,733 --> 01:10:56,967
Maybe you'll like those better.

1224
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:15,267
(dialing)

1225
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:19,567
(ringing)

1226
01:11:22,867 --> 01:11:24,400
-Max Jordan.
-(hangs up)

1227
01:11:25,433 --> 01:11:27,233
(dial tone)

1228
01:11:34,367 --> 01:11:36,067
Hey, Max, buddy.

1229
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:37,533
-You got a moment?
-Sure, Stu.

1230
01:11:45,633 --> 01:11:47,067
-Yes, Stu?
-There he is!

1231
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:48,400
He's the man!

1232
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:49,333
There you go.

1233
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,933
Max, I am so pleased about you
closing Russo last night.

1234
01:11:53,967 --> 01:11:56,600
You know how much we had riding
on this as a company.

1235
01:11:56,633 --> 01:11:57,733
You came through like a trooper.

1236
01:11:57,767 --> 01:11:58,833
Thanks, Stu.

1237
01:11:58,867 --> 01:12:00,767
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Jacks.

1238
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
Max...

1239
01:12:03,133 --> 01:12:06,200
I was gonna wait a while before
I said anything about this but

1240
01:12:06,233 --> 01:12:07,800
somehow this seems
like the right time.

1241
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:11,733
I want to offer you a full

1242
01:12:11,767 --> 01:12:13,600
partnership in
Chariot Real Estate.

1243
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:14,733
What do you say?

1244
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:16,800
A partnership?

1245
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:20,733
(chuckles)

1246
01:12:21,533 --> 01:12:22,700
I don't know what to say.

1247
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,867
-I'd be honored.
-Well, good!

1248
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,067
Good, good!

1249
01:12:27,633 --> 01:12:28,700
Excuse me.

1250
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,867
-What's the matter with him?
-I don't know.

1251
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,200
I thought he'd be happy for me.

1252
01:12:36,967 --> 01:12:38,233
Well, what are we doing'
wasting time here, huh?

1253
01:12:38,267 --> 01:12:40,600
We've got a company
to run... partner.

1254
01:12:40,633 --> 01:12:41,067
You said it.

1255
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,600
Man: I'm sorry but the dates you 
 asked for appear to be missing.

1256
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:47,200
No.

1257
01:12:47,233 --> 01:12:49,400
Well... where else
I can find them?

1258
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:51,600
If you want me to I could check
the data base for you.

1259
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,067
Oh, yeah. That'd be great.

1260
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:00,700
Um, let's see, uh...

1261
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:03,767
suburban newspapers...

1262
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:08,600
Marge, how's it going?

1263
01:13:08,633 --> 01:13:10,833
Max. Good to see you.

1264
01:13:10,867 --> 01:13:13,533
I'm looking for
the love of my life, Marge.

1265
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:15,467
You know where I might find her?

1266
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,067
Uh, no. I'm not
sure where she is.

1267
01:13:18,067 --> 01:13:19,900
I think she went to
do some banking.

1268
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:21,067
Banking...

1269
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:25,500
You tell her I came by.
Have her call me.

1270
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,933
I'll tell her.

1271
01:13:28,967 --> 01:13:30,300
(bleeping)

1272
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,433
Thank you.

1273
01:13:37,433 --> 01:13:40,700
"Max Jordan miraculously
survived the crash while...

1274
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,533
...while his twin brother
Steven Jordan

1275
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:46,933
remains in critical condition.

1276
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:49,333
Both were taken
to Memorial Hospital."

1277
01:13:53,067 --> 01:13:55,333
(line ringing)

1278
01:13:55,367 --> 01:13:57,067
Olivia (over voicemail): Olivia 
 and Max aren't here right now

1279
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,633
so please leave a message 
 and we'll call you back.

1280
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:00,867
Bye.

1281
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,867
(bleeps)
(dials number)

1282
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,967
Please. I drove all
the way over here.

1283
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:11,500
I can't let you see the files--

1284
01:14:11,533 --> 01:14:13,567
No, but if there's anybody
I need to talk to, I will.

1285
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,833
Only doing my job.
Sorry.

1286
01:14:25,067 --> 01:14:27,100
Look, my husband's
on his death bed, okay.

1287
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:29,533
And I need his medical records.
What is it with you people?

1288
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:30,633
I'm sorry.

1289
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:36,633
It's just that he's gotta get
a kidney transplant and...

1290
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,867
I can't locate his brother.

1291
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,300
I just don't want to lose him.

1292
01:14:43,467 --> 01:14:44,833
What's your husband's name?

1293
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:47,867
Max.

1294
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,300
Maxwell Jordan.

1295
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:51,400
Jordan?

1296
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,400
You knew him?

1297
01:14:54,433 --> 01:14:56,500
Well, that was such a sad case.

1298
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:57,967
The Aunt and Uncle
were devastated

1299
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,800
they couldn't take the brother.

1300
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,400
Oh, yeah.

1301
01:15:01,433 --> 01:15:03,400
Oh, it must have been
awful for them.

1302
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:06,133
But you know, little Steven
was severely injured.

1303
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:08,567
They just didn't have the money
to pay for those operations.

1304
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:11,700
Let me see
if I can find that file.

1305
01:15:15,467 --> 01:15:16,967
Marge: Olivia Jordan's office.

1306
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:18,200
Marge, it's Max.

1307
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:20,100
Has Olivia gotten back
to the office yet?

1308
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:21,933
No, not yet.

1309
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:23,333
Has she called in?

1310
01:15:23,367 --> 01:15:25,767
No. I should be hearing 
 from her soon.

1311
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,067
Thanks, Marge.

1312
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:29,367
(bleeps)

1313
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,067
Ah, Jordan.

1314
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:38,900
Wait.

1315
01:15:40,067 --> 01:15:41,167
It isn't here.

1316
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,333
I've never lost a file.
I can't believe it.

1317
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:45,867
Oh, no...

1318
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,500
That's the strangest thing.

1319
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,200
You may want to try
the welfare office.

1320
01:15:51,233 --> 01:15:52,500
You know,
little Steven was placed

1321
01:15:52,533 --> 01:15:54,067
in several foster homes.

1322
01:15:54,067 --> 01:15:55,900
They might be able to help you.

1323
01:15:55,933 --> 01:15:58,233
Okay.
Thank you.

1324
01:15:58,267 --> 01:15:59,533
Thank you very much.

1325
01:16:04,533 --> 01:16:05,867
(dials number)

1326
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:13,933
(phone ringing)

1327
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:20,667
(exhales)

1328
01:16:25,933 --> 01:16:27,233
This is so weird.

1329
01:16:27,267 --> 01:16:29,133
The entire file is missing.

1330
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,533
Fingerprints,
last known address,

1331
01:16:30,567 --> 01:16:32,800
the whole bit.
I don't know...

1332
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:35,067
Okay, um, is...
is there any way that I can

1333
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,667
-speak to the Johnsons?
-Yeah, sure.

1334
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,267
I know the wife.
The Johnsons

1335
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,833
have taken a lot of kids in
over the years.

1336
01:16:41,867 --> 01:16:43,067
Wait a second...

1337
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,067
I don't believe it!

1338
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,233
It's not here!

1339
01:16:48,267 --> 01:16:49,300
Oh, wait.

1340
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:52,367
I have it in my address book.

1341
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:54,433
Johnson. Here it is.

1342
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,833
Thank you very much.

1343
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:05,567
(bleeps)

1344
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:09,767
Hi, Marge. Did Max call?

1345
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,467
He was here looking for you.

1346
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,067
I didn't know what to tell him.
I said you were at the bank...

1347
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,367
Hope that's okay.

1348
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,433
Okay.

1349
01:17:16,467 --> 01:17:18,467
Thanks. Yeah,
I'll talk to you later.

1350
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
Bye.

1351
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:26,433
Olivia...?!

1352
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,367
-Olivia!
-(clattering)

1353
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,600
Mrs. Johnson?

1354
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:50,267
Are you the woman the
welfare worker called about?

1355
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,567
I'm Olivia Jordan.

1356
01:17:52,433 --> 01:17:54,267
I'm looking for Steven Jordan.

1357
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,133
I haven't seen that boy
in 15 years or better...

1358
01:17:57,167 --> 01:17:58,467
not that I've tired looking.

1359
01:17:59,533 --> 01:18:01,700
Uh, what do you mean?

1360
01:18:01,733 --> 01:18:04,933
Well, to honest with you,
he was no angel.

1361
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:06,367
That's not to say
he's still like that,

1362
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,533
but, uh...

1363
01:18:07,567 --> 01:18:09,067
But what?

1364
01:18:10,067 --> 01:18:12,700
Look, I don't really
want to get involved.

1365
01:18:12,733 --> 01:18:13,833
Have a good day.

1366
01:18:13,867 --> 01:18:15,533
Wait, wait.

1367
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:18,067
Mrs. Johnson, please.

1368
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,567
Isn't there anything that you
can tell me about him?

1369
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,667
Look, Mrs. Jordan,

1370
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,900
I don't know what you want
and I don't know what you need,

1371
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:26,533
but I'll say this:

1372
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:28,333
some stones are better
left unturned.

1373
01:18:29,633 --> 01:18:32,800
And if you are unfortunate
enough to find him,

1374
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,367
I'd be careful if I were you.

1375
01:18:44,267 --> 01:18:47,067
Tess, I'm telling you.
I've been sensing it all week.

1376
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:48,667
I mean, everything
he does is just

1377
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,500
a little bit off...

1378
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:54,067
The anniversary, my nickname,
his reaction to Ruth's recovery.

1379
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:57,167
His reaction to Ruth's death.
It isn't Max.

1380
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,167
Even the sex is...

1381
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,433
It's different, you know.

1382
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:02,367
It's so intense
it's almost scary.

1383
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:05,067
So what are you saying?

1384
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,233
(sighs)

1385
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:11,500
Max has a twin brother.

1386
01:19:13,533 --> 01:19:15,800
He survived the crash
and he's still alive.

1387
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,633
He has a twin?

1388
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:21,267
Look, I know this might sound
bizarre, but...

1389
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,833
what if he somehow switched
places with my husband?

1390
01:19:23,867 --> 01:19:25,267
Okay.

1391
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,533
It's very normal when you're
grieving to make things--

1392
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:28,833
Tess, Tess, look. You know me!

1393
01:19:28,867 --> 01:19:30,367
You know how close
I am with Max!

1394
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,367
I can feel this!

1395
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,633
Even Jackson noticed it.
Scarlett noticed it, too--

1396
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:37,600
Olivia, you are my best friend
and I love you dearly.

1397
01:19:37,633 --> 01:19:39,633
But I think you're way out of
the ballpark on this.

1398
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:42,800
I know.
I know I must sound crazy.

1399
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:45,833
There's gotta be some
explanation for this.

1400
01:19:45,867 --> 01:19:50,400
When was the last time that
I know I was with my husband?

1401
01:19:53,267 --> 01:19:54,767
It was the night of the funeral.

1402
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,200
It was the night of the funeral,

1403
01:19:57,233 --> 01:19:59,333
and I definitely woke up with
him the next morning.

1404
01:19:59,367 --> 01:20:01,633
We have to go back to that day.
We have to go back to that day

1405
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:03,567
and find out
every single thing he did.

1406
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,500
I want to go to his office.

1407
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,967
Okay.

1408
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:14,267
Let's go.

1409
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,633
Olivia: Take a right. His
parking space is right there.

1410
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,233
There's his parking space. Stop.

1411
01:20:23,267 --> 01:20:24,467
Stop, stop, stop.

1412
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,567
Okay, good. He's not here.

1413
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,933
We're okay.

1414
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:29,067
Park over there.

1415
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,900
(elevator bell dings)

1416
01:20:57,567 --> 01:21:00,267
Okay, you stay out here
and keep watch.

1417
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,433
I'll be right out.

1418
01:21:22,567 --> 01:21:23,933
(exhales)

1419
01:21:33,067 --> 01:21:34,400
East 54th Street?

1420
01:21:37,433 --> 01:21:38,600
(loudly)
Max!

1421
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:41,533
Max, how are you?

1422
01:21:41,567 --> 01:21:43,067
Tess, well...

1423
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,233
...to what do I owe
this pleasure?

1424
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:49,133
Oh, just looking for Jackson.
Not here, huh?

1425
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:50,933
No. No, I guess not.

1426
01:21:51,633 --> 01:21:52,800
Do you know where my wife is?

1427
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:55,467
No. No, I haven't seen her.

1428
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,400
Hey, you know, I've been
meaning to ask you,

1429
01:21:58,433 --> 01:22:00,067
how have you been,

1430
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:02,667
you know, with everything
that's happened and all?

1431
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,733
Fine.

1432
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:05,400
Everything's fine.

1433
01:22:07,633 --> 01:22:09,733
Well, I wouldn't worry about
her too much.

1434
01:22:09,767 --> 01:22:12,567
I mean, she was fine
at the art gallery last night.

1435
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,667
I mean, other than,
um, you know,

1436
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,067
being upset about Aunt Ruth.

1437
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,533
Yeah. Right, right.

1438
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:19,700
Well, if you hear from her

1439
01:22:19,733 --> 01:22:21,167
would you have her
call me, please?

1440
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,633
-Of course.
-Thanks, Tess.

1441
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:24,800
Max...

1442
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:26,433
Oh, hey, there you are.

1443
01:22:26,467 --> 01:22:27,867
I didn't expect
to find you here.

1444
01:22:28,767 --> 01:22:29,233
Honey, what...

1445
01:22:30,433 --> 01:22:32,767
-...what are you doing' here?
-I was just looking for you.

1446
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,800
What's the matter with you?

1447
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:36,667
Stu just got a call
from the police.

1448
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:39,467
Scarlett's dead.

1449
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,333
She was murdered last night.
They, uh...

1450
01:22:42,367 --> 01:22:43,600
...they just found her body.

1451
01:22:43,633 --> 01:22:45,867
-Oh, my God.
-When did this happen?

1452
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,300
-I don't-- I don't know.
-The police are trying

1453
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:48,400
to figure it out.

1454
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:52,900
I can't-- I can't believe this.

1455
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:57,800
Max, I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry.

1456
01:23:01,933 --> 01:23:05,133
Um, I'll go make
the phone calls and stuff.

1457
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:14,633
You really should go home now.

1458
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,233
Yeah, you're right.

1459
01:23:18,767 --> 01:23:20,067
I should go home.

1460
01:23:29,967 --> 01:23:32,067
(door opening)

1461
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:51,300
Hello, Max.

1462
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:54,600
How was your day?

1463
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,300
I hope it's been
better than mine.

1464
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:02,800
I'm not having a very good one.

1465
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,467
We're gonna change
clothes now, Max.

1466
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:20,800
You know, Mother always said
we had to learn to share.

1467
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,200
We'd better hurry.
Time's wasting.

1468
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,800
Our anniversary dinner.
Our anniv--

1469
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,767
Our anniversary dinner
was on March 20th.

1470
01:24:56,533 --> 01:24:58,100
March, the third month.

1471
01:24:58,133 --> 01:25:00,733
320. 320 East 54th Street.

1472
01:25:01,767 --> 01:25:03,067
That's it.

1473
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:06,900
(tires screech)

1474
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,267
It's been nice getting
to know you, Max.

1475
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:35,967
I can't tell you what the past
few days have meant to me.

1476
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,233
My existence was kept
a secret from you.

1477
01:25:45,867 --> 01:25:49,067
I'm just sorry I had to be the
one to introduce myself first.

1478
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:54,967
Our worlds have
always been apart...

1479
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,367
...and now we must part again.

1480
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,800
(siren wails in background)

1481
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,067
I'm letting you go.

1482
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,067
I can't do this anymore.

1483
01:26:55,367 --> 01:26:56,400
Do it.

1484
01:26:58,433 --> 01:26:59,633
That's what you'd like,
isn't it?

1485
01:27:07,067 --> 01:27:08,133
Do it.

1486
01:27:10,367 --> 01:27:12,067
I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1487
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:15,467
You're sick.

1488
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,633
Sick!

1489
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,800
You sick bastard!

1490
01:27:23,933 --> 01:27:25,067
I swear...

1491
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,300
(screams)

1492
01:27:49,067 --> 01:27:50,267
(cocks gun)
Don't move!

1493
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:52,233
Olivia...

1494
01:27:53,733 --> 01:27:55,133
Olivia, it's me.

1495
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:56,567
I said don't move!

1496
01:27:57,233 --> 01:27:58,467
Where's my husband?

1497
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:07,833
I'm your husband.

1498
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,233
It's me, Max.

1499
01:28:11,267 --> 01:28:12,567
Stay away from me!

1500
01:28:13,533 --> 01:28:14,800
I know everything.

1501
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,067
I know who you are!

1502
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:20,100
You've got to believe me,
Olivia.

1503
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:21,200
No...

1504
01:28:24,567 --> 01:28:25,700
Max!

1505
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:27,500
Olivia...

1506
01:28:27,533 --> 01:28:28,567
Oh, my God!

1507
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,900
Look what he's done to me.

1508
01:28:31,467 --> 01:28:32,933
Olivia, don't believe him.

1509
01:28:34,167 --> 01:28:35,467
It's me.

1510
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,167
I swear to you, it's me.

1511
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,267
He set this up!

1512
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,533
Stay away from me!

1513
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:46,100
Olivia, our honeymoon in Venice,

1514
01:28:46,133 --> 01:28:47,333
do you remember what happened
to our luggage?

1515
01:28:47,367 --> 01:28:49,167
-No.
-They lost it.

1516
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,600
And we bought
those funny shirts.

1517
01:28:50,633 --> 01:28:51,700
Stop!

1518
01:28:51,733 --> 01:28:53,433
And we rented that car
and we drove out

1519
01:28:53,467 --> 01:28:55,567
to the countryside and
I bought you those roses.

1520
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,300
-Just stop it!
-Do you remember the roses?

1521
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:00,367
What we did with the roses?
We made love...

1522
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,433
We made love on a bed of roses.

1523
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,100
(struggling)

1524
01:30:03,967 --> 01:30:06,500
No!

1525
01:30:06,533 --> 01:30:07,533
(gunshot)

1526
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,767
Male voice: Olivia!

1527
01:30:28,133 --> 01:30:29,367
Man: Champagne for everyone.

1528
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,133
Here we are. Here we go.

1529
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:32,533
No, no, no.
Orange juice for me.

1530
01:30:32,567 --> 01:30:33,800
-Oh, that's right.
-What are you thinking?

1531
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:34,900
-Huh?
-You tried to poison

1532
01:30:34,933 --> 01:30:35,967
-our Godchild?
-This is my baby, here.

1533
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,033
She's gotta have her vitamins...

1534
01:30:37,067 --> 01:30:38,567
There we go.
Let's have a toast

1535
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,300
to a successful venture.

1536
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:41,733
Hear, hear.

1537
01:30:41,767 --> 01:30:44,100
I'd like to make
a special toast if I could.

1538
01:30:44,133 --> 01:30:45,833
To good fortune...

1539
01:30:47,267 --> 01:30:48,400
...to good friends...

1540
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:54,033
...and to the family
I never thought that I'd have.

1541
01:30:54,067 --> 01:30:55,100
(gushes)
