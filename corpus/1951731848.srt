Sort of like a time-out.

Okay, so what Cummings
is saying here

309
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:23,362
is that he's using
the parentheses as a metaphor

310
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:30,178
to say that death actually
is not a time-out,

311

00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:53,132
Do you plan to?

555
00:47:57,389 --> 00:47:58,411
I don't know.

556
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,981
Hey.

557
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:28,069
Hey.

558
00:48:28,078 --> 00:48:29,540
You're home early.

559
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,048
Don't you got enough of me
at night?

560
00:48:34,025 --> 00:48:35,847
Rose is seeing
somebody else.

561
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:40,615
Oh, Mark,
I'm so sorry.

562
00:48:43,784 --> 00:48:44,487
I don't know
what to do.

563
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:47,362
<i>She's making</i>

564
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:49,090
A big mistake.

565
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,767
Maybe.

566
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:55,586
What's that
supposed to mean?

567
00:48:55,596 --> 00:48:57,057
It's her life.

568
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,017
You think
this is okay?

569
00:48:58,027 --> 00:48:59,073
I don't know.

570
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,538
She's the one
that's got to find out.

571
00:49:01,547 --> 00:49:03,297
Find what out?

572
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,409
You want me
to read your tarot?

573
00:49:05,418 --> 00:49:07,520
[laughs]

574
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,705
No, Claire,
I don't want you

575
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:10,848
To read my tarot
or break out your ouija board

576
00:49:10,858 --> 00:49:12,480
or stick pins
into a doll

577
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,632
or whatever the hell else
it is

578
00:49:13,641 --> 00:49:14,848

579
00:49:14,857 --> 00:49:16,160
That's not necessary.

580
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:17,664
That's my next
appointment.

581
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:18,976
You want to know
the truth, Mark?

582
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:21,983
And this is just
sister to brother talking.

583
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:23,776
You're really
judgmental sometimes.

584
00:49:23,785 --> 00:49:25,087
Is that right?

585
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:27,359
I'm just trying
to be honest.

586
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:29,598
You take people's money
to tell their future,

587
00:49:29,608 --> 00:49:31,774
and you're gonna lecture me
on honesty, huh?

588
00:49:31,784 --> 00:49:32,767
Great.

589
00:49:32,776 --> 00:49:33,410

Hi, I've been receiving

593
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:53,660
your catalogue every week.

594
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,284
And I just really wish that
you would stop sending it to me.

595
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,596
<i>What's the customer number?</i>

596
00:49:57,605 --> 00:49:59,355
<i>It's highlighted
in yellow on the back.</i>

597
00:49:59,365 --> 00:50:02,555
Kh789.

598
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:04,123
<i>You've ordered
a few products from us.</i>

599
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:05,787
I don't think so.

603

Stop. I know what I ordered.

604
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,274
<i>Well, did your child
like the toys?</i>

605
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:18,266
He liked them a lot.

606
00:50:18,275 --> 00:50:20,926
I just--I don't
need them anymore.

607
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,385
<i>I'll take you off the list.</i>

608
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,285
Thank you.

What's going on?

617
00:51:36,695 --> 00:51:37,938
Come on, Mark.

618
00:51:37,947 --> 00:51:39,953
I'm really unhappy
about this.

619
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,418
You're bringing
a negative vibe into my space.

620
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:44,273
<i>My wife's out there

621
00:51:44,283 --> 00:51:45,873

in this bogus,
idealized world you inhabit.

626
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,463
It's not bogus.

627
00:51:56,473 --> 00:51:57,679
It's real.

628
00:51:57,689 --> 00:51:58,864
And it's hard-earned.

629
00:51:58,873 --> 00:52:00,527
[laughing]

630
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:01,808
So what am I supposed to do,

631
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:04,240
Just kick back and relax

632

You know, I don't think
this is about Rose.

635
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:12,754
I never hear you talk
about Casey.

636
00:52:20,114 --> 00:52:21,229
Fuck off, Claire.

637
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,861
Is that how you talk
to Rose?

638
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:24,273
What could you possibly know
about losing a child, eh?

639
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,533
I know more
than you think.

640
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:28,652
You don't have
any clue.

641
00:52:28,662 --> 00:52:30,032
You have absolutely
no clue.

642
00:52:31,569 --> 00:52:32,912
I've had
two miscarriages.

643
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:35,052
Not the same.

<i>I wanted
those babies.</i>

645
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,347
They were fetuses,
Claire.

Fetuses, okay?

647
00:52:40,885 --> 00:52:42,699
Casey was two.

658

What were we?

659
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:51,589
Must have been 24, 25.

660
00:53:51,598 --> 00:53:52,900
And it started to pour so bad

661
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:54,660
we ducked into
that little shoe store.

662
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,571
<i>And you tried on these
beautiful italian sandals,</i>

663

<i>and I kept telling you
that they were too expensive.</i>

664

<i>You looked absolutely beautiful

She's from Puerto Rico.

You hesitated.

about what's happening
to you.

707
00:56:39,773 --> 00:56:40,915

You guess?

709
00:56:43,357 --> 00:56:45,075
Do you think it'll change
her opinion of me?

710
00:56:45,085 --> 00:56:46,707
Probably not.

711
00:56:46,717 --> 00:56:48,279

finds out?

712
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:50,674

Oh, damn it.

926
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:21,926
Excuse me, sir?

927
01:20:21,936 --> 01:20:23,207
What is it?

928
01:20:23,216 --> 01:20:24,167
What do you want?

929
01:20:24,176 --> 01:20:25,126
Do you need help?

930
01:20:25,136 --> 01:20:25,897
Leave me alone.

931
01:20:33,866 --> 01:20:35,205
Excuse me, please.

932
01:20:35,215 --> 01:20:37,989
Yeah, yeah?

933
01:20:37,998 --> 01:20:40,708
I need to get
to the M-train to Queens.

934
01:20:40,718 --> 01:20:42,532
Like, I'm going
to Booth Street.

935
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:46,180
Um, you got to take
the 1-train to Times Square.

936
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:47,496
But you got to get on
the other side.

937
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,859
Can you help me?

938
01:20:57,869 --> 01:20:59,363
Yeah.

939
01:20:59,372 --> 01:21:00,323
Yeah, come on.

940
01:21:00,332 --> 01:21:01,894
It's this way.

941
01:21:06,982 --> 01:21:07,938
What's your name?

942
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:09,218
Simon.

943
01:21:09,227 --> 01:21:10,178
What about you?

944
01:21:10,187 --> 01:21:11,489
Simon. My name
is Tommaso, Simon.

945
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:12,545
Tommas.
What is that?

946
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:14,497
Thank you.
Tommaso is an Italian name.

947
01:21:14,506 --> 01:21:15,713
Italian.

948
01:21:15,722 --> 01:21:18,113
What, but you got
a really thick New York accent.

949
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,712
I've been in New York
since a long time now.

950
01:21:19,722 --> 01:21:20,705
A long time.

951
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:23,296
I'm going to see
my friend, Isabel.
