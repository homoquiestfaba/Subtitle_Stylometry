1
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:34,073
Out of there. We wanna swim.

2
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,238
We do the wash. sir.
There's soap in the water.

3
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:41,976
Don't bother me none.
I could use a bath.

4
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,774
You hear me? Out of there.
Get them out of there.

5
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,436
Mary. Jesse. Come on.

6
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,773
Need a little encouragement.

7
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,972
They're scaled. sir. They can't move.

8
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,943
Well, they better learn quick.
Come on, Negress! Swim for it!

9
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,909
Oh. Lord.

10
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,503
Mary. Jesse. come on.

11
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,876
- What's going on here?
- Just teaching your niggels some manners.

12
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:12,446
That's not your place.
You harm them and you'll pay lo! them.

13
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,102
Come on. Jesse.

14
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:16,804
For God's sake. Jackson.
it was only sport.

15
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,140
We don't make sport with our slaves.

16
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,075
No, you love your niggers.

17
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:25,477
Wesley, I will make you sorry
if you ever bother one of our slaves again.

18
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,146
- Nigger lover.
- Look out, master.

19
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,079
Get up.

20
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,840
Get up. Wes.

21
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,403
Now. come on.

22
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,905
Take ii. son.

23
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:55,373
That's how it is with nigger lovers.

24
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,012
That's light.

25
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:13,676
I wasn't ready for the others.
Suppose I should've been.

26
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,814
Why, you whipped them good
lots of times, master.

27
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:20,073
That boy just ain't never gonna learn.
that's all.

28
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,310
A wedding. she says.

29
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:34,448
Nothing but a charade and a fiasco.

30
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,672
Just so a couple of Negroes
can jump over the broom.

31
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,905
I feel faint just thinking about it.

32
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:46,273
To think that the president's
daughter-in-law could do such a thing.

33
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,504
Well, that's Yankees for you.

34
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:52,274
- Sarah's hardly a Yankee.
- Well, she might as well be.

35
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:55,937
Mixing slaves and white folk
at a social event.

36
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,410
Can you imagine?

37
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,843
Good afternoon, ladies.
Is that your son, James?

38
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,343
Yes.

39
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:06,607
Well. he's a fine young man.

40
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,940
Best keep him out of my Lizzie's sight.
She's got her eye out for a beau.

41
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,943
Your brother's so handsome.

42
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,081
Last time I saw him
he was all gangly and spotty.

43
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:20,708
- Why doesn't he come talk to us?
- Oh. he's probably been in a fight.

44
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:23,211
Happens a lot.
He likes to pretend we don't know...

45
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,711
...so Easter cleans him up
and mends his clothes.

46
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:28,279
- Easter?
- Slave girl. She does all the weaving.

47
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:29,969
Oh. is that all?

48
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,945
Whoa.

49
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,778
- See to the horses.
- Yes. sir.

50
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,971
Easter? My shirt needs mending.

51
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:45,580
- You hurt bad?
- Only my pride.

52
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,269
I couldn't win against all of them.

53
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:51,107
Thank you, master, for what you done.

54
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:54,805
- How's Jesse?
- She gonna be fine.

55
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,375
Shouldn't have even been on our land.

56
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,636
You tell them next time. Easter.

57
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,576
They ain't never gonna pay no never mind
to a slave.

58
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:07,805
Why? I have to
if I want to stop you chattering... Oh, ow!

59
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:11,107
- sake.
- They'd whoop me or worse.

60
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:13,804
They sell me llom here
like they did my mammy.

61
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,106
That won't ever happen.
You won't ever be sold.

62
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,838
This is your home. It always will be.

63
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:23,409
Besides. whatever would I do
without you?

64
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:29,108
That all very line. master.
but I still don't get to go to no wedding.

65
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,502
What wedding?

66
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,374
Master James is taking the family...

67
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,377
...to Nashville next month, Parson Dick,
for a wedding.

68
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:40,447
Yes. sir. I know. sir.
And you're not going.

69
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,304
- Now, how would you know that?
- Everybody knows it, sir.

70
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:47,744
The president's slave, Alfred,
is marrying Miss Gracie.

71
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,437
Now. why is it
when anything happens in this country...

72
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,104
...all the slaves know all about it
eons before we do?

73
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:57,510
Jungle drums. perhaps. master?

74
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:02,543
Well. that's exactly light. Voodoo.
That's what it is. Sheer voodoo.

75
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,203
Whites and Negroes at the same wedding.

76
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,973
Disglaceiul. ma'am. I agree.

77
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:11,444
You see? Even the Negroes are against it.

78
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,280
- Lizzie. you look lovely.
- Tush.

79
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:18,437
Just thinking about these Negro nuptials
makes me glow.

80
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,809
- Poor Mama's in a terrible pother.
- Aren't you going?

81
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,571
Of course we're going.

82
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:27,273
If only to see Miss Sarah
make a fool of herself.

83
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:30,107
Gill? My shawl.

84
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,703
going.

85
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,746
- I don't know if I am.
- Such a pity.

86
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,847
I would have saved you a place
on my dance card.

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,241
- Fool girl.
- Sorry, miss.

88
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,175
That's the best French chiffon.

89
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,373
- Please don't do that.
- Well. she's just a clumsy...

90
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,513
We don't treat our slaves that way.

91
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,306
Why. I declare.

92
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,745
Ale you a Negro lover?
It's a wonder you ain't going to Nashville.

93
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,438
Our old friend, Alfred,
is getting married at last, Captain Jack.

94
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,273
Yes. sir. So I heal. sir.

95
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:09,642
Well. you should be going to Nashville
as Master James' valet.

96
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,972
But there's more.

97
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,137
Oh. I can't lead. sir.
Now. you know it ain't legal.

98
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,644
He can damn sure lead
as well as you and I can.

99
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,245
Very well. then.

100
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,779
The president writes that Alfred
would like you to be his best man.

101
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,879
And of course, you have my permission.

102
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,172
That's wonderful news, sir.

103
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,712
- Will you write to tell him I accept?
- I already have.

104
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,744
Thank you. Captain Jack.

105
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,643
What is it?

106
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,909
It's my daughter. Easter. sir.

107
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,880
You know. Annie's gill.

108
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,242
She wants to go to that wedding
more than anything. sir.

109
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,876
- It would mean the world to her.
- Well, of course.

110
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,842
She can tend the ladies.

111
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,002
- Is that all?
- Yes. sir.

112
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,669
Thank you very much. sir.

113
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,236
James. will you wait a moment?

114
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,839
I remember my own father.
God lest his deal soul...

115
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:11,743
...when he colored me with such a talk
before I left for the New World.

116
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,009
It's never easy to! me to discuss
personal matters with you. James.

117
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:20,148
But now. I must be even and direct.

118
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,643
It is time you were married.

119
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,874
- Yes. sir.
- Good then.

120
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:33,948
VVe've... That is, I've prepared a list
of eligible heiresses for your consideration.

121
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,376
Daughters of planters, all of them.

122
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:40,572
The Perkins gill is my first choice.
He! family's quite agreeable to it all.

123
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,907
And you seem quite taken
with her self as well.

124
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,235
Liz is...

125
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,313
Liz is charming. but she's...

126
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:57,448
- I don't know it I love her.
- Whele do you get these wretched ideas?

127
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,477
Love has nothing to do with it.

128
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,340
It's for <i>sons,</i> Jamie.

129
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,777
Heirs to inherit all that I've created here.

130
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:08,608
Love can come later, if you're fortunate.

131
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,411
You know.
the first time I saw your mother...

132
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:19,777
...I thought she was the most
beautiful creature I'd ever seen.

133
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,340
And I wanted he! at that very moment.

134
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,640
But I didn't love he! then
at that very moment.

135
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,145
I didn't know her.
I'd not even spoken to her.

136
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,076
Love came later with knowledge.

137
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,544
The more I came to know her.
the more I loved her...

138
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,113
...until now I cannot bear
to be apart from her.

139
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:42,111
But we were married
for different reasons.

140
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,042
We married for mutual benefit.

141
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,909
We married for family.
And it's high time you did the same, Jamie.

142
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:52,709
Now then. this Perkins gill
would bring a fine dowry.

143
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,938
And he! bleeding is gland as well.

144
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,174
So if there's no one else on the list,
I suggest you put your mind to it.

145
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,972
- No. sir.
- What?

146
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,275
No. sir.

147
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,577
- There's no one else.
- There's a good lad.

148
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,577
- Come along. we'll have a drink on it, then.
- Yes. sir.

149
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,680
Now. I don't...
Don't heal any hesitation on that score.

150
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,678
4300!
“Ah!

151
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,079
It is gonna be a wonderful wedding.

152
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,406
The talk of the South.

153
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:33,013
I certainly am looking forward to it.

154
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,540
Well. I hope you have a nice time. then. sir.
with that Miss Lizzie.

155
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,306
Don't be mean. Easter.
just because she slapped you.

156
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:44,812
- I told her off.
- And couldn't take your eye off her.

157
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:49,476
Well. Miss Lizzie's very charming.

158
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:52,170
I sure am looking forward
to seeing he! again.

159
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:54,276
And who you gonna dance with?

160
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,303
At the wedding.

161
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,346
Yes. you can go.
You can go as my sister's maid.

162
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,306
We wouldn't have missed ii, Sarah.

163
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,310
You know my husband,
Andrew Jackson, Jr.

164
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,708
It's my pleasure. sir.
Will your father come?

165
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:29,508
No, sadly, no. The affairs of state
keep him in Washington.

166
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,146
Our daughter. Elizabeth.

167
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,776
I ain't never seen such dresses.

168
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,844
Now. you simmer down. missy.

169

And you mind your manners.
There's important people here.

170
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,777
Well. this is quite a fuss
you've stirred up.

171
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,571
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Well. o1 course.

172
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,373
You know. we weren't sure
i1 anyone would come.

173
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,673
Sarah, my father's the president.
Now, who would turn you down?

174
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,369
- James.

175
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,171

177
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:59,475
You old buzzard, you.

178
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,241
This here is Gracie. Jack.

179
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,711
Oh my, ain't you the prettiest thing.

180
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,507
I don't understand.
Now. how did this old grizzly bear...

181
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,806
...catch something as lovely as you.

182
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:16,005
Now, speaking of pretty things.

183
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:19,705
Oh. this here be Easter.
Me and Annie's gill.

184
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:23,679
Well. little sweetheart, you just make sure

185
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,872
- Yes. sir.
- Oh. you done fine. Jack. Just fine.

186
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,702
Well. the hell with it.

187
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,777
We can't let the niggers
have all the fun. Sarah.

188
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,073
- Oh. my God.
- She touched him.

189
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,477
Sony. master.

190
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,306
Does anyone own this gill?

191
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:38,976
Come along. Easter.

192
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:42,006
I expect you have work to do.

193
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,114
Somebody should flog that bitch.

194
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,235
Where's the music?

195
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:57,174
What am I paying you iellas 101?

196
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:12,010
Hush. Easter. It was an accident.
No one's gonna blame you.

197
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,147
They all do.

198
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,405
There you are. James.

199
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:20,014
I have found a place for you
on my dance card.

200
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,243
Look after her, Captain Jack.

201
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,510
Child.

202
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,610
No strenuous activity of any kind.

203
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,007
Leave it all to your son.

204
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,179
He's quite capable.

205
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,170
How long might I have?

206
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,303
That's impossible to predict.

207
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,771
I'm sorry. James.

208
00:19:55,133 --> 00:20:00,845
Suddenly.
everything seems so very urgent.

209
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,009
Yes. master?

210
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:18,782
I want to thank you for the many years
you've been with me, Captain Jack.

211
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:21,345
No one could have served me better.

212
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,480
Thank you. master.

213
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,782
When you first came to me. you know.
I didn't hold with slavery in this land.

214
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,774
But it was the custom here.

215
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:39,350
So I promised you that IL you worked lo! me
willingly and well...

216
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,606
...I would give you your freedom one day.

217
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,637
Here is that freedom now.

218
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:49,141
- A little later than it should have been.
- No.

219
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,973
No, thank you, master.

220
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,841
Don't do this to me.

221
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:05,480
A long time ago.
when I wanted to many Annie...

222
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:10,013
...I asked you 1o! my freedom
and you told me no.

223
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,743
Wasn't time.

224
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,673
- But I needed you then.
- You bloke your promise to me.

225
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:22,642
And you let my Annie be sold away.

226
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:27,578
So, what good is freedom to me now?

227
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm old. What would I do?

228
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,704
Where would I go?

229
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,145
What's left of my life is here with Easter.

230
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,146
- But you can stay here. Flee.
- Yes. sir. I'll stay.

231
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,144
And I'll work for you
until the end of my days.

232
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,215
But every time you see me.
every time you look at me...

233
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:59,940
...you'll remember
what you did to my Annie.

234
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,637
And the promise that you bloke to me.

235
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,477
When I was a young man in Ireland...

236
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,442
...I fought against the British.

237
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:24,576
That was a cause I believed in
because they had enslaved us.

238
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:28,210
And I would have given my life
for that cause.

239
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:34,674
When I was a young man.
I didn't believe in slavery.

240
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,641
Then I came here...

241
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,204
...and I got rich.

242
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:45,780
And I forgot what I believed in.

243
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,841
I bloke my promise to a man...

244
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,905
...who was my most loyal friend.

245
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,671
What are you doing here. Easter?

246
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,677
Ain't no law against it.

247
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,211
There is because I say so. Now, clear off.

248
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:35,746
- Because you buck-naked?
- Don't you talk that way. Easter.

249
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,380
Bet you gonna
let Miss Perkins watch you.

250
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:41,104
Don't you talk that way
about Miss Perkins.

251
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:44,908
It's Miss Perkins this and Miss Perkins that
all the time these days.

252
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:47,638
What's become oi plain old Lizzie?

253
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,771
- You wouldn't understand, Easter.
- Oh, I understand, all right.

254
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:55,972
- You got the fever for Miss Lizzie.
- You hush up. That's vile talk.

255
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:59,979
Well, you can just cool off that fever
in the cold water a little more longer.

256
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:03,376
Hey. Easter.
You come back here with my clothes.

257
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:06,446
I'll whip your hide. I swear I will.

258
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,738
Come on and whoop me then.

259
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,344
Oh. come on. Easter.
this is beyond a joke.

260
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,709
Promise me you gonna come and see me
more often.

261
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:19,211
I'm not going to promise you.
You're a slave.

262
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:23,042
Get your tail out of here.
Do what I tell you.

263
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,472
Get dressed. young master.

264
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,243
There is God.

265
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,206
Yes. Father.

266
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:42,104
We all believe in God.

267
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:51,848
There is God in everyone.

268
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,639
It was my pleasure
to serve your daddy as overseer. sir.

269
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,212
And it would be my pleasure
to serve you.

270
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,142
Thank you. Henderson.

271
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,107
Our sincere condolences. sir.

272
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:35,714
- We are all at your disposal.
- Thank you.

273
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:23,346
I so sorry.

274
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,440
You have to make a decision
about Lizzie.

275
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,047
I mean. it's been months.
We can't have he! dangling like this.

276
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,043
I know. I know.

277
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,578
Of course if there's someone else...

278
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,044
- No, Lizzie's the one. I just...
- Well, then what are you waiting for?

279
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:31,636
- James?
- Love. I suppose.

280
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,509
Love can come later.
Duty must come first.

281
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:41,143
Look at that.

282
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,176
See that?

283
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,973
Mercy.

284
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,440
Some people say
it means the end of the world.

285
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,177
And some folk say it the star...

286
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,844
...that guide the Wise Men to Bethlehem.

287
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:06,011
I with child.

288
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,174
And you got nothing to say?

289
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,840
Say?

290
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,108
It's another damn mouth to feed.

291
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,377
They say it hurts, you know?

292
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,376
And you...

293
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,613
...never could stand a lick of pain.

294
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,704
We've known each other so long.

295
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:20,010
You must think I'm an awful slow coach.

296
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:26,148
always said
that we make a splendid couple.

297
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,244
So why don't we prove them light?

298
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,404
Will you many me?

299
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:44,209
Oh. James. I thought you'd never ask.

300
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:57,276
I'll try to be a good wife.
Give you fine sons.

301
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:14,209
Oh. it's a gill. Easter.

302
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:18,747
Yeah, you got yourself a fine baby girl.

303
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:32,013
What a wedding it'll be.

304
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:37,412
The South in all its glory.
and not a Negro invited.

305
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:40,106
Are you still smarting about that?

306
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,269
But it was a disgrace.

307
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,971
Blacks in such proximity
to white women.

308
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,704
We must be constantly on guard.

309
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:50,143
Nliscegenation will be the downfall
of the South.

310
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,679
Why. I've seen plantation children
you could swear were white.

311
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,177
We all have.

312
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:57,345
And in that cesspool New Orleans.

313
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,646
We ladies should retire.

314
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,308
Excuse me. master.

315
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,845
Slave-child just been born.

316
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,136
That's good news. Captain Jack.

317
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,407
Give the mother our congratulations.

318
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,478
Yes. ma'am. I surely will. ma'am.

319
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:20,206
And Easter's doing just fine.

320
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:24,978
Easter?

321
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,835
She does the weaving.

322
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,073
Suddenly I... I don't feel well.

323
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:41,443
The wine, heat.

324
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,479
Excuse me.

325
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:51,547
She gets sick headaches.

326
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:59,203
Lizzie. deal.

327
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:02,075
I won't many him.

328
00:33:02,434 --> 00:33:04,846
Yes. you will.

329
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,737
This is the richest union
that you could ever make.

330
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,503
You will have a long engagement.

331
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:16,672
And you will become used
to the idea and grateful for it.

332
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:19,280
Why, if it were not for the slave girls...

333
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,147
...we women would have to
submit to our husbands...

334
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,941
...whenever they feel healthy.

335
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,642
Papa too?

336
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,440
All men are the same. deal.

337
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:36,277
All lecherous brutes.

[SINGING “ALL THE PRETTY
LITTLE HOHSES"I

339
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,309
Little princess.

And white as cotton.

341
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:42,178
Her life will not be easy.

342
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,246
She looks as white as you or I.

343
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,643
Does she have a name?

344
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,838
Captain Jack calls he! Princess.

345
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,238
You men and the havoc you cause.

346
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,076
Princess.

347
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,669
Princess.

348
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,938
Princess.

349
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:21,038
Hello. Queen.

350
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,169
Was it bad?

351
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,104
Popped out easy.

352
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:50,405
Liar.

353
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:56,377
I could heal you
all the way at the big house.

354
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:06,848
While I was proposing to Lizzie.

355
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,143
It good you took a wife.

356
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,737
You need a son.

357
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,976
But I have the best of you.

358
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,010
Let me give you a flesh glass, ma'am.

359
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:12,413
Well. congratulations.
I thought you'd never get around to it.

360
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:16,242
Well. you know me. Sam.
I like to be sure.

361
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:19,271
This child is adorable. Who's is she?

362
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:22,569
Guess.

363
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:28,947
Oh. you rascal. you.

364
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,808
Did I tell you I'm gonna be lecturing
at Harvard next year?

365
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:35,244
I must say she is a lovely child.

366
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,435
She's a darling.

367
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,275
She'll make a splendid companion
to any daughters Lizzie might have.

368
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:41,777
Such a sensible arrangement.

369
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:44,642
Though it's taken Lizzie
a while to get used to the idea.

370
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,212
I don't know
what I'd do without our slave gills.

371
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,974
MI. Perkins is a regular demon.
you know?

372
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,036
Yes.

373
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:58,646
The place is looking splendid. James.
Your father would be proud.

374
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,006
I think we're doing well.

375
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:02,306
Salting some away
for a rainy day, I hope.

376
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:06,040
- There are some storm clouds out there.
- Hope nothing serious, surely.

377
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,806
These abolitionists are becoming
quite strident.

378
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,846
These new northern politicians
may take up their cause.

379
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,311
- The end of slavery wouldn't be the end.
- It'd be the end of the South.

380
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:17,242
- Without cheap labor...
- We'd divelsiiy.

381
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,641
I don't see you
getting out of cotton, James.

382
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,044
Well, here she is.
And looking so beautiful.

383
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,711
Thank you. Papa.

384
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:28,507
I need to steal my groom
for a minute, please.

385
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,078
Oh. James.

386
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,703
My. aren't you the pretty little thing.

387
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,403
Who's little gill are you?

388
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:43,112
Oh. I think you need a nap.
Come on. darling.

389
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:46,908
Come on. I know. I know.

390
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:50,313
- Why, she's just as white as cotton.
- Shh.

391
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:53,641
How was I supposed
to know she's Negro?

392
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,976
- This field nearly planted. Henderson?
- Yes. sir.

393
00:40:19,134 --> 00:40:22,206
Niggers are working hard today.
We should be done by this evening.

394
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:23,675
Very good.

395
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:27,043
Master says y'all
working pretty good today.

396
00:40:27,734 --> 00:40:30,908
But IL you like to eat.
you'll work a little harder.

397
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:33,547
You like them sweet potato things?

398
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,043
Move it!

399
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,508
You heal me?

400
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,503
- What's that one?
- Cat.

401
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,476
- Right.
- Stop that.

402
00:40:40,634 --> 00:40:43,672
Anybody find out you learning
her to read, we all get whooped.

403
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:46,144
- Or worse.
- Well, she got to learn, ain't she?

404
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:49,812
E is for “ephalump.“

405
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:54,512
No, child. That's elephant. Elephant.

406
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,273
- Elephant.
- Right.

407
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:59,243
What's elephant?

408
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,404
Well. see. an elephant is
a great big old animal...

409
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:06,071
...with a long. long nose.

410
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:07,645
He live in Africa.

411
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,974
That's where my rnarnrny and pappy came
from and all your family.

412
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:14,411
My <i>mammy</i> Cherokee.
I ain't never been to Ahica.

413
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:18,071
Well, Africa is a beautiful country.

414
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,475
A long, long way from here, though.

415
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,607
Is that where my pappy is?

416
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,736
You heal that?

417
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:29,603
No, child.

418
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:33,010
But your daddy
is a very important man.

419
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:37,240
So you got to learn good, work hard.
You know, make him proud of you.

420
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,008
Stop that. Queen.
don't you ever think about your pappy.

421
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,574
He don't matter to you.
You stop to put fancy ideas in her head.

422
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:46,940
Heading and stuff.

423
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,104
She a slave and always gonna be one.

424
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:53,680
Slaves gonna be flee one day.
Everybody talking about it.

425
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:56,946
- I tell you the day is coming...
- Us ain't going to be around.

426
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,637
Well. maybe and maybe not.

427
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,837
But Queen sure will be.

428
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,176
And when that better day come,
we got to be ready for it.

429
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,944
Ain't no use in having freedom
if you can't use it.

430
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,013
If you ain't got learning, you know,
to better ourselves.

431
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:16,979
All I do is dream
of that better day for her.

432
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:19,044
Well. you go on and dream.

433
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,907
But you let that child be.

434
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:27,746
That day will come. You'll see.

435
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:30,947
That day will come.

436
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:39,749
- She ain't white.
- I am too. Look at me. Look at me. I am...

437
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,973
<i>You're just {Ike us-
You're a nigger, just {Ike us.</i>

438
00:42:44,134 --> 00:42:47,513
- Look at me. Look at me.
- You ain't got no pappy.

439
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,442
I do too.

440
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,676
<i>- You ain't got no pappy.
- You ain't got no pappy.</i>

441
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:57,977
Go on! Go on! Get out of here.
Get out of here, you little brats.

442
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:03,374
There. there. there. don't cry.

443
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:06,912
- There's no need now.
- But they called me names.

444
00:43:08,234 --> 00:43:09,508
Well.

445
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,910
People called me names too
when I was little.

446
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,771
Why do they do that?

447
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:18,278
Because I different.

448
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:21,040
Because I look white.

449
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,644
Because I can lead.

450
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:36,609
Queen.

451
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,281
Don't ever tell anyone that you can lead.

452
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:42,845
Some people wouldn't like it.

453
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,104
- They might try to hurt you.
- But my pappy would've stopped them.

454
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:48,941
Like you stopped those.

455
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:51,638
Captain Jack.
take this child to the kitchen.

456
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,179
- Get he! a sweet.
- She been trouble. master?

457
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,104
No.

458
00:43:57,734 --> 00:43:59,839
No trouble at all.

459
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,606
Sarah Jane got some cookies
in that kitchen for you.

460
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,646
How about some ice-cold milk too?

461
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,773
What you look 101?

462
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,373
Nothing.

463
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,042
What are these?

464
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:35,407
Nothing.

465
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,070
What's that?

466
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,906
Nothing.

467
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:12,239
Mm. This soup is delicious.

468
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:16,038
Why is everyone so glum?

469
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,543
Politics.

470
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,704
Something women shouldn't bother
their pretty heads about.

471
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:24,610
- Don't be patronizing, dear.
- Of course it bothers us.

472
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:27,771
All that Yankee talk
about the abolition of slavery.

473
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,675
Whatever would we do?

474
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,245
And that dreadful business...

475
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,846
...with Nat Turner
killing white women and children.

476
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,741
We could all be murdered in our beds.

477
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,574
And my baby.

478
00:45:42,234 --> 00:45:43,269
What baby?

479
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,244
My baby.

480
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:52,211
Congratulations.

481
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:54,040
That's wonderful, Lizzie.

482
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,202
Of course I'm hoping for a boy.

483
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:58,404
A boy. gill. I don't care.

484
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:01,104
Just the thought of a baby.

485
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:02,678
Thank you. Lizzie.

486
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:06,508
You did have something
to do with it. James.

487
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:09,170
We'll have to fix the nursery.
And find a good Nanny.

488
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:11,780
And of course the child will need a slave.

489
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:13,777
What? There's plenty of time for that.

490
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:16,437
Well. there's no harm in looking.
We'll need the best.

491
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,071
Unless. well.
Queen could come and live here...

492
00:46:21,234 --> 00:46:22,770
...and be a companion for him.

493
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:25,847
Or her.
And they could grow up as friends.

494
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,104
- No.
- And she could...

495
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:28,507
...help out around the house.

496
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:33,140
Do you really think that's a wise idea?

497
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:36,242
I think it's an excellent idea, Mother.

498
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:39,640
Lizzie. I am so pleased.

499
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:44,347
When will it be?

500
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,073
No.

501
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:56,105
She'll be raised with my children.
She'll have all the advantages.

502
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:01,441
But she all I have.

503
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:04,211
She'll still be yours.

504
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:10,444
I want this, Easter. It's best for her.

505
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:29,015
Why does master come see you
every night? He my pappy?

506
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:31,169
You hush up about your pappy. Queen.

507
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:32,938
Before I take a switch to you.

508
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,547
He ain't here
and that's all there is about it.

509
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,704
You just know
that your <i>mammy</i> love you.

510
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,279
And your master will love you too.
just like he was your pappy.

511
00:47:54,534 --> 00:47:57,310
You should have used the back door.

512
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,002
You ma'! 9°-

513
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,977
I still going to see he! again, missy?

514
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:05,841
Of course you will.

515
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:09,444
This is another house.
not another county.

516
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:12,071
But you should know...

517
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:17,677
...this is the master's decision.
I do not approve oi it.

518
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:22,309
But since it is to be.
the child will be given every advantage.

519
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:26,244
She will be trained as a lady's maid
with all the necessary etiquette.

520
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,943
So when you see her...

521
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,170
...keep your distance.

522
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,642
I don't want he! learning
your Negro ways.

523
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,076
I only want the best for her, rnissy.

524
00:48:36,234 --> 00:48:39,215
What you want has nothing to do with it.

525
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:41,969
We own her.

526
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:47,277
Now. say goodbye and go.

527
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:58,348
You gonna be a fine lady. Queen.

528
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,416
You gonna live in a big old house
just like I always told you.

529
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,005
Now. you be good. You do as you told.
You heal me?

530
00:49:09,234 --> 00:49:10,269
Just like...

531
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,077
Just like you have a new mammy.

532
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,411
I am he! mistress.

533
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:17,569
Not he! mammy.

534
00:49:18,534 --> 00:49:20,070
Come along. Queen.

535
00:49:23,767 --> 00:49:25,747
I don't want to.

536
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:28,208
Queen.

537
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,307
Queen?
Aren't you ever gonna be ready?

538
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,175
- Queen?
- I sorry, Miss Jane. I coming.

539
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,971
What kept you so long?

540
00:50:16,134 --> 00:50:18,239
Couldn't make up my mind
which bonnet to weal.

541
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,938
Well. come on. Papa's going mad.

542
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,506
There you are at last.

543
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:29,547
Miss Jane. Miss Queen.
Young ladies do not run.

544
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,611
- Sony. Papa.
- You both look lovely.

545
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:34,771
Now, come on. The shops will be closed
before we get there.

546
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:09,340
All right, all you red-blooded,
God-fearing young men.

547
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,946
That's one opportunity for travel
and promotion.

548
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,307
Good pay.
You'll start at $11 per month.

549
00:51:14,467 --> 00:51:18,643
You'll make great companions.
You'll have the best of arms. You'll have...

550
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,246
You know. Uncle Sam is planning
to wage slaves...

551
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,505
...like all those people in northern...

552
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,973
One. One. One. two. one.

553
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:32,081
One. One. One. two. one.

554
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:35,078
- Is there gonna be a war, Papa?
- No. Of course not.

555
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:37,077
Why would Americans
want to fight Americans?

556
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:40,044
- Because of slavery?
- Speak when you're spoken to, Queen.

557
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,510
Looks like war. All those soldiers.

558
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,943
It's just a lot of
fuss and bother about nothing.

559
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:48,905
Jane, you can go window shopping,
but be careful.

560
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:52,640
- Don't talk to any strange men.
- Oh. everyone knows us here. Mama.

561
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,474
I know.
There are a lot of strangers in town.

562
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:57,169
Queen. keep he! company.

563
00:51:57,334 --> 00:51:59,905
- You have money for a cool drink?
- Yes, Mama.

564
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,113
- How dale they.
- I don't mind it.

565
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:19,181
- Afternoon, ladies. Sure is a pretty day.
- All around the square.

566
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:21,074
We don't speak to strange men.

567
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:25,272
- Oh, we're not strange. Just strangers.
- And we just wanna be your friends.

568
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,640
Pay no attention to them.

569
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,543
Oh. now. then. don't be so heartless.
We've come to enlist to! the war...

570
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,874
...and you just might be
the last pretty ladies we talk to in years.

571
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,103
We might even die.

572
00:52:36,434 --> 00:52:37,936
So how about it?

573
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,980
Come on. just one little bitty kiss
to! a soldier on his way to glory?

574
00:52:42,134 --> 00:52:43,943
Leave me alone.

575
00:52:46,267 --> 00:52:49,077
- That didn't hurt a bit. did it?
- How dale you kiss my slave?

576
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:51,771
I'm surprised at you.
I thought you were a gentleman.

577
00:52:51,934 --> 00:52:53,607
Come on. let's go.

578
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:56,641
How the hell was I supposed
to know? The bitch looks white.

579
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,112
Keep her off the streets.
Put a sign on her or something.

580
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:04,107
- Ale you all light. Queen?
- I was scaled.

581
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,269
They're just pool white trash.

582
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:11,540
I don't want no war.
And I hate them soldiers.

583
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:16,105
I must say, he's quite a catch.

584
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:20,771
Never thought I'd nab me
a real live overseer.

585
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,007
Some more tea, Mrs. Henderson?

586
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:29,139
Why, thank you. No, Miss Jackson.
I have had an elegant sufficiency.

587
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,749
I am so sorry. The time just slipped away.

588
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:35,505
Is this your bride?

589
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:39,308
Miss Palmer. It was, sir. Of Charleston.

590
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,209
Aren't you the sly one,
keeping your pretty wife a secret.

591
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:45,143
Well, it happened so fast, sir.
On my leave.

592
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,076
I took one look at him
and I said to myself...

593
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:50,578
I said. "Leticia. that is the man to! you.“

594
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:58,047
Young ladies do not listen at doors.
Upstairs at once. The pail oi you.

595
00:53:59,634 --> 00:54:02,444
And my dear
mother's heart is broken, of course...

596
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,671
...that I'm living so far away from home.

597
00:54:04,834 --> 00:54:10,682
And my poor father.
All this talk of war, and me getting wed.

598
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:14,179
His only comfort these days is the gin.

599
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:21,142
Isn't she awful? Why did he marry her?

600
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,804
- Don't wanna end up an old maid, I guess.
- He can't keep his eyes off her.

601
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:27,140
That's enough.

602
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:31,210
Men are so funny when they're in love.

603
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:34,246
Hany Peters says he loves me
all the time.

604
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,142
And he gets all sweaty
every time he says it.

605
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,770
But he wants to be a preacher.
and I don't think that would be fun.

606
00:54:40,934 --> 00:54:46,407
- I wanna many a prince on a white horse.
- Oh. Queen. don't be silly.

607
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:50,538
You're just a raggedy itty-bitty slave girl.
Who's gonna marry you?

608
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,772
Somebody will. One day.

609
00:54:56,434 --> 00:55:00,246
Now I lay me down to sleep.
Play the Lord my soul to keep.

610
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,279
And please.
don't let Hany become a preacher.

611
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:06,972
- And send a nice slave 1o! Queen.
- Amen.

612
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:10,172
- Good night, Queen.
- Good night, Miss Jane.

613
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:16,975
I suppose it wouldn't be too bad
being a preacher's wife.

614
00:55:17,134 --> 00:55:20,741
But I'd lather he was something dashing.

615
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,146
Another game?

616
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:55,672
I'm going to bed.

617
00:55:58,334 --> 00:55:59,972
Ale you coming up?

618
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:03,273
In a little while.
I might get some ail.

619
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:08,074
- Don't be too long.
- No, of course.

620
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:10,235
Sleep well, my love.

621
00:56:13,934 --> 00:56:16,574
Is there gonna be a war. James?

622
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,472
Oh. maybe. But I doubt it.

623
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:24,509
It's probably just hot ail.
You know how these things are.

624
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:27,876
The politicians will hull and pull
until the last moment...

625
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:31,743
...and then everyone will back down
and find a sensible solution.

626
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,574
Play God you're light.

627
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,778
It frightens me so.

628
00:57:06,334 --> 00:57:08,336
Such a pretty night.

629
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,843
What's wrong?

630
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,339
Abraham Lincoln
has been declared president-elect.

631
00:57:22,867 --> 00:57:25,313
Southern states are up in arms about it.

632
00:57:26,367 --> 00:57:30,110
Mississippi's already talking about
seceding 110m the Union.

633
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,039
So is South Carolina.

634
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,610
There's gonna be a war. Easter.

635
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,176
Because of slavery?

636
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,371
Yes.

637
00:57:53,534 --> 00:57:56,378
Oh, they'll say it's for the South.

638
00:57:56,534 --> 00:57:57,774
States' lights.

639
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,605
Can't have a bunch of Yankees
in Washington...

640
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:03,373
...telling us how to run our affairs.

641
00:58:03,934 --> 00:58:05,936
You gonna fight?

642
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:07,836
Yes.

643
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,871
For slavery?

644
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,203
- No.
- Well. what then?

645
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:20,815
For the land.

646
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:26,179
For honor.
For everything my father worked for.

647
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:30,941
To hold onto what's ours.

648
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,137
To keep us safe.

649
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,977
I promise you. I'll come home.

650
00:58:56,634 --> 00:58:59,444
<i>Bu! H anything does happen to me...</i>

651
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,749
...know that I will have loved you
until the moment that I died.

652
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,279
Have we been good to you?

653
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,111
Yes. missus.

654
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:20,441
- You've been very good to me.
- I've tried.

655
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:25,346
- I hope you're happy.
- Yes. ma'am.

656
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,673
You'd say that even if you weren't.

657
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,872
You're such a pretty child.

658
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,805
You remind rne of those portraits
that I've seen of the Empress Josephine.

659
00:59:39,233 --> 00:59:40,735
Ma'am?

660
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:45,015
She was this lovely French girl
from the island of Martinique.

661
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:50,446
She came to Paris and captured the heart
of the emperor, Napoleon.

662
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,707
And their court was the grandest
of all Europe.

663
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,404
And they had a vision of a great empire.

664
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:02,072
That was my husband's dream.

665
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:07,243
To conquer the wilderness.
To make a new society.

666
01:00:10,134 --> 01:00:15,482
And here we are at war with one another.
Brothel pitched against brothel.

667
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:20,515
And all that work undone.

668
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:42,743
Mammy, he dressed up like a soldier
going for war.

669
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,243
I don't want him to die.

670
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,540
There, there now, Queen.
He come home safe.

671
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,646
You can't know that.

672
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,110
I ain't never tell you no lie.

673
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:56,071
Not even about my pappy?

674
01:00:57,933 --> 01:01:00,413
You always told me that he left us
and went away.

675
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:04,879
But the other slaves laugh at me.
Talk about me behind my back.

676
01:01:05,134 --> 01:01:08,581
They tell me that the master...

677
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,103
<i>...m'{ PaPPY-</i>

678
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:13,745
Is he?

679
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:16,739
Is that true?

680
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,772
Don't listen to them. Queen.
It don't matter.

681
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:24,914
It does matter.

682
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:28,844
It matters to me.
It like half of me missing.

683
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,615
I love you. Mammy. The black me.

684
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:37,805
But who the other side of me?
The white me?

685
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:40,140
Where she came from?

686
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,837
From love. child.

687
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,342
I swear before God, from love.

688
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,478
- Daddy. no.
- It's all light, Jane.

689
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,143
Jane. it's all light. I'll be home soon.

690
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:23,675
I hate to see you go.

691
01:02:24,467 --> 01:02:25,946
I hate to have to go.

692
01:02:27,434 --> 01:02:30,745
Be brave. Do your duty.

693
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:44,937
I can't bear it.

694
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:48,609
I love you.

695
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:54,403
Don't go, please.

696
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,909
I must.

697
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:58,410
No. please. God.

698
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,373
No. please. God.

699
01:03:04,534 --> 01:03:07,242
- Go. master. quick.
- Oh. God.

700
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,539
Take care of them, Queen.

701
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:30,315
Forward. ho.

702
01:03:45,134 --> 01:03:47,842
Pray for him, Queen.

703
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,207
<i>He YOU! PaPPY~</i>

704
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,245
Some of you will have heard...

705
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,179
...that this war is being fought
for and against slavery.

706
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:22,447
That is not true.

707
01:04:22,634 --> 01:04:25,774
The South is fighting...

708
01:04:25,933 --> 01:04:30,973
...for the right to protect
its own way of life.

709
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:36,940
The alternative
is too dreadful to imagine.

710
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:43,546
Now, you've all heard the stories
of what happens to your people up north.

711
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,271
Hunger. sickness. poverty.

712
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:50,108
This is not our way.

713
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,840
When you are sick. we tend you.

714
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,269
When you are hungry, we feed you.

715
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,945
When you are old, we care for you.

716
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:07,012
And when you die. we bury you.

717
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,510
That is our Christian duty.

718
01:05:13,267 --> 01:05:18,512
And now I ask that you all kneel
and play with me.

719
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:37,309
Oh. Heavenly Father.
our creator and provider.

720
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:44,579
We pray to you now in this,
our hour of need.

721
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:50,773
We beg for peace, oh, Lord,
and an end to this war.

722
01:05:50,934 --> 01:05:52,675
File!

723
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,577
<i>And we beg
that in your infinite wisdom...</i>

724
01:05:56,934 --> 01:06:01,576
<i>...yuu spare lives
that would needlessly be lost in battle.</i>

725
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:06,007
<i>And we humbly ask that in your mercy...</i>

726
01:06:07,334 --> 01:06:11,441
<i>...you bless and protect our beloved son,
James.</i>

727
01:06:12,967 --> 01:06:14,742
<i>Keep him safe from harm...</i>

728
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:20,350
<i>...and bring him home again
to the bosom of his family.</i>

729
01:06:20,767 --> 01:06:24,010
<i>But if his time on earth is done...</i>

730
01:06:25,734 --> 01:06:31,150
...we beseech you to receive him
in paradise...

731
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:36,505
...and attend him with angels.

732
01:06:37,434 --> 01:06:39,209
Amen.

733
01:06:58,134 --> 01:07:00,375
Get some hot water. Hurry.

734
01:07:00,534 --> 01:07:03,378
Lieutenani. they're coming in.
it's more than we can handle.

735
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:05,013
We set up another tent there.

736
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:06,202
- Yes. sir.
- Get to it.

737
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,869
Yes. sir.

738
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,475
Hang on. son.

739
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,478
I need some...

740
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,177
He's gone.

741
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:29,910
Hold him down. Hold him down.

742
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:32,343
Gonna get you another man.

743
01:07:33,067 --> 01:07:36,412
- I'm scaled.
- Don't be. son. It's easy.

744
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,344
Be mindful of God's mercy.

745
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,413
What“? What mercy?

746
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,343
Hold him down.

747
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,906
- All right, bring those three in.
- Hang on, son, hang on.

748
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,770
My buddy!

749
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:02,475
I need a table. I need a table.

750
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:06,739
Cover him up.

751
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:14,645
- All light, son.
- How is it, James?

752
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,539
Bloody dreadful.

753
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:23,480
- How is it?
- Same. It's gonna hurt, like it or not.

754
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:28,509
Tell me.

755
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:31,113
Tell me true. cousin.

756
01:08:31,267 --> 01:08:32,974
Am <i>I</i> dying?

757
01:08:33,134 --> 01:08:34,807
Well. James. you'll live.

758
01:08:34,967 --> 01:08:37,743
We're working our guts out
to keep you with us.

759
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,573
Did we win?

760
01:08:43,734 --> 01:08:45,839
Oh. yeah. we won.

761
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:48,680
Bull Run is ours. cousin.

762
01:08:48,867 --> 01:08:52,280
Then God be thanked.

763
01:08:52,434 --> 01:08:55,745
I wouldn't have wanted to die
for nothing.

764
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:01,269
We need a hand here.

765
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:21,208
She's slipping away. I know it.

766
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:24,473
Do something. Get the doctor.

767
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:28,680
Can't do nothing. Miss Lizzie.
It's the diphtheria.

768
01:09:28,834 --> 01:09:30,677
You heal what he say?

769
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,609
Oh. Lord. Jane.

770
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,443
Let me do that. Let me help you.

771
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,103
You think I'd leave he! here with you?

772
01:09:41,267 --> 01:09:45,147
You don't care about Jane.
All you care about is your brat. Queen.

773
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:50,443
Haven't you had enough from me?
You want my child dead too?

774
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:55,605
I'll have you whipped.
I'll have you sold away.

775
01:09:56,334 --> 01:09:59,281
- Get the overseer.
- There ain't no overseer.

776
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:05,043
It's just us womens now.
We gotta help each other.

777
01:10:11,034 --> 01:10:13,571
I'm sorry.

778
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:18,843
I'm so sorry. Easter. I didn't mean it.

779
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:23,143
I didn't mean it.

780
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:28,004
There now. Miss Lizzie.

781
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:31,141
Ain't no harm done.

782
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,106
It's just your pain talking.

783
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:39,507
That look real good there.
Parson Dick. How your back doing?

784
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:42,546
It ain't doing so good.
Quit bothering me.

785
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,704
I know you ain't used to being
out here and ain't happy about it.

786
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:49,280
But we're gonna be all light.
I get you some water. all light?

787
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:51,072
- And what y'all laughing at?
- Queen?

788
01:10:51,234 --> 01:10:54,147
If y'all was working,
Parson Dick wouldn't have to be out here.

789
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,474
Miss Sally, what you doing out here?
This ain't no place for you.

790
01:10:57,634 --> 01:11:01,013
A letter from the master.
I can't read it. My eyes.

791
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:02,407
But Miss Lizzie can lead.

792
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:04,706
You think I want he! to know
my business? Here.

793
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:07,177
- I can't do it.
- I know you can.

794
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:08,870
It against the law.

795
01:11:09,034 --> 01:11:11,480
What does it matter now?
Who's gonna whip you now?

796
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:15,582
- Here, read it. Head it.
- All right, Miss Sally.

797
01:11:20,467 --> 01:11:23,505
“My dearest Mother...

798
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:27,911
...I hope this letter finds you well.“

799
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:31,537
The master's been wounded.
He's coming home.

800
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:35,239
He's been discharged.
He's coming home.

801
01:11:37,967 --> 01:11:39,742
Be a pool homecoming.

802
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,313
- What is wrong with you?
- I's fine.

803
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:49,572
Just making some broth for Miss Lizzie.

804
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:53,045
No, you're not fine.
I'm gonna help you.

805
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:12,247
What you gonna do?
Go out in the field like some Negro slave?

806
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:15,908
You're too old. Miss Sally.

807
01:12:16,134 --> 01:12:17,772
You're just too plum old...

808
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:22,713
...to bleak your back picking cotton.
husking com.

809
01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:28,077
None of us would be here
if it wasn't for you.

810
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:31,174
Now it's your time to lest.

811
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,214
I used to be pretty good
at picking cotton.

812
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:42,138
We used to put our hands
to all sorts of things.

813
01:12:42,301 --> 01:12:44,679
Back in the early days.

814
01:12:57,034 --> 01:12:59,446
Oh. Lord. my back.

815
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:02,582
Ain't fitting.
the mistress planting cotton.

816
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:04,111
I can't do it anymore.

817
01:13:04,267 --> 01:13:05,575
- We have to.
- I can't.

818
01:13:05,734 --> 01:13:09,477
We gotta get this field done by sunset.
Come on.

819
01:13:09,634 --> 01:13:11,409
What is this?

820
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:15,447
Miss Jackson. what are you doing
out in the field planting cotton?

821
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,012
Queen needed me.

822
01:13:18,067 --> 01:13:20,308
So Queen is in charge now?

823
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:25,678
Queen can order the mistress of the house
out into the field like some common nigger?

824
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:29,543
Somebody had to, Miss Henderson.
There ain't enough of us niggers left.

825
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:33,774
Don't you sass me. gill.
Don't you ever sass me.

826
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:37,006
Or you will regret it
till the end of your days.

827
01:13:37,434 --> 01:13:39,539
I do need a rest, Queen.

828
01:13:39,701 --> 01:13:44,411
You come with me. Miss Jackson.
Come on. There's some water over here.

829
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,480
Oh. play God. Let it be.

830
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,145
James.

831
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,371
<i>Oh. God.</i>

832
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:03,014
Miss Lizzie. we ain't done yet.

833
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,272
It's Master James.

834
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,978
Oh. my love. Oh. James.

835
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:13,080
My love.

836
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,374
I'm sorry. ma'am. I haven't seen him.

837
01:14:33,234 --> 01:14:35,840
There was a horrible epidemic.

838
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:38,345
There was nothing we could do.

839
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:40,605
Nothing.

840
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,680
- Deal God.
- No.

841
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,947
Now. don't you argue with me.
You're going to bed.

842
01:14:53,101 --> 01:14:55,581
I be fine. missy.

843
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:03,237
Hun and fetch Queen now.
Hun as fast as you can.

844
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:13,279
Mammy! Mammy!

845
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:42,845
Come now.
we have to find a winding-sheet.

846
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,174
Come. child.

847
01:16:02,467 --> 01:16:04,572
My love.

848
01:16:14,467 --> 01:16:17,073
Sony I ain't come yesterday. Mammy.

849
01:16:17,234 --> 01:16:19,510
But I had a lot to do.

850
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:23,447
Hope you didn't miss me too bad.

851
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,445
Things ain't too good around here.
Mammy.

852
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,678
Half the slaves gone up north.

853
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,941
Some of them said they gonna fight.

854
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:41,809
I do the cooking now,
and the cleaning for Parson Dick.

855
01:16:42,434 --> 01:16:45,506
And Miss Sally. she too old.

856
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:49,046
And Miss Lizzie. always sick.

857
01:16:49,734 --> 01:16:52,476
Captain Jack. he ain't light in his head.

858
01:16:52,634 --> 01:16:56,673
Keep saying freedom gonna come
for all of us.

859
01:16:56,834 --> 01:17:00,281
Like he always knew it would.

860
01:17:00,434 --> 01:17:02,573
Say we can all leave here.

861
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,374
Go soon.

862
01:17:06,967 --> 01:17:10,039
But I don't know
where I gonna go. Mammy.

863
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,471
This here my home.

864
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,740
These are here my family.

865
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,743
I miss you.

866
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:32,975
I sorry. master.

867
01:17:35,467 --> 01:17:37,538
It's all light, Queen.

868
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:43,708
I come see he! most every day
when I can.

869
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:49,147
I've been watching you, Queen.

870
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,111
You work hard.

871
01:17:55,234 --> 01:17:58,113
I'm sorry we're not more help to you.

872
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,674
Ain't your place. master.

873
01:18:05,467 --> 01:18:07,606
Sometimes I wonder where my place is.

874
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,476
Don't hate yourself so much, master. I...

875
01:18:13,734 --> 01:18:15,907
We love you.

876
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,908
I'm going back.

877
01:18:23,534 --> 01:18:26,811
I'm going to form a regiment of my own.
I'm going back to fight.

878
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:29,413
No, master.

879
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,472
Would you mind, Queen.
lo! a little while?

880
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:09,402
It's not light, James.

881
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,672
- You fought. You were wounded.
- That's enough.

882
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:14,781
- What it the Yankees come?
- They'll never get this far south.

883
01:19:14,934 --> 01:19:16,538
They might.

884
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,509
And it's my job to try and stop them.

885
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:23,912
- Sergeant. lead them out.
- Forward. ho!

886
01:20:40,867 --> 01:20:42,608
Yes.

887
01:20:44,901 --> 01:20:47,074
Hallelujah.

888
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:49,571
Yes.

889
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,274
- The Yankees.
- What?

890
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:00,004
The Yankees coming.

891
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:03,273
The Yankees coming.
They done burned up Florence.

892
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:06,415
- Old Lincoln. and they killing everybody.
- Praise be!

893
01:21:20,767 --> 01:21:23,043
Good morning. captain.

894
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:27,147
We are, as you can see,
a depleted family.

895
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:31,841
There are no men folk here,
apart from these few slaves.

896
01:21:33,334 --> 01:21:36,213
I trust you mean no harm to us.

897
01:21:36,467 --> 01:21:40,438
We mean no harm to anyone. ma'am.
who is loyal to the Union.

898
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:44,181
I cannot swear allegiance to your flag. sir.

899
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,680
I believe in a different cause.

900
01:21:46,834 --> 01:21:48,745
Well. you believe in any cause you like.

901
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,573
As long as you do not try to fight us.

902
01:21:51,734 --> 01:21:53,611
I don't think that you would win.

903
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:57,214
We are your prisoners
and we'll do as we are bid.

904
01:21:57,367 --> 01:21:58,744
We're taking no prisoners.

905
01:21:58,901 --> 01:22:01,541
You're free to go
about your peaceful business.

906
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:03,942
However. there are some other things.

907
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,135
My men are hungry.

908
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:06,844
We have very little.

909
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:10,175
You will be given a voucher
to the value of what we take.

910
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:14,507
And as your local militia destroyed
the bridge to delay our advance...

911
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:18,274
...we have orders to seize cotton
to pay for its repairs.

912
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,602
That is our only income.

913
01:22:20,767 --> 01:22:22,644
It's of no value to you now.

914
01:22:22,801 --> 01:22:26,010
This area's under federal jurisdiction.

915
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:29,114
Your local cotton mills will be destroyed.

916
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,738
You will not harm us.
but you will bankrupt us?

917
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,479
I have my orders. ma'am.

918
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:43,083
Sir, you will kindly arrange
an escort for me.

919
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:44,269
Ma'am?

920
01:22:44,434 --> 01:22:47,779
If you are going to destroy
our only means of livelihood...

921
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:50,005
...I intend to be there to watch.

922
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:54,673
It would be an honor for me, rna'arrl,
to escort you myself.

923
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:03,141
Steady the horses.

924
01:23:07,434 --> 01:23:09,505
Whoa. whoa!

925
01:23:12,067 --> 01:23:14,570
Steady. Hold steady.

926
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,472
How would you have us live now?

927
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:35,608
I lost two brothels in this war.

928
01:23:35,767 --> 01:23:38,111
Killed by Johnny Heb.

929
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:42,071
I don't care how you live.

930
01:23:42,867 --> 01:23:45,006
Or if you live.

931
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:57,911
All right, gentlemen, let's hurry it up.

932
01:23:58,567 --> 01:24:00,569
- Easy.
- Help me.

933
01:24:01,934 --> 01:24:04,039
- Leave us something.
- The lady wants us...

934
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,304
...to leave he! something.

935
01:24:05,467 --> 01:24:08,038
I'll leave he! something.
I always wanted a line Southern lady.

936
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:10,545
- Leave me.
- You going with the slaves. little gill?

937
01:24:10,701 --> 01:24:12,476
- Leave me alone!
- Ever try a real man?

938
01:24:12,634 --> 01:24:13,840
She wants to play.

939
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,241
I know a game she can play.

940
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:19,147
Don't tell them. Don't you ever tell them.

941
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:23,148
- Your black slave come to protect you?
- Come on, old man.

942
01:24:23,301 --> 01:24:25,577
- Get inside!
- What are you gonna do about it?

943
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,302
Get down. sir.

944
01:24:34,134 --> 01:24:36,171
- Stay down. old man.
- No! No!

945
01:24:38,834 --> 01:24:41,405
No! No!

946
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,573
Ne!

947
01:24:45,834 --> 01:24:47,836
Captain Jack. no!

948
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,844
Leave him alone!
Leave him be! Leave him be!

949
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,147
- Her turn now?
- No, she's just white trash.

950
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,574
Leave he! alone.

951
01:24:55,734 --> 01:24:56,940
Captain Jack.

952
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:04,277
Come on. please.

953
01:25:12,934 --> 01:25:15,574
As far as help hem me.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

954
01:25:18,034 --> 01:25:19,945
Can't you keep out of trouble, cousin?

955
01:25:24,034 --> 01:25:26,344
I don't think I can save that arm.

956
01:25:29,567 --> 01:25:31,945
I'll be discharged again.

957
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:34,171
Not this time. James.

958
01:25:35,467 --> 01:25:38,846
Colonel's don't need two good arms.
But we do need every man we can get.

959
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:11,382
He say he dying.
I can't talk him out of it.

960
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:15,712
Captain Jack?

961
01:26:18,867 --> 01:26:20,744
Captain Jack.

962
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:28,844
The Lord is calling me. Mrs. Sally.

963
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:31,845
I'm sure he would wait a while.

964
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,210
No, Lord, it's been my time.

965
01:26:38,267 --> 01:26:40,873
But I wanna die flee.

966
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:42,775
But you are flee.

967
01:26:43,301 --> 01:26:46,180
And you have been for a long time.

968
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,541
I have your paper here.

969
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,441
Yeah.

970
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,080
Master gave it to me years ago.

971
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,838
He said one day
that you'd be asking for it.

972
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,813
Now. you stop all this talk
about dying. you heal?

973
01:27:11,201 --> 01:27:15,308
We've been together for a long time.

974
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,412
I mean. we have done some things.

975
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:22,443
Now. didn't we?

976
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,574
You knew old Master James before I did.

977
01:27:29,034 --> 01:27:32,208
You remember how we set him up?

978
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:38,616
I told you where he went riding
and you was there...

979
01:27:38,767 --> 01:27:42,305
...nursing your baby
by you first late husband.

980
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:46,142
Showed much more of myself
than I should.

981
01:27:46,367 --> 01:27:50,406
One look at you and he was gone.

982
01:27:51,301 --> 01:27:54,510
Oh. we've had some times“ Yes...

983
01:27:55,034 --> 01:27:57,310
Oh. Oh.

984
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:08,139

985
01:28:13,567 --> 01:28:18,573
This here be Annie's grandchild.

986
01:28:19,434 --> 01:28:23,177
Don't ever let her be sold
away from here.

987
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,573
Please.

988
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,606
Oh. I couldn't do that.

989
01:28:32,767 --> 01:28:35,475
Soon she'll be flee.

990
01:28:36,034 --> 01:28:38,344
All the slaves will be flee.

991
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,303
All the slaves be flee?

992

Oh. sweet Jesus.

994
01:28:52,534 --> 01:28:54,707
Then this must be...

995
01:28:57,934 --> 01:29:01,472
Then this must be that better day.

996
01:29:32,001 --> 01:29:34,003

01:29:34,467 --> 01:29:39,644
Well. maybe now

999
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,980
I'm leaving. I'm going to Virginia to see
ii I can find my brothels and my sisters.

1000
01:29:48,134 --> 01:29:50,512
Then maybe on up north.

1001
01:29:50,801 --> 01:29:54,339
- But this here where you belong.
- No.

1002
01:29:54,734 --> 01:29:56,714
No, Queen.

1003
01:29:56,867 --> 01:29:58,710
Not anymore.

1005
01:30:03,267 --> 01:30:05,338
I don't belong to no man.
and neither do you.

1006
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:11,911
If I was you, I'd get as far away
from this plantation as I could.

1007
01:30:13,934 --> 01:30:15,811
But these here my family.

01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,607
What you expect your pappy to do?

01:30:21,267 --> 01:30:23,338
Take you into the bosom
of his family...

1011
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:27,004
...tell the whole world that
“this little Negro girl here is my daughter“?

1012
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:28,202

01:30:32,867 --> 01:30:35,040
White folks gonna stick together

...and quadloons. an octoloons running

01:30:42,134 --> 01:30:45,581
And as for you,
you don't mean nothing to them.

1018
01:30:45,734 --> 01:30:48,476
They won't even admit that you exist.

1019
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:52,507
Ain't true.

1020
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:53,941
Ain't true.

1021
01:30:56,934 --> 01:30:58,880
They love me.

01:31:32,467 --> 01:31:34,344
We have no place for you here.

1031
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:38,072
But this my home.

1032
01:31:38,234 --> 01:31:41,272
Listen to me very carefully.

1033
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,976
The world as we knew it has gone.

1034
01:31:45,134 --> 01:31:47,114
And it can only get worse.

1035
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:51,478
We cannot feed the family even now.

1036
01:31:52,434 --> 01:31:56,507
And after the war,
I don't know what we'll do.

1037
01:31:57,467 --> 01:31:59,447
Well. I'll help you.

1038
01:32:00,567 --> 01:32:04,640
I'll cook. I'll clean.
I'll tend the garden. I'll do everything.

1039
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,441
We love you
and we have tried to do light by you.

1040
01:32:08,601 --> 01:32:11,741
But you are a Negro
and you are a slave.

1041
01:32:12,234 --> 01:32:16,705
And times will be hard and your best place
will be with your own people.

1042
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,775
My pappy won't let you tum me away.

1043
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:26,282
You rnust never think
of Colonel James as your father.

1044
01:32:26,934 --> 01:32:28,845
You're a child of the plantation.

1045
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:32,013
Just like a thousand others.

1046
01:32:32,901 --> 01:32:34,608
That's all.

1047
01:32:37,867 --> 01:32:39,847
You my people.

1048
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,802
This my family.

1049
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,904
Miss Sally.

1050
01:32:48,067 --> 01:32:49,910
Miss Sally.

1051
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,376
You're my family.

1052
01:33:14,734 --> 01:33:16,577
Mammy.

1053
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:22,204
Help me. Mammy.

1054
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,306
God. help me.

1055
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:28,538
What I gonna do?

1056
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,839
Where I gonna go?

1057
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,911
Help me.

1058
01:33:33,467 --> 01:33:34,673
Help me.

1059
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,106
Help me.

1060
01:37:40,367 --> 01:37:42,369
Any man who wants to sell his land...

1061
01:37:42,534 --> 01:37:44,707
...I'll give him a fair price for it.

1062
01:37:44,867 --> 01:37:47,905
Cash money. No questions asked.

1063
01:37:48,067 --> 01:37:49,307
Yankee dollars.

1064
01:37:51,767 --> 01:37:54,338
You could buy half the South
for a decent meal.

1065
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,240
I'll have no work for you, you know,
when we get back.

1066
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,902
With no slaves.

1067
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:03,610
We got a bit put by.

1068
01:38:03,767 --> 01:38:07,715
The missus has always wanted a stole.
Some small thing.

1069
01:38:14,934 --> 01:38:16,038
Made you some coffee.

1070
01:38:17,401 --> 01:38:22,316
It ain't very good.
Just ground up acorns.

1071
01:38:22,467 --> 01:38:23,912
But it's hot.

1072
01:38:25,434 --> 01:38:27,311
What y'all want for dinner?

1073
01:38:30,134 --> 01:38:32,774
I was wondering what we might have
to! dinner tonight.

1074
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:35,169
- Hmm?
- Chicken.

1075
01:38:35,334 --> 01:38:39,578
- Mm. Mm. Mm.
- I'd love some roasted chicken with gravy.

1076
01:38:39,734 --> 01:38:44,183
Well. Miss Lizzie. you go out
and catch me a chicken and I'll cook it.

1077
01:38:45,067 --> 01:38:46,842
I could make a vegetable stew.

1078
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:53,010
I suppose we'll have to do
with vegetable stew again.

1079
01:38:53,901 --> 01:38:55,107
Mm.

1080
01:38:56,034 --> 01:38:59,208
Mm. We must count our blessings.

1081
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,303
I'm sure it'll be delicious.

1082
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,241
Blessed alt thou among women...

1083
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:35,904
...and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1084
01:39:36,067 --> 01:39:37,842
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

1085
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,674
...pray for us sinners,
now and the hour of our death...

1086
01:39:40,834 --> 01:39:43,007
He coming! The master coming!

1087
01:39:43,167 --> 01:39:45,477
- Oh. no.
- Jesus.

1088
01:39:45,634 --> 01:39:47,978
No. Oh.

1089
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:52,036
Isaac.

1090
01:39:53,334 --> 01:39:55,041
Davie. you still here?

1091
01:39:55,201 --> 01:39:57,807
Matter of fact, master,
we was just leaving now.

1092
01:40:01,601 --> 01:40:04,445
Well. I could use some help
around this place.

1093
01:40:05,767 --> 01:40:07,212
Won't be able to pay you much.

1094
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,438
But something.

1095
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,102
That's kind of you, master.

1096
01:40:11,267 --> 01:40:14,976
But Davie, here, wanna see the world.
He ain't never been off the plantation.

1097
01:40:17,434 --> 01:40:18,845
Well...

1098
01:40:20,267 --> 01:40:22,247
...if you change your mind...

1099
01:40:24,333 --> 01:40:26,210
Good luck to you.

1100
01:40:46,634 --> 01:40:49,808
Mama, I'm sorry.

1101
01:40:52,034 --> 01:40:54,605
I'm so very sorry.

1102
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,677
My beloved son.

1103
01:41:00,867 --> 01:41:06,010
You're home. You're home.

1104
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:25,811
Come on. Isaac. let's get.

1105
01:41:31,701 --> 01:41:34,375
You come along with us. Miss Queen.
Ain't nothing 1o! you here.

1106
01:41:38,267 --> 01:41:41,111
Well, you take care of yourself now,
you hear?

1107
01:41:41,267 --> 01:41:43,110
Come on. Isaac.

1108
01:41:43,767 --> 01:41:46,441
We moving so slow
we ain't never gonna get there.

1109
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,473
We'd be happy to.

1110
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:13,140
I got a poor price for it.
Needs must be met.

1111
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:18,681
Before long, I'll have no land left to sell.

1112
01:42:22,034 --> 01:42:24,275
I can't go on like this.

1113
01:42:27,567 --> 01:42:29,604
You're very quiet.

1114
01:42:31,367 --> 01:42:34,837
But then I suppose I haven't said
a lot of things I should.

1115
01:42:36,134 --> 01:42:39,638
Like thank you,
for all you've done for us.

1116
01:42:40,634 --> 01:42:44,309
I should have
said something before. But...

1117
01:42:45,634 --> 01:42:47,614
Well. I...

1118
01:42:48,101 --> 01:42:51,742
I'm very grateful. We all are.

1119
01:42:52,034 --> 01:42:54,537
- Ain't nothing.
- Yes. it is.

1120
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:58,739
You've been housekeeper, gardener.
cook and maid all rolled into one.

1121
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,972
I don't think my family could have survived
without you.

1122
01:43:03,301 --> 01:43:06,748
I can't afford to pay you much.
A few dollars a week.

1123
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:10,313
- But when things get better...
- I don't want your money.

1124
01:43:11,101 --> 01:43:14,571
I have to pay you something.
illegal now.

1125
01:43:19,534 --> 01:43:22,640
Doing lather better than we are.
aren't they?

1126
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:25,576
Good day. Henderson.

1127
01:43:25,834 --> 01:43:28,041
If it's about more credit...

1128
01:43:28,201 --> 01:43:31,273
No, I've come to pay my bill.

1129
01:43:31,434 --> 01:43:34,608
Well now. that is good news.

1130
01:43:34,767 --> 01:43:36,610
The missus will take care of you.

1131
01:43:36,767 --> 01:43:40,078
Leticia. MI. Jackson's here. Financial.

1132
01:43:40,234 --> 01:43:42,771
Oh. MI. Jackson. come on in.

1133
01:43:42,934 --> 01:43:45,881
I've got some fine roasting hens.

1134
01:43:46,034 --> 01:43:49,572
That uppity little girl's
still with you. I see.

1135
01:43:49,734 --> 01:43:52,180
Nice day for it, lady.

1136
01:43:52,334 --> 01:43:54,678
Don't mess with her.
She's a high yellow.

1137
01:43:54,834 --> 01:43:56,973
Well. hell. it don't matter to me.

1138
01:43:57,134 --> 01:43:59,546
I don't mind a little midnight velvet.

1139
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,709
How was your day. mother?

1140
01:44:11,134 --> 01:44:14,604
Well, I went to the Mitchell funeral.

1141
01:44:14,767 --> 01:44:18,840
It was quite a turnout considering
what a vile-tempered man he was in life.

1142
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:23,674
You spend your life going to funerals.

1143
01:44:24,867 --> 01:44:28,314
Mm. getting used to it, I suppose.

1144
01:44:28,467 --> 01:44:31,038
Well. doesn't this look delicious?

1145
01:44:31,567 --> 01:44:33,308
You'd think it was a celebration.

1146
01:44:34,234 --> 01:44:37,044
I suppose it is in a way.

1147
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,771
I don't know how pleased you'll be...

1148
01:44:40,934 --> 01:44:44,939
...given our circumstances,
we hardly need another mouth to feed.

1149
01:44:46,601 --> 01:44:48,205
A child?

1150
01:44:48,834 --> 01:44:50,279
That's wonderful, Lizzie.

1151
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:52,545
I'm praying for a boy.

1152
01:44:53,734 --> 01:44:54,940
I hope it's a gill.

1153
01:44:56,234 --> 01:44:58,475
With Jane gone.
the house seems so empty.

1154
01:44:58,934 --> 01:45:00,936
I need a little daughter to love.

1155
01:45:28,101 --> 01:45:30,240
- Hey. hey.
- All light, give it here.

1156
01:45:54,967 --> 01:45:56,810
There you go.

1157
01:45:56,967 --> 01:46:00,176
Sure don't look like two pound
to me.

1158
01:46:00,334 --> 01:46:02,177
You've lost none of your cheek,
I see.

1159
01:46:02,501 --> 01:46:04,174
Get in your place. gill.

1160
01:46:04,334 --> 01:46:07,838
You're nothing but an ex-slave
and hired help.

1161
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:10,345
And I suppose you want this on credit?

1162
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,208
The master could afford.
You get your money.

1163
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:14,812
Your prices high enough.

1164
01:46:17,634 --> 01:46:20,205
Ale you sassing me. gill?

1165
01:46:20,367 --> 01:46:22,870
You're accusing me of overcharging you.

1166
01:46:23,734 --> 01:46:26,340
L1 the high-and-mighty MI. Jackson
has any complaints...

1167
01:46:26,501 --> 01:46:28,481
...you tell him
to come and see me himself.

1168
01:46:28,634 --> 01:46:31,012
Not to send some bastard slave gill.

1169
01:46:31,167 --> 01:46:32,475
I ain't a slave no more.

1170
01:46:32,634 --> 01:46:33,977
You're a useless nigger...

1171
01:46:34,134 --> 01:46:37,513
...with no civil tongue in your head
for decent white folk.

1172
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:39,874
Hell. in the old days.
she'd have been whipped.

1173
01:46:40,034 --> 01:46:42,844
Uh-huh.
- Yeah, that's what she need now.

1174
01:46:43,001 --> 01:46:44,844
A good spanking to put he!
in he! place.

1175
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,537
- You can't touch me.
- Come here. gill.

1176
01:46:53,634 --> 01:46:55,375
Hey, come on.
Get ahold of her!

1177
01:46:59,834 --> 01:47:01,643
Whoa. Whoa. whoa.

1178
01:47:03,367 --> 01:47:06,348
- Come back here. whole!
- Come on. let's go!

1179
01:47:09,767 --> 01:47:11,678
Come on.

1180
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:10,105
- You see her?
- She can't be too far. Come on.

1181
01:48:36,434 --> 01:48:38,971
Ale you gonna sit out here all night?

1182
01:48:40,101 --> 01:48:43,105
- Something must have happened to her.
- Oh. we would have heard.

1183
01:48:43,267 --> 01:48:45,178
would have sent
a message.

1184
01:48:46,234 --> 01:48:49,113
- She's gone.
- Don't say that.

1185
01:48:49,767 --> 01:48:51,940
She's gone. James.

1186
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:54,443
Like all the other Negroes.

1187
01:48:57,434 --> 01:48:59,243
And I'm glad.

1188
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:03,603
I don't mean any harm.

1189
01:49:04,134 --> 01:49:06,444
I hope she hasn't been hurt...

1190
01:49:08,101 --> 01:49:11,082
...but I hope I never
have to look at he! again.

1191
01:49:12,167 --> 01:49:14,579
Because every time I do...

1192
01:49:15,034 --> 01:49:19,107
...it reminds me that you loved another
woman more than me.

1193
01:50:06,201 --> 01:50:08,010
Where have you been?

1194
01:50:09,067 --> 01:50:11,138
- I had some trouble. missy.
- Hmm.

1195
01:50:11,301 --> 01:50:14,510
Not half as much trouble
as you've caused around here.

1196
01:50:14,667 --> 01:50:16,772
No thought for us,
just off and away.

1197
01:50:18,067 --> 01:50:20,240
I had to cook dinner last night.

1198
01:50:20,467 --> 01:50:22,344
And clean up in my condition.

1199
01:50:24,167 --> 01:50:26,647
In the old days,
we'd have sent the dogs after you.

1200
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,009
Now, get yourself cleaned up
and get to work.

1201
01:50:31,934 --> 01:50:33,709
I sorry.

1202
01:50:33,867 --> 01:50:37,508
Your master's been looking for you
since daybreak, worried sick about you.

1203
01:50:37,667 --> 01:50:40,546
He ain't my master. He my pappy.

1204
01:50:40,701 --> 01:50:43,238
How dale you speak to me like that?

1205
01:50:44,268 --> 01:50:47,977
And how dale you speak to me like that?
You treat an old dog better than me.

1206
01:50:48,134 --> 01:50:50,614
Queen. do this. Queen. do that.
Cook. wash. clean...

1207
01:50:50,767 --> 01:50:53,577
...garden, plant cotton, pick cotton
frorn morning till night.

1208
01:50:53,734 --> 01:50:56,977
Not even a word of thanks.
Or even a mention I exist.

1209
01:50:57,134 --> 01:50:59,842
Well, I do exist, rnissy.

1210
01:51:00,001 --> 01:51:03,210
And I got a right to a little bit of love.

1211
01:51:03,934 --> 01:51:05,811
And if I can't find it here...

1212
01:51:05,967 --> 01:51:08,004
...I going to get it somewhere else.

1213
01:51:08,167 --> 01:51:09,202
So ungrateful.

1214
01:51:09,834 --> 01:51:11,677
After everything we've done for you.

1215
01:51:11,834 --> 01:51:14,246
You ain't never done nothing 1o! me.

1216
01:51:14,634 --> 01:51:17,080
And you won't ever have to now.

1217
01:51:23,134 --> 01:51:25,637
I gonna miss you, Mammy.

1218
01:51:27,034 --> 01:51:29,844
Because you the only friend I got.

1219
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:36,438
Weren't you even gonna come
to say goodbye to me?

1220
01:51:37,267 --> 01:51:39,213
I'm sorry.

1221
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,677
I tried to warn you.

1222
01:51:44,167 --> 01:51:46,408
You could have helped, Miss Sally.

1223
01:51:46,567 --> 01:51:48,979
You could have made things
a little easier.

1224
01:51:49,501 --> 01:51:51,879
Oh. perhaps.

1225
01:51:52,834 --> 01:51:55,007
But it would have been the same
in the end.

1226
01:51:55,401 --> 01:51:59,543
Why? Because I Negro?
I nearly white.

1227
01:51:59,701 --> 01:52:02,307
Only got a little bit of Negro blood in me.

1228
01:52:04,267 --> 01:52:07,009
It's not enough to be nearly white.

1229
01:52:07,467 --> 01:52:11,347
Even one little drop of black blood
is too much.

1230
01:52:14,167 --> 01:52:15,339
Here. take this.

1231
01:52:16,367 --> 01:52:19,041
- Take it.
- I don't want it.

1232
01:52:20,534 --> 01:52:23,708
You always were a stubborn child.

1233
01:52:25,601 --> 01:52:29,708
We owe you this much at least. Here.
Now. you take it.

1234
01:52:30,867 --> 01:52:32,312
Take it.

1235
01:52:36,301 --> 01:52:37,803
Yeah.

1236
01:52:42,301 --> 01:52:44,872
I don't suppose that. uh...

1237
01:52:45,867 --> 01:52:48,211
...I'll ever see you again.

1238
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:52,706
Good luck to you.

1239
01:52:55,234 --> 01:52:56,838
Wherever.

1240
01:52:57,734 --> 01:52:58,872
Whatever.

1241
01:53:02,001 --> 01:53:03,344
I'll miss you.

1242
01:53:08,334 --> 01:53:10,336
Oh. missus.

1243
01:53:42,434 --> 01:53:45,779
Queen. where have you been?
I've been looking all over.

1244
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,705
I leaving. For good.

1245
01:53:49,734 --> 01:53:53,011
Why? What happened?

1246
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:55,977
A lot of things happened.

1247
01:54:01,034 --> 01:54:02,638
Ale you sure you wanna go?

1248
01:54:10,734 --> 01:54:13,647
Well. at least let me give you a ride
into town.

1249
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,145
I can manage.

1250
01:54:20,067 --> 01:54:21,842
I'll miss you. Queen.

1251
01:54:24,367 --> 01:54:26,404
I gonna miss you too.

1252
01:54:30,967 --> 01:54:33,971
Write to us. Let us...

1253
01:54:35,334 --> 01:54:36,711
Let us know where you are.

1254
01:54:49,168 --> 01:54:50,203
Queen.

1255
01:54:54,734 --> 01:54:56,270
Remember...

1256
01:55:00,534 --> 01:55:03,014
...there is God in everyone.

1257
01:56:43,167 --> 01:56:45,613
Hurry up now.
We're going to be late.

1258
01:56:51,534 --> 01:56:54,276
Coach for Charleston leaving soon.

1259
01:56:56,034 --> 01:56:57,308
Charleston. please.

1260
01:56:57,467 --> 01:56:59,378
Yes. ma'am. Return?

1261
01:56:59,534 --> 01:57:02,606
No. I not coming back.

1262
01:57:02,767 --> 01:57:03,939
Take your bag. ma'am?

1263
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:07,547
You stupid dalky.
My luggage goes on first.

1264
01:57:08,534 --> 01:57:10,207
Yes. ma'am.

1265
01:57:12,634 --> 01:57:15,672
You can't trust these darkies
to do anything right.

1266
01:57:15,834 --> 01:57:17,609
Have to keep your eye on them
every moment.

1267
01:57:18,667 --> 01:57:21,409
And you shouldn't be here
by yourself, dear.

1268
01:57:21,567 --> 01:57:23,308
Not a pretty, young thing like you.

1269
01:57:23,467 --> 01:57:26,641
Why these darkies would have us away
as soon as look at us.

1270
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,336
You take my meaning?

1271
01:57:29,767 --> 01:57:32,509
Such a pretty, young thing.

1272
01:57:32,667 --> 01:57:33,805
Where you from?

1273
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:38,613
Meeting my ma...
Mama in Charleston.

1274
01:57:38,767 --> 01:57:42,078
She been visiting in Martinique.
She comes from there.

1275
01:57:42,234 --> 01:57:48,014
You're French. Oh. the islands.
So romantic.

1276
01:57:48,167 --> 01:57:52,115
And you have the coloring.
Such lovely dark eyes.

1277
01:57:52,534 --> 01:57:54,707
But you shouldn't be traveling
on your own.

1278
01:57:55,467 --> 01:57:57,913
Oh, my papa said I gonna be fine
on the coach.

1279
01:57:58,067 --> 01:58:00,206
And the kintolk gonna meet me
when I get there.

1280
01:58:00,367 --> 01:58:03,576
Oh, it's such a relief
to find pleasant company.

1281
01:58:03,734 --> 01:58:05,975
There's so much
trash traveling nowadays.

1282
01:58:06,134 --> 01:58:09,980
I've been in fear of my life
all the way from Natchez.

1283
01:58:10,134 --> 01:58:12,171
You probably haven't heard
of my pappy then.

1284
01:58:12,334 --> 01:58:14,940
Colonel Jackson, Forks of Cypress.

1285
01:58:15,101 --> 01:58:17,843
Oh. our glorious veterans.

1286
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,241
Such difficult times.

1287
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:23,404
You must tell me all about yourself
on the long journey.

1288
01:58:23,567 --> 01:58:28,141
Such a relief, someone to talk to.
We girls must stick together.

1289
01:58:28,834 --> 01:58:31,508
Now. let's go find our places.

1290
01:58:35,667 --> 01:58:38,876
Queen. youse a white gill now.

1291
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:01,504
I'm sorry I don't have
any references, rna'arrl.

1292
01:59:01,667 --> 01:59:05,444
- They was stolen.
- Well. it's <i>o1</i> no consequence.

1293
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:08,740
It really isn't a suitable job
to! a white gill.

1294
01:59:08,901 --> 01:59:12,041
Oh. I used to it. I been cooking
and cleaning...

1295
01:59:12,201 --> 01:59:13,441
...and I need the money.

1296
01:59:13,601 --> 01:59:16,411
Maybe you do.
But you don't fool me, rnissy.

1297
01:59:16,567 --> 01:59:20,105
Not for one moment.
You're black trash trying to pass...

1298
01:59:20,267 --> 01:59:23,043
...and we don't take kindly
to that sort of thing here.

1299
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,202
Now, get out of here
and to your own kind.

1300
01:59:25,367 --> 01:59:26,402
Next.

1301
01:59:39,267 --> 01:59:42,441
Fresh baked goods. Muffins.

1302
01:59:43,568 --> 01:59:46,048
Muffins. Fresh baked goods.

1303
01:59:52,401 --> 01:59:53,937
Scalawag.

1304
01:59:54,101 --> 01:59:56,638
Come back here. Come back!

1305
02:00:03,434 --> 02:00:05,812
- Ma'am.
- Sony.

1306
02:01:05,067 --> 02:01:08,571
You ain't got no place here. nigger.

1307
02:01:08,734 --> 02:01:10,645
Master. please. I'm white.

1308
02:01:10,801 --> 02:01:16,012
Come on, girl. You can't fool me.
This is for decent white folk.

1309
02:01:16,167 --> 02:01:20,445
Please. master. I so hungry.
I ain't ate in days.

1310
02:01:27,101 --> 02:01:30,344
- Haven't seen you here before.
- No, rna'arrl.

1311
02:01:30,501 --> 02:01:33,971
- Just got into town.
- Then you need feeding up.

1312
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:24,580
Tough. isn't it? Looking white.

1313
02:02:25,668 --> 02:02:29,980
- Ma'am. I swear...
- That's all light. I understand. sisiel.

1314
02:02:30,134 --> 02:02:32,444
High yellow. they call it.

1315
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:35,078
Dirty white would be better.

1316
02:02:35,867 --> 02:02:38,643
- You iunning me?
- Now. what do you think?

1317
02:02:38,801 --> 02:02:42,681
L'rn gonna sit in a roorn full of white folk
and tell you I was colored when I ain't?

1318
02:02:42,834 --> 02:02:44,973
You see what they do?

1319
02:02:46,501 --> 02:02:49,175
We're lucky we can choose.

1320
02:02:49,334 --> 02:02:51,814
Who would choose to be black?

1321
02:02:51,967 --> 02:02:54,038
Black is hard.

1322
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,577
White is so much easier.

1323
02:03:04,567 --> 02:03:06,308
It's beautiful.

1324
02:03:06,467 --> 02:03:09,812
- You rich?
- No.

1325
02:03:09,967 --> 02:03:12,743
I have some admirers.

1326
02:03:14,534 --> 02:03:16,605
Is you a whole?

1327
02:03:17,701 --> 02:03:21,308
If you wanna pass as white,
you have to watch your speech.

1328
02:03:21,467 --> 02:03:24,107
Nothing gives you away faster
than slave talk.

1329
02:03:24,501 --> 02:03:26,708
Never say “is you.“ Say “are you.“

1330
02:03:26,867 --> 02:03:28,847
I don't wanna pass for white. I is white.

1331
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,879
I don't wanna pass for black neither,
because that me too.

1332
02:03:32,034 --> 02:03:34,173
Little Miss In-Between, that's me.

1333
02:03:34,334 --> 02:03:37,008
Nowhere to go, no place for home.

1334
02:03:38,001 --> 02:03:39,605
I just a mistake.

1335
02:03:42,867 --> 02:03:46,337
You ain't no mistake. child.

1336
02:03:47,168 --> 02:03:51,241
But you do smell. You smell bad.

1337
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:59,279
Ale you a. you know. what I said?

1338
02:03:59,434 --> 02:04:01,710
A whole?

1339
02:04:02,801 --> 02:04:04,644
I don't think so.

1340
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:07,440
My rnarnrny worked for them,
took care of them.

1341
02:04:07,601 --> 02:04:12,107
But she was always on at me.
“Alice." she'd say...

1342
02:04:12,267 --> 02:04:17,114
...“you take care of what you got, girl.
It's all a girl is got.“

1343
02:04:17,267 --> 02:04:19,543
She let it get wore out.

1344
02:04:20,401 --> 02:04:22,472
Then the Yankees came in the war.

1345
02:04:23,301 --> 02:04:25,872
They raped me
and they burned down the house.

1346
02:04:26,034 --> 02:04:28,105
So I came here.

1347
02:04:28,334 --> 02:04:29,779
I sorry.

1348
02:04:29,934 --> 02:04:33,245
Oh. child. It's done.

1349
02:04:33,601 --> 02:04:35,877
But I swore...

1350
02:04:36,467 --> 02:04:39,471
...if white men wanted me so bad...

1351
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:44,047
...they were gonna have to pay for it.

1352
02:04:46,034 --> 02:04:48,412
I could never do that.

1353
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:52,071
And I ain't pretty like you.

1354
02:04:55,001 --> 02:04:59,177
What did they do to you
back in that big old mansion?

1355
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:07,281
Didn't anyone ever say
nice things to you?

1356
02:05:08,734 --> 02:05:13,205
Didn't anyone ever tell you
how pretty you are?

1357
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,607
Only my mammy.

1358
02:05:20,867 --> 02:05:25,873
Well. you see. child.
your <i>mammy</i> was light.

1359
02:05:26,767 --> 02:05:29,043
Mammys always are.

1360
02:05:33,867 --> 02:05:35,540
I don't dance too good.

1361
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:39,238
Oh, it's easy. Just follow the music.

1362
02:05:50,267 --> 02:05:53,214
Alice. my deal.
you're looking lovely as usual.

1363
02:05:53,367 --> 02:05:55,210
- Thank you.
- May I have the honor?

1364
02:05:55,367 --> 02:05:58,371
Why. George. I'd be delighted.

1365
02:05:58,534 --> 02:06:01,105
You're on your own.
Don't be a wall flower.

1366
02:06:01,267 --> 02:06:03,543
Don't leave me. Alice.

1367
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:29,871
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1368
02:06:32,434 --> 02:06:33,640
How do. pretty?

1369
02:06:34,034 --> 02:06:35,638
Shall we?

1370
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:38,972
Well. I'd be delighted.

1371
02:07:08,101 --> 02:07:10,741
I ain't never had such a time. Alice.

1372
02:07:10,901 --> 02:07:13,142
You must have danced
with every man in the loom.

1373
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:17,715
Well. I had to. That first one, Morgan.
kept trying to kiss on me.

1374
02:07:17,867 --> 02:07:21,246
- Ale all men like that?
- Most ol them.

1375
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:22,811
What'd you think <i>o1</i> George?

1376
02:07:23,234 --> 02:07:27,148
Well. he's so old. Alice.

1377
02:07:28,534 --> 02:07:33,142
Well, I think of him like he's my pappy.
And very rich.

1378
02:07:33,367 --> 02:07:37,338
Well, you ain't nothing but a whore
for all your fancy talk.

1379
02:07:37,934 --> 02:07:42,178
How I survive is my business, Queen.
Don't call me names.

1380
02:07:42,334 --> 02:07:45,804
- Well. it bothers me.
- Well. that's a pity.

1381
02:07:45,967 --> 02:07:50,780
Because George is a very nice man.
And he has a job for you if you want it.

1382
02:07:51,434 --> 02:07:53,675
I won't do that sort of work.

1383
02:07:54,867 --> 02:07:57,609
In a flower shop.

1384
02:08:21,301 --> 02:08:23,542
Is there anything I can do for you
today, sir?

1385
02:08:25,467 --> 02:08:28,880
A lose.
A single. very lovely. led lose.

1386
02:08:30,267 --> 02:08:33,441
What is it 101?
A wedding? Something special?

1387
02:08:34,701 --> 02:08:36,203
No.

1388
02:08:37,101 --> 02:08:39,206
This one's for you.

1389
02:08:53,334 --> 02:08:56,907
From the first moment I saw you.
surrounded by loses...

1390
02:08:57,067 --> 02:08:59,513
...I haven't been able
to get you out of my mind.

1391
02:09:00,267 --> 02:09:02,247
I trust you do not think
me iolwald. ma'am.

1392
02:09:02,401 --> 02:09:04,881
- I know we've not been introduced.
- Why, no, sir.

1393
02:09:05,034 --> 02:09:06,240
I was most pleased...

1394
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:09,609
...when you asked me
to walk out with you this evening.

1395
02:09:09,767 --> 02:09:12,304
Ordinarily, I would, of course,
have asked your father.

1396
02:09:12,467 --> 02:09:15,414
But I do not know who he is
or how to find out.

1397
02:09:15,567 --> 02:09:17,274
You're not from these parts.

1398
02:09:17,434 --> 02:09:21,246
No. My home is far away.

1399
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,175
And your family?

1400
02:09:23,334 --> 02:09:24,972
A very old family, sir.

1401
02:09:25,134 --> 02:09:29,583
My father was a colonel in the war.
He lost an arm. You fought in the war?

1402
02:09:29,734 --> 02:09:33,307
It was my duty.
And my strong and passionate cause.

1403
02:09:33,467 --> 02:09:36,641
- Your father is Colonel...?
- My, a lemonade stand.

1404
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:38,643
I declare. I'm dying of thirst.

1405
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:42,612
Oh. I cannot have you die. my deal.
I've waited so long to find you.

1406
02:09:42,767 --> 02:09:45,213
Lemonade it is.

1407
02:09:45,767 --> 02:09:47,838
Your family is from Georgia, perhaps?

1408
02:09:48,834 --> 02:09:52,714
No. Um. Alabama.

1409
02:09:52,867 --> 02:09:54,813
Thank you.

1410
02:09:54,968 --> 02:09:58,245
You be careful, sooner or later
he's gonna have to know the truth.

1411
02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:59,936
Oh, don't spoil it for me, Alice.

1412
02:10:00,101 --> 02:10:02,240
It's the most beautiful thing
ever happened.

1413
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,710
And when he wants to know
more about you?

1414
02:10:04,867 --> 02:10:08,076
He already does.
He want to meet my family.

1415
02:10:08,234 --> 02:10:10,214
Oh. Queen. I could spank you.

1416
02:10:10,367 --> 02:10:13,940
Digby's obviously from an old family.
What you think he's gonna feel...

1417
02:10:14,101 --> 02:10:16,672
...when he finds he's been
stepping out with a Negro?

1418
02:10:16,834 --> 02:10:19,610
He ain't gonna know.
sick...

1419
02:10:19,767 --> 02:10:22,714
Every moment you're with him.
you're living a lie.

1420
02:10:22,867 --> 02:10:26,314
- One day you gonna slip.
- Oh, he cares for me, Alice.

1421
02:10:26,467 --> 02:10:28,242
But he makes rne feel wonderful.

1422
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:32,542
For the first time in my life, I feel
like somebody really cares for me.

1423
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:35,840
Then let him care for you.
Let him look after you.

1424
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,207
But don't let him be love.

1425
02:10:38,367 --> 02:10:40,313
Love is dangerous for women like us.

1426
02:10:40,467 --> 02:10:42,811
I'm not like you.

1427
02:10:49,067 --> 02:10:52,310
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1428
02:11:07,934 --> 02:11:09,436
Wow.

1429
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:11,008
Isn't it wonderful?

1430
02:11:12,434 --> 02:11:14,573
Those of us who fought
for the confederation...

1431
02:11:14,734 --> 02:11:16,111
...don't find much joy in it.

1432
02:11:17,234 --> 02:11:19,271
But it's the Fourth of July.

1433
02:11:20,867 --> 02:11:22,938
I wonder if your father's celebrating...

1434
02:11:24,134 --> 02:11:26,205
...in Florence.

1435
02:11:27,134 --> 02:11:28,841
I know all about you.

1436
02:11:30,167 --> 02:11:31,669
How?

1437
02:11:31,834 --> 02:11:35,213
There aren't too many Jacksons
in Alabama.

1438
02:11:36,401 --> 02:11:40,508
I know his mansion is called
the Folks oi Cypress.

1439
02:11:40,667 --> 02:11:44,342
And that it has gone to wrack and ruin
since the war.

1440
02:11:44,901 --> 02:11:46,676
Is that why you didn't tell me?

1441
02:11:52,268 --> 02:11:54,748
You silly goose.

1442
02:11:55,201 --> 02:11:57,010
We're none of us what we were.

1443
02:11:57,867 --> 02:12:00,245
I've watched my family's fortune fade
to nothing...

1444
02:12:00,401 --> 02:12:02,938
...but useless confederate
promissory notes.

1445
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,344
We are all pool now.

1446
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,707
We offended God when we lost the war.

1447
02:12:09,301 --> 02:12:13,181
And he is visiting
a terrible judgment on us.

1448
02:12:15,134 --> 02:12:18,707
Here we are. two lost and lonely people
who found each other.

1449
02:12:25,601 --> 02:12:27,842
I have no light to ask you.

1450
02:12:28,001 --> 02:12:30,675
I don't have a lot to offer...

1451
02:12:30,834 --> 02:12:32,313
mother than my love.

1452
02:12:33,467 --> 02:12:35,811
And. uh. I know I should
ask your father first...

1453
02:12:35,967 --> 02:12:39,437
...but I think he will understand.

1454
02:12:42,101 --> 02:12:43,637
Will you many me?

1455
02:13:09,101 --> 02:13:10,546
Look after the horses, sir?

1456
02:13:10,867 --> 02:13:12,210
We don't need your help.

1457
02:13:14,767 --> 02:13:17,839
Please, sir, just a few pennies.

1458
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:22,076
You heard the gentleman.

1459
02:13:22,234 --> 02:13:25,010
Let go of that! Let go.

1460
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:30,171
Don't you whup me.
I ain't no slave no more.

1461
02:13:30,334 --> 02:13:32,211
Don't you whup me!

1462
02:13:32,634 --> 02:13:35,774
- HeY. you filthy nigger!
- Aah! Aah!

1463
02:13:39,368 --> 02:13:42,611
He don't whup me. Nobody whup me.

1464
02:13:47,701 --> 02:13:49,772
Come along. my deal.

1465
02:13:58,134 --> 02:13:59,841
How could you be such a fool?

1466
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,502
- I had to.
- But I warned you.

1467
02:14:01,667 --> 02:14:04,648
I told you it was dangerous.
You can't many him.

1468
02:14:04,801 --> 02:14:06,144
He ain't never gonna know.

1469
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:09,213
Listen. It's not just you.
It's all of us who can pass.

1470
02:14:09,367 --> 02:14:11,540
So you many him.
but what is he gonna say...

1471
02:14:11,701 --> 02:14:14,341
...when you have babies
and a little pickaninny pops out?

1472
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:17,071
One day he's gonna know
you tricked him. lied to him.

1473
02:14:17,234 --> 02:14:19,236
Then it's not just you, it's all of us.

1474
02:14:19,401 --> 02:14:21,711
You get out of this, girl,
as fast as you can.

1475
02:14:21,867 --> 02:14:23,847
You been playing with file too long.

1476
02:14:24,001 --> 02:14:27,346
- I don't know how.
- Well, you think of something.

1477
02:14:27,567 --> 02:14:29,604
Peanuis. ma'am?

1478
02:14:31,967 --> 02:14:33,708
Ma'am.

1479
02:14:48,301 --> 02:14:52,443
Queen! What a wonderful surprise.
Please, come in.

1480
02:14:55,701 --> 02:14:57,612
I had to see you.

1481
02:14:57,767 --> 02:15:01,943
I wasn't expecting company.
Certainly not you.

1482
02:15:02,534 --> 02:15:04,741
Is something wrong?

1483
02:15:05,634 --> 02:15:07,614
You're not going back
on your wold. I hope?

1484
02:15:08,667 --> 02:15:11,409
Because I'd sue you
for breach of promise, you know.

1485
02:15:11,568 --> 02:15:13,775
I love you that much.

1486
02:15:14,301 --> 02:15:17,373
- Well. what is it? What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

1487
02:15:17,534 --> 02:15:20,344
Just a little close in here.

1488
02:15:20,501 --> 02:15:22,708
I'll open a window.

1489
02:15:30,467 --> 02:15:31,946
Now, what'd you wanna tell me?

1490
02:15:32,901 --> 02:15:34,312
Uh...

1491
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:37,009
Nothing.

1492
02:15:37,734 --> 02:15:41,477
- really. I just. uh...
- Well then. let me tell you something first.

1493
02:15:41,634 --> 02:15:46,344
It might make things easier to! you.
I wrote to your father today.

1494
02:15:48,367 --> 02:15:52,213
Queen! Honey. what's the matter?

1495
02:16:17,834 --> 02:16:19,575
You awake?

1496
02:16:20,668 --> 02:16:23,911
- How long have I been here?
- Oh. just a little while.

1497
02:16:24,068 --> 02:16:26,309
I went to the pharmacy.

1498
02:16:27,634 --> 02:16:30,080
- What is it?
- Laudanum.

1499
02:16:30,234 --> 02:16:34,046
I never used it before the war,
but now when the pain comes...

1500
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:35,843
I don't want opium.

1501
02:16:36,934 --> 02:16:38,504
It's very mild.

1502
02:16:38,967 --> 02:16:41,243
It'll make you feel better.

1503
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:46,774
There.

1504
02:16:48,801 --> 02:16:50,337
Now. just relax.

1505
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,272
Though you really shouldn't be
alone in here with me. you know?

1506
02:16:57,034 --> 02:16:59,605
But I won't tell anyone if you won't.

1507
02:17:01,634 --> 02:17:04,342
And we are to be married. aren't we?

1508
02:17:08,267 --> 02:17:10,213
I can't remember
when I've been so happy.

1509
02:17:10,367 --> 02:17:13,280
Don't say that.
You don't know anything about me.

1510
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,944
- Not really.
- Shh. shh. shh.

1511
02:17:16,101 --> 02:17:17,842
Let the drug do its work.

1512
02:17:19,501 --> 02:17:22,141
It'll make you feel so good.

1513
02:17:25,167 --> 02:17:29,274
Just like floating
on a fluffy pink cloud.

1514
02:17:38,467 --> 02:17:40,845
You're like a drug to me.

1515
02:17:41,834 --> 02:17:46,442
I only have to look at you
and all the pain is gone.

1516
02:17:49,834 --> 02:17:51,108
Mm.

1517
02:17:53,934 --> 02:17:55,504
Oh.

1518
02:17:56,201 --> 02:18:01,150
My love. I want you so much.

1519
02:18:01,301 --> 02:18:04,077
I need you so much.

1520
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:11,379
I've wanted you
from the first moment I saw you.

1521
02:18:13,334 --> 02:18:17,009
I can't wait until we're married.

1522
02:18:18,467 --> 02:18:20,140
I've got to have you now.

1523
02:18:20,867 --> 02:18:22,938
- It's been so long since I had a woman.
- No.

1524
02:18:23,101 --> 02:18:25,445
- No. No.
- I need you.

1525
02:18:25,601 --> 02:18:27,547
Come here.

1526
02:18:27,767 --> 02:18:30,475
No! No!

1527
02:18:30,934 --> 02:18:31,935
Pm Negro!

1528
02:18:34,734 --> 02:18:37,943
My pappy was Colonel Jackson
and my <i>mammy</i> was a slave woman.

1529
02:18:38,701 --> 02:18:40,647
- Slut!
- Aah!

1530
02:18:44,234 --> 02:18:45,770
Here.

1531
02:18:49,501 --> 02:18:50,980
Bitch!

1532
02:18:53,001 --> 02:18:54,002
Aah!

1533
02:19:03,834 --> 02:19:08,749
You'll get what cheap
Negro bitches deserve.

1534
02:19:42,334 --> 02:19:43,438
You told him.

1535
02:19:43,734 --> 02:19:45,577
You come out of there, you nigger whore.

1536
02:19:45,734 --> 02:19:48,840
How could you tell him?
How could you tell him?

1537
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,140
You knew you were playing with file!
How many warnings did you need?

1538
02:19:52,967 --> 02:19:54,139
He raped me.

1539
02:19:54,300 --> 02:19:57,941
And you told him
to save your precious virginity.

1540
02:19:58,100 --> 02:20:00,307
Well. let me tell you what it cost.

1541
02:20:00,467 --> 02:20:01,946
Wold will spread like wildfire.

1542
02:20:02,101 --> 02:20:05,708
A couple mulattos in here passing as white.
Then you know what's gonna happen?

1543
02:20:05,867 --> 02:20:08,040
At the very least
George is gonna heal...

1544
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:11,010
...and I'll lose him
all because of your precious virginity!

1545
02:20:11,167 --> 02:20:13,613
No one got the right
to take it away from me. No one.

1546
02:20:13,767 --> 02:20:16,247
Oh. you're not special.
We've all been raped.

1547
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:17,902
I thought you was my friend.

1548
02:20:18,067 --> 02:20:20,513
You're too dangerous
to be anyone's friend.

1549
02:20:20,667 --> 02:20:23,204
You're living in a dream.
You're not in the real world.

1550
02:20:23,367 --> 02:20:26,246
And you're not Little Miss In-Between.
You're high and mighty.

1551
02:20:26,401 --> 02:20:28,574
“My pappy was a colonel.
I lived in a mansion.“

1552
02:20:28,734 --> 02:20:31,874
- My pappy loved me.
- Then why did he let you go?

1553
02:20:32,033 --> 02:20:35,242
You've got to get out of here.
I'm gonna tell them I kicked you out.

1554
02:20:35,401 --> 02:20:37,074
That I found out and I made you go.

1555
02:20:37,234 --> 02:20:38,872
No, Alice. I ain't got no one else.

1556
02:20:39,034 --> 02:20:41,981
- Go back to your precious pappy.
- I can't. This is all I got.

1557
02:20:42,134 --> 02:20:44,205
Well, there ain't nothing left here.
Not now.

1558
02:20:44,367 --> 02:20:46,904
Go anywhere. Somewhere.
I don't care where.

1559
02:20:47,067 --> 02:20:50,139
Just get as far away from here
and as far away from rne as possible.

1560
02:20:50,301 --> 02:20:53,180
No, Alice, please, I'm begging you.
Don't make me go, Alice.

1561
02:20:53,334 --> 02:20:56,679
- I'm begging you.
- Why did you tell him?

1562
02:20:56,833 --> 02:20:58,540
Why?

1563
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:12,711
Help me! I'm hungry. Please. help me!

1564
02:21:21,401 --> 02:21:24,177
Your <i>mammy</i> was a kindly woman.

1565
02:21:24,334 --> 02:21:28,441
I seen her conjure up all kinds of haints
out in the hollow in the woods.

1566
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:31,740
Ooh, I seen her too myself once.

1567
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:34,904
I need some more wood.
bring more down.

1568
02:21:35,067 --> 02:21:38,241
Gill. what's wrong with you?

1569
02:21:38,834 --> 02:21:39,869
Getting some idea.

1570
02:21:40,034 --> 02:21:42,241
Not a problem
because I brought some more food.

1571
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:43,777
Mm-hm.

1572
02:21:54,134 --> 02:21:55,511
I need a place to sleep.

1573
02:21:56,901 --> 02:21:58,574
Over there.

1574
02:22:16,967 --> 02:22:18,947
Hey. you hungry?

1575
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:41,178
Then eat that, white bitch.

1576
02:23:22,967 --> 02:23:26,039
Run! This home burning!

1577
02:23:36,333 --> 02:23:38,313
Frankie's still in there!

1578
02:23:38,467 --> 02:23:40,640
Oh. God. somebody help him, please!

1579
02:24:55,467 --> 02:24:57,708
Help me. Lord.

1580
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:01,540
Can't go on like this forever.

1581
02:25:07,667 --> 02:25:10,546
- How long...
- How long?

1582
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:13,374
- ...is forever?
- That's right.

1583
02:25:13,534 --> 02:25:15,639
- Is it a moment?
- Oh. no.

1584
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:17,507
- A day?
- No.

1585
02:25:17,667 --> 02:25:18,941
- Year?
- No.

1586
02:25:19,101 --> 02:25:21,240
- A lifetime?
- No.

1587
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:23,437
Or is it forever?

1588
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:28,871
Forever is eternity.

1589
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:32,672
- And this vale of tears is not eternal.
- No, sir.

1590
02:25:32,833 --> 02:25:35,177
Our wretched misery on this earth...

1591
02:25:35,334 --> 02:25:38,804
...is but a moment
in the blanket of God's eye.

1592
02:25:39,134 --> 02:25:42,411
When that moment we call life is done...

1593
02:25:42,567 --> 02:25:45,207
...we will be taken up in glory...

1594
02:25:45,367 --> 02:25:50,180
...we will bask in the sun
of God's loving glory.

1595
02:25:50,333 --> 02:25:54,679
We will dwell in the bosom
of the Lord in glory.

1596
02:25:54,834 --> 02:25:59,340
Not for a moment,
not for a year, not for a lifetime...

1597
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:02,743
...but forever and forever...
- Ever, ever, ever.

1598
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:07,713
...and forever in glory.

1599
02:26:13,667 --> 02:26:18,514
Help me. Somebody. help me.

1600
02:26:20,334 --> 02:26:21,369
Help me!

1601
02:26:22,667 --> 02:26:24,112
Please.

1602
02:26:25,034 --> 02:26:26,172
Help.

1603
02:26:28,434 --> 02:26:30,607
I Negro.

1604
02:26:35,034 --> 02:26:37,173
I Negro.

1605
02:26:38,133 --> 02:26:39,510
Help me.

1606
02:26:39,667 --> 02:26:41,806
Help me. God. I need help!

1607
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,207
I need food! Help me!

1608
02:26:44,367 --> 02:26:46,438
Help me. I scaled.

1609
02:26:46,601 --> 02:26:51,072
Help me. somebody help me. please.
Help me.

1610
02:26:51,234 --> 02:26:53,805
It's all right,
we gonna take care of you now.

1611
02:26:54,634 --> 02:26:56,341
Help me!

1612
02:26:56,534 --> 02:27:01,677
Lord. Lord, I scared, I scared...

1613
02:27:06,534 --> 02:27:10,346
Excellent jaw. She'll do splendidly.

1614
02:27:10,501 --> 02:27:14,108
So light and lovely teeth.

1615
02:27:14,267 --> 02:27:15,974
Thank you for bringing her.

1616
02:27:16,133 --> 02:27:17,806
Oh. I don't mind staying. ma'am.

1617
02:27:17,967 --> 02:27:21,744
There's no need, but if you wish,
you may wait in the kitchen.

1618
02:27:23,667 --> 02:27:29,015
Now. Queen. isn't it?
A very odd name.

1619
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:32,178
We should be pleased to take you
into service.

1620
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,478
You'll find us stern taskrnasters,
but fair, I think.

1621
02:27:37,634 --> 02:27:39,807
And you'll get your board and keep.

1622
02:27:39,967 --> 02:27:42,948
Good, honest pay for good, honest work.

1623
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:45,842
If any would not work,
neither should he eat.

1624
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,809
Thessalonians 3:10.

1625
02:27:48,767 --> 02:27:49,837
Yes. ma'am.

1626
02:27:50,434 --> 02:27:54,314
And you should be careful
who your friends are, Queen.

1627
02:27:54,700 --> 02:27:57,772
Obviously. you've had a good education.

1628
02:27:57,933 --> 02:28:01,005
Many of the Negroes here
have not been so fortunate.

1629
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:04,576
That is why we have a mission to them.

1630
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:05,970
Yes. ma'am.

1631
02:28:06,134 --> 02:28:07,738
That's settled. then.

1632
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:10,779
You may say goodbye to your friend.

1633
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:16,242
Oh. After we've said a little player.

1634
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:34,677
Men go forth under his work,
under his labor.

1635
02:28:34,834 --> 02:28:38,111
O Lord, how manifold are thy works!

1636
02:28:38,267 --> 02:28:42,807
In wisdom hast thou made them all.

1637
02:28:49,533 --> 02:28:50,739
They dragons.

1638
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:54,677
Yeah. but their tile pretty old now.
Besides. you need a job...

1639
02:28:54,834 --> 02:28:58,441
...and there ain't many o1 them around.
You have any problem. you come see me.

1640
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:00,477
- I can handle them two.
- I'll be fine.

1641
02:29:00,633 --> 02:29:03,477
I just gotta be careful
who my friends are.

1642
02:29:04,801 --> 02:29:06,803
Well. you best not hang around
with me then. child.

1643
02:29:06,967 --> 02:29:09,538
I is too black for them.
I see you in church on Sunday.

1644
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:10,838
All light.

1645
02:29:35,434 --> 02:29:36,504
Dinner ready. ma'am.

1646
02:29:37,201 --> 02:29:39,044
Thank you. Queen.

1647
02:29:43,434 --> 02:29:45,641
Did you go to church
this morning. Queen?

1648
02:29:45,801 --> 02:29:48,805
Oh. yes. ma'am. Miss Gifhey.
It's Sunday.

1649
02:29:48,967 --> 02:29:51,777
- Was it a good service?
- Oh. yes. ma'am.

1650
02:29:51,934 --> 02:29:53,914
They nearly lifted the roof off.

1651
02:29:54,067 --> 02:29:58,447
- Paganism.
- VVe prefer quieter appreciation of our Lord.

1652
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:03,649
But it was wonderful, Miss Mandy.
The spirit surely moved.

1653
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:07,304
Clapping and dancing and shouting.
This is heathen behavior.

1654
02:30:07,467 --> 02:30:11,279
- Idolatry.
- African ritual.

1655
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:14,203
You're a good gill, Queen.

1656
02:30:14,801 --> 02:30:18,510
It is our dearest wish
that you should come to our church...

1657
02:30:18,667 --> 02:30:22,114
...and contemplate the wonders of the Lord
in calm and quiet.

1658
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:25,476
Maybe the Lord moves
in mysterious ways.

1659
02:30:25,634 --> 02:30:28,410
That's very true, Queen.
Perhaps you are his test of us.

1660
02:30:28,567 --> 02:30:32,379
Oh, no, I promise.
I working hard for my Saviofs love.

1661
02:30:32,534 --> 02:30:34,138
Very good. very good.

1662
02:30:34,300 --> 02:30:39,079
Then say your players with us.
Then you can go to your dinner.

1663
02:30:39,233 --> 02:30:43,079
O Lord,
we thank thee for thy precious bounty.

1664
02:30:43,234 --> 02:30:46,772
And for the blessings
thou hast bestowed upon us.

1665
02:30:46,934 --> 02:30:49,540
Consecrate this food, O Lord...

1666
02:30:49,701 --> 02:30:53,774
...in the name of our Savior,
Jesus Christ, amen.

1667
02:30:53,934 --> 02:30:56,005
- Amen.
- Amen.

1668
02:31:32,734 --> 02:31:34,805
What you think you're doing?

1669
02:31:35,367 --> 02:31:38,644
- I cleaning up your garden.
- Why?

1670
02:31:39,067 --> 02:31:40,637
I looking for work.

1671
02:31:41,334 --> 02:31:42,642
Who told you to do that?

1672
02:31:43,633 --> 02:31:45,408
Now. I took it on my own authority.

1673
02:31:45,767 --> 02:31:49,738
Get out <i>o1</i> here. you heal me? OI I gonna
tell on you. I gonna call the missus.

1674
02:31:49,901 --> 02:31:52,848
Well. now. you just do that.

1675
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,104
Miss Mandy?

1676
02:31:56,200 --> 02:31:57,873
Miss Mandy?

1677
02:31:58,034 --> 02:32:01,277
What is it, Queen? What's wrong?

1678
02:32:01,667 --> 02:32:02,941
Who is that man?

1679
02:32:03,601 --> 02:32:06,343
Begging your pardon, ma'am.
My name Davis.

1680
02:32:06,501 --> 02:32:10,472
- I guess you be the lady of the house.
- Get out at once before I call for help.

1681
02:32:10,667 --> 02:32:13,443
<i>Now. You can do that. ma'am.
You got every fight.</i>

1682
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:16,604
But your garden a mess.
And I looking for work.

1683
02:32:18,334 --> 02:32:19,870
You could have asked.

1684
02:32:20,333 --> 02:32:23,906
I begging your pardon. ma'am.
I big and I black.

1685
02:32:24,067 --> 02:32:26,946
L1 I come banging on your door.
would you have given me the time <i>o1</i> day?

1686
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:29,580
- That's hardly the point.
- It is to me now. ma'am.

1687
02:32:29,733 --> 02:32:31,804
If you can see your way clear
to employ me...

1688
02:32:31,967 --> 02:32:33,844
...well, I'll work for you right hard.

1689
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:39,479
But if you prefer not or can't afford rne,
I'll give you this afternoon for free.

1690
02:32:39,634 --> 02:32:41,978
Because I hate to see a garden
looking like this.

1691
02:32:42,134 --> 02:32:44,614
You're very sure of yourself, young man.

1692
02:32:45,467 --> 02:32:47,413
Can't see no reason not to be. ma'am.

1693
02:32:51,667 --> 02:32:53,977
Well, I'll take your offer
of a free afternoon.

1694
02:32:55,367 --> 02:33:00,043
If the work is satisfactory,
I will consider some regular employment.

1695
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:01,770
I will be watching you.

1696
02:33:02,634 --> 02:33:04,944
I thank you kindly. ma'am.

1697
02:33:18,733 --> 02:33:20,110
The loses need pruning.

1698
02:33:21,167 --> 02:33:25,912
They do, but not now.
Wrong time of year.

1699
02:33:39,267 --> 02:33:43,010
The devil finds work
for idle hands, Queen.

1700
02:33:43,434 --> 02:33:45,971
I want to finish making jelly today.

1701
02:33:46,134 --> 02:33:49,843
- And then the stove must be blacked.
- Yes. ma'am.

1702
02:33:50,567 --> 02:33:54,447
And why don't you take out
some lemonade to that gardener?

1703
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:57,137
He's a good worker.
and it's a hot day.

1704
02:33:57,300 --> 02:33:59,007
Yes. ma'am.

1705
02:33:59,733 --> 02:34:05,342
It's rare to find a Negro
with such self-confidence, yet so polite.

1706
02:34:05,733 --> 02:34:09,579
It gives me hope that our work
is not entirely in vain.

1707
02:34:10,867 --> 02:34:15,782
I wonder. does he know he has a friend
in Jesus?

1708
02:34:18,001 --> 02:34:21,107
You can have a bleak. she said.

1709
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:27,407
You're doing a good job. she said.

1710
02:34:30,334 --> 02:34:32,280
I'm gonna give you dinner tonightm.

1711
02:34:35,434 --> 02:34:36,811
Before you go home.

1712
02:34:36,967 --> 02:34:41,245
- She said that too.
- Well. better do like she say then. huh?

1713
02:34:43,667 --> 02:34:45,010
Who done that to your back?

1714
02:34:47,834 --> 02:34:50,280
Old master in the slave day.

1715
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:03,206
- A little more pie?
- NO. thank you. ma'am.

1716
02:35:03,367 --> 02:35:05,278
That was very fine.

1717
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:08,939
Where you learn to cook like that?

1718
02:35:09,467 --> 02:35:12,038
- On the plantation.
- Mm.

1719
02:35:12,434 --> 02:35:14,641
Sure is good.

1720
02:35:16,767 --> 02:35:19,145
Why they whip you so bad?

1721
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:24,907
Master ain't liked my way.

1722
02:35:26,201 --> 02:35:28,340
I didn't wanna be no slave.

1723
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:30,571
It wasn't my idea of life.

1724
02:35:31,033 --> 02:35:33,411
So they tried to whip some fear into me.

1725
02:35:33,567 --> 02:35:37,208
- Well. that's over now.
- Ain't changed much.

1726
02:35:37,934 --> 02:35:39,880
I mean. I flee.

1727
02:35:41,067 --> 02:35:43,069
But they still treat me
like afield nigger.

1728
02:35:43,734 --> 02:35:46,681
I don't wanna have to beg for change
from a white man pocket.

1729
02:35:47,267 --> 02:35:50,840
Don't wanna live a life where I ain't never
gonna be able to better myself.

1730
02:35:51,001 --> 02:35:52,503
Flee or not.

1731
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,105
So I taking charge of my life.

1732
02:35:59,700 --> 02:36:01,873
I looking for my place.

1733
02:36:03,834 --> 02:36:05,814
I looking for where I belong.

1734
02:36:08,001 --> 02:36:10,106
I looking too.

1735
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:21,643
That was a fine meal. ma'am.

1736
02:36:23,434 --> 02:36:25,436
I thank you kindly.

1737
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:32,038
You know...

1738
02:36:35,467 --> 02:36:38,573
...you have a friend in Jesus.

1739
02:37:35,501 --> 02:37:38,141
- What you done?
- Oh. cut my shoulder...

1740
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:40,678
...chopping on this old tree trunk.

1741
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:45,173
Well. I could do that.

1742
02:37:46,201 --> 02:37:47,703
Thank you.

1743
02:37:55,233 --> 02:37:56,678
Did it hurt?

1744
02:37:56,834 --> 02:38:00,043
Oh, it was worth it for this.

1745
02:38:00,934 --> 02:38:02,379
You got magic hands.

1746
02:38:03,601 --> 02:38:06,878
My <i>mammy</i> taught me.
It was my pappy favorite thing.

1747
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:11,902
I meant...

1748
02:38:12,067 --> 02:38:15,537
...did these hurt?

1749
02:38:16,767 --> 02:38:18,110
Ain't you never been beat?

1750
02:38:19,501 --> 02:38:22,277
Not really.
I got the switch a few time.

1751
02:38:23,367 --> 02:38:24,937
The switch.

1752
02:38:29,067 --> 02:38:31,274
What they say...

1753
02:38:31,434 --> 02:38:33,937
...you don't feel it
after the first few lash...

1754
02:38:34,100 --> 02:38:36,080
...that ain't true.

1755
02:38:36,567 --> 02:38:38,342
You feel every sting of it.

1756
02:38:40,234 --> 02:38:44,580
Cut across your back like a razor
and go on cutting.

1757
02:38:46,667 --> 02:38:50,114
All you feel is this terrible pain...

1758
02:38:50,267 --> 02:38:54,181
...and this dreadful anger
that they got the power to do this to you.

1759
02:38:55,234 --> 02:38:56,975
Just because you black.

1760
02:39:03,067 --> 02:39:07,209
And you hate them with every ounce
oi hate you got inside you...

1761
02:39:07,367 --> 02:39:08,675
“.101 doing this to you.

1762
02:39:09,667 --> 02:39:12,978
Don't hate. Ain't no need for hate now.

1763
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:18,376
That's all there is.

1764
02:39:19,867 --> 02:39:21,471
No.

1765
02:39:23,401 --> 02:39:25,381
There's love.

1766
02:40:07,401 --> 02:40:08,436
Did I hurt you?

1767
02:40:11,467 --> 02:40:13,708
I thought I was gonna die...

1768
02:40:13,867 --> 02:40:15,107
...from love.

1769
02:40:18,334 --> 02:40:20,644
Oh. my sweet Queen.

1770
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:26,738
You got more love in you
than anybody I've ever known.

1771
02:40:30,067 --> 02:40:32,946
You're all filled up with love.

1772
02:40:33,334 --> 02:40:35,405
And you?

1773
02:40:41,467 --> 02:40:43,743
Don't know how much loom
there is in my heart.

1774
02:40:45,567 --> 02:40:47,103
I only little.

1775
02:40:47,267 --> 02:40:49,804
Only need a tiny space.

1776
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:53,876
I want your child.

1777
02:40:59,167 --> 02:41:02,114
I wouldn't bring a child into this world.

1778
02:41:03,833 --> 02:41:07,042
Wouldn't have to many me.
unless you wanted to.

1779
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:09,043
I wouldn't make you.

1780
02:41:11,367 --> 02:41:13,074
My deal...

1781
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:16,407
...you can't make me.

1782
02:41:17,734 --> 02:41:21,477
Nobody can make me do nothing
I don't wanna do. Not no more.

1783
02:41:24,733 --> 02:41:26,804
Would it be so terrible?

1784
02:41:31,501 --> 02:41:33,674
There's nothing...

1785
02:41:33,834 --> 02:41:36,440
“.101 a Negro boy in this world...

1786
02:41:36,601 --> 02:41:39,639
...except pain and humiliation.

1787
02:41:41,067 --> 02:41:45,607
It ain't always gonna be like that.
Not always.

1788
02:41:45,767 --> 02:41:47,940
It will be like that.

1789
02:41:49,867 --> 02:41:53,747
Always and always and always.

1790
02:41:54,501 --> 02:41:57,539
I will not bring a child into this world...

1791
02:41:57,700 --> 02:42:01,011
...till I have made this a better world
to bring a child into.

1792
02:42:08,601 --> 02:42:09,875
There now.

1793
02:42:12,134 --> 02:42:14,341
I made you cry.

1794
02:42:15,634 --> 02:42:18,808
It's all level seem to do...

1795
02:42:18,967 --> 02:42:21,277
...is make people cry.

1796
02:42:36,167 --> 02:42:39,876
<i>O</i> Lord. we thank thee to! thy bounty
and to! thy many blessings...

1797
02:42:40,034 --> 02:42:42,674
...on these thy humble servants.

1798
02:42:42,867 --> 02:42:44,744
Queen, what on earth are you doing?

1799
02:42:44,901 --> 02:42:45,971
Nothing.

1800
02:42:46,134 --> 02:42:49,946
I saw you take that biscuit.
What's the matter?

1801
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:53,274
Don't we feed you enough
that you must steal from our very table?

1802
02:42:53,467 --> 02:42:55,504
The Eighth Commandment.

1803
02:42:55,667 --> 02:42:59,945
- I think you'd better go to your room, miss.
- After you put the biscuit back.

1804
02:43:14,767 --> 02:43:17,646
Nest in our warrant.

1805
02:43:46,467 --> 02:43:49,880
And she say it's your own.
And she ain't no lie.

1806
02:43:50,034 --> 02:43:52,310
So, what you gonna do about it?

1807
02:43:53,534 --> 02:43:55,639
I sorry.

1808
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:59,441
Ain't thrilled about it.
And you know why.

1809
02:44:00,767 --> 02:44:02,474
But it done.

1810
02:44:03,634 --> 02:44:05,944
So I guess I'm gonna
have to stand by you.

1811
02:44:08,300 --> 02:44:10,610
Not so fast, rnissy.

1812
02:44:10,934 --> 02:44:13,778
You don't get out of here that easy.

1813
02:44:13,934 --> 02:44:17,677
Now, she wasn't gonna tell you because
she didn't wanna force you to wed her.

1814
02:44:18,267 --> 02:44:21,680
But she don't want you if you just
marrying her because you feel you gotta.

1815
02:44:21,934 --> 02:44:24,141
She don't want you
if you don't love her.

1816
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,310
Ain't sure I know what love is.

1817
02:44:31,434 --> 02:44:34,142
If I'm gonna find out from anybody,
I reckon it's you.

1818
02:44:36,167 --> 02:44:37,942
I surely hope so.

1819
02:44:39,134 --> 02:44:41,478
Because if you don't care for this gal...

1820
02:44:42,634 --> 02:44:45,342
...and cherish her...

1821
02:44:45,501 --> 02:44:51,543
...I'll find out and I'll come for you
wherever you be...

1822
02:44:51,700 --> 02:44:53,702
...and I'll fix ii...

1823
02:44:53,867 --> 02:44:59,112
...so you don't never give no pool gal
no baby again.

1824
02:44:59,934 --> 02:45:01,242
You know I will.

1825
02:45:07,467 --> 02:45:09,674
I know you will.

1826
02:45:12,267 --> 02:45:14,645
Now...

1827
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:16,279
...you can go to him.

1828
02:46:03,601 --> 02:46:05,808
- Is that all you taking?
- That's all I got.

1829
02:46:05,967 --> 02:46:08,504
- Sure you don't want me to come?
- No, you go to church.

1830
02:46:08,667 --> 02:46:10,374
He said he'll meet me there at noon.

1831
02:46:10,534 --> 02:46:13,174
What a man say and what a man do
be two different things.

1832
02:46:13,334 --> 02:46:16,178
- Now. you know where you're going?
- Up north. I guess.

1833
02:46:16,334 --> 02:46:20,111
Now. it you ever need anything.
you come straight on back to me. you heal?

1834
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:21,845
Here.

1835
02:46:22,901 --> 02:46:25,245
Now, you have a dance for me
at your wedding.

1836
02:46:25,401 --> 02:46:27,472
<i>Qka'! -</i>

1837
02:46:27,633 --> 02:46:30,876
- I gotta go. I can't keep him waiting.
- Okay.

1838
02:46:31,034 --> 02:46:34,311
You take care of yourself now,
you hear?

1839
02:47:50,500 --> 02:47:52,537
I knowed he would. I had a feeling.

1840
02:47:52,700 --> 02:47:54,976
I never said he was gonna many me.
You said that.

1841
02:47:55,133 --> 02:47:58,342
- Said he was gonna stand by you.
- I guess he got better things to do.

1842
02:47:58,501 --> 02:48:00,412
Ain't no use in crying about it now.

1843
02:48:05,967 --> 02:48:07,674
Think it's gonna hurt?

1844
02:48:07,834 --> 02:48:09,711
I can't imagine it'd be easy.

1845
02:48:09,867 --> 02:48:12,473
But you ain't got no other choice now.

1846
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:16,537
Evening. Miss Esther.

1847
02:48:16,767 --> 02:48:19,111
This little sister here needs your help.

1848
02:48:22,701 --> 02:48:26,080
I do got a choice.
I gonna keep my child.

1849
02:48:28,034 --> 02:48:31,675
A wicked. naughty gill.
that's what you are.

1850
02:48:31,833 --> 02:48:34,609
Now. you leave the child be.
She been through enough.

1851
02:48:34,767 --> 02:48:36,769
How dale you address me that way?

1852
02:48:36,933 --> 02:48:39,243
I address you any way I want.

1853
02:48:39,401 --> 02:48:41,972
This gill need help. Not your sermon.

1854
02:48:42,134 --> 02:48:44,273
Out of the house.
Out of the house this minute.

1855
02:48:44,434 --> 02:48:47,608
And where is she going to get this help?

1856
02:48:47,901 --> 02:48:50,108
I take he! with me.

1857
02:48:50,501 --> 02:48:53,209
I give he! all the love and care she need.
Queen. get your thing.

1858
02:48:53,367 --> 02:48:55,347
Not so fast.

1859
02:48:55,733 --> 02:49:01,684
Now, of all things to consider here,
such as the child's immortal soul...

1860
02:49:01,834 --> 02:49:03,609
...Queen is lost.

1861
02:49:03,767 --> 02:49:06,213
All the players in Christendom
couldn't save he! now.

1862
02:49:06,367 --> 02:49:10,247
- But the child is another matter.
- Precious burden, an innocent babe.

1863
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:12,744
I will not let the child into your care.

1864
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:16,313
It will have the advantage
oi a propel Christian upbringing.

1865
02:49:17,567 --> 02:49:18,739
I Christian.

1866
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:24,111
And since we must look after the child,
we must also look after Queen.

1867
02:49:24,267 --> 02:49:26,076
It's our duty.

1868
02:49:26,234 --> 02:49:27,577
Fallen sinner.

1869
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:31,942
I won't let he! stay here. Come on.

1870
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:34,478
And how will you stop it?

1871
02:49:34,634 --> 02:49:36,272
Queen is in our employ.

1872
02:49:36,434 --> 02:49:40,348
And I doubt that the authorities would
consider you more suitable than us.

1873
02:49:41,634 --> 02:49:44,478
If she should leave here,
of course, she wouldn't have a job.

1874
02:49:44,634 --> 02:49:47,308
And I can't think
she would easily find another.

1875
02:49:47,467 --> 02:49:48,969
He! condition.

1876
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:52,109
I stay.

1877
02:49:52,934 --> 02:49:54,811
I have to.

1878
02:49:56,267 --> 02:50:00,044
A fairly graceless response, Queen.

1879
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:02,441
A little gratitude might be in older.

1880
02:50:02,967 --> 02:50:05,470
Yes. ma'am. Thank you.

1881
02:50:06,001 --> 02:50:08,208
That's settled then.

1882
02:50:08,367 --> 02:50:10,210
Now, off to bed with you.

1883
02:50:10,367 --> 02:50:13,576
You need your rest, for the child's sake.

1884
02:50:16,067 --> 02:50:19,207
You need anything. you let me know.

1885
02:50:19,367 --> 02:50:23,907
There is nothing she needs from you
and you are not welcome here.

1886
02:50:28,100 --> 02:50:31,638
Remember your prayers tonight, Queen.

1887
02:50:33,467 --> 02:50:36,471
Bless and protect my little child. Lord.

1888
02:50:36,634 --> 02:50:40,946
Let him be born whole and complete.
in thy likeness.

1889
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:45,014
And please. Lord. let him love me.

1890
02:50:45,167 --> 02:50:49,843
And don't let them two old dragons
be too hard on me.

1891
02:50:50,334 --> 02:50:52,177
Amen.

1892
02:50:57,134 --> 02:50:59,512
Queen. are you sure
you're all light out here?

1893
02:50:59,667 --> 02:51:03,274
- Oh. I be fine. Miss Gifhey.
- Don't want you catching cold.

1894
02:51:03,434 --> 02:51:05,607
You know. you didn't finish
your chores today.

1895
02:51:05,767 --> 02:51:09,180
We'll forgive you now, in view of the...

1896
02:51:10,267 --> 02:51:12,747
But once he's born...

1897
02:51:13,134 --> 02:51:16,013
Why you so sure it gonna be a boy?

1898
02:51:16,167 --> 02:51:18,511
Well, I don't know, of course.
How could I?

1899
02:51:18,667 --> 02:51:21,045
Now. don't sit out here too long.

1900
02:51:21,834 --> 02:51:25,646
She's convinced it'll be a boy
because she wants it to be a boy.

1901
02:51:25,801 --> 02:51:27,747
We both do.

1902
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:31,107
What's it like. Queen?

1903
02:51:32,934 --> 02:51:35,938
- Heavy.
- No, I mean...

1904
02:51:36,501 --> 02:51:38,708
...what's it really like?

1905
02:51:39,034 --> 02:51:42,174
How does it feel in your heart?

1906
02:51:44,101 --> 02:51:49,346
Well, I feel full up with him.

1907
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:52,242
Complete with love for him.

1908
02:51:53,434 --> 02:51:55,539
I think it's gonna be a boy too.

1909
02:51:58,333 --> 02:52:02,110
Heel him glowing inside me.

1910
02:52:02,267 --> 02:52:04,042
Kicking inside me.

1911
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:09,546
Part of my body, and all of my love.

1912
02:52:11,034 --> 02:52:14,675
I don't know what I gonna do
if he don't love me.

1913
02:52:15,500 --> 02:52:18,174
Can't imagine why he wouldn't.

1914
02:52:18,900 --> 02:52:23,076
Ain't nobody ever gonna
take him away hom me.

1915
02:52:24,734 --> 02:52:28,341
Except God. maybe.

1916
02:52:30,234 --> 02:52:33,272
I envy you so much.

1917
02:52:35,033 --> 02:52:36,603
Both of us do.

1918
02:52:39,167 --> 02:52:42,011
Don't you think we didn't long
to be married?

1919
02:52:42,167 --> 02:52:44,579
Yearn to have children?

1920
02:52:46,801 --> 02:52:49,941
We never found the right man,
either of us.

1921
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:52,239
OI they didn't find us.

1922
02:52:53,567 --> 02:52:57,811
Then the war came along
and took most of the men away.

1923
02:52:59,800 --> 02:53:01,837
And we got old.

1924
02:53:04,433 --> 02:53:08,347
We spend our lives
trying to increase God's family...

1925
02:53:08,500 --> 02:53:10,502
H1101 OUI OWN.

1926
02:53:12,734 --> 02:53:18,013
But I would give almost anything...

1927
02:53:19,734 --> 02:53:22,374
...to know what it feels like...

1928
02:53:22,534 --> 02:53:24,946
...really feels like...

1929
02:53:25,367 --> 02:53:27,369
...in my heart.

1930
02:53:44,634 --> 02:53:47,513
Don't make it worse for me.

1931
02:53:58,467 --> 02:54:00,674
- Come on. girl. push.
- Shouldn't we get help?

1932
02:54:00,834 --> 02:54:04,907
Nonsense. we're nearly there.
We don't need any... Push. Queen.

1933
02:54:05,067 --> 02:54:06,978
I can see it, I can see it!

1934
02:54:07,134 --> 02:54:09,978
O Lord, come to our aid in this,
our hour of need.

1935
02:54:10,134 --> 02:54:14,640
Oh, please, get off your knees, woman,
and get rne a sheet.

1936
02:54:14,801 --> 02:54:17,509
We're there, Queen. We're there.

1937
02:54:17,667 --> 02:54:23,913
And oh. bless my cotton socks.
it's a boy!

1938
02:54:24,067 --> 02:54:25,774
I got the knife. Here's the knife.

1939
02:54:42,234 --> 02:54:43,679
Let me see him.

1940
02:54:43,834 --> 02:54:46,678
In a minute, Queen. we've got things to do.

1941
02:54:46,833 --> 02:54:50,474
My child. He mine. I wanna see him.

1942
02:54:51,100 --> 02:54:53,842
Wait a minute, you ungrateful girl.

1943
02:54:54,001 --> 02:54:56,675
He's not really very dark.

1944
02:54:57,267 --> 02:54:59,304
Perhaps he'll get lighter as he gets older.

1945
02:54:59,467 --> 02:55:01,879
I want my child. Let me see him.

1946
02:55:02,034 --> 02:55:05,846
He's a very fine. very handsome baby.

1947
02:55:06,001 --> 02:55:10,347
We must think of a special name for him.

1948
02:55:12,801 --> 02:55:14,280
David.

1949
02:55:14,434 --> 02:55:17,347
I gonna call him David.

1950
02:55:17,501 --> 02:55:21,176
Oh. I don't think
that's entirely suitable, Queen.

1951
02:55:21,667 --> 02:55:23,476
But it means beloved.

1952
02:55:23,634 --> 02:55:26,740
Not at all suitable,
David was an adulterer.

1953
02:55:26,901 --> 02:55:29,006
Pool Bathsheba's husband.

1954
02:55:29,167 --> 02:55:31,579
We thought Abner.

1955
02:55:31,734 --> 02:55:34,510
I gonna name him David.

1956
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:56,348
I baptize this child, Abner, in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1957
02:55:56,500 --> 02:55:58,639
- Amen.
- Amen.

1958
02:55:58,801 --> 02:56:02,908
This child is thus acknowledged
to be a member oi Christ's Church...

1959
02:56:03,067 --> 02:56:06,446
...and is commended to thy care
and love.

1960
02:56:17,434 --> 02:56:19,175
Miss Mandy wants you to feed Abner.

1961
02:56:20,567 --> 02:56:23,707
She always want him fed.
He gonna bust from feeding.

1962
02:56:23,867 --> 02:56:27,041
Well, he's crying now. You best go see.

1963
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:29,476
Do that brass aflelwalds.

1964
02:56:30,133 --> 02:56:31,976
Yes. ma'am.

1965
02:56:38,467 --> 02:56:40,743
He's starving. Queen.
Where have you been?

1966
02:56:40,900 --> 02:56:43,813
Probably just the burps,
he already been fed.

1967
02:56:43,967 --> 02:56:48,438
That was four hours ago.
I have it written down.

1968
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:52,742
Oh, no, feed him here,
you know I like to watch.

1969
02:56:53,300 --> 02:56:56,474
It ain't fitting. private business
between me and my boy.

1970
02:56:56,634 --> 02:57:00,548
It can't do him any harm.
and it pleases me.

1971
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:21,243
[SINGING “THERE'S A FRIEND
FOR LITTLE CHILDFIEN"I

1972
02:58:18,434 --> 02:58:21,347
You take the heavy end. Gifhey.

1973
02:58:28,334 --> 02:58:29,904
What you doing with that?

1974
02:58:30,367 --> 02:58:33,644
I have decided to move Abner
into my loom.

1975
02:58:33,801 --> 02:58:35,940
No, you leave that be.

1976
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:40,105
I believe it would be best for the child.
And you must know I'm right.

1977
02:58:41,134 --> 02:58:44,047
Best thing to! the child
is to stay with his mammy.

1978
02:58:44,200 --> 02:58:47,306
The child can't stay with you.
it puts his soul in danger.

1979
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,877
You don't care nothing about his soul.

1980
02:58:50,033 --> 02:58:53,139
You just want him because you can't
have no child of your own...

1981
02:58:53,301 --> 02:58:54,837
...you old. dried-up old thing.

1982
02:58:55,001 --> 02:58:56,776
Don't be ridiculous.

1983
02:58:56,934 --> 02:58:58,971
We're not trying to steal your child.

1984
02:58:59,134 --> 02:59:01,705
We're trying to give him
the benefit of a decent life...

1985
02:59:01,867 --> 02:59:05,110
...and the promise of salvation,
which is more than you can do.

1986
02:59:05,267 --> 02:59:06,541
You'll still see him.

1987
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:08,702
You ain't taking him. He mine.

1988
02:59:08,867 --> 02:59:10,869
The only thing that ever been truly mine.

1989
02:59:11,034 --> 02:59:14,208
- You're hysterical.
- You can't take him!

1990
02:59:14,734 --> 02:59:19,012
Very well, IL you won't listen to reason.
I will have to lollow with some other course.

1991
02:59:19,167 --> 02:59:22,774
- Come along, Giffrey.
- Harlot. Jezebel.

1992
02:59:24,967 --> 02:59:27,948
You will regret this. Queen.

1993
02:59:42,200 --> 02:59:43,645
Queen.

1994
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:47,507
Haven't seen you for a while.

1995
02:59:48,167 --> 02:59:50,613
I ain't been able to come.

1996
02:59:50,767 --> 02:59:52,747
Something troubling you?

1997
02:59:55,034 --> 02:59:56,775
My child.

1998
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:59,138
Is he sick?

1999
03:00:01,534 --> 03:00:02,979
No.

2000
03:00:03,401 --> 03:00:06,405
Fine as can be, for all I know.

2001
03:00:07,101 --> 03:00:08,774
I ain't seen him.

2002
03:00:11,034 --> 03:00:12,069
He's your baby.

2003
03:00:13,434 --> 03:00:16,745
Not the way Miss Mandy take him over.

2004
03:00:16,901 --> 03:00:19,313
Like he he! child.

2005
03:00:19,467 --> 03:00:22,676
I just some farm animal that bred him.

2006
03:00:27,467 --> 03:00:29,469
Miss Mandy's a good Christian woman.

2007
03:00:32,067 --> 03:00:33,978
She stealing my child.

2008
03:00:34,300 --> 03:00:39,010
- I can't believe...
- She threatening the law if I make a fuss.

2009
03:00:43,334 --> 03:00:45,314
What can I do?

2010
03:00:47,167 --> 03:00:48,840
Ain't nothing you can do.

2011
03:00:50,601 --> 03:00:52,080
She white and you black.

2012
03:00:54,233 --> 03:00:57,237
And ain't nobody gonna believe you.
even ii what you say is true.

2013
03:00:59,333 --> 03:01:02,212
It true all light.

2014
03:01:03,967 --> 03:01:05,969
I'm sure you just imagining things.

2015
03:01:06,434 --> 03:01:09,278
I'm sure Miss Mandy is doing it
all for the best.

2016
03:01:10,100 --> 03:01:12,546
And don't you go making no trouble.

2017
03:01:12,700 --> 03:01:15,806
Life's hard enough
for black folk around here.

2018
03:01:16,234 --> 03:01:17,941
That it?

2019
03:01:18,667 --> 03:01:20,772
She's stealing my child...

2020
03:01:20,934 --> 03:01:23,414
...and ain't nothing I can do...

2021
03:01:23,567 --> 03:01:25,569
...because I black.

2022
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,604
That's the way of the world, girl.

2023
03:01:36,200 --> 03:01:38,202
You go home.

2024
03:01:38,367 --> 03:01:40,608
Talk to Miss Mandy.

2025
03:01:41,834 --> 03:01:44,246
The world will look better in the morning.

2026
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:50,780
God bless you.

2027
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:11,307
What we must remember at all times...

2028
03:02:11,467 --> 03:02:13,845
...is the child's soul.

2029
03:02:14,833 --> 03:02:18,804
If what you say is true,
the woman is mentally affected.

2030
03:02:18,967 --> 03:02:22,176
Perhaps time in an institution
would be of help.

2031
03:02:22,334 --> 03:02:24,610
Then what would happen to Abner?

2032
03:02:24,767 --> 03:02:28,442
A suitable foster home
will have to be found.

2033
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:30,946
You give me my child!

2034
03:02:31,100 --> 03:02:33,580
Queen! How dale you!

2035
03:02:33,734 --> 03:02:36,010
Do you know your ledeemel. gill?

2036
03:02:36,167 --> 03:02:38,238
Yes. sir. I do.

2037
03:02:38,400 --> 03:02:39,640
