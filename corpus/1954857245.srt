1
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,480
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,148
No, it's me,
it's my fault.

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,116
I wasn't looking.

4
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,784
These things...

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,289
So, are you
staying in the hotel?

6
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,459
No. I'm here
for a meeting.

7
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,228
So am i.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,363
That's nice.

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,000
And I am
gonna be late.

10
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:39,538
This is the slowest elevator
in the world.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,774
No, thank you.
I'll wait.

12
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,243
Suit yourself.

13
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,677
Thank you.

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,820
Stairs.

15
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,369
Ahem. Lost?

16
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,237
Uh, kind of, yeah.

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,305
I'm trying
to remember where

18
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,706
the grand ballroom is.

19
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,974
That's
where I'm going.

20
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,043
Mind if I tag along?

21
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,879
Suit yourself.

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,982
Thanks.

23
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,017
So what's
your meeting about?

24
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,885
If you don't mind
me asking?

25
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:27,986
I am booking
the grand ballroom

26
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,188
for a wedding.

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,090
Oh.

28
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:32,491
Congratulations.

29
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:33,792
Thank you.

30
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,894
Oh! Not for me.
Um, for my clients.

31
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,963
I'm a wedding planner.

32
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,532
Really? Ah!
It's small world.

33
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:40,999
I'm an event planner.

34
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,134
Oh?

35
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,268
Yeah, you know,
corporate retreats,

36
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,070
trade shows,
that kind of thing.

37
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,338
- Sounds interesting.
- It is.

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,440
That big Melman computers
party last month,

39
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,709
where we turned the entire
park square center

40
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,311
into a giant zombie walk?

41
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,812
That was me.

42
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,380
Wow.

43
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,949
Ms. summers!

44
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,917
Hello! Nice
to see you again.

45
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,719
- Hi, Mr. Kwon.
- Kenny!

46
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,753
Mr. Parker!

47
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,988
Good to see you.

48
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,156
Yeah! You too.

49
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,391
Uh, do you know each other?

50
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,526
Yeah, we--

51
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,994
No. And I don't want
to interrupt all this,

52
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,796
but I have the final check
for the 29th.

53
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,830
- Right here.
- Thank you.

54
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:12,931
Wait, wait, wait.
The 29th?

55
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,899
Like, next Saturday,
the 29th?

56
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,200
That's right.

57
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,602
That's when
I wanted to book it.

58
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,170
Oh, I'm sorry, but...

59
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:21,273
Wait. You're trying to book
a place for next week,<i> now?</i>

60
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,743
Yeah, one of my regular clients
called with a last-minute thing,

61
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:28,213
500 hundred car execs
need a place to party,

62
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,482
and this-- this
would be perfect.

63
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,683
I wish I could help you,

64
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,619
but I booked this room
six months ago.

65
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,020
Do you really need
this much space

66
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,255
for a wedding?

67
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,956
Kenny, why don't
you show her

68
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,957
one of the other
ballrooms?

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,225
Excuse me?

70
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,728
Well, the regent room

71
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,362
is smaller, but it's
certainly beautiful,

72
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,296
and the view...

73
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,465
And I will kick in

74
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,100
10% of the rental fee.

75
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,034
What?

76
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,270
15? What do you say?

77
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:53,372
I say that a deal
is a deal, Mr. Kwon,

78
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,207
no matter how many
people are in the party.

79
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,341
I'll see you
on Saturday.

80
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,809
Nice to meet you.

81
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,447
Happy wedding!

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,288
Do you believe in love?

83
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,056
<i>Of course you do.</i>

84
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,358
<i>That's why
you're getting married.</i>

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,527
<i>And that's why I'm here.</i>

86
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,529
<i>My name is Jessica summers,</i>

87
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,532
<i>and I'd like to help you plan
the most important day--</i>

88
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,101
- Mom, I'm home!
<i>- ...Of your life.</i>

89
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,203
I'll be right there, honey!

90
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,418
The new website design
looks great.

91
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,820
We've had 100 hits since
we went online this morning.

92
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,190
Nice, mom. See what I
got from the library?

93
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,526
Original director's cut of
"Kansas City confidential."

94
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,961
Digitally restored.

95
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,196
You and your old movies.

96
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,764
They're not old, mom...

97
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,733
They're<i> classic.</i>

98
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,368
How was your day?

99
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,936
Good!

100
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,739
Except for this guy who tried
to weasel me out of a venue

101
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,407
that I booked six months
ago.

102
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,742
What happened?

103
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,277
Your mother prevailed.

104
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,247
And he, hopefully, went back
to event planning school.

105
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,681
How was your day?

106
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,850
Well...

107
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,085
We got our grades back

108
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,953
on that math test
from yesterday.

109
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,255
How'd you do?

110
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,591
You might want to sit down.

111
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,792
Mrs. dowd
is a pretty tough grader,

112
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,561
I'm sure you did your best.

113
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,198
96? You got 96%?

114
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,466
Would've been 97

115
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,301
if I hadn't left out
the decimal point

116
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,969
on the last question.

117
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,904
This is amazing!
Congratulations!

118
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,640
- Thanks, mom.
- I'm so proud of you!

119
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:37,009
Are you really?

120
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,910
What kind of question
is that?

121
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:39,978
Of course I am!

122
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,480
You're my hero.
You know that.

123
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,385
Yes, mom?

124
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,986
What is that?

125
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,254
What is what?

126
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,223
That.

127
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,658
Oh!

128
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,359
That!

129
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,028
I made it for you in class.

130
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,462
You did?

131
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,197
Sweetie, I love it,

132
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,632
but we don't have a dog.

133
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,868
Yeah.

134
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,836
About that, mom...

135
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,071
Luke.

136
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:06,972
Come on, mom.

137
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,940
I got 96% in math!

138
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,177
That's gotta be worth
at least a chihuahua.

139
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,745
Sweetie, we've
talked about this.

140
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,314
I know, but...

141
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,516
What do you have
against dogs anyway?

142
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,185
Nothing! I love dogs.

143
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,887
You know I love dogs.

144
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,823
But you have school
and basketball and homework,

145
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:29,127
and I've got a house
and a business and you.

146
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,398
We just don't have time
in our schedule for a dog.

147
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,334
Now go get cleaned up.
I made your favorite.

148
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,469
Mac-and-cheese casserole.

149
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,870
Good guess!

150
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,407
I don't have to guess, mom.
It's Tuesday night.

151
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,776
We always have
Mac-and-cheese casserole

152
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,912
on Tuesday night.

153
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,948
It's "on our schedule."

154
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,727
Jessica summers
wedding designs.

155
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:02,894
Jessica speaking.

156
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,201
Jessica!

157
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,002
Please come in.

158
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,404
You must be Gabby.

159
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,507
Guilty!

160
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,009
Oh, we have heard

161
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,879
the nicest things
about you,

162
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,714
and we just love
your website

163
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,982
and your blog.

164
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,851
Thank you.

165
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,252
My son, Paul,

166
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,554
when he heard the word
"wedding plan,"

167
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,523
he went a bit bonkers.

168
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,358
And he just doesn't want
to have a big fuss,

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,926
he likes to keep things
simple.

170
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,094
And--

171
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,330
...have some good food
and some music,

172
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:39,531
and call it a day.

173
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,500
Because it's not
just "a day", Paul.

174
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,368
It's our wedding day!

175
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,370
I didn't wait my whole life
just to get married

176
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,306
in someone's
backyard.

177
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,008
Not that it isn't
a beautiful...

178
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,910
No offense, Gabby.

179
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,845
No offense taken.

180
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,280
Paul and Lucy,

181
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,150
I would like you
to meet Jessica summers.

182
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,985
The wedding planner.

183
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,720
I can't believe
you're here.

184
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,321
I just hope I can help.

185
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,490
Paul, remember
we saw her on TV?

186
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,992
Isn't this the best?

187
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,127
Yeah. The best.

188
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,228
Nice to meet you.

189
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,297
Okay.

190
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,765
Let's get you married.

191
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,200
Yes!

192
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,601
This is one of my favorites.

193
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,171
We did a black-and-white
winter wedding

194
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,372
with a fairy-tale theme,

195
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,240
sort of heavy
on the "Princess" concept.

196
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,341
Princess?

197
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,409
Oh, Paul,
did you hear that?

198
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,546
Yeah. Princess.
It's great.

199
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,782
You know, with the budget
you have in mind,

200
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,451
we can create almost
anything,

201
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,620
but first, we need to determine
what you really want.

202
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,722
It's your day.

203
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,258
Okay... so...

204
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,194
I've always
wanted a pink wedding.

205
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,096
You know, with lots of
different shades of pink,

206
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,765
and pink flowers,

207
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:52,237
and maybe little white
lights everywhere--

208
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,674
And Paul, your tux could
have a pink cummerbund

209
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,375
and a matching
bow tie--

210
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:01,179
Whoa. I-i-- I'm not
wearing a pink bow tie.

211
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,982
But, Paul...

212
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,417
No.

213
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,021
You know, Paul...

214
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,723
I get it.

215
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,391
I do.

216
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:17,262
You asked the woman you love
a simple question,

217
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,997
"will you marry me?"

218
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,732
And then this whole
tidal wave hits you--

219
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,834
Family and friends
and invitations

220
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,903
and flowers and tulle.

221
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,571
And Lucy...

222
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,074
You've probably
been dreaming of this day

223
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,909
your whole life.

224
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,478
And you don't understand
why Paul isn't as excited

225
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,313
as you are
about all the details.

226
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,416
You're not alone, okay?

227
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,186
I've planned over 100 weddings
and in each one of them,

228
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,921
there's been some sort of
minor disagreement

229
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,689
between the bride and groom.

230
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,192
But I haven't lost one
couple.

231
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,328
Each and every one of them
made it to the altar.

232
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:59,397
And so will you.

233
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,543
Anybody home?

234
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,777
In here!

235
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,579
- Is that Adam?
- Yeah!

236
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,681
He's good
at this sort of stuff.

237
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,716
I thought maybe he can give us
a hand figuring out numbers--

238
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,951
You know, how much food to
buy, that kind of thing.

239
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,053
Paul, we already have
a wedding planner.

240
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,922
I know, I know.
I just thought

241
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,356
I'd like to
have him around

242
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,892
to make sure things
don't get too...

243
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,227
Pink.

244
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,628
There's
the blushing bride!

245
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,863
Uh, Jessica,

246
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:28,466
I would like you to meet
my nephew, Adam Parker.

247
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,201
Adam... Jessica.

248
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,039
The wedding planner.

249
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,707
Hello.

250
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,009
You two know each other?

251
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,879
We've met.

252
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,747
Yes. It's a small world.

253
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,215
Great!

254
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,152
Then you guys wouldn't
mind working together.

255
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,456
Right?

256
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,294
Oh, I--
I am so sorry.

257
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,497
I had no idea my son was
going to spring this on us.

258
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,066
Not a problem.

259
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,068
I'll sure Adam
will be very helpful.

260
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,670
Yes, I-I'm sure
he'll do his best, but...

261
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,906
He's not a wedding planner,
you know.

262
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,774
Is there anything

263
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,677
I can say to make you
reverse your decision

264
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,879
and help us with the
wedding?

265
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,015
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid not.

266
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,218
Well, if you ever
change your mind,

267
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,419
please let me know?

268
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,988
Of course.

269
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,124
Good luck with everything.

270
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,093
And if I could give you
a little advice?

271
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:32,897
Make sure Adam books the venue
more than a week in advance.

272
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,843
Okay, so, I'm sort of
thinking

273
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,778
we could put a big screen TV
on one end,

274
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,247
with huge speakers
on either side,

275
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,418
and roaming video cameras,
like a reality show.

276
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,586
Sweet!

277
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,287
Right?

278
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,757
Gonna be his-and-hers
dartboards...

279
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,125
Uh-huh...

280
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:04,262
- You got your football helmet?
- Yeah.

281
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,864
Did you see
that last hoop I sunk?

282
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,967
There wasn't even a sound,
it was like-- "swoosh."

283
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,835
It was amazing,
like you.

284
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,204
It wasn't just me, mom.
I've got a great team.

285
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,106
And I've got a great kid.

286
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,878
Thanks for coming.

287
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,047
Have I ever missed
a single one of your games?

288
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,148
No.

289
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,716
And I never will.
That's a promise.

290
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,386
How's the new
wedding going?

291
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,821
Oh, I'm not
doing that wedding.

292
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,389
Why?

293
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,691
Remember that guy
I told you about,

294
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,692
the one who tried

295
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,926
to steal the hotel
out from under me?

296
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,294
The weasel?

297
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,596
Turns out he's
the cousin of the groom.

298
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,266
So he can do
the wedding without me.

299
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,909
Jessica summers
wedding designs.

300
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,910
Jessica speaking.

301
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,011
<i>Hello, Jessica, dear!</i>

302
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,546
This is Gabby Taylor.

303
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,382
<i>Oh. Hi, Gabby.
How can I help you?</i>

304
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,117
Well...

305
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,353
To tell you the truth, this
is just a little bit awkward,

306
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,890
but I'm actually calling
for my nephew, Adam.

307
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,126
Okay...

308
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,594
This whole
wedding-planner thing

309
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:13,631
is a little bit out of
his comfort zone, so...

310
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,668
He was wondering if you could
meet him tomorrow for a coffee,

311
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,737
so that he could
pick your brain.

312
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,371
<i>Gabby, I, uh...</i>

313
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,707
I don't think I should
get involved in this.

314
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,310
I mean, you know, Paul wants
his cousin to do the wedding,

315
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,512
which I completely
understand, but--

316
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,247
Oh, but this isn't
about Paul.

317
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,982
I'm really concerned
about Lucy.

318
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:34,419
I just don't want her
to get lost in the shuffle.

319
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,288
<i>Her parents won't get here until
right before the wedding,</i>

320
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,591
<i>and I want to take care of her
just like her mother would.</i>

321
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,694
Um, well, I guess I could give
her one of my bridal books,

322
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:43,762
<i>if it would help?</i>

323
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,497
Um, honestly, what would
help

324
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,466
is if you could sit down
with Adam

325
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,035
and talk him
through the process.

326
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,837
I don't know...

327
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,340
I shouldn't be
telling you this, but...

328
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:59,010
Adam came to me
on bended knee.

329
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,514
He was literally begging me
to have you help.

330
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,652
Just a little cup of coffee?

331
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:11,256
Gabby, can you hang on
just a minute, please?

332
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,991
- Luke, it's business.
- I know, mom!

333
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,359
Is this the wedding
you were talking about,

334
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,660
the one with the weasel?

335
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,328
Don't say "the weasel,"
his name is Adam.

336
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,834
Okay. So the groom
has Adam on his team, right?

337
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,402
In a way, I guess.

338
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,404
Well, what about
the bride?

339
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,040
Who's gonna be
on her team?

340
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,580
♪ Dear future husband ♪

341
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,249
♪ Here's a few things
you'll need to know ♪

342
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:42,754
♪ If you want to be my one

343
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,292
I am so sorry.

344
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,693
There was a huge line
at the passport office,

345
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,297
and there was babies crying
and some guy passed out.

346
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,499
It was a mess.

347
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,001
Well, but you're
here now, so.

348
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,437
And I need some of this.

349
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,975
Hi.

350
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,311
I'd like a large two-pump,
sugar-free vanilla-soy,

351
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:09,047
no foam, fair trade,
dark roast latte.

352
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,718
I'll have a small coffee.
Black.

353
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,987
Wow. Taking a walk
on the wild side, huh?

354
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,523
So the passport
office, huh?

355
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,791
Where're you going?

356
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:23,161
I'm not
exactly sure yet.

357
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,696
What do you mean?

358
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,631
Well, every year
on my birthday,

359
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,733
I throw a dart
at this map on the wall,

360
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,868
and wherever
that dart lands,

361
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,369
the next day,
I got to go there.

362
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,937
- Seriously?
- Uh-huh.

363
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,139
You mean, you don't plan it
or anything,

364
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,008
you just go
wherever the dart goes?

365
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,042
Sure. Why not?

366
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,979
Because
it's weird and random.

367
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,347
Exactly.

368
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,915
That's why I gotta keep
the old passport up-to-date.

369
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,683
Last year was Bhutan.

370
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,719
Incredible.
What about you?

371
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,520
Do you like to travel?

372
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,090
I'd like to,
but with Luke in school,

373
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,259
that's my son,
he's in sixth grade,

374
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,493
and my business,

375
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,495
there's just
not enough time.

376
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,031
That is what I love
about event planning.

377
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,033
You get the job,
you set it up,

378
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,269
do the event,
and boom--

379
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,704
Out the door,
and you're done.

380
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,308
I frees me up
to do whatever I want,

381
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,076
go wherever I want.

382
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,745
I am not gonna be
one of those people

383
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,813
who end up 80 years old

384
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,715
with nothing to show
for their life.

385
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,850
You know?

386
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,818
I don't really think of
my son as "nothing."

387
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,354
What? No!
Oh, my god, no.

388
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,023
I'm so--
Okay, wow.

389
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,791
That is not
what I meant.

390
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,060
I'm really doing
well today, huh?

391
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,561
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

392
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,430
So, no wife, no girlfriend?

393
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,699
Nah, never really had
time for that.

394
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,367
But you had time for Bhutan?

395
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,570
What about you?

396
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,705
You married?

397
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,173
I was.

398
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,508
That was a long time ago.

399
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,312
And now I have
my business and my son.

400
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,380
So, no boyfriend?

401
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,116
Don't really have time
for that either.

402
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:56,187
So, what kinds of things did
you want to ask me about?

403
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,488
What?

404
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,723
You wanted to meet for
coffee,

405
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,091
to talk about
Paul and Lucy's wedding.

406
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,092
Where should we start?

407
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,561
I wanted to meet you?

408
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,363
Didn't you?

409
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,299
No. Aunt Gabby called me and
said you wanted to meet me,

410
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,969
and get some tips on expanding
your business model

411
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,337
- ...or something.
- My business model?

412
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,808
Yeah, like learn more
about event planning and...

413
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,876
We've been set up.

414
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,014
Your aunt must be desperate
to get us to work together

415
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,115
on this wedding.

416
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:27,018
Paul and Lucy
are a great couple.

417
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,686
They deserve a great
wedding.

418
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,054
You think you can do it?

419
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,889
Well, Paul wants me to...

420
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:35,493
But I don't have
the experience that you do.

421
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,195
To be honest,

422
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,930
I could really use your
help.

423
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,837
If we<i> were</i> to work
together--

424
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,838
Okay.

425
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,039
"If."

426
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,974
We would have to present
a united front

427
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,209
to the bride and groom.

428
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,810
Absolutely.

429
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:55,179
You make all the decisions.
I'll be a silent partner.

430
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,115
I'll just go along
with anything you say.

431
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,584
What do you think?

432
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,619
Should we give it a shot?

433
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,296
Jessica! Adam.

434
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,931
What a lovely surprise!

435
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,000
Seriously, aunt Gabby?

436
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,835
Which one of us
did you call first?

437
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,739
Well, let's not
dwell on the past.

438
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,875
Come on in!

439
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,816
Chicken wings?

440
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,419
Yeah, but they're gonna be
in a nice silver dish.

441
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,620
Kids!

442
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,022
I have a surprise
for you.

443
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,591
Your new wedding planners.

444
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,332
June is just around the
your new wcorner, planners.

445
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,268
So we already have
a pretty short lead time,

446
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,569
but if we're organized,

447
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,138
we should be able to
get you everything you want.

448
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,540
Agreed!

449
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,241
Thank you.

450
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,578
So, let's start
with the big picture first.

451
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,712
The size of the event.

452
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:02,880
Big or small?

453
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,248
Small.

454
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,450
Uh,<i> big.</i>

455
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,251
Okay, let's put a pin
in that one

456
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,553
and move on to something
else.

457
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,588
What degree of formality
would you like?

458
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,090
Not?

459
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,393
Well... let's be
more specific.

460
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,029
There's ultra-formal, formal,
semi-formal, and informal.

461
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,631
I would like it to be
formal.

462
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,800
Yeah, but not too formal.

463
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,902
What if we compromised?

464
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,737
I mean, I'm just riffing
here,

465
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:30,741
but what about a big barbecue,
and Jessica dresses it up?

466
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,112
I know this place
where we can get

467
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,515
and I'm thinking maybe
black-tie for the waiters?

468
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,450
I kind of like
that idea!

469
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,686
Darling,
this is a wedding...

470
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,755
Not a monster
truck rally.

471
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,557
Next idea?

472
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,728
I was thinking maybe
a modern, vintage style.

473
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,130
Hawaiian barbecue!

474
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,431
Tiki torches!

475
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,233
Okay, let's put a pin
in that one, too,

476
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,602
and move on to the ceremony.

477
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,237
I was hoping
we could do it

478
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,204
where you and dad
got married?

479
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,272
Forget it.

480
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,840
They turned it
into condos.

481
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,309
Besides,
it was cursed.

482
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,345
Why do you have to have
two places?

483
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,679
What do you mean?

484
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,181
Why can't you have
the wedding

485
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,016
and the reception
at the same venue?

486
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,851
Much more cost-effective,

487
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,319
and that way, your guests don't
have to try to find parking

488
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,954
twice in the same day.

489
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,823
What do you guys think?

490
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,124
Yeah.

491
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,593
Okay, sold.

492
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,062
Yes! One point for me.

493
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,931
We're not keeping score,
Adam.

494
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,900
It's a wedding,
not a competition.

495
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,136
So who's going to officiate?

496
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,804
I got it.

497
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,874
I know exactly where
we're gonna do this!

498
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:37,875
Where?

499
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,777
Northwood
athletic center.

500
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,379
Whoa...

501
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,549
"The northwood
athletic center?"

502
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,284
Paul, I don't know
what that is.

503
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,519
It's where the football team
holds its spring training.

504
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,521
It would be amazing.

505
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,957
The center is right by a
lake, we could set up tents.

506
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,792
I did this event there
last year.

507
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,327
We could call the guy
up and I know we--

508
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,628
You're suggesting

509
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,764
we have Paul and Lucy's wedding
at a football stadium?

510
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,868
Lots of parking?

511
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,804
Would you all excuse me
for a minute, please?

512
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,806
Adam, may I please
speak with you outside?

513
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,616
What happened
to our "united front"?

514
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,884
I thought you were
gonna follow my lead.

515
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,553
I'm sorry. I got
a little carried away.

516
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,754
A little?

517
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:24,822
We're supposed to be
planning a wedding,

518
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:25,856
not the super bowl.

519
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,325
I know, but I thought
we were losing Paul,

520
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,193
and I wanted
to throw him a bone.

521
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:32,163
Besides, the athletic center
is kind of incredible.

522
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:33,764
My clients loved it.

523
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,934
What clients?

524
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,302
They have the largest
fishing competition

525
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,238
in the entire
pacific northwest.

526
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,806
Look.

527
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,909
Adam, I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

528
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:45,910
I really do!

529
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,245
But here's the thing.

530
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,547
I believe that every wedding

531
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,451
is an opportunity to bring
two people together.

532
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,821
It's not always easy,
but I think it's worth it.

533
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,156
And I think we need to use
my experience

534
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:02,593
to guide
Paul and Lucy together.

535
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,267
Everything all right
out here?

536
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,535
It's great.

537
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,604
- Everything's fine.
- Good.

538
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,007
About
the football stadium...

539
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,708
I--<i> we...</i>

540
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,177
don't think
it's gonna work.

541
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,512
Oh?

542
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,080
Yeah, it's just not really

543
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,182
the right venue
for this kind of even--

544
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,183
Wedding.

545
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,818
But don't worry.

546
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,453
We have some other
wonderful ideas.

547
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,889
And we are going to go
and find the perfect place

548
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,292
for Paul and Lucy
to tie the old knot.

549
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,426
We'd better get going.

550
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:38,296
We've got
a wedding to plan.

551
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,903
Okay, I think you're
going to like this one.

552
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:49,507
It's got everything we need
for a perfect wedding.

553
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,377
It's great, isn't it?

554
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,013
Lots of room for curtains
and lights.

555
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,449
Easy access to parking
over here,

556
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,318
so the trucks
can load and unload.

557
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,386
Oh, and check this out
over here--

558
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,255
This is the best part.

559
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,424
Look at how close it is
to the bathrooms.

560
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,628
So what do you think?

561
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,600
Is that a no?

562
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,302
You have to start
thinking about

563
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,938
what would make
for a perfect wedding venue.

564
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,841
I thought I had.

565
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,576
So, what do you think?

566
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:28,846
I think Paul would run
screaming from this place.

567
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,114
Oh, come on!

568
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,949
How could anybody
not love it?

569
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,451
It's got charm,
it's got history,

570
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,852
but most importantly,

571
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,923
it's got "romance"
written all over it.

572
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:39,924
Where?

573
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,559
Tsk!

574
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:42,593
Do you know how many
weddings they've had here?

575
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,761
That kind of thing

576
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:46,063
has real symbolic
weight for people.

577
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,100
Maybe if people
put as much time

578
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,435
and thought into their marriages
as they did their weddings,

579
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:52,837
there wouldn't be
so many divorces.

580
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,805
There's nothing
I can do about that.

581
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,307
But what I can do

582
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:00,144
is give them one
perfect, memorable day,

583
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,846
and get them started out
right.

584
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,147
And for that,

585
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,816
I need
a romantic setting.

586
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,919
Oh, you want
a romantic setting?

587
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,922
Come with me.

588
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,694
Can I
ask you a question?

589
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,162
Shoot.

590
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,897
Have you got something
against weddings?

591
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,065
Why?

592
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,267
I don't know,
just a feeling I get.

593
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:27,037
Nothing against them,
per se, but...

594
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,407
I mean, why do you need
a contract for love?

595
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,275
If you want to be
with someone,

596
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,343
then you be with them,
and when you don't,

597
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:35,513
you can both
just walk away.

598
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,581
Out the door.
Done.

599
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,517
It's just more practical.

600
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,219
Okay, but forget
about the legal stuff.

601
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,388
There's something
very powerful

602
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,523
about two people

603
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,425
standing in front
of their community,

604
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,127
declaring their love
for each other.

605
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,662
I just think

606
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,298
it's a really beautiful,
important thing

607
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,033
in a couple's life.

608
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,568
Okay.

609
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,638
Well, if you don't
mind me asking--

610
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,208
What happened
to my marriage?

611
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,745
Too personal?
I'm sorry.

612
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:09,847
No, it's okay.

613
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,450
We're still
friends, but...

614
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,919
Let's just say
the man I married

615
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,353
wasn't the husband
or father

616
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,621
I thought he'd be.

617
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,223
But you're
a wedding planner.

618
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,825
I mean,
it's kind of ironic.

619
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,860
Not really.

620
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,862
Just because I made
one bad decision

621
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,398
doesn't mean I can't
still believe in love.

622
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,968
And I definitely still
believe in marriage.

623
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,904
So why haven't
you remarried?

624
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,573
Because. Right now,

625
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:36,807
I'm raising the most
important person

626
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,309
in the world to me.

627
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,712
And between Luke
and my business, well...

628
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,747
That's all I need.

629
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,250
See, I don't think
that's completely true.

630
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,985
I think you could use

631
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,620
some more adventure
in your life.

632
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,822
Well, if I don't have
a wedding booked,

633
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,990
Luke and I go out for pizza
and a movie

634
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,259
the first Saturday
of every month.

635
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,595
That's all
the adventure I need.

636
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,730
That's
not adventure.

637
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,071
This... is adventure.

638
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,612
Wow.

639
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,280
This is beautiful.

640
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:19,750
Isn't it?

641
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,018
Paul would love it.

642
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,253
I bet Lucy would, too.

643
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:23,687
Here, turn around.

644
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,055
Oh!

645
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,658
Nice.

646
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,827
Wait...

647
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,362
You mean
for the wedding?

648
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,429
Yeah!

649
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:33,831
We could set up tables
over here,

650
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:34,999
run some lights.

651
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:36,500
Build a platform

652
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:37,635
for the minister
to do the ceremony.

653
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,169
How are people
supposed to get here?

654
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,005
Like we did. Hike.

655
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,908
An entire wedding party?

656
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,075
In tuxedos.

657
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,677
And a bride
in a wedding dress?

658
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,846
She could lift it up
when she walks.

659
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,648
You know, I really
thought we were

660
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,117
communicating here.

661
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,318
You don't like it?

662
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,687
No! I love it.
I love it!

663
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,689
It's incredible,
but not for a wedding.

664
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:02,459
Huh! I didn't realize you'd
be so closed to new ideas.

665
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,929
Not "new." Bad.

666
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,397
That's just in your opinion.

667
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,533
Well, in this case,
it's my opinion that counts.

668
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,036
You know, you clearly don't get
the entire concept of romance.

669
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:13,637
What makes you the expert?

670
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,439
The only man in your life
is your 10-year-old kid.

671
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,608
Just because I don't have
time for a relationship

672
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,510
doesn't mean I don't
understand romance.

673
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:22,646
Don't have time,
or just gave up?

674
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,649
I'm not taking
relationship advice

675
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:28,185
from a guy who can't even
commit to a vacation spot

676
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,920
without throwing
a dart at a map!

677
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,288
You're making this
a lot more difficult

678
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,389
than it has to be.

679
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,624
Because it's important!

680
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,526
And if you don't
understand that now,

681
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:38,062
you probably never will.
Let's go.

682
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,597
Where?

683
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,732
Sleeping beauty's castle?

684
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,435
Rockefeller center?

685
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,235
The white house?

686
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,871
No! I'm going home!

687
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,173
You've obviously
got this covered,

688
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:52,276
so, from here on in,
you're on your own.

689
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,979
I drove!

690
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,814
Argh!

691
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,037
So how goes the planning
with you and Jessica?

692
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,505
Well.

693
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,740
We've hit a few bumps,
but...

694
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,977
don't worry.
It's gonna be great.

695
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,379
This whole thing's
getting out of control.

696
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,748
Lucy wants this,
my mom wants that,

697
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,016
I want something else.

698
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,585
You getting cold feet?

699
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,788
Nah, it's nothing like that.
It's...

700
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:14,458
It's just a lot to take in,
that's all.

701
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,960
Yeah.

702
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,629
So why do it?

703
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,198
Huh?

704
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,135
Why get married?

705
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,138
Because there's no one
I'd rather be with.

706
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,408
No one I'd rather talk to,
come home to.

707
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,212
Yeah, but why the whole
wedding dog-and-pony show?

708
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,214
What's the big deal
about getting up there

709
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:42,186
in front of a bunch of people
and saying some words?

710
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,289
Because I'm going to be
saying those words to Lucy.

711
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,257
Because I love her.

712
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,126
And I want
the whole world to know.

713
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,339
<i>You're sorry?</i>

714
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,907
I love this part.
Watch this.

715
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,510
Thanks!

716
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:09,079
For nothing.

717
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,280
Mom?

718
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,382
Mom!

719
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,218
Yeah, honey,
it's almost ready.

720
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,087
Uh... okay.

721
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,056
Let me ask you a question.

722
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,859
Do you think we have enough
adventure in our lives?

723
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,293
Adventure?

724
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,729
Yeah, you know,
fun stuff, crazy--

725
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,965
Out of the ordinary
that kind of thing.

726
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,768
We go to the movies
and have pizza.

727
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,636
Yeah, but is that
really "adventure"?

728
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:37,274
Mom, I have school,
homework,

729
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,777
and the basketball
regional finals

730
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,145
coming up next month.

731
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,313
You have your own business.

732
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,550
Adventure isn't really
on our schedule.

733
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,819
Don't worry about it.

734
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,822
I've got practice today,
but I won't be late.

735
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:54,124
I'll come pick you up.

736
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,627
What about the wedding
with the weasel?

737
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,061
I mean, "Adam."

738
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,998
That turned out to be
a little more work

739
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,332
than I bargained for.

740
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,834
I've left it all
up to him.

741
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,469
Wow.

742
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:09,239
You've... you've never
quit a wedding before.

743
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,841
The guy must've
really got to you.

744
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,709
He did not "get" to me.

745
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,179
I just prefer
to work alone is all.

746
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,213
Where's my phone?

747
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:18,982
Didn't get to you.

748
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,151
Right.

749
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,720
Thanks.

750
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:26,323
Ahem. Jessica summers
wedding designs.

751
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,691
Jessica speaking.

752
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,560
Hey, it's Adam.

753
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:32,329
Oh. Hello, Adam.

754
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,064
What can I do for you?

755
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,668
I wanted to apologize to you,
but I need to do it in person.

756
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,838
That's all right,
don't worry about it.

757
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,539
Please?

758
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,975
Okay, fine.

759
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,844
Um, where are you?

760
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,580
I am right outside
your front door.

761
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,885
Hi.

762
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,520
Hey.

763
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,988
You must be Luke.

764
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,957
You must be the...

765
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:00,991
Adam.

766
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,060
You play basketball?

767
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,762
No. I just
carry it around,

768
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:06,763
for show.

769
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,131
You play?

770
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,467
Two-time state champion
in college.

771
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:13,136
College
was a long time ago.

772
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,972
Smart guy.

773
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,673
Luke, honey,
you're going to be late.

774
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,575
See you later.
Mom!

775
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,246
These are for you.

776
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,182
I'm sorry.

777
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,550
Adam, you didn't have to--

778
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,818
There are 15 of them.

779
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,419
Apology roses?

780
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,289
How did you know that?

781
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,091
I looked it up on the
Internet.

782
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,795
They're beautiful.

783
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,498
Thank you.

784
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,437
Come on in.

785
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,843
See, that's
the thing about me.

786
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:54,444
I know when
I know something,

787
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,346
and I know
when I don't.

788
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,148
Well, that's important.

789
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,317
And that's why I'm here.

790
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,420
I want
to make this work,

791
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,554
for Paul and Lucy,

792
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,422
for aunt Gabby...

793
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,292
For me.

794
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,594
I want to learn,

795
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,664
but I only learn
from the best.

796
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,935
And that's you.

797
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,974
We start with a vision
board.

798
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,009
Isn't that
a native American thing?

799
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,779
That's a "vision quest."

800
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,681
All right.
As we make decisions,

801
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:32,883
and Lucy and Paul
make choices,

802
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:34,818
we'll post them on this
board-- everything from

803
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,621
the wedding's color palette
to the invitations.

804
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,022
I do all
my invites online.

805
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,891
It's fast
and efficient,

806
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,159
and saves trees.

807
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,894
It's also
completely temporary.

808
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,829
You can't put an email
in a scrapbook.

809
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,397
Here.

810
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,400
Feel this.

811
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,803
It's nice...

812
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,071
Mm.

813
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,172
Expensive.

814
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:56,373
Well, it's
more than that.

815
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,241
It's a part of
the experience I love.

816
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,810
And they make

817
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,945
for a lovely souvenir
that you can keep forever.

818
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:06,216
Don't you think that's, like,
a little old-fashioned?

819
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,452
Not entirely.
Guests can rsvp online.

820
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,519
And you should
actually start

821
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,520
helping Paul and Lucy

822
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,521
work on their
wedding website.

823
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:12,689
What is that for?

824
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,291
That...

825
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,393
Is to keep
guests updated

826
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:17,828
and give friends
and family

827
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,463
a place where
they can share thoughts

828
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:20,998
and memories
of the happy couple.

829
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,934
You know, I never
thought of that either.

830
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,836
Huh! Now who's
being old-fashioned?

831
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,672
So working backwards
from the wedding date,

832
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,508
everything has to
be calendared.

833
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,643
Wait.
That's a verb?

834
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,078
The most important one

835
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,380
in the wedding business--
It's how we know

836
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,148
when to book the vendors--
The caterers, florists,

837
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,383
photographers,
videographers.

838
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,718
I have some of the best
vendors in town.

839
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,820
Have they ever done a
wedding?

840
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,022
I don't know,

841
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,857
but they satisfied
a fortune 500 company,

842
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,092
so, pretty sure they can
handle a bride and groom.

843
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,694
Mm. I wouldn't count on it.

844
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,262
It's better to stick with
experienced professionals,

845
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:53,964
people you know.

846
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:57,534
No room for adventure
in a wedding, huh?

847
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,170
You'd be surprised.

848
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:04,674
Um, you always have to
prepare for the unexpected.

849
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,144
So the next thing we need
to consider is the cake.

850
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:10,414
I have
a fantastic cake guy.

851
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:13,216
He made an exact replica
of the 1968 Ford mustang

852
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,118
that Steve McQueen
drove in<i> bullitt.</i>

853
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,288
Fed 300 people.

854
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:26,290
That sounds just
perfect for a wedding.

855
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,335
Ahem.

856
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:35,806
Jessica summers wedding designs.
Jessica speaking.

857
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,774
<i>Jessica, dear!
It's Gabby.</i>

858
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,976
How are things going?

859
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,678
Oh, yeah,
things are going--

860
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,946
...Fine.

861
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,682
Um, everything's
totally under control.

862
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:46,783
Good.

863
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,985
I was just wondering
where we are

864
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,620
with choosing a venue.

865
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,689
I think it would go a long
way

866
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:56,293
towards reassuring Lucy
and my son.

867
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,396
We're on our way.

868
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,400
All right!

869
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:04,634
Come on.

870
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,337
Where are we going?

871
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,606
It's showtime.

872
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,780
It's over 200 years old,

873
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,682
and it's been the site
of hundreds of weddings,

874
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,517
including those of
crowned heads of state,

875
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,119
movie stars,
world leaders.

876
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,154
So? What do you think?

877
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,822
It is so adorable.

878
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,258
- It's beautiful.
- It looks old.

879
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,496
Well, that's kind of the
idea.

880
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,164
It's historic, honey.

881
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,334
Why do we have to
get married in a museum?

882
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,603
Why can't we get married
someplace cool?

883
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,738
How'd you feel
about a waterfall?

884
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,207
You know what
we should do?

885
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,042
We should put a pin
in this one as well,

886
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:48,078
and move on to something
that we can all agree on--

887
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,548
The cake.

888
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,018
Okay, Amy's put together a
lot of classic combinations

889
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,219
for you
to choose from.

890
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,821
Amy, take it away.

891
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,523
We've got
a banana cake

892
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,025
with chocolate
butter cream.

893
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:05,028
We've got coconut
with lime butter cream,

894
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,964
there's a lemon mousse
chiffon,

895
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,633
hazelnut meringue
black forest,

896
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,635
with cherry
jubilee filling.

897
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:15,105
Honey, try this one.

898
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,640
That's
a champagne cake.

899
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,775
Mm. It's interesting.

900
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,710
Do you want to join us?
There's cake.

901
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,279
Well--
Ah! He made it!

902
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,714
Sorry I'm late.

903
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,516
Had a little trouble
with my ganache.

904
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,153
Everybody, this is Burt.

905
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,888
He's an old friend of mine,

906
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,990
and one of the best bakers
in the northwest.

907
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,258
It's good.

908
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Uh, present company
excluded.

909
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,829
Nice to meet you, Burt.

910
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,998
What a lovely...
Surprise.

911
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,333
I've asked Burt
to bring us

912
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,435
something
a little outside the box.

913
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:49,539
We got chocolate cake
and chocolate ganache,

914
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:53,243
and a cream cheese
frosting.

915
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:56,680
And Dulce De leche
with a peanut butter cream.

916
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:58,048
What are you doing?

917
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,083
Eating. I'm eating.

918
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,252
No. What is Burt
doing here?

919
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:03,987
I wanted to bring
some adventure

920
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:04,854
to this wedding.

921
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,856
I thought
we talked about this.

922
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,225
We did,
but you didn't say no.

923
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:09,593
I also didn't say
you could hijack the cake.

924
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:10,794
You're hurting
Amy's feelings.

925
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:13,730
Mm! These are good!

926
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,067
I think I like
the champagne cake better.

927
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,401
Well, they're
all delicious,

928
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,804
but I thought Amy was
making the wedding cake.

929
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,307
It's okay, it's no problem.
I--

930
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,576
I just want
everybody to be happy.

931
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,878
Amy...

932
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,747
Is going to make
the wedding cake.

933
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,550
And Burt is going to
make the groom's cake.

934
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,487
Groom's cake?
No way!

935
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,689
Yeah. Paul, you let Lucy
pick the wedding cake,

936
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:42,592
and then you have any kind
of groom's cake you want.

937
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,628
And he can pick whatever
style he wants, right, Burt?

938
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,463
Yeah, sure!
I can do one

939
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,131
shaped like
a football stadium.

940
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,532
Yeah!

941
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,534
This is gonna be
the best wedding ever!

942
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,436
I'm Burt.

943
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,842
Nice save. Thanks.

944
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,144
If we're gonna be a team,

945
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,346
we have to watch
each other's backs.

946
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,248
That means
no more surprises.

947
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,349
Agreed?

948
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,518
Agreed.

949
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,722
Mm!

950
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,081
They all look so...
Formal.

951
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,649
They're supposed

952
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,151
to look formal.

953
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,218
They're tuxedos!

954
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,653
They're all supposed
to look like that.

955
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,189
Why can't we wear
something more casual, mom?

956
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,358
Something that's more like
me.

957
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,492
Honey, come on.

958
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,927
It's just
for one day.

959
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,729
Please?

960
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,331
For me?

961
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,435
How's it going?

962
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,370
About as well
as can be expected.

963
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,439
I think if your cousin
had his way,

964
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:04,474
he'd get married
in sweat pants

965
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:05,809
and a baseball cap.

966
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:08,611
I got this one.

967
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,318
Ladies.
Excuse us, please.

968
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,656
Paul... step
into my office.

969
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,995
Well, what do you think?

970
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:29,833
If anyone can convince
my son to do anything,

971
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:31,067
it's Adam.

972
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,106
Jessica?

973
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,041
May I ask a favor?

974
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,576
Of course.

975
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:41,378
My mom would love
to be here to help,

976
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,213
but she and my dad
won't be back from Europe

977
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,681
until a week before the
wedding.

978
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:47,484
I know this isn't something
wedding planners usually do,

979
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:51,187
but would you come look
at wedding dresses with me?

980
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:52,555
Gabby and I picked out
three.

981
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,991
I'd really like your opinion
before I choose.

982
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,860
Of course!
I'd be honored.

983
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:58,027
Thanks.

984
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,596
It would mean a lot to me.

985
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,264
Consider it done.

986
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,768
Ladies...

987
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,036
May I present to you...

988
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,638
The groom?

989
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,275
Wow.

990
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,945
Oh, my gosh...

991
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:21,384
I can't believe my little
boy is getting married.

992
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:22,986
He looks
so handsome.

993
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,890
Paul, you look...

994
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:30,560
I look pretty good.

995
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,601
I'm impressed.

996
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,537
How did you get him
to do that?

997
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,505
It was simple.

998
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:43,506
I just told him

999
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,707
what every guy
who puts on a tux

1000
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,042
wants to hear.

1001
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,610
What's that?

1002
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,246
"You look like James Bond."

1003
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,535
I feel like I've been
let into a secret society.

1004
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:13,970
I'm so glad
Lucy let you come.

1005
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,439
I wanted you to get
the full wedding experience.

1006
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,180
Wow.

1007
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,020
It's a classic silhouette.

1008
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,189
Timeless.

1009
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,624
It says "I don't care
about trends

1010
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,892
"or being cutting edge.

1011
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,927
I will never
go out of style."

1012
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,829
So in 30 years,

1013
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,164
when you're looking
at your wedding albums,

1014
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,866
you're not going,
"what was I thinking?"

1015
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,468
Exactly.

1016
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,204
Okay, let's see
the next one.

1017
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,109
Very dramatic.

1018
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,511
This is a statement dress.

1019
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,015
And what exactly
is it saying?

1020
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,917
"I'm confident,

1021
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:01,951
"assertive,

1022
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,188
and glamorous."

1023
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,090
Let's see the next one.

1024
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,609
What?

1025
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,077
No good?

1026
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,480
You look so beautiful.

1027
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:33,249
Really?

1028
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,752
Like a Princess.

1029
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,490
No, not a Princess.

1030
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:41,491
More like

1031
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:43,459
the most beautiful you

1032
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,028
you could ever be.

1033
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,796
Really?

1034
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,698
Really.

1035
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,401
This is the one.

1036
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,291
Hey, buddy.

1037
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,293
I'll take you out
in a minute.

1038
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,514
Mom!

1039
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:12,682
Kate's here!

1040
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,726
Fear in the night, seen it.

1041
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:25,728
Kansas City confidential,
seen it.

1042
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,664
Detour, seen it.

1043
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,365
D.O.A.? Yes!

1044
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:31,834
Your mom have
another wedding?

1045
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,003
Nope, my mom
has a date.

1046
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,338
I do not have a date.

1047
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,639
It's work.

1048
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:37,373
I'm just going to
sample some food

1049
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,441
for the Taylor wedding.

1050
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,475
Hi, Kate.

1051
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:40,543
Hi, Ms. summers.

1052
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:41,711
So, how do I look?

1053
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:43,980
Like you're
going on a date.

1054
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,249
I got it.

1055
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,316
Luke. Behave.

1056
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:50,053
Come on, mom, trust me.

1057
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,888
I won't be late.

1058
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,594
I always figured
you'd come back.

1059
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,396
- Good figuring.
- You here for the lady?

1060
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,065
I ain't here
for the mashed potatoes.

1061
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:02,932
Okay, that's enough.

1062
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,367
Bed by 9:00, and no soda.

1063
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,004
Wow.

1064
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:10,573
Treat her right, or you'll
be hearing from me.

1065
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:11,574
Be good for Katie.

1066
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:12,842
If I do,

1067
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:14,410
can we talk about
getting a dog?

1068
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:15,578
Good night.

1069
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,451
A dog?

1070
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:23,720
Yeah, he really
wants a dog.

1071
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,558
You look great.

1072
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,960
Thank you.

1073
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,195
You do too.

1074
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,196
Thank you.

1075
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:34,530
Uh, we'd better
hurry up.

1076
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,967
I promised sal
we'd be there at 7:00.

1077
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,536
Stay out as late as you
want!

1078
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,940
Yes!

1079
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,282
Enjoy.

1080
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,958
Jessica...

1081
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,161
How lovely
you look tonight.

1082
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:06,596
Thank you, sal.
This is Adam.

1083
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,097
You're a very
lucky man, Adam.

1084
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,932
No. No, I'm not--

1085
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,735
No, no, no, we're just
business partners, sal.

1086
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,070
Whatever you say.

1087
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,304
Come in the kitchen.

1088
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:16,986
I've prepared a few
special things for you.

1089
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,212
Sal, you didn't have
to do all this.

1090
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:24,514
My pleasure.

1091
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:26,048
You make yourself
comfortable,

1092
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,683
and we are
going to present you

1093
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:31,320
with some of
our very finest items,

1094
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:32,655
made just for you.

1095
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:33,556
Thank you.

1096
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:35,858
Man, it smells
amazing.

1097
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,127
We begin with mini-bruschetta
and crostini

1098
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,529
with 12 different
toppings.

1099
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,464
Wow.

1100
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,935
Mm.

1101
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,370
Try the smoked salmon
with asparagus.

1102
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:49,272
Try the crab with chili.

1103
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:50,640
Mm...

1104
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:53,876
And a little digestive aid

1105
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:56,112
on the house.

1106
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:58,548
Thank you.

1107
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,349
You know what would
be amazing after this?

1108
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,351
Some kind of hand-made pasta

1109
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,854
with a drizzle of olive oil,
and capers.

1110
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:06,389
And maybe we could have
a wood-burning pizza oven

1111
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:07,723
with made-to-order pizzas?

1112
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,525
And we could use
locally sourced ingredients,

1113
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:10,526
like gorgonzola--

1114
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:11,527
And pear?

1115
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:12,662
Yes, perfect!

1116
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,766
It's strange having
dinner conversation

1117
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:18,100
that doesn't
involve basketball

1118
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:19,101
or wanting a dog.

1119
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:21,237
I'll bet.

1120
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,472
It's nice.

1121
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,175
Can I ask you a question?

1122
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,244
Okay.

1123
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:30,379
Why did you become
a wedding planner?

1124
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,281
Oh, um...

1125
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:34,450
I liked the idea
of owning my own business.

1126
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:35,918
No, no, that's not what I
mean.

1127
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,888
I mean, we all do what we do
for different reasons,

1128
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,723
but there's always
that first step.

1129
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,392
What was yours?

1130
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,661
It's silly.

1131
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,064
Silly's okay.

1132
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,667
When I was a little girl,

1133
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:53,169
my parents had
their wedding picture

1134
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,737
framed on the piano.

1135
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,107
They looked so beautiful,

1136
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:02,545
the colors, the dresses,
and the flowers.

1137
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,180
I used to stare at that
picture

1138
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:07,149
and wish
I was in it.

1139
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:09,852
So I started planning
weddings.

1140
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:12,288
And after all my stuffed animals
had married each other,

1141
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,823
and the dolls
had married each other,

1142
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:15,725
and the neighbor's dog
married our cat...

1143
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:17,960
...it became pretty
clear to everyone

1144
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:19,195
that I was going to
do something

1145
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:21,464
in the matrimonial field.

1146
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:22,732
See?

1147
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:26,602
I told you there had to be
a first step somewhere.

1148
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:29,238
My parents have been married
for 46 years.

1149
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,773
Wow.

1150
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:32,408
That is inspiring.

1151
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,011
I just love the idea

1152
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,913
that something
could last that long.

1153
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,950
A wedding is sort of like
a seed you plant.

1154
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,818
Sometimes, it grows,

1155
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,689
and sometimes, it doesn't.

1156
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:49,058
But I never stopped
believing that it could.

1157
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,728
Except for yourself.

1158
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,468
Penne alla vodka
alla sal.

1159
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,870
Maybe
I wasn't clear

1160
00:49:00,872 --> 00:49:02,772
about this not
being a full meal?

1161
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,475
Wow.

1162
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:08,411
Mm!

1163
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,412
Mm.

1164
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:10,880
So good.

1165
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:13,549
I propose a toast.

1166
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,551
To Paul and Lucy.

1167
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:17,353
Yes.

1168
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:21,624
May the seed that we help plant
grow as tall as their love.

1169
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,093
Hmm.

1170
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,061
Too schmaltzy?

1171
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:26,595
A little.

1172
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,274
Thank you.

1173
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:40,376
I'm never eating again.

1174
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,613
Well, at least we can
agree on the caterer.

1175
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,749
We agree
on a lot of things.

1176
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,353
We're gonna get there,
don't worry about it.

1177
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,855
Well, we still
don't have a venue,

1178
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:56,125
and the wedding
is only a month away.

1179
00:49:58,562 --> 00:49:59,695
How did they meet,

1180
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,630
your cousin and Lucy?

1181
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,432
It was not
very romantic,

1182
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,501
But...
They were both golfing,

1183
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,571
and Lucy forgot to yell
"fore."

1184
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:10,306
He took a ball right to
the back of the head,

1185
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:12,074
knocked him flat
to the ground.

1186
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,048
Well...

1187
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,651
Well, um...

1188
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,825
Goodnight.

1189
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,395
Goodnight.

1190
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,432
Thank you.

1191
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,054
Wait!

1192
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:59,989
What?
What's the matter?

1193
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:01,757
I got it.

1194
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,192
I know where we can have the
wedding and the reception,

1195
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:05,494
and everybody
is going to love it.

1196
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:13,496
Really?

1197
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,841
I was playing right over
there.

1198
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,477
I hit the ball...

1199
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:22,344
Whack!

1200
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:23,612
Right in the head.

1201
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,816
I thought I'd killed him.

1202
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:30,820
I ran over,
and I was crying and...

1203
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:33,856
And I'm laying on my back, on
the grass, I'm kinda dizzy,

1204
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,391
and I look up at her...

1205
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:37,993
And he just
started laughing,

1206
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:41,363
and that made me
start laughing.

1207
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:42,898
And right away,

1208
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,934
I knew this was the girl
I wanted to marry.

1209
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,740
It was love
at first hit.

1210
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:54,777
So...

1211
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,879
What's the verdict?

1212
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,516
Yes.

1213
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:01,717
All right.

1214
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,119
Great.

1215
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,320
All right, we'll do
a welcome cocktail party

1216
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:05,554
over here,

1217
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:06,789
and then...

1218
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,158
Over here is where
we'll have the ceremony.

1219
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,559
I'm thinking

1220
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,827
we can frame it
with roses--

1221
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,196
And little
twinkle lights

1222
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:15,564
that's perfect.

1223
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:16,599
Now, in here

1224
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:17,800
is where we'll have
the reception.

1225
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,469
Oh, this is
so exciting.

1226
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,706
Twinkle lights?

1227
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,674
What's happening
to you, man?

1228
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:29,078
Maybe she's rubbing off
on me a little.

1229
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,080
You sure that's all?

1230
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,417
Will there be
centerpieces?

1231
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:38,554
Everyone loves to
take home the centerpiece.

1232
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:39,488
Absolutely.

1233
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,190
We're doing
fire and ice roses.

1234
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:42,958
And we'll set
some lights up

1235
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,926
along there,

1236
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:46,395
and speakers
over here in the back,

1237
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,297
and we'll put
the dj over there.

1238
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:49,732
Oh, that
reminds me,

1239
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:51,300
have you two picked out
your song yet?

1240
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,269
Song?

1241
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:56,539
For your first dance.

1242
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,506
Dance?

1243
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,375
Oh...

1244
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,978
Uh-oh.

1245
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,181
I always knew
my ballroom dancing lessons

1246
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:07,383
would come in handy one day.

1247
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:09,151
Let's hear the music.
Come on, everyone.

1248
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,720
I brought our song.

1249
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,489
I can't wait
to hear it.

1250
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,262
W-wait, how is that our
song?

1251
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:22,631
Don't you
remember, Paul?

1252
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,466
After you got hit in the
head with the golf ball,

1253
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:25,834
on our way to the hospital,

1254
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:28,504
it was playing
on the ambulance radio.

1255
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,907
That's not our song, honey.

1256
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,010
This is our song.

1257
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,049
Remember?

1258
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,017
The night we won
the bowling championships,

1259
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:43,652
they played it
over the P.A.

1260
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,693
Let's put
a pin in that.

1261
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:53,429
I've got something
that might work.

1262
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,908
That's lovely.

1263
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,110
Let's dance.

1264
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,449
Okay, now...

1265
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:17,953
♪ Forget the world now
we won't let them see ♪

1266
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:22,758
♪ But there's one thing
left to do ♪

1267
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,328
Ow!

1268
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,731
See, I told you
he can't dance.

1269
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,001
At his senior prom,
he broke his date's toe.

1270
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:33,369
Well, we can't have
that happening

1271
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,504
at their wedding.

1272
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:38,007
Maybe they should just
forget about it.

1273
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:39,074
No.

1274
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:40,743
It's okay.

1275
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:42,478
No, the first dance
is one of the best parts

1276
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,048
of the whole wedding.

1277
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,383
So let's show 'em.

1278
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,219
Uh...

1279
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:51,287
Uh, no,

1280
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,289
I don't usually participate.

1281
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:56,458
"Usually" is the enemy
of adventure.

1282
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,593
Come on.

1283
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:10,873
♪ Together can never be
close enough for me ♪

1284
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:17,146
♪ To feel like I am
close enough to you ♪

1285
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:19,648
♪ You wear white ♪

1286
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,285
♪ And I'll wear out
the words "I love you" ♪

1287
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:27,156
♪ And you're beautiful ♪

1288
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:32,795
♪ Now that the wait is over ♪

1289
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:36,098
♪ And love has
finally shown her... ♪

1290
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,034
Have you two
danced together before?

1291
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,937
No. Never.

1292
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:45,774
Hmm, well,
maybe you should.

1293
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:53,282
♪ Marry me ♪

1294
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:56,985

1296
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:22,511
I thought you said
you played.

1297
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:24,880
I'm taking it easy on you
'cause you're old.

1298
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,183
Well, what are you gonna
do at regionals?

1299
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,451
Come on.

1300
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:31,353
Something like...

1301
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:33,355
This!

1302
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:34,289
Oh--

1303
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,457
Oh!

1304
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:36,392
Yes!

1305
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:37,426
Nice shot. Nice shot.

1306
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:39,495
All right.

1307
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,764
All right,
that's enough!

1308
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:43,065
Homework.

1309
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,066
I already did it.

1310
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,435
I wasn't talking to you.

1311
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:49,405
Sorry, pally,
ya heard the lady.

1312
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,075
At least we'll always have
the driveway.

1313
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,485
Okay, I think we're in
pretty good shape.

1314
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,586
The only thing
we have to do now

1315
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,155
is the seating arrangements.

1316
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:07,389
Wait, wait.

1317
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,057
You keep telling me that
this is all about two people

1318
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:12,761
blending their lives
together, right?

1319
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,296
So, why can't people just
sit wherever they want?

1320
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:16,465
Because it helps things
run more smoothly.

1321
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:19,968
Weddings are stressful
enough without adding chaos.

1322
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,937
Okay, that is what
I don't understand.

1323
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,840
Why does a wedding have to
be stressful at all?

1324
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:29,111
Um, when was the last time
you were at a wedding?

1325
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,648
Um...
I don't remember.

1326
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,817
Okay, I'll pick you up
tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.

1327
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,452
Why, where are we going?

1328
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:37,653
I have
the Henderson wedding.

1329
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:39,555
You're coming with me.

1330
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:00,008
Hi!

1331
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,743
Is your dad home?

1332
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:03,512
Come on in!

1333
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:05,914
It's open!

1334
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,953
I'm here whenever you're
ready!

1335
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:11,987
I'm coming.

1336
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,021
Make yourself
at home.

1337
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,686
How do I look?

1338
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,722
Presentable.

1339
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,891
Ah, that's what
I was going for.

1340
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,127
I see you've met Howard.

1341
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:27,362
He's been
the perfect host.

1342
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:31,633
We bumped into each other
at a shelter,

1343
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:33,969
and we've been
best buddies ever since.

1344
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:44,313
Yeah, it's not
as good as yours, but...

1345
00:59:44,315 --> 00:59:46,281
Again, very presentable.

1346
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,653
So, dart day
on the 27th?

1347
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:53,355
Does that mean
that your birthday

1348
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:55,657
is the same day as
Paul and Lindsay's wedding?

1349
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:56,925
Yeah.

1350
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:57,993
That's
pretty cool, huh?

1351
00:59:57,995 --> 00:59:59,795
Yeah.

1352
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,930
Yeah, so, is that the day
you're going to pick the spot

1353
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,298
for your next trip yet?

1354
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,200
That's the day.

1355
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,705
Thank you.

1356
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,378
Well, let's go
to a wedding, hmm?

1357
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,393
First, the m.O.B.
Comes down the aisle.

1358
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:32,828
The-the what?

1359
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,229
"Mother of the bride."

1360
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,064
Just watch what happens.

1361
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,099
Okay.

1362
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,570
Madison, no!

1363
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:42,738
No, no, no, no!

1364
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,805
You're the flower girl!

1365
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,375
Oh, you've ruined
your dress!

1366
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:47,676
Don't worry, I brought
an extra dress for her

1367
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:48,944
in the car.

1368
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,112
Thank you, Jessica.
You're a lifesaver.

1369
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,214
Just get her cleaned up
and I'll be right back.

1370
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,018
Wow, you are good.

1371
01:00:58,888 --> 01:00:59,988
Just suck in--

1372
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,289
I'm sucking in.

1373
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,091
I told you
to get the other dress.

1374
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:04,326
Mom, please,
not right now--

1375
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,394
Just suck in, suck in.

1376
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:06,395
How's my bride?

1377
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:09,731
Mom!

1378
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:13,969
Don't panic,
I'll take care of this.

1379
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:16,438
Everybody go outside
and get some fresh air, huh?

1380
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:19,975
After you.

1381
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:22,711
Adam...

1382
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:23,979
We'll get this fixed
in just a minute.

1383
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:25,714
Okay?

1384
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:28,050
Okay...

1385
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:30,585
It's a nice dress.

1386
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:37,426
Just-just breathe,
breathe.

1387
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:38,927
Slower, slower...

1388
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,331
The ring?

1389
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:51,106
And so,

1390
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:52,340
by the power
vested in me

1391
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,176
by our great state,

1392
01:01:54,178 --> 01:01:56,211
I now pronounce you

1393
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,480
husband and wife.

1394
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,183
I see what you mean
about stress.

1395
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:02,184
Shh!

1396
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:03,919
This is the best part.

1397
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:08,323
You may kiss your bride.

1398
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,380
I've gotta admit,

1399
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,416
that was beautiful.

1400
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,651
We still have an hour
before Luke's game.

1401
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:38,653
Plenty of time
to get there.

1402
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:41,123
You seriously have never
missed a single game?

1403
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:42,557
Not one.

1404
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,126
I'm impressed, Jess.

1405
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:45,927
You've really got it
all figured out.

1406
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,295
I don't know about that.

1407
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:48,296
Come on, Jess,

1408
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:50,098
you're this amazing
wedding planner,

1409
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,099
you've got this great kid.

1410
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:54,102
You almost have
the perfect life.

1411
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,937
Almost?

1412
01:02:55,939 --> 01:03:00,809
I mean, you're this beautiful,
smart, successful woman.

1413
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:03,278
You deserve more.

1414
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,646
Like?

1415
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:07,949
Do I have to
spell it out?

1416
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:11,486
You bring so much
romance to others,

1417
01:03:11,488 --> 01:03:16,758
don't you think it's time
you had some for yourself?

1418
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,796
That's just not
in the plan right now.

1419
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:22,364
Is that the real reason?

1420
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:25,100
Or is it maybe because
you're a little bit scared?

1421
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:26,134
Please.

1422
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,203
I'm not the one
throwing darts at a map.

1423
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:29,538
That is not
the same thing.

1424
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,806
Really?

1425
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,174
You travel
all around the world,

1426
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:33,241
but never go to
the same place twice.

1427
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:34,342
It's like you're
event planning.

1428
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,545
You drop in,
the event happens,

1429
01:03:36,547 --> 01:03:39,147
boom, out the door
and done.

1430
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,649
What does that
have to do with anything?

1431
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:43,852
I just wonder what
you're running from.

1432
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,254
Oh, boy.

1433
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:50,859
Where's your spare?

1434
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:51,860
In the garage,

1435
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:53,695
where I put it,

1436
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:54,396
because I needed the storage
space in the trunk.

1437
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:55,297
I'm calling the auto club.

1438
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:57,199
I am not missing Luke's
game.

1439
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,135
Oh, no, I don't have a
signal.

1440
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:03,638
The game starts
in an hour.

1441
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,473
I got nothing.

1442
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:07,242
There's a building over
there, a house or something.

1443
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:08,743
Maybe they have
a land line I can use.

1444
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:09,744
Stay with the car,
I'll be right back.

1445
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:10,846
Are you kidding?

1446
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:11,913
Every horror movie
ever made

1447
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:13,849
starts like that.

1448
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:20,422
I'm coming with you.

1449
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:21,456
Hello?

1450
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:24,426
Anybody here?

1451
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,465
Still not
getting a signal.

1452
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:31,466
You?

1453
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:33,335
Uh...

1454
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:35,337
Um...

1455
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:37,839
Nope, nothing.

1456
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:40,041
If I miss his game...

1457
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,913
And what happens

1458
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:48,250
if you miss his game?

1459
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:50,118
Well, i...

1460
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,120
He, uh...

1461
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,956
Well, I just always
want to make sure

1462
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:58,526
that I make time
for him.

1463
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:02,597
But you can't
make time for you?

1464
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,268
No, i...

1465
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,937
I mean, yes, i...

1466
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:10,071
I guess I could.

1467
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:13,942
I'm just...

1468
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:16,378
Afraid of what might happen
if I do.

1469
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,783
Well, if we're being honest
here in the greenhouse,

1470
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:25,954
what you said before is
true.

1471
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:28,757
I am running,

1472
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:31,526
probably for the exact
same reasons you are.

1473
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:34,329
I'm afraid
I might get hurt, too.

1474
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:42,237
We're supposed to be
such good planners,

1475
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,507
you and me.

1476
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:46,942
How come we didn't plan
for this?

1477
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:58,653
Can I help you folks?

1478
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,191
Uh...

1479
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:07,896
Yes. Uh, do you have
a phone we could use?

1480
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,301
No, I missed it.

1481
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,637
I missed the game!

1482
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,638
Luke!

1483
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,572
Hey, mom!

1484
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:20,575
I am so sorry, honey.

1485
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:21,476
Mom, we won!

1486
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,477
We won regionals!

1487
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,645
We're going to the finals!

1488
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,513
Congratulations, sweetie.

1489
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,249
Nice work, pally.

1490
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:29,718
Thanks, fella.

1491
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:32,587
I am so sorry
we're late, honey.

1492
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:35,090
Mom, that's okay.

1493
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:36,958
No, it's not okay.
I feel terrible.

1494
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,259
I was just worried

1495
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:39,260
you were in an accident
or something.

1496
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:40,862
Hey, you won.

1497
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:42,097
Right?

1498
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:43,898
That's the most
important thing.

1499
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,234
Right?

1500
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:47,802
Okay, I want you to tell me
all about the game.

1501
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,270
Okay?

1502
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,046
Good boy.

1503
01:06:58,048 --> 01:06:59,447
Mom, come on,

1504
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:01,116
we gotta get a dog!

1505
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:03,218
We'll talk about it
later, sweetie.

1506
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,686
Come on, Howard.

1507
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,521
Get the ball,
get the ball, yeah!

1508
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,656
Good boy.

1509
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,760
Do you want the ball?
Do you want it?

1510
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:17,198
He is such
a great kid.

1511
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,434
Get it. Get it, yeah.

1512
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,308
I can't do this.

1513
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:36,684
Can't... or won't?

1514
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,954
I can't.

1515
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,526
So you missed
one basketball game.

1516
01:07:44,528 --> 01:07:45,727
So you're human.

1517
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,962
It's not just the game.

1518
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:51,699
It's... everything.

1519
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:53,535
You're throwing darts,

1520
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:56,404
and I'm raising a child.

1521
01:07:56,406 --> 01:08:00,341
I just have to focus on my son
and my business right now,

1522
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:01,543
and that's it.

1523
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,348
Now who's running away?

1524
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,287
That's not fair.

1525
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:13,655
It isn't.

1526
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,158
Not to either of us.

1527
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,564
We'll finish
the wedding together,

1528
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:23,598
and then,

1529
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,899
that's it.

1530
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:28,703
I hope you'll understand.

1531
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,541
I'm going to have to.

1532
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,811
I'm sorry.

1533
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:39,347
Luke, let's go!

1534
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:40,348
Bye, Howard!

1535
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:43,418
See you later, Luke!

1536
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,720
Not if I see you first.

1537
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,337
Good, good.

1538
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,639
Candelabra
on the head table.

1539
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,877
Oh, can you add some flowers
to this centerpiece?

1540
01:09:08,879 --> 01:09:10,512
It's a little lopsided.

1541
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,884
Whoa!

1542
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,586
I've got you.

1543
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:19,754
Thanks.

1544
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:21,089
We've come this far.

1545
01:09:21,091 --> 01:09:22,557
Don't want to lose
the wedding planner

1546
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,691
in the home stretch.

1547
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,228
Can you check on
the arbor lights?

1548
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:28,396
I think
they're flickering.

1549
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,198
On it.

1550
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:36,671
Well, tomorrow
is the big day.

1551
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:40,842
Everything is looking
so beautiful, Jessica,

1552
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,076
and I really do appreciate

1553
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:45,246
you and Adam
working together like this.

1554
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:48,283
I think it's going to be
a really lovely wedding.

1555
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:49,317
Yes!

1556
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:51,853
And you two
make a wonderful team.

1557
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:56,057
Maybe even... more?

1558
01:09:58,494 --> 01:09:59,861
Excuse me.

1559
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,473
Okay,

1560
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:13,675
time for bed.

1561
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,210
Aw, but, mom,

1562
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:18,213
that's the stuff
that dreams are made of.

1563
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,349
Come here.

1564
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,486
You know that I am never
going to miss

1565
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:27,722
another game of yours
again, right?

1566
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,290
You missed one game

1567
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,559
in what, three years?

1568
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,562
It's okay.

1569
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:39,033
You're allowed
to have a life, mom.

1570
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:40,201
I'll be right up.

1571
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:47,408
You think it'd be okay
if I went over to Adam's

1572
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,377
to play with
the dog sometime?

1573
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,479
Well, honey, you know,
after tomorrow,

1574
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:53,481
we're probably not going
to see very much of Adam.

1575
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:55,216
How come?

1576
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:57,018
Well, because we were just
working together on the wedding,

1577
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,388
and once it's over,
well, that's that.

1578
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:09,097
You know I'll always need
you

1579
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,299
and you'll always be
my mom, right?

1580
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,201
Right.

1581
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:17,972
But I don't need you
all the time

1582
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:20,708
like when I did
when I was little.

1583
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,110
What are you trying to say?

1584
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,246
It's just...

1585
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:28,683
If you ever decided
you wanted to have,

1586
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:32,754
you know, a boyfriend?

1587
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:34,155
I'd be cool with that.

1588
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,026
Especially if
he was someone like Adam.

1589
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:46,668
Well. Thank you.

1590
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:51,005
But Adam
has his own life,

1591
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:53,107
and so do we.

1592
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,044
I love you.

1593
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,558
Jessica summers
wedding designs.

1594
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,493
Jessica speaking.

1595
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:20,962
<i>Jess, it's me.</i>

1596
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:22,463
Hi. What's up?

1597
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,436
We got a problem.

1598
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:30,872
Get dressed, honey.

1599
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:32,106
We're going to Katie's.

1600
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:33,107
Why?

1601
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,575
Wedding emergency.

1602
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,955
Oh, no, it just doesn't
stop.

1603
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,792
They don't know exactly
how it happened,

1604
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:54,662
but the sprinkler
system cracked,

1605
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:55,963
and they're concerned

1606
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:58,332
that the whole thing
might collapse.

1607
01:13:58,334 --> 01:14:00,334
They're shutting us down.

1608
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:02,870
It's ruined.

1609
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:03,871
Everything is ruined.

1610
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:05,673
Look at this.

1611
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:08,676
Poor Lucy and Paul.

1612
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,445
We're going to have to
cancel everything.

1613
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,514
Are we?

1614
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,718
No.

1615
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,786
Call our vendors.

1616
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,289
There's been a change of
plans.

1617
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,171
Amy's cake shop.

1618
01:14:44,214 --> 01:14:45,413
What's up?

1619
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,317
Mm-hmm.

1620
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,627
Yes?

1621
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,530
Yes.

1622
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:19,280
All of this
from a flat tire.

1623
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:58,553
I take you, Lucy,

1624
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:01,088
to be my wife,
my partner,

1625
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,924
and my best friend.

1626
01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:04,358
I still can't believe

1627
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,460
I'm the one
who gets to marry you

1628
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:07,995
and walk beside you

1629
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:10,698
wherever life's journey
leads us.

1630
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,178
I take you, Paul,
to be my husband,

1631
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,714
my partner,
and my best friend.

1632
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:29,283
I promise
to walk beside you

1633
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,252
wherever life's journey
leads us.

1634
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:34,555
And to never mention
pink bow ties again.

1635
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,471
By the authority
vested in me,

1636
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:53,274
I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

1637
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,210
Congratulations,

1638
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:57,912
you may kiss your bride.

1639
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,572
Looks like he finally
got the hang of it.

1640
01:18:01,611 --> 01:18:02,843
Yeah, it's funny
what you can learn

1641
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,046
when you put
your whole heart into it.

1642
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:09,016
So... do you know yet
where you're going

1643
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,484
on your big trip tomorrow?

1644
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,822
No, I haven't
thrown my dart.

1645
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,192
Wow.

1646
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:22,997
Jessica,

1647
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:27,134
I just want to thank you
for all of this.

1648
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:28,896
None of this would have
happened without you.

1649
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,707
Or you.

1650
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:36,143
We made a good team.

1651
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,348
I, um...

1652
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,650
I should go.

1653
01:18:42,652 --> 01:18:44,318
I told Luke
that I wouldn't be late,

1654
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,688
and, uh, I'll meet the crew here
in the morning for clean-up.

1655
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:48,689
So--

1656
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:51,926
Jess...

1657
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:53,294
Goodbye, Adam.

1658
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,501

Are you crazy?

1665
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:22,289
You two are a perfect match.

1666
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:27,528
I guess you can't plan for
these things, aunt Gabby.

1667

purple dresses.

1675
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:59,126
Yeah, no, absolutely.

1676
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,061
Okay.

1677
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:02,496
Okay, thank you.

1678
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:03,731
Bye-bye.

1679
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:38,966
Mom, we gotta leave
in, like, half an hour.

1680
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:40,401
Okay, honey!

1681
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,877
Are we going for a pizza
after the game?

1682
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:52,246
Yeah, sure, we always...

1683
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:54,715
How about thai food?

1684
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:57,952
Um, I love thai food,

1685
01:20:57,954 --> 01:21:00,487
but we usually have pizza
on Saturdays.

1686
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:03,290
"Usually" is the enemy
of adventure.

1687
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:04,892
And I think it's time

1688
01:21:04,894 --> 01:21:06,126
we brought a little more
adventure into our lives.

1689
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:07,895
Wow, mom.

1690
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:09,964
Take a walk
on the wild side.

1691
01:21:16,806 --> 01:21:18,772
Jessica summers
wedding designs.

1692
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:19,907
Jessica speaking.

1693
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:21,242
<i>Yeah, hi,</i>

1694
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:23,077
<i>I'd like to see about
booking you for a wedding?</i>

1695
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:24,812
Hmm. Okay,
what's the date?

1696
01:21:24,814 --> 01:21:26,013
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

1697
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:27,781
All right, well,
we need to know that

1698
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:30,017
before we can start
making arrangements.

1699
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:31,518
<i>Well, the thing is,</i>

1700
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,188
<i>I haven't asked
the bride-to-be yet.</i>

1701
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,691
I see.

1702
01:21:37,693 --> 01:21:40,928
And what's stopping you
from asking her?

1703
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,229
<i>I'm a little nervous</i>

1704
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,530
since she's kind of
out of my league,

1705
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:46,834
and it's a really
long story,

1706
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:48,302
but I'm really hoping

1707
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:50,170
that it has a happy ending.

1708
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:52,273
Mom, look,
Howard's here.

1709
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:53,240
Here. Here, boy,

1710
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,074
I got something for you.

1711
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:54,909
Come here.

1712
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:57,044
Howard...

1713
01:21:58,346 --> 01:21:59,914
Hi.

1714
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,382
Hi.

1715
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,225
You know, i...

1716
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:14,762
I don't know
anything about adventure.

1717
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:17,331
I do.

1718
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:24,772
But i...

1719
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:28,042
I thought you didn't
believe in marriage.

1720
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:30,911
I'm tired of planning things
that only last a day.

1721
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:32,246
Boom,

1722
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:34,181
out the door and done.

1723
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:36,216
Yeah?

1724
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:41,755
I want to start planning
things that last a lifetime.

1725
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:42,723
With you.

1726
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:47,695

1727

What happened to
your birthday trip?

1728
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:59,306
Funny thing about that is...

1729
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:02,109
I threw my dart,

1730
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:04,445
and it landed here,

1731
01:23:04,447 --> 01:23:06,814
