1
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,450
Turn over to the right.

2
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,912
You're squinting. Don't look
into the sun. Look at the camera.

3
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,039
Okay, run your fingers
through your hair.

4
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,549
Open your eyes, wide open.

5
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,135
One hand on your hip.

6
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,265
And smile.

7
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,806
Well, we are finished here.
These will be great.

8
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,983
- Thank you, Bunny.
- Well, go have fun with your boyfriend.

9
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,773
He's waiting so patiently.

10
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,365
- So Armond, what'd you think?
- Beautiful as ever.

11
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,080
So you can spend
a few more days here?

12
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,370
No, you know
I have to get back to work.

13
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,086
Well, we'll just have to make
the most of the time we have.

14
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,629
Maybe I'll come back some day.

15
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:10,492
- Hello, Irving.
- Good afternoon, Bettie.

16
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,660
- How was your trip?
- It was fabulous,

17
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,992
but you know
I always miss New York.

18
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,909
Well, you're too late today,
so you'll have to come back tomorrow.

19
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:20,998
How was your week?

20
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,663
Weeks are better
when I put out pictures of you.

21
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,130
Stop joshing me.
See you tomorrow.

22
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,263
Chop chop.
Time is money.

23
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,898
I'm ready if Paula is.

24
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,024
Bettie, are you ready?

25
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,481
I am, Irving, but can we please
have some music?

26
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,905
There's no time for that.
We are ready to shoot.

27
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,906
I'm ready!

28
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,784
All right, action!

29
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,611
And cut.
Okay, we're done.

30
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,077
Everybody, same time,
same place, tomorrow.

31
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,508
Irving? Irving?

32
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,884
Do you mind if I get paid now
instead of the end of the week?

33
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,847
If I give you an advance, can you do
some other shoots tomorrow?

34
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,727
I've been getting
some special requests.

35
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,059
Sure, I'll be there.

36
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,276
Thank you.

37
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,513
- You look so pretty with your tan.
- Thank you.

38
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,175
Do you think I can go to Florida
with you next time?

39
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,720
- Maybe, if you're nice.
- I'll be nice.

40
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,691
Oh, I see how nice you are.

41
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,951
So, Marvin,

42
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,410
what do you say
that we study our script

43
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,870
for tomorrow's audition?

44
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,460
- All right.
- Okay?

45
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,541
- Yeah.
- All right.

46
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,707
I'll be back.

47
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,219
Okay, one for you.

48
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,052
All right, let's go.

49
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,809
You know how I feel about you,

50
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,730
with your raven hair
and bronze skin.

51
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,695
But you know we cannot marry.

52
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,734
Father would never hear of it.

53
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,120
He has promised me to another.

54
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,039
Run away with me.

55
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,169
Sometimes I... I don't think

56
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,872
you even see us as a couple.

57
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,007
I do.

58
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,253
I picture us happy...

59
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,013
in our home...

60
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,516
with the white picket fence,

61
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,678
two kids and a dog.

62
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,643
I do think that way about us.

63
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,682
You mean the world to me.

64
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,194
I see you in my dreams
every night,

65
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,823
but then Father and Mr. Reynolds
come and take me away from you.

66
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,870
Run away with me.

67
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,740
Okay.

68
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,629
- So I think we did pretty good.
- Yeah.

69
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,540
I hope I get the part tomorrow.

70
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,255
You're gonna get
bigger roles than that.

71
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,465
Look how popular your pictures are.

72
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,473
I know,
but I wanna be an actress.

73
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,677
You will.

74
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,688
- You will.
- Thank you for having faith in me.

75
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,654
So how do you like
the new spurs?

76
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,615
I like them.

77
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,323
- What are we doing today?
- You're tying the ropes.

78
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,501
Your hair looks great.
Come on, let's go.

79
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,832
Come on Bettie, let's go.

80
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,141
Jack, we are all set.

81
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,358
Bettie, why don't you spank her
with the hairbrush?

82
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,448
Great, Bettie.
How about some stills?

83
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,702
Beautiful.

84
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,543
Oh, yeah.

85
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,263
Yeah, how about one more?

86
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,396
Perfect.
Great.

87
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,058
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

88
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,648
Why don't you go get changed?
And Jack, why don't you pack up?

89
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,729
We'll go meet Irving
and get something to eat.

90
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,899
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

91
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,620
- Yeah, should be fine.
- I think it will be too.

92
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,918
Okay.

93
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,464
Okay, Irving, what are they saying
about "Teaserama"?

94
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,848
Well, let's see.

95
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,439
"'Teaserama' stars stripper
Tempest Storm.

96
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,645
Other girls include
Chris LaChris,

97
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,606
Twinnie Wallen, Vicki Lynn,

98
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,528
Cherrie Knight,
and Trudy Wayne.

99
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,782
Bettie Page as the showcard girl
is underrated.

100
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,695
She has the beauty, the build,
and the presence to steal my heart.

101
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,829
Her expressions are classic,

102
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,912
and she's more amazing in motion
than she is in her stills.

103
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,203
Miss Storm is one of the biggest
tease artists of all time.

104
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,212
You can see
why she is such a delight.

105
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:09,089
However, Miss Page steals
the scene as Miss Storm's maid."

106
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,512
Wow.

107
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,673
And here's some more
about you, Bettie.

108
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,934
"'Teaserama' is the biggest
burlesque film ever.

109
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,058
The sexy Tennessee tease
Miss Bettie Page

110
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,689
terms up with that hurricane of delight,
Miss Tempest Storm

111
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:26,019
in a boudoir bit
that scorches the screen.

112
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,812
I'm convinced that there will never
be another like Bettie.

113
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,448
Forget the comics.
They're awful.

114
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,699
And enjoy the ladies. Bettie Page
completely outshines the rest."

115
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,616
- Bettie.
- Y'all have very big imaginations.

116
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,829
Hey, listen to this.

117
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,211
"I was pleasantly surprised

118
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:48,249
by the fresh, sexy,
and flirtatious 'Teaserama.'

119
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,884
Miss Page always seems
to be having a good time...

120
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,922
the most attractive
and alluring woman ever."

121
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,135
Here, and what about this one?

122
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,222
"With her girl-next-door smile
and hourglass figure,

123
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,559
Bettie Page performs
two stylized dance numbers.

124
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,598
As a favorite
photographer's model

125
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,644
and a girlie film cutie,
she isn't a real stripper,

126
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,979
but rather a lovely 'come-on girl."'

127
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,316
Bettie, you're a star.

128
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,737
Irving, you're being silly.

129
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,746
Let's just enjoy our dinner.

130
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,498
Could you pass me
the water, Irving?

131
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,205
- Yeah, sure.
- Want some wine, sweetie?

132
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,041
- Yeah, I'll have some wine.
- Here you go, Bettie.

133
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,053
Hello? Irving.

134
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,965
Yes.

135
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,726
So you saw Bettie in a magazine.

136
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,853
Yes.

137
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,191
Well, how can I help you?

138
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,771
Screen test?

139
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,570
Hollywood?

140
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,118
For Howard Hughes?

141
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,497
I think she would love
to do a screen test.

142
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:07,002
The number is Greenwich-543...

143
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,312
Hello, Miss Page.
I hope your flight was a pleasant one.

144
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,022
- It was, thank you.
- Well, good.

145
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,903
- Right this way, then.
- Okay, thank you.

146
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,662
Here are some costumes to try on.
Pick whatever you like.

147
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,997
Okay. Thank you.

148
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,517
Come in.

149
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,189
Mr. Hughes, Miss Page
is changing right now.

150
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,851
Thank you, Jimmy.
That'll be all for now.

151
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,941
Okay, just tell us about yourself.

152
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:47,822
Okay. Hey there,
my name is Bettie Page.

153
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,833
I am 5'5" tall.

154
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,915
I have black hair and blue eyes.

155
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,626
I live in New York City.

156
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,633
I'm originally from Tennessee.

157
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,759
I was the second runner-up

158
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,013
in the Miss New York Pageant in 1951,

159
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,638
and uh...

160
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,770
I guess that's it.
Thank you.

161
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,525
Great. Thanks.
We're done here.

162
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,484
Well, thank you.
So do I meet Mr. Hughes now?

163
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,991
We thank you very much for your time,
but Mr. Hughes has left for the day.

164
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,702
Okay, did you want me
to come back tomorrow?

165
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,117
Actually, we're done.
So you can change,

166
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,160
and have a safe flight
back to New York.

167
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,330
Thank you.

168
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,353
Run away with me.

169
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,607
Sometimes, I wonder if you ever
see us as a couple...

170
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,191
together, happy,

171
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,731
in our home...

172
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,571
with a white-picket fence,

173
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,278
two kids and a dog.

174
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,531
I do see us that way.

175
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,370
I think about you
every night in my dreams

176
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,043
and it's wonderful,

177
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,956
but then it turns
into a nightmare

178
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,341
when Mr. Reynolds and my father
come and take me away from you.

179
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,503
Run away with me.

180
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,267
You all right, Bettie?

181
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,937
Irving had me do
the strangest thing today.

182
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,106
He had me down on all fours,

183
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,400
with this leather harness
on my head.

184
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,952
You couldn't even tell it was me.

185
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,784
You know, I wish you didn't
even do the bondage stuff.

186
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,082
Marvin, you know I have
to do the bondage.

187
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,209
I don't get paid if I don't do it.

188
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,129
I don't get hurt and it pays
twice as much as the regular stuff.

189
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,588
Yeah, I know,
but I mean, maybe...

190
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,134
maybe that's why Howard Hughes
never called you back.

191
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,641
I thought we agreed
not to talk about my trip to L.A.

192
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,474
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

193
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,560
It's just... I wanna be
an actress, Marvin.

194
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,101
I'm not getting anywhere.

195
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,112
All right, you know what?
Why don't we skip the review?

196
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,989
Who cares what a bunch
of stupid critics think, anyway?

197
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,151
What matters is
that you and I had fun.

198
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,365
No, I wanna hear it.

199
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,491
All right.

200
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,872
"The dry drama
'Lovers Down the Lane'

201
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,509
starring Mr. Marvin Greene
and Miss Bettie Page,

202
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,171
will pass
with no more notice than this.

203
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,050
While Mr. Greene's
performance is adequate,

204
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,686
Miss Page attempts to play
a Boston socialite

205
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,017
with a Tennessee accent.

206
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,233
This pin-up model
ought to leave her clothes at home."

207
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,366
I can't believe this.
I'm going home.

208
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,323
Bettie. Bettie.

209
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,970
All right, Peggy, you're all set.

210
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,096
Bettie?

211
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,139
Do I pass muster?

212
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,645
Well, you will
with one more pair of panties.

213
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,023
- One more? I've already got two.
- You know I can't have any hair visible

214
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,435
- down there.
- All right,

215
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,774
give me a minute.

216
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,109
- Paula, are you ready?
- As ready as I'll ever be.

217
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,525
The cameras
are all set up and loaded.

218
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,986
All right, everyone, let's go.

219
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,253
That was great, ladies.

220
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,297
We have time for one more.

221
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,432
- Okay.
- Okay.

222
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,803
Does my hair look all right?

223
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,786
Looks good, let's go.

224
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,526
Bettie, we have a session
next week in the woods.

225
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,577
- Are you interested?
- Sure.

226
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,659
Good.

227
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,079
So, wanna go meet
those other photographers later?

228
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,460
- Is that tonight?
- Yes.

229
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,838
Sure, just let me get changed.

230
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,810
Good evening, ladies.
So nice you could join us.

231
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,358
- Good. Hello.
- Hi there.

232
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,860
- Hello.
- Can I...

233
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,862
get you something to drink?

234
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,194
- Sure.
- How about for you?

235
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,076
- I would love a root beer.
- A root beer?

236
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,284
Oh, that can't be right.
Let me make you something stronger.

237
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,707
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

238
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,868
Nah, I don't smoke,
thank you.

239
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,592
Just use the glass as a prop.
You don't have to drink it.

240
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:09,055
Well, you boys are so cute.
I guess it would be okay.

241
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,470
Well, what do you say?

242
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:19,231
- Wanna take some pictures, I guess?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,569
Oh, that's very nice.

244
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,232
- You look very friendly.
- Just one little sip?

245
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,367
For me?

246
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,705
Oh, see?

247
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,867
- Cheers.
- This is her first time.

248
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,088
Why don't you two get friendly?

249
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,589
Very nice.

250
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,599
Okay.

251
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,816
Peggy.

252
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,946
Turn around.

253
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,234
It's hot in here, isn't it?

254
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,543
Button button,
who's got the button?

255
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:28,005
- How many buttons do you got?
- One.

256
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,761
One.

257
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,675
Two.

258
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,595
Two.

259
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:43,392
- Three.
- Give me three.

260
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,910
- Are my two Janes ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

261
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,868
- Ready as can be.
- Love the bikini, Bettie.

262
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,034
Thank you, I made it myself.

263
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,315
Cut.

264
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,734
Jeanne, take that gag
out of her mouth.

265
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:37,165
Are you all right?
Do you need a minute?

266
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,375
Yes, please.

267
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,675
All right, let's get the stills done
so we can get her down from there.

268
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,202
Okay, Jeanne, try spanking her.

269
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,538
Great.

270
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,834
Uh, one more.

271
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,212
Great.

272
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,681
That should do it.

273
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,986
Hi, we're with the FBI.
I'm Agent Burke.

274
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,371
- This is Agent Swanson.
- What's this all about?

275
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,078
We need to ask you some questions
about Irving Klaw.

276
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:01,086
- Irving's done nothing wrong.
- And how do you explain these?

277
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,837
These pictures were taken
by some camera club photographers.

278
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,971
Irving didn't even take those pictures.

279
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:19,480
Here's a subpoena.
You can explain that all in court.

280
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,641
Ma'am.

281
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,783
Pin-up king Irving Klaw
was summoned to testify

282
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,411
before the Senate Obscenity
Investigation Committee Thursday.

283
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,784
Tennessee Senator
Estes Kefauver accused Klaw

284
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,870
of distributing pornography,
contributing

285
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,000
- to the delinquency of minors.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

286
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,253
I call this

287
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,831
the worst pornography

288
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,840
of any kind!

289
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,093
Mr. Klaw sells
fetish, bondage, whipping

290
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,342
and torture photographs of women
from his downtown New York shop.

291
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:57,135
According to Kefauver, the photos
are obscene by any reasonable standard.

292
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,974
Because in any other words,

293
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,606
these images are obscene.

294
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:05,730
These images are immoral

295
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,982
in any standard we hold

296
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,987
in this country.

297
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,865
When questioned about the
12-year-old girls on his mailing list,

298
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,448
Klaw claimed they only request
photographs of movie stars,

299
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,325
like Jimmy Stewart or Doris Day.

300
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:21,750
I assure you that these
are for movie star stills only.

301
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,208
They are not cross-referenced
with our other customers.

302
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,380
Klaw denied
selling nude photographs,

303
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,337
insisting that he frequently
made his models

304
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,627
wear multiple articles
of the same type of clothing.

305
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:36,174
In the entire history of my company
Movie Star News,

306
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,559
neither myself
nor my sister Paula Klaw

307
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,188
have produced, advertised
or distributed

308
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,021
any photos
containing nude models.

309
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,481
Earlier, Dr. William Olson,
a psychiatrist,

310
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,114
testified that Mr. Klaw's
cartoon and model parade catalogue

311
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:56,197
intends to stimulate people erotically
in an abnormal way.

312
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,738
Mr. Kefauver summed up the day's
proceedings saying to Mr. Klaw,

313
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:03,455
"Your products fall into
a twilight zone of obscene material."

314
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,848
You're still here?

315
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,479
Pardon me.
I'm here to testify.

316
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,266
They all left hours ago.

317
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,651
It's 1:00 in the morning.

318
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,071
I wish somebody would've
told me something.

319
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:36,153
Come with me. I will unlock the door
so you can go home.

320
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,425
How are you doing, Irving?

321
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,586
Are we gonna start
shooting again?

322
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,096
Bettie, I'm not going
to be shooting

323
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,849
any more pictures or movies.

324
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:05,805
Well, you're cleared
of all charges.

325
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:10,814
- Why not?
- I'm just too tired.

326
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,445
I'm really sorry, Bettie.

327
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,480
Good luck.

328
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:19,277
Well, thank you for everything.

329
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,457
You too, sweetheart.

330
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,634
Okay. Take care.

331
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,761
Okay.

332
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,888
Bye.

333
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,062
Oh, God!

334
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:35,204
Hi, operator?
May I have the police, please?

335
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,414
Thank you.

336
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,214
Last time.
Just stand here,

337
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,601
we will go that direction, and we
will be watching you the entire time.

338
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,853
- Okay.
- Do you have any questions?

339
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,272
No.
No, I think I got it.

340
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,433
Great. Let's get into position.

341
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,523
We'll be at your side the moment
someone goes for the package.

342
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,939
- Okay. Okay, I'm ready.
- Okay.

343
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,826
Oh, God.

344
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:59,416
Hi, yes, operator?
Yeah, Miami Beach,

345
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,793
50-432.

346
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,706
Okay, thank you.

347
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,509
- Hello?
- Armond?

348
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,046
- Hi, it's Bettie.
- Hey, Bettie.

349
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,382
- How are you?
- Fantastic. I've thought of you.

350
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,391
Well, I've been thinking of you too.

351
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,302
What about your boyfriend?
Is he there?

352
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:21,972
No, I'm not seeing him anymore.

353
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,311
I miss you.

354
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,976
I miss you too.

355
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,145
So how is New York?

356
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:30,860
Well, actually I was thinking
about making a trip to Miami.

357
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,649
I just wanted to make sure
you were there.

358
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,988
You wanna move to Miami?

359
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,154
Move to Florida?
Yeah, right.

360
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:39,664
Where would I live?

361
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,201
You can live here.
I've got a pretty big place.

362
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,248
I can't live with you,
not unless we get married.

363
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,255
We could always get married.

364
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:54,887
Well, we would have to get
reacquainted first.

365
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,216
Yes, I know.

366
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,510
Okay, we'll talk about it
when I get there.

367
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,020
Okay.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

368
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,977
Okay, okay.

369
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,109
- I'll see you soon.
- Have a safe trip, all right?

370
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,314
- All right.
- Okay?

371
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,070
Okay, I'll see you soon.

372
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,232
- Bye, Armond.
- Bye.

373
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,257
Armond,
it's New Year's Eve.

374
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,343
Can't we go out dancing?

375
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,348
We don't ever do anything.

376
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,225
What do you want me to do?

377
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,977
Look, all you care about
is eating hamburgers,

378
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,560
watching movies and having sex.

379
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,975
At least I'm satisfied
with what I have.

380
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:52,487
You know, we've been married five weeks
and I'm already regretting this.

381
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,818
I am bored to tears.
