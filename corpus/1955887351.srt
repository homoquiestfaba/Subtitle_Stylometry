when I move in with my dad.

175
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,731
We talked about this, Mo.

176
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,153
He's not your legal
guardian anymore.

177
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,363
Well...

178
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,367
he said he wanted
to adopt me, so...

179
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,707
I know the last few homes
have been difficult.

180
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,169
But I do think Lucila...

181
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,356
could be a really good family...

182
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,674
No, she's not my fucking family!

183
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,656
You lucky you skipped algebra.

184
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,475
Ms. Nestor gave us a quiz, and I
swear that shit wasn't even math.

185
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,145
What, you not talking to me now?
What'd I do?

186
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,063
Watch it.

187
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,091
- Say that shit to my face!
- Mo.

188
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,384
Watch out!

189
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,301
Mo, chill!

190
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,680
Get off of me! Bitch, if
you don't get off of me...

191
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,056
- Mo!
- Fuck you!

192
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,142
- Calm down.
- She started it!

193
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,811
Get the fuck off me!

194
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,920
This is the third
fight this month.

195
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,257
As I've explained to Monique,
she'll be suspended for three days.

196
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,069
She needs a positive outlet
to channel that anger.

197
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,071
I'd love to see her
reach her potential.

198
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:52,391
She's been given many opportunities, but
I cannot allow this kind of behavior.

199
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,979
What's going
on? What's going on...

200
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,584
with the door and the trash?

201
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,026
We gotta go. Come on.

202
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,526
Here we go.

203
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,428

Happy Meal toys?

211
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,873

- Please. Like you own this block.

I'm coming from wrestling
practice, if you so nosey.

00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,096
Coach say I'm gonna be
his best lightweight.

220
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,785
They got a girls'
wrestling team?

221
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,310
Nah, I'ma wrestle boys.

222
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,875

wrestling on no boys' team.

'Sup, troublemaker?

228
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,067
Still letting
people on the team?

229
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,278
Practice starts at three.

230
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,448
Gives you exactly four minutes
to stop wasting my time.

231
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,594
- You ain't hear me?
- Coach, you need anything?

232
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,013
I said, you still letting
people on the team?

233
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,037
It's a boys' team.

234
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,599
Could've fooled me.

235
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,601
Besides, I need a positive
outlet for my anger.

236
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,751
Right, Coach?

237
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,979
No one here's interested
in your games.

238
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,880
- You see me talking to you?
- Hey.

239
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,715
You wanna try out?

240
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,361
- Coach, you ain't serious.
- Take a knee. Now.

241
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,930
- You seen what she did to my girl?

00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,901
English, lady.

348
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,070
I'll pray for you.

349
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,094
Ten more seconds. Finish strong.

350
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,930
- Let's go, champ.
- Come on, wrestle hard.

351
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,243
- Oh, shit.
- Come on. Come on, yo.

352
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,893
Ooh.

353
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,439
- Chad, nine. Chris, four.
- Yeah!

354
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,043
All right, next up.

355
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,028
- Next up.
- Come on, O.

356
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,008
Go ahead, O.

357
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,010
- Let's get it, kid.
- That's enough.

358
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,261
That's enough. Omari.

359
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,513
You wresting off of 120, or
you busy wetting your pants?

360
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,791
Put her in her place, man.

361
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,543
Drop her ass.

362
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,653
- There it go.
- Yeah.

363
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,030
- Let's get that.
- There you go.

364
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,364
Duck under, man.

365
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,450
Don't tie up. Wrestle hard.
Let's go, O.

366
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,017
Enough dancing,
somebody take a shot.

367
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,163
- See what I mean?
- Oh, damn!

368
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,081
- Sweep.
- Let's go, O. Get up.

369
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,125
Come on, O. Get
out of that shit.

370
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,149
Here we go.

371
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,779
Come on, bro. She mad scrawny.

372
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,344
I would end this
shit in 30 seconds.

373
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,661
Get her down, O.

374
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,955
No, no, no.

375
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,041
Ooh!

376
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,227
Damn. You gonna let
a girl dominate?

377
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,087
Get up, O. Get up.

378
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,923
Oh! Shit.

379
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,942
Damn, O.

380
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,736
We got ourselves a new starter.

381
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,557
Get that signed before
Saturday's match.

382
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,786
Thought we was gonna have
to call the ambulance.

383
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,061
Yeah, okay, okay.

384
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,249
You couldn't beat a girl.
What are you doing?

385
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,044
You so shook, you ain't even
give me a chance to take you

386
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,672
- and your big titties down.
- Oh!

387
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,257
Yo, you like it rough, huh?

388
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,551
- I'm down with that.
- Nigga, please.

389
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,346
Y'all too busy jerking each other off
at McDonald's to make morning run?

390
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,348
- Oh, shit.
- She's right.

391
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,040
All ya'll fucking lazy.

392
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,210
Yo, Mo, is it true
your dad trains you?

393
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,231
Yeah. So?

394
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,090
Omari said he won states.

395
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,217
He gonna come to the match?

396
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,428
He'll be there.

397
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,724
By a hundred-pound girl.

398
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,160
She was on your ass.

399
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,745
I let her win. You heard her.

400
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,187
She said, "My dad trained me."

401
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,738
You ain't gonna tell me
you were getting out?

402
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,656
I gotta find out in the streets.

403
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,307
Still need to lay low.

404
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,810
Yo, what up, shorty?

405
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,206
You remember Monique?

406
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,125
Yeah, I seen her round the way.

407
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,359
Growing up real nice,
just like her mommy.

408
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,112
What you need?

409
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,884
Nothing. Just came to let
you know I made varsity.

410
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,908
No shit?

411
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,787
What type of team you
make, baby girl?

412
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,098
They got girls wrestling now.
You believe that shit?

413
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,350
Yeah, I can believe that.

414
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,395
I seen some bitches get
nastier than my pits.

415
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,088
She got her pops'
fighting genes, I guess.

416
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,886
We got our first
match on Saturday.

417
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,721
I'd like to see that.

418
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,768
All right, that it?

419
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,270
Starts at four. Hedgeman.

420
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,904
All right, then.

421
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,911
- So she's staying by you again?
- Nah.

422
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,873
You know I got a living
situation set up for you.

423
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,895
- Gotta think about it.
- What you mean, think about it?

424
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,272
I'm trying to give you
a better situation.

425
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,923
You gotta think about that?

426
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,851
You don't answer her calls.

427
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,413
- You come home beat up.
- The fuck's she talking about?

428
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,082
Look. Covered in bruises.

429
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,166
Ain't like she think.

430
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,001
She's also missing some jewelry.

431
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,862
I told her I ain't steal
her ugly-ass earrings.

432
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,967
There's a group home in the
Bronx that has a spot open.

433
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,219
The Bronx? You know how far
that is from my school?

434
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,763
- There's a school near the home.
- No, look.

435
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,415
That wrestling coach she met,
he gonna teach me, like...

436
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,333
discipline and all that.

437
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,751
See?

438
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,149
- Wrestling?
- Yeah.

439
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,885
What's she saying?
What's wrestling?

440
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,802
Uh...

441
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,952
I think... she joined the
wrestling team at her school.

442
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,976
Wrestling?

443
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,913
Like with costumes?

444
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,690
No, like in high school.
The sport.

445
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,318
But that's not for girls.

446
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,571
Ask him, he gonna keep me
out of trouble. I swear.

447
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,119
Easy.

448
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,829
On the inside.

449
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,541
Foot on the inside, man!

450
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,125
Let's go.

451
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,338
Jamal, get your legs back.

452
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,742
What?

453
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,643
Let's go.

454
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,357
You know you gotta go beast
on their asses, right?

455
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,526
Come on, ref, make 'em wrestle.

456
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,955
Get to your base.
Get to your base.

457
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,500
They fit all right?

458
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,632
Yeah. Thanks.

459
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:53,887
Gotta loosen up.

460
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,559
You'll be all right.

461
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,271
Plus, the kid you're
wrestling, he's a freshman.

462
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,334
Besides, he ain't seen
your magic weapon.

463
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,527
Mo. You're up.

464
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,679
Remember, keep him in front
of you, and don't tie up.

465
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,787
Look for the shot.

466
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,791
Hey, hey, where's your head at?

467
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,501
All right? Okay.

468
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,447
Seriously?

469
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,700
- How's this even allowed?
- How are you even allowed?

470
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,702
- 'Cause I'm a dude.
- Why you crying like a bitch?

471
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,828
Mo, cool it!

472
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,688
Knock that off. You're
here to wrestle.

473
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,024
In the middle.

474
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,404
Shake hands.

475
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,907
Let's go. Shake hands.

476
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,873
Let's go, Mo! Let's go!

477
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,457
Stop him.

478
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,144
Keep him in front of you.

479
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,354
Make it quick, Santo.

480
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,378
Don't tie up!

481
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,899
Work the score.

482
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,717
Take a shot. Take a shot.

483
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,196
- Two.
- That's it!

484
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,513
That's it! That's it!

485
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,872
Santo! Santo! Santo!

486
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,481
Off your back! Off your back!

487
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:27,958
Two.

488
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,084
Come on.

489
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,651
- Three.
- Bridge!

490
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,070
Four.

491
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,950
Okay, it's Red's choice.

492
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,369
Red chose top. Green, set up.

493
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,498
Red, get set.

494
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,708
Up and out, Mo. Up and out.

495
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,171
Easy.

496
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,463
Come on, Mo.

497
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,674
Watch the fingers.

498
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,611
Come on, Mo.

499
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,929
Let's go, Mo! Let's go, Mo!

500
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,348
- Come on, Mo!
- One, green.

501
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,099
One.

502
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,309
Two.

503
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,478
Three.

504
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,315
- Get off your back!
- Four.

505
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,526
- Get up! Off your back.
- Five.

506
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,196
- Get to your base.
- That's three near falls.

507
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,738
Red.

508
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,450
Come on, Mo! Break the hand.

509
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,036
One escape. Green.

510
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,141
Good! Good!

511
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,519
Two! Takedown, green. One.

512
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,520
Keep him down.

513
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,711
Two.

514
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,713
- Three.
- Lift the head.

515
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,715
- Four.
- Lift the head.

516
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,652
Five.

517
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,678
That's it! That's it!
Right there!

518
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,933
Winner is green.

519
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,107
Let me get a shrimp-fried rice.

520
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,254
What size you want?

521
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,613
Let me get a... small.

522
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,366
Gotta watch that weight, right?

523
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,393
Tell you what, you don't
appreciate your own room

524
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,544
until you share a cell
with a mental case.

525
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,089
This one foster home, I had to
share a room with six kids.

526
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,009
- Place smelled like shit.
- Yeah, well...

527
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,221
Juan know he owe me, so...

528
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,807
You working for him again?

529
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,895
You stupid? Nah.

530
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:30,938
Working for him?

531
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,500
This is just like payback.

532
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,193
Know what I mean? Back pay.

533
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,196
I'm gonna save up
a little bit...

534
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,905
then I'm out.

535
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,619
- Where you going?
- North Carolina.

536
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,514
- Aunt Keisha's?
- You remember her?

537
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,290
She still got that crazy dog?

538
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,227
- Russell? Russell wasn't crazy.
- That dog was definitely crazy.

539
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,771
He tried to bite my arm.
I still got the marks.

540
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,340
'Cause you and your cousins
used to try to ride his ass.

541
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,635
Remember that one time
we pinned his ears back?

542
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,512
And you wonder why he bit you.
Shit.

543
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,057
Even a dog got some pride.

544
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,733
We should've never
came back here.

545
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,281
Shit don't always work out
the way it's supposed to.

546
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,126
My boy Jay get out, we gonna
open this car wash...

547
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,520
down in Greensboro.

548
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,338
- For real?
- Yeah.

549
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,050
Jay know the owner.

550
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,658
Car wash been sitting empty
at the dude's gas station.

551
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,826
We gonna go 50-50
on the whole thing.

nobody's bitch.

554
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,442

00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,513
I had a clean record.

584
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,242
Nah.

585
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,264
They match the best with the worst
records in the first round.

586
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,582
This kid come in knowing
he got one shot.

587
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,711

motherfucker did not want to drown.

messing with the king.

Ain't no punk-ass boss

So my girl going to playoffs.

617
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,443
Go in there and get my smokes.

618
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,292
I don't see none in here.

619
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,882
You practicing that bear hug?

Yeah.

621
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,598
So, what you waiting for?

622
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,361
What?

623
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,571
Nothing.

624
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,037
Go ahead, set up.

625
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,193
Uh-uh. Nah, nah, nah, look.

626
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,302
You can't do nothing.

627
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,387
Pin this arm. Let me see.

628
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,056
Grab me.

629
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,143
Pop the arm.

630
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,313
Gonna pin his down...

631
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,148
and drive through.

632
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,191
You feel me?

633
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,575
Go ahead.

634
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,036
Sit down.

635
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,110
They better have wrestling
teams in Greensboro.

636
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,574
Let's try again.

637
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,371
Come on.

638
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,456
In a minute.

639
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,219
We gotta paint that car
wash something fresh.

640
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,850
Think people getting their car
washed somewhere 'cause of a color?

641
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,494
Hell, yeah.

642
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,622
Think people getting their car
washed in some boring joint?

643
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,666
You gotta get niggas
with the fly-ass rims,

644
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,085
dope-ass set of seats.
Detailing?

645
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,652
That's where the money at, yo.

646
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:42,989
All right.

647
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,096
All right, what color you
think get the most business?

648
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,705
That's easy. Gold.

649
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,169
- What?
- Where the fuck you get this from?

650
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,797
It's called vision, man.

651
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,609
- Ain't my fault you ain't got none.
- Watch out.

652
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,302
Oh, now you the one
with the ideas?

653
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,927
Hey!

654
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,516
I got the arm.

655
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,287
I got the arm.

656
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,497
- I got the head. Just giving me every...
- Oh!

657
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,607
Mo, on his back.

658
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,951
Let's go.

659
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,829
- Cover.
- Come on, Mo.

660
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,682
Take him down, Mo.

661
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,252
Mini Mo! Mini Mo! Mini Mo!

662
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,567
Yo, you heard?

663
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,236
Jorge's brother's bringing his
dirt bike after Coach's thing.

664
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,071
- Word?
- He gonna let me ride.

665
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,764
I'm gonna pop a wheelie
and everything.

666
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,784
What?

667
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,894
It's easy. I seen it on YouTube.
Just let go of the clutch and pop.

668
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,813
Yeah, all right.

669
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,899
- You down?
- No, I got plans.

670
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,610
Juan got you walking
his dogs again?

671
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,254
Hell, no.

672
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:06,800
"You better bring their asses back clean.
Don't want no shit on my Persians."

673
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,884
Yo, shut up.

674
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,745
I heard he brushes his dogs' teeth
with an electronic toothbrush.

675
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,644
- Yo, you ready?
- Give me a sec.

676
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,253
What you sulking
for, string bean?

677
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,524
Keep on drinking them protein shakes,
you'll get your glory soon enough.

678
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,715
It's Darrel, right?

679
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,593
I hear she takes after you.

680
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,281
It's in the blood, I guess.

681
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,326
Well, you're a
stronger man than me.

682
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,353
If my daughter wanted
to wrestle, I'd...

683
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,774
Where'd you wrestle at?

684
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,441
Five-six-nine.

685
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,196
I was at collegiate.
Probably before your time.

686
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,074
- Oh, yeah, probably.
- All right.

687
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,302
We gotta bounce.

688
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,514
I'm taking the team out for a
bite if you'd like to join us.

689
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,184
Unless, uh... there's
somewhere else you gotta be.

690
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,669
- Yeah, at work.
- I thought we was hanging out?

691
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,106
Maybe later.

692
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,133
- But you said we was...
- Plans change... Mo.

693
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,013
Besides, team gotta bond and all that.
Ain't that right, Coach?

694
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,556
Yeah.

695
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:14,974
You got it.

696
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,271
Call me later.

697
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,778
You gotta slow down.
You gonna crash.

698
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,716
- I got this.

699
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,634
- Oh!
- I told you.

700
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,428
- Game cheated, yo.
- I told you.

701
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:37,098
The problem is your driving's worse
than your wrestling. That's what's...

702
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,874
That's the real deal.

703
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,227
- Now what?
- You all in my ear.

704
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,480
- Get your stink breath out my face.
- Then do something.

705
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,941
We about to do a pull-up contest.
You coming?

706
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,569
Yo. I thought you was
gonna pop a wheelie.

707
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,737
Yeah, what happened?

708
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,946
We came for the show.

709
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,741
I told you my brother had a race.
I said that.

710
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,849
Whatever. Mo, you coming?

711
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,703

712
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,770
Ooh!

713
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,274
For real, though, we
make it to finals...

714
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,378
it's like a whole bunch
of recruiters that come.

715
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,546
Mm-hm.

716
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,089
- Bet you get a scholarship.
- Yeah!

717
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:14,385
Our little prince right here is
gonna get a free ride to college.

718
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,013
Whatever, man. Whatever, man.

719
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,098
You gonna be coming by
my place every weekend

720
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,850
trying to holla at
some college hos.

721
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,645
I will be prying them off my dick, bro.
'Sup, shorty?

722
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,170
You want a ride? Look... Oh.

723
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,483
My bad, he ain't take his meds.

724
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,109
Why you trying to
fuck up my game for?

725
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,885
What game? What game?

726
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,696
Exactly.

727
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,641
Anyway... there's mad women's
teams in college now.

728
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,018
You know?

729
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,855
What's up, beautiful?

730
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,108
No, no, we just chilling.

731
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,715
Where we going?

732
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,326
- Just... Just wait. Just wait.
- This where Juan do them dog fights?

733
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,785
Nah.

734
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,038
Nah, this the real shit.

735
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:26,207
All right, y'all. Tonight, we got
three-time Brownsville champ...

736
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,750
It's the real fight right here.

737
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,044
Keisha the Killer. Make
some noise for Keisha!

738
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,590
But don't be fooled,

739
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,260
'cause Miss Lala, she
may look skinny,

740
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,179
but she ain't come all the way
from Flatbush to eat shit.

741
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,681
Give it up for Miss Lala.

742
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,266
- Where's the money at?
- They boxers?

743
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,102
- Show your bets.
- Nah, kid, they fiercer than that.

744
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,354
All right, ladies,
center of the ring.

745
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:52,883
No biting, no scratching, no hair
pulling, no weapons. Got it?

746
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,229
Hey, hey! No hair pulling.
No hair pulling.

747
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,513
Ya'll give it up for
Keisha the Killer!

748
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,083
Go ahead, eat.

749
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,147
That's cool, I can't eat. We
got another match on Saturday.

750
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,024
Malik said there might
be college recruiters.

751
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,777
Oh! Well, if Malik say...

752
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,094
Stop playing.

753
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,471
They got women's teams now.

754
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,764
College cool...

755
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,560
and all that, until you get hit
with real responsibilities.

756
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,275
When your mom passed…

757
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,405
I did what I had to do. I
didn't have no choice.

758
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,512
Can't wait till I make my own
money, get my own place.

759
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:48,540
Well, if I could, I'd be in the
ring like them girls tonight.

760
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,978
Them girls on some other shit.

761
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,938
I think that one girl
got her jaw broke.

762
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,505
But you know how much
money they make?

763
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,381
Shit.

764
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,193
You said the money
was good with Juan.

765
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,345
You said you was saving
up for the car wash.

766
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,892
Yeah, well, Jay
didn't make parole.

767
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,853
So, unless I can come
up with his half...

768
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,856
and quick, ain't gonna
be no car wash.

769
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,340
Fuck, Monique!

770
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:25,052
Shit. The minute I get out, you
in my grill to take care of you.

771
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,079
- I told you it ain't like that.
- Did you make varsity or not?

772
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,892
- Yeah.
- Ain't none of them girls

773
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,810
training on no boys'
wrestling team.

774
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,437
You already had an advantage.

775
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,689
You working out with dudes,
and you training with me.

776
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,841
One fight, you can make as much as
I make in a week working the lot.

777
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,728
Fact is...

778
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,416
if I don't come up with ten Gs

779
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,069
in the next two weeks, owner gonna
sell the wash to somebody else. I'm...

780
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,655
I'm doing my part.

781
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,742
We both know what happen if
I keep working for Juan.

782
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,710
Fuck it!

783
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,799
Fuck it. Fuck it.

784
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,945
Fuck it. It's stupid.
I'm stupid.

785
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,029
I'm stupid.

786
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,889
- I ain't say...
- I shouldn't have took your ass there.

787
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,104
- I'm saying the money...
- Eat if you gonna eat. Shit. I gotta...

788
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,106
I gotta get back to the lot.

789
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,568
Damn! No wonder you
ain't make varsity.

790
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,862
You wouldn't be starting
if I hadn't let you win.

791
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,531
How come everybody saw
me take your ass down?

792
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,099
Watch his down. Chest
to back, and spin.

793
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,271
Oh, Juan buy you
those kicks, too?

794
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,499
At least my dad comes
to my matches.

795
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,544
Your mom's too busy taking her
clothes off for random niggas.

796
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,328
What?

797
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,766
What's wrong? What?
What, what, what?

798
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,334
She probably hungry.

799
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,297
Nyasa mom here.

800
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,052
What's wrong? You not
happy to see Mommy?

801
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,720
Just...

802
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,807
Here. I gotta use the toilet.

803
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,076
You should be happy for her.

804
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,872
She should be with her real mom.

805
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,594
Come on, Nicholas.
Come on, let's go.

806
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,804
Nice and easy.

807
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,454
Let's get this done.

808
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,207
Lower your anklets.

809
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,852
All right, Mo.

810
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:02,876
Shake hands.

811
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,095
Take a shot.

812
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,936
Get to your bridge! Build up!
Build up!

813
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,233
That's it. Get in there, Mo.

814
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,861
Where's that fire? Get in there.

815
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,090
Build up! Build up! Build up!

816
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,258
Build up!

817
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,079
Get up! Get off your back!
Off your back!

818
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,795
Shake hands.

819
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:50,675
Shake hands. Shake
the coaches' hands.

820
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,097
Hey!

821
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,601
What the hell
happened out there?

822
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,551
Let's go, Huskies!

823
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,178
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

824
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,846
Let's go, Hedgeman!

825
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,514
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

826
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,224
Let's go, Huskies!

827
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,833
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

828
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,383
Everybody allowed
to lose a match.

829
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,846
What's that corny
shit Coach say?

830
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,534
There's no such thing
as losing, it's just...

831
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,560
It's just winning and learning.

832
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,445
You know how many times my
father seen me wrestle?

833
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,408
You get used to it.

834
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,565
All right, y'all,
show your bets.

835
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,899
Where the money at?

836
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,300
You got money on the fat girl?

837
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,137
That girl can do damage.

838
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,240
Trust.

839
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,950
Where the money at? Come on.

840
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,017
Don't be cheap.

841
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,703
What, y'all sleeping?

842
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,186
How much we need
for the car wash?

843
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,958
You and me dump Juan and
get the fuck out of here.

844
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,401
The rules: no biting,
no scratching,

845
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,029
no weapons, no hair pulling.
Y'all got it?

846
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,657
Couple of fights...

847
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,242
we'll be good.

848
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,208
All right, ladies,
center of the ring.

849
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,965
Jab. Jab, jab.

850
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,696
That's your combination.
Jab straight up.

851
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,657
Just when they think
they got you, mix it up.

852
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,558
Why do that when I
can just do this?

853
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,245
This ain't wrestling. Shoot
on somebody like that,

854
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,749
you gonna get your
grill knocked out.

855
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,273
Mo!

856
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,878
Straight. Jab, jab, straight.

857
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:59,214
- Come on.
- Jab, jab, straight. Jab, jab, straight.

858
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,175
One, two. Uppercut, uppercut.

859
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,801
Get in there. Grab
my fucking neck.

860
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,763
Grab. Grab the neck. All right, come on.
One, two.

861
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,040
Hey!

862
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,000
What the hell are you doing?

863
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,063
It's all right, I got it, Coach.

878
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,158
I told you to keep your phone on vibrate.
You about to miss the fight.

879
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,059

01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,028
What you talking about?
I had double unders.

884
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,803
All right, y'all.

885
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:31,640
So, tonight, we got a few virgin

886
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,059

887
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,186

Let's do it.

888
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,298
Who the girl?

889
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,945
Juan cousin. Don't worry, she
ain't got nothing on you.

890
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,905
- All right, ladies.
- Show her who the queen.

891
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,347
To the middle.

892
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,684
Y'all know what
time it is, right?

893
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,480
Gonna need y'all to try to make

01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,149

So, dap it up.

01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,914
Come on, Naya.

899
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,339
Come on, Naya. Quit
playing with her.

900
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,360
- There it is.
- Get up, get up, get up.

901
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,677
What you running for?

902
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,393
Yeah!

903
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,815
Mo. Mo.

904
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,322
You lost your fucking mind?

905
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,449
What, you stalking me now?

906
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,993
- What's wrong with you?
- With me?

907
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:55,998
The hell you doing in there, Mo?
We're one match away from finals.

908
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,435
What's Coach gonna say
when he sees your face?

909
01:03:58,459 --> 01:03:59,710
Coach not gonna say shit.

910
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,105
'Cause Coach not gonna know shit.
I swear, O,

911
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,024
- you open your mouth...
- What'd I tell you?

912
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,550
Them girls ain't got
nothing on you.

913
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,890
What up, O?

914
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,396
You see your girl
get real in there?

915
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,647
Yeah.

916
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,440
She did good.

917
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,739
Anyways, I gotta go.

918
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:30,449
You be safe.

919
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,725
What'd I tell you?

920
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:41,210
I didn't say shit. He
came here by hisself.

921
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,254
Besides, he's not
gonna say nothing.

922
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:46,716
Where's the money?

923
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,763
Go ahead, feel that.

924
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:57,934
Five hundred?

925
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,438
- You said winner take a G.
- What you want it for?

926
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,943
You lucky he even let
you have a fight.

927
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,863
It was just a warm-up.

928
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:13,826
I'll tell you when you
ready for the big leagues.

929
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,872
Black Moon.

930
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,957
Das EFX.

931
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,920
Special Ed? This shit
is old as me, yo.

932
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,380
Who you think put me onto it?

933
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,528
You're a little
mini-me, you know that?

934
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:33,012
Malik call me Mini Mo.

935
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,556
"Malik call me Mini Mo.

936
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,536
- Malik say I'm fine."
- Ain't even like that.

937
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,062
"Malik say I'm fine."

938
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,942
Whatever. He got a girl anyway.

939
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,033
Hey, listen.

940
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,161
Fuck Malik.

941
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,373
You gonna be a legend.

942
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:02,625
And not just in some...

943
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,379
high school yearbook.

944
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,259
Make a name out here, ain't
nobody gonna fuck with you.

945
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:18,807
Come here.

946
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,850
Come here.

947
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,396
Gotta teach you how to duck.

948
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,533
You can leave now.

949
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:37,886
Ay... ¿Que te pasó?

950
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,972
Get the fuck out!

951
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,349
Lucila wants you off the team.

952
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:45,251
You and I both know you didn't get
punched in the face wrestling.

953
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,563
Now, tell me what's going
on with your father,

954
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,607
or I'll pull you off
this team myself.

955
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:53,592
Ain't got nothing to do with him.
I got beef with some girl.

956
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:05,354
My dad runs one of Juan's parking lots.
I chill with him sometimes.

957
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,233
He got no place to live,
so he sleeps there.

958
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:14,447
This girl called him
homeless, and...

959
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:16,991
I lost my shit.

960
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:24,123
Just 'cause I messed up,
it ain't the team's fault.

961
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,959
I'm gonna win. We
going to finals.

962
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:48,915
He's stalling.

963
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,584
He's gonna spank him, bro.

964
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:53,027
We can bet money, bro.

965
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,713
He got taken down.

966
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,681
This is why I don't
watch white porn.

967
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,975
You are not watching
half the fight, Mo.

968
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,060
We can put money on the fight.

969
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,461
Chris been watching
the whole thing.

970
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:14,215
What's up with you?
That time of the month?

971
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,342
Why you all...?

972
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,805
Come on. Come on.

973
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,977
How long you been wrestling for?

974
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,604
Since I was ten.

975
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,565
Uncle wanted me to start
boxing, actually.

976
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,860
I got punched in the mouth
one time, and I was like...

977
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:36,755
"No, thank you."

978
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,635
My nickname was Wrong Way, because
every time a fight broke out,

979
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:45,430
all my friends running towards the
shit, I'm running the other way.

980
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,582
They got a medical term for that.
It's called no balls-itis.

981
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,753
Yeah, well... when my
dad came back around...

982
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,631
I almost got thrown
off the team.

983
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,444
Tried to work the corners
with him and be tough...

984
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,971
You, dealing? I'd have
loved to see that.

985
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,950
If it wasn't for Coach riding
my ass, showing up to my house,

986
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,142
I would've dropped out.

987
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:09,395
- Coach pay you to tell me that?
- What?

988
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,040
Fuck, no.

989
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,959
You sound like one of
them guest speakers.

990
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,694
"Stay in school, kids.
Don't do drugs."

991
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:20,906
Yeah, well... would've been
one corny ass gangster.

992
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,136
Damn, what do all these
schools want you for?

993
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,680
- These the good schools.
- 'Cause I put in the work.

994
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,432
Not like you. Look at yo ass.
You just faking.

995
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,226
You think you a real wrestler.

996
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,043
- Whatever.
- You think you're a wrestler.

997
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,047

- I thought you had more class.
- Ain't what you think. Nathalie.

1015
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:07,739
It ain't what you think.

1016
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,075
- How about what I see?
- It ain't mean nothing.

1017
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,869
- What are you talking about?
- We don't mean nothing.

1018
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:13,912
Nathalie, just...

1019
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,667
- You fucked him?
- Move out the way.

1020
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,834
You know she's pregnant?

1021
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,318
- I'm not playing.
- She was right.

1022
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,280
You'll let anybody fuck you.

1023
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,306
I'm ready for the real shit.

1024
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,707
Gotta get the fuck out of here.

1025
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,089
Watch these girls and learn.

1026
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:01,233
The underhook. Fake and set single.
Snap down.

1027
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,379
Good. Shuck. Release
that forearm.

1028
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,155
Circle. Good, do it again.

1029
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,175
Good.

1030
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,635
All right. One, two.

1031
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,339
That's not an underhook. You
holding hands with him, Tyson.

1032
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:28,010
Who taught you to shuck?
Do it again.

1033
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:29,678
Actually, Coach...

1034
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:35,100
I'm kinda having some...
female issues.

1035
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,105
You worried about weight?

1036
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,649
Nah, I'll be good if I don't eat.
I just...

1037
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,076
What color do you like?

1038
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:39,307
I'm not allowed to have
nails 'cause of wrestling.

1039
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:40,541
I make nice for you.

1040
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,168
Good luck for tomorrow.

1041
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,068
How come you never
had your own babies?

1042
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,532
God no...

1043
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:18,954
God wouldn't let me.

1044
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:33,736
Okay, listen up. Remember...

1045
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,572
there's no such thing as losing.

1046
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,306
There's only winning...

1047
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,242
and learning.

1048
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:42,311
I want you to take pride
in how far you've come,

1049
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,747
and have faith in
how far you can go.

1050
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:46,499
All right? Bring it in.

1051
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,691
Give me some love.

1052
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,295
- Winners never quit.
- Quitters never win.

1053
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,546
- One, two, three!
- Hedgeman!

1054
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,047
- Three, two, one!
- Huskies!

1055
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,551
Hedgeman High is happy
to welcome Garner

1056
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,386
for the last match
of the season.

1057
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,221
I know you're all excited.

1058
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,307
We'll be getting started
in a few minutes.

1059
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,707

01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,420
I'm counting on you.

1062
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:14,718
Get the hand-off! Look away!

1063
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:19,389
We've got a takedown. One. Two.

1064
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:41,912
You got it! You got this! You got this!
You got this!

1065
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:45,499
Okay, let's go. Top
man, work something.

1066
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,835
I know shit got messed
up the other night.

1067
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,173
I crossed the line. Big time.

1068
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:55,217
We family now.

1069
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,512
I got a family.

1070
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,264
Really?

1071
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,910
What kind of father does
that to his daughter's face?

1072
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,978
What kind of father ditches
his kid for college?

1073
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,231
Look away. Rip 'em off.
There you go.

1074
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,151
That's a warning.

1075
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:15,862
Better work something, top man.

1076
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,739
That's one.

1077
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:19,323
Two.

1078
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:20,908
Three.

1079
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:22,785
Four.

1080
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,415
That's two near falls.

1081
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,710
Continue to work.

1082
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,546
Come on, ref, make 'em wrestle!

1083
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:36,966
One.

1084
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:38,676
Two.

1085
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,344
Three.

1086
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:43,265
Two near falls.

1087
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:48,520
Go, bottom man. Try
to work something.

1088
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,940
Don't give nothing away.

1089
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:55,527
No, go to your base.
Control his hands.

1090
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,449
Get off your back!

1091
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,618
- Off your back!
- One.

1092
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:04,410
Two.

1093
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:05,954
Three.

1094
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,080
Four.

1095
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,166
Five.

1096
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,712
Hold on three, top man.

1097
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,136
You lose your match, we
ain't going to finals.

1098
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,140
Then you'd better win.

1099
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:39,988
- What you need all that for?
- I can't go back there now.

1100
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,104
All right, let's go!

1101
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,816
- Go ahead, warm up.
- What about my shit?

1102
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,384
What? It's fine.

1103
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,679
- Somebody gonna steal it.
- It's fine.

1104
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:07,015
Go ahead, warm up. Go ahead.
Get in there.

1105

their dad, maybe for like...

1187
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,410
five minutes on their
birthday or something, but...

1188
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,288
I was living with mine.

1189
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,604
I wanted one of those
Razor scooters so bad.

1190
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:36,339

one home for me.

1192
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:44,848
Told me... to make sure I only
rode them in Tilden Projects.

1193
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:46,933
But I was mad proud.

1194
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:49,060
Rode that shit everywhere.

1195
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,022

at Marcus Garvey...

1196
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,401

1197
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:59,404
Said he carved his
initials in the handle.

1198
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:03,449
Seen 'em, too.

1199
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:08,663
I told him my dad bought it
new and would fuck him up.

1200
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:12,333
Kid started stalking me.

1201
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:14,961
One day, he seen
me with D, and...

1202
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,464
ratted him out to the cops.

1203
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,636
They found out he'd been
robbing people for Juan.

1204
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,225
You were a kid, Mo.

1205
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,605

for your father.

Tanya's room as long as you want.

1210
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:19,692
She sleeps in my
mom's bed anyway.

01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:04,945
And...

1214
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,787
you're the only foster
mom never kicked me out.

1215
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,500
And...

1216
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:31,597
You be a good girl now.

1217
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:52,285
Quit crying. Come on.
Why you always crying?

1218
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:56,289
Come on, stop crying. Stop crying.
Stop crying.

1219
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:57,664
Shh, shh, shh.

1220
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:01,627
I know. I know. It's all right.

1221
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:03,462
Okay.

1222
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:31,324
She not only let herself down,
she let the whole team down.

1223
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,536
So, I put it to the
group to decide.

1224
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:39,040
Should she be suspended
from finals or not?

1225
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,048
Omari had't won for her, we
wouldn't even be going to finals.

1226
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,674
Yeah, that's true.

1227
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:51,343
Yeah.

1228
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,974
Everybody has a right
to make a mistake.

1229
01:29:57,934 --> 01:29:59,018
That was a big one.

1230
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,814
But we gotta think about
what's best for the team.

1231
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,150
It's our first year
going to finals.

1232
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:10,405
And all respect to Omari
for stepping up, but...

1233
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,366
Mo's been killing it all season.

1234
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:20,997
Mo...

1235
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,126
you have anything to add?

1236
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:34,429
I'm gonna do whatever's
best for the team.

1237
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:37,056
Whatever y'all think that is.

1238
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:44,814
Let's put it to a vote. All in
favor of Mo starting on Friday.

1239
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:06,812
Mo.

1240
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:08,588
Mo.

1241
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,381
Monique.

1242
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,360
- You got my bag?
- Why would I?

1243
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:16,053
'Cause you stupid. Check yours.
Mine is missing.

1244
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:23,579
Yeah. You lucky I asked. Would've
had to save your ass. Again.

1245
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:26,355
You lucky you got big feet, or I
would've worn 'em anyway. Now move.

1246
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,235
- Hey, where you going?
- I forgot my bag inside.

1247
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:34,279
Mo.

1248
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,448
Nice hair.

1249
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:38,283
Thanks.

1250
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,429
Whoo!

1251
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:42,806
Get it, girl!

1252
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,642
Girl, this ain't a runway.
Get out of here. Hurry up.

1253
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:00,889
Monique.

1254
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:04,935
You got a match?

1255
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:12,276
Now you the one hard to reach.

1256
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:16,364
Fame getting to you?

1257
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:21,536
Look, I know shit got fucked up.

1258
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,207
I felt bad leaving
after the fight.

1259
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:28,792
For real.

1260
01:32:30,753 --> 01:32:31,753
But you...

1261
01:32:32,004 --> 01:32:36,175
You know I couldn't get caught
near all that. Mo. Mo, I...

1262
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:39,095
I tried to double our earnings.

1263
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,639
I was up for a
little while, too.

1264
01:32:42,014 --> 01:32:43,766
Mo. Monique.

1265
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:48,062
I just... I just got excited.

1266
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:49,980
That's all.

1267
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,942
Seeing you in the
ring, on that mat...

1268
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:57,238
it reminded me of me.
All that flying.

1269
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,324
You could do
something with that.

1270
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:03,326
I know.

1271
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,794
How about we start
our own thing?

1272
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,549
Dude I know, he got
a gym, and we...

1273
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:18,026
Mo.

1274
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:19,050
Monique.

1275
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:20,803
Oh, it's like that now?

1276
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:24,616
Too good for your own pops now?

1277
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:27,142
Jamal here?

1278
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:29,913
All right. Chad? Where's Chad?

1279
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:32,690
- Yo, we gonna hook in.
- All right, so...

1280
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:37,254
we got one, two, three,
four, five, six,

1281
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:40,531
seven, eight, nine.
Where's Tyson?

1282
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:43,034
Somebody call and see if
he's coming on his own.

1283
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,453
I'm not waiting more
than five minutes.

1284
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,002
Dad.

1285
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,216
All right, don't...

1286
01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:01,886
Don't go soft on me now.

1287
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:14,106
How long you had my notebook?

1288
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:36,021
- Y'all ready to go to finals?
- We're going to finals!

1289
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:37,505
