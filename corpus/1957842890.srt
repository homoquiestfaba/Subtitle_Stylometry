1
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
I DON'T KNOW,
IT MAY BE A LOCAL LEGEND.

2
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,400
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT,
BUT--

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
NO!

4
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,800
ANOTHER HUGE
TIDAL WAVE HAS HIT LAND,

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,200
THIS TIME
IN PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO.

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
WHAT YOU WILL SEE
IS AMATEUR VIDEOTAPE

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
TAKEN LAST NIGHT
BY A SURVIVOR.

8
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
OUR ANN WINSLOW
IS ON THE SCENE.

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,800
FRANK, WORDS CANNOT
DESCRIBE THE DEVASTATION.

10
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
WHAT WE SEE HERE
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

11
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
10 DAYS AGO, A WAVE
DEVASTATED HONSHU, JAPAN.

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
THIS ONE WAS WORSE.

13
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
PEOPLE ARE SCARED

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
AND STARTING TO ASK
WILL THERE BE MORE?

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
AND, IF SO, WHERE?

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
THANK YOU, ANN,
FOR THAT REPORT.

17
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
WE HAVE
THIS INFORMATION NOW,

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
COMING FROM
THE TSUNAMI WARNING CENTER.

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,800
A TSUNAMI HAS BEEN GENERATED
WHICH COULD CAUSE DAMAGE

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
TO PORTIONS
OF THE PACIFIC COAST.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
TSUNAMI WAVE HEIGHTS
CANNOT BE PREDICTED

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,800
AND MAY BE AS A RESULT OF WAVES
WHICH COULD BE DANGEROUS

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTER
THE INITIAL WAVE ARRIVAL.

24
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
HEY!

25
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
HEY, WHERE WERE YOU?

26
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,000
I LOOKED
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WHERE WERE YOU?

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
BIG UPSET WHEN YOU GO
WITHOUT HIM, DOC.

29
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
HEY, HE WASN'T AROUND.

30
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
I LOOKED FOR YOU, CODY,
HONEST.

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
SO WHAT'S IT DOING
OUT THERE TODAY?

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
SAME AS ALWAYS.
KEEPING ME HAPPY.

33
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
HEY, DOC, YOU'RE
A SCIENTIST, RIGHT?

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
NOT ANYMORE.

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
THESE TIDAL WAVES, MAN.

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,200
THINK YOU COULD, LIKE,
TELL IF ONE WAS COMING?

37
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,600
NO ONE CAN, CHICK,
NOT REALLY.

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE
THE ULTIMATE KICK,

39
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,800
IS TO SURF ONE OF THEM.

40
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
HEY, CODY! COME HERE.

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
COME HERE!

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
HEY, I LOOKED FOR YOU,
I DID.

43
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,400
COME ON.

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
YOU HUNGRY?

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
CONFOUNDING THE PUNDITS

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,800
WHO ARGUED AGAINST THE MOVE

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,400
INTO TREASURY BONDS
AND NOTES,

48
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
DIVIDENDS ARE MUCH HIGHER
THAN EXPECTED,

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,200
THE SELECTED COMMODITIES

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,200
CURRENTLY UP
FROM A YEAR AGO.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,800
THIS IS AN AREA
WELL WORTH A SECOND LOOK.

52
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
FOREIGN STOCK MARKETS

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
STILL SHOW LITTLE CHANGE
FROM YESTERDAY,

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
BUT LOCAL EARNINGS ARE UP.

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,600
I KNEW THAT.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,200
THE WORLD'S TOP
DEEP WATER SPECIALISTS

57
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
HAVE BEEN CALLED TOGETHER
TO MEET HERE

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,600
AT THE FAMED AQUATRONICS
RESEARCH INSTITUTE,

59
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
FUNDED IN PART

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,400
BY WASHINGTON'S NATIONAL
SCIENCE FOUNDATION.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
NOW, WITH THE SECOND WAVE
HITTING,

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
THIS MEETING BECOMES
EVEN MORE URGENT.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
OH. DR. AGAMO.
DR. AGAMO, EXCUSE ME.

64
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
UH, YES.

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
YES. COULD YOU TELL US,
AS A SEISMOLOGIST,

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
UNDERWATER EARTHQUAKES

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
ARE THE CAUSE
OF THESE TIDAL WAVES?

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,200
THE TSUNAMI. UH,
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL.

69
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,000
WELL,
2 IN A ROW LIKE THIS,

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ISN'T THAT UNUSUAL?

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
YES, YES,
MOST UNUSUAL.

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
BUT--DOCTOR, EXCUSE ME.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,600
THE INVITED SCIENTISTS
ARE BEING MET

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,600
BY THE INSTITUTE'S

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
ASSOCIATE RESEARCH
DIRECTOR...

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
DR. WAHL?

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,000
I'M MARLAN CLARK.
THIS IS FRANK BRISICK.

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE I WAS?

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,200
OH, WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,600
MORE OR LESS.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
WELL, YOU CAN
GO BACK AND TELL THEM

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,400
I'M NOT INTERESTED.
I'M...BUSY.

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,800
RIGHT.

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
SURF'S UP.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,200
GO AWAY, FELLAS.

87
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
I MEAN IT.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
YOU'RE COMING WITH US,
DR. WAHL.

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
AND WE MEAN IT.

90
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,000
YEAH.

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,000
JOHN WAHL?

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,000
YEAH.

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
PUT ON YOUR SEAT BELT.

94
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
TSUNAMI STAFF,

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
REPORT TO AREA 6, SECURITY.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
UH, LET ME JUST SEE
WHO'S HERE REAL QUICK.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
"DR. HIROSHI AGAMO...
DR. JULES BERNARD."

98
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
GOOD.

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
"DR. JOHN WAHL?"

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,600
WHY THEY HAULED HIM IN
ON THIS I'LL NEVER KNOW.

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
THE MAN'S BEEN
OUT OF IT FOR YEARS.

103
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
THEY SHOULD
HAVE LEFT HIM OUT.

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH,
DON'T YOU THINK?

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
COME ON. HE WAS THE TOP
IN HIS FIELD, AND HE QUIT.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
YEAH, B-BUT THE MAN
MADE SOME, UH,

107
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
PRETTY IMPORTANT
CONTRIBUTIONS IN HIS DAY.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
I HATE QUITTERS!

109
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600
DR. WAHL.

110
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
JULES BERNARD.

111
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
YOU'RE ACTUALLY HERE.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,200
YES, SIR. INDEED I AM.
I...I AM HERE.

113
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,400
DR. JESSICA WEAVER,
JOHN WAHL.

114
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,200
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

115
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
NICE TO MEET YOU,
DR. WEAVER.

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
PLEASE STAND BY
FOR AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE.

117
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,200
TSUNAMI STAFF, REPORT
TO AREA 6, SECURITY.

118
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,800
SHE'S CHIEF
OCEANOGRAPHER

119
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,000
AT AQUATRONICS.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
SHE HOLDS 2 MASTERS
AND A Ph.D. IN HER FIELD.

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
THE NAVY PUT HER HERE.

122
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
AND SHE'S STILL
A LIEUTENANT COMMANDER.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WELL, MAYBE NEXT TIME
I BETTER SALUTE, HUH?

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SECURITY, AREA 5.
IMMEDIATELY.

125
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,800
I'M EDGAR PURCELL
FROM THE NSA...

126
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,000
I should have known

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,200
you'd be here.

128
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,400
I DON'T KNOW ALL OF YOU
PERSONALLY,

129
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
BUT, UH,
I KNOW YOUR REPUTATIONS.

130
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE,

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,600
AS OF TODAY, 2 WAVES
HAVE KILLED 97 PEOPLE

132
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
AND CAUSED WORLDWIDE DAMAGE

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
ESTIMATED AT OVER
A BILLION DOLLARS.

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,400
OUR GOVERNMENT...WANTS
TO KNOW WHAT CAUSED THEM.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,200
WAS IT A, UH...

136
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,800
SERIES OF TECTONIC
PLATE SHIFTS, DR. AGAMO?

137
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,000
MAYBE CAUSED BY OCEAN FLOOR
THERMAL VENTING DISTURBANCES?

138
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,200
OR ARE THERE
SOME KIND OF, UH,

139
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
WAVE RESONANCE PROGRESSIONS
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT,

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,400
SOMETHING WITH
A MATHEMATICAL SEQUENCE TO IT

141
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,200
THAT WE CAN PREDICT?

142
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,400
PREDICT?

143
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
NOT THIS, NO.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,200
NO IS A WORD
WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

145
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,600
WHAT WE WANT,
WHAT WE NEED, SOON...

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
IS SOMETHING DEFINITE.

147
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,200
THE JULY 1st
OFFSHORE DISTURBANCE

148
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,400
WAS GENERATED IN THE AREA
MARKED IN RED.

149
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
95 MINUTES LATER,

150
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,400
A 30-FOOT TSUNAMI
HIT HONSHU, JAPAN.

151
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,800
THE JULY 10th DISTURBANCE
WAS A RICHTER SCALE 6.5,

152
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,400
GENERATED...HERE.

153
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
ONLY 55 MINUTES LATER,

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
A TSUNAMI HIT
PUERTO VALLARTA,

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,200
AND THE WAVE WAS SEVERAL
FEET LARGER.

156
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,800
WE CAN CONFIRM THAT

157
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,600
THE WAVES WEREN'T CAUSED BY
VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.

158
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
AN ATOMIC BOMB?

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
SEISMIC READINGS ON BOTH
DON'T INDICATE A BOMB.

160
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
IN ANY CASE, ONE ALONE
COULDN'T DO THIS.

161
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
JIMMY DOOLITTLE
THOUGHT IT COULD.

162
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
STANLEY!

163
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
YOUNG JOHN.

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
GOD, I MISS SEEING YOU.

165
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,400
HEY, I DIDN'T SEE
YOUR NAME ON THE LIST.

166
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,000
WELL, MY LIST.
I PUT IT TOGETHER.

167
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,400
HOW'S THE FISHING?

168
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,200
HOW'S THE SURFING?
GREAT.

169
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
YOU MENTIONED A BOMB,
DR. SCHIFF?

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,600
NOT JUST A BOMB.
THE BOMB.

171
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,000
2 OF 'EM.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,600
THE WAR
WAS WINDING DOWN.

173
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
WE WERE GONNA WIN.
BUT AT WHAT COST?

174
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
JIMMY DOOLITTLE HAD
DONE HIS RAID ON TOKYO.

175
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
PRETTY SHAKY
OPERATION, BUT, UH,

176
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
PSYCHOLOGICALLY...

177
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,000
HE KNEW WE HAD THE BOMB.

178
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,600
HIS IDEA WAS TO DROP ONE
IN TOKYO BAY.

179
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
GIVE THE JAPANESE PEOPLE

180
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
SOMETHING THEY WOULD
UNDERSTAND, SOMETHING

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,200
THAT WOULD REALLY
GET THEIR ATTENTION.

182
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
A TSUNAMI.

183
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,800
DID THE GENERAL HAVE PLANS
FOR A SECOND BOMB?

184
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
OH, YEAH, HE SURE DID.

185
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,800
HE WANTED TO DESTROY JAPAN'S
MOST ENDURING SYMBOL...

186
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
MT. FUJI.

187
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
WE'RE IGNORING METEORS.

188
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,000
JOHN LOUIS SAID THAT
MOST OF THEM HIT THE OCEAN.

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
HE RAN COMPUTER SIMULATIONS

190
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,200
ON THE IMPACT TSUNAMIS
CREATED THAT WAY

191
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
AND GOT AN AVERAGE
CASUALTY READING OF

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
100 KILLED, 1,000 INJURED.

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
ON TOP OF WHICH,
ANY COLLISION LIKE THAT

194
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
GIVES YOU A RICHTER SCALE
READING THAT LOOKS EXACTLY--

195
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,800
I-I'M SORRY,
BUT I DON'T BUY IT.

196
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,600
NOT THAT I WANT TO DISAGREE
WITH LOUIS. HE'S GOOD.

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,800
IN FACT, I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED
THAT HE'S NOT IN ON THIS.

198
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
BUT MY POINT IS THAT
THERE HAVE BEEN 2 WAVES,

199
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
ALMOST IN A ROW.

200
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,800
THAT IS WAY BEYOND
ANY PROBABILITY SCALE.

201
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
SO WHAT'S YOUR THEORY,
DR. WAHL?

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
THE BOMB?

203
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,400
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

204
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
WITH ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUY AS MANY BOMBS

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,400
AS THEY WANT
WITH CHANGE TO SPARE.

206
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,200
I GUESS THAT
LEAVES YOU OUT.

207
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,800
THANKS.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
LOOK, YOU PEOPLE WANT MY HELP,
I'M GLAD TO HELP,

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
BUT THIS
IS A WASTE OF TIME.

210
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,800
YOU WANT METEORS...FINE.

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,000
FIRST, GET THE GOVERNMENT
TO DO A SATELLITE SCAN

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
OF THE OCEAN FLOOR FOR ANY
NEW IMPACT CRATERS.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
ME? I GOTTA GO, UH,

214
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
DISPLACE A LITTLE WATER
OF MY OWN.

215
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,800
AQUATRONICS IS
A NONSMOKING FACILITY.

216
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,400
NO SMOKING, PLEASE.

217
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
CHARMING.

218
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
YEAH. TALK TO ME.

219
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
MR. WAHL,

220
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I'M NOT SURPRISED

221
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
THEY BROUGHT YOU
IN ON THIS.

222
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
IN ON WHAT?
WHO IS THIS?

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
METEORS! THAT IDIOT.

224
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,200
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

225
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
THAT IDEA OF
GENERAL DOOLITTLE'S.

226
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,200
IMAGINE
WHAT A TIDAL WAVE

227
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
COULD HAVE DONE

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
FOR OUR BOYS ON
D-DAY AT NORMANDY.

229
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
THINK OF
ALL THE LIVES SAVED.

230
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
YOU'RE RIGHT.

231
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,000
TOO BAD WE CAN'T
CONTROL MOTHER NATURE.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
WATCHING THE NEWS?

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
WE CAN.

234
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,400
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

235
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,800
ARE YOU LAUGHING?

236
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
ALL RIGHT, WISE ASS,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

237
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,000
NOTHING...YET.

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,400
MR. WAHL...MR. WAHL...

239
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
WHAT?!

240
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
YOUR BEER'S
GETTING WARM.

241
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,200
VALERIE, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN

242
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
AND JOINING US TODAY.

243
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,200
AND FOR YOU THINKING
ABOUT THAT FIRST HOME,

244
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
MARTY HAS SOME VERY GOOD TIPS

245
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY
TUNED FOR. MARTY?

246
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
WE INTERRUPT
THIS PROGRAM TO BRING YOU

247
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
A SPECIAL REPORT.

248
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,200
20 MINUTES AGO,

249
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,400
A 40-FOOT TIDAL WAVE HIT
THE NORTH SHORE OF HAWAII.

250
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,600
REPORTS INDICATE THE WAVE
WASHED 1/4 OF A MILE INLAND,

251
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,400
LEAVING VAST DEVASTATION
IN ITS WAKE.

252
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,200
WE'LL BRING YOU A LIVE REPORT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

253
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
WE NOW RETURN TO YOUR REGULARLY

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING.
STAY TUNED...

255
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,800
I TOLD THEM

256
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,200
NOT TO PUT YOUR PHONE CALLS
THROUGH TO ME ANYMORE, ALAN.

257
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,800
BECAUSE WE HAVE
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

258
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,800
WELL, ALAN, I REALLY
DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK.

259
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
ALAN...ALAN, THAT'S WHY
THEY CALL IT A DIVORCE.

260
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
DAMN IT, ALAN,
I SAID NO!

261
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
UH, YEAH, HI.
IT'S JOHN WAHL--

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
SIT! CODY!

263
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,000
UM...JUST A MINUTE.

264
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
HI.

265
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,200
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THE HONOR?

266
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,600
UH, CODY, THIS IS

267
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER
JESSICA WEAVER

268
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY--
STAY HERE, CODY! SIT!

269
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,600
I'M ALSO VERY BUSY,
DR. WAHL.

270
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
EDGAR IS CLIMBING--
HAWAII.

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,400
I NEED TO GET BACK
INTO AQUATRONICS.

273
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,600
REALLY? YOU WERE
THERE EARLIER.

274
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
YOU DIDN'T SEEM
TO LIKE IT MUCH.

275
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
C-CODY!

276
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
RIGHT AFTER I GOT
BACK THIS MORNING,

277
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
I GOT A PHONE CALL.

278
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
A MAN. HE MENTIONED
DOOLITTLE'S PLAN,

279
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
AND THEN THIS ARRIVED.

280
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
WHAT'S THIS
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

281
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
OH, COME ON,
DR. WEAVER.

282
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
NO, YOU COME ON,
DR. WAHL!

283
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
YOU COULD HAVE SENT
THIS TO YOURSELF.

284
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
THEN I CAME STRAIGHT HERE

285
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY PERFECT
CHARACTER WITNESS!

286
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,400
WHY NOT?! IT WOULD BE
THE SMART THING TO DO.

287
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,800
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'RE NOT DUMB.

288
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,600
DR. WEAV--MA'AM!

289
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
THOSE WAVES ARE
BEING MANUFACTURED.

290
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I BELIEVE IT,
YOU ALMOST BELIEVE IT,

291
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,600
AND THAT'S THE REAL REASON
THAT CONFERENCE WAS CALLED.

292
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
THAT'S WHY EDGAR PURCELL

293
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
AND THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY

294
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,600
NEEDED ALL OF US
IN THE SAME ROOM.

295
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I SUPPOSED YOU'D
BETTER COME IN.

296
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
IS, UH,
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

297
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
WELL...HE'S
ALREADY THERE.

298
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
CODY!

299
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
COFFEE?

300
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,800
UH...YEAH, YEAH.

301
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
NICE PLACE.

302
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,800
SOME OTHER TIME, WAHL.

303
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,400
YOU AND MR. PURCELL

304
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
SEEM TO HAVE A VERY
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.

305
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
YOU NOTICED, HUH?

306
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I THINK EVERYBODY NOTICED.

307
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
SO YOU THINK

308
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,800
WHOEVER CALLED YOU WAS
IN THAT ROOM WITH US.

309
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I'D PUT MY MONEY ON IT.

310
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
REALLY? SO WHO IS IT?
BERNARD?

311
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
NO. HE'S TOO NICE.

312
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
HO HO.

313
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,600
WELL, THAT ELIMINATES
HIM RIGHT AWAY.

314
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,200
WHAT ABOUT SCHIFF?

315
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,000
YEAH, RIGHT. YOU'RE
TELLING ME THE MAN

316
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
WHO TAUGHT ME
MOST OF WHAT I KNOW

317
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
IS PULLING SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

318
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
YOU SAW HIM.

319
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
HE'S A STRAIGHT-
FROM-THE-SHOULDERS GUY.

320
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S 2 DOWN,

321
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
WHICH LEAVES AGAMO.

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
TOO DEDICATED.

323
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,200
HE'S THE CLASSIC
LABORATORY MOLE

324
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,800
WHO BLINKS AT NIGHT-LIGHTS.

325
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,800
THE MAN KNOWS A LOT ABOUT
DEEP CANYON THERMALS.

326
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
HIROSHI AGAMO'S BEEN
SURFING THAT HORSE

327
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS.

328
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
WHILE YOU ONLY SURF
THE REAL THING.

329
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,600
LOOK, DAMN IT,

330
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
ALL I'M TRYING
TO PROVE HERE--

331
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
NO, YOU LOOK!

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,400
NO, NO, NO, WHICH
LEAVES ONLY YOU.

333
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
AND YOU.

334
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
I THINK YOU CAN PUT MONEY
ON IT BEING A MAN.

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,200
I MAY NOT LIKE
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

336
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,800
ARE DOING TO THIS WORLD,
BUT CREATING

337
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,200
GIANT KILLER WAVES
IS NOT REALLY MY STYLE.

338
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
OK, FINE. WE JUST DID
A NIFTY LAUNDERING JOB

339
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,200
ON EVERYONE WHO WAS
IN THAT ROOM,

340
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,400
BUT YOU'RE STILL SAYING
IT WAS SOMEONE IN THERE.

341
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
MY MONEY'S
RIDING ON IT.

342
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,400
YOU GOTTA STOP
TALKING ABOUT MONEY,

343
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
OR I'M GONNA
THINK YOU'RE RICH.

344
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
ARE YOU?

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,800
HOW DO YOU PAY
YOUR BILLS, WAHL?

346
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I PLAY THE STOCK MARKET.

347
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,400
SO YOU'RE
INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY,

348
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
AND A MYSTERIOUS PERSON
IS CONTACTING YOU,

349
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,600
SENDING YOU CARTOONS.

350
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
WHY?

351
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,800
I DON'T KNOW.

352
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,200
LOOK, I CAN'T GET
INTO AQUATRONICS.

353
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I NEED YOU TO DO THAT.

354
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,800
DO WHAT?

355
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I WANT YOU TO RUN EVERYONE
WHO WAS IN THAT CONFERENCE

356
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
THROUGH THE LATEST
NAVY SECURITY PROFILES.

357
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
INCLUDING ME.

358
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,200
OH, I'D START WITH YOU.

359
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,000
WHAT, TOO STRONG?

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
JUST A BIT.

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
HAVE A LITTLE SUGAR.

362
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
NO.
NO?

363
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
HAVE YOU SEEN MY DOG?

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
CODY?

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
CODY!

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,400
CODY!

367
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
WAHL?

368
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
YEAH.

369
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
WHAT IS IT THAT
I'M LOOKING FOR?

370
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE--CODY!

371
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
YOU DON'T MAKE SENSE.

372
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,000
HEY, I'M AN OPEN BOOK.
SO WHO'S ALAN?

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,400
I'M A CLOSED BOOK.

374
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
MY EX-HUSBAND.

375
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

376
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
DO WHAT?

377
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
GET ME TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING

378
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
WHEN I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO.

379
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,000
RELAX. YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD ME ANYTHING.

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
YET.

381
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
CODY.

382
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
MORNIN'.

383
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,200
MORNIN'.

384
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
SO, DOC, MAN,
THESE TIDAL WAVES.

385
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
HOW BIG WE TALKIN'?

386
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
OH, 50 FEET HIGH.

387
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
60, MAYBE.

388
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
60?!

389
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,200
TELL ME YOU WOULDN'T LOVE TO
JUST SHRED ONE OF THEM, MAN.

390
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,000
HEY, WHAT'S UP WITH CODY?

391
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,600
I MEAN, HE ALWAYS WAITS
FOR YOU TO THROW THE STICK.

392
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, DOC?

393
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
TIDAL WAVE.

394
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
A TIDAL WAVE?

395
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
TIDAL WAVE!

396
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,600
TIDAL WAVE! WHOO!

397
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,800
CHICK, FORGET IT, MAN!
IT'LL KILL YOU!

398
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
CODY! CODY, COME HERE!

399
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
CODY!

400
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,800
CODY!
COME ON, CODY!

401
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
CODY!

402
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
CODY!

403
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
COME ON!

404
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
COME ON! HURRY!
HURRY UP! COME ON!

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
COME ON. GET IN THE BACK.
GET IN THE BACK.

406
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
OVER THERE!

407
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,600
HELP ME!
HELP ME!

408
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
THIS WOMAN
NEED HELP!

409
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,600
IT'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT! RELAX.

410
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,600
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

411
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
OK. GIVE ME YOUR ARM.
GIVE ME YOUR ARM.

412
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
HELP!

413
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
CODY?

414
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,200
CODY?

415
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,200
CODY...

416
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
WE'RE HERE!

417
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,800
COME ON. COME ON.
FORGET ABOUT IT. COME ON.

418
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,000
LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

419
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,200
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU GOT BANGED UP

420
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,600
QUITE A BIT THERE, SON,
WHEN THE WAVE HIT.

421
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,800
YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

422
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.

423
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,800
CHECK OUT MY BUDDY,
WOULD YOU?

424
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,400
RIGHT AWAY.
WE GOT A CRITICAL!

425
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,800
J.T., CHECK HIM OUT.

426
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,400
YOUR ARM NEEDS TO BE
TAKEN CARE OF, TOO.

427
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
I'M ALL RIGHT!

428
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,800
NO, NO, NO. YOU NEED
TO SIT DOWN, SIR,

429
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,800
AND HAVE SOMEONE
TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR ARM.

430
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
RIGHT THERE.
THERE YOU GO.

431
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
HOVERCRAFT STAFF,
REPORT IMMEDIATELY.

432
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,200
A SURGICAL STRIKE.

433
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
LOOK AT THAT.

434
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,200
LOOK AT THAT. THE WHOLE
COASTLINE'S WIPED OUT.

435
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
A BLOCK AWAY, PEOPLE
ARE TOSSING STEAKS

436
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
ON THE BARBECUE.

437
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,400
AND JUST BEFORE
IT HAPPENS,

438
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,000
JOHN WAHL
DROPS IN ON YOU.

439
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
NOW, THAT'S INTERESTING.

440
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,600
YOU THINK
HE DID THAT?

441
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
THAT'S HIS HOME.

442
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
MAYBE HE'S THINKING
OF MOVING.

443
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,200
I'M GOING DOWN THERE.

444
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,000
YOU DO THAT.

445
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
BUT BEFORE YOU GO,

446
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,000
LET ME TELL YOU A FEW THINGS
ABOUT YOUR NEW FRIEND.

447
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
IN '81, HE HEADED
HIGH WEAPONS TESTING

448
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,000
AT RAT ISLAND
FOR N-RAT.

449
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,600
IN '84, HE GOT
THE NOBEL PRIZE

450
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
FOR HIS RESEARCH

451
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
IN HYDROTHERMAL GUIDANCE
SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT.

452
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,000
I KNOW ALL THAT.

453
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
JUST LISTEN.

454
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,000
ONE YEAR LATER, HE BROKE
INTO A CONFIDENTIAL NETWORK,

455
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
FOUND OUT WE WERE
CONSIDERING USING

456
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,600
SOME OF THOSE WEAPONS
TO REARM IRAN,

457
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,000
LEAKED THE NEWS,
THEN MARCHED INTO THE OFFICE

458
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
OF THE UNDERSECRETARY
OF DEFENSE,

459
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,400
THE UNDERSECRETARY
OF DEFENSE,

460
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,600
TOSSED THE WASHINGTON POST
ON HIS DESK

461
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,000
SO HE'D BE THE FIRST TO SEE
WHAT WAHL HAD DONE.

462
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,400
THE SECRETARY CALLED HIM
A TRAITOR, WHICH HE WAS,

463
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,200
AND WAHL DECKED HIM.

464
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
THE UNDERSECRETARY
OF DEFENSE

465
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,200
WAS PLANNING
TO BREAK THE LAW.

466
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,600
ONLY PLANNING IT.

467
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,400
YOUR FRIEND DID.

468
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,000
THEN HE PULLED A HOUDINI
AND DISAPPEARED.

469
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,800
I THINK HE'S STILL
MAD AT THE SYSTEM.

470
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,200
I THINK HE DOESN'T CARE
IF PEOPLE DIE.

471
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,800
I THINK WE'RE
THROUGH HERE.

472
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
DON'T EXPECT TO FIND HIM.

473
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,000
SECURITY. SECURITY,
AREA 5, IMMEDIATELY.

474
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I KNOW HIM.

475
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,000
HE COULD DO THIS
WITH HIS EYES CLOSED.

476
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
DR. WAHL!

477
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
MY GOD! YOU WERE
HERE WHEN--

478
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
GO AWAY!

479
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,400
I SAW EDGAR.

480
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
WAHL, HE'S CONVINCED
IT'S YOU.

481
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
YOU GOT A BAD SENSE
OF TIMING, LADY.

482
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,400
YOU ARE JUST DARING HIM TO
POINT THE FINGER AT YOU. WHY?!

483
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
JUST GET AWAY FROM ME!

484
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
YOU'VE GOT THE KNOW-HOW
TO MAKE THESE WAVES HAPPEN.

485
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,000
DO YOU THINK I WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

486
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
TO ANYONE?

487
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
MY DOG IS DEAD!

488
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,800
MY HOUSE IS--

489
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
I DON'T KNOW.
PICK IT OUT!

490
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,800
IS IT THERE?!
IS IT THERE?!

491
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,400
I'M LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

492
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
YOU CAN DROP THAT IDEA

493
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
OF SOMEBODY USING ANY KIND
OF BOMB TO DO THIS.

494
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,400
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

495
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,600
WAHL! I'M STUMBLING
AROUND IN THE DARK HERE,

496
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
AND YOU ACT LIKE
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

497
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,000
I DON'T KNOW DIDDLY,

498
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
BUT I WAS INVOLVED
IN OFFSHORE NUCLEAR TESTING.

499
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,600
YEAH, WE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE A TIDAL WAVE.

500
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS.

501
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
AN EXPLOSION,
ESPECIALLY A NUCLEAR ONE,

502
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,600
IS A BAD WAY TO DO IT.
IT'S ALL HEAT.

503
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
THE DISPERSED WATER
EVAPORATES.

504
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,800
THERE'S GONNA BE A WAVE,

505
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
BUT BY THE TIME
IT HITS THE SHORE,

506
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,200
IT'S GONNA BE
DOWN TO NOTHING.

507
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,800
IF IT CAN'T BE DONE,

508
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
WHY DO THEY THINK
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE?

509
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,600
'CAUSE I WAS GETTIN' CLOSE
TO THE WAY IT COULD BE DONE.

510
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,000
COULD BE DONE,
DR. WEAVER.

511
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,200
NOBODY KNEW
HOW CLOSE I WAS.

512
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,800
I DIDN'T DO IT, WEAVER!
I GOT OUT!

513
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,200
I BUILT MYSELF
A NICE LITTLE SCENARIO.

514
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,400
I SLUGGED A GUY
AT DEFENSE,

515
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,200
I DUG MYSELF A HOLE,
AND I JUST DROPPED THROUGH.

516
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,800
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYTHING ANYMORE!

517
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,600
THEY CAN ALL BLOW
THEMSELVES UP FOR ALL I CARE.

518
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,200
I GOT OUT...
AND I WANT TO STAY OUT.

519
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,600
HE WANTS ME
TO TRY AND FIND HIM.

520
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,200
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

521
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,000
WHOEVER THE HELL
IS DOING THIS.

522
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
THE PHONE CALL,
THE LETTER.

523
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,200
IT'S AN INVITATION.

524
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,600
"FIND ME."

525
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
THEN DO IT.

526
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
GIVE ME SOME TIME.

527
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,200
I WILL.

528
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
MAYBE I CAN
BUY YOU SOME.

529
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,800
COME ON.

530
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,800
AQUATRONICS.

531
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,400
IT'S JESSICA WEAVER.

532
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,600
LET ME SPEAK
WITH DR. PURCELL.

533
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,200
PURCELL.

534
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,400
EDGAR?

535
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
I JUST CAME FROM THE BEACH.

536
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
JOHN WAHL'S MISSING.

537
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,200
HE WAS THERE, BUT, UH,
NOT ANYMORE.

538
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,000
WHO, EXACTLY,
SAID HE WAS--

539
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
LET ME SUGGEST YOU PUT
SOME OF THE OTHERS

540
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,800
UNDER THE SAME MICROSCOPE
YOU'VE GOT LOCKED ON WAHL.

541
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
WE ALREADY ARE,
DR. WEAVER.

542
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,600
THANK YOU FOR SHARING
YOUR THOUGHTS.

543
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,200
EDGAR, I HOPE YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR MORE THAN

544
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,600
HOW HE'S DOING IT.

545
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,400
GO HOME, DR. WEAVER.

546
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,400
THE BASTARD.

547
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,000
YEAH. WELL,

548
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT
HE'S THE TOP BASTARD.

549
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,800
OH, JEEZ.

550
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
YOU'VE GOT TO LET ME
LOOK AT THAT ARM.

551
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
HEY, HEY...

552
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
JUST DRIVE.

553
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,600
EARLIER TODAY,

554
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,000
THE PRESIDENT FLEW OVER
THE DISASTER AREA

555
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,600
AND LATER MET
WITH SURVIVORS

556
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
TO PERSONALLY EXPRESS
HIS SYMPATHY.

557
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,800
IN A SEPARATE STATEMENT,

558
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,000
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ASKED
ALL AMERICANS TO REMAIN CALM.

559
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,600
THIS SO-CALLED
CONFERENCE, MR. CLARK,

560
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
WHY, EXACTLY,
DID THEY CALL IT?

561
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
MR. PURCELL
HAS ALREADY DECIDED

562
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,600
THAT JOHN WAHL
IS RESPONSIBLE

563
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,400
FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING.

564
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,800
I DON'T THINK HE HAS.

565
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,600
AH. SO IT'S NOT
JOHN WAHL.

566
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,400
IT'S ONE OF US.

567
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,800
YOU THINK
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

568
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
ON THE CONTRARY,

569
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,800
EVERY ONE OF US HAS
CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY

570
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,400
OF CONTROLLING
SUCH A NATURAL POWER.

571
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
THIS PLACE, THIS AQUATRONICS,

572
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,200
RECEIVES SO MUCH MONEY
FROM THE GOVERNMENT

573
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,800
BECAUSE TO HARNESS THE OCEANS

574
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,000
WOULD MAKE EVERYONE
PAY ATTENTION.

575
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,800
SO IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE
THAT ONE OF US IS DOING IT.

576
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,400
NOT I, OF COURSE.

577
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
WOULD YOU RELAX, WAHL?

578
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,600
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

579
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
I HAD
2 YEARS OF PREMED.

580
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
THEN WHAT?
TALK TO ME, COMMANDER.

581
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
ABOUT WHAT?

582
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
YOU ARE SUCH A SISSY.
YOU'RE AFRAID TO WATCH.

583
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
YEAH, WHEN IT COMES
TO ME, YES, I AM.

584
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,200
ALL RIGHT, YOU DID
A COUPLE OF YEARS PREMED,

585
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
THEN WHAT?

586
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
DON'T GIVE ME ONE
OF THOSE PRINTOUT RESUMES.

587
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
YOU KNOW,

588
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
"I WENT TO AFGHANISTAN
UNDER COVER OF BLAH BLAH."

589
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,600
OK, OK, I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

590
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
WELL, MY FATHER
WAS NAVY...

591
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
KOREA?

592
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
MM-HMM.

593
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
I WAS BORN

594
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,600
AFTER HE CAME BACK
AND RETIRED.

595
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
HE WAS A LOT OLDER
THAN MOM.

596
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I GREW UP
LOVING THE WATER.

597
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
OW!

598
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
OK. OK,
I'M FINISHED.

599
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
WHAT DID YOU--

600
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,200
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JEEZ.

601
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,600
WELL, YOU WANT TO
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?

602
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

603
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
IT'S NICE STITCHING.

604
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,600
THANKS.

605
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
YOU DO GOOD WORK.

606
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,600
WELL, WE BETTER GET
YOU SOME CLOTHES.

607
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,600
OHH...

608
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,000
THEY'RE ALAN'S.

609
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,000
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO GET RID OF THEM,

610
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,600
BUT AREN'T YOU GLAD
I DIDN'T?

611
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
THRILLED.

612
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
IT'S A LITTLE...
SNUG FOR YOU?

613
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
HE ACTUALLY WORE
THIS STUFF?

614
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
LOOK, I THINK I'M
JUST GOING TO

615
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,600
WASH MY OWN CLOTHES.
YOU DO HAVE

616
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
A WASHING MACHINE
AROUND HERE, WEAVER?

617
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,000
YES, I DO,

618
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,600
AND THE NAME
IS JESSIE.

619
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,800
STILL GOT YOUR HUSBAND'S
CLOTHES, HUH?

620
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,400
I FIND THAT KIND OF
INTERESTING.

621
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,800
NO, IT'S NOT.
THEY'RE JUST CLOTHES.

622
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
NO.

623
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400
THEY'RE
ALAN'S CLOTHES.

624
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
GUESS YOU STILL GOT

625
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,800
SOMETHING THERE
FOR HIM, HUH?

626
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,200
THERE IS NOTHING THERE.

627
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
YOU KNOW, EITHER WAY,

628
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,800
IT'S REALLY NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

629
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,200
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'M SORRY.

630
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
IT'S OK.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

631
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
FORGET IT.
I'M SORRY.

632
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
I'LL SEE YOU
LATER.

633
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

634
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
AQUATRONICS,
REMEMBER?

635
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
AND DON'T USE
THE PHONES.

636
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,200
YOU THINK
THEY'D BUG YOU?

637
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
I KNOW THEY WOULD.

638
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,200
TRY NOT TO BURN DOWN
THE HOUSE

639
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
WHILE I'M GONE, WAHL.

640
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,800
IT'S JOHN.

641
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
JOHN.

642
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
JOHN WAHL AND
JESSICA WEAVER.

643
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,200
HEY!

644
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
WE HAVE
THE SAME INITIALS.

645
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
CLEVER.

646
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
YOUNG JOHN WAHL
WAS BRILLIANT.

647
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
UNPREDICTABLE.

648
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,200
IDEALISTIC.

649
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,800
JUST YOUR
REGULAR SCIENTIST.

650
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,200
I WAS THERE
WHEN HE, UH...

651
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,400
WHEN THAT INCIDENT WITH
THE UNDERSECRETARY HAPPENED.

652
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST A FEELING I HAD.

653
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,200
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

654
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,800
I HAD THE SAME FEELING
AGAIN THE OTHER DAY

655
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,800
WHEN I SAW HIM.

656
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,600
WHAT FEELING WAS THIS,
DR. SCHIFF?

657
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
THE REASON WE THOUGHT
HE TOOK OFF AND QUIT.

658
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,200
NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS IT.

659
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,000
I THINK IT WAS
SOMETHING ELSE.

660
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,400
I THINK...

661
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,200
I THINK IT WAS
SOMETHING HE FOUND.

662
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,000
SOMETHING HE WANTED
TO KEEP TO HIMSELF.

663
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,800
TO HIMSELF...

664
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,400
OR FOR HIMSELF?

665
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,600
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH
THAT SUGGESTION, MR. CLARK.

666
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,800
I CAN'T EVEN GET CLOSE
TO THEIR FILES.

667
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,000
WAHL?

668
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,600
RIGHT HERE.
AAH! GOD...

669
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,000
SORRY. I'M SORRY.

670
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,600
ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING IS
ALL CLEAR OUT BACK, I THINK.

671
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,000
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

672
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,400
ZIP. I THOUGHT I
COULD PATCH THROUGH

673
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,000
TO THE AQUATRONICS
MAINFRAME,

674
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
BUT
IT'S BLOCKING ME.

675
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,800
LET ME TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.

676
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,800
I COULDN'T GET
TO THEIR FILES

677
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,600
BECAUSE THEY WERE
RIGHT THERE ALL DAY.

678
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
EDGAR WALKING AROUND

679
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
LOOKING
OVER MY SHOULDER.

680
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,200
AGAMO WAS USING THE
MAINFRAME COMPUTER.

681
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,800
THE MINUTE
HE FINISHED,

682
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,000
BERNARD NETWORKED IT

683
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
OVER TO THE WAVE ROOM
TO USE IT.

684
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK AT THIS.

685
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,800
THE SURF
FROM THE OTHER DAY.

686
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,000
HOW'D YOU MAKE
THAT HAPPEN?

687
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
THE WEATHER SERVICE
HAS EVERY WEATHER PATTERN

688
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,200
TRANSLATED INTO
NUMBERED COORDINATES.

689
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
ADD AN ALGORITHM...

690
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
MM-HMM.

691
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,000
YOU GET IT IN PICTURES.

692
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,800
LOOK.

693
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,000
THIS MORNING'S WAVE.

694
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,200
SOMEWHERE...

695
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,000
THERE HAS TO BE
A GROUND ZERO.

696
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,200
I KNOW.

697
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,800
WELL, LET'S FIND IT.

698
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,600
NO. I MEAN,

699
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,200
THIS IS WHAT BERNARD
WAS WORKING ON.

700
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
HE HAD IT UP ON THE
WAVE ROOM MONITORS.

701
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
TODAY?

702
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,600
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

703
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
BERNARD WAS LOOKING
THROUGH THIS?

704
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,200
HE STILL IS.
HE STAYED BEHIND

705
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,400
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
HE WAS ON TO SOMETHING.

706
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,400
MAY I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

707
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,600
IF YOU'RE CREATING WAVES,

708
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
AND YOU WANT TO KEEP
ANYBODY FROM FINDING OUT

709
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
WHERE THEY ORIGINATED,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

710
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
FIND THE ONE COMPUTER
THAT WOULD SHOW YOU HOW.

711
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,200
BERNARD?

712
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

713
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,800
IT MAKES SENSE.

714
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
WHEN WE WERE WORKING
ON WAVES,

715
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
WE WERE WORKING FROM
MATHEMATICAL MODELS

716
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,400
THAT HE CREATED.

717
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
YEAH, BUT...

718
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
HE'S NICE.

719
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,800
YOU SAID SO
YOURSELF.

720
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,800
YEAH, HE'S ONE OF
THE REAL DARLINGS

721
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
OF THE THEORETICAL
SCIENCES, JUST LIKE ME.

722
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,800
BUT YOU STILL
SUSPECT ME...

723
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,400
DON'T YOU?

724
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
WELL, HE MUST BE GONE.

725
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,600
DO YOU SMELL SOMETHING?

726
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,800
LET ME TURN THE LIGHT ON.

727
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
SOMETHING'S BURNING.

728
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,000
WHAT...

729
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,200
WE'VE GOT TO CALL
THE POLICE.

730
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
WAIT. WE WILL.

731
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,800
FIRST, LET'S SEE
WHAT HE WAS WORKING ON.

732
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
LISBON.

733
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,400
JOHN, LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE.

734
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
GIVE ME
A FEW MORE SECONDS.

735
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,000
THE COMPUTER ROOM!

736
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,400
SEND SOME BACKUP!

737
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
HEY!

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
MAN, I GOT TO
GET AHOLD OF CHICK.

739
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,400
I GOT TO FIND OUT
HOW HE'S DOING.

740
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,800
THIS IS GETTING
VERY PERSONAL.

741
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
WHOEVER'S DOING THIS
DOESN'T JUST WANT ME BLAMED.

742
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
ONCE HE GETS ME,
HE WANTS ME DEAD.

743
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
FOR NOW, HE NEEDS ME
TO KEEP THE OTHERS BUSY

744
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WHILE HE GETS READY.

745
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
READY FOR WHAT?

746
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
LISBON.

747
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,800
THAT'S WHAT
BERNARD WAS TRACKING.

748
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,000
1755, A TIDAL WAVE
HIT PORTUGAL,

749
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,400
KILLED 60,000 PEOPLE.

750
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
FOR A SECOND, I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT BERNARD

751
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,800
WAS PLANNING TO MAKE
HAPPEN AGAIN.

752
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,400
LOOK, I GOT TO GET
SOMEPLACE,

753
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
I GOT TO
GET BACK ONLINE,

754
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
I GOT TO START CHECKING
SOME THINGS OUT.

755
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,200
WE CAN'T GO
BACK TO MY PLACE.

756
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,400
THEY'RE
ALREADY CONVINCED

757
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,600
THAT YOU'RE MAKING
THE TIDAL WAVES,

758
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
AND NOW THEY'RE
GOING TO THINK

759
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,800
WE KILLED BERNARD.

760
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,400
HOW'D I GET
INTO THIS?

761
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,600
LIKE PURCELL SAID...

762
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
MY CHARM.

763
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
THANK YOU.

764
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,400
I'M ALMOST FINISHED.

765
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

766
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
AHH...

767
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
WELL,
THE PRESIDENT SAYS

768
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
THE GOVERNMENT IS
IN TOTAL CONTROL.

769
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
HMM. REALLY?

770
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,400
YEAH. AND THERE'S
THIS SURVIVALIST

771
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
WHO'S GOING TO BUY
HIMSELF A MOUNTAIN TOP

772
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,400
AND BUILD
HIMSELF AN ARK.

773
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,000
OH. I'M SERIOUS.

774
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,000
AAH.

775
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,000
I GOT THIS PAIN
THAT GOES STRAIGHT FROM

776
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
THE BACK OF MY NECK
RIGHT TO MY HEAD--

777
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
YOU NEED TO TAKE
A SHOWER.

778
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,000
OH. YOU TRYING TO
TELL ME SOMETHING?

779
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
AS HOT AS YOU CAN
STAND IT,

780
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
THEN CALL ME
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

781
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
AYE, AYE, SIR.

782
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
OH.

783
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,400
SHH...

784
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
MMM.
THAT'S BETTER STILL.

785
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,000
SALT WATER IS VERY BAD
FOR YOUR HAIR, YOU KNOW?

786
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,400
YEAH, WELL, IT'S
A LITTLE LATE FOR ME.

787
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,000
I READ ALL ABOUT YOU
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.

788
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
YEAH?

789
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
YOU WERE
SOMETHING ELSE.

790
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
YEAH?
I'M NOT THAT OLD.

791
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,400
WAHL?

792
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
HMM?

793
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
I'M JEALOUS.

794
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,000
OF WHAT?

795
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
OF YOU.

796
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
YOU DO EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

797
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
AH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

798
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
NOT YOUR USUAL
"WANTED" POSTER, ARE WE?

799
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
ARE WE GOING TO JUST
KEEP ON RUNNING?

800
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
WE HAVE TO.

801
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
THEY CAUGHT UP
WITH YOU LAST TIME.

802
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,400
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU RUB
THIS SIDE RIGHT THERE.

803
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
WORK YOUR HAND UP
OVER THIS WAY HERE.

804
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,000
OH, I'LL WORK
MY HAND UP.

805
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,800
YES, MR. PURCELL.
THAT'S THEM.

806
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,600
THANK YOU.

807
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
I KNEW IT.

808
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,200
I KNEW IT WAS HIM.

809
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,600
RIGHT FROM THE START.
I FELT IT.

810
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,200
WE JUST FOUND
WEAVER'S CAR

811
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,000
SITTING AT THE CURB
AT BURBANK AIRPORT.

812
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,400
WE FOUND THIS UNDER
THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

813
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,400
IT'S A MINIATURE
MICROPHONE.

814
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
WHAT ARE THEY
PLAYING AT?

815
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
SIR? YOU BETTER
TAKE A LOOK.

816
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,800
ATTENTION.
INTRUSION, AREA 2.

817
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,600
ATTENTION.
INTRUSION, AREA 2.

818
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
A BILLION DOLLARS?

819
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,200
"IF YOU WANT TO THINK
I AM KIDDING, BE MY GUEST,

820
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,400
"BUT SOON IT WILL SOUND
LIKE A BARGAIN.

821
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,600
I'LL BE IN TOUCH."

822
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
YOU ALL RIGHT?

823
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
OH, YEAH.

824
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
ALL RIGHT.

825
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR?

826
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,200
NOT "WHAT." "WHO."

827
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
I ALREADY TRIED GETTING

828
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,200
EVERYBODY'S
NAVY SECURITY PROFILE.

829
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,600
NO, NO, FORGET THAT.

830
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,000
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY
UNUSUAL TIDAL WAVE LINKS

831
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,400
TO ANYBODY WHO WAS
AT THE CONFERENCE.

832
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
THERE'S NO REASON
STUFF LIKE THAT

833
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,000
SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED.

834
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
ALL RIGHT,

835
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,000
I'M IN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE
OF SCIENCE CENTRAL FILE.

836
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,400
NOW THEN...

837
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,400
REST IN PEACE, JULES.

838
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,600
WE KNOW IT'S NOT YOU.

839
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,000
YOU NEED A KEYCODE.

840
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,600
UM...TRY "TIDAL WAVES."

841
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,400
NO. NO, NO,
IT'S TOO GENERAL.

842
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,800
OK. UM...

843
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
"TSUNAMIS."

844
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
HELLO, DR. AGAMO.

845
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,400
AGAMO...

846
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,400
LET'S ADD
ANOTHER KEYWORD...

847
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
"SEISMIC WEAPONS."

848
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
"THERMONUCLEAR..."

849
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
YOU SAID
IT WASN'T A BOMB.

850
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
A TSUNAMI HAPPENS WHEN
THE SEA FLOOR IS ALTERED

851
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
EITHER BY AN EARTHQUAKE,
A VOLCANIC ERUPTION...

852
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,400
BUT WE CAN'T MAKE
THOSE HAPPEN.

853
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
AGAMO CONFIRMED THAT
HIMSELF.

854
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,800
BUT A TSUNAMI ALSO HAPPENS

855
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
WHEN THERE'S
AN UNDERWATER LANDSLIDE.

856
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,800
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

857
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,600
WHAT IF
HE'S BLOWING UP MOUNTAINS?

858
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
LOOK.

859
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
3 LINKED REFERENCES
TO "TSUNAMI"

860
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,000
AND THE WORD
"THERMONUCLEAR."

861
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,400
"CRASHER." WHAT'S THAT?

862
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,200
IT'S A THESIS PAPER
FROM 1959.

863
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,600
"GENERAL DOOLITTLE'S
FUJI PLAN WAS SOUND

864
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
"AND WOULD HAVE ENDED
THE WAR AND SPARED LIVES.

865
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,600
"IMAGINE HOW MANY LIVES
WOULD'VE BEEN SPARED

866
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
"HAD A LARGE TIDAL WAVE
BEEN CREATED

867
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,800
AND CLEARED THE BEACHES
OF NORMANDY."

868
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,400
YOU SAID THIS
IN THE CONFERENCE.

869
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
NO. NO.

870
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
STANLEY SCHIFF

871
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
TALKED ABOUT DOOLITTLE'S
IDEA, REMEMBER?

872
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I TOLD YOU THIS.

873
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
SOMEBODY CALLED ME
AT MY HOUSE

874
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
RIGHT AFTER
THE CONFERENCE.

875
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,200
THAT PERSON ALSO TALKED
ABOUT NORMANDY.

876
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,800
DR. SCHIFF...

877
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,400
"IS IT POSSIBLE
TO CREATE A TSUNAMI?

878
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,800
"IN THEORY,
ABSOLUTELY.

00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,200

882
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,400
OH...WHAT THE HELL
IS IT DOING?

883
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,600
WHAT?

884
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

885
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,400
WE'VE BEEN AMBUSHED.

886
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,400
HE MUST HAVE
A PROGRAM IN HERE

887
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,000
THAT SCANS EVERYTHING
USING HIS NAME

888
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,000
AND LETS HIM KNOW WHEN
SOMEONE COMES KNOCKING.

889
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
HELLO, STANLEY.

890
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,400
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST
ERASE THE ARTICLE?

891
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
STANLEY SCHIFF ERASE?

892
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
NO.

893
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,400
"WE HAVE TO TALK.

894
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,600
"MEET ME

WE TAKE OUT JOHN WAHL.

905

HE SAID
IF WE TRY ANYTHING,

906

VERY SUSTAINABLE LOSSES

I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'VE
GOT 2 OR 3 PEOPLE.

911
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,200
WE HAVE THE SUSPECT.

912
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,400
YOU COCKY
LITTLE FREAK.

913
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,400
EVERYTHING
I TAUGHT YOU.

914
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,000
YOU THOUGHT
YOU CAN DO IT

915
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
WITH ONE HAND TIED
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

916
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
SURE, GUYS. PUSHING
THE BUTTON'S EASY,

917
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,800
BUT WHAT ABOUT
PULLING THE TRIGGER?

918
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,000
WELL, WATCH ME,
SONNY BOY.

919
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,600
HI! WE'RE OVER HERE!

920
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,800
WHERE'S RAY?

921
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
OH, I'M NOT SURE.

922
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
THIS WAY.

923
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,200
WHOA. WHOA.

924
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,400
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

925
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,200
MEETING YOU.

926
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,200
LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.

927
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,800
NO BILLION DOLLARS,
THOUGH.

928
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,200
TOUGH BREAK.

929
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,000
WHAT
BILLION DOLLARS?

930
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,400
OH, MAN, I SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

931
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,000
CLARK, YOU GOT TO--
TO LISTEN TO ME.

932
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,200
I KNOW WHO IT IS.

933
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,000
YEAH? SO DO I.

934
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,200
YOU!
NO! NO!

935
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,800
LOOK, I GOT
THE SAME MESSAGE.

936
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,400
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS.

937
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,400
LOOK, YOU GO--

938
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,400
MAN DOWN!

939
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
COME ON!
CLARK'S BEEN HIT.

940
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
HOLD ON, BUDDY,
HOLD ON!

941
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,400
COME ON! COME ON!
COME ON!

942
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,600
LOOK OUT!

943
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,600
GO! GO!

944
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
DOWN THERE!
I GOT THEM!

945
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,800
COME ON.
LET'S GO!

946
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,000
GET A BEAD
ON 'EM.

947
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,800
HOLD ON.

948
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
IN THE BOAT!

949
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
JESSIE, GET DOWN!

950
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,600
TSUNAMI ALERT.
YOU COPY?

951
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,400
COPY THAT.

952
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,400
THERE'S A TIDAL WAVE
COMING.

953
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,800
WE GOT ONE MINUTE.

954
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,800
GET EVERYONE
OFF THE SHIP!

955
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,800
MAYDAY!
MAYDAY! MAYDAY!

956
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,400
GO! GO! GO!

957
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
JOHN.
HOLD ON.

958
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,200
NO! LISTEN!

959
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,600
HE'S DOING IT AGAIN.

960
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,800
HANG ON!

961
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
ARE YOU CRAZY?

962
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,400
IT'S COMING AT US!

963
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,000
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE.

964
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,800
OH, NO...

965
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,000
COME ON!

966
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,200
COME ON...COME ON...

967
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,200
WE'RE GOING
THROUGH IT! HOLD ON!

968
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,600
HOLD ON!
COME HERE!

969
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,000
OH, MY GOD.

970
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
HE LOVES
WHAT HE'S DOING.

971
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
HEY. HEY.

972
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,600
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S SAFE IN HERE?

973
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,400
FOR NOW.

974
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,400
WELL,

975
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,000
I'LL MAKE A FIRE.

976
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
NO.

977
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
NO, WE DON'T KNOW
WHO'S AROUND HERE.

978
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
WELL...

979
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,800
YOU MEAN,
LOOKING FOR US?

980
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,800
JUST, UH...

981
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,400
DON'T START A FIRE.

982
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,800
I'M GOING TO GO
DOWNSTAIRS

983
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,400
AND GET US SOME FOOD.

984
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,400
SO HOW DOES THIS PLACE

985
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,000
FIT INTO THE JOHN WAHL
SCHEME OF THINGS?

986
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,800
MY EX-WIFE LIVED HERE
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

987
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
EX-WIFE?

988
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,800
SHE USED TO LIVE HERE.

989
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,200
ALONE?

990
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,200
NO.

991
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
WITH THE GUY

992
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,200
I FOUND HER
IN BED WITH.

993
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,200
WHO'S THE GUY?

994
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,800
JUST...

995
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,200
SOMEONE.

996
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,200
YOU DIDN'T DROP OUT

997
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,800
BECAUSE OF SOME PERSONAL
ETHICAL CONFLICT.

998
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,000
IT WAS BECAUSE
OF HER, WASN'T IT?

999
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,600
WRONG.

1000
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,200
THEY GOT ME STRAIGHT
OUT OF GRAD SCHOOL.

1001
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,600
I LOVED IT.

1002
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,800
FROM DAY ONE,

1003
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,600
STANLEY HAD ME WORKING
ON HIGH-ENERGY SYSTEMS,

1004
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
THINGS, BIG, IMPORTANT THINGS

1005
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,600
THAT WERE GOING TO...
HELP THE WORLD.

1006
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,200
NEXT THING I KNOW,

1007
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,600
I'M DEVELOPING
LASER-GUIDED WARHEADS.

1008
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
I KEPT THINKING,
IT'S STILL THEORETICAL,

1009
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,600
IT'S EXPERIMENTAL...

1010
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,200
BOY, WAS I WRONG.

1011
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,200
ONE FINE DAY,

1012
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,200
IN A SINGLE FLASH
OF LIGHT,

1013
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,600
SOMETHING I DEVELOPED
KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE.

1014
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,800
I WAS FINISHING UP
MY STINT

1015
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,200
WITH THE JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF,

1016
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,800
AND EDGAR WAS
TRYING TO CONVINCE ME

1017
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,200
TO RUN AN OPERATION...

1018
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,800
HE CALLED TACTICAL EXERCISE.

1019
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,000
HE GOT HIS WAY...

1020
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,600
USING MY WARHEADS.

1021
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
HE WAS IN CONTROL.

1022
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
HE KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

1023
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,800
EVEN BEFORE HE DID IT.

1024
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,400
HE ALSO KNEW HOW
TO IMPRESS THE BRASS...

1025
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,400
WITH A REAL BODY COUNT.

1026
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,200
JOHN, YOU DIDN'T
KILL ANYBODY.

1027
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,200
EDGAR DID.

1028
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
THAT'S FUNNY.

1029
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,600
I KEEP THINKING
IT WAS ME.

1030
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO THINK.

1031
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

1032
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,400
THANKS FOR
THE INSIGHT, DOCTOR.

1033
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,800
YOU'RE NOT
THAT COMPLICATED.

1034
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,400
YOU KNOW
WHAT I LEARNED?

1035
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,400
DO YOU KNOW WHAT...

1036
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,800
REALLY SCARES ME?

1037
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,400
NO. TELL ME.

1038
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,800
ANYTHING
CAN BE JUSTIFIED.

1039
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,800
SOME THINGS

1040
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,400
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO JUSTIFY.

1041
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,400
WHAT?

1042
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,800
I WANT TO
BE IN CONTROL.

1043
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,800
OH. SO DO I.

1044
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,400
YEAH,
BUT SOMETIMES

1045
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,400
YOU'VE GOT
TO LET GO.

1046
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
WHAT IF I DON'T
WANT TO LET GO?

1047
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,800
THEN I CAN ORDER
YOU TO.

1048
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,400
I'M A LIEUTENANT
COMMANDER.

1049
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,400
YEAH, BUT WHAT
IF I DON'T KNOW

1050
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,800
HOW TO LET GO?

1051
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
LET ME SHOW YOU.

1052
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,200
MMM...

1053
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,200
HEY.

1054
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,600
YOU ALL RIGHT?

1055
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,600
I HAD A DREAM.

1056
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,200
ABOUT WHAT?

1057
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,600
STANLEY SCHIFF.

1058
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,200
HE WAS WORKING
ON A WEAPON.

1059
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,600
I--I THINK I KNOW

1060
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,200
WHAT HE'S GOING
TO DO NEXT.

1061
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,200
JOHN, IT WAS
JUST A DREAM.

1062
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,600
NO, IT--IT
WAS WHAT BERNARD

1063
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,200
WAS WORKING ON.
THE LISBON WAVE.

1064
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,000
WHO AM I
GOING TO TELL?

1065
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,400
WHO'S GOING
TO BELIEVE ME?

1066
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,600
WELL, WE'LL HAVE
TO STOP HIM.

1067
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,000
WE CAN'T STOP HIM.

1068
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,800
WELL, WE CAN
SLOW HIM DOWN.

1069
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,600
OR WE CAN THROW HIM OFF.

1070
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,200
UNBELIEVABLE.

1071
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,200
THE WHOLE WORLD WAS
BEING HELD HOSTAGE.

1072
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,200
I THINK IT STILL IS.

1073
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,200
YOU THINK HE
SURVIVED THE WAVE?

1074
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,000
I HOPE SO.

1075
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
UNTIL I SEE HIS BODY...

1076
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,200
I HAVE TO ASSUME
HE'S STILL OUT THERE.

1077
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,800
DR. SCHIFF,

1078
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,800
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT HE'S DOING THIS.

1079
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,800
JUST THINK OF THOSE
2 UNDERWATER WARHEADS

1080
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,800
HE DEVELOPED.

1081
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,000
I KNOW PERSONALLY
WHAT THEY CAN DO.

1082
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,400
SO DO I.

1083
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,400
BUT WH-WHAT
DOES HE WANT?

1084
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,600
A BILLION DOLLARS.

1085
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,600
HA HA HA!

1086
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,000
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

1087
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,600
ALL RIGHT, WHERE'S
HE GOING TO SPEND IT?

1088
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,400
HE'S A MURDERER
ON THE RUN.

1089
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,600
POWER, DR. SCHIFF.

1090
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,200
TO DO WHAT?

1091
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,800
USE IT.

1092
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,200
PLAY WITH IT.

1093
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,200
MANKIND RUNNING
AROUND PANICKED,

1094
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
WONDERING WHERE

1095
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
THE NEXT MONSTER'S
GOING TO HIT...

1096
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,400
YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO LET

1097
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,200
THAT HAPPEN TO ME,
TO MY COUNTRY?

1098
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,200
NEGATIVE!

1099
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,200
YOU GUYS EAT, SLEEP,
AND DREAM SCIENCE.

1100
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,000
I RESPECT THAT,

1101
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
BUT THIS IS NOT
ABOUT SCIENCE.

1102
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,600
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT POLITICS.

1103
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,200
THIS IS NOT EVEN
ABOUT BUSINESS.

1104
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,000
THIS IS ABOUT WHO
PULLS THE STRINGS.

1105
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,200
IT'S ABOUT
CONTROLLING THE WORLD.

1106
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,800
POWER.

1107
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,600
OH, GOD.

1108
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,000
IT IS YOUNG JOHN
AS GOD. I'M...

1109
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
OH, I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK SO.

1110
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,800
NO WAY.

1111
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,400
SCHIFF HERE.

1112
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,400
JOHN! HEY,

1113
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,200
WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?

1114
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO, BUT--

1115
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,600
KEEP HIM TALKING.

1116
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,600
HE'S ON NOW.

1117
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,800
GET SCHIFF'S NUMBER
AND TRACE IT.

1118
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,000
DO IT NOW.

1119
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
LISBON? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1120
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,400
BERNARD FIGURED IT OUT,
DIDN'T HE?

1121
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,000
SO YOU KILLED HIM.
AND THEN CLARK.

1122
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,400
HOW MANY MORE,
STANLEY?

1123
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,200
YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY.

1124
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,200
M-ME?

1125
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,800
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

1126
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,800
MARLAN CLARK IS ALIVE.

1127
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,600
CLARK IS ALIVE?

1128
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,600
WHAT?

1129
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,600
I KNOW YOU DON'T TRUST
THESE SPOOKS.

1130
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,400
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE YOURSELF UP TO ME?

1131
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,200
TO YOU?

1132
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,000
STANLEY, WHAT--

1133
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,400
HE HUNG UP.

1134
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,200
GOD, I WAS WRONG.

1135
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,600
ABOUT WHAT?

1136
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,400
OH, HE FIGURED OUT A WAY

1137
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,400
TO MAKE ONE OF
HIS WARHEADS DO IT.

1138
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
IT'S MY FAULT.

1139
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,600
I FORGOT.

1140
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,400
FORGOT WHAT?

1141
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,200
HOW WELL I TAUGHT HIM.

1142
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,000
WHAT WAS ALL THAT
ABOUT LISBON?

1143
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,200
HUH?

1144
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,800
OH.

1145
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,600
IN 1755, A WAVE
HIT PORTUGAL.

1146
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,000
60,000 PEOPLE
WERE KILLED.

1147
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

1148
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,200
OH...

1149
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,600
OH...

1150
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,200
"GIVE YOURSELF UP
TO ME."

1151
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
THAT WASN'T
FOR MY BENEFIT.

1152
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,200
SOMEBODY ELSE
WAS WITH HIM?

1153
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,200
EDGAR?

1154
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,200
PROBABLY.

1155
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,800
HE REALLY NEEDS
TO BELIEVE IT'S ME.

1156
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,000
SCHIFF CAN SMELL THAT.

1157
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,000
HE CAN FEED HIM WHATEVER
HE NEEDS TO HELP NAIL ME.

1158
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,400
WHAT IS IT BETWEEN
YOU AND EDGAR?

1159
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,200
HE'S THE ONE I FOUND
IN BED WITH MY WIFE.

1160
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,800
HE BROKE UP
YOUR MARRIAGE?

1161
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,800
WAS THAT
HIS HOUSE WE W--

1162
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
BOY, YOU GOT
A LOT OF GUTS.

1163
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
HE SOLD IT RIGHT AFTER
MY WIFE LEFT HIM.

1164
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,600
YOU NEVER SAY HER NAME.

1165
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,800
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1166
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,400
WELL, I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
IT IS IN CASE I MEET HER.

1167
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,600
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
SHE'S DEAD.

1168
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,400
SHE DROVE OVER
A CLIFF IN BIG SUR.

1169
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,600
EDGAR SAID
HE'D GONE TO SEE HER

1170
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,000
TO TRY TO GET BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN.

1171
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,400
HE SAID THAT SHE
HAD BEEN DRINKING.

1172
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,200
THEY GOT INTO SOME SORT
OF ARGUMENT,

1173
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,200
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE'S OFF IN HIS CAR.

1174
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,200
CORONER CONFIRMED
THAT SHE WAS DRUNK.

1175
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,800
HE COULD'VE GRABBED THE KEYS,
HE COULD'VE GONE WITH HER,

1176
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,000
HE COULD'VE DONE ANYTHING,
BUT HE DIDN'T.

1177
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,200
YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T CARE.

1178
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
HE DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT HER.

1179
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,200
HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING

1180
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,400
OR ANYONE BUT HIMSELF.

1181
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,800
HER NAME WAS KATHRYN.

1182
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,600
I GOT TO GET
TO YOUR LAPTOP.

1183
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,000
MY LAPTOP?

1184
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,600
I NEED IT
TO PROVE SOMETHING

1185
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,600
TO THE ONLY PERSON
WHO MIGHT BELIEVE ME.

1186
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,600
MARLAN CLARK?

1187
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,000
HE KNOWS
I DIDN'T SHOOT HIM.

1188
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,000
WELL, HOW ARE WE
GOING TO GET THERE?

1189
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,200
WE CAN'T TAKE
ANOTHER TAXI.

1190
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
OUR FACES ARE
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1191
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,400
STEAL A CAR.

1192
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,600
STEAL A CAR?

1193
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,600
STAND BACK.

1194
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,200
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S LOCKED?

1195
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,600
DR. MILLER,
PLEASE REPORT

1196
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,000
TO SECOND FLOOR
NURSES' STATION.

1197
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
DR. MILLER, REPORT TO

1198
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,600
THE SECOND FLOOR
NURSES' STATION.

1199
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,200
LOCALLY, IN THE MANHUNT
FOR JOHN WAHL...

1200
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
YES. CAN I HELP YOU?

1201
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,200
MARLAN CLARK.

1202
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,200
OK...HE'S, UM,

1203
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,200
DOWN TO THE LEFT.
ROOM 9.

1204
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
HEH...

1205
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,400
I THINK YOU GUYS

1206
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,400
GOT THE WRONG--
WRONG ROOM.

1207
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,000
OH, MAN...

1208
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,400
I DIDN'T SHOOT YOU,
CLARK.

1209
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,000
YOU KNOW
THAT I DIDN'T.

1210
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,400
SO WHAT?

1211
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,000
YOU CREEP.

1212
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,400
YOU'RE MAKING
THOSE WAVES.

1213
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,400
NO. WE CAN PROVE
JOHN ISN'T.

1214
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,400
DON'T TELL ME.

1215
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
TELL EDGAR.

1216
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
NO. FIRST WE'RE
GONNA TELL YOU,

1217
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,400
THEN YOU'RE
GONNA TELL HIM.

1218
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,000
WHO IS IT?

1219
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I WANT YOU TO
SEE SOMETHING.

1220
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,400
COME ON,
OPEN UP.

1221
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
HERE,
TAKE A LOOK.

1222
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,400
"IMAGINE HOW MANY LIVES
WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED

1223
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,400
"HAD A LARGE TIDAL WAVE
BEEN CREATED

1224
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,200
TO CLEAR THE BEACHES
OF NORMANDY TO..."

1225
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,200
SO DR. SCHIFF WROTE IT.
SO WHAT?

1226
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,800
THAT PROVES NOTHING.

1227
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,800
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, UH...

1228
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,800
LOOK, UH...

1229
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,200
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT SCHIFF SAID

1230
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,800
AT THE CONFERENCE
ABOUT DOOLITTLE?

1231
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,800
SURE.

1232
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,800
I THOUGHT HE HAD
MADE IT ALL UP...

1233
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,800
UNTIL I CHECKED.

1234
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,200
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.

1235
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,000
CLARK, RIGHT AFTER
I LEFT AND WENT HOME,

1236
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,600
I GOT A PHONE CALL.

1237
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,000
THE VOICE ON THE
OTHER END OF THE LINE

1238
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,600
SAID EXACTLY
THE SAME THING

1239
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,800
THAT SCHIFF SAID
IN THE ARTICLE.

1240
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,600
OH, WAHL...
STANLEY SCHIFF,

1241
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,200
HE'S GIVEN HIS LIFE
TO WORKING FOR US.

1242
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,200
YES. AND NOW HE WANTS
SOMETHING BACK.

1243
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,200
LOOK, HE KNOWS WE
TRACKED DOWN THAT ARTICLE.

1244
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,600
HE BROKE IN ON US

1245
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,000
AND TOLD US TO MEET HIM
AT THE QUEEN MARY.

1246
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
YOU'RE JUST
BLOWING MORE SMOKE.

1247
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,400
WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME?

1248
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,800
I ONLY DESIGNED
2 WARHEADS

1249
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,800
FOR UNDERWATER USE.

1250
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
THE FIRST ONE
WAS A BUST.

1251
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,800
THE SECOND ONE
WAS THE MARK-6,

1252
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
A COMPUTER-GUIDED

1253
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
THERMONUCLEAR
SUBMISSILE.

1254
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,200
SCHIFF WAS THERE
WHEN IT WAS TESTED.

1255
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,600
THE THING HAS A RANGE OF
9,000 MILES, CLARK!

1256
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,600
I THINK SCHIFF
IS USING MY MARK-6

1257
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,600
TO COLLAPSE
UNDERWATER MOUNTAINS.

1258
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,000
THAT'S WHAT'S CREATING
THESE TSUNAMIS.

1259
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,800
THANK YOU...

1260
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,600
FOR TELLING ME
HOW YOU'RE DOING IT.

1261
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,000
IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT ME!

1262
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
IF I COULD JUST GET
INTO AQUATRONICS,

1263
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,800
I COULD USE
THE MAINFRAME.

1264
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,400
I COULD DO
A THERMAL SCAN

1265
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,400
FOR RADIATION
TRACKS.

1266
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,600
OH, MAN, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1267
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,000
EVERY THERMONUCLEAR
SUBMISSILE

1268
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,400
LEAVES ITS OWN
FOOTPRINT.

1269
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,000
I KNOW THE MARK-6.
IT'S MINE.

1270
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I KNOW
ITS WEAKNESSES.

1271
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
SET IT UP, MR. CLARK.
CALL EDGAR.

1272
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,200
HEH. HE WOULDN'T
HELP YOU GUYS...

1273
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,400
EVEN IF YOU WERE DYING.

1274
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,600
THERE'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER WAVE.

1275
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,000
WHEN?

1276
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,600
IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

1277
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,800
DAMN YOU.

1278
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,200
DAMN YOU.

1279
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,600
FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.

1280
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,200
IT ISN'T HIM.

1281
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
COME ON, JESSIE,

1282
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE.

1283
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
GET YOURSELF
A SNORKEL.

1284
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,200
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

1285
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,200
I GOT TO GET
TO AQUATRONICS.

1286
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,800
WAIT. STOP.

1287
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,200
YOU DON'T NEED
THIS ANYMORE.

1288
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,200
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1289
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1290
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,200
I'M GONNA TAKE IT
UP TO CLARK.

1291
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,200
I'M GONNA HOOK IT
UP TO THE NET,

1292
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,400
AND LET HIM FIND OUT
WHAT YOU DID

1293
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,200
ON HIS OWN.

1294
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,800
LOOK, HE DOESN'T
TRUST YOU.

1295
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,200
MAYBE HE'LL
LISTEN TO ME.

1296
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,200
I--

1297
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,400
HELLO, CLARKIE.
HOW YOU DOING?

1298
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,400
MR. CLARK,
IF YOU COULD JUST--

1299
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,200
MR. CLARK?

1300
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,800
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1301
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,000
WHAT...

1302
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
MR. CLARK?

1303
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,200
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

1304
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,600
CODE BLUE! CODE BLUE!

1305
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,400
RESIDENT RIGHT NOW.
RIGHT NOW!

1306
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,800
ALL RIGHT, THE MISSILE
HAD TO STRIKE LIGHTNING FAST,

1307
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,400
BUT ITS ENGINE
IS NUCLEAR POWERED,

1308
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,400
WHICH LEAVES BEHIND
A TRAIL OF RADIATION.

1309
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,400
RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

1310
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,600
ALL RIGHT.
I'M READY.

1311
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,200
ALL RIGHT, START
THERMAL SCANNING IT.

1312
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,200
I'M GONNA GO
BACK TO JULY 1st

1313
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,600
WHEN THE FIRST WAVE HIT.

1314
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,200
LET ME SPEED IT UP
A LITTLE BIT.

1315
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
GOOD.

1316
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,600
ALL RIGHT, THERE.
THERE, YOU SEE IT?

1317
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,600
RIGHT THERE. THAT'S
OUR NUCLEAR BLAST.

1318
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,800
UH-HUH. LOOKS
VERY LOW YIELD.

1319
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,400
YEAH. STANLEY SCHIFF'S
SPECIALTY,

1320
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,400
BUT HE COULDN'T GET IT
LOW YIELD ENOUGH

1321
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,600
NOT TO LEAVE SOME
RESIDUAL RADIATION.

1322
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,200
UH-HUH. LOOK.

1323
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,600
THERE'S TIDAL WAVE
NUMBER 1

1324
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,200
HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR JAPAN.

1325
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,000
I'M GONNA
GO BACK AN HOUR,

1326
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
SEE IF WE CAN FIND
OUR SUBMISSILE.

1327
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,200
AH, THERE. YOU SEE RIGHT THERE?
THERE SHE IS.

1328
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,800
KEEP BACKING IT UP

1329
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,800
SO WE CAN SEE WHERE
HE LAUNCHED FROM.

1330
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,600
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1331
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,600
YOU SEE WHERE IT'S
HEADED BACK TO?

1332
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,000
HE LAUNCHED IT
OFF THE COAST HERE.

1333
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
WE HAVE TO SEE IF HE'S
BEEN LAUNCHING THEM ALL

1334
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,600
FROM THE SAME PLACE.

1335
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,000
UH-HUH...THERE'S
PUERTO VALLARTA...

1336
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
IT'S THE EXACT
SAME SPOT.

1337
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
WHERE THE HELL IS THIS?

1338
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,400
LET ME SEE.

1339
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,800
5 MILES STRAIGHT
OFF THE COAST.

1340
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,800
WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING THERE.

1341
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,800
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1342
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,400
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE.

1343
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,800
WELL, IT COULD BE
A SUBMARINE.

1344
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,400
STANLEY SCHIFF DOESN'T
HAVE A SUBMARINE.

1345
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,800
EVEN IF HE DID,

1346
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,200
IT WOULD STILL LEAVE
SOME SORT OF TRAIL.

1347
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,000
JOHN...WHAT IF HE'S
NOT ALONE IN THIS?

1348
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,400
HE IS. I'D BET
THE FARM ON IT.

1349
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,400
YOU ALREADY HAVE.

1350
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,800
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, LOOK.

1351
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,800
WE--WE KNOW WHERE HE'S
LAUNCHED IT FROM.

1352
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,800
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
GET A LITTLE CLOSER.

1353
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,200
CAN YOU ENHANCE IT?

1354
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,200
YEAH.

1355
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,200
MORE.

1356
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,800
MORE.

1357
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,200
YOU SEE
WHAT I'M SAYING?

1358
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,200
IF THERE WERE
A SUBMARINE,

1359
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,800
IT'D SHOW UP SOMETHING
BY NOW. MORE.

1360
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,000
OK.

1361
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,600
WHOA. ALMOST THERE.
ONE MORE TIME.

1362
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,600
THERE.

1363
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,400
I'LL BE DAMNED.

1364
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,400
YOU SEE, I KEPT
TELLING THEM,

1365
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,400
BUT THEY JUST WOULDN'T
LISTEN TO ME.

1366
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,800
EVEN WITH ITS ENGINE OFF,

1367
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,400
MY MISSILE STILL LEAVES
A NUCLEAR TRAIL.

1368
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,200
NOT A LOT, BUT SOMETHING.
JUST ENOUGH.

1369
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,800
WHERE DID IT
COME FROM?

1370
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,600
CAN YOU PULL UP A REGIONAL
TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THE AREA?

1371
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,600
UH, I THINK SO.

1372
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,600
SOMETHING WITH CITY
AND COASTAL COORDINATES.

1373
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,600
YEP.

1374
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,000
GOT IT.

1375
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,600
MY GOD.

1376
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,000
WHERE IS THIS?

1377
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,400
IT'S THE BOATYARD
RIGHT NEXT TO THE MARINA

1378
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,400
AT KING HARBOR,
HOME OF STANLEY SCHIFF.

1379
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,400
HE'S LAUNCHING
FROM THERE?

1380
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,600
I DON'T--I--

1381
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,600
I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT TO FIND OUT.

1382
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,000
I GOT TO
GET OVER THERE.

1383
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,400
SOMEHOW I GOT TO GET TO
THE COMPUTER GUIDANCE SYSTEM.

1384
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,800
MAYBE I CAN
DISARM IT ON ROUTE

1385
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,200
OR I CAN ABORT IT
WITH A SELF-DESTRUCT.

1386
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,200
LOOK, I WANT YOU
TO GET EDGAR HERE--

1387
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,600
GET EVERYONE HERE.

1388
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,600
HAVE THEM TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS.

1389
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,600
PUT IT UP
ON THE BIG SCREEN.

1390
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,600
AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

1391
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,600
GET BACK TO ME
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

1392
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,000
WHAT IF HE REFUSES?

1393
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
NO CHANCE.

1394
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
HE STILL WANTS
IT TO BE ME.

1395
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,400
HE PUT UP
A HELL OF A FIGHT.

1396
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,800
PURCELL.

1397
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,400
WHO?

1398
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,400
PATCH HER THROUGH.

1399
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,000
JESSICA WEAVER
WANTS TO TALK TO ME.

1400
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,400
THAT ONE CAUSED THE WAVE
THAT HIT JAPAN.

1401
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,400
THAT ONE'S PUERTO VALLARTA,

1402
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
AND THEY WERE ALL LAUNCHED
FROM THE SAME PLACE--

1403
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,600
RIGHT THERE.

1404
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,800
A BOATYARD
IN REDONDO BEACH.

1405
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:46,200
LOOK! ANOTHER NUCLEAR MISSILE
HAS BEEN LAUNCHED.

1406
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,400
LISBON.

1407
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,000
WAHL IS CALLING
THIS ONE?

1408
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,600
AREN'T YOU LISTENING
TO WHAT WE'RE SAYING,

1409
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,800
OR IS YOUR OWN
PERSONAL AGENDA

1410
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,000
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE TRUTH?

1411
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1412
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,200
THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUTH
I WANT HERE--

1413
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,800
THE MAN
WHO'S DOING THIS

1414
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,400
AND YOUR
INVOLVEMENT IN IT.

1415
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD
BE WORRYING ABOUT.

1416
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,200
OH, HEY,

1417
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,200
UH, STANLEY SCHIFF--

1418
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,200
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM
AROUND?

1419
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,200
HE'S NOT
ON HIS BOAT.

1420
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,200
YOU MIGHT CHECK
HIS SAIL LOFT.

1421
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,800
THAT'S THE LITTLE RED BUILDING
AROUND THE CORNER.

1422
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,200
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU.

1423
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,800
STAND BY.

1424
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,200
WE'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY
SITUATION DEVELOPING.

1425
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,200
WHEN I KNOW WHERE IT IS,
I'LL TELL YOU.

1426
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,200
WAHL IS SETTING US UP.
I KNOW IT.

1427
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,200
IT'S LAUNCHED.

1428
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,600
LATE FOR CLASS AGAIN,
MR. WAHL.

1429
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,800
STANLEY...

1430
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,000
THE MISSILE...

1431
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,200
ON ITS WAY.

1432
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,200
DON'T DO THIS,
STANLEY.

1433
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,000
DON'T DO THIS!

1434
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,600
DO WHAT, KILL YOU...

1435
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,400
OR WIPE OUT SAN DIEGO?

1436
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,400
SAN DIEGO?

1437
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,400
NOT JUST 1 WAVE, BUT 2,

1438
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,000
AND TOMORROW MAKES 3.

1439
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,400
NOT EXACTLY YOUR YOUNG JOHN
GUIDANCE DELIVERY SYSTEM,

1440
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,000
BUT IT WORKS.

1441
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
A DRONE CARRIER.

1442
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,800
OUT THERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

1443
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,200
SHE DROPS HER LOAD,
TURNS AROUND

1444
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,200
AND COMES CHUGGING
SAFELY BACK HOME AGAIN.

1445
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,600
JUST LIKE ONE OF
THOSE BATHTUB TOYS

1446
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,600
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

1447
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,400
FOR GOD'S SAKES!

1448
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,400
JOHNNY...

1449
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,200
THEY GAVE YOU
THE PRIZE,

1450
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,000
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO
REMEMBER ME.

1451
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE GOING
TO REMEMBER BOTH OF US.

1452
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,200
HOW DO YOU THINK
I GOT THE MISSILES?

1453
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,600
I PULLED A TRADE.

1454
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,800
MY SYSTEM...

1455
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1456
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,200
UGH!

1457
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,800
STANLEY, GIVE ME
THE CODE.

1458
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,800
ARRRR...

1459
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,600
GIVE ME
THE ACCESS CODE!

1460
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,200
GIVE ME THE CODE!

1461
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,600
YOU HOLD OR
I'LL USE THIS!

1462
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,400
IT'S TOO LATE, JOHNNY.

1463
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,400
THIS'LL GET
THEIR ATTENTION...

1464
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,000
AND THAT AIN'T
THE HALF OF IT.

1465
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,200
STANLEY...

1466
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,000
DON'T LAUNCH IT.

1467
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,200
I HAVE TO.

1468
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,200
PLEASE STAND BY
FOR AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE.

1469
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,200
STANLEY...

1470
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,600
I'M BEGGING YOU.
DON'T DO THIS.

1471
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,400
NO.

1472
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,200
OK. ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT!

1473
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,200
EDGAR!

1474
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,600
STANLEY...

1475
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,000
COME ON, STANLEY.

1476
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,200
EDGAR, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU JUST DID.

1477
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,000
STAY WHERE
YOU ARE, WAHL.

1478
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

1479
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,400
YOU JUST SEALED THE FATE
OF 100,000 PEOPLE, MAN!

1480
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,200
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
JUST 1 TIDAL WAVE.

1481
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,600
THERE'S GONNA BE 2.

1482
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,400
2?

1483
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,600
LOOK.

1484
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,200
MOVE AWAY
FROM THERE.

1485
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,200
AND THERE GOES
OUR ACCESS CODE.

1486
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,600
YOU SEE THIS?

1487
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,800
YOU SEE THIS
RIGHT HERE?

1488
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,000
THAT'S A MISSILE.

1489
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,600
IT'S HEADED FOR ANOTHER
UNDERWATER MOUNTAIN.

1490
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,400
WHEN IT HITS,

1491
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,400
AND IT COLLAPSES THAT
UNDERWATER SEAMOUNT,

1492
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,000
WE ARE GONNA HAVE
OURSELVES

1493
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,200
ANOTHER TIDAL WAVE, AND
IT'S GONNA MAKE LISBON

1494
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,600
LOOK LIKE
A GOOD SURFING DAY.

1495
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,400
JOHN, YOU
GOT TO STOP IT.

1496
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,600
I CAN'T.

1497
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,600
MOVE THE HELL
AWAY FROM THERE!

1498
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,600
EDGAR,
IF YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME,

1499
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,400
YOU BETTER SHOOT ME NOW.
OTHERWISE, SHUT THE HELL UP.

1500
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,600
FORGET IT. IT'S NOT
GONNA WORK, JESSIE.

1501
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,200
UM, TSUNAMI.
TRY TSUNAMI.

1502
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,000
COME ON, COME ON.

1503
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,200
WAHL...

1504
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,200
UM...WHAT ABOUT...

1505
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,200
WAIT. FUJI.

1506
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,000
IT'S USELESS.

1507
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,600
OK, UH...

1508
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,600
FORGET IT!

1509
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,000
OH, FOR GO--

1510
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,800
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

1511
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,600
OH, FOR CRYING--

1512
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,000
UH...

1513
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,400
SELF-DESTRUCT ISN'T
GOING TO DO IT.

1514
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,400
NO, I'M NOT TRYING
FOR SELF-DESTRUCT.

1515
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,000
I GOTTA SHIFT
THE MISSILE'S COURSE.

1516
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,400
CHANGE THE COURSE?
WHAT--

1517
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,200
EDGAR...HE TOLD YOU
TO BE QUIET!

1518
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,400
IF I CAN SHIFT THE COURSE
OF THE SECOND MISSILE

1519
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,000
TO MAKE IT HIT ITS TARGET
FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE,

1520
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,200
I HAVE A CHANCE
OF MAKING A WAVE

1521
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,400
THAT MUST JUST
HIT THE FIRST WAVE.

1522
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,000
COLLIDING FORCES.

1523
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
WHAT'S THAT--

1524
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
SHUT UP, EDGAR.

1525
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
IF JOHN CAN GET
A SECOND WAVE

1526
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,400
TO HIT THE FIRST ONE,

1527
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,400
THEY'LL NEUTRALIZE
EACH OTHER.

1528
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:49,800
CAN YOU DO IT?

1529
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,600
WHAT WAS IT.
WHAT WAS THE YEAR...

1530
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,800
OK. I GOT IT.

1531
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,400
UM, OK,
JOHN, JOHN, JOHN...

1532
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,400
JUST STOP
FOR A SECOND.

1533
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,400
STOP FOR A SECOND.

1534
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,800
I KNOW. WE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME.

1535
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,600
WELL, DO
SOMETHING, WAHL.

1536
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,800
EDGAR, SHUT UP.

1537
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,800
WHAT?

1538
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,800
WHAT DID STANLEY
LOVE

1539
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,600
MORE THAN ANYTHING?

1540
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,600
AH, JESSIE--

1541
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,600
COME ON, THINK!

1542
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,000
ALL RIGHT, HE, UH...
HE LOVED SCIENCE.

1543
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,600
HE WANTED FAME. HE--

1544
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,800
THE NOBEL PRIZE.

1545
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,200
NOBEL PRIZE...

1546
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,600
USELESS.

1547
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,000
OK, WAIT, STOP.
THINK A SECOND.

1548
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,400
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME!

1549
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,200
WHAT DID HE HATE?

1550
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,600
HE HATED ME.
YES.

1551
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,000
HE HATED ME.

1552
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,200
BINGO. BINGO.
HERE WE GO.

1553
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,400
HIT THE STOP BUTTON
RIGHT HERE.

1554
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,000
GOT IT.

1555
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,000
OK, NEW COORDINATES
ARE IN.

1556
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,000
WE ARE...ON TARGET.

1557
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,800
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

1558
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,200
COME ON, BABY.
COME ON, DO IT.

1559
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,600
DO IT, BABY.
DO IT.

1560
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,600
4...3...2...

1561
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,200
COME ON.
IT'S WORKING. 1...

1562
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,400
BY MY CALCULATIONS,

1563
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,400
WE SHOULD BE GETTING
A FRONT-ROW SEAT.

1564
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,600
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

1565
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,600
THIS IS FOR YOU.

1566
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,600
YEAH?

1567
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,800
YEAH.

1568
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,800
SO HOW'S IT GOING
OUT THERE?

1569
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,400
SURF UP OR RISING

1570
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,400
OR WHATEVER IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING?

1571
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,800
I SAID IT WRONG.

1572
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,400
NO.

1573
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,400
WELL?
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

1574
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,600
NO.

1575
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,000
HEY...YOU LIKE SURFIN'?
WANT TO LEARN TO SURF?

1576
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
OH, YEAH.

1577
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,800
HE'S WONDERFUL.

1578
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,400
LOOK AT THAT FACE.
