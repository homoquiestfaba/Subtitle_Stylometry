2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,295
Let's not have people coming in,
I'd like to do it without anybody in here.

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,375
Could everybody... split?
I'd love to begin, thanks.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,335
- Maybe we can keep...
- And close the door.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,815
- Keep away from the door...
- All good?

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,180
Yep.

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,300
"And never have I felt so deeply
at one and the same time"

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,856
"so detached from myself
and so present in the world"

9
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:51,380
Albert Camus.

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,580
"For Henry"

11
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,975
I wasn't good in school,

12
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,815
I didn't care for school,

13
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,575
Um... It was nice socially,
in my own experience, but...

14
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,180
I kind of just went along.

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,775
I started off as a Music Major,

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,060
Gonna be a Rock'n Roll star...

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,895
But that didn't quite worked out.

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,380
In 1985,

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,700
During the hurricane,
hurricane Gloria,

20
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,180
I was walk... I was taking a
train, into the city, to work

21
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:49,335
I was... I'd gotten into work and I was
on the phone with my brother-in-law,

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,335
who... had just started teaching.

23
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,295
And he said
that he was off from school.

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,415
Now Mike, wait a second,

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,580
You off from school for hurricane, and
I... and I'm going to the city to....

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,455
To work in an office building?

27
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,460
It's a pretty good gig, right?

28
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,775
My mother was a teacher

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,615
And I knew without
a shadow of a doubt,

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,775
from my early childhood,

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,975
That the one job I would never do
is become a teacher.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,695
Never ever, I would take...
toll cards on a turnpike,

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,020
I'll be a shepherd, anything,
rather than become a teacher.

34
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,895
And I decided to be a teacher because
I wanted to do something with my life,

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,495
Besides what I was doing,
which was driving a truck,

36
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,455
for a company, and um...

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,514
And I decided I wanted to do a
little bit better for myself,

38
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,695
so I went into teaching a little
bit, I went back to school,

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,700
And, at age of 37...

40
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,135
A friend of mine from college,

41
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,536
His aunt was the...
principal of an all-girls

42
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,060
inner-city school in
New-York, New Jersey.

43
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,855
And they were desperate for teachers,

44
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,495
So I thought "Great, I
can do this for a year,"

45
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,460
"it will keep my father for making me
get a job at Prudential,"

46
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,020
"and... then I'll figure
out what I want to do."

47
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,775
Well, they called me up and
asked me for an interview

48
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,735
And... I have to make out the job,

49
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,860
In a Junior High school in Queens

50
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,415
And I ended up...

51
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,660
Starting what...
what's now my 30th year.

52
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,420
Most of the teachers here,
at one point,

53
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,095
They believed,

54
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,820
That...
they could make the difference

55
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,700
I know how important it is to...

56
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,380
have guidance, to have...

57
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,335
someone help understand
the complexities

58
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,295
of the world that we live in.
I didn't really

59
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,140
have that... growing up.

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,220
I am money,

61
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,495
I change hands like a dollar bill
that's been robbed by a lamp

62
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,815
Men and genie appeared
in a cry of love

63
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,495
with volume

64
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,980
But the tears were all for myself

65
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:37,397
And that's when it all went wrong

66
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,140
* Phone ringing *

67
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:08,260
* Beep *

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,935
Hi, Lupe, its Dean Vargus here.

69
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,540
I'm sick and I won't be
coming in today, alright?

70
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,277
* Beep *

71
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:21,895
Get to the point, Dr. Hart,
I've got a school to run.

72
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,575
The state's score's gone
down the last three years,

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,454
You're not delivering...

74
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:26,455
Don't pretend like you
don't know the game,

75
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,655
You earmarked my school for the
worst kids in the district...

76
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,775
These kids deserve an
education, don't you agree?

77
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,455
I agree. You're jerking
off on wasting my time.

78
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,095
Get to the point, Dr. Hart...
We need consensus builders,

79
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,375
a new methodology...

80
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,055
You're corporatizing the system.

81
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,895
No, we're cleaning house.

82
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,735
The superintendent feels
it's time you step down.

83
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,660
Babe, you got some fucking nerve coming
into my yard with a heart fucking sell.

84
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,300
Carol, it was a time when
you were an educator,

85
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,300
You were very well respected.

86
00:05:57,803 --> 00:05:59,180
Why don't you go out on top?

87
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,940
Allright. Everybody sit down and shut
up, or I start pulling out the referrals.

88
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,980
Sit.
Sit down.

89
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,740
I am starting the DVD.

90
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,420
I am starting the DVD.

91
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,655
- <i>Barth</i> or <i>Barthes</i>
- <i>Barth</i>

92
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,655
Mr. Barth, ma'am.

93
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,460
Mr. Barth, Henry Barth.

94
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,455
So you've taken long
term assignments at...

95
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:58,957
"Locke" and "McArthur".

96
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,220
The "fringe".

97
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,540
Well, that's where the works are.

98
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,740
This a month-long assignment,
until I can fill it permanently.

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,976
I asked to meet with you
because you come highly

100
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:12,220
recommended as the best
sub on the call sheet.

101
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,260
That's a somewhat
dubious endorsement.

102
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,455
I agree, Mr. Barth.

103
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,295
You will find <i>many</i> of your students
functioning well below the grade level.

104
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,620
That's your task to tray
and get them caught up.

105
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,620
Teach the curriculum, most importantly.
Understood?

106
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:46,455
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

107
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,975
I'm Mr. Barth,

108
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Those of you who haven't heard,
this is English 11A.

109
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,860
Listen up, I have one rule.

110
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,940
Just one.

111
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,940
If you don't wish to be here,

112
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,597
Don't come.

113
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,495
Dude, what does that mean?

114
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,500
It's not dude, it's Mr. Barth.

115
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,455
The S is silent.

116
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,735
- You're fucking gay
- Marcus, shut up!

117
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,060
No, you shut up!

118
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,860
You dike bitch!

119
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,917
Hey Marcus, guess what?

120
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:18,935
What?

121
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,095
You're free to leave.

122
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,015
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

123
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,917
- A'right, yo...
- Catch you later, man!

124
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,716
What's the fuck, do you want
me to go to the Dean's Office?

125
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,500
I don't care where you go.

126
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,655
Everyone, pull out a sheet of paper.

127
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,157
I would like to assess where
your individual writing skills are...

128
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:35,495
What if he got no paper?

129
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,815
Okay, here is the situation:

130
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,895
You're dead.

131
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,744
Alright, write a brief but
detailed essay about...

132
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,716
Hey jackass,...

133
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,335
I asked you a fucking question!

134
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,135
About what a friend or a parent

135
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,535
might say about you
during your funeral.

136
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,757
- Okay? You have 30 minutes.
- Oh shit...

137
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,820
I asked you a motherfucking
question, didn't I?

138
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:06,895
Anything else?

139
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,100
You'd better back the fuck up before
I fucking rock your shit.

140
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,860
That bag...
It doesn't have any feelings...

141
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,380
It's empty.

142
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,300
I don't have any feeling
you can hurt either.

143
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,460
Okay?
I understand you're angry.

144
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,855
I used to be very angry too, okay.

145
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,215
I get it. You have no reason to
be angry with me, because...

146
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,615
I am one the few people that's here
trying to give you an opportunity.

147
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,580
Now I'm going to ask
you to just sit down

148
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,237
and do your best.

149
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,095
And I'll give you a piece of paper.

150
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,300
How's that?

151
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,300
Can I get a fucking pen too?

152
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,837
Kids don't have any attention span.

153
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,455
They're bored.

154
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,380
So how are you supposed to reel them in
with classic literature if they don't...

155
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,620
If they don't believe...
that you...

156
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
have something meaningful to share?

157
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,140
Thank you.

158
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,180
Why did you threw Marcus
out of class but not Jerry?

159
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,495
Well I had to make an
example out of somebody.

160
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,895
And Marcus verbally assaulted you
and that's not allowed in my classroom.

161
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,060
What they say to me is immaterial.

162
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,060
What's your name?

163
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,060
Meredith.

164
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,957
Nice to meet you, Meredith.

165
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,117
So you really don't care
what the kid say to you?

166
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,140
Perhaps I've gotten used to it.

167
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,015
I wish I could be that strong.

168
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,677
It doesn't take strength, Meredith.

169
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:52,580
You gotta... understand that unfortunately
most of people lack self-awareness

170
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,375
You should really keep that in mind as you
head into the trenches of second period.

171
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,780
You're gonna meet them again,
at every age.

172
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,335
I want to see the Principle!

173
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,575
That's her, mom.

174
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,375
You're the bitch that expelled my baby?
And for what?

175
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,175
- Excuse me, maybe you would like to...
- Because you can't handle it?

176
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,114
Bitch why are you here?
You want to be at home where I

177
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,175
am every day?!
I don't have time for this bullshit!

178
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,615
- Keep your voice down!
- Why are you here?

179
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,575
Hey, Ma'am. Calm down.

180
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,215
We'll go talk about this
in the Dean's Office.

181
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,335
I ain't going nowhere with you

182
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,015
Look, miss, I know you're angry...

183
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,277
but they won't listen to you,
you need to talk to me.

184
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,655
- Racist bitch, I'm gonna sue your ass...
- Okay, come on, ladies...

185
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,997
This way...

186
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,615
- Ladies,...
- What happened?

187
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,616
Bitch, you give me any
more shit in class and I'm

188
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,740
getting my nigger's fucking
gang rape your ass!

189
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,375
Excuse me.

190
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,620
Are you new here?

191
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,380
Yes, first day.

192
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,935
Welcome.

193
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,500
That was quite a scene back there.

194
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,700
I was a little stunned.

195
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,380
But it's actually safe here.

196
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,100
Sorry, I'm Miss Madison.

197
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,620
Henry, Henry Barthes.

198
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,860
Whatever is on my mind,
I say it as I feel it

199
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,215
I am truthful to myself.

200
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,860
I'm young

201
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,340
And I'm old
at the bottom of that soul

202
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,540
So many times

203
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,300
I am hardfaced, I am gone

204
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
I am just like you

205
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,740
Patricia?!

206
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,980
Patricia Patricia

207
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,301
Patricia

208
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,575
- Hello?
- Henry, it's Rita from the hospital.

209
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,335
He's done it again,
you need to get down here.

210
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,735
Bastards, leave me alone!

211
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,255
Why aren't you handling this?

212
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,575
I can't get him out!

213
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,620
- You come and get him...
- Patricia?

214
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,261
Thanks.

215
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,140
Grandpa, come on, it's Henry.
Open the door.

216
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,495
Patricia?

217
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,420
No, it's Henry, it's Henry.

218
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,255
- Who?
- It's Henry.

219
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,220
Grandpa, please, open...
open the door...

220
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,180
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

221
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,637
I thought that you were your mom.

222
00:13:58,483 --> 00:13:59,855
You're dressed okay,

223
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,300
Were you going somewhere?

224
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,055
Well I'm going to work.

225
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,775
You are retired.

226
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,660
You are retired, okay?

227
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,060
It's very very late so I need
you to go to sleep, okay?

228
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,780
Let's go to bed.

229
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,500
How are you doing, huh?

230
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,540
Some old people sleep
a lot before they die.

231
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,060
Isn't that silly?

232
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,495
Everything okay?

233
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,535
You shut up!

234
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,661
You listen.

235
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,535
I know you're just under-educated job

236
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,020
Passing the time with
these old dying people.

237
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,295
But I'm paying for
his assisted living

238
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,735
And you're not assisting him!

239
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,637
I told you, take the lock
off of his bathroom door!

240
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,615
You know how he gets
at night, he forgets

241
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,197
So you need to be there for him.

242
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:13,855
To make him feel safe.

243
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,535
Let me be very clear here:

244
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,180
You stop neglecting his needs

245
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,740
Or I will start fucking with yours!

246
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,660
I will have you fired!

247
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,660
That is going to be your family,

248
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,380
Your children, are
gonna be at risk!

249
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,860
You got it?!

250
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,460
Don't you ever make me come down
here again at this hour,

251
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,900
Okay?

252
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,900
Give me the fucking money!

253
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,575
You heard me.
Give me the fucking money!

254
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,860
- What?
- Give me the fucking money now!

255
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,295
You think I like you?

256
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,335
Give me the fucking money!

257
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,940
- You want money?
- Now!

258
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,935
Why are you following me?

259
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,255
I'm not. It's late, you should
be home, it's a school night.

260
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,535
What? Are you crazy now?

261
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,236
- What the fuck is your deal, huh?
- Keep away from me.

262
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,260
Why'd you let the guy
beat shit out of me?

263
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,655
Huh? You just sat there, like
a fucking lemon or something!

264
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,975
Excuse me,
I don't want to talk to you.

265
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,197
You don't think that there
is something wrong with that?

266
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,375
Listen,

267
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,295
Little kid, I don't know how old you
were when it all went wrong.

268
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,935
But this isn't
the fucking answer, okay.

269
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,215
Go figure it out, because you're
gonna get really old, really quick.

270
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,055
- You know that?
- Why are you so mean to me? Huh?

271
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,735
You don't think that I have feelings?

272
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,460
Do you? Do you have feelings?

273
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,615
Listen, pa...
I mean between you and me...

274
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,780
You look like you got
more problems than me.

275
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,095
Oh really?

276
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,994
Yeah, really.
So, come on, I'll make it better.

277
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,015
What are you doing?
Get off, please.

278
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,175
Nothing, I'm just offering
to hang out if you want...

279
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,135
- I don't wanna hang out with you
- I don't know you seem kinda lonely,

280
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,940
Maybe we go back
to your place, just... relax...

281
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,100
You're afraid you'll like it?

282
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,274
I'm afraid you've been
fucked and thrown away

283
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:11,095
so many times, you've
gotten used to it.

284
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,221
Fuck you, man!

285
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,060
Fuck off, queer.

286
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,020
Have a good night, yeah.

287
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,775
Yeah, yeah, just walk away? Hey?

288
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,700
Where are you going?

289
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,180
"He just fucks their shit up and..."

290
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,735
"the ladies cried for me..."

291
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,540
"at the funeral."

292
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,095
"Because I ain't around no more to,"

293
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,237
"to dick that split up..."

294
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:52,660
"raw and shit..."

295
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,455
"And my boys all get faded..."

296
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,460
"Blazing that skunk shit and fuck."

297
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,780
Tony V.

298
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,180
You know, it's funny:
I spend a lot of time

299
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,580
trying to not have to deal,

300
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,335
To not really commit.

301
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,060
I am a substitute teacher,

302
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,420
there is no real
responsibility to teach.

303
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,255
The responsibility
is to maintain order,

304
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,700
make sure nobody kills
anybody in your classroom,

305
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,735
and then they get to the next period.

306
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,660
"She used to be a sweet girl."

307
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,415
"She never seemed dissatisfied
with her life..."

308
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,175
"and why should she have been?"

309
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,820
"Her mother and I gave her
everything she needed..."

310
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,357
"So why did she become so angry,"

311
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,175
"so miserable
and mean all of a sudden?"

312
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,455
"We don't know."

313
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,820
"Frankly, it doesn't reflect on us."

314
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,940
"We were good parents."

315
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,295
"But still, she repaid
us for all we've done"

316
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,757
"by killing herself."

317
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,015
"Stupid selfish child"

318
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,460
"Now she'll never
get into Princeton."

319
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,740
No name.

320
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,015
"Hi, it's Dean Vargus again"

321
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,100
"I can't do it anymore"

322
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,117
"I... I quit!"

323
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,500
Oh, if it isn't
the lovely Dr. Parker!

324
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,095
Would you like a happy pill
to help you through the day?

325
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,596
They're yummy.

326
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,220
I need you to fill in for
Dean Vargus' second period.

327
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,340
I am worried about you, Charlie.

328
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,060
I just... really love watching
you leave the room.

329
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,860
Haha, Mr. Seaboldt, he maintains
a sense of humor.

330
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,277
I think the sense of humor is key,
I don't possess it...

331
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,380
I mean, I do...

332
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,935
in a tragic sort of way

333
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,535
Whatcha doing here, Mr. Sea?

334
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,655
Um, filling in for Dean Vargus.

335
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,175
Vargus is a bitch!

336
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,455
Talk shit,
and you get slapped like a bitch.

337
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,335
You're not gonna give
me no detention neither.

338
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,077
Or I'm gonna unfuck
your shit uptight.

339
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,455
Motherfucker.

340
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,495
Un... shit... No, unfuck your
shit uptight motherfucker.

341
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,015
Wow... that is, I mean really poetic.

342
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,495
I mean that's truly, what... lyrical.

343
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,935
You should take that on stage,

344
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,597
I mean that shit sells itself.

345
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:23,277
***

346
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,020
I'm going to unfuck your
shit, uptight, motherfucker.

347
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,215
I'll tell you ***

348
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,415
I'll unfuck your shit uptight...

349
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,980
I'll unfuck it right
uptight, up your ass...

350
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,495
You motherfucker!

351
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,420
I am going to unfuck your shit, uptight,
you motherfucker!

352
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,255
I'll tell you what, um...

353
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,735
Why don't you have a seat...

354
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,535
okay, and then um... I'll be back shortly
and we'll discuss your bright future.

355
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,740
Okay, my man?

356
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,940
I mean, my motherfucker.

357
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,780
Okay, Mae West?

358
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,455
Ellen, can I see your nipples?

359
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,180
What? No!

360
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,820
Wrong.

361
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,615
Actually, I can.

362
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,255
See, that's the whole point.
You have to wear bra to school.

363
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,175
Look, Mr. Seaboldt,
I'm just being me.

364
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,620
I don't tell <i>you</i> how to dress,
so you don't tell <i>me</i>.

365
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,020
Capisce?

366
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,940
Ellen, you know what that is?

367
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,980
It's a beautiful picture
of a sunset in Hawaii.

368
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,637
It's really pretty, isn't it?

369
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,740
Now, that one...

370
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,535
Do you know what <i>that</i> is?

371
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,015
That's a vagina
infected with gonorrhea.

372
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,375
That's fucking gross!

373
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,415
Yes, very.
So, you see,

374
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,335
when you come to school
dressed like that, you give...

375
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,695
you give out the wrong signal. Don't you
want people to treat you with respect?

376
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,495
Yo, I get respect. I don't give
it up to every dick in my face.

377
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,100
Every dick in your face.

378
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,140
That's respectful.

379
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,735
Put this on,
wear that for the rest...

380
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,460
I said,
wear that for the rest of the day.

381
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,637
Okay?

382
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,260
Can I go now?

383
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,460
I suppose you can, I mean...

384
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,900
if we're done.
Are we done?

385
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,980
- We're done.
- We're done.

386
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,420
Another student saved...

387
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,780
Come out of the bathroom, Grandma!

388
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,260
Come on, grandma, open the door.

389
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,780
Hi Grandpa.

390
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,700
Grandpa.

391
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,620
Grandpa?

392
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,460
You okay?

393
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,375
What is it Grandpa?

394
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,220
It's Henry, Grandpa.

395
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:48,260
Grandpa, it's Henry.

396
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,655
- Who?
- Are you in pain?

397
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,180
No, I... I pissed myself

398
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,060
Come on grandma, open the door!

399
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,277
Excuse me!

400
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:03,535
Excuse me?

401
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,655
- Can you come in here, please?
- You had a little accident?

402
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,620
- Yeah...
- You should...

403
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,255
See, we've taken care of it. See?

404
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,077
You're okay. Alright?

405
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,615
You doing any writing, Grandpa?

406
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,820
Been doing writing? In the journals?

407
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
No, my life...

408
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,700
My life isn't worth memoirs...

409
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,940
It's OK, it's okay...

410
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,900
I didn't want to go... off like this.

411
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,895
I hate being a burden.

412
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,300
You're not a burden, okay?

413
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,655
Not a burden.

414
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,700
Sure, knew you'd like coming here...

415
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,460
Your mother came by, today.

416
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,060
Have you spoken to her lately?

417
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,220
No.

418
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,260
Would you tell her I'm fine?

419
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,500
You always say you're fine,
but I know you hide things from me.

420
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,620
You've always been closed off.

421
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,175
Ever since you were an kid.

422
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,780
Why is that?

423
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,740
Why?

424
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,015
Ah... you're upset.
I shouldn't say these things to you...

425
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,740
- I don't mean to make you...
- You haven't upset me,

426
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,055
Grandpa

427
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,140
Listen, I don't want to
talk about the past.

428
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,180
You and I remember
it very differently.

429
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,060
Just rest, okay?
Close your eyes, I'm here.

430
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,940
- I'll be here with you.
- When you stop coming, Henry,

431
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,180
I'll die.

432
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,660
Fuck.

433
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,460
You got a smoke?

434
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,020
No, I don't have a smoke.

435
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,260
Where did you go, huh?

436
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,575
- What are you gonna do now?
- What are you gonna do, kid?

437
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,020
I don't know.

438
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,380
Can you lend me ten bucks?

439
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,900
Come on, man. I'm hungry.

440
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,020
I may have something
to eat at my place.

441
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,300
Come in, wash your hands.

442
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,540
There's soap over there.

443
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,820
Sit down.

444
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,580
Real nice place you got.

445
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,580
Thanks.

446
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,695
You got anything stronger?

447
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,260
Eat your sandwich.

448
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:25,380
Hey, hold on man!

449
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,260
It's a hundred bucks.

450
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,020
Relax...

451
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,820
What?

452
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,575
Have you been raped recently?

453
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,917
Why do you care?

454
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,500
I'm not sure that I do but ***

455
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,220
I haven't put something on.

456
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,180
Look, I got to get back.

457
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,060
Back?

458
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,700
Back where?

459
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,455
Listen, buddy...

460
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,815
You don't got the money,
it's cool, i mean...

461
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,340
I like you.

462
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,935
I'll blow you for 50.

463
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,060
Listen to me, knock off
the bullshit, okay?

464
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,140
Come in the bathroom.

465
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,140
It's going to sting a little bit...

466
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:04,420
Why are you doing this?

467
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,900
Take a shower.

468
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,940
- This is fresh towel...
- Thanks.

469
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,620
Go to sleep.

470
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,295
Hello, this is Dr. Parker.

471
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,575
My son's ADHD, and I looked it up online
and that's what he's got.

472
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,175
Now you gotta give
him his free laptop.

473
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,660
Mr. Kevin, your son
Oliver's injured students.

474
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,255
His problems are behavioral.

475
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,175
Hey, my kid's got a disability,
and he's not learning anything.

476
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,375
And it's your fault!

477
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,855
- Hey hey...
- What are you doing?

478
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,860
What is the matter with you?

479
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,900
As it is, our resources are emaciated and
I have real LD kids that need my attention.

480
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:04,317
He's always mad, all the time, because
he's not getting the services he need.

481
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:07,935
"No Child Left Behind" promises me my
right, you'll be hearing from my lawyer!

482
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,061
Mister...

483
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,780
Hey, what are you doing?

484
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,540
What is this?

485
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,980
What is this, funny?
Get to class, get to class right now.

486
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,580
What's the joke?
I didn't got the joke, huh?

487
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,060
Is this funny? Does that look good to
you? You like hurting animals? Huh?!

488
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,175
Is that what you like to do? Yes, you do.
You like hurting animals. You like this?!

489
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,375
Come here, go, let's go, come on.

490
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,860
Walk.

491
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,834
Mr. Raymond, studies
have shown that kids who

492
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,335
are proned to hurting
animals at an early age

493
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,735
eventually fall into a
high percentage of adults

494
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,700
who may fail to develop even
the most basic feeling for people.

495
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,380
Evan,

496
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,580
how do you feel about this?

497
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,940
I feel...

498
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,660
trapped.

499
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,900
Like the cat.

500
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,180
Fuck.

501
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,877
Who are you? Hey, what? What?!

502
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:30,815
Did you pay her?
Did you pay her?

503
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,456
Did you pay her?

504
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:34,220
Yeah alright, here, yeah
yeah alright, here...

505
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,055
- Alright, here...
- What are you paying me for, huh?!

506
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,420
Wasn't in my mouth!

507
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,317
Get fuck out of here,
get out of here!

508
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:43,484
Fuck!

509
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,100
Don't hurt me!

510
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,340
Here...

511
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,420
Change your sheets!

512
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,820
How do you do it, kid?

513
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,620
Please, don't be mad at me.

514
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,980
I'm not mad at you.

515
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,660
And don't think about, you and me,

516
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,015
I won't do it anymore.

517
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,175
I promise.

518
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:29,220
You don't need to promise me

519
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,580
Okay, don't promise to me.
Whatever it is,

520
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,020
that you feel that you need to do,

521
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,620
you do it.

522
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,420
But you don't do it here!

523
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,701
Okay?

524
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,060
What are you doing there?

525
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,300
Don't you knock?

526
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,700
So what is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?

527
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,295
Why don't you paint
something cheerful?

528
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,855
Like happy with color.

529
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,535
What do you want from me, dad? Besides
for me to have been born with a penis.

530
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,855
I don't work all day...

531
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,855
To have my night ruining
by your teen angst.

532
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,335
*** might get you a full-right to
Stanford if your were some minority...

533
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,455
I am not going to support you...

534
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,815
and your little creative habits!

535
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,855
Okay? I've had it with all
your little art projects...

536
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,535
that are going nowhere!

537
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,620
You always know what to say, Dad.

538
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,940
No, if... if you grew your hair up,

539
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,340
and... lose some weight,

540
00:36:27,243 --> 00:36:29,997
you could attract a nice boy
and, who knows...

541
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,900
There should be a...

542
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,860
prerequisite...

543
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,940
a curriculum for being a parent
before, people, attempt.

544
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,340
Don't try this at home.

545
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,220
Take these.

546
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,020
What are those?

547
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,340
You're supposed to ask me
<i>before</i> you take them.

548
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,637
They are vitamins and aspirin.

549
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,580
At some point, hum...

550
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,900
You should get an HIV test.

551
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,460
At some point.

552
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,940
Why were you crying on the bus?

553
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,660
Go to sleep.

554
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,095
A friend of yours?

555
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,900
A friend? Hum... No... No, no.

556
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,877
Of course he had no friends,
he was a....

557
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:09,557
Total asshole.

558
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,495
What was his problem?

559
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,895
He chose a vocation that
did not choose him...

560
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,695
I mean, he spent his whole career...

561
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,860
<i>"casting pearls before swine"</i>,
he talked like that...

562
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,140
***

563
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:28,900
He tried to purge Steinbeck and Faulkner
from our required reading list.

564
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,074
Oh yes.

565
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,255
Let it be said, from the
safety of his sabbatical ***

566
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,220
you can't do no more harm.

567
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,740
How did he die?

568
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,437
Who knows and... who cares?

569
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,117
Lupe, It's trudgery,
this life...

570
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,317
A detention, suspension,
expulsion...

571
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:01,597
the staff meetings,
the papers cuts,

572
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,455
the vacant parents,
their vicious kids,

573
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,375
they're the drags, Lupe.

574
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,300
They spat on my soul.

575
00:39:08,643 --> 00:39:10,735
This humiliation will stop.

576
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,597
Discipline must be restored,
these kids have us on the run.

577
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,860
***

578
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,215
It's fucking madness!

579
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,135
Like, every child has value?

580
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,895
Is a winner and worthier
*** for education?

581
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,175
Fucking kids who have
no desire, no fire,

582
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,305
no mind to peace...
*Adolf Hitler speech*

583
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,500
"Assimilate"

584
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,060
What does that mean?

585
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,215
To take something in.

586
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,220
Okay, excellent. To absorb.

587
00:40:02,563 --> 00:40:05,180
"Ubiquitous"

588
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,197
Anyone?

589
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,975
Everywhere, all the time.

590
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,580
So what is...

591
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,780
"ubiquitous assimilation"

592
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:22,260
Always absorbing everything,
everywhere, all the time?

593
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,740
Well done, George.

594
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,500
How are you to imagine anything?

595
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,477
If the images are always
provided for you.

596
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,100
Who here read "1984" last year?

597
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,741
Good.

598
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,317
Anyone?

599
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,620
Meredith?

600
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,095
Having two opposing beliefs at once

601
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,975
and believing that both are true.

602
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,455
Excellent Meredith.

603
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,135
Why do you always suck his
dick, you fucking kiss ass?

604
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,540
To deliberately believe in lies,

605
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,620
while knowing they are false.

606
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,917
Examples of this, in everyday life.

607
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,260
Oh, I...

608
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,580
I need to be pretty... to be happy.

609
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,140
I need surgery... to be pretty.

610
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,780
I need to be thin...
famous... fashionable.

611
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,220
Our young men,

612
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,260
today,

613
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,877
are being told that women...
are whores...

614
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,980
bitches...
things to be screwed...

615
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,780
beaten...

616
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,860
shit on...

617
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,621
ashamed...

618
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,260
This is a marketing holocaust.

619
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:46,180
24 hours a day, for the
rest of our lives,

620
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,340
the powers that be
are hard at work...

621
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,917
dumbing us to death!

622
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,815
So, to defend ourselves...

623
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,740
and fight against assimilating this
dullness into our thought processors.

624
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:04,340
We must learn to read,

625
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,860
to stimulate our own imagination.

626
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:08,397
To cultivate...

627
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,900
our own consciousness,

628
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,780
our own belief systems.

629
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,935
We all need these skills.

630
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,620
To defend,

631
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,220
To preserve,

632
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,220
Our own minds.

633
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,620
Just very carefully, that's perfect.

634
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,220
Great.

635
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,180
Look...

636
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,157
You just made your own tessellation.

637
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,896
Wow.

638
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:51,540
I don't care what they
say, you're doing great.

639
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,380
I had a hard time with maths too,
it takes time.

640
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,060
Wow, that is damn cool.

641
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,820
Hi guys,

642
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,940
thanks for staying late...

643
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,940
all... 15 or 20 of you.

644
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,096
Today we will be presented
with new course work,

645
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:10,620
engineered to boost state
exams performance,

646
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,780
as mandated by "No
Child Left Behind".

647
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,180
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure to be here.

648
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,336
I've come today with some
edifying materials to

649
00:43:27,461 --> 00:43:29,860
help your matriculated
and non-matric students

650
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,495
better prepare for the
upcoming state exams this May.

651
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,877
Let me start by stating
I love teachers...

652
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:43,540
I love what you do,
what you stand for,

653
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,700
You guys are the real heroes.

654
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,500
Now the one thing I've learned
in all my years in the private sector,

655
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,580
Is that...
real estate generate revenue.

656
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,420
And burgeoning property values
will be this school saving grace.

657
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,917
But your school's low test scores,

658
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,575
Are bringing down home resell
value in this neighborhood

659
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,100
during a market already in decline.

660
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,375
We gotta get scores up,

661
00:44:10,643 --> 00:44:12,580
new families in our district,

662
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,180
and more motivated
kids in your school.

663
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,215
And I'm not placing any blame...

664
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,455
Excuse me, are you here
to sell some tests materials...

665
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,215
or to air your concerns
as a property owner?

666
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,700
Listen, umm... I am curious.

667
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,957
Are you giving away pop-corn
with this crap that you're pushing?

668
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,495
This faculty has spent their lives
on the boards and you tell us...

669
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,575
that our careers are
about resell value?

670
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,317
Bullshit!
Give him hell, lady.

671
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,295
- Storm the gates.
- Don't oversimplify, ma'am,

672
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,517
That's a *** you can't afford.

673
00:44:41,683 --> 00:44:42,437
That sounds like a threat.

674
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,405
Can you... that's enough,
will you please sit down?

675
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,397
That's enough.

676
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:47,300
- Could you please sit down...
- Can we have some order here, please...

677
00:44:49,843 --> 00:44:51,580
Dr. Hart was right,

678
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,455
- Your school's the pride of the district.
- Yeah, you bet pal.

679
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,997
Could you finish your pitch?
We'd like to go home.

680
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,855
What's your hurry, huh?

681
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,140
I hear they're putting
you out to pasture...

682
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,180
So enjoy running this relic
for a few more months

683
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,860
You're fossil
and you're fucking done!

684
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,540
Ever dread going home?

685
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,180
Lately I don't know what to do with
myself when I'm not in the classroom.

686
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,980
Some Friday afternoons,
I'm afraid to go home...

687
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,460
Afraid of all that time alone...

688
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,797
Yeah

689
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,514
My mother hates my
father passionately...

690
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,615
I'm there for them on
a permanent basis...

691
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,194
Watch a lot of TV...

692
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:44,895
Probably the only time
I don't feel naked...

693
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,197
Not a temporary one...

694
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:48,975
- I teach for selfish reasons...
- My mother was a Miss Madison...

695
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,415
- You're better than that...
- I need control...

696
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,975
- I need those kids more than I should...
- She does this great...

697
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,295
Her moments in the school
where all the moments...

698
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,495
It must *** up there
in front of them...

699
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,380
That's it, you ever had...

700
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,420
So what's your story?

701
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,460
My story?

702
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,940
I'm just umm...

703
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,815
I'm just taking one thing at a time.

704
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,717
Why are you wasting your life, you know
something to dodge?

705
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,500
I teach every day, I mean, when we...

706
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,140
I mean, you don't really know me.

707
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,460
So what happened to you?

708
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,860
You don't want something
more permanent?

709
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,855
- Hi.
- Where have you been?

710
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,620
What? I was out.

711
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,540
- With a colleague.
- A boy or a girl?

712
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,820
A woman.

713
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,180
You make me feel like so stupid,
why do you treat me like a kid?

714
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,260
Well, you are a kid.

715
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,416
I'm sorry, I wasn't
expecting this.

716
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,940
All you had to do is tell me
you're gonna be home later.

717
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,780
Well, back up, alright?

718
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,020
I am not beholden to you, okay?
I mean, you're welcome to stay here...

719
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,175
But, you don't have to get
expectations of me, alright?

720
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,095
This is a temporary thing, you...
you're able to stay here, but...

721
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,095
eventually you're gonna have to go,
you understand that?

722
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,100
- I think it's important that...
- It's clear.

723
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,540
I get it, you want me to go now?

724
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,060
I got better things to do
than clean up the stuff.

725
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,060
I can't believe you made dinner.

726
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,140
From what?

727
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,820
Groceries, from the grocery store...

728
00:48:07,243 --> 00:48:11,340
Wow, it's really nice kid.

729
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,500
It's been a long time since
somebody cooked me a well-cooked meal.

730
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,780
Thank you Erica.

731
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,975
We all have problems, we all have
things that we're dealing with, right?

732
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,420
And we all...

733
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,900
take them home with us at night,

734
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,180
take them to work with
us in the morning.

735
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,197
I think that helplessness,
that realization,

736
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,020
that... foreboding of...

737
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,055
being adrift into sea

738
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,980
It's no...
<i>bowie</i>, no safety net.

739
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:02,580
When you thought you'd be the one
throwing the bowie.

740
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,620
Hi?

741
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,615
- Anything for dinner?
- Tell me all about it from the beginning.

742
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,335
- You don't care.
- Oh, no...

743
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,477
So untrue, love.

744
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,340
You are so condescending...

745
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,020
Give me a kiss.

746
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,717
Come on, go on talking,
it'll sort everything.

747
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,740
- Come.
- Stop it.

748
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,700
Do you remember...
when I bought you this?

749
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,220
That beautiful summer in Venice,

750
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,300
before I traveled through a resign to...
reviving old passions, hum?

751
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,660
"You suck!"

752
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,100
- Flubby?
- Yeah.

753
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,176
Grandpa, are you doing any writing?
In your journal?

754
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:15,700
No...

755
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,220
I don't remember much,

756
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,620
and lost the habit.
You can't think in this place

757
00:52:25,323 --> 00:52:28,340
You can't make new memories.

758
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,020
Thank you.

759
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,460
- Are you alright?
- What?

760
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,095
You see me?
You see me standing here?

761
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,060
Yes, I see you.

762
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,300
Oh God, it's so relentless,
thank you.

763
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:16,860
Carol, there's no nice way for me to do
this. I've spoken with the superintendent,

764
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,335
he's agreed to let you ***
at the rest of the year.

765
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,260
It is what it is. Take your pension
and go to that beautiful house of yours.

766
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,500
Send Mr. Dearden my best...

767
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,300
Haven't you ever... had enough?

768
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:40,140
Haven't you ever just wanted
to tell someone to fuck off?

769
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,420
I think I'm sick, I don't know...

770
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,495
- Huh?
- I crossed a line today...

771
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,220
I mean the whole...
the whole thing is fucked.

772
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,540
The whole thing is fucked, is it not?

773
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,940
What up, Dr. Parker?

774
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,117
Can we get this over with?
I got shit to do.

775
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,294
Okay, so what are your
plans after high school

776
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:04,135
Missy, since you're
not going to college?

777
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,735
I don't know, pfff...

778
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,660
Hang out with my boyfriend,
do some modeling shit...

779
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,855
Be in my friend's band...

780
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,455
Well, I have your *** grade report.
Do you know what it says?

781
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,660
- F, F, F, F... - F.
- F, F, F... yeah.

782
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,975
Do you know what that means?
It means you don't care.

783
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,460
You're brilliant.

784
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,540
Can I go now?

785
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,860
God, you are a shallow,
disgusting, creature.

786
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,060
You want to know the truth?

787
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,735
One: you're not gonna be in a band,

788
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,060
or a model Missy, because
you have no ambition.

789
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,734
With no skills, you'll be
competing with 80 % of the U.S.

790
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:47,895
workforce for a minimum wage job

791
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,655
which you'll work out for
the rest of your life

792
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,415
Until you're replaced by a computer.

793
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,175
- I don't care
- Two:.

794
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,615
The only talent you'll ever have
is getting men to fuck you.

795
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,797
Your life will basically
become a carnival of pain.

796
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,420
And when you can't stand it,
not one more day,

797
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,660
not one more hour,

798
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,540
It will get worse, much worse!

799
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,776
Everyday I came in this
office and I listened

800
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:14,300
your kids to shit-off
all of yourself!

801
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:20,357
It is so easy to be careless,
it takes courage and character to care!

802
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,620
None of you have any
of these qualities.

803
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,580
- Get out! Just get out! Get out!
- Fuck you!

804
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,535
- I'm a total burn out.
- You are not.

805
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,185
I am.

806
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,957
I mean I don't know how you
make it through the day.

807
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,620
Listen. Seriously, why do you
think I take these pills for?

808
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,820
I mean, that's a rubber room in here.

809
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,314
If I didn't take these
things, I'd be...

810
00:57:50,439 --> 00:57:52,775
I'd become a mass murderer
on half of these parents.

811
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,020
And I'd be helping them throwing their
fucking kids out the window, come on...

812
00:57:56,563 --> 00:57:57,620
You're the best.

813
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,140
I'll tell you my opinion, the worst
thing about this job...

814
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,780
is that nobody says "thank you".

815
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,620
- No...
- No.

816
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,735
Well, I am here to say thank you

817
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,700
For doing a job that none
of us could do. None of us.

818
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:21,420
Have I ever told you that you're
the only person I have to talk to?

819
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,295
- Hi, Henry.
- What happened?

820
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,180
They called your house,

821
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,220
- Your grandfather felt some chest pains.
- And?

822
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,700
The doctor says he's stable.

823
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,300
He doesn't have a lot of time.

824
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,797
I'm so sorry, Henry.

825
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,060
How long...
have you been here?

826
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,100
Since this morning. I didn't know
how to get a hold of you.

827
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,740
I don't know where you work.

828
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,940
Been here the whole day with him?

829
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,340
Hi Grandpa.

830
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,660
Still hanging in there I see, huh?

831
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:16,540
Ho, hey sweetheart.
Your mother was with me today.

832
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,140
Did you see her?

833
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,820
- No
- I told her I was afraid to leave you.

834
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,860
But... she promised.

835
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:34,780
- That she'd look after you.
- I'm sure she meant that.

836
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,460
Patricia, darling.

837
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,477
You've forgiven me, haven't you?

838
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,140
What do you need to be
forgiven for, daddy?

839
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:03,180
Those things...
You know, the things I did.

840
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,140
All you ever did was take care of me.

841
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,860
- Always look after me.
- Weren't you afraid of me?

842
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:16,460
No, daddy. No, sir.

843
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:21,220
You know how you get sometimes,
you get a little mixed up.

844
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:26,420
You feel responsible for
things you didn't do.

845
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:30,180
So I wasn't the one that hurt you?

846
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:34,495
No sir, that wasn't you.

847
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:37,260
I hope it wasn't true.

848
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:43,420
Patricia, darling,
I've always loved you.

849
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:52,060
Daddy, you can feel free to leave,
whenever you're ready.

850
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,420
Do you know that?
It's okay.

851
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,900
There is nothing to fear.

852
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,895
Come on.

853
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,300
Get out of here.

854
01:01:26,363 --> 01:01:28,540
Is Patricia be your mom?

855
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,660
What happened to her?

856
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,700
She left a while ago.

857
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,020
You mean she died?

858
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,980
How did she die?

859
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,420
My father left when I was a kid,
I don't really remember him,

860
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,335
It was always the three of us,
Mother, Grandpa and I together.

861
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,900
In his house.

862
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:07,020
I found her... on the floor.

863
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,677
She'd taken enough pills, so...

864
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:21,980
And, Grandpa at the moment,
kinda lost it...

865
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:28,780
I sat with grandpa on the porch and we
watched as they came, took her away...

866
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,540
How old were you?

867
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,220
Seven.

868
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,216
I don't know for sure
but I think that, when

869
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:46,740
my mother was young,
something happened

870
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,860
- With her and grandpa.
- Were you afraid of it?

871
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,500
No.

872
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,180
Did she ever say anything to you?

873
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,500
No.

874
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:10,860
But, looking back on it, I think she
protected me in her own way.

875
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,140
How?

876
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,157
She made me lock my door at night.

877
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,877
The park is now empty and bare,
with an abandoned shame about it.

878
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:55,060
The Jungle Jim. The slide and the swing
have rusted together.

879
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,597
And also terribly alone now.

880
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:01,037
Where did all the children go?

881
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,757
Didn't they know
that the park needed them?

882
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,660
The child's intelligent heart can find
the depth of many dark places.

883
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,780
But it can not fathom a delicate
moment of his own detachment.

884
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,740
- Hi Mr. Barthes.
- Hi Meredith.

885
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:36,420
- How's it going?
- Fine, I'm alright...

886
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,220
I made a picture for you.

887
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,980
Come here.

888
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,940
- You did?
- Yeah.

889
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:56,220
Wow, it's beautiful, it's...
you're really talented.

890
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,535
- Thanks
- Have you been doing this for a long time?

891
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,340
I've been doing it since I was a kid.

892
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:06,175
A faceless man in an empty room.

893
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,917
Is that how you see me, Meredith?

894
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,940
I don't know how I see you,

895
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,420
This is just how I thought
of you in your situation.

896
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,300
I mean, didn't you ever think about who
your teachers were on the outside?

897
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:22,180
- In real life?
- I guess so, yeah.

898
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,980
Does this place seem unreal to you?

899
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:30,020
I watched you around the school and
you always seem so sad.

900
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:39,077
If you've a hard time with things...
and you need someone to talk to...

901
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,780
- Meredith?
- Yes?

902
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:53,940
- Do you need someone to talk to?
- Yeah, will you talk to me?

903
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:00,140
When you talk to me, it's like
you really see me.

904
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,460
I do see you Meredith.

905
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:06,256
Want to go see Dr.
Parker with me?

906
01:06:06,381 --> 01:06:08,540
Oh, come on, don't blow me
off to the guidance counselor.

907
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,300
I'm not, I'm not...

908
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,660
What can I do?

909
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,496
It's like you said, we're...
we've *** into this.

910
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:20,020
There is nothing left, nothing but
to realize how fucked up things are.

911
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,780
It's not enough, I won't last.

912
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,460
Listen to me, just listen.

913
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:35,740
We are all the same, we all feel pain,
we all have chaos in our lives.

914
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,780
Life is very very confusing, I know.

915
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:48,820
I don't have the answers
but I know that if you write it out,

916
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:52,277
it will all be okay.

917
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:56,380
- Mr. Barthes, do you like me?
- Of course I do.

918
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,317
- Meredith...
- No, please...

919
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:10,575
- Meredit, I'd like to help you...
- Please, please...

920
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,637
- You don't...
- You said you liked me, please...

921
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,175
Please, please...

922
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,576
Oh please, don't push me
away, please Just hold on

923
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,100
to me and tell me that
everything is gonna be okay.

924
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,260
Everything is okay.
It is okay.

925
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,535
Meredith, wait a second

926
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:38,055
- What is going on?
- What?

927
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,980
- Hey, Meredith?
- What were you just doing?

928
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,940
Meredith, I am sorry.

929
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,340
- What were you doing?
- What?

930
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,540
What are you doing?

931
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,095
- Excuse me?!
- You were just touching her!

932
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,637
What are you...
what are you insinuating?

933
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,575
It is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl.

934
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,837
It's inappropriate?
She needed someone to talk to.

935
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,855
- What do you think I'm doing? Huh, lady?
- I don't know what you're doing.

936
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,815
Just hold me close.

937
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,375
What do you think I am fucking pervert?
Is that what you're insinuating?

938
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,300
She needed someone to talk to her.

939
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:08,420
- Well then why were you touching her?
- I wasn't touching her

940
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,100
***

941
01:08:12,483 --> 01:08:13,957
Patricia

942
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:17,100
I'm not... not some sick old man!

943
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,780
Is that what you think of me?

944
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,420
Is that what you think?

945
01:08:24,883 --> 01:08:26,477
I just wanted to help her!

946
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,375
- Get out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
- What am I supposed to think?

947
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,180
You're supposed to ***
fucking judgmental!

948
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:58,700
Hello? No, he's not home.

949
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,780
Hello Mr. Barthes.

950
01:09:25,243 --> 01:09:29,900
Whenever you feel like you're ready
we do have some paperwork downstairs,

951
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,180
that we need you to take care of.

952
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,020
I'm sorry.

953
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,660
I wish things were different.

954
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:32,180
I tried, you know, fuck
that thing is... we all...

955
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,260
We all have problems, we all have
things that we're dealing with, right?

956
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:45,096
Some days we're better than
others, some days we're

957
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:47,620
not so great, some days
we have limited space

958
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,020
for others.

959
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,317
***

960
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,620
Want some milk?

961
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:19,500
These kids need... something else.

962
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,980
They don't need me.

963
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,900
- You're okay?
- Yeah, I'm not hungry.

964
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,816
You know, you can't keep
living on the street.

965
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:46,340
I'm not, I mean I'm
staying here with you.

966
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,415
Well, you can't continue
to stay here with me.

967
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,740
- I'm not good for you.
- It's not true.

968
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,580
You're like the only
family I've ever had.

969
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,580
Well, I can't be your family.

970
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:09,420
I can't give you what you need.

971
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,780
- You have to understand, you should be...
- You are good...

972
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,420
and gentle...

973
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,060
you are the most kind...

974
01:12:32,923 --> 01:12:34,860
I love you Henry.

975
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:44,180
- Come on in.
- Hi.

976
01:12:46,123 --> 01:12:47,420
Hello there.

977
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:52,615
- Erica...
- Don't let them take me...

978
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,140
Please...

979
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,455
- Nooo...
- Listen, you have to...

980
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,300
You are all that I have, please...

981
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,980
Don't let me go...

982
01:13:04,723 --> 01:13:06,860
No, no...

983
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,157
Henry! Henry!

984
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:16,060
- Henry! Henry!
- You have to let go now.

985
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:24,020
- Henry! Henry!
- Come on.

986
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,380
- No! No!...
- It's gonna be okay.

987
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,495
Don't do this!

988
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:34,140
- It'll be okay.
- No! No! No!

989
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,100
No!...

990
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,197
Well, I feel just awful for her.

991
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,540
- For who?
- Our school.

992
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:34,700
It may sound baroque but I've always
felt that the school had a spirit.

993
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:40,060
These aren't just dull ***,
but they're alive.

994
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,820
I just don't understand it:
Where are all the parents?

995
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,300
I don't know.

996
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:03,460
I was in my room for two hours and saw one
parent, where are they? Where is everybody?

997
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,020
- We don't know.
- It's uncanny.

998
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:10,220
No air raid sirens, no bombs.

999
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,420
Doesn't happen that way.

1000
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,860
Starts in whisper, and then nothing.

1001
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,620
We had our music once, didn't we?

1002
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,740
Yes, we did.

1003
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,620
Do you remember these nights, when
we had two parents at a time?

1004
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,455
And then there were more, there were
many more waiting in the waiting ***

1005
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:34,700
The halls were full of joy and
celebration. Now, it's nothing.

1006
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,060
In remembrance of things passed.

1007
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,660
I actually felt quite at home.

1008
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,660
There were no parents.

1009
01:15:43,963 --> 01:15:48,780
I thought "how appropriate".
It was like, a moment of insight.

1010
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,700
The reality of the fucking problem
in the first place.

1011
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:03,020
Some of us believe that
we can make the difference.

1012
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,540
And then sometimes, we wake up

1013
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,060
and we realize we failed.

1014
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,077
Hi, this is Gretchen calling
from the free clinic.

1015
01:16:26,243 --> 01:16:28,535
Erica Louis' test results are back,

1016
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,175
please get us a call at
your earliest convenience.

1017
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,301
Thank you.

1018
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,095
- You have good parents.
- You shut up.

1019
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,317
- Meredith.
- Her mother and I gave her...

1020
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,860
You dike bitch!

1021
01:17:06,563 --> 01:17:08,808
What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?

1022
01:17:08,933 --> 01:17:11,300
... nothing but to
realize how fucked up...

1023
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:15,935
- Sorry you're picking a fight.
- Paint something cheerful...

1024
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:20,335
- We all have chaos in our lives...
- Grow your hair, lose some weight...

1025
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,220
It will all be okay.

1026
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,975
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1027
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,900
Alright, before we take roll,

1028
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:32,980
I want to tell you that...
today will be my last day with you.

1029
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,975
You're gonna have a permanent
teacher on Monday.

1030
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,820
- Where're you going, Mr. Barthes?
- I'll go to another school.

1031
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,117
- We'll miss you, man. *** with you.
- Yeah?

1032
01:17:44,283 --> 01:17:47,020
All those teachers in
this place... they're dickheads.

1033
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,495
You don't get tired of
moving around all the time?

1034
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:55,420
It's how my job works, Tania.
I come in here for a period of time...

1035
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,376
so you don't have 20 subs in
and out of here and then...

1036
01:17:58,501 --> 01:18:00,900
you have a permanent
teacher come in and...

1037
01:18:02,323 --> 01:18:04,300
and I leave.

1038
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:08,736
"Attention to all teachers,
this is a special

1039
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:11,260
announcement from the
principal's office."

1040
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:15,557
"There will be an all-faculty
meeting today, during nutrition."

1041
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,695
"Student nutrition will be extended"

1042
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:21,260
"for ten minutes, thank you."

1043
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:09,340
I invited you here, today,
to discuss the state of things.

1044
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:14,460
I know that there wasn't...
I know that there isn't...

1045
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:25,580
- I'm sorry...
- We all need something

1046
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:30,660
to distract us from...
complexity, and reality.

1047
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,997
No one wants to think about
where that came from?

1048
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:40,900
No one wants to think about
the struggle that it takes...

1049
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,100
To become somebody, to get out of...

1050
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,820
to get out of the...

1051
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:55,220
sea of pain that we all
have to get out off.

1052
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,380
- Hi Meredith
- Hey.

1053
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,140
Haven't seen you in class lately.

1054
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,340
Where have you been?

1055
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,060
- Baking.
- Oh, I see.

1056
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:15,877
Yeah.

1057
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:18,717
I'm happy I get to see you, you know.
It's my last day.

1058
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,500
How ironic!

1059
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:27,060
Listen, I was thinking,
I bought this for myself but...

1060
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:32,060
maybe you could...
make better use of it.

1061
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:47,140
- I like that the best.
- Can't have that one, it's mine.

1062
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,740
You can have this one?

1063
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:55,437
- It's better for you anyway.
- Thanks.

1064
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,020
I'm sorry.

1065
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:03,477
If I hurt you, in any way. I um...

1066
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:10,060
I know... that it's tough
right now, for you...

1067
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,420
- But it's not...
- Goodbye, Mr. Barthes.

1068
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,557
Goodbye Meredith.

1069
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:08,020
They say that suicide is a permanent
solution to a temporary problem,

1070
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,220
I'll let you know.

1071
01:22:13,403 --> 01:22:17,020
My name is Meredith and
I want to kill myself.

1072
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,020
Meredith.

1073
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,140
Henry

1074
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:00,500
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1075
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:06,700
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1076
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:15,020
We have such a responsibility to guide
a young so that they don't end up...

1077
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:21,380
falling apart,

1078
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:25,100
falling by the wayside,

1079
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,900
becoming insignificant.

1080
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,860
I realized something today.

1081
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:56,140
I'm a non-person, Sarah.

1082
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,740
You shouldn't be here.

1083
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:06,420
I'm not here.

1084
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:13,860
You may see me...
but I'm hollow.

1085
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:54,180
Failing...
we're failing.

1086
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:02,020
Failed in the sense that we...
have left... everyone down.

1087
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,237
Including ourselves.

1088
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:16,220
Walking on the hallway, or in class,

1089
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:21,740
how many of you... have ever felt
the weight pressing down on you?

1090
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:29,580
I have.

1091
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:38,620
Everyone? Well, Poe wrote about
these things over 100 years ago.

1092
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:45,340
So, as we read...

1093
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:50,740
we can see that the House of Usher
is not merely an old...

1094
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,580
decrepit castle in disrepair.

1095
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,580
It's also a state of being.

1096
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:10,375
<i>During the whole of a dull,
dark, and soundless day</i>

1097
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:15,300
<i>in the autumn of that year, when the clouds
hung oppressively low in the heavens,</i>

1098
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:20,477
<i>I had been passing alone,
on horseback,</i>

1099
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:23,780
<i>through a singularly
dreary tract of country;</i>

1100
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:28,780
<i>And at length found myself, as the
shades of the evening drew on,</i>

1101
01:28:29,363 --> 01:28:32,140
<i>within view of the
melancholy House of Usher.</i>

1102
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,780
<i>I know not how it was</i>

1103
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:38,616
<i>but, with the first glimpse
of the building, a</i>

1104
01:28:38,741 --> 01:28:41,140
<i>sense of insufferable
gloom pervaded my spirit.</i>

1105
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,820
<i>I looked upon the simple
landscape of the domain,</i>

1106
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:51,900
upon the bleak walls, upon the
white trunks of decayed trees

1107
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:55,740
<i>with an utter depression of soul.</i>

1108
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,100
<i>There was an iciness,</i>

1109
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,300
<i>a sinking,</i>

1110
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:07,260
<i>a sickening of the heart.</i>
