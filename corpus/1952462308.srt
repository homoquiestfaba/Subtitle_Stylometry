1
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:11,954
<i>Hi, this is Robert. I can't talk right now.</i>

2
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:15,785
<i>Leave a message and I'll get back to you.</i>

3
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:19,042
Hi, Robert, it's Alison. Call me.
If you get this, will you call me,

4
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:21,034
when you get this, will you call me, please?

5
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:24,618
I'm trying to find a J Bridge. Jude.
Short for Judith, I presume.

6
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:26,928
But I don't know. I can't find her
in the book anywhere.

7
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:30,233
I'm sorry, I'm not being very clear.
Erm, I'm trying to find...

8
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:35,291
Erm, he works at Cabot University in the, erm...
psychology department.

9
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:39,870
Er, no, actually. I'm trying to find out if there's
been an accident anywhere tonight

10
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,419
in Bristol anywhere...
Well, it's a bit obscure...

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,550
I do know what time it is!
Yes, of course I know what time it is!

12
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:13,076
Robert!

13
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:18,699
Hello? Can I help you?

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,850
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

15
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:24,314
Tutte le volte che sto facendo qualcosa
d'importante c'e qualcuno che rompe...

16
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:27,460
- Chiudi quella porta, ho freddo.
- Allora... Non fare il bambino.

17
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:29,850
I want Robert. This is Robert's boat.

18
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,441
Sorry, this is our boat now.

19
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:16,086
Can you tell me if you've got a patient here
by the name of Robert Bridge, please?

20
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,356
- When did he come in? Do you know?
- I don't know.

21
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:21,024
- Do you know what ward he's in?
- I don't know anything.

22
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:22,378
- Robert Bridge.
- Yep.

23
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,878
- B-R-I...
- D-G-E!

24
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,458
Barbara?

25
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,959
Barbara? Barbara!

26
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,219
- He's dead, isn't he?
- What are you doing here?

27
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,166
- I saw him. He appeared to me. I knew...
- Oh, please!

28
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:46,432
Well, for your information, you're wrong.
He's not dead.

29
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,503
Oh, thank God. Thank Christ.

30
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:50,733
So... And what's happened?
I don't understand!

31
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:54,544
Oh! Your powers seem to have deserted you.

32
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:58,698
- He collapsed while he was driving home.
- Oh, OK. OK.

33
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:02,760
So his heart must have stopped beating.
Is that what they said? Did they say that?

34
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,472
Go away!

35
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:06,973
I... can't!

36
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,494
Oh, God. He didn't tell you.

37
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,779
Erm...

38
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:18,411
He found out he had a tumour in the brain.

39
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:21,397
The doctor said it was inoperable. Terminal.

40
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:23,588
- Where is he?
- They gave him months, weeks.

41
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:25,659
- He was coming to terms with it.
- Where is he?

42
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,769
- Now they don't know...
- Where is he?

43
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,270
He's in intensive care.

44
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,510
Excuse me. Can you tell me
the way to intensive care, pl...?

45
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:57,884
Excuse me! Excuse me!

46
00:04:57,892 --> 00:05:00,122
Excuse me...

47
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:02,623
Can I help you?

48
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:06,446
Can I help you?

49
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,951
I'm starving!

50
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:56,220
Excuse me. I've come to see Robert Bridge.
He's your patient.

51
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,410
Could you let me know
when his visitor's gone?

52
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:01,676
- I'm sitting over there.
- He's allowed two visitors at a time.

53
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,177
No, it's OK. I'll wait.

54
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:17,088
We're helping him to breathe at the moment
because he can't do that himself.

55
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,676
Can you tell how bad things are?

56
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:23,061
You'll have to talk to Dr Pran about that.

57
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:26,566
There's been no change since he got here.

58
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,149
Sometimes no change is good.

59
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,643
Why didn't you tell me?

60
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,159
What did you think I'd say?

61
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:05,856
Why didn't you let me help you?

62
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:10,325
What were you afraid of?

63
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:16,862
Don't you know that you could have talked?

64
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,405
Just talked.

65
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:22,113
Just...

66
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,099
talked.

67
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,768
And I'd have listened.

68
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:26,078
It's getting late, love. Maybe you should
go home and get some rest.

69
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,579
Just a while longer.

70
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,243
I'm Zoe.

71
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,169
- I'm Alison.
- Are you a relative?

72
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,734
No.

73
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,132
I'm his friend.

74
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,870
- He's a fighter.
- Yeah, I know he is.

75
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,499
Have you known him long?

76
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:52,521
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:56,382
Hey, listen. You stay as long as you like.

78
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,789
Wh... What's that woman doing here?

79
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:29,651
I don't want her here. Get her out of here.

80
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:31,823
Jude...

81
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,371
Don't talk to me. Don't be here.

82
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:37,199
No, wait a minute. It's all right.
Let me talk to you.

83
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,584
You see, he's not ready to die. He told me.

84
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:41,699
What?

85
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,128
He, er... He came to me.

86
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:49,266
W- When it happened, I saw him. When
his heart stopped beating he came to me.

87
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,978
He came to you?

88
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,479
He came to YOU?

89
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:56,591
You bitch! You bitch!

90
00:11:56,634 --> 00:12:00,814
You bitch! Get out! Get out!

91
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:03,164
Get out!

92
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:07,147
- Get out!
- It's OK, she's gone, she's gone. Shh.

93
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:09,297
- Get out!
- It's OK. She's gone, she's gone.

94
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:12,402
She's gone now. She's gone.

95
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:02,423
I always talk to them.

96
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,206
Sometimes you'll see the flick of an eyelid.

97
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:08,827
Any sort of response, really.

98
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,600
Sometimes they can't move or even breathe,
but they can hear.

99
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,980
Robert?

100
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:30,117
Robert...

101
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,948
I don't know what to say.

102
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:36,939
It doesn't matter. Just anything.

103
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:40,426
Just so long as he hears your voice.

104
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:13,655
"Once upon a time, in the heart of
a deep, dark forest, there stood a castle.

105
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:17,198
"And in the castle lived a king and queen.

106
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,706
"One day, the queen was walking in the forest

107
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:23,848
"and she found a pretty bird
trapped in a thorn bush.

108
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:26,432
"She released it.

109
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:29,941
"Soon afterwards, the queen gave birth
to a lovely daughter.

110
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:33,884
"And all the fairies of the land
were invited to the celebrations.

111
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,632
"One gave her the gift of beauty.

112
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:39,928
"One the gift of a singing voice.

113
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,808
"And one the gift of dancing. "

114
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:49,734
Now, I should tell you, it's rare for a coma
to last more than two to four weeks.

115
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,407
Thank God.

116
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,908
However...

117
00:14:55,948 --> 00:15:01,124
the other possibility is that he might not
come out of a coma at all...

118
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:06,141
and instead slip into what we call
a persistent vegetative state.

119
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:08,642
Oh, God.

120
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:13,867
I'm telling you these possibilities,
Mrs Bridge, because...

121
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:18,527
as next of kin, there may be
difficult decisions ahead.

122
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:20,438
Decisions?

123
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,939
What decisions?

124
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:30,036
His mother's in a nursing home, his father's
dead, and there's no other close family.

125
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:33,859
Well, if there's anyone else
who needs to see him,

126
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,364
- now would be a good time to ask them.
- What? What are you saying?

127
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:39,873
He's not going to die.
He's not ready to die. He's not.

128
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:41,585
- He's not! He's not!
- Excuse me.

129
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:44,134
- Sorry, do you know who this is?
- He needs someone with him.

130
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:47,280
Robert! I want to see him.
You can't stop me seeing him!

131
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,709
I want to go to him and be next to him.

132
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,979
He knows me, he needs me.
He doesn't know you.

133
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,046
You don't care about him. You don't
understand me. He doesn't know you.

134
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:59,727
- Robert!
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

135
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,578
Come on.

136
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:31,010
I listen to them and it's like nails going in.

137
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,922
And I'm not even listening.

138
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:35,311
And I know I should. I have to.

139
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:38,537
And then I hear her
and she's saying, "His spirit"...

140
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:41,038
"His spirit says" and...

141
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,639
There's this feeling in my heart.

142
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,068
Of course. You wouldn't be human
if there wasn't.

143
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:47,458
No, I mean real feeling.

144
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,086
Jude, people like Alison feed on...

145
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:54,785
People like Alison... Not people like Alison.
Alison saw him.

146
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:58,286
- She says she saw him.
- I know.

147
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:01,834
I know. I'm not looking for a rational argument,
Barb, I'm just...

148
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:06,414
- I just want support.
- What Alison offers isn't support, it's madness.

149
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:10,675
What's more, it's a madness Robert spent
his entire academic life exposing.

150
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,144
- Exposing or exploring?
- What's the difference?

151
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:14,259
Everything.

152
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,525
It's the very thing he despised,
the exploitation of the vulnerable.

153
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,915
- Thank you.
- Oh, come on!

154
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,379
You know what I'm saying.
You're an intelligent woman.

155
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,043
At times like this,
especially at times like this,

156
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:29,233
the urge to believe must be overwhelming.

157
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:32,260
But you've got to listen to the doctors,
for God's sake.

158
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,689
For Robert's sake.

159
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,760
You know I'm right.

160
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:39,667
Look, I-I don't care what you believe
or don't believe.

161
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:42,774
What I care about is Robert's welfare
and whether he's suffering.

162
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,402
- Oh, and I don't?
- Of course you do.

163
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:48,269
And that's why it's hard. It's harder for you.

164
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,818
But you've got to find the courage
not to be selfish,

165
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,203
not to give over to miracles
and life after death

166
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:57,986
and the idea that Robert's going to
spring back to life because she says so.

167
00:17:57,987 --> 00:18:02,606
Because it'll hurt you,
and I don't want to see you hurt.

168
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:05,394
I don't think he did despise her.

169
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:08,325
I don't think he ever did that.

170
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,509
It's Alison Mundy to see Robert Bridge, please.

171
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,070
<i>I'll just come and get you.</i>

172
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:35,620
- Has his wife been back in?
- Yeah.

173
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:38,121
- Is she there now?
- No.

174
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:44,690
- Can I come in, please?
- Dr Pran said not to admit you in the future.

175
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:50,816
- Dr. Pran isn't working tonight. - Thank you.

176
00:18:57,587 --> 00:19:00,087
Are you all right?

177
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:08,059
Alison, maybe I've got this wrong, but I...

178
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,520
I thought I heard you say
that you saw Robert's spirit.

179
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:15,021
I did.

180
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:18,286
He's still alive.

181
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:20,997
What does that mean?

182
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:23,543
I don't know.

183
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,299
What's it like? Do...

184
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,405
Do they come to you? What do you do?

185
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:32,096
I try to help them if I can.

186
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:36,043
And sometimes I can, sometimes I can't.

187
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,716
And...

188
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:41,705
Now I... I want to help him.

189
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:45,128
But I don't know how.

190
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,420
Zoe.

191
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:54,455
I saw... a nurse...

192
00:19:56,168 --> 00:20:02,977
wearing an old-fashioned uniform standing by
that old lady just before she died.

193
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:04,928
You saw her?

194
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:07,429
Who is she?

195
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:10,982
Well, you hear lots of different stories
over the years.

196
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:13,483
Who is she?

197
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:19,724
They say she's a night nurse
who lost her lover.

198
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:22,494
He was in this awful accident.

199
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:26,314
She was on duty when he was
brought in with these burns.

200
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:29,181
She tried to save him but couldn't.

201
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:32,062
And she died of a broken heart.

202
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,071
He died in agony.

203
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:43,322
And now it's her mission to take people away
peacefully when their time is due.

204
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,577
So I was told.

205
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:50,758
What was her name?

206
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:53,506
Nobody knows.

207
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:58,607
Like I say, maybe it's only a story.

208
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:37,289
<i>Hi, this is Robert. If you want to leave a
message for me or Jude, do so after the beep.</i>

209
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:45,732
<i>Hi, this is Robert. If you want to leave a
message for me or Jude, do so after the beep.</i>

210
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,658
Sweeping you up in my arms...

211
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:47,729
Type... number...

212
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:50,989
Mm...

213
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:54,378
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

214
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,923
Certainly.

215
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,637
Have they been good to you?

216
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:05,206
They've been great.

217
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:11,063
That's what I'm doing...

218
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:14,366
in here.

219
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,868
Sweeping you up in my arms.

220
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,772
Me too.

221
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,684
Hey...

222
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:28,185
Hey, fine, fine.

223
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:33,601
It's strange.

224
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:42,362
The gift of beauty.

225
00:23:45,796 --> 00:23:48,296
The gift of dancing.

226
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,000
The gift...

227
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,580
What was the other gift?

228
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:06,228
Jude, he probably needs some rest now.

229
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:08,657
Maybe you should take a break as well, yeah?

230
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:11,358
Whenever you're ready, though.

231
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,910
<i>When will he be able to come home?</i>

232
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:26,976
Let's take this one step at a time, shall we?

233
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:31,197
The progress of the tumour
may make that... unachievable.

234
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:33,308
No. You hear stories all the time.

235
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,852
People are told they have six months to live,
the cancer goes into remission.

236
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:40,437
Those cases are rare.
Very rare indeed.

237
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:45,438
But it happens.
They can't explain it, but it happens.

238
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:49,915
Robert's awake.

239
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:52,464
- He's talking.
- Oh...

240
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:55,849
- Erm, well, I'll just get...
- No, he needs rest.

241
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:01,089
I just came to get a few things,
someone to look after the baby.

242
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,940
I'm going back as soon as I...

243
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:07,658
Erm, do you want to come in?

244
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:14,701
Take a seat.

245
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:17,696
Would you, er...
Would you like a drink?

246
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:20,197
No, thanks.

247
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,356
He was on his way round here with that
when he collapsed.

248
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:34,027
Was it on the passenger seat?

249
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,083
Yes.

250
00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:44,896
The nurses said that they'd call but they're
probably busy, they've got better things to do,

251
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:49,557
much better things to do
like looking after Robert.

252
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:55,887
I didn't mean to hurt you but when he appeared
to me I knew he was still there,

253
00:25:55,888 --> 00:26:01,238
- he was still fighting, still clinging on and...
- He was.

254
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:04,402
The thing is, Alison...

255
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:06,640
why didn't he appear to me?

256
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:09,141
He would've if he could.

257
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:12,415
- But you're special.
- No.

258
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,916
Not special.

259
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:17,624
Different.

260
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,251
He said he wanted to help you.

261
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:24,641
Did he help you?

262
00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:28,552
He held my hand and took me to the past...

263
00:26:28,624 --> 00:26:31,344
and told me not to be afraid.

264
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:35,027
He saved my life.

265
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:38,356
He thought my life was worth saving.

266
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:44,675
He's the first person I think I've ever met
who did.

267
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:50,048
I should go.

268
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,593
Well, thank you very much for coming.
I do appreciate it.

269
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:55,425
You didn't have to.

270
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:57,926
Yes, I did.

271
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:03,601
Do you want to come with me?

272
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,563
I'm sorry, he...

273
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:13,147
He's been unconscious for the last two hours.

274
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:15,648
He's not responding.

275
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:18,356
I'm sorry.

276
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:37,641
I'm, er, gonna go and get a drink of water.
Do you want one?

277
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:40,892
Did he ever talk to you about Josh?

278
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,872
Yeah.

279
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:51,787
Please tell me the truth when I ask you this.

280
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,599
In the beginning...

281
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:56,796
did Robert come to you
to contact our son?

282
00:27:56,797 --> 00:27:59,185
No.

283
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:02,251
But from the very first time that I met Robert,

284
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:04,801
I saw Josh.

285
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:09,699
Josh needed his daddy...

286
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,155
to let him go...

287
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:16,561
so that he could be at peace.

288
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:20,876
And then... so could Robert be at peace.

289
00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:31,164
When we talked recently, I think...

290
00:28:31,165 --> 00:28:35,055
he was nearing an acceptance of the tumour.

291
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:40,648
Almost ready to accept the mystery...

292
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:46,568
He said to me recently...

293
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:53,110
"I don't know what it all means
but I love my life. "

294
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:57,872
Maybe that's all the meaning you need.

295
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:02,625
After all this time listening to...

296
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:06,626
Robert's scepticism about faith and religion.

297
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,730
I think he's the most spiritual person
I've ever known.

298
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,230
I just want my husband back.

299
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,850
Wait!

300
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:01,359
Wait!

301
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,220
Stop!

302
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:35,453
Don't take him!

303
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:38,439
It's not his time. Tell me that you won't.

304
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,908
You can't.

305
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:43,409
Wait.

306
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:50,016
You know what it's like to lose someone
that you love, don't you?

307
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:54,564
You know what I'm going through.

308
00:31:55,586 --> 00:32:00,324
I don't want to have to watch him die
like you did and I don't have to if you help me.

309
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:05,262
Please. I don't want to have to suffer
like you suffered.

310
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:09,603
You don't take them till they're ready, do you?
Well, he's not ready. He's not, he's not.

311
00:32:09,604 --> 00:32:11,634
He told me that he's not.

312
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:14,135
He's struggling.

313
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:25,565
Take somebody else.

314
00:32:27,923 --> 00:32:33,496
Take anybody else, only
please, please, don't take him.

315
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,038
Please don't take him.

316
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:42,538
What do I have to do?

317
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:47,118
What do I have to do?
All my life I've done things for you!

318
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,224
And now I ask this, this one thing.

319
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:54,155
Tell me what I have to do and I'll do it!

320
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,073
He's not ready to die, but I am.

321
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,999
Is that it?

322
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,560
You don't have to take him.

323
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:23,521
Take me. I'm not afraid of death.
I've been there. Twice.

324
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:30,924
Do you want me to help you? Do you want me
to help you pass over? I-Is that it?

325
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,756
I can do that, I know I can.

326
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:38,857
For you, I'll do it for you. We'll do it together.
We'll go now.

327
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:48,092
Tell me that you'll let him be and I'll do it.
Tell me that you'll let him live and I'll do it.

328
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:58,836
Take me instead.

329
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:27,386
Are you OK?

330
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:33,922
Sometimes... I think the spirits are good...

331
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,793
and just.

332
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:39,700
And sometimes I think they're evil...

333
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:42,201
and selfish.

334
00:35:43,723 --> 00:35:49,143
I'd like to think that they can be
more than human beings.

335
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,320
But they're not.

336
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:55,821
They can do good.

337
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,967
They can help.

338
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:02,392
But they don't.

339
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:07,778
Maybe there are some things
that they can't interfere with.

340
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,279
Or stop.

341
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:12,788
They just have to happen.

342
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:19,168
He has so much more to live for than I do.

343
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:21,669
Oh, that's not true.

344
00:36:21,798 --> 00:36:26,188
How can you measure
the value of a life anyway?

345
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,299
I know this is Robert's slot.

346
00:36:43,342 --> 00:36:45,902
I'm going to take it today.

347
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:49,617
You all know why he's not here.

348
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:57,518
I just thought it might be appropriate to read
these notes that were typed up on his desk.

349
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:01,540
I don't know if he was going
to share them with you.

350
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:07,593
They're from a chapter from his unfinished book
on the psychology of mediumship.

351
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:10,094
I'll read them.

352
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:16,315
"To quote University of Chicago sociologist
of religion Andrew Greeley,

353
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:20,812
"'Humankind is born with two incurable diseases.

354
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:25,228
<i>"'Life, from which it inevitably dies,</i>

355
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:30,516
<i>"'and hope, which hints
that death may not be the end. "'</i>

356
00:37:30,812 --> 00:37:33,312
<i>"Unquote.</i>

357
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:36,783
<i>"I have spent my life hoping,</i>

358
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:43,075
<i>"hoping, I now realise,
to find undeniable proof of life after death.</i>

359
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:48,208
<i>"But the truth is, as it must be...</i>

360
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:51,958
<i>the only proof we will ever grasp</i>

361
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,944
<i>is in the moment when it happens.</i>

362
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:57,445
"The moment we die.

363
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:03,267
"Then I have no doubt all will become clear. "

364
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,819
Robert?

365
00:38:20,536 --> 00:38:22,645
Listen to me. I...

366
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:27,116
I want a few more arguments
with you, all right?

367
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:31,962
Cos, erm... it... it's good for the soul.

368
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,943
My soul.

369
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:38,846
I need it.

370
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:19,865
It's time, isn't it?

371
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,675
It is. You know it is.

372
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,625
Help me.

373
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:33,126
I can't.

374
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:41,994
I thought it would be so clear but it isn't.

375
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,104
I thought all the questions would be answered

376
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:51,605
but they're not.

377
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:54,520
It's so hard.

378
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:59,591
- It's so hard to let go.
- I don't want to lose you.

379
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,347
What I'm leaving behind

380
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:08,848
is so precious to me.

381
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:13,238
You know that, don't you?

382
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,228
Yes.

383
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,729
I do.

384
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:27,454
I'm afraid.

385
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:29,804
Don't be afraid.

386
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,305
I'm right here.

387
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,889
I'm right by your side.

388
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:40,594
There's nothing to be afraid of any more.

389
00:40:41,513 --> 00:40:46,673
You just leave that behind
and take all the good things.

390
00:40:50,832 --> 00:40:53,332
My body.

391
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:56,279
My life.

392
00:40:56,527 --> 00:40:59,027
Your body let you down.

393
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,440
But your body isn't you.

394
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:06,766
What am I, then?

395
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,267
Free.

396
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,547
No!
