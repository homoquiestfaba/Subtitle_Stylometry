1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,033
(funky music)

2
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,366
- It's time.

3
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:23,033
Pay the man, Ruben.

4
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,300
(funky music)

5
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:23,933
What the hell's goin' on?

6
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,400
- Lenny, can't 
you read the sign?

7
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,700
- What sign?

8
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,133
He's goin' out of business.

9
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:34,200
That's the way it is.

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,233
They bought him out.

11
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:37,066
Can't even buy a paper.

12
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,033
Whatever happened 
to the newspaper?

13
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:38,833
- Bought him out?

14
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,133
Who bought him out?

15
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,600
- Take your pick, 
it doesn't matter.

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,066
That's what I'm talking about.

17
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,833
Survival of the fittest.

18
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,500
It's tough, it's 
tough out there.

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,900
They eat you for a snack.

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,866
They want you, they eat you.

21
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,433
That's how it is.

22
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,400
I'll tell you why.

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,700
'Cause nobody cares for nobody.

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,066
It ain't exactly 
front page, but,

25
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:59,000
it's getting crueler.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,233
Can you feel it?

27
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,633
- We almost there?

28
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:02,933
- [Lenny] It's comin'.

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,133
(horn honks)

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,900
(yelling in foreign language)

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,533
- [Ruben] What the 
hell are you doing?

32
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,400
- He wants to run me over?

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll make it easy.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,866
(car horns honking)

35
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,633
What the hell's the 
matter with you?

36
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,000
Who do you think you are anyway?

37
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,600
Take a shot, you 
bloodthirsty animal.

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,400
- Let's go.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,200
Come on, come on.

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,666
Let's go, let's go.

41
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,800
Shut up, get out of the way.

42
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,666
- You saved my life.

43
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,100
I'd like to save your life.

44
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,800
If law school doesn't pan out,

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,933
I'll be a doctor.

46
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,166
- I'll dock ya.

47
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,733
- First, I'm gonna sue that one,

48
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,766
and then I'm gonna 
save your life.

49
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,266
Come on, I want a coffee.

50
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:51,900
Black coffee.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
You gotta start somewhere.

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,133
You help others, 
you help yourself.

53
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,566
And that's the truest truth.

54
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,333
- That juice didn't 
help my stomach,

55
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,966
and neither did your platitudes.

56
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,233
- What do you know?

57
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,300
I'll tell you what I know.

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,066
This is good coffee.

59
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,233
I love coffee.

60
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,166
Coffee tastes good.

61
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,166
I realized that a long time ago,

62
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,966
and I'm realizing it again.

63
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,733
Only now it's better.

64
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:22,833
And there's no denyin' it.

65
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,666
- It's wonderful, Lenny.

66
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,800
- Lenny, did you see what 
Glow Tech did yesterday?

67
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,466
- Glow Tech?

68
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,666
Who?

69
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,800
- Glow Tech jumped 
ten points and split.

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,233
I hope you did my advice.

71
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,666
- Sure, I always take 
your advice, Joey.

72
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,233
- Here's another one.

73
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,700
Anta-mix.

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,133
Yeah, it's a good buy.

75
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,600
I know of what I speak.

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,466
- Sure, Joey.

77
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,200
How are you doin'?

78
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,800
- Angst is how I am.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,900
That is the trouble with me.

80
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,033
I got angst.

81
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,466
You know.

82
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:52,333
Listen Lenny, I 
hate to trouble ya.

83
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,066
- Oh sure, Joey.

84
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,133
Yeah.

85
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,400
We're runnin' late.

86
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,633
Give 'im a couple of 
bucks, all right Ruby?

87
00:03:57,866 --> 00:03:59,400
Okay, and...

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,300
- [Ruby] All I got's twenties.

89
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,833
- [Lenny] Do you have 
change for a 20, miss?

90
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,900
- [Woman] Sorry.

91
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,400
- [Lenny] Sir.

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,733
Excuse me, do you...

93
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:13,966
Uh, gentleman,

94
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,100
so would you mind change...

95
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:23,633
Here you go, kid.

96
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,733
Here you go.

97
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,133
- What's this?

98
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,266
- Come on, don't 
you love New York?

99
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,733
- [Ruben] You shouldn't 
have done that.

100
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,800
- Good for your karma.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
- It isn't karma.

102
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,700
- Now you'll come 
back as a Rockefeller.

103
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,933
- That has nothing 
to do with karma.

104
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:41,933
The difference is...

105
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,066
- Oh don't start 
explaining to me

106
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:45,666
about transmigration of souls.

107
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,066
Or reincarnation, 
so help me Ruben.

108
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,733
- I'm not a bank machine.

109
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:50,833
- If you're worried about lunch,

110
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:51,866
stop it right now.

111
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,933
Lunch is not a problem.

112
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,533
Come on, we're late.

113
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,066
This is what I'm talking about.

114
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,066
Look at this.

115
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,300
You wanna give me an investment?

116
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,333
Give me a public company 
that does scaffolding.

117
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,733
That's an investment.

118
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,000
Goddamn scaffolding's 
taking over the city.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
- I don't think scaffolding's 
publicly traded.

120
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,433
- You know something?

121
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,833
I'm serious about coffee.

122
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,366
Coffee, I'm better with it.

123
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,433
Without coffee I've got 
nothing going for me.

124
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,133
- [Ruben] Yeah, but your heart.

125
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,466
- What about my heart?

126
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:26,033
I've been asleep for six 
months with herbal tea.

127
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,233
What's the point?

128
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,233
Coffee makes all the 
difference in the world.

129
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:32,066
Let me tell you something.

130
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,200
Before I gave up coffee,

131
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,133
there was a lot.

132
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,166
There was a lot.

133
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,466
Believe me.

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,700
There was a lot, believe me.

135
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,266
Oh damn.

136
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,200
Son of a bitch.

137
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,433
This is what I'm talking about.

138
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
What are you waiting for?

139
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,166
Don't you wanna meet her?

140
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,466
Keep walking.

141
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,433
- [Ruben] What do you 
mean keep walking?

142
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:57,766
- Keep walking, don't look.

143
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,633
I said don't look.

144
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:07,566
What is that?

145
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:08,866
- You looked.

146
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:09,866
- Yeah, I looked.

147
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,400
I looked, but the both of us

148
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,500
standing there like 
a couple of idiots.

149
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,633
You ruined it.

150
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:15,866
- Did you see her?

151
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,300
- [Lenny] No, I 
couldn't see anything.

152
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Did you see her?

153
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,833
- How do I know if I saw her?

154
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,966
- Did you see the most 
beautiful creature

155
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:22,266
on God's green earth?

156
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,333
[Lenny] No.

157
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,366
- Then you didn't see her.

158
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:26,866
- Now what?

159
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:27,966
- Her appointment is at ten.

160
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,300
It's 10:15, she's in there.

161
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,800
- [Ruben] 10:20.

162
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,533
- Your watch is fast.

163
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,800
- Yours is slow.

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
- You're always fast, 
and you always forget.

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,833
You're too young to forget.

166
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,233
Why don't you remember?

167
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,766
- Ten o'clock you say?

168
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,266
- For three weeks 
since I spied her,

169
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:45,033
she's been here at 
ten on Tuesday's,

170
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,066
and then she hops 
the bus to Sachs.

171
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,766
- And meanwhile?

172
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,400
- [Lenny] We wait.

173
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,233
- We're poking out 
like a sore thumb.

174
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,066
How about there?

175
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,633
- I don't frequent those places.

176
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,200
- [Ruben] What places?

177
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,533
- There's no table service.

178
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,533
- Table service, 
that's a good one.

179
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,700
He wants table service

180
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,500
to discuss his 
latest infatuation.

181
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:11,033
- Infatuation?

182
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,933
Infatuation sounds lascivious.

183
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,000
That's not me.

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,933
I'm respectful, I'm cordial.

185
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:17,900
Dignified.

186
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,633
Wouldn't you say?

187
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,966
Ruben?

188
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:24,833
- I'd say terrifying.

189
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,133
- Not what I'm looking for.

190
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:29,000
- Is that her?

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,133
- No.

192
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,166
Her I would not be terrified.

193
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,733
Besides, she's not my type.

194
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,900
This one, the one we're 
waiting for is special.

195
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,333
She reminds me of Ester.

196
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,700
- [Ruben] Lenny.

197
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:47,000
- What time is it?

198
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,433
- 11:15.

199
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:51,033
11:10 according to your watch.

200
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,333
- It's 11:12.

201
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,100
- [Waitress] There you go.

202
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,400
- You're not from here.

203
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
- No.

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,266
- Upstate then?

205
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,233
Where you from?

206
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,033
- [Waitress] Washington state.

207
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:08,300
- That's, that's 
a beautiful place.

208
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,400
I've never been there.

209
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,166
- He never been anywhere.

210
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,066
(laughing)

211
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:15,900
- Italy, and Jersey, 
when I was ten,

212
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,600
but I remember everything.

213
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,900
That's a beautiful place.

214
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,666
- Well, this is a 
beautiful place too.

215
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,266
- You make it more beautiful.

216
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,900
- Oh, thank you.

217
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,466
- And you say you can't 
talk to a pretty girl.

218
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,066
What do you call that?

219
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,633
- That one, she's a kiss.

220
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:35,333
I always liked the waitress.

221
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,000
That's why I like 
the table service.

222
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,133
No table service, no waitress.

223
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,400
That's what I'm talking about.

224
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,633
They approach you, they smile,

225
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:44,300
they talk to you, 
they bring you food.

226
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,033
I always like the waitress.

227
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,666
- Hey, my wife's 
getting a raise.

228
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,933
Big one.

229
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,100
Big position change 
for her over there.

230
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,166
- Good.

231
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,033
Good for you.

232
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,066
Good for your wife.

233
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,000
Let me ask you something.

234
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,233
Why do you call her your wife?

235
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:01,666
Her name is Marcy.

236
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,233
The way you say, my wife,

237
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,066
it's as though you're 
discovering for 
the first time...

238
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,300
- She is my wife.

239
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,733
- A man who has been 
married 25 years

240
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,066
talking to his lifelong friend

241
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:11,233
shouldn't call 
his wife his wife.

242
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,400
He should call her 
by her first name,

243
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,433
which in this case is Marcy.

244
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,366
Now, if you were divorced,

245
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,266
had a wife and an ex-wife,

246
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,666
then I could understand 
the differentiation

247
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,300
between the wife 
and the ex-wife,

248
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,800
but even then I think 
it would be more natural

249
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,000
for you to call them 
by their first names.

250
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,000
What kind of money 
are we talking about?

251
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,666
- I don't know.

252
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,300
She thinks maybe 
close as twice as much

253
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,100
as what she's making now.

254
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,233
- Very interesting 
woman, your wife.

255
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,533
- Now what does that mean?

256
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,966
- It means you should leave her.

257
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,833
- Is that her?

258
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,766
- Of course not.

259
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,833
- You got something 
on your face.

260
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,633
- What?

261
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,300
- I don't know what.

262
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,433
Here, let me.

263
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,200
- [Lenny] What is it?

264
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,500
- I don't know.

265
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,766
Cake?

266
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:05,666
- I was not eating cake.

267
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,866
- It looks like cake.

268
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:10,233
- My face is turning to cake.

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,333
I can't do this, my 
face is falling off.

270
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,400
- Oh, you look fine.

271
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,233
- Who do I think I am?

272
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,833
- You're Lenny, a fine 
looking gentleman.

273
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,400
You know, handsome.

274
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,200
- Fine?

275
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,033
What is this fine?

276
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,133
I can't do this.

277
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:25,933
I, I...

278
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:26,866
- [Ruben] Sure you can.

279
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,133
- No, no, you're not the one

280
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,666
who's face is falling off.

281
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,900
- You look good.

282
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,700
You're a handsome, 
a handsome man.

283
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,233
- [Lenny] Oh, shut up.

284
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,466
- Lenny.

285
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,466
- And do me a favor 
and do something.

286
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,466
Anything please.

287
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,366
- [Ruben] Like what?

288
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,266
- That's it.

289
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,533
Forget about it.

290
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,233
Forget about the 
whole damn thing.

291
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:41,933
I'm leaving.

292
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:42,766
I'm going.

293
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:43,466
- [Ruben] No, no.

294
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:44,733
I'm sorry.

295
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:45,933
- [Lenny] What are 
you sorry about?

296
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:46,633
This is, this is a 
rotten idea, all right.

297
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:47,733
Let me go!

298
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,933
(dramatic music)

299
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,000
- The problem with this city

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,533
is it doesn't have any 
respect for itself.

301
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,133
Little creature comforts.

302
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,066
Name a creature comfort.

303
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:17,733
There, you see.

304
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,233
You can't.

305
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,866
It's a hard city.

306
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:22,633
Streets are hard, 
buildings are hard.

307
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,066
What's not hard about it?

308
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,900
Tell me.

309
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,133
It's the land of the rich 
now, starting to get out.

310
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,233
- Everyone's already gone.

311
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,200
- Yeah, if they're right,

312
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
they're right to get out.

313
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,433
- I'll never leave.

314
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,000
- Yeah, when you're 
younger, you know,

315
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,066
when you're a young 
man it's different.

316
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,500
But now you're not so young.

317
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,766
- You're talking about me?

318
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:44,733
Or are you talking 
about yourself?

319
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,433
- Talking about both of us.

320
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:48,033
You know, we can leave.

321
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:48,933
We could go.

322
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,333
- So leave.

323
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,533
- I'm just talkin'.

324
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,000
- Yeah, you're just talking.

325
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,200
You're talking about nothing.

326
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,166
If I wanna hear 
talking about nothing,

327
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,833
I can watch the television.

328
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,866
- Talking about retirement.

329
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,100
- From what?

330
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,900
15 years of unemployment?

331
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,433
I know, you'll get a job.

332
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,133
- Aren't you tired, Lenny?

333
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,466
I mean, you gotta 
retire sometime.

334
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,033
- Retire?

335
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:12,066
You me slacking 
on seventh avenue?

336
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,600
I retired a lifetime ago.

337
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,333
I could never afford it again.

338
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,800
- I'm talkin' about 
gettin' out of here.

339
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,000
Relaxing someplace else.

340
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,933
Both of us.

341
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:20,666
- You're out of your mind.

342
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,933
- Together.

343
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,000
(laughing)

344
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,666
Oh, just stop it.

345
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,366
Stop it, Lenny.

346
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,266
- Oh, that's, that's...

347
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:31,233
Retire.

348
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,466
He wants to retire.

349
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,766
If that's what you 
wanna do, Ruby,

350
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,400
by all means.

351
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,800
But all I got's tied 
up in the market.

352
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,933
Without retirement money,

353
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,200
that's money I gotta finesse.

354
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,966
There's no retirement 
in my future.

355
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,666
God willing I'll 
drop dead tomorrow,

356
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,633
and still have a 
roof over my head.

357
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,633
- [Ruben] Marcy's 
doing very well.

358
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:52,933
- What, Marcy again?

359
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:54,200
Good for her.

360
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,400
- You know, she could come too.

361
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,866
We could all of us retire.

362
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:01,166
But you know, she 
doesn't have to know.

363
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,866
- Doesn't have to know?

364
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,800
What does that mean?

365
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,300
Ruben, I'm sorry.

366
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:11,133
Ruben, my friend, 
my dear friend,

367
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,666
Marcy, who you like 
to call your wife,

368
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,133
who hasn't been faithful to you

369
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,133
for over 25 years.

370
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,933
What makes you think that she'll

371
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,933
wanna give up her 
flourishing career

372
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,533
and stable her 
gentleman suitors,

373
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,800
to sit on a golf course

374
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,166
with her deadbeat husband

375
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,933
and his single 
corrupting influence?

376
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,633
The only reason 
you're still married,

377
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,000
is she's a Catholic,

378
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,400
and you're a 
frightened little man.

379
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
- Oh yeah?

380
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,166
A frightened little man

381
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,766
whose wife pays your way.

382
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:37,000
- [Lenny] Oh, get 
out of my sight.

383
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
- Oh, you can close 
your eyes, Lenny,

384
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,966
but it's still the truth.

385
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,666
- Who's closing his eyes?

386
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,833
Look at you.

387
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,100
You're a shivering 
mouse with an allowance.

388
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,033
You're not a man, Lenny.

389
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,233
Lenny, she's destroying me.

390
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,233
Ruben, your marriage 
with your wife is dead.

391
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:48,900
Over.

392
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,633
You wanna leave?

393
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:50,800
Leave.

394
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,466
This hasn't got 
anything to do with me

395
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:52,400
or retirement

396
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,633
or anything other than fear.

397
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,233
Fear is the only thing 
keeping you from living.

398
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,700
Look, an omen.

399
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:01,000
Tell her it's from me.

400
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,466
For all the help.

401
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,100
Retiring with an old man 
is not an option, Ruben.

402
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,866
Not for you and 
not for me neither.

403
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,100
- [Ruben] Hi hi.

404
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:22,633
- What do you want, Lenny?

405
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,466
- Is that anyway?

406
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,600
What is that?

407
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
How about, Hi Lenny, I 
haven't seen you in a while.

408
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,400
What's new?

409
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,633
You're looking sharp.

410
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,266
How about something 
along those lines?

411
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:34,500
- Sharp?

412
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,700
- Forget it.

413
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,233
Half a pint of water 
in a pint glass.

414
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,400
- What?

415
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,666
- Half a pint of 
water in a pint glass.

416
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,466
- You do look sharp, Lenny.

417
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,833
- [Lenny] Thank you 
very much, Pearl.

418
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,100
- Oh Lenny, how are ya?

419
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,133
- I'm great.

420
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:47,800
Thanks.

421
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Thanks a lot.

422
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,866
Thanks a lot, Molly.

423
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,566
And a beer.

424
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,833
- What do you 
think you're doing?

425
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,033
- What am I doing?

426
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,366
I'm brightening up 
the place, that's all.

427
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,133
I'm trying to make 
an impression here.

428
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,366
- [Pearl] Oh, he's so sweet.

429
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,733
- [Molly] Yeah, he's 
sweet, isn't he?

430
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:04,400
- You hear that?

431
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sweet.

432
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,433
Thanks.

433
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,633
I'm sweet, but I'm also a 
little short today, Connie,

434
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:12,166
and uh, I promised Ruby 
here a little lunch.

435
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,466
Can I get ya next week?

436
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:15,300
- It's all right, Lenny.

437
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,166
I'll get it.

438
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,500
- You're beautiful 
when you smile.

439
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,666
(giggling)

440
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,266
Thank you.

441
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,800
- What about you?

442
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,533
- I lost my appetite.

443
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:58,300
(uplifting music)

444
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,233
- I don't go in there.

445
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:36,466
- What?

446
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:38,966
- That place, that café.

447
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:40,866
It's not for me.

448
00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:42,800
There's a better café 
around the corner.

449
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,966
Nice suit.

450
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,200
- Yeah?

451
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,766
- [Woman] I don't 
like that place.

452
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:49,700
- No.

453
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,366
- Snooty.

454
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:52,400
- Yeah.

455
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,700
I don't usually go in there.

456
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,866
- No, I don't suppose so.

457
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:01,233
It's not for you either.

458
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:02,266
- No.

459
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,833
- Are you all right?

460
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,933
- What's all right?

461
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:12,466
- The day.

462
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,466
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

463
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:16,600
- The day.

464
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,033
- [Woman] Yes.

465
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,433
It's beautiful.

466
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:27,966
(gentle music)

467
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:37,800
- Open the door, please.

468
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,400
Let me out.

469
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,366
(gentle music)

470
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,433
I saw you, didn't you see me?

471
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,733
- What?

472
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,933
- Through the window, I waved.

473
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:57,966
Didn't you see me?

474
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:59,600
- Yes, uh, no.

475
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,700
- Well, I was out there,

476
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,133
and I saw you in here,

477
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:05,666
so I thought I'd say hello.

478
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:07,433
- Well?

479
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,533
- Hello.

480
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:10,400
The truth is I was thinking that

481
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,833
if you were interested

482
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,933
that maybe sometime we 
could have something.

483
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,600
A drink, a bite or 
something along those lines.

484
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,733
You know, if there was 
any interest that is.

485
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,800
Why is that funny?

486
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,366
- No, I smiled.

487
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,933
- Oh, well, that's, that's okay.

488
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:27,733
- Yeah.

489
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,066
- A smile is good then.

490
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,133
So uh...

491
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,500
- No, I was just about...

492
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,233
- Oh.

493
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,166
- No, no no no.

494
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,666
No, I was waiting for somebody.

495
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,466
- Oh, then if...

496
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,166
May I take your number?

497
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,833
(laughing)

498
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,000
It's funny again.

499
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,433
- No.

500
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,600
It's just it's been a long time

501
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,866
since anybody asked 
for my number.

502
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,733
- I don't see a 
ring on your finger.

503
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,833
- Why don't I take your number?

504
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,300
- Oh, I mean if you don't 
wanna take my number

505
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,700
I perfectly understand.

506
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,533
- No, it's better if 
I take your number.

507
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,566
- It is?

508
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh.

509
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,266
Okay, then if it is, it is.

510
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:08,966
The thing is, it's 
a Brooklyn number.

511
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,866
- That's fine.

512
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:11,866
- Good, okay.

513
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,300
Oh, thanks.

514
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,833
(chuckles)

515
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:19,833
Lenny's my name.

516
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,066
Lenny Sugarman.

517
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,066
- Maura Hotchkiss, 
Mimi for short.

518
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,100
- Call me Lenny.

519
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,700
- [Mimi] It's a deal.

520
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,633
- What is?

521
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,300
- Nothing, it's just a joke.

522
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,866
- Okay, good.

523
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,400
Okay, so...

524
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,466
- So?

525
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,200
- I guess then that's it.

526
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,333
- Yes, Lenny.

527
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,566
Goodbye.

528
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,533
- Goodbye Mimi Hotchkiss.

529
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,966
(chuckling)

530
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,133
(laughing)

531
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,300
- That ins't correct.

532
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,966
No.

533
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,100
Did you tell him who it's for?

534
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
And call them back,

535
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,100
make sure it's Marcel or Ida,

536
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,266
or Casper.

537
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,833
Or Ivan, and tell them Zac 
Sugarman wants his table.

538
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,266
There's no if.

539
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:20,900
And I still don't like 
what Horopa's doing

540
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,233
with my callers.

541
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,333
Don't, don't make 
a big deal of it,

542
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,766
but I shouldn't have 
to tell you twice.

543
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,466
Honey, (chuckles),

544
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:30,966
honey, you're my pit man.

545
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,533
I love you too.

546
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,700
- What is that?

547
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,500
- What's what?

548
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,933
- [Lenny] Oh your head.

549
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:40,066
- It's a hat.

550
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,100
- You don't wear a hat like that

551
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,033
at a place of business.

552
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,000
Unless you're a ball player.

553
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,233
Are you a ball player?

554
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:46,200
- Uncle Lenny, I 
have to talk to you.

555
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,033
- I wanna talk to you too,

556
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:47,866
but not with that hat.

557
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:49,300
Off, take it off.

558
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:54,500
- Take a seat, Uncle Lenny.

559
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,300
- I don't wanna sit, 
do you know why?

560
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,766
- [Zac] No.

561
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:58,733
- Because today, not 
like other days, Zachery.

562
00:21:58,733 --> 00:21:59,800
Today's a special day.

563
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,133
- Uncle Lenny.

564
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:01,933
- Today I met the 
most amazing girl

565
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:02,966
in New York city.

566
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:04,200
- I really...

567
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,266
- I mean the kind they 
don't make anymore.

568
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,933
This isn't nothing.

569
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:09,333
I'm talking about 
an elegant lady.

570
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,133
- [Zac] Lenny.

571
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,466
- Don't interrupt.

572
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,100
- I don't have time.

573
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,466
- I'm trying to 
teach you something.

574
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:17,300
This is about love.

575
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,866
Love, Zachery, is more important

576
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:22,300
than all of it put together.

577
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,933
- Okay, we have to talk.

578
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,000
- And if you'd 
listen, you'd learn,

579
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,266
and to learn you must listen.

580
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:28,033
- No, you listen to me.

581
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,000
That's right.

582
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,266
You just listen.

583
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,633
- [Lenny] You don't talk 
to your elders that way.

584
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,266
- Well, I'm sorry, 
but this is important.

585
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,833
- [Lenny] What?

586
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,033
What is it?

587
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,566
I mean...

588
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,266
Nothing is as 
important as respect

589
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:44,633
or maybe love.

590
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,666
- And with all due 
respect, uncle Lenny,

591
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,733
and with love,

592
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:49,700
please sit down,

593
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,666
and let me tell you something.

594
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,200
- What?

595
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
What is it?

596
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,166
Is something wrong?

597
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,733
Are you sick?

598
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:00,800
You're not sick?

599
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,400
- No.

600
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,300
- Then what is it?

601
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,966
- Lenny, are you calm?

602
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:06,833
- Yes, I'm calm.

603
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,800
What is it already?

604
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,866
- Lenny...

605
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,700
You're broke.

606
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,033
- [Lenny] What do 
you mean I'm broke?

607
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,233
- [Zac] The pork bellies.

608
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:19,433
- What about the pork bellies?

609
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:21,666
- It went up in flames.

610
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,833
- Okay, but diversify.

611
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,333
- Filed Chapter 11.

612
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,633
- What?

613
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,000
- [Zac] I always told you.

614
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,966
- What about the gruda?

615
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:31,166
- Time's up on Gruda.

616
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:31,966
I had to sell it 
off with the scraps

617
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:32,766
from the commodities.

618
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:33,966
There's nothing left.

619
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:35,066
- But Gruda's supposed to drop.

620
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:36,500
It's going to drop.

621
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,766
- [Zac] It's too late.

622
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:38,866
- No, I heard it from 
a very reliable source

623
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:40,100
that there's an investigation,

624
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,533
and the bottom is 
gonna fall out.

625
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:42,400
- It doesn't matter, Lenny,

626
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,433
it's not yours anymore.

627
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,666
- What are you talking about?

628
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,900
- I'm talking about 
the same thing

629
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,400
I've been talking 
about for ten years.

630
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,033
- [Lenny] What the 
hell does that mean?

631
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,333
- It means you can't 
draw anymore income

632
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,600
from your investments, 
uncle Lenny.

633
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,933
Your investments are gone.

634
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:58,400
It's over.

635
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,000
- You can't do this.

636
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,766
- I tried to tell you.

637
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:02,233
I warned you.

638
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,066
It's not vegas.

639
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,966
I'm not a bookie.

640
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:06,733
For years, I begged you 
to stop the shorting.

641
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,466
You never knew what 
you were doing.

642
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:10,800
My father always said...

643
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,000
- Oh, your father 
never did anything.

644
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,766
He couldn't wipe his own ass.

645
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,000
- [Zac] No, that's not true.

646
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,133
- No, now don't 
you interrupt me.

647
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:17,700
How dare you?

648
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,300
Rude, and undisciplined, 
just like your father.

649
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,800
- He said...

650
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,400
- He what?

651
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,333
Who paid for your braces?

652
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,233
You're damn right.

653
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,500
I did.

654
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,300
Your father didn't 
have enough money

655
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
for his own son's teeth.

656
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,000
- [Zac] He had a...

657
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,666
- He what?

658
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:35,600
He what?

659
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,133
He pissed it away on hookers,

660
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,866
and you know it.

661
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,333
So don't...

662
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,000
Don't.

663
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,300
(sobbing)

664
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,500
Oh, Ester.

665
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,033
God rest her soul.

666
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,100
Good God, Zachery.

667
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,833
You don't know how 
I love that woman.

668
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,633
Your mother deserved better.

669
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:15,833
- Here's about 5,000 
dollars from a CD

670
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,066
I started a few years ago.

671
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,733
I couldn't watch 
you lose everything.

672
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:26,966
I'm sorry.

673
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:27,966
- Sorry?

674
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:29,766
What is that?

675
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,833
I need to live.

676
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,866
- I'm sorry.

677
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:39,200
- I need to live, 
and you're sorry.

678
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,766
You're supposed to be 
looking out for me.

679
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,700
- Maybe I can help you.

680
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,866
I can give you an allowance.

681
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:50,766
A payment.

682
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:51,433
Every week.

683
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:52,100
(laughing)

684
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,633
Don't do that.

685
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,300
Don't...

686
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,966
(yelling)

687
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:55,400
Don't do that.

688
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,900
You know, I have a meeting.

689
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,833
I...

690
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:00,000
We should talk about this more.

691
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,633
- I would never take 
a dime from you.

692
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,800
Who do you think you are

693
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,300
talking to me that way?

694
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,566
You think you're special?

695
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,800
You're something special?

696
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,066
I have news for you.

697
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,833
If you can sit in here 
with your baseball cap

698
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,266
and call yourself a broker,

699
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:14,966
anyone can.

700
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:16,366
- Okay.

701
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,800
I don't have time.

702
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,566
- Who's, who's the big shot?

703
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:22,933
Who's the big shot now?

704
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,166
- Come back, we'll 
talk more about this.

705
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,866
- [Lenny] Get out of my sight.

706
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:29,833
- [Zac] You're in my office.

707
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,266
- [Lenny] Get out.

708
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:35,733
- [Zac] All right, lock 
the door when you leave.

709
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,833
(gentle music)

710
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,200
(knocking)

711
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,533
- [Ruben] Lenny, it's three 
o'clock in the afternoon.

712
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:47,933
I'm not fooling around.

713
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,833
Lenny, Lenny.

714
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,766
Answer the door.

715
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,766
Lenny.

716
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:59,000
Lenny, open the goddamn door.

717
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,566
(knocking)

718
00:29:01,566 --> 00:29:03,700
Lenny, if I call the coroner 
and you're still alive,

719
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,200
there's gonna be a 
lot of embarrassment.

720
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,766
Jesus Christ.

721
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,533
You nearly gave 
me a heart attack.

722
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,733
- [Lenny] I'm sorry.

723
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,133
- [Ruben] What's the idea?

724
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,100
Where have you been?

725
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,266
Where you been?

726
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,666
- [Lenny] Right here.

727
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:24,000
- [Ruben] Well, why 
weren't you at Eisenberg's?

728
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,433
- [Lenny] I'm sorry.

729
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,966
- Again, you're sorry.

730
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,700
- [Lenny] I forgot.

731
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,633
- We've had breakfast 
every morning for 15 years.

732
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,633
What do you mean you forgot?

733
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:37,133
- [Lenny] I forgot.

734
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:39,266
- Why didn't you 
answer your phone?

735
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:40,566
- [Lenny] I didn't hear it.

736
00:29:40,566 --> 00:29:41,966
- You didn't hear it?

737
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:44,500
First your memory, 
now your hearing.

738
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,700
What's going on?

739
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,800
- [Lenny] I'm tired.

740
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
- You can be tired, I was...

741
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,400
I was worried.

742
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,133
I was afraid

743
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,666
that something happened.

744
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,633
- [Lenny] Nothing happened.

745
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:01,000
- You know, you 
don't look so good.

746
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,266
When you due at the doctor?

747
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:05,566
- [Lenny] I'm not.

748
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:06,466
- You're not?

749
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:08,100
Oh yes, you are.

750
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,333
I'm calling that 
doctor of yours.

751
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,800
Where's your address book?

752
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,600
- [Lenny] No, no.

753
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,533
I'm fine.

754
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,700
- [Ruben] Yeah, you're not fine.

755
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,633
This isn't like you.

756
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:17,666
Here it is.

757
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:18,600
Dr. Kanya.

758
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,133
- [Lenny] I said I'm fine!

759
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,433
- [Ruben] Okay, 
okay, I was worried.

760
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:24,433
- [Lenny] Get out 
of here, will you?

761
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:25,933
- Okay Jesus.

762
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,133
I'm sorry.

763
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:28,200
You gonna be at 
breakfast tomorrow?

764
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,966
- Yes.

765
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,700
(knocking)

766
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,600
- [Ruben] Here.

767
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,333
- I don't need it.

768
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,633
- [Ruben] Why?

769
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:39,300
- I'm flushed, 
I'll explain later.

770
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,200
- [Ruben] Take the money.

771
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,833
- I don't need it.

772
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,200
Get out.

773
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,500
(gentle music)

774
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,266
- [Server] Where's 
the troublemaker?

775
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:48,100
(phone ringing)

776
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,466
- Hello.

777
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:01,700
- Lenny?

778
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,033
Oh, Jesus, Lenny, I've 
been trying you all day.

779
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,000
- Where are ya?

780
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,933
- You don't answer the door,

781
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,333
you don't answer the phone.

782
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,366
You need help, Lenny.

783
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:10,666
Why don't you let me come over?

784
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:11,866
- Where are you now?

785
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:14,800
- [Ruben] Why does that 
matter where I'm at?

786
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,266
- Just go home.

787
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:17,566
- What about the doctor?

788
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:18,566
- I went.

789
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:19,666
- [Ruben] You did?

790
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:20,733
Did ya?

791
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:22,000
- I just said I did.

792
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,266
- Well, what'd he say?

793
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,666
- He said stay home.

794
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:26,400
- [Ruben] What's wrong with you?

795
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,966
- He said stay off the phone.

796
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:29,200
- [Ruben] What?

797
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,166
- [Lenny] I might be 
going away for awhile.

798
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,233
I need rest.

799
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,033
- What?

800
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,033
Well, where you goin'?

801
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:35,133
- Ruben, go home.

802
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,533
- Lenny, Lenny.

803
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,000
Lenny.

804
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,733
(phone ringing)

805
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,133
(phone beeping)

806
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:01,100
Hey, hey you.

807
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,200
- [Zac] I don't have any change.

808
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,600
- I do.

809
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,466
- It's me, it's Ruben.

810
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:06,800
- Uncle Ruben?

811
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,733
- That's your uncle?

812
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:08,633
- No, not really.

813
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,366
Look, it's not my fault.

814
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:11,366
- What's not your fault?

815
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,333
- Yeah, what's not your fault?

816
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,600
- I told that old man for years.

817
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,900
For years I told him.

818
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,800
- For what?

819
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,633
- Nothing, nothing.

820
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:17,633
Is he okay?

821
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:18,500
- You're asking me?

822
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
You saw him last.

823
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,633
What happened?

824
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,333
- Ask him.

825
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,833
- Ask him what?

826
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,433
- Tell him I'm sorry, tell 
him not to do anything,

827
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,233
he can talk to me.

828
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,000
Tell him to call me.

829
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,433
I can help.

830
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,433
- We're gonna be late.

831
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,133
- All right, I have to go.

832
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:31,933
- Who is that?

833
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:32,733
- No one.

834
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,266
My uncle, his friend.

835
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:36,566
- Zachery.

836
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:38,000
- You know what?

837
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,566
Take this.

838
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:41,366
Call me if anything happens.

839
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,633
- Hey, yo.

840
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:52,366
(gentle music)

841
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:43,033
(lively music)

842
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,133
(phone ringing)

843
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,333
- Hello.

844
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,533
This is Lenny.

845
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:34,733
Yes.

846
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:36,866
Yes.

847
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:39,700
Yes?

848
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,433
Mimi?

849
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,866
Oh, oh my.

850
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:46,200
Oh my God, Mimi.

851
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,266
Yes, you...

852
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,700
You caught me at a time...

853
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,666
Oh, what a time.

854
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:55,400
No, no no.

855
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,966
Yes.

856
00:37:56,966 --> 00:37:58,900
Yes.

857
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
No, no it's okay.

858
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,633
It's fine.

859
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:01,566
It's wonderful.

860
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:03,466
It's wonderful that you called.

861
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:05,700
It is.

862
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,466
No, no no.

863
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:09,700
Let's, let's meet.

864
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,000
Let's meet right now.

865
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,866
Yes, now, right away.

866
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:16,033
No.

867
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:17,900
Tonight?

868
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,733
Oh, all right.

869
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,966
Then you name it.

870
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,766
Friday?

871
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:27,000
- [Voiceover] Lenny, 
Lenny it's me.

872
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,900
- What is, what is?

873
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,200
It's what.

874
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,800
Friday then, yes.

875
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,900
Friday yes.

876
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,100
Friday night.

877
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,766
Okay.

878
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,066
- Lenny.

879
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,000
- Friday night.

880
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,666
I'll see you at eight.

881
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,633
- Oh my God.

882
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:49,800
What are you doin'?

883
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,033
- She's your neighbor.

884
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:52,300
- What?

885
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,066
- My date.

886
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,266
Mimi.

887
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,866
The girl I was 
telling you about.

888
00:38:57,866 --> 00:38:59,633
Come on.

889
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,433
Let's celebrate.

890
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:07,466
- A suit?

891
00:39:07,466 --> 00:39:09,233
What are you talking about?

892
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:10,533
- I'm talking about a suit.

893
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:12,866
What do you think 
I'm talking about?

894
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:15,000
You gotta make an impression.

895
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,733
See, even when a person

896
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:18,833
with as fine a quality as Mimi,

897
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,633
an impression is 
the first thing.

898
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,066
The most important thing.

899
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:23,266
- Oh, for Christ sake, Lenny.

900
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:24,233
You've been walking 
around in the same suit

901
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:25,500
for 20 years.

902
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,400
- That's what I'm talking about.

903
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,800
- You don't have 
money for a bus fare,

904
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,566
for a sandwich, for 
a cup of coffee,

905
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:33,266
you're short the 
end of every month,

906
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:34,433
you're short.

907
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,033
So how do you 
justify spending...

908
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,000
What is it?

909
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,866
- 1,100.

910
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:41,266
- 1,100 dollars on a...

911
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:43,366
- It's what's the style.

912
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:44,866
- Feels great, you know that.

913
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,500
It's beautiful.

914
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,933
It's beautiful, Lou.

915
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,066
Isn't it a beauty, Rube?

916
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:53,833
Rube?

917
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,433
- [Ruben] Yeah.

918
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:57,900
- I tell ya, it makes all 
the difference in the world.

919
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,433
- [Tailor] 1,100 dollars 
is 1,100 dollars.

920
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:01,966
That's all I can do.

921
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,400
I'm not kidding.

922
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,100
- I know you're not kidding.

923
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,300
It's a fair price for something

924
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,300
that makes you feel 
like a million.

925
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,900
- Button the top.

926
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,000
- You should get one, Rube.

927
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,300
You know that?

928
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,966
I'm telling ya.

929
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:15,933
You heard of 
Alexander the Great?

930
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:17,300
Meet Lenny the conqueror.

931
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:21,333
What's with this place?

932
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,133
Where is everybody?

933
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:23,066
Why is it so dead?

934
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:23,933
It's dead in here.

935
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:26,266
- We're closing is what.

936
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:27,533
Some intercom what not,

937
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:28,366
I don't know.

938
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:30,000
They're moving in.

939
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,033
They bought the lease.

940
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:34,233
Enough of this crap.

941
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:36,433
I'm moving to North Carolina.

942
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:37,700
Lift your arms.

943
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,933
- North Carolina, you see.

944
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:42,133
- What are you doing 
in North Carolina?

945
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:43,266
- Sleeping.

946
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:43,966
- That's right.

947
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:45,400
Plenty of rest.

948
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,666
- Those idiots.

949
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:47,866
You wouldn't believe 
what they gave me

950
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,500
for the lease.

951
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,166
My front yard's the beach,

952
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:54,000
my backyard's the tenth hole.

953
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,433
(laughing)

954
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,433
- [Ruben] Well since 
you're sitting pretty,

955
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:58,500
how about a break on the suit?

956
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,533
- I'm giving you a break.

957
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:00,433
You wanna break?

958
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:01,800
How about your legs?

959
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,900
You should be more appreciative.

960
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,100
- It's not my suit.

961
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,900
- That's right.

962
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,800
It's not your suit.

963
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,633
It's Lenny's.

964
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,300
And he's not flinching.

965
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,266
Where does somebody like you

966
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,100
get 1,100 dollars for a suit?

967
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,733
It's not for your funeral is it?

968
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:20,066
- Lou, I've known 
you a long time.

969
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,833
So I know I could 
understand how you,

970
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,100
how you could ask 
such a question.

971
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,800
The truth of the matter is,

972
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,333
I've had some success 
in the market.

973
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,966
- A broker, Lenny?

974
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:38,433
Since?

975
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:39,833
I mean, how could you 
tell him that a broker...

976
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,866
- I told him what I 
told him for a reason.

977
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,266
- But you're not 
a broker, Lenny,

978
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,233
for God sakes.

979
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,866
- It's about confidence.

980
00:41:46,866 --> 00:41:50,166
I realize now it's 
all about confidence.

981
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,566
It doesn't have anything 
to do with anything else.

982
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:55,066
You are what you 
are at any moment,

983
00:41:55,066 --> 00:41:57,000
according to your confidence.

984
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,566
- Do you know what a 
confidence man is, Lenny?

985
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,300
- I don't know why I 
never saw it before.

986
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,700
If I had, I could have saved 
myself a lot of misery.

987
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:08,600
Did you see the way 
he changed his tune

988
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,366
when I told him what was what?

989
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:13,466
It's about impressions.

990
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,866
- But you're not a broker.

991
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:18,566
- Watch me.

992
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:21,166
I am what I say I am.

993
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,933
A week is a week.

994
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,100
A month is a month.

995
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,066
What difference does it 
matter when I did it.

996
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,600
The point is I 
did it, it's done,

997
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,933
and I'm opening a shingle.

998
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:30,900
I'm out.

999
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,966
I'm through with the middle man.

1000
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,466
I'm hungry, and I'm eating.

1001
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:36,266
- You're soliciting me.

1002
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:38,233
You come in here, 
you lay down cash

1003
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:39,933
for the big shot shoes,

1004
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,333
and you think you 
can manhandle me?

1005
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,300
The two of you?

1006
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,733
- I'm not any part of this.

1007
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:47,666
- You're absolutely wrong.

1008
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,933
But you're absolutely 
right about one thing.

1009
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,466
This is a solicitation.

1010
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:54,533
And if it is solicitous 
for me to come in here,

1011
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,000
and peddle my, what is it,

1012
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,633
an offer of good 
will and fortune,

1013
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,966
then that's what it is.

1014
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,000
Can I help it if a little 
good fortune has come my way?

1015
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,266
I wanna spread it around.

1016
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:06,033
I want my joy to be for others.

1017
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:08,000
- Ask him to see the license.

1018
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,866
- What license?

1019
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:10,633
- For brokerage.

1020
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:15,433
- I'm comfortable with the 
certificate of deposit.

1021
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:17,466
At least I know what it is.

1022
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:19,066
- If you wanna sleep while 
the rest of us are cooking,

1023
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,833
that's your business.

1024
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,566
But while you're 
in here snoozing,

1025
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,766
I'm talking about 
28 percent a year

1026
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:27,100
for the last five years.

1027
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,433
That's money I'm talking about.

1028
00:43:28,433 --> 00:43:29,900
Not crackers.

1029
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,333
- Where do you come 
up with 28 percent?

1030
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:38,366
- I know what I'm doing.

1031
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,700
I know what I'm talking about.

1032
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,900
That's the figure.

1033
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,700
- I can't sit idly 
by while you do this.

1034
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,500
- Do what?

1035
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
- You're a crazy person.

1036
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,600
What figures?

1037
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,133
You can't tell that to people.

1038
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:47,666
- People?

1039
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,200
Who?

1040
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,000
What?

1041
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,700
- Things, people.

1042
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,400
- These are the most 
comfortable shoes.

1043
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,266
- I mean it.

1044
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:54,066
I do.

1045
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:55,466
Look, it's not right.

1046
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,433
It's gonna come back on ya.

1047
00:43:58,433 --> 00:44:01,166
- What if it's my destiny?

1048
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:04,300
You're the one always 
talking about destiny.

1049
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,133
What if these, the last 
fruitful days of my life

1050
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:09,166
were squandered waiting 
for death's door.

1051
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:11,133
Is that what you're 
suggesting I do?

1052
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,066
My whole life, Ruben.

1053
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:14,633
I felt there was something.

1054
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:16,333
Some reason I was here.

1055
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,566
Something, some purpose.

1056
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:20,300
And since I met this girl,

1057
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,000
this Mimi,

1058
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,866
I've been figuring it out,

1059
00:44:23,866 --> 00:44:25,633
and then she called.

1060
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,800
And everything's 
perfectly clear.

1061
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,433
Ruben, I never felt 
more clear in my life.

1062
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:31,866
I feel alive.

1063
00:44:31,866 --> 00:44:34,466
- A cup of coffee 
makes you feel alive.

1064
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:37,333
It's a moment, a passing moment.

1065
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,833
How are you gonna look 
at these guys tomorrow?

1066
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,033
- I deserve it, don't I?

1067
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:42,133
If some crook can 
lounge his whole life

1068
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:42,966
and collect the rent,

1069
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:44,233
then don't I deserve it?

1070
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,433
- [Ruben] Deserve what, Lenny?

1071
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,633
- You worked hard 
your whole life,

1072
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,100
I know you have.

1073
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,666
Think of it as a reward 
you're giving yourself.

1074
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,300
With all due respect, Sal,

1075
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,733
in two years, in five years,

1076
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:01,200
what do we have left?

1077
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,766
With that kind of compounding,

1078
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,633
your children, their children,

1079
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:06,100
God bless 'em,

1080
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,133
won't be in the kind of 
shape we suffered in.

1081
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,500
- I don't have children.

1082
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,366
- The point is you gotta 
keep the blood pumping

1083
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:16,666
to keep the heart pounding.

1084
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,533
- It's a lot of money.

1085
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:19,800
- What are you doing, Lenny?

1086
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,266
Let's get out of here.

1087
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:22,066
- It's called business.

1088
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:23,933
I'm buying socks here.

1089
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:25,500
- I don't know, Lenny.

1090
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,433
- Which is exactly my point.

1091
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,133
You don't know.

1092
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,466
But luckily I do.

1093
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,500
It's up to you.

1094
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:35,400
I don't have any cause left,

1095
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,466
but you know how to reach me.

1096
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:39,066
- [Sal] Yeah.

1097
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:39,733
- Cards?

1098
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:40,400
What cards?

1099
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,600
You can't just,

1100
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,166
you're over board, Lenny.

1101
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:44,733
You're going right over.

1102
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,200
We're not talking De-near 
fights here, Lenny.

1103
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,633
I'm sure the Weiss' 
are well schooled

1104
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:54,066
in the ways of the market.

1105
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:55,200
- Not really.

1106
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,133
- Of course we are.

1107
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:58,733
- This plant kicks 
the crap out of that

1108
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:00,800
piddling, municipal bond garbage

1109
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,466
the big frims try to sell you.

1110
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:05,900
And letting your money 
sit in a checking account,

1111
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,766
is like leaving 
it out in the rain

1112
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,633
for the birds.

1113
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,300
- So, how much would 
we have to give you?

1114
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,533
- [Lenny] That's up to you.

1115
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:14,933
- We don't have much.

1116
00:46:14,933 --> 00:46:16,333
We're not rich people.

1117
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:17,033
- No, no.

1118
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:18,266
Of course not.

1119
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:19,500
It's whatever you're 
comfortable with.

1120
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,266
- [Miriam] What 
do you think, Mo?

1121
00:46:21,266 --> 00:46:23,666
- Well, if you think

1122
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:25,366
this is a good idea...

1123
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,300
- These are gorgeous.

1124
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,266
Rube, aren't they gorgeous?

1125
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:28,933
- We've known Lenny a long time

1126
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:31,633
and it sounds like a good idea.

1127
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,333
- [Lenny] It's an option.

1128
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,066
- I think we should do it.

1129
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:37,933
How about we start 
with 10,000 dollars?

1130
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:39,066
- Lenny, please.

1131
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:40,666
- [Miriam] It's too much?

1132
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:44,100
- Maybe, we should 
think about this.

1133
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,866
Take our time.

1134
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:46,966
- [Lenny] Sure.

1135
00:46:46,966 --> 00:46:48,633
- I'm sure if Lenny says it's...

1136
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,533
- Think about it all you like.

1137
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:51,633
It's a good idea in fact.

1138
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:53,333
- Yeah, you see that?

1139
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:54,266
- Good.

1140
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:55,733
You should be comfortable.

1141
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:56,900
These are beautiful.

1142
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,133
I'll take 'em.

1143
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:03,333
- We start at 5,000 dollars.

1144
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,333
Okay Lenny?

1145
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:05,366
- Okay.

1146
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:06,666
- Okay dear?

1147
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:09,666
- Well, if that's what you want.

1148
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,666
Okay.

1149
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,100
- Okay.

1150
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,200
- Okay.

1151
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,266
Let me treat you to a haircut.

1152
00:47:20,266 --> 00:47:21,900
Ruben?

1153
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,833
C'mon Ruben, you can 
use a shave at least.

1154
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,033
Frank, give him a shave.

1155
00:47:32,033 --> 00:47:33,400
Put it on me.

1156
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:45,900
You want your pickle?

1157
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,166
You want the pickle or 
don't you want the pickle?

1158
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,566
That's a very simple question.

1159
00:47:52,566 --> 00:47:53,833
- [Ruben] You can have it.

1160
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,366
- I'm gonna take it.

1161
00:47:57,366 --> 00:47:59,633
And there's gonna be 
no further discussion.

1162
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:00,966
That'll be that,

1163
00:48:00,966 --> 00:48:02,366
and I don't wanna hear 
another word about it.

1164
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:04,033
Is that all right?

1165
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,900
That's a good pickle.

1166
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,633
- I love the pickles,

1167
00:48:12,633 --> 00:48:14,733
but, you want it.

1168
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:16,233
- Very nice, thank you.

1169
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:19,133
- That's a lot of money there.

1170
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:22,533
- [Lenny] Yeah.

1171
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,300
Right.

1172
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,566
- So?

1173
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:27,233
- [Lenny] So what?

1174
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:28,900
- So you're a broker now?

1175
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:31,633
- Yeah, right.

1176
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:33,633
- [Ruben] With an 
imaginary licence?

1177
00:48:33,633 --> 00:48:35,800
- What's imaginary?

1178
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,266
- I ran into your nephew.

1179
00:48:37,266 --> 00:48:38,466
I ran into him right before

1180
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:39,300
I came running 
over to your house

1181
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,766
and saw that...

1182
00:48:40,766 --> 00:48:44,100
I saw what was hanging 
from your ceiling, Lenny.

1183
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,966
Now, Zac says he can help.

1184
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,666
He said you should talk to him.

1185
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:50,800
He's your only blood.

1186
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,033
- [Lenny] He's his father's son.

1187
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:53,333
- He has nothing to 
do with his father

1188
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,266
marrying your Ester.

1189
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,400
- He should be indicted.

1190
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,600
- [Ruben] He said...

1191
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,766
- I'm not interested 
in what he said.

1192
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:00,966
- You're not a broker, Lenny.

1193
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:02,966
What you're doing is illegal.

1194
00:49:02,966 --> 00:49:04,500
- [Lenny] I'm not 
a broker and he is?

1195
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,866
- He said he would help you.

1196
00:49:05,866 --> 00:49:06,666
- Help me?

1197
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,633
I don't need any help.

1198
00:49:07,633 --> 00:49:09,800
You think I can't do this?

1199
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,000
I'll make them their 
money, so help me God.

1200
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,266
Don't undermine my 
confidence, Ruben.

1201
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:16,566
That's not a friend.

1202
00:49:16,566 --> 00:49:18,566
That's the worst 
thing you could do.

1203
00:49:18,566 --> 00:49:19,500
- [Ruben] Sit, sit.

1204
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,233
We'll get some more pickles.

1205
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,500
- I lost my appetite.

1206
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:40,600
(lively music)

1207
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:54,366
(lively music)

1208
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:52,800
- Lenny.

1209
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,633
- Oh, hello.

1210
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:56,800
- Hello.

1211
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,066
- You look beautiful.

1212
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:00,233
- Thank you.

1213
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:01,966
Oh.

1214
00:51:01,966 --> 00:51:03,466
They're lovely.

1215
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:05,933
- Thank you,

1216
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:07,133
and oh...

1217
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:13,700
May I?

1218
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,566
- Well, yes, please, of course.

1219
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,333
- Like it?

1220
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:23,633
- Yes, I do.

1221
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:31,433
(laughing)

1222
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:32,500
- Don't you like chocolates?

1223
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
- No, yes,

1224
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,733
I do, I like them very much.

1225
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:36,966
It's like Christmas.

1226
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:37,666
- [Lenny] You don't 
have to take them.

1227
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:38,466
- No, no no.

1228
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:39,966
I, I wanna take them.

1229
00:51:39,966 --> 00:51:42,166
- [Lenny] Oh good.

1230
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:43,533
- Oh wait.

1231
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,633
Give it to me.

1232
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,566
- What are you doing?

1233
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:47,800
- Well, I didn't bring a vase

1234
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,866
and we're having supper, right?

1235
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:52,166
- Oh, okay.

1236
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,333
Should I carry it?

1237
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:55,466
- Well, no,

1238
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:56,600
I don't want you to get stuck

1239
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,900
with a bag again.

1240
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,600
- What does that mean?

1241
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,666
- Nothing.

1242
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:02,466
- [Lenny] I'm funny.

1243
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:03,333
- Yes.

1244
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,166
- [Lenny] Yes.

1245
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,033
Good funny?

1246
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:05,833
- Yes.

1247
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,500
- As long as it's good.

1248
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,800
You hungry?

1249
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,700
- Yes.

1250
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,266
- That's three yeses.

1251
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:12,866
That's gotta be good.

1252
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:17,600
(gentle jazz music)

1253
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:24,566
Are you a coffee drinker?

1254
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:26,466
- [Mimi] Sometimes.

1255
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:27,733
Sometimes tea.

1256
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:29,700
Mostly tea.

1257
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,000
Why?

1258
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,333
- [Lenny] I didn't 
have any coffee today.

1259
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,266
- [Mimi] And you usually do?

1260
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,733
- [Lenny] Yeah, sometimes.

1261
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:38,866
I should have had some today.

1262
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:40,166
- [Mimi] Why?

1263
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,600
- I don't know, 
I'm just talking.

1264
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,033
This use to be one hell 
of a place for a steak.

1265
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:57,400
- I was in buy.

1266
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,633
I bought for all the 
old department stores.

1267
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:01,566
Aldman's, Gimbal's.

1268
00:53:01,566 --> 00:53:03,600
I sent them out of business,

1269
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,866
but it was fun.

1270
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:08,833
I went to Milan, London, 
Tokyo, Hong Kong.

1271
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,066
- I was in Italy once.

1272
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:13,600
- I love Italy.

1273
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,833
I've always wanted 
to live there.

1274
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:17,133
- I remember it all.

1275
00:53:17,133 --> 00:53:19,066
- What do you remember?

1276
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:21,266
- I remember I was a child,

1277
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,833
I remember it was beautiful.

1278
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:25,466
The lakes, the 
fields, the ocean.

1279
00:53:26,366 --> 00:53:28,166
I remember everything.

1280
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:29,633
- Why were you there?

1281
00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:31,433
- We went back, my father and I,

1282
00:53:31,433 --> 00:53:33,233
had to look for my mother.

1283
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,733
Before the war I don't remember.

1284
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:38,666
- [Mimi] I thought you 
remembered everything.

1285
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,266
- I do.

1286
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:44,033
- No, thanks.

1287
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:48,633
And you've never been back?

1288
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:49,966
- I'll never leave New York.

1289
00:53:49,966 --> 00:53:51,433
- [Mimi] Just to visit.

1290
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:53,300
- No.

1291
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,500
What would I do there?

1292
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,000
- It's beautiful.

1293
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,533
- Naw.

1294
00:53:57,533 --> 00:53:59,000
It is, but no.

1295
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,800
- Do you remember your mother?

1296
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,766
- I've never been 
married, you know?

1297
00:54:04,766 --> 00:54:06,166
- No, I didn't.

1298
00:54:07,133 --> 00:54:08,366
- Not that I didn't intend to,

1299
00:54:08,366 --> 00:54:09,566
but I never found 
the right girl.

1300
00:54:10,466 --> 00:54:11,933
If you been married,

1301
00:54:11,933 --> 00:54:13,100
that doesn't matter to me,

1302
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,833
it's, that's your business.

1303
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,133
(laughing)

1304
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:19,233
I don't know why 
I brought it up.

1305
00:54:19,233 --> 00:54:21,600
I wanna say that I 
really appreciate

1306
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:23,700
that you,

1307
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,033
you are going out 
with me like this.

1308
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:27,966
- Like what?

1309
00:54:27,966 --> 00:54:29,833
- [Lenny] Like we're on a date.

1310
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,400
- That's a beautiful 
suit, Lenny.

1311
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,333
- Oh, it's new.

1312
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,533
I got it for you actually.

1313
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:35,466
For tonight.

1314
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:36,200
- [Mimi] You didn't.

1315
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,033
- Yeah.

1316
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:39,666
Boy, did I.

1317
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:41,533
- What do you do, Lenny?

1318
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:43,700
- Ah-ha, that's funny.

1319
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:47,633
It's a good question.

1320
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,266
I'm nothing.

1321
00:54:52,466 --> 00:54:54,500
The truth is I've done 
nothing with my life.

1322
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,233
- [Mimi] I'm sure 
that's not true.

1323
00:54:57,233 --> 00:54:59,233
- It is, that's what's so awful.

1324
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:00,400
- [Mimi] You're 
just feeling glum.

1325
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,733
I'm sorry about your mother.

1326
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:03,133
- My mother had 
nothing to do with it.

1327
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,333
I'm out with the most 
beautiful woman in the world,

1328
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,700
and I'm talking about my mother.

1329
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,733
- It's all right.

1330
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:09,500
- You're never going to 
go out with me again.

1331
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,800
(laughing)

1332
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,433
- [Mimi] Not true.

1333
00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:15,133
- [Lenny] I'm being funny again?

1334
00:55:15,133 --> 00:55:16,000
- Yes.

1335
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,166
- You're just nervous

1336
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:18,100
because you don't know how

1337
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:18,900
you're gonna get out of this.

1338
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,833
- [Mimi] Stop it.

1339
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:20,666
- Why don't you just get up

1340
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:21,933
and get out of here?

1341
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:23,166
- [Mimi] Because I'm 
having a nice time.

1342
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,400
- How could you possibly 
be having a nice time?

1343
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,866
- Because you're 
telling me something,

1344
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:28,166
the truth, or trying to.

1345
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,166
That's rare.

1346
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,766
I'm flattered.

1347
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,933
- You're a knockout, 
you know that?

1348
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,633
You know that, don't you?

1349
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,933
- No.

1350
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:44,066
Let's just have a nice time.

1351
00:55:44,066 --> 00:55:45,600
- [Lenny] I'm having 
a wonderful time.

1352
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,033
(gentle music)

1353
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,633
- [Mimi] Thank you.

1354
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,400
- So, this is it.

1355
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,766
This is where I found you.

1356
00:56:57,766 --> 00:57:00,233
- This is our corner.

1357
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:01,900
- Not a very remarkable corner.

1358
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,366
- Nope.

1359
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:04,633
But it's ours.

1360
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:07,500
- Let me walk you home.

1361
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:10,900
Oh.

1362
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,933
- I'll walk myself home.

1363
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:14,700
- All right.

1364
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,133
If this is a first date,

1365
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,266
when will our second date be?

1366
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:20,433
- Soon.

1367
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:21,533
- Soon?

1368
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:22,766
- [Mimi] Mm-hmm.

1369
00:57:22,766 --> 00:57:24,433
- What kind of an 
answer is soon?

1370
00:57:24,433 --> 00:57:25,533
When will the world end?

1371
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:26,766
Soon.

1372
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:28,666
That's what soon 
is, it's nothing.

1373
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,400
That's what I'm talking about.

1374
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,033
That's soon.

1375
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:38,533
I'll see you then.

1376
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:41,500
- Goodbye, Lenny.

1377
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,133
(gentle jazz music)

1378
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,266
- Goodbye, darling.

1379
00:58:01,633 --> 00:58:03,566
I was in the neighborhood.

1380
00:58:03,566 --> 00:58:04,900
I can come back 
another time, or...

1381
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,866
- No, no.

1382
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:08,133
- May I?

1383
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,366
- Yes, please.

1384
00:58:10,933 --> 00:58:12,133
I'm glad you came.

1385
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:15,100
- [Lenny] I wanted to...

1386
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:17,633
- Leave it.

1387
00:58:17,633 --> 00:58:19,666
- I wanted,

1388
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,400
I wanted, really what I wanted

1389
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,733
was to...

1390
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:25,233
You said you could help me.

1391
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:26,600
- Yes.

1392
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,433
Good.

1393
00:58:28,433 --> 00:58:32,133
- Because, I was thinking 
about our conversation.

1394
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,966
I mean, about some of the funds.

1395
00:58:34,966 --> 00:58:36,466
The ones you talked 
about in the past

1396
00:58:36,466 --> 00:58:39,766
that admittedly I was less 
than enthusiastic about.

1397
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,933
I mean, the mutual funds, 
the money market funds,

1398
00:58:41,933 --> 00:58:45,266
the other funds, that 
which I don't remember,

1399
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:48,100
but first and foremost,

1400
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,866
I was wondering 
if someone wanted

1401
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:53,766
to suddenly, say, invest 
or to do some business,

1402
00:58:53,766 --> 00:58:57,466
or to take some or 
all of your advice,

1403
00:58:57,466 --> 00:59:00,666
how would one come 
to reach some kind...

1404
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:01,900
- What do you mean?

1405
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,133
- I want to do what 
you're telling me.

1406
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:05,033
To do what you been 
telling me all along.

1407
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:06,400
But first I thought 
some kind of,

1408
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,400
a high gain equity.

1409
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,133
Only for a short time.

1410
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:14,366
To boost my capital.

1411
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:15,433
- No, no.

1412
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:16,666
- And then we'd...

1413
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:18,266
And then we go to 
the safe route.

1414
00:59:18,266 --> 00:59:19,700
The Zac Sugarman route.

1415
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,166
That's what I was thinking.

1416
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,533
- What am I gonna do with you?

1417
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:24,466
- [Lenny] And I was 
really thinking that...

1418
00:59:24,466 --> 00:59:26,733
- I can help you, 
but not like that.

1419
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,033
- [Lenny] Then?

1420
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:33,266
- I can supplement 
your social security.

1421
00:59:33,266 --> 00:59:34,333
- [Lenny] Yes?

1422
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,733
- I can set up an account

1423
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:36,866
from which you can draw...

1424
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:37,633
- [Lenny] Any investments?

1425
00:59:37,633 --> 00:59:38,800
- No, no.

1426
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,033
I'm not taking 
anymore investments.

1427
00:59:40,033 --> 00:59:41,900
Let me help you.

1428
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,200
- Well, that's 
what I'm here for.

1429
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,366
- I can set up some 
sort of an account

1430
00:59:44,366 --> 00:59:45,900
from which you can draw

1431
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,733
call it a monthly stipend

1432
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:48,733
if that's what 
you wanna call it.

1433
00:59:48,733 --> 00:59:50,333
- I don't take charity.

1434
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,466
- It's not charity, 
it's what people do.

1435
00:59:52,466 --> 00:59:54,433
It's what families do.

1436
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:56,066
- [Lenny] Families?

1437
00:59:56,066 --> 00:59:57,066
- Well, you may not like it,

1438
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:58,500
but, you are my family.

1439
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,333
- I don't wanna hear it.

1440
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:02,600
- Then I can't help you.

1441
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:05,233
- But listen.

1442
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:06,566
- [Zac] No, I can't.

1443
01:00:06,566 --> 01:00:07,666
- [Lenny] It's just 
for a few weeks.

1444
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:09,533
- No.

1445
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:11,766
If you change, come back.

1446
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:13,200
I mean it.

1447
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,833
But I'm done playing this game.

1448
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:15,766
All right, this game is over.

1449
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:17,066
We do it my way or no way.

1450
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,166
And I don't mean to be 
rude or disrespectful,

1451
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:21,900
Uncle Lenny, but,

1452
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,466
I want you out of 
here right now.

1453
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:38,666
(gentle jazz music)

1454
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,500
- Anta-mintz.

1455
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,400
Remember what I said?

1456
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Remember what I said?

1457
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,333
I hope you were smart.

1458
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,600
Gotta heed the cree, Lenny.

1459
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,466
Heed the cree.

1460
01:01:32,466 --> 01:01:33,633
So, jumped eight points.

1461
01:01:33,633 --> 01:01:35,233
Are ya rich?

1462
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,333
- Jerry.

1463
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:37,000
- What?

1464
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,666
What did I say?

1465
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:38,466
What did I say?

1466
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:39,833
it's a bargain, right?

1467
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,166
- What about scaffolding?

1468
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,500
- Scaffolding?

1469
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,200
- Yeah, who's got scaffolding?

1470
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,133
- I don't know 
who's scaffolding.

1471
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,000
Angst is what I got.

1472
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,100
Angst I know from.

1473
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,766
Angst and hunger.

1474
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,266
- Sure, Joey.

1475
01:01:53,266 --> 01:01:54,133
Here.

1476
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:55,100
I'm running late, Joey.

1477
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,633
Otherwise we'd have a feast.

1478
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,233
Just don't buy any 
booze, all right.

1479
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:02,966
(gentle jazz music)

1480
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:30,833
A-N-G-S.

1481
01:02:32,033 --> 01:02:33,366
Angst.

1482
01:02:35,133 --> 01:02:37,633
I'd like to purchase 
100 shares of ANGS.

1483
01:02:42,566 --> 01:02:45,833
(jazz music)

1484
01:02:58,233 --> 01:02:59,233
How can you be late

1485
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,166
if you set your watch fast?

1486
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:02,333
- What are you doing?

1487
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,000
- Watch ANGS.

1488
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,833
- [Ruben] What?

1489
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,500
- Here is comes.

1490
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,900
- [Ruben] Down five bucks.

1491
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,533
- That's right, highly volatile.

1492
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,066
Up, down, all over the place,

1493
01:03:16,066 --> 01:03:18,733
which is how you make a 
killing if you time it right.

1494
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,366
So, what's so important?

1495
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:26,133
- I'm leaving Marcy.

1496
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:28,633
- [Lenny] Oh Jesus.

1497
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:30,166
- I can't take it anymore.

1498
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:30,966
- Yes, you can.

1499
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:32,033
You can take it all.

1500
01:03:32,033 --> 01:03:33,300
- No.

1501
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,466
- Every three months we 
have this conversation,

1502
01:03:34,466 --> 01:03:35,533
and you realize...

1503
01:03:35,533 --> 01:03:38,233
- I'm leaving.

1504
01:03:38,233 --> 01:03:40,300
- Okay, Ruben, you're leaving.

1505
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,666
- I've got money 
and I'm movin' out.

1506
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:44,966
- Okay, Ruben.

1507
01:03:44,966 --> 01:03:46,466
- Did you hear me?

1508
01:03:46,466 --> 01:03:48,333
I said I've got money 
and I'm moving out.

1509
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,966
- What is this money?

1510
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:52,933
- Never you mind, but it's done,

1511
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:53,866
I've got it.

1512
01:03:53,866 --> 01:03:54,733
That's all you need to know,

1513
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:56,833
and now is the time.

1514
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,900
- [Lenny] Time for what?

1515
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,166
- Time to leave.

1516
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:07,433
- Holy Christ, Ruben.

1517
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:08,800
What are you, what are 
you doing walking around?

1518
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,166
- That's right.

1519
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:14,833
- What?

1520
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:15,900
What are you doing?

1521
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,300
Where, what's it from?

1522
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,366
- I told ya.

1523
01:04:18,366 --> 01:04:19,166
Never mind.

1524
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:20,600
I have an arrangement.

1525
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,866
- Only Marcy's family 
has money like that.

1526
01:04:23,866 --> 01:04:25,500
You're unhappy.

1527
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,266
Does that give you the 
right to make you a thief?

1528
01:04:28,266 --> 01:04:30,100
- Nobody's a thief.

1529
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,500
- Then where'd you get it?

1530
01:04:34,266 --> 01:04:36,366
- I want you to come with me.

1531
01:04:36,366 --> 01:04:37,633
- What are you talking about?

1532
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:39,466
- [Ruben] Going 
away, we can do it.

1533
01:04:39,466 --> 01:04:40,666
- Where you goin'?

1534
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:42,233
- Away, I just can't 
take it anymore.

1535
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,466
- You're not going anywhere.

1536
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:46,766
- You know I was thinking,

1537
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:47,566
there's places,

1538
01:04:47,566 --> 01:04:48,733
there's places in Texas,

1539
01:04:48,733 --> 01:04:51,200
in Louisiana, in Alabama.

1540
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,500
There's places.

1541
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,533
There's trailer 
homes by the sea.

1542
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:57,566
(laughing)

1543
01:04:57,566 --> 01:04:59,600
Trailer homes by the sea.

1544
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,100
- [Ruben] Larger than 
most New York apartments,

1545
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,100
so don't talk about 
what you don't know.

1546
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,033
- Alabama, Ruben?

1547
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:07,533
They don't like New 
Yorkers in Alabama.

1548
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:10,100
What are you gonna 
do in Alabama?

1549
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,200
- It's cheap.

1550
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,266
- [Lenny] She won't 
find you there.

1551
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:15,733
- She'll be happy when I'm gone.

1552
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:17,100
And what are you 
doin' here, huh?

1553
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,966
Spinning your wheels, 
waiting to die.

1554
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:23,733
You can't keep going like this.

1555
01:05:23,733 --> 01:05:25,400
Make it easy on yourself.

1556
01:05:26,933 --> 01:05:29,200
- Oh Christ, I'm not 
going to Alabama.

1557
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,800
I'm not going anywhere.

1558
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,900
Do you think I could 
survive anywhere but here?

1559
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,900
Oh hold it.

1560
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,600
- [Ruben] Lenny.

1561
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,333
- What about the laws of karma 
you're always talking about?

1562
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,566
What about that?

1563
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:42,033
- I mean the laws 
of karma mean...

1564
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:43,466
- The laws of karma, what about 
the laws of New York state?

1565
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:46,333
- Justify taking 5,000 dollars

1566
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,100
from Miriam and Mo Weiss, huh.

1567
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,800
Justify that to the law 
of New York City, huh.

1568
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,166
Justify taking their 
hard earned money

1569
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:53,966
and throwing it 
away on a crap shoot

1570
01:05:53,966 --> 01:05:55,700
just because you 
had too much coffee.

1571
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:02,566
- That's not how it is.

1572
01:06:02,566 --> 01:06:04,900
- Okay, Lenny.

1573
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,300
Tell me how it is.

1574
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:14,166
I don't wanna go alone.

1575
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:21,166
- Well that's how you're going.

1576
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,633
(gentle music)

1577
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,066
- [Mimi] Hey.

1578
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:48,066
- Hey.

1579
01:06:48,066 --> 01:06:49,333
- It's you.

1580
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,566
- It's you too.

1581
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:53,800
- Oh my God, this is so,

1582
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,066
you're just here?

1583
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:57,933
What are you doing here?

1584
01:06:57,933 --> 01:06:59,866
- I'm here, here I am.

1585
01:06:59,866 --> 01:07:00,933
What do you know?

1586
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:04,066
- I just came out of there.

1587
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,133
But, what, wait...

1588
01:07:06,133 --> 01:07:07,733
- I wanna give you something.

1589
01:07:09,133 --> 01:07:10,300
A present.

1590
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,433
- A present?

1591
01:07:11,433 --> 01:07:12,100
- That's right.

1592
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,066
Come with me?

1593
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:14,300
- What are you doing?

1594
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,933
- I'm sorry.

1595
01:07:15,933 --> 01:07:18,300
Have a cup of coffee 
with me, a danish,

1596
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,200
very quick, please?

1597
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,966
(laughing)

1598
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,800
You know I wanna talk to you.

1599
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,266
- What are you doing here?

1600
01:07:30,266 --> 01:07:32,066
- The truth is

1601
01:07:32,066 --> 01:07:33,333
I couldn't wait to see you.

1602
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,366
I couldn't wait to 
see if you'd call.

1603
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:35,666
I had to.

1604
01:07:37,733 --> 01:07:39,033
Wait.

1605
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,266
- What's that?

1606
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:41,066
- It's your present.

1607
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:42,033
I told you.

1608
01:07:42,033 --> 01:07:43,800
- No, Lenny.

1609
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,966
- What no?

1610
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:47,033
- You can't be 
giving me presents.

1611
01:07:47,033 --> 01:07:48,900
That's crazy, you 
don't even know me.

1612
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:49,833
What are you doing?

1613
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:51,266
- It's a present.

1614
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:52,866
A person can't give 
another person a present?

1615
01:07:52,866 --> 01:07:54,700
- [Mimi] It's a ring, isn't it?

1616
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,633
- How did you know?

1617
01:07:55,633 --> 01:07:57,533
- It's in a ring box, Lenny.

1618
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,200
Oh boy.

1619
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,766
What are you doing?

1620
01:08:01,766 --> 01:08:02,933
- When I first laid eyes on you

1621
01:08:02,933 --> 01:08:04,833
it was all over for me.

1622
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:06,300
We don't have much time.

1623
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,400
Just give it a chance.

1624
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,733
- Really...

1625
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,500
I don't know what to say.

1626
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,400
But I can't take the ring.

1627
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,366
And I don't even know 
if I can see you again.

1628
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,166
You're a sweet man, Lenny.

1629
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,566
Really, you are.

1630
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,533
- What are you talking about?

1631
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,466
Take it, take the ring.

1632
01:08:27,466 --> 01:08:29,433
What are you making 
such a big deal?

1633
01:08:29,433 --> 01:08:30,933
Open it.

1634
01:08:30,933 --> 01:08:32,066
Open it.

1635
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:58,533
(gentle music)

1636
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:02,033
- The announcement 
left shareholders

1637
01:09:02,033 --> 01:09:03,566
with more than 53 billion 
dollars in losses.

1638
01:09:03,566 --> 01:09:07,033
Accounting experts expect 
the collapse of ANGS

1639
01:09:07,033 --> 01:09:09,166
will turn out to be 
far more complicated

1640
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:10,800
than what some have called

1641
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,899
a simple case of fraud.

1642
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,466
Shares of the stock plunged 
as much as 80 percent

1643
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:16,866
in early trading,

1644
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:19,466
to close at six 
dollars and 97 cents.

1645
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:24,733
(gentle music)

1646
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:41,433
(screaming)

1647
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:45,000
- What the hell's the 
matter with you, man?

1648
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,300
Damn man.

1649
01:09:49,366 --> 01:09:52,866
(gentle music)

1650
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:08,333
(siren wailing)

1651
01:10:14,033 --> 01:10:15,433
- Jesus H Christ,

1652
01:10:15,433 --> 01:10:17,733
you almost did me a favor.

1653
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,533
What are you doing?

1654
01:10:20,533 --> 01:10:21,700
- I came to say goodbye.

1655
01:10:23,366 --> 01:10:24,400
- You came to say goodbye.

1656
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,200
Where are you going?

1657
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,933
- Alabama.

1658
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:36,700
- [Lenny] Take off your coat.

1659
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,200
(phone ringing)

1660
01:10:50,633 --> 01:10:52,900
- [Ruben] Aren't you 
gonna answer your phone?

1661
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,466
- [Lenny] Let it ring.

1662
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,200
- What if it's your girl?

1663
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:07,200
- Hello?

1664
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:10,300
Well, hello, Mrs. Weiss.

1665
01:11:11,566 --> 01:11:12,800
Yes, I did.

1666
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:14,833
Now now, calm down.

1667
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:15,800
Miriam.

1668
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,033
It's fine.

1669
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:17,733
No, no no.

1670
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:19,366
Don't panic.

1671
01:11:19,366 --> 01:11:20,900
Who do you think 
you're dealing with?

1672
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,233
Do you think I would stack 
the deck with one company?

1673
01:11:24,633 --> 01:11:26,100
- I know what I told you,

1674
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,366
but because of the structuring 
we're immune to all that.

1675
01:11:29,366 --> 01:11:30,600
Not to worry.

1676
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:33,766
Oh, you shouldn't do that.

1677
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,866
Yes, but...

1678
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:41,033
We're looking for a correcting 
trend, starting tomorrow.

1679
01:11:41,866 --> 01:11:43,133
Now don't worry.

1680
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:47,300
No, that's not a good idea.

1681
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,000
That's not a good idea at all.

1682
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,233
Of course I can, but 
I don't recommend it.

1683
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:54,733
Tomorrow?

1684
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,700
Of course, yes.

1685
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,733
Tomorrow?

1686
01:11:58,733 --> 01:11:59,900
All right, all right.

1687
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,533
Yeah, see ya tomorrow.

1688
01:12:01,533 --> 01:12:02,733
Goodnight.

1689
01:12:02,733 --> 01:12:04,333
Goodnight to you too, Miriam,

1690
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:05,833
and my best to Mo.

1691
01:12:07,266 --> 01:12:08,400
Goodnight.

1692
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,833
- What was that?

1693
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,166
- I heard some trouble 
today on the street.

1694
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,166
Did you see the news?

1695
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,533
- Tell me you were diversified.

1696
01:12:30,933 --> 01:12:33,466
Just, tell me what you told 
Miriam was true, Lenny.

1697
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,666
Oh, Lenny.

1698
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,133
- [Lenny] They want 
their money back.

1699
01:12:45,266 --> 01:12:47,866
- What's tomorrow?

1700
01:12:47,866 --> 01:12:50,433
- That's when they want it.

1701
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:51,866
- And you lost it?

1702
01:12:53,066 --> 01:12:54,433
- [Lenny] Everything.

1703
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:09,966
- There's something...

1704
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:12,666
There's something we can do.

1705
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,933
We can make a deal.

1706
01:13:20,566 --> 01:13:22,766
I'll pay them the 5,000.

1707
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,033
Did you hear me?

1708
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:25,433
I said, I'll pay them.

1709
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:26,400
- You'll pay them?

1710
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,266
- Yeah.

1711
01:13:28,266 --> 01:13:29,600
That's right, I'll pay them.

1712
01:13:30,466 --> 01:13:31,800
Under a condition.

1713
01:13:34,766 --> 01:13:36,766
I'll pay them the 5,000

1714
01:13:36,766 --> 01:13:38,700
if you come away with me.

1715
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,900
- What?

1716
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,466
- Will you do it?

1717
01:13:42,566 --> 01:13:44,433
- You got 5,000?

1718
01:13:44,433 --> 01:13:46,066
Plus money to leave?

1719
01:13:46,066 --> 01:13:48,066
- I can get it.

1720
01:13:48,066 --> 01:13:49,866
But we have to be gone.

1721
01:13:49,866 --> 01:13:50,833
I'm gonna be gone anyway.

1722
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,133
I told you I was leavin'.

1723
01:13:52,133 --> 01:13:53,633
- You don't have 
to leave New York.

1724
01:13:53,633 --> 01:13:55,100
If you can get this money, 
then you can get more money.

1725
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,333
- I don't like it here.

1726
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,233
It's dirty, it's 
mean, it's cold.

1727
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,433
This isn't a nice city anymore,

1728
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:03,300
and I'm leavin',

1729
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,533
and I can help you 
settle this thing,

1730
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:06,500
but the deal is you 
come away with me.

1731
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,800
I don't wanna do it alone.

1732
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:26,100
Will you do it?

1733
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,766
- [Lenny] Not Alabama.

1734
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,233
- Doesn't have to be Alabama.

1735
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:33,733
I just want out.

1736
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,600
- [Lenny] Italy.

1737
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,966
- Italy?

1738
01:14:36,966 --> 01:14:37,766
- [Lenny] That's right.

1739
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:39,100
- Italy's expensive.

1740
01:14:40,733 --> 01:14:42,566
- [Lenny] It's Italy or nothing.

1741
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:45,100
- Oh Jesus, Lenny, 
what's with Italy?

1742
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,300
- [Lenny] And there's 
one more condition.

1743
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,300
- Conditions?

1744
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,033
I make the conditions.

1745
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:51,433
- [Lenny] Mimi comes with us.

1746
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:52,100
- What?

1747
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:52,833
- [Lenny] Mimi.

1748
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:54,066
- Lenny.

1749
01:14:54,066 --> 01:14:55,166
- [Lenny] Otherwise 
I won't do it.

1750
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:56,633
- Ah, Lenny, come on.

1751
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:58,200
- It's a deal then.

1752
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,866
And when you get the 
ticket, it's me, Hotchkiss,

1753
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:06,133
H-O-T-C-H-K-I-S-S.

1754
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:11,100
That's hot kiss with 
a C-H for cha cha cha.

1755
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,066
I gotta get busy.

1756
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,466
What is it?

1757
01:15:22,466 --> 01:15:24,500
You'll do it, won't ya?

1758
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,800
- I'll do it, all right?

1759
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,466
I'll do it.

1760
01:15:26,466 --> 01:15:28,466
- Wonderful.

1761
01:15:28,466 --> 01:15:29,566
What difference does it make?

1762
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:30,566
Me you and Marcy,

1763
01:15:30,566 --> 01:15:31,766
me you and Mimi.

1764
01:15:31,766 --> 01:15:32,700
It's better.

1765
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,500
She's a, she's a good girl.

1766
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:39,366
Ah, bingo.

1767
01:15:39,366 --> 01:15:40,400
- What if I said no?

1768
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,200
No deal.

1769
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,400
- You wouldn't do that.

1770
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,266
And you didn't.

1771
01:15:43,266 --> 01:15:45,466
- [Ruben] What if I did?

1772
01:15:45,466 --> 01:15:46,966
- You couldn't, 
because you love me.

1773
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,966
Now get out of here so 
I can make a phone call.

1774
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,700
- [Ruben] I'll...

1775
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,000
I'll see you tomorrow then.

1776
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,066
- Yes, yes yes.

1777
01:16:03,066 --> 01:16:04,900
(speaks foreign language)

1778
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:10,866
Mimi?

1779
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:11,866
- Who's this?

1780
01:16:11,866 --> 01:16:12,966
- What do you mean, who is this?

1781
01:16:12,966 --> 01:16:14,666
This is your lifetime calling.

1782
01:16:15,733 --> 01:16:16,733
- Lenny?

1783
01:16:16,733 --> 01:16:17,966
- You're damn right,

1784
01:16:17,966 --> 01:16:19,600
and don't ask me how 
I got your number,

1785
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,900
because it's right 
here in the phone book

1786
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,233
for the whole world on display.

1787
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,500
That a girl.

1788
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,100
Listen, I'm calling 
to make an apology.

1789
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,933
I shouldn't have done 
what happened today.

1790
01:16:32,933 --> 01:16:34,033
It's...

1791
01:16:34,033 --> 01:16:37,200
I don't know, you move me.

1792
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,200
What can I say?

1793
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,466
I...

1794
01:16:39,466 --> 01:16:41,066
I do foolish things 
because you move me.

1795
01:16:42,366 --> 01:16:43,966
(laughing)

1796
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:44,933
I'm funny with ya,

1797
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:45,966
you see that?

1798
01:16:45,966 --> 01:16:47,300
I make you laugh.

1799
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,033
- Yes, you do, Lenny.

1800
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:50,400
- I wanna make you 
laugh some more.

1801
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,833
I mean, I wanna make 
you laugh tomorrow.

1802
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:52,800
Can I do that?

1803
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,966
- I don't know about tomorrow.

1804
01:16:54,966 --> 01:16:56,333
- It's gotta be tomorrow.

1805
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,500
I'm calling to officially 
and auspiciously

1806
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,800
ask for your hand 
for a date tomorrow.

1807
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,233
What do ya say?

1808
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:04,833
- Call me tomorrow 
and we'll see.

1809
01:17:05,766 --> 01:17:06,800
- [Lenny] Tomorrow then.

1810
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:14,566
- I trusted you.

1811
01:17:14,566 --> 01:17:15,933
- And you can still trust me.

1812
01:17:15,933 --> 01:17:16,900
- We had a deal.

1813
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,833
- I know we had a deal,

1814
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:20,100
but deals change.

1815
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,033
- No, they don't, Ruben.

1816
01:17:21,033 --> 01:17:22,300
That's what makes them deals.

1817
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,000
- I know Italy's expensive,

1818
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,333
but I'm not asking for more

1819
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:26,600
than the arrangement 
we have already,

1820
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,333
and I'll take care of 
'im just like before.

1821
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:33,333
And this, this extra bonus or 
whatever you wanna call it,

1822
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:36,866
is an extenuating circumstance.

1823
01:17:36,866 --> 01:17:37,666
- [Zac] Italy?

1824
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:38,500
That's so far away.

1825
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,466
- That's what he wants.

1826
01:17:39,466 --> 01:17:40,800
That's the only way he'll do it.

1827
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,800
He's on a mission,

1828
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,766
and you want him 
outta your hair.

1829
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,466
- He's the only family I have.

1830
01:17:47,466 --> 01:17:50,166
- Ah, once in a blue 
moon you saw him.

1831
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,366
I mean this is his dream,

1832
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,033
he's always wanted it.

1833
01:17:55,033 --> 01:17:57,033
You'll visit you'll 
miss him so much.

1834
01:18:08,066 --> 01:18:10,033
(ringback tone)

1835
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,466
(grunting)

1836
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:27,766
- What is that?

1837
01:18:27,766 --> 01:18:28,566
- My suitcase.

1838
01:18:28,566 --> 01:18:30,300
What do you think it is?

1839
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,633
You know, this isn't a vacation.

1840
01:18:31,633 --> 01:18:33,600
It's goodbye New York.

1841
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,633
- Did you get the tickets?

1842
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:35,466
- Did I get the tickets?

1843
01:18:35,466 --> 01:18:37,000
Yes, I got the tickets.

1844
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,866
- For Mimi too?

1845
01:18:38,866 --> 01:18:39,700
Well?

1846
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:40,600
- Yes.

1847
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,733
- Let me see them.

1848
01:18:41,733 --> 01:18:42,533
- What?

1849
01:18:42,533 --> 01:18:43,766
You don't believe me?

1850
01:18:43,766 --> 01:18:45,000
- I believe you, I just 
wanna see for myself.

1851
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
- Well, you're gonna 
have to trust me.

1852
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,800
- What's wrong with you?

1853
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,733
You're disgruntled.

1854
01:18:47,733 --> 01:18:49,200
We're doing what you want.

1855
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,400
- Right, and we 
gotta get a move on

1856
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,600
'cause the flight's 
in three hours.

1857
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,066
- You gotta do me a favor.

1858
01:18:54,066 --> 01:18:54,600
- [Ruben] I do?

1859
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,400
- Yes.

1860
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,633
- [Ruben] A favor?

1861
01:18:56,633 --> 01:18:57,566
- Go to the Weiss' and 
give 'em the money.

1862
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,533
- What, you're not coming?

1863
01:18:58,533 --> 01:18:59,433
- [Lenny] I can't.

1864
01:18:59,433 --> 01:19:00,433
- Why can't you?

1865
01:19:00,433 --> 01:19:01,733
I'm giving you the 5,000 dollars

1866
01:19:01,733 --> 01:19:03,666
and I have to deliver it?

1867
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:05,000
I mean, and then 
I have to take you

1868
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,666
in this Mimi woman away with me.

1869
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,100
I must be a pretty nice guy.

1870
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,400
- You are a pretty nice guy.

1871
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,900
And I love you, you know.

1872
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,933
- Why can't you come?

1873
01:19:20,933 --> 01:19:22,900
- [Lenny] I have to pick her up.

1874
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,333
- Okay, but we ain't 
got time to mess around.

1875
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,466
Meet me.

1876
01:19:26,466 --> 01:19:27,533
Where?

1877
01:19:27,533 --> 01:19:28,466
- [Lenny] Where?

1878
01:19:28,466 --> 01:19:29,966
Our corner.

1879
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:31,366
- What the hell are 
you talking about?

1880
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:33,300
- [Lenny] 19th and Irving.

1881
01:19:48,066 --> 01:19:50,400
(ringback tone)

1882
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,366
- [Voiceover] It's Mimi, 
please leave a message.

1883
01:19:56,566 --> 01:19:59,600
- Mimi, this is uh...

1884
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,300
- Lenny?

1885
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,400
- You're home.

1886
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,500
- [Mimi] I've been home all day.

1887
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,600
- I don't like to leave 
a message on that thing,

1888
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,866
because, well, you never know.

1889
01:20:07,866 --> 01:20:09,066
- Where are you?

1890
01:20:09,066 --> 01:20:09,866
- I'm on our corner.

1891
01:20:09,866 --> 01:20:11,066
Where do you think I am?

1892
01:20:11,066 --> 01:20:12,900
I've been down here 
since doomsday.

1893
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,366
Come down here, show yourself.

1894
01:20:14,366 --> 01:20:15,466
I wanna talk to you.

1895
01:20:15,466 --> 01:20:17,200
- You always wanna talk to me.

1896
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,566
- Now you got it.

1897
01:20:18,566 --> 01:20:20,566
- I'll be down in a minute.

1898
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:31,066
(dramatic music)

1899
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:57,033
(ringback tone)

1900
01:20:58,266 --> 01:21:00,333
- [Voiceover] It's Mimi, 
please leave a message.

1901
01:21:03,533 --> 01:21:06,066
- Ah, it's okay if you 
don't wanna see me.

1902
01:21:06,066 --> 01:21:08,200
I understand.

1903
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,966
I'm disappointed, but I mean 
it doesn't make a lot of sense,

1904
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,866
I suppose, you coming 
from your perimeter.

1905
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,033
What with me being who I am

1906
01:21:16,033 --> 01:21:18,000
and you being who you are.

1907
01:21:19,933 --> 01:21:20,966
- [Mimi] Lenny.

1908
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,633
(gentle music)

1909
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,200
Who are you talking to?

1910
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,600
- No one.

1911
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,733
Will you come with me?

1912
01:21:37,733 --> 01:21:39,033
- What?

1913
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:39,766
- I have to go.

1914
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:41,033
Please.

1915
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:42,866
- You have to go where, Lenny?

1916
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,400
Lenny?

1917
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,133
- Italy.

1918
01:21:47,133 --> 01:21:48,333
- [Mimi] What?

1919
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:50,266
- Italy.

1920
01:21:50,266 --> 01:21:51,900
- What about Italy?

1921
01:21:53,066 --> 01:21:54,500
- [Lenny] I want 
you to come with me.

1922
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,266
- Oh Lenny, stop being crazy.

1923
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,933
- I know if you 
don't wanna go, I...

1924
01:22:02,466 --> 01:22:04,233
It's all right then, 
I understand why,

1925
01:22:04,233 --> 01:22:07,666
but I want you to 
let me tell you

1926
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:09,233
something about you.

1927
01:22:10,966 --> 01:22:12,400
- Okay.

1928
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,733
- You make me feel like I,

1929
01:22:13,733 --> 01:22:14,533
like I felt like I did

1930
01:22:14,533 --> 01:22:16,333
when I was a boy.

1931
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:17,566
- [Mimi] Oh Lenny.

1932
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:20,133
- When I was a boy 
I had this feeling,

1933
01:22:20,133 --> 01:22:21,566
that I wanted to love somebody

1934
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:24,066
like nobody ever 
loved anybody before.

1935
01:22:24,066 --> 01:22:25,400
- Oh, please, Lenny.

1936
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,333
- I'm saying that 
this is important.

1937
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,866
I felt like I had 
this love in me,

1938
01:22:29,866 --> 01:22:32,800
and I wanted to 
give it to someone

1939
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,300
and all I had to do was

1940
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,300
just find that person,

1941
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,600
who it was,

1942
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,700
and just give it to them.

1943
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,266
I thought a few times 
I found that person.

1944
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,933
Once I, I was sure.

1945
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:48,766
But...

1946
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,300
She wasn't.

1947
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,800
Anyway, I lived my life 
without her until now.

1948
01:22:56,033 --> 01:22:57,733
Without anything until now.

1949
01:23:00,233 --> 01:23:02,033
I swear, Mimi, I could love you.

1950
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:05,266
I know I could.

1951
01:23:06,366 --> 01:23:09,566
(gentle music)

1952
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,633
I know.

1953
01:23:18,633 --> 01:23:20,500
I know you can't 
come to Italy with me

1954
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,166
or, or anywhere.

1955
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:24,300
I'm silly.

1956
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,833
- [Mimi] You're not silly.

1957
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:27,633
You're lovely.

1958
01:23:29,566 --> 01:23:31,333
- I am?

1959
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,466
- [Mimi] Lenny, you're lovely.

1960
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,033
- Goodbye, Mimi.

1961
01:23:42,566 --> 01:23:45,966
(gentle music)

1962
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:03,133
(lively music)

1963
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:41,133
(lively music)

1964
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,133
You know something?

1965
01:24:53,133 --> 01:24:54,333
I love espresso.

1966
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:55,633
- [Ruben] I know, Lenny.

1967
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:58,366
- [Lenny] It's good, 
and good for you.

1968
01:24:58,366 --> 01:25:00,200
Don't let anyone ever tell you

1969
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,633
espresso isn't good for you.

1970
01:25:01,633 --> 01:25:03,100
Look at the Italians.

1971
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,366
One of the longest running 
civilizations we got,

1972
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,933
and where would they 
be without espresso?

1973
01:25:09,266 --> 01:25:10,333
Don't tell me, I'll tell you.

1974
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:11,633
You know where?

1975
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:12,900
Nowhere.

1976
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,700
- [Ruben] Here?

1977
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,433
- There.

1978
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:27,200
Look at Italian design, 
look at the art.

1979
01:25:28,433 --> 01:25:31,933
Marco Polo, Michelangelo, 
the Medicis.

1980
01:25:31,933 --> 01:25:33,533
- Sophia Loren.

1981
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:35,500
- [Lenny] That's right.

1982
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,433
And where would they be?

1983
01:25:36,433 --> 01:25:38,366
(speaking foreign language)

1984
