1
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,677
It's 7:15, you guys.

2
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,456
- You're gonna be late.
- I know.

3
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:26,435
- God, that guy's such an ass.
- Stacey.

4
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,810
- What? He almost just ran me over.
- You shouldn't be getting out that side.

5
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,645
Go out that side.
Hey, honey, did you get the list?

6
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,343
- I've already done it.
- Great.

7
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,613
- Of course.
- Really?

8
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,279
- Girls.
- I hear it all day.

9
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:41,392
"Your sister was a great student.
Emma loved this book."

10
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:43,255
Stace, enough.

11
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,829
I have a showing at 5.
I'll be home around 6.

12
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:48,694
- Dinner requests?
- Anything's good. Bye, Mom.

13
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,199
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

14
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:52,769
She's the perfect girl
and I'm the bad sister.

15
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:55,498
No, you're not.
Have a great day, honey.

16
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:59,506
Breathe, Em. They're probably
gonna talk about stuff we know.

17
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:02,147
I'm only going
to get out of first period.

18
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:04,476
- We can be a little late.
- Not really.

19
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:07,778
Oh, my dog, you're going to explode
if you stay this tight.

20
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:10,818
Speaking of tight...

21
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,516
Hey, Emma.

22
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,891
"Hey, Emma"?
He fricking knows your name.

23
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,430
- I guess.
- Stephen Sullivan knows your name.

24
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:24,933
- Can we go to class now, please?
- Will you sleep with him? For me.

25
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,268
All right, listen up, everybody.

26
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:31,273
The bus will be leaving
at 7 a.m. sharp tomorrow...

27
00:02:31,432 --> 00:02:34,208
so be on time. Otherwise...

28
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:36,838
Sony, prom queen.

29
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:38,915
- Hey, find a seat. Let's go.
- What?

30
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:42,680
I expect it from Mr. McMullen,
but I'd hope better from you, Emma.

31
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,982
- Sony, Mr. Christiansen.
- All right.

32
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:49,560
So tomorrow the bus will be leaving
at 7 a.m. sharp, all right?

33
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:53,688
Be on time or the bus
will be leaving without you.

34
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:58,428
How'd Lonely Boy get on this trip?
Daddy probably bought his way on.

35
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:00,970
- What?
- You know I can hear you, right?

36
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,006
For the first five days...

37
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:07,634
...we'll be helping to renovate a school
with Project Humanity.

38
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,577
The last three days,
we'll be exploring the island...

39
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:16,017
...and going on cultural excursions,
and it should be a lot of fun.

40
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,118
So headline:
Stephen knows Emma's name.

41
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,889
- Say what?
- I'll trade you for your burger.

42
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,297
- You can have it.
- You sure?

43
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:31,800
- Yeah, I just wanted the fries.
- Okay, so Emma and Stephen?

44
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,404
- I kind of like that.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,234
We have one week on the island
to work our magic...

46
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:38,900
...and get Emma here
laid by the quarterback.

47
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,342
- Do I have a say in this?
- No, not at all.

48
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:44,779
- We're there to be helping people.
- I'm trying to "help" you.

49
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:47,612
We have jobs to do.
I have looked at the itinerary.

50
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:50,051
You made the itinerary.

51
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,350
The school has every day
and night planned.

52
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:55,960
So? We'll change the plans.
That's life, right?

53
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:58,255
Oh, and BT-dubs, I just found out...

54
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,922
...carnival in Trinidad
is when we're there.

55
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:04,399
Oh, my God.
I totally have to get a new bathing suit.

56
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,595
- Really?
- What?

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,765
- Emma's scoping Lonely Boy.
- Oh, he was in my middle school.

58
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,411
- He used to be really nice.
- Yeah, used to be.

59
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,446
I heard he got kicked out
of the last school he was in.

60
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:18,082
I think he's kind of cute...

61
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,378
...in a Rebel Without a Cause,
Holden Caulfield kind of way.

62
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,748
Let me make it simple.

63
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,357
Girls like our Em don't hook up
with freaks like what's-his-face.

64
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:29,323
Especially when she's got
the quarterback on the hook.

65
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:30,655
You can hand me that.

66
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:31,853
- Busted!
- Loser.

67
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,489
- Follow me to the principal's office.
- Well, then lead the way.

68
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:40,668
- Way to go, pal.
- Well done.

69
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:43,399
Looks like someone's
not going on the trip.

70
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:48,173
<i>Well, folks,
it looks like we're in for another...</i>

71
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:51,145
Wow, how long you planning
on staying?

72
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:54,149
You can never be too prepared, Phil.

73
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:56,447
Thank you guys so much
for letting me go.

74
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:02,117
So I had to take a second mortgage out
and Mom has to sell an extra mansion.

75
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,023
Don't tell her that.

76
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:10,264
I love our kids so much.

77
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:14,873
If this is for an eight-day trip, what's
it gonna be like to send her to college?

78
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,371
I know.

79
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:19,905
I'm thinking we have to move
to Princeton with you.

80
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:22,547
- I support that idea. Yep.
- Right?

81
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:24,614
Wouldn't you love that?

82
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:27,115
What are you talking about,
you don't wanna go?

83
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:30,221
Know what strings I had to pull
to get you on this trip?

84
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:32,379
For who, Dad, me or you?

85
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:34,992
I don't even wanna go
on this stupid trip.

86
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:38,460
I'm gonna be forced to hang
with people I never talk to anyway.

87
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,929
It's an opportunity, son.

88
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:46,470
It's a chance to do something
for someone other than yourself.

89
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:50,600
Can we go? We're gonna be late.

90
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:54,143
I'd be stuck here, and you'd have
to look at my face all week.

91
00:05:57,371 --> 00:06:00,648
Let's go, gang. All aboard!

92
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,184
- Be careful.
- Emma, Lizzie.

93
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:03,377
- Be safe.
- Say bye.

94
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:07,151
- Love you.
- Let's get a move. Come on.

95
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,720
Dean, be safe.

96
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:12,830
Will do, Father.

97
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:21,932
How you doing, Emma?
Crazy early, right?

98
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:25,607
That was two sentences.
He's upping his game.

99
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,575
You are so getting laid.

100
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:42,323
Okay, everybody, listen up.
Project starts tomorrow.

101
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:46,430
We have a few hours today
to get settled in and hang by the pool.

102
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:48,965
Then we're all gonna go
have dinner.

103
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,134
What'd I tell you, Em?
Screw your schedule.

104
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,239
This is gonna be the best ever.

105
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:15,049
No locals. Damn. Oh, well.
Who's the lucky boy?

106
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:19,095
Don't worry, Em.
I'm not gonna steal your quarterback.

107
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,666
All right, ladies. Let's do this.

108
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:26,236
One, two...

109
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:30,032
Yeah, ladies.

110
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,444
Don't splash me.

111
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:47,084
- Gotcha.
- No!

112
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,010
All right, man, good job.
Spread it out now.

113
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:15,779
- Hey, hey, hey. Be careful up there.
- Whatever you say, boss.

114
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:19,152
He's gonna get freaking killed
and ruin it for all of us.

115
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:25,525
You should get some lotion
on your shoulders. You're gonna burn.

116
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,960
Day two
and first contact has been made?

117
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,195
Yes, please.

118
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:35,696
This is gonna be easier
than I thought.

119
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:39,674
Looks like Mama's
getting some vac-action.

120
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:43,045
Game on, dudes.

121
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:44,841
- Skyping.
- With the 'rentals.

122
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,315
Okay, get off now.
Seriously, it's urgent.

123
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:49,476
<i>Honey, are you all right?</i>

124
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:53,090
Yeah. Sony, Ms. Collier
is calling lights out.

125
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,487
<i>All right, go ahead.
We love you. Have fun.</i>

126
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,152
<i>- Get a good night's sleep, babe.
- Love you. Bye.</i>

127
00:08:58,318 --> 00:08:59,592
<i>- B ye, honey.
- Good night.</i>

128
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,664
I'm downstairs buying toothpaste...

129
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:04,530
...because I ran out.
Can you believe they charge--?

130
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:05,999
- Losing.
- Okay.

131
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,107
Headline: Carnival party tonight
on some local dude's boat. I know.

132
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:13,870
And Stephen invited us,
and he singled you out, young Emma.

133
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:17,277
They're leaving right now,
but the boat leaves in a half-hour.

134
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,474
- I don't know.
- Shut it.

135
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,380
We are going. You are going...

136
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,522
...even if I have to tie you up
and drag you to the boat.

137
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:26,589
Seriously, we'll be done
by midnight.

138
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:29,955
- Two o'clock, the latest.
- Okay.

139
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:31,289
Yeah!

140
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,352
Carnival!

141
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:33,694


142
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,933
Thank you.

143
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,370
Want a taxi?

144
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,071
Go.

145
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,748
Carnival, bitches!

146
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,944
Hurry, we're gonna miss it.

147
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:04,019
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

148
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,664
- Don't leave.
- Run for it.

149
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,714
This is so fun.

150
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,580
- Hey, ladies, what's up?
- Oh, no, that's okay.

151
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:38,629
Okay, let's get a cocktail
and find your man.

152
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,992
Not my man and not drinking.

153
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:44,328
Em, you've gotta loosen up.
You know, switch it around.

154
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:47,597
- Get out of your element just a little.
- I like my element.

155
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,512
I'm gonna go find Helen.

156
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,971
Is that your new boyfriend?

157
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:25,977
What's it to you?

158
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,474
<i>Monte Carlo.</i>

159
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:33,474
<i>Monte Carlo.</i>

160
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:36,382
Prepare to be boarded.

161
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:41,082
Monte Carlo,
this is the Trinidad Police.

162
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:43,421
Heave to
and prepare to be boarded.

163
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:47,995
Move to the front of the boat.

164
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,361
Move to the bow of the boat.

165
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:55,204
Monte Carlo,
this is the Trinidad Police.

166
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,373
- Emma!
- Help!

167
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:00,205
This is the Trinidad Police.

168
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,745
- What the hell are you doing?
- I fell.

169
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:05,679
- Where's Emma?
- I thought she was with you.

170
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,943
Climb up.

171
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,385
- You all right?
- Just great.

172
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:17,253
What are you doing?

173
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,954
I'm in enough trouble.
I can't get busted.

174
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,963
You crazy? We'll dodge the cops?

175
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:25,194
We'll be fine. We'll go to the hotel
when things cool down.

176
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:28,339
On this?
I wanna get back on the boat.

177
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:38,515
- They're getting too far away.
- We'll hang back and follow them.

178
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:40,575
- We'll be fine.
- Hurry.

179
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,481
We won't be able to see the boat.

180
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:45,248
- How we gonna get out of here?
- I'm working on it.

181
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:48,621
- Do you even know which way to go?
- Be quiet. Let me think.

182
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:52,491
- Damn it, no motor.
- No motor? What now, genius?

183
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:56,265
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

184
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:59,802
We're stuck out here.
This isn't some stupid little thing--

185
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:02,236
Hold on.

186
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:09,913
Please put your suitcases by the door
to be loaded into the awaiting cabs.

187
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,811
I'd like to thank those of you...

188
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:15,545
...who brought this unique opportunity
to an abrupt end.

189
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,985
Welcome, gentlemen.
Glad you could make it.

190
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:20,090
Too bad you're on your way home.

191
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:23,751
- Ms. Collier, Emma's not here.
- What?

192
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:27,390
She never came home last night.

193
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:31,195
I didn't tell anyone because I thought
she was with someone, but--

194
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,861
Okay, well,
how do you know that she's not?

195
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:37,497
You know her. She wouldn't just bail
She has a schedule to keep.

196
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:39,735
I tried her cell. She's not answering.

197
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,379
All right, well,
where did you see her last?

198
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:45,971
On the boat.

199
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:46,313


200
00:13:57,117 --> 00:14:00,690
- How far do you think we've drifted?
- I don't know. Keep an eye out.

201
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:03,596
- Can't be that far.
- We've been out here for hours.

202
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,737
Was this pan of your brilliant plan?

203
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:16,204
- I can't believe my phone got soaked.
- Yeah, I can't believe that either.

204
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:17,507
Try your phone again.

205
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:21,681
I told you,
I'm not getting reception out here.

206
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:26,283
- You want some more water?
- Thanks.

207
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:34,362
I can't believe you brought water
to a party.

208
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:37,502
I didn't wanna get dehydrated.
That gives you a hangover.

209
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:40,069
Really? I thought it was the tequila.

210
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:47,008
I still can't believe there's no motor.
That's the point of the dinghy, right?

211
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,613
For emergencies.
Why else have the damn dinghy?

212
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,114
- What? How is that funny?
-"Dinghy's" funny.

213
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:55,414
It's a funny word, "dinghy."

214
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,616
We're floating in the Caribbean.

215
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:00,656
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

216
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:05,661
I also know freaking out isn't gonna
make us any less screwed, so...

217
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:07,825
So, what do we do?

218
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:12,766
For now, we float, I guess.

219
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,505
Want some gum?

220
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:19,109
Why, is my breath bad?

221
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:20,801
Probably.

222
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,786
- Elizabeth Kover.
- Here.

223
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:32,082
Samuel Leif er.

224
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:34,992
- Here.
- Dean McMullen.

225
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,062
Dean? Dean McMullen?
Anyone seen Dean?

226
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:50,966
- You should try that.
- No, thanks.

227
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,267
You want me to get your back?

228
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,472
- What's with all the Ziplocs?
- What?

229
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,316
You carry all your crap in baggies?

230
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:03,852
It keeps things from getting messy.

231
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,114
- How's that working out for you?
- Well, at least my phone is dry.

232
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:16,294
We should've followed the police boat
back to shore.

233
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:19,266
- What, with a single paddle? Sure.
- I'm just saying.

234
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,463
First of all, I figured we'd be able
to row back in later.

235
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,441
Second, lest we forget, prom queen,
you decided to take a dip...

236
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:29,443
-...in stormy waters.
- I fell off the boat.

237
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,513
And my name is Emma.

238
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,312
Okay, Emma.

239
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:39,720
- Oh, my God.
- What?

240
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,951
- Island, there.
- Where?

241
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:45,960
- Right there. Okay.
- Oh, that's way too far.

242
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,531
We should sit here
until someone picks us up.

243
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,190
Are you kidding?

244
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:52,700
- Fine, I'll paddle.
- Okay, okay.

245
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:55,901
I'll paddle. Jeez.

246
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:05,917
She never made it back to the hotel?

247
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,916
- No. I thought maybe she was--
- Was she drinking?

248
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:11,282
- What's that have to do with anything?
- Was she with Dean?

249
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:14,254
- What? No.
- But he was on the boat?

250
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:18,191
Yeah, but she didn't meet anyone.
And she wasn't hooking up with Dean.

251
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:21,560
- Ms. Collier, tell them--
- Can anything be done to find them?

252
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,598
More than likely, they'll find you.

253
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:27,898
This type of thing isn't uncommon.
It's the youthful spirit of adventure.

254
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:31,440
No, this is my best friend
we're talking about. I know her.

255
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,908
She has no youthful spirit
of adventure.

256
00:17:55,355 --> 00:17:56,766
Dean!

257
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:27,621
You okay?

258
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:30,629
Yeah.

259
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,269
You?

260
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:35,905
Yeah. Think so.

261
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:40,935
No coverage.
We'll have to find a phone.

262
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,336
Great.

263
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,743
Well, wait up.

264
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:01,488
Come on.

265
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:10,103
Really? Who's that for?

266
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:14,006
I don't know. Shoot the bad guys?

267
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:20,743
No, you finish it.
I could use a coffee.

268
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:23,513
Like a mocha ice blended
with an extra shot.

269
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,986
Oh, man. How good would that be?

270
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:33,525
- What was that?
- I hate bugs.

271
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:37,095
Well, you've come
to the right place, then.

272
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:39,134
Let's just find a hotel.

273
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:41,272
We finish working
on the school today.

274
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:44,033
I'll bet everyone's probably
all worried about us.

275
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:47,804
You, maybe. I can promise you
nobody's worried about me.

276
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,144
Yeah, this is Jack.

277
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:54,847
I'm sorry, what?

278
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:59,555
- Excuse me. Mrs. Robinson?
- Barbara.

279
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:03,524
- Jack McMullen. I'm Dean's father.
- Nice to meet you.

280
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:09,392
What were they doing on the boat,
and who was watching them?

281
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,762
- Now, Mrs. Rob--
- Don't condescend to me.

282
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:16,396
Don't you dare condescend to me.
I trusted you with our daughter.

283
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,041
They can't find her.

284
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,871
It's okay, we'll find her.
When is the next flight?

285
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:24,277
There's a redeye tonight
that makes connections in Trinidad.

286
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:27,213
- There's not an earlier flight?
- That's the earliest.

287
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,182
I can help you with arrangements--

288
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:31,481
You've done enough.
Thank you. Let's go.

289
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:37,456
- My feet are killing me.
- I fricking hate hiking.

290
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:43,399
- You wanna wear my Chucks?
- It's okay.

291
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:45,830
Thanks, though.

292
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,736
Hey, look.

293
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,667
- Stop.
- What? They're berries.

294
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:58,475
White and yellow, kill a fellow.
Purple and blue, good for you.

295
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:04,220
You're a little bit weird.
You know that, right?

296
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:06,379
Been called worse.

297
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:38,222
Oh, my...

298
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:44,526
It's beautiful.

299
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:50,200
Come on. We gotta keep going.

300
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:51,994
- Let's just find a hotel.
- What?

301
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,838
We may never get back here again.

302
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,637
- Come on. Take a picture.
- We're already in enough trouble.

303
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:05,146
You know they grade this trip.
I cannot mess with my GPA.

304
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:09,315
Hello? Do you know
how unique this is?

305
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,821
Okay.
What's your number-one school?

306
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:14,384
Princeton. Why?

307
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:19,159
You know how many people
applying to Princeton have a 4.0?

308
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:21,287
A lot.

309
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:24,230
You know how many people
have been swimming in this?

310
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,529
Think of the essay you could write.

311
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,734
Come on.

312
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,867
We gotta find a hotel.

313
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:36,404
So lame. Fine.

314
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:39,448
See, this is why I don't hang out
with people.

315
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:02,404
I can't wait
until we get to a real bathroom.

316
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:04,735
I can't wait for a coffee.

317
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:30,200
Where are we?

318
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,140
We've been walking for hours.

319
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:40,743
And we haven't seen
a single road, person.

320
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,574
We better get back to the boat.

321
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:48,485
Come on, it's gonna be along walk.

322
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:06,430
What if we have to spend the night
on this island?

323
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:09,801
I don't think we're gonna find
a five-star hotel around here.

324
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:13,341
- Do you know how to make a fire?
- I do.

325
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,473
- Perfect.
- What?

326
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:26,784
A cave?

327
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:30,558
I am not sleeping in a cave.

328
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:34,391
It's the safest place to be.
Dry if it rains, only one way in.

329
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:36,658
Protection from the elements.

330
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:38,824
Hey, can I use your phone?

331
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:41,528
Sure. There's no signal.

332
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:47,876
- I'm not a cave person.
- None of us are cave persons.

333
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:50,844
We haven't been cave people
for a long...

334
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:54,875
<i>Go, 90, go.-</i>

335
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:06,791
So that's a no on the cave.

336
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:16,104
Where's the boat?

337
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:58,375
I'm really tired.

338
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:00,175
Can we take a break soon?

339
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:02,683
- Sure.
- Thanks.

340
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:18,800
You see something?

341
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,528
No.

342
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:23,196
Use the flare gun.
You need at least two flares.

343
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:24,898
I saw it in a book.

344
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:29,103
I think it was the one with the girl who
sails around the world with her cat.

345
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:31,908
You fire two flares,
one to get their attention...

346
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:34,381
...and the other
so they can locate you.

347
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,610
Who's "they"?

348
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:38,312
The people that are gonna
come get us, I guess.

349
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,247
Our families and the police
or whoever.

350
00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:47,656
Dean, what are you doing?

351
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:01,603
What was that about?

352
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:06,173
Hey, can I borrow
some of that bug stuff?

353
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:08,819
- Sure.
- Thanks.

354
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,580
- You want a pillow?
- Thanks.

355
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:19,323
- Wait a sec.
- What?

356
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,793
Damn, you should be
on that Price Is Right show.

357
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,404
I knew it was in here.

358
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:32,907
I put it in there in case I got hungry
when we were building yesterday.

359
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,603
Thanks.

360
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:40,579
And I think you meant
Let's Make a Deal.

361
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,479
Right.

362
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:46,952
That show.

363
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:54,058
- Here's some more.
- Thanks.

364
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:07,270
<i>Flight 415 from Detroit to Miami
scheduled to depart at 11 p. m...</i>

365
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:12,576
<i>...is now expected to depart
at 12:10 a.m. from Gate 211.</i>

366
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,615
We're gonna get there.

367
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,832
Why do you call me "prom queen"?

368
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:33,963
- Aren't you?
- No.

369
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:38,438
You seem like you should be.
Perfect girl, perfect world.

370
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:41,510
I can't tell if you're being
mean or nice.

371
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:51,983
What do you think's out there?
In the woods.

372
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:56,255
- We're gonna be fine.
- I know.

373
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:04,433
- Still can't get a signal.
- Here.

374
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:11,072
What are you doing?
You're gonna waste the battery.

375
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,232
Just playing some music.

376
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:21,708
Here.

377
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:23,820
- Take my shin.
- Thank you.

378
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:25,512
Sure.

379
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,859
- Night.
- Night.

380
00:29:38,324 --> 00:29:41,362
They'll come for us. I know it.

381
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,303
What was that?

382
00:30:41,854 --> 00:30:43,356
<i>Hey.-</i>

383
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:45,866
You're a morning person, huh?

384
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:48,229
What are you doing?

385
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:51,170
I'm trying to save us.
What are you doing?

386
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,674
I don't know. Might go for a swim.

387
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:58,481
- Hey, where's your phone?
- Battery's dead.

388
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:05,214
We need some more water.

389
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:46,525
The police have a boat searching
the area where they picked up the kids.

390
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:49,564
- As soon as they come back--
- When will they be back?

391
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:50,756
I'm not sure.

392
00:31:50,923 --> 00:31:53,631
- They said they'd let us know when--
- Any word?

393
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:58,104
I was just telling Barbara the police
have a boat searching the Caribbean.

394
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:00,265
They did say
that a dinghy was missing.

395
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:02,969
- How long they been looking?
- What about a helicopter?

396
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:06,344
As soon as the winds die down,
they're gonna send someone up.

397
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:09,748
Have they been searching land?
Have you contacted the embassy?

398
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:11,819
Is there a private team we can hire?

399
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:14,480
The police are doing everything
that they can...

400
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:17,092
...with the limited resources
that they have.

401
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:19,388
There is no private rescue team.

402
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:21,827
But they did say
they were very confident...

403
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:24,092
...they're going to find
Dean and Emma.

404
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:26,827
The first 48 hours
is the most important.

405
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:30,667
- But the chief said that kids do this
- If I hear one more time...

406
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:31,864
Are you kidding me?

407
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,533
It's been two days.
What are these people doing?

408
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,705
Except offering anecdotal crap
about other teenagers.

409
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:43,643
- All right, look, I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

410
00:32:44,343 --> 00:32:46,584
Help us find our children.

411
00:33:15,174 --> 00:33:17,677
The hut's gonna be something
in case it rains.

412
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:19,516
Rain?

413
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,419
You never know.

414
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:32,760
You okay? Come here.

415
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:39,202
This may sting a little.
Does that hurt?

416
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,310
Here, keep the pressure on it.

417
00:33:48,674 --> 00:33:51,382
So why Princeton?

418
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:57,053
- Why do you wanna go to Princeton?
- I don't know.

419
00:33:57,216 --> 00:33:59,822
- It's Ivy League.
- Yeah.

420
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:03,728
It's just where we talked
about me going.

421
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:08,061
It's kind of weird, right?

422
00:34:08,227 --> 00:34:11,902
It's always been
where I wanted to go.

423
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:14,237
Where I was supposed to go.

424
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,243
I don't think
I ever even questioned it.

425
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:23,143
Yeah.

426
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:27,355
They're not gonna give up.

427
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:31,092
No, they'll come. For you.

428
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:39,029
Thanks, guys.

429
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:42,972
Prepare to board in five minutes.

430
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:47,233
I'm sorry.

431
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:54,442
<i>Did you find her?</i>

432
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:57,549
Not yet, but we will.

433
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:00,918
Yeah, we're gonna
go back out tomorrow.

434
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,958
Sweetie, your mom and I are gonna
need to stay a few more days.

435
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:06,221
Is that okay?

436
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:09,127
<i>Sure. Stay however long you need.</i>

437
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:13,658
There we go.
That should hold for a bit.

438
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,565
Seriously?

439
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,213
Okay, now it's good.

440
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:37,149
Celebration swim?

441
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:40,656
Come on.

442
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:44,853
Come on, it's like a million degrees.
We earned it.

443
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:14,855
I cannot eat any more fruit!

444
00:38:05,397 --> 00:38:08,344
- Hey, prom queen!
- Don't look.

445
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,447
I was just gonna ask
if you had any more sunscreen left.

446
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:14,277
I don't have any more anything left.
Look yourself.

447
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,817
The bottles are in the baggies
in the hut.

448
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:21,014
- I looked for them, didn't see any.
- They're there, but they're empty.

449
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:25,389
I'm sure there's aloe somewhere.
Now turn around and stop looking.

450
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:30,027
You know that every time you say that,
it reminds me I should be looking?

451
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:31,795
I'm serious.

452
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:34,865
You're the one
who asked me to stand guard.

453
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:38,236
There's something out there.
I can hear it at night.

454
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,004
<i>This afternoon,
according to officials...</i>

455
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,477
<i>the investigation
has been downgraded...</i>

456
00:38:44,636 --> 00:38:48,311
<i>...from a search-and-rescue
to a search-and-recovery effort...</i>

457
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:50,919
<i>...as hope of finding the pair alive
has faded.</i>

458
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:52,851
I want you to call me every day.

459
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:56,424
- Sometimes twice a day if you can.
- I will, I promise.

460
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:59,289
I just hate the idea
of leaving you alone down here.

461
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:01,328
I'll be fine. You've gotta go back.

462
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:04,092
Stacey needs one of us there,
especially now.

463
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:06,566
No, I know. You're right.

464
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:11,935
Well, it's official.
They called off the rescue search.

465
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:15,234
See what this is?
They don't have the resources.

466
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,435
That's what it is.

467
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:19,104
<i>--For the families
and the students back home...</i>

468
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:20,807
<i>...who have kept constant...</i>

469
00:39:20,972 --> 00:39:23,009
I'm not gonna stop, Phil.

470
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,981
I promise, I'll bring her back home.

471
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:30,126
I know you will.

472
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:32,828
I know you will.

473
00:39:39,324 --> 00:39:41,930
Jack, thank you for hiring this.

474
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:44,869
We'll keep covering these waters.

475
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,507
We still have two hours
of flying time.

476
00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:03,689
I miss my mom and dad.

477
00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:06,889
I even miss my little sister.

478
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:10,330
And my fish.

479
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:14,867
The smell of my sheets
when they first get out of the dryer.

480
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,875
I'll bet they're still looking for us.

481
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:23,477
They'd have to be, right?

482
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:26,478
- You think they quit?
- Would you?

483
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:32,020
I mean, you keep looking
for something, at some point...

484
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:33,986
...you figure it's gone, right?

485
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:43,831
Why do you do this?
Watch the sunset every day?

486
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:47,796
- Looking for something.
- What?

487
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:55,276
Nothing. It's stupid.

488
00:40:57,602 --> 00:40:59,445
Zippo's dead.

489
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:08,217
What is it?

490
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:18,761
Oh, my God.

491
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,834
How long do you think
he was there?

492
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:26,803
How long do you think he pretended
that he was gonna make it home?

493
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:32,444
This guy is not us, Em.

494
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:34,675
He could've been
some local fisherman...

495
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,012
...or drug smuggler or anyone.

496
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:40,215
You've got people out there
who love you.

497
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:41,789
People looking for you.

498
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:46,892
And you know what else?
We got each other.

499
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:49,396
And that's something right there,
prom queen.

500
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:52,831
We're gonna be okay. You hear me?

501
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:54,800
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you.

502
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:15,584
Why are you crying?

503
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:18,514
That was...

504
00:43:19,811 --> 00:43:22,223
That felt so good.

505
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,295
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

506
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:30,362
It's just...

507
00:43:30,522 --> 00:43:33,298
...for a while, I forgot where we were.

508
00:43:34,893 --> 00:43:37,134
I pictured us home...

509
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:41,169
worrying about what everybody
was gonna say.

510
00:43:43,268 --> 00:43:45,339
I felt so normal.

511
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:15,334
Hey, where's my latte?

512
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:20,277
I'm going to the lagoon.

513
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,285
Dean, did you take
the big water bottle?

514
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:26,885
Dean?

515
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:30,283
Dean?

516
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:32,661
Dean?

517
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:35,722
Dean?

518
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:41,704
- Why would you do that?
- Do what?

519
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,568
Leave me there without saying
where you were going--

520
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:47,903
- You were sleeping.
- And I woke up and you were nowhere.

521
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:51,206
- What are you doing?
- He deserves to be buried.

522
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:53,212
Okay? At least have a funeral.

523
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:59,416
Dean, I don't understand. What--?

524
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:02,558
- Talk to me. I'm here and--
- You're here and what?

525
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,955
We had sex once.
We're stuck on an island.

526
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:06,891
We're not soul mates.

527
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:10,323
That's mean.

528
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:13,492
Yeah, I'm not a nice guy, Emma.
And now you know.

529
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:17,706
I don't believe that.

530
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:20,866
Whatever it is, I'll listen.
Please, just give me--

531
00:45:23,368 --> 00:45:24,938
Emma!

532
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:28,139
I'm so sorry, Em. I didn't mean to...

533
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:30,547
It was an accident. I fell.

534
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,746
I don't know what I'd do
if something happened to you.

535
00:45:37,382 --> 00:45:38,417
What are we doing?

536
00:45:39,717 --> 00:45:43,187
We're not some happy couple
on an island vacation.

537
00:45:43,788 --> 00:45:47,201
How are we gonna make it
day after day, just the two of us?

538
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,669
What if something goes wrong?
I mean, what if I broke my leg...

539
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:54,902
...or one of us gets sick
or something like that?

540
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:57,940
Nobody knows what's out there, Em.

541
00:45:58,103 --> 00:46:01,141
There's stuff that
we don't know how to deal with...

542
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:03,343
...and we just gotta figure it out.

543
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:15,826
I didn't go to my mom's funeral.

544
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:20,934
That's why I wanted to bury that guy.
Just flesh.

545
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:23,402
Ashes to ashes.

546
00:46:23,762 --> 00:46:26,971
I thought maybe seeing him
dead in the ground and all that...

547
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:29,612
...would make things make sense.

548
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:30,905
Did it?

549
00:46:31,603 --> 00:46:33,310
Not really.

550
00:46:34,906 --> 00:46:37,011
I guess that's the point.

551
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,184
It doesn't always makes sense.

552
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:47,626
We need hydrotherapy.

553
00:46:50,388 --> 00:46:52,026
And you kind of stink, so...

554
00:47:13,778 --> 00:47:18,124
Step into my office and tell me
about your problems, Mr. McMullen.

555
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:27,094
I couldn't handle seeing...

556
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:30,000
Seeing all of it.

557
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:36,373
You know, the casket
and all the people pitying me.

558
00:47:36,868 --> 00:47:37,972
Blaming me or--

559
00:47:38,136 --> 00:47:40,207
Why would they blame you?

560
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,213
Because I killed her.

561
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:55,093
She was driving me home
from soccer practice.

562
00:47:55,787 --> 00:48:00,361
We were driving down this side road,
and it was dark.

563
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,233
We used to play this game
when it was snowing...

564
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:11,312
...where she'd flick on the high beams,
on and off.

565
00:48:12,537 --> 00:48:14,983
It'd look like we were going
into hyperspace...

566
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:17,949
...from a Star Wars movie
or something like that.

567
00:48:18,443 --> 00:48:21,947
I reached over, trying to be funny,
trying to be like her.

568
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:26,155
Lost control of the car.

569
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:29,127
We were laughing,
and the next thing...

570
00:48:33,324 --> 00:48:36,134
I was in the hospital for three days.

571
00:48:36,928 --> 00:48:39,272
When I got out, she was gone.

572
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:42,472
You didn't kill her.

573
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,912
No.

574
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:54,823
We should maybe think
about moving here.

575
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:58,517
Nice neighborhood, and I hear
the public schools are great.

576
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:47,132
A month after two students went
missing off the coast of Trinidad...

577
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:50,239
...the search for Emmaline Robinson
and Dean McMullen...

578
00:50:50,394 --> 00:50:51,600
...has been called off.

579
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:55,267
It's believed that the students
have been lost at sea.

580
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:58,107
I can't believe
they're gonna stop looking for her.

581
00:50:58,269 --> 00:51:00,545
Even if it's just for her body
or something.

582
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:03,208
Wow, Helen, that's kind of morbid.

583
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:06,048
Well, her mom's still there.
Maybe she'll find her.

584
00:51:07,178 --> 00:51:08,782
I know we've been over this...

585
00:51:08,946 --> 00:51:11,358
...but if you'd look
at the new information...

586
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:15,828
...regarding weather patterns, you'd see
we've been looking in the wrong place.

587
00:51:15,987 --> 00:51:19,366
Mrs. Robinson,
I've seen this information.

588
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:23,233
- Perhaps your embassy can--
- I've been to the embassy twice.

589
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:46,128
Excuse me,
have you seen these two?

590
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:03,337
Sony, folks,
no planes taking off today.

591
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,514
They say the storm
could last for days.

592
00:52:12,677 --> 00:52:14,350
Yep.

593
00:52:21,085 --> 00:52:23,156
When my wife died...

594
00:52:24,388 --> 00:52:27,426
...l tried so hard to keep her here,
you know...

595
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:29,503
...keep her alive.

596
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:33,499
I almost lost everything I had.

597
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,770
Dean and I barely spoke.

598
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:40,939
I almost lost my partnership
at the firm.

599
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:48,983
I was so focused on what I'd lost,
I forgot what I had.

600
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:55,954
Maybe it's time to go home, Barbara.

601
00:52:58,456 --> 00:53:00,800
It's not like we haven't tried.

602
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,767
It's a tough call.

603
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:46,208
Whenever we were at the beach...

604
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,714
...my mom used to talk
about the green flash.

605
00:53:48,873 --> 00:53:52,013
My dad and I would watch
and watch.

606
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:53,545
I've never seen it.

607
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:58,425
It's supposed to be
right on the horizon line...

608
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,722
...just as the sun comes down.

609
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:04,728
I'm thinking maybe it's just a thing...

610
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:09,803
...people believe in to make them feel
like there's something out there...

611
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:13,807
...you know? Beauty or whatever.

612
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:19,210
How long do you really think
we can survive here?

613
00:54:27,011 --> 00:54:29,924
We're gonna be fine, okay?

614
00:56:13,484 --> 00:56:15,828
Should we feel guilty?

615
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,022
For what?

616
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:22,528
Not being sad all the time.

617
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,267
They probably think we're dead.

618
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,176
But we're not dead.

619
00:56:28,332 --> 00:56:30,573
So we gotta live a little, right?

620
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:34,281
I just feel like
we should be doing something...

621
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:37,112
...like trying to find a way off or...

622
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:38,912
We tried.

623
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,456
We'll keep trying.

624
00:56:45,683 --> 00:56:47,629
Have you been shaving?

625
00:56:47,785 --> 00:56:48,957
What?

626
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,157
You have, like, almost no beard.

627
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:58,597
Okay, first of all, bite me.

628
00:56:59,864 --> 00:57:03,004
And second of all, it'll get heavier...

629
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:04,703
...l hope.

630
00:57:11,676 --> 00:57:12,984
Was that okay?

631
00:57:14,378 --> 00:57:15,413
I mean...

632
00:57:16,313 --> 00:57:18,315
...was I okay?

633
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,895
Emma, you are so much better
than okay.

634
00:57:23,821 --> 00:57:25,300
Okay?

635
00:57:25,456 --> 00:57:30,337
If okay is around here somewhere,
you are way over the damn palm trees.

636
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:34,470
If okay is like a little tiny grain of sand,
you're the whole beach.

637
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:37,443
If okay is like a little drop of water...

638
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:40,445
...you're like
the whole freaking Caribbean.

639
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:42,481
Need me to go on?

640
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,578
Okay.

641
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:50,185
You were never like this at school.

642
00:57:50,848 --> 00:57:52,384
Like what?

643
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:55,462
I don't know, fun.

644
00:57:57,421 --> 00:58:00,891
- You're different too.
- No, I'm not.

645
00:58:01,058 --> 00:58:03,800
Yeah, you kind of are.

646
00:58:04,495 --> 00:58:06,065
How so?

647
00:58:07,531 --> 00:58:09,943
No posse, no books.

648
00:58:10,868 --> 00:58:13,348
I used to watch you sometimes.

649
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:15,749
That's not creepy.

650
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:19,882
You always seemed like
you had a plan.

651
00:58:20,044 --> 00:58:24,015
Like you had something to do
or somewhere to go.

652
00:58:26,116 --> 00:58:28,790
I guess now
you got nowhere to go, huh?

653
00:58:31,822 --> 00:58:34,564
I can't believe I'm saying this...

654
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:38,333
...but I kind of like where I am.

655
00:58:40,164 --> 00:58:44,237
And for the record,
I watched you sometimes too.

656
00:58:49,473 --> 00:58:51,612
Who was your first time?

657
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:56,986
- Oh, we're playing that game?
- Yeah, we are. Who?

658
00:58:58,148 --> 00:59:01,095
I was a sophomore
and she was a junior.

659
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:04,761
- Do I know her?
- No, she was in college.

660
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:07,093
I don't know.

661
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:09,362
I thought she could teach me
some stuff.

662
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:12,367
Was it fun?

663
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,401
All five minutes were a blast.

664
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:24,182
Okay, who was your first?

665
00:59:30,514 --> 00:59:34,860
No, no, no.

666
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:38,488
I told you mine,
now you have to tell me yours.

667
00:59:39,723 --> 00:59:42,863
Football player? Band geek?

668
00:59:43,027 --> 00:59:44,404
- Teacher?
- You.

669
00:59:44,562 --> 00:59:45,597
What?

670
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:49,669
- You.
- Me?

671
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:52,341
I was your...?

672
00:59:54,638 --> 00:59:57,642
- Is that a bad "wow"?
- No.

673
00:59:58,308 --> 01:00:00,185
Just a "WOW H

674
01:00:07,451 --> 01:00:09,260
Was it okay?

675
01:00:10,187 --> 01:00:13,031
I got sand in some weird places.

676
01:00:19,096 --> 01:00:21,076
I'm glad it was me.

677
01:00:21,999 --> 01:00:23,603
Me too.

678
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:28,712
So since this is all pretty new
to me...

679
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:30,749
...maybe we should practice more.

680
01:00:30,908 --> 01:00:32,387
Yeah.

681
01:01:19,423 --> 01:01:21,801
Emma, did you hear that?

682
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:25,566
Plane! Get the flare gun.
I'll catch up with you.

683
01:01:41,945 --> 01:01:43,049
No, no, no.

684
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:49,425
Hey! Hey! Hey!

685
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:55,930
They were too high.

686
01:01:56,093 --> 01:02:00,064
- Did you fire both flares? I didn't see.
- No, I couldn't find the gun.

687
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:03,541
What do you mean?
It's in the same place it's always been.

688
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,180
This is our chance, Dean.

689
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:09,706
I don't understand.
Where could it be?

690
01:02:09,873 --> 01:02:11,853
- Did you move it?
- No.

691
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:14,011
You're the only one
who's picked it up.

692
01:02:14,178 --> 01:02:15,623
So you're saying I lost it?

693
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:19,192
I'm not saying anybody lost it,
I'm just saying it's not there.

694
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:22,363
Someone's been taking our stuff.

695
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:26,092
The baggies and my lotions
and my sunscreen and toothpaste.

696
01:02:26,256 --> 01:02:29,760
- That stuff ran out a long time ago.
- Yeah, but I kept the bottles.

697
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:32,533
I use them for aloe
and for water and...

698
01:02:32,696 --> 01:02:35,734
- Where's the water bottle?
- It's probably there somewhere.

699
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:39,847
- I bet you were organizing things--
- Oh, really, organizing?

700
01:02:40,003 --> 01:02:43,075
That's what happened,
I organized too much.

701
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:48,783
Hang on.

702
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:54,793
- Emma. Emma.
- Get off me.

703
01:02:59,556 --> 01:03:01,900
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

704
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:07,702
I can't. I can't do this.
I cannot stay on this island any more.

705
01:03:07,865 --> 01:03:10,402
What are you gonna do, swim back?

706
01:03:13,971 --> 01:03:15,143
Emma.

707
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,265
Hello!

708
01:03:35,025 --> 01:03:37,335
There's no one out there, is there?

709
01:03:38,695 --> 01:03:42,268
Hello!

710
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:21,912
We've seen one plane
since we've been here.

711
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:24,746
I'm never gonna see
my family again.

712
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:36,125
We'll be better off in there,
long-term.

713
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:38,698
What's long-term, Dean?

714
01:04:39,256 --> 01:04:43,136
Look, Em, at some point,
we're gonna have to say this is it.

715
01:04:43,293 --> 01:04:46,763
This is our life, you know?
It's you and me.

716
01:04:49,967 --> 01:04:51,605
You hear that?

717
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:54,009
It's nothing. It's just the wind.

718
01:04:54,171 --> 01:04:56,845
I'm gonna find whatever it is
and make it stop.

719
01:04:57,007 --> 01:04:58,714
Dean, no.

720
01:05:26,503 --> 01:05:27,538
Dean?

721
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:53,839
Dean!

722
01:06:04,908 --> 01:06:06,387
Dean!

723
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:24,196
Dean!

724
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:56,975
- You see that? You saw it. You saw it.
- I saw it. I saw it.

725
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,781
You saw it. We saw it.
Oh, my God, we saw it.

726
01:10:11,922 --> 01:10:15,870
Think it was the fish?
It smelled a little weird.

727
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:26,211
You think maybe you're pregnant?

728
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:28,616
No, I'm not.

729
01:10:29,473 --> 01:10:32,454
It's not that I don't want kids,
it's just...

730
01:10:32,609 --> 01:10:35,089
- You know.
- I know.

731
01:10:35,245 --> 01:10:36,553
Yeah.

732
01:10:37,447 --> 01:10:38,687
You want kids?

733
01:10:39,516 --> 01:10:41,052
Someday.

734
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:44,257
Me too.

735
01:10:55,332 --> 01:10:58,472
I'd give anything
for some toothpaste right now.

736
01:10:59,403 --> 01:11:02,282
And some chicken soup
and a sad movie.

737
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:06,319
Come here, lie down.
I'll make you feel better.

738
01:11:16,152 --> 01:11:19,224
Do you ever think about
what everybody else is doing?

739
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:23,463
Who's everybody else?

740
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:26,166
Friends, family...

741
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:28,366
...people out in the world.

742
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,242
We're everybody else now,
prom queen.

743
01:11:37,808 --> 01:11:39,583
- What was that?
- What the--?

744
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:53,099
Okay there, buddy. Stop, stop.
Okay, put it down.

745
01:11:53,256 --> 01:11:55,759
Put the gun down
and step away from the vehicle.

746
01:11:55,926 --> 01:11:57,530
Come on, monkey, drop the gun.

747
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:02,042
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
Put it down!

748
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:06,375
Come on, little guy.
I'll trade you, banana for the gun.

749
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:11,450
He didn't even take his banana.

750
01:12:14,277 --> 01:12:16,223
You know what?

751
01:12:17,547 --> 01:12:19,618
What the hell?
What'd you do that for?

752
01:12:19,783 --> 01:12:22,992
- I don't wanna hope any more.
- You're acting crazy. Why did--?

753
01:12:23,153 --> 01:12:26,396
I'm crazy? No, see,
crazy is thinking that we can survive...

754
01:12:26,556 --> 01:12:28,627
...for more than a year on this island.

755
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:30,271
That's crazy.

756
01:12:30,427 --> 01:12:33,897
We're gonna make a life here, Em.
It's gonna be better, I promise.

757
01:12:34,064 --> 01:12:36,670
No noise. I mean,
what's so good out there anyway?

758
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:40,042
Life, Dean.
Life is what's so good out there.

759
01:12:40,203 --> 01:12:43,707
Our families, our-- Everything.

760
01:12:46,643 --> 01:12:48,247
You're crazy if you think...

761
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:51,017
...that I would actually choose
to live like this.

762
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:53,923
This is not living, this is surviving.

763
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:15,181
Any luck?

764
01:13:15,338 --> 01:13:16,840
No.

765
01:13:20,043 --> 01:13:21,317
I never said thank you.

766
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:25,958
- For what?
- For saving me.

767
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,090
For being there. Here.

768
01:13:30,587 --> 01:13:32,089
Emma...

769
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:44,905
- Hey!
- Hey!

770
01:13:45,068 --> 01:13:47,446
- Hey!
- Where is it?

771
01:13:47,604 --> 01:13:49,777
Here, hold this.

772
01:13:49,939 --> 01:13:51,009
Load and shoot, Em.

773
01:13:52,675 --> 01:13:55,019
Pull the trigger, prom queen.

774
01:13:59,216 --> 01:14:00,786
- Over here!
- Hey!

775
01:14:05,054 --> 01:14:10,504
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey! We're here!

776
01:14:21,605 --> 01:14:24,211
Family and friends
eagerly await the appearance...

777
01:14:24,374 --> 01:14:27,412
...of two students lost at sea
for more than three months.

778
01:14:27,577 --> 01:14:29,557
Emmaline Robinson
and Dean McMullen...

779
01:14:29,713 --> 01:14:32,216
...were rescued
by a helicopter pilot...

780
01:14:32,382 --> 01:14:35,556
...on a sightseeing tour
just off the coast of Venezuela.

781
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:37,995
- Hey, get down.
- I don't think so.

782
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:40,828
- There's Emma.
- Emma!

783
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,833
Hey, Emma!

784
01:14:46,396 --> 01:14:49,570
- Over here!
- Emma!

785
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,472
Hey, Emma!

786
01:15:58,067 --> 01:15:59,603
Emma!

787
01:16:04,941 --> 01:16:07,615
I never thought I'd see you again.

788
01:16:18,421 --> 01:16:19,957
<i>- Hey.-
- Hey.-</i>

789
01:16:20,123 --> 01:16:21,796
What are you doing here?

790
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:24,996
I wanted to check on you,
first night back and all.

791
01:16:25,161 --> 01:16:28,472
I was just looking at Facebook
and stuff.

792
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:33,480
- Weird being back, huh?
- Yeah.

793
01:16:35,071 --> 01:16:38,109
They said we don't have to
go back to school right away.

794
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:39,810
Yeah, I know.

795
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:48,160
- Of course you are.
- What does that mean?

796
01:16:49,152 --> 01:16:51,154
Nothing, just...

797
01:16:51,688 --> 01:16:53,827
I guess summer's over, huh?

798
01:16:54,691 --> 01:16:56,466
You're talking in code.

799
01:16:59,229 --> 01:17:01,732
My dad told me about your party.

800
01:17:01,898 --> 01:17:05,539
Mom's throwing it,
a homecoming thing.

801
01:17:05,702 --> 01:17:08,774
Are you gonna come?
Lots of kids from school will be there.

802
01:17:08,938 --> 01:17:11,976
- It'll be fun.
- Yeah, fun.

803
01:17:14,677 --> 01:17:17,556
You should probably go.

804
01:17:17,714 --> 01:17:21,685
My mom and dad have been checking
on me like every 10 minutes.

805
01:17:21,851 --> 01:17:23,524
Sure.

806
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:25,859
Come to the party, okay?

807
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:43,046
First of all,
thank you so much for coming.

808
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:45,447
It's a special day for us.

809
01:17:45,608 --> 01:17:49,715
I can't imagine the courage it took
to survive those days.

810
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:53,827
I really can't.
But I'm so grateful that you did.

811
01:17:53,983 --> 01:17:56,463
To my girl and to Dean.

812
01:17:56,619 --> 01:17:59,429
- Where is Dean?
- Behind you.

813
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,126
I cannot thank you enough.

814
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:04,794
You kids really are
an inspiration to us all.

815
01:18:04,961 --> 01:18:07,271
I mean that. To Emma and to Dean.

816
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:11,037
- To Emma and to Dean.
- Hear, hear.

817
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:12,771
Yeah.

818
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:20,048
- Thank you for coming.
- Thanks so much for having us.

819
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:22,951
How come you're not over there
with everybody else?

820
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:26,093
I'm not really an everybody-else
kind of guy.

821
01:18:26,849 --> 01:18:30,160
Emma is. Always has been.

822
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,324
She's really good at that.
People really like her.

823
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:34,991
Yeah, I can see that.

824
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:37,035
Did you see any sharks?

825
01:18:37,227 --> 01:18:40,538
It took her like two seconds
to become even more popular...

826
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:44,508
-...than before you guys went away.
- Yeah, I can see that too.

827
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,618
- Come <i>on.</i>
- Like the memoirs. You know what?

828
01:18:54,777 --> 01:18:58,452
<i>I can't come. Sorry.</i>

829
01:19:07,323 --> 01:19:09,860
<i>They're calling it
"the miracle at sea. "</i>

830
01:19:10,026 --> 01:19:12,700
After more than 100 days
on a desert island...

831
01:19:12,862 --> 01:19:15,365
...two high school juniors,
Emmaline Robinson...

832
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:18,740
...and Dean McMullen,
have safely returned to their school...

833
01:19:18,902 --> 01:19:21,781
...to their family, to their friends,
to their lives...

834
01:19:21,938 --> 01:19:25,215
...that they thought
they might never see again.

835
01:19:27,443 --> 01:19:29,320
Welcome back.

836
01:19:29,946 --> 01:19:32,051
Excuse us.

837
01:20:05,248 --> 01:20:07,250
I told him I'd think about it.

838
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:11,387
Oh, my God, Em, you're my hero.
You told Stephen...?

839
01:20:12,255 --> 01:20:13,495
You are so the bomb.

840
01:20:23,232 --> 01:20:24,802
Anyway, so I'm gonna wear...

841
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:27,038
Hey, McMullen.

842
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,583
Come on.

843
01:21:27,063 --> 01:21:29,339
Mom wanted me to tell you
it was dinnertime.

844
01:21:29,499 --> 01:21:31,809
- Okay.
- And I was gonna feed the fish.

845
01:21:31,968 --> 01:21:35,211
- Yeah, go ahead. You can feed them.
- Okay.

846
01:21:35,838 --> 01:21:37,840
What's with the dresses?

847
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:39,987
I don't know.

848
01:21:40,142 --> 01:21:42,486
It's all feeling like...

849
01:21:42,645 --> 01:21:44,682
It's all feeling like someone else.

850
01:21:44,847 --> 01:21:48,989
You know, when you were gone,
Mom knew I was there for once.

851
01:21:49,152 --> 01:21:52,463
I didn't have to yell
or get in trouble or anything.

852
01:21:53,022 --> 01:21:57,630
At school,
all the teachers were nice to me.

853
01:21:58,795 --> 01:22:02,106
Even if it was just for pity,
I didn't care.

854
01:22:03,432 --> 01:22:07,380
And now you're the girl
who survived on the island...

855
01:22:08,204 --> 01:22:12,152
...going to prom with
the F'ing quarterback, for crap's sake.

856
01:22:13,009 --> 01:22:18,789
And I'm back to just being me.

857
01:22:21,617 --> 01:22:25,463
Stacey, you're amazing...

858
01:22:25,888 --> 01:22:28,732
...and cool and funny...

859
01:22:28,891 --> 01:22:32,964
...and all of these things
that I can never be.

860
01:22:34,497 --> 01:22:38,775
And just so you know,
I'm not going to prom with Stephen.

861
01:22:39,602 --> 01:22:42,674
Really?
Well, who are you gonna go with?

862
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:45,346
Nobody.

863
01:22:46,242 --> 01:22:47,516
You wanna be my date?

864
01:22:50,313 --> 01:22:53,260
- I missed you, Emma.
- I missed you too.

865
01:22:53,416 --> 01:22:55,726
I missed you so much.

866
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:13,647
I saw it, Mom.

867
01:23:14,237 --> 01:23:16,649
I saw the green flash.

868
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:20,710
It was beautiful.

869
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:23,947
And...

870
01:23:29,785 --> 01:23:33,631
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for not being there at your funeral.

871
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:56,052
And thanks for watching over us.

872
01:24:09,759 --> 01:24:12,569
- What do you think?
- It's amazing.

873
01:24:13,129 --> 01:24:16,667
There's a cute hipster boy
looking right at you, sis.

874
01:24:16,832 --> 01:24:19,005
- He's looking at you, Em.
- Don't think so.

875
01:24:19,168 --> 01:24:20,875
Go.

876
01:24:33,015 --> 01:24:34,494
<i>In front.</i>

877
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:38,325
<i>Three down. Oh, what a save.</i>

878
01:24:38,487 --> 01:24:40,057
<i>Cleared but not out.</i>

879
01:24:40,222 --> 01:24:42,532
<i>Another shot blocked.</i>

880
01:24:45,261 --> 01:24:48,105
- You staying in tonight?
- Yeah.

881
01:24:48,264 --> 01:24:51,143
<i>--The goalie and clears the center
down the ice.</i>

882
01:24:52,067 --> 01:24:53,944
<i>We're just hanging on now, with...</i>

883
01:24:54,103 --> 01:24:56,379
You wanna borrow my tux?

884
01:25:08,617 --> 01:25:10,893
Emma, you look amazing.

885
01:25:12,588 --> 01:25:15,592
Stephen's gotta be going crazy.

886
01:25:19,862 --> 01:25:21,864
He's kind of gross anyway...

887
01:25:22,031 --> 01:25:24,739
...in a smoking-hot kind of way.

888
01:25:25,401 --> 01:25:27,142
Come on, walk with me.

889
01:25:27,303 --> 01:25:30,307
You know,
I knew this was always in you.

890
01:25:30,473 --> 01:25:34,888
It just took being stuck in the middle
of the ocean to find it, but...

891
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:38,417
Let's get you a broody boy.

892
01:25:40,683 --> 01:25:43,630
Oh, my dog

893
01:25:46,055 --> 01:25:48,592
Damn, he looks good.

894
01:25:51,594 --> 01:25:54,734
Go. Be romantic.

895
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:20,758
I've been trying to come up
with the perfect thing to say.

896
01:26:20,923 --> 01:26:24,166
I mean, I...
I didn't even know if I could get in.

897
01:26:24,727 --> 01:26:26,934
Plans are overrated.

898
01:26:34,336 --> 01:26:36,145
I got you something.

899
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:42,581
- Thank you.
- Wanna dance, prom queen?

900
01:26:42,745 --> 01:26:45,954
I'm not the prom queen. I never was.

901
01:26:46,115 --> 01:26:48,595
Never wanted to be. I...

902
01:26:49,452 --> 01:26:51,591
I'm just a girl.

903
01:26:52,888 --> 01:26:53,923
Wanna dance, girl?

904
01:26:55,057 --> 01:26:57,503
It's kind of pouring.

905
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:01,107
- We've been through worse.
- Yeah.
