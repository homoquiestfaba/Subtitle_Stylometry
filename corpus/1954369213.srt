48
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,467
-Give it to me.

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,768
-That's not what it looks like.
-A box oF boomerangs.

51
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:03,468
He throws them, they come back,
hit him and you Film it?

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,402
Congratulations.
You've turned into human beings.

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,802

[licking, smacking lips]

56
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,401
It tastes shiny. It's mine.
Nobody touch it, I saw it First.

57
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,703
What does it do? I don't care.
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine!

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,701
[Verne] Let's just not
have this again.

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,003
Get rid oF the camera. The
camera causes haIF the problem.

-[kids] Yes, Uncle...

-Look out.
-Hey, look what I Found!

70
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:53,802
Is it on right? Is it backwards?
Nobody touch it, I saw it First.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,002
Get away! 'Cause it's mine!

72
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,368
Close your eyes,
young ones.

73
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:00,834
[Heist playing]

74
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:05,370
Follow me into the great unknown

75
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:08,101
Where pink Flamingoes grow

76
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,968
Diet soda Flows

77
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:15,171
And what you take magically regenerates

78
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,835
On supermarket shelves

79
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,701
The ovens clean themselves

80
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,171
You don't pay the tab 'til the last drop

81
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:27,035
So we all ride For nothin'

82
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,369
'Cause this train never stops

83
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,569
