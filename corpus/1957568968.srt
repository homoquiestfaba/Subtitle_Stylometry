00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:02,472
Didn't I ask you to bring the girl back?

184
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,610
Well, fuck Kristof. I'm comin'.

185
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:10,569
Listen to me.
[ominous tones]

186
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,799
[somber music]
[wind blows]

187
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:35,594
[birds squawk]

188
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:52,565
- You okay?
- What do you want, Kristof?

189
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,205
Hey.

190
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:55,845
Don't get mad at me.

191
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,005
This is not my fault.

192
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm just doing my job.

193
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:04,438
And what exactly is that?

194
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:06,160
Your job.

195
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,226
Takin' care of loose ends.

196
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,917
Is that what you are, Ellis? A loose end?

197
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,792
[Ellis] You tell me.

198
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:20,037
You gotta admit, you
botched your last job.

199
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,676
Got your ass whipped
and lost the prospect,

200
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:26,237
who then handed the files that she stole

201
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,756
over to the Russians.

202
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:31,548
In our business, that's not good.

203
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,085
It was only a matter of time before you

204
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,544
and those misfits screwed up.

205
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,996
I told you before and I'm telling
you now for the last time.

206
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,882
The agency doesn't like
when you're careless.

207
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:54,924
Sooner or later, they're gonna
get tired of you, and then...

208
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,032
Well...

209
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:58,701
You know.

210
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,184
What do I know?

211
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:03,201
Huh, Kristof?

212
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:06,348
What do I know?

213
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,698
You've been warned, Ellis.

214
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,393
[phone vibrates]

215
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:49,686
Hi.

216
00:17:51,941 --> 00:17:55,097
[Sparkle] Alex said
you were looking for me.

217
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,556
What do you want?

218
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,910
So it's like that?

219
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,571
Yeah, that's how it is.

220
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,361
[Ellis sighs]

221
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:04,236
I quit.

222
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:08,390
You can quit?

223
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,651
I didn't think they just let people quit.

224
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:12,443
[Ellis] They don't.

225
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:18,561
Well, what do you want from me?

226
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:20,186
A going-away party?

227
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:23,819
I just wanted you to know, okay?

228
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:26,028
I just wanted you to know.

229
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:32,441
Where you at these days? Where you livin'?

230
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,066
I'm with friends.

231
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,430
You need anything?

232
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,521
I'm good!

233
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:39,396
I'm good.

234
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,932
You are the one calling me, right?

235
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:50,165
So...

236
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:57,129
I just need you to look into
something for me, that's it.

237
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:04,370
I'll let you know, if
you let me know what's up.

238
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,710
All right.

239
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:14,499
All right, so, there's this
guy lookin' for me, right?

240
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,811
They sent him to kill me.

241
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:19,411
So the thing is, I gotta
find him before he finds me.

242
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:22,659
So this is what I need you to do.

243
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:25,201
I'm sending you a picture now.

244
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:28,698
[Associate] Didn't I
tell you? I warned you!

245
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,990
Kristof is off the leash!

246
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:34,790
There's no way out, other
than death, and you knew this.

247
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:38,691
Bring us our file back.
Consider it, Ellis!

248
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:43,339
You're the one who's fucked!
You have no family, no nothin'!

249
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,798
[dark music]

250
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:53,572
Take the girl back. She's
not worth the trouble.

251
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,301
[Ellis] Excuse me.

252
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:01,587
[Blonde Woman] May I help you?

253
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,306
Yeah, I'm just looking
for Maria. Is she...

254
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:05,860
[Blonde Woman] She's gone for the night.

255
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:07,652
Maybe I can help you.

256
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:11,439
You and me are a lot alike.

257
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:12,398
I can tell.

258
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:15,423
You see the opportunity,

259
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:19,549
you take advantage of it.

260
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:22,341
[crickets chirp]

261
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:28,555
[Ellis] It's crazy
when you think about it.

262
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:33,505
You rack your brain, trying
to come up with answers.

263
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:38,047
All along, it was sittin'
right there in front of you.

264
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,539
I'll be damned.

265
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:57,282
Hi.

266
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,703
Hi.

267
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,793
I have to run an errand real fast.

268
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:09,436
Please, do not answer the door.

269
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:13,811
Stay away from the windows
and don't use your phone.

270
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,744
Can you remember that?

271
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,643
Good.

272
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:29,072
[gentle music]

273
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:35,729
What size are you?

274
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,363
It's just, you're the
same size as my ex-wife.

275
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,528
She has a closet full of some
really nice stuff in there

276
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,237
that I think will fit you and...

277
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,357
If you wanna get outta that,
you just take a shower and, um,

278
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:57,909
get changed up, if you feel like it, okay?

279
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:58,951
If you want.

280
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,432
Okay?

281
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,663
But I really gotta go.

282
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,603
Um...

283
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:15,014
Really need you to not
answer the door, right?

284
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,713
And stay away from the windows.

285
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:25,157
Don't answer the phone.

286
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,328
[Ellis] [chuckles] Yeah.

287
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,953
I'll be right back.

288
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:47,611
[muffled electronic music]

289
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,153
[phone rings]

290
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:56,436
[phone rings]
[laughter and chatter]

291
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,311
Sparkle.

292
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,578
- This is crazy.
- Sparkle, calm down.

293
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,584
There are so many girls.
So many young girls.

294
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:04,312
[Ellis] Sparkle. Sparkle, listen to me.

295
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:06,264
Don't "Sparkle" me! Don't "Sparkle" me.

296
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:07,632
It's not even my name. Don't "Sparkle" me.

297
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:12,257
I have no idea what I'm doing. [sighs]

298
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:15,726
[Ellis] I'm sorry. You okay?

299
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:18,182
Don't worry about me.

300
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:20,126
I found him, if that's
what you're wondering.

301
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:22,496
[Ellis] You found him?

302
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:24,306
Where are you?

303
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:25,431
I lost him.

304
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:31,206
Do me a favor. Don't call me anymore.

305
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:32,776
This is the first and the last time

306
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:35,576
I do something like this for you.

307
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:37,535
[Ellis] I understand.

308
00:23:39,437 --> 00:23:40,803
Anything I can do?

309
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:44,595
I'll find him, but
after that, I'm through.

310
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:50,793
[sighs] There's gotta be a
better way to make money.

311
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:57,214
I'll be in touch.

312
00:23:57,256 --> 00:24:00,711
[Ellis] When you find him,
be careful. He's dangerous.

313
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:02,170
I'm a big girl.

314
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:07,289
Besides, danger is my middle name.

315
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,216
[sighs]

316
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:17,736
[suspenseful music]

317
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,039
Thirsty?

318
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:44,938
I'm good.

319
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,256
- Really?
- Yeah.

320
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:48,881
- You look like thirsty.
- I do?

321
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:55,938
I'm the kinda man that
gets what I'm looking for.

322
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,480
Do you understand?

323
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:02,696
I've done a lot of things
in my life I'm not proud of.

324
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:04,405
Some of it I regret.

325
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,366
Right now, I'm just searching.

326
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:12,325
For what?

327
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:17,441
I just want to feel...

328
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,587
I just want to feel again.

329
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:24,081
Feel what?

330
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,559
Do you know what it
is I do for a living?

331
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:34,434
No.

332
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,503
No.

333
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,647
Let's just cut the bullshit,

334
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:47,967
and talk about why I'm
really here, how about that?

335
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,868
You have a blonde that works for you.

336
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,858
I believe she's Russian.

337
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,138
She took something that
belongs to me. I want it back.

338
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,930
I called you. You said you
were gonna look into it and...

339
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:05,087
I understand you have a
problem with one of my girls.

340
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:06,239
- I do.
- You do?

341
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:07,614
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

342
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,333
And?

343
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:16,739
In the past, there have been
so many girls of your liking,

344
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,110
and since most of my girls are Russian,

345
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,827
it was hard to find the
one you were looking for.

346
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:25,170
Mm.

347
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:26,599
But I did find her.

348
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,218
You found her?

349
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,778
And I spoke with her personally.

350
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,947
You spoke to her personally?

351
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,338
- Mm-hm.
- And?

352
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,628
Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to have

353
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,420
any of your property.

354
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:39,679
I apologize for the inconvenience,

355
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:43,471
but maybe you've misplaced
it somewhere else?

356
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,903
That is unfortunate.

357
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:52,957
Because the people who need
that file, they're willin' to do

358
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:56,582
unimaginable things to
you, to get it back,

359
00:26:57,812 --> 00:27:00,645
and I don't wanna see that happen.

360
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:04,084

I've been waiting on
this day for a long time.

728
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:46,728
Gotta look my best, you know.

729
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:47,603
Ow!

730
00:56:50,142 --> 00:56:53,748
So what is this now for us? 16, 17?

Are you sure?

00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,893
Yeah.

735

736
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:05,034
Sorry.

737
00:57:06,651 --> 00:57:09,651
And don't you always look your best?

738
00:57:10,811 --> 00:57:11,811
Yes. I do.

739
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:20,968
Sorry about that.

740
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,010
It's okay.

741
00:57:24,022 --> 00:57:26,189
This will be no different.

742
00:57:34,011 --> 00:57:35,129

Great. How much do I owe you?

This one's on me.

748
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:57,612
I can't take-

749
00:57:57,654 --> 00:57:59,111

750
00:57:59,153 --> 00:58:02,153
It's not necessary. I can pay you.

751

I've done suits for you
for every special occasion.

It's true.

757
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:25,334
And now you say this is...

758
00:58:26,812 --> 00:58:28,229
This is our last.

759
00:58:30,862 --> 00:58:33,529
So, this is me saying thank you.

Anything?

766
00:59:05,862 --> 00:59:09,529
Then can you tell me
what's really going on?

767
00:59:12,141 --> 00:59:13,641
And I mean really.

768
00:59:22,543 --> 00:59:23,376
I can't.

769
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:29,343
Well, then can you at
least let me help you

770
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:33,302

you're not tellin' me?

I can help you.

772
00:59:41,325 --> 00:59:42,408
I can be very

773
00:59:45,714 --> 00:59:46,714

Okay.

777
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:09,271
Can you at least do me one favor?

778
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:10,146
Just one.

779
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:18,463
Ease up off the weights a little bit.

780

gonna be tearin' through

you were gonna be home early.

[Ellis] I know, I
know. It was important.

796

Uh-huh. Well, it's always something.

797
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:20,791
[chuckles] Well, can you at least tell me

798
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,892
when you're gonna be home?

799
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:25,582
- Why?
- Well, hello! [chuckles]

800
01:01:25,624 --> 01:01:27,492
You know you're supposed

[Julia] Okay, well...

807
01:01:42,904 --> 01:01:44,372
- You gonna be okay?
- No, no.

808
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,081
Yeah, I'll be fine.

809
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,709

be there real soon.

Mm-hm.

813

- Yes, I'm serious.

30 minutes. [chuckles]

816
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:10,130
If you're not home in 30 you
are going to be in big trouble.

817

[Ellis] Like that, huh? [chuckles]

818
01:02:12,721 --> 01:02:13,554
Yeah.

01:04:18,143 --> 01:04:18,976
Overrated,

01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:21,826
in so many ways.

831
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:24,406
Rough.

Unpolished.

The only question is, what
happens between now and then.

845

You tell me what I wanna
know, and I can be kind.
