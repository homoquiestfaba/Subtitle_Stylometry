00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,617
We can't keep her in
our joey pouches forevz.

187
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:27,283
- I know.

188
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:28,863
But you know what day it is

189
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:30,740
and we've spent a really long time

190
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,140
preparing for tonight.

191
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,630
- Yeah, I know all this,
blah, blah, blah shite.

192
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,547
You've got to let her go, JTRO.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,833
- I know.

194
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:41,783
But CHAI.

195
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:46,819
What the fuck comes after tonight?

196
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:49,450
What the fuck happens after this?

197
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,819

00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:55,320
Hey, calm-a-do.

00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:02,443
- Awe, Omega Awks.

201
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,318
P-D-Fuckin' A.

202
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:06,478
- Oh, you got your Prezzie.

203
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,132

204
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,215

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,846
- Oh. What the jangle?

206
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:18,127
Is this what I think it is?

207
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,440
- Hundo P, grade A,
beat-beat ninjawa bracelet.

208
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,930
- A thousand generations of CHAI's live on

209
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,490
within that bracelet.

210
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,610
- My mumzies gave it to
me when I was of age-ies

211
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,660
and now I gives it to youse.

212
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,493
- For Reals?

213
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:36,359
Can I try it on?

214
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,223
- Yeah. I mean, that's the idea, right?

215
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,590
(music gets all magical AF)

216
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:51,343
- Can I have a mummy-do with little CHAI?

217
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,410
- Yeah, of course.

218
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,015
- Some Sheila's were very special

219
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:05,043
back in the wastes, CHAI-TRO.

220
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,570
When they came of ageies,

221
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,240
they were touched by RENINJ

222
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,153
and they became ninjawas.

223
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:16,330
- Ninja what-a-s?

224
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,330
- Ninjawas, they were my peeps.

225
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,436
And yours too.

226
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:23,117
- Oh yeah, I 'member?

227
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:24,840
Wasn't you they queen?

228
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,010
- Yas.

229
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,000
But thanks to your Papa-do,

230
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,547
we found our homezies

231
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:31,735
and we became one with the FP.

232
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:33,460
- That's so fucking tight.

233
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,680
- Watch your mouth.

234
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,833
- Sorry MUM-CHAI.

235
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,240
I just wish I could do something tight,

236
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
like you and daddy-do.

237
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,073
- You will.

238
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,790
On a ninjawas 18th BD.

239
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,513
She becomes a warrior

240
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:52,081
and her Beat-Beat training begins.

241
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,649
- For reals?

242
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:56,481
- For reals, H-B-D my CHAI-TRO.

243
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,432

244
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:00,423

The mostest.

246
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:12,007
- Oh, Training? For beat-beat?

247
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,330
How about butt-butt?

248
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,600
Kiss my butt-butt, you fuckers.

249
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,447
I should be running this God damn town.

250
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:21,947
- (trip serious electronic music)

251
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,058
- Yo JTRO. It's time.

252
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:31,493
- I know.

253
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,613
- What's the haps?

254
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:39,698
- There's somethin' we got to show you.

255
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,608
- What sorta somethin'.

256
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:45,575
(music implies serious shit is comin')

257
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,448
(thunder roaring)

258
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:54,074
- I thought y'all closed the mines,

259
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:55,963
'cause the FP went green.

260
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:57,629
- Nah, he closed the mines

261
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:59,712
after we found this shit.

262
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:06,806
(big ass epic sci-fi reveal swell)

263
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:10,752
- What the H E dubba L?

264
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,720
- The ancients called
it the remix revelation.

265
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,410
It came to our world a
whole bunch of 365s ago.

266
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,121
- You can read all that shit?

267
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,360
- I speak quack Baby-TRO.

268
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,376
BFD

269
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,362
- All right.

270
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,963
The remix revelation brought

271
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:30,310
Beat-Beat to our world

272
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,913
and started all them beat-wars.

273
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,860
After all that bull ended,

274
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,103
this shit got lost A-F to legend.

275
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,993
Until now.

276
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:43,600
- Yeah, yeah.

277
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,853
I heard all about them beat-wars before.

278
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,860
Some ancient civilization

279
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,029
from the way backs, that got lost to time,

280
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,004

What does this thing do, hey?

286
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,875
(explosion)

287
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,365

(beat-off alarm sounding)

301
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,678
- Awe, give me a minute.

302
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:51,186
That was my first time
getting launched out

303
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:52,720
of a fucking beat-cannon.

304
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,520
Awh, my back.

305
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,750

306
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,460
- Wait, what?

307
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,316
Dad, why the fuck are you calling me dad?

308
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:06,432
- Are you going deaf or something?

309
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:07,482
You heard me.

310
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,854
It's me, your effin' daughter.

311
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:11,273
- What the fuck?

312
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:13,120
- I know, what the fuck?

313
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,070

314
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,712
How old are you?

315
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:19,218
- Eighteen and change.

316
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,738

- Eighteen and a bunch of change.

320
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,930
- It aint about how much change you got,

321
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,277
it's about how you spend it.

322
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:32,150
- Okay, look, I can't
even with you, right now.

323
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,156
You were a baby two days ago.

324
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:37,120

- I don't know.

339
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,423
- Oh, this is just perfect.

340
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:03,233
Figuring out time travel, really
isn't something I wanted to

341
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,380

342
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,898
Wait a second.

00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:10,271
I recognize that bracelet.

344
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,830

(undrunks roaring with thirst)

371
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:06,383
- What the cone-head?

372
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:08,821
- We have to skip-o, now.

373
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:12,050
(undrunks roaring with thirst)

374
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,095
- Look, we'll explain on the way.

375
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:14,928
Let's go.

376
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:18,326

across the wastes

385
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,308
cash in on captured beat-beaters

386
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:43,897
and toss them over to

387
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:48,314

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,141
and win their mo' suckin' freedum?

394
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:05,280
Who it gonna be tonight?

The CHAI-TROS vs. AK-47

396
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:10,390
and the bro-bot of legend,

397
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,890
himself with a cracking new rig,

398
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,639
L Dubba E.

399
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:18,160
- Yo! Check this shit out, Dr. Bitch!

400
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,836
- Let's go fucking L I V.

401
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:23,919
(classic running away music)

402
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:28,713
(for real ass storm noises)

403
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:30,057
- What the hell are we out here

404
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:31,543
doing all this for?

405
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,376
- I don't know.

406
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:33,570
Ask your mum.

407
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,236
She's the one that thought
getting tossed in here

408
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,180
with a bunch of Beat-Beat bounty hunters

409
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,230
was such a great idea.

410
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,840
- Oh excuse me.

411
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,360
L Dubba E's just trying to
raise the beat-beat god,

412
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,797
who wants to 1-8-7 Earf
and start round two of

413
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,797
The beat-wars.

414
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:45,796
- Yeah, trying.

415
00:23:45,796 --> 00:23:46,760
How about we wait until he actually

416
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,200
fucking does something, first?

417
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
- Unlike you, when shit gets hot,

418
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,790
I don't wait for it get hotter.

419
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,081
- Jesus, come on.

420
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:56,742
- Yo Rents! Fuckin' Refresh-ify,
we've got bigger probs.

421
00:23:56,742 --> 00:23:58,822
(undrunks roaring with thirst)

422
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:00,403
- (both together) Watch you mouth.

423
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:02,082
- They look hungry.

424
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:03,464
- They're not hungry, they're thirsty.

425
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:04,520
- What?

426
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,353
- Nevermind.

427
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:06,186
Doesn't matter.

428
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,619
- We're almost at the first barrier.

429
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,490
(storm noises gettin' serious)

430
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,476
Time to turn on the gas.

431
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:15,271
- My gas is turned on.

432
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:16,504
What the F?

433
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:17,887
- Look, your mum's in a mood right now.

434
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:18,720
Okay.

435
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,561
Just jump on.

436
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:20,410
- What?

437
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,243
- Just jump on my God damn back,

438
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:23,176
so we can outrun these fuckers
in the booze storm. Okay?

439
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:24,134
- Oh fuck!

440
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:26,817
- Yeah, oh fuck, now get on, now.

441
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:29,749
- Hold your breath, we're going in.

442
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:32,329
(big storm whoosh energy)

443
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,813
("we can do it" action music)

444
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:35,879
- We're not gonna make it.

445
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,629
- We're gonna make it.

446
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,462
- We're not gonna make it.

447
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,838
- We'll you're not gonna
make it, unless you zip it

448
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:44,751
and hold your God damn breath, young lady.

449
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,047
Hold on.

450
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:48,880
(music intensifies vibe
that "we can do it")

451
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,347
(undrunks roaring with thirst)

452
00:24:56,754 --> 00:24:59,671
(music triumphantly lets
us know "we did it")

453
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,410
- Did we lose them?

454
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,440
- Yeah, for now.

455
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,820
- Obviously you ain't taking this,

456
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,210
saving the world shit as hundo-P as me.

457
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,900
- Oh, I'm taking it hundo-P,

458
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,760
but I'm also taking,

459
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
saving our time-traveling daughter's life,

460
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,610
pretty seriously too.

461
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,930
I've got a lot of shit
on my plate, right now.

462
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,040
- Well, if that was our daughter

463
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,730
she wouldn't need saving.

464
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,740
She'd be a CHAI.

465
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,763
- Okay, here we go.

466
00:25:22,658 --> 00:25:23,970
- Yeah, here we go.

467
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,900
It's my fucking 18th Bday

468
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,730
and you twos just tossed me through time

469
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,420
and did fuck-all to prepare me

470
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,563
for any of this shit.

471
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,660
- Wait, today's your 18th bday?

472
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,493
- Duh.

473
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,033
- Come on CHAI

474
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,560
She's got your mum's bracelet.

475
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,483
She looks just like you, do the math.

476
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,793
- Fine,

477
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:55,004
H-B-D my CHAI-TRO.

478
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,300
But youse a Sheila, now.

479
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,900
It's time to calm those
chin waggy chin chats.

480
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,433
And we're going to get you,

481
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:07,935
some beat-weppies.

482
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:12,509
- [ Game Announcer] Wow. Beat-Knucks.

483
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:13,342
- Wow!

484
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:14,308
What are these?

485
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,884
- Beat-knucks.

486
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:16,740
- Huh?

487
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,550
- First time out of the FP, huh?

488
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,830
- You know poten-ch?

489
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,190
- Well beat-offs come in all sorts

490
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,120
of different flavors out here.

491
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,633
- I know this might be a bit cringe but,

492
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,923
I don't know how to use any of these.

493
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,739
- Something tells me,

494
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,976
you're about to find out pretty fast.

495
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:38,134
(undrunks roar with thirst)

496
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,480
- We best beat-feet.

497
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,623
We're falling behind.

498
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:45,473
- Mum's the boss.

499
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,133
Let's roll.

500
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,875
(tracker beeping)

501
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,290
- JTRO and crew just rolled
past the red barrier. Ha!

502
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,690
- I don't give a fuck.

503
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,160
Well, that's gonna complicate shit.

504
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:14,380
- Maybe if I was a bitch, you
calling my ass a bitch, bitch?

505
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,850
- No.

506
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,370
- Yo don't be salt talkin' my ass, buster.

507
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,112
Y'all wanna enter the drop zone again.

508
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:21,818
I'm fucking right here, homie.

509
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:23,650
It's all day. Eryday!

510
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,483
- No.

511
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:25,316
That's not what I'm saying.

512
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:26,554
All I'm trying to say is,

513
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:29,295
if we wanna roll out now is the time

514
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:32,422
because the people who are
trying to stop our asses

515
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:34,130
are basically here.

516
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,010
- Y'all wanna take back the a FP

517
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,140
or get your ass 1-8-7'd,
like last time, huh?!

518
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,960
- Well, as I remember you
didn't fare well either.

519
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,085
- Booshit.

520
00:27:44,085 --> 00:27:45,250
Who found your ass out here?

521
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,711
Dusted that shit off and
got you back in the ring?

522
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:49,961
Ninja? Me, my ass.

523
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:51,950
Now I'm taking charge, homeboy.

524
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,200
- If you're so tough.

525
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,060
Why did it take you so
long to take back the FP?

526
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,050
- Shit, I got bigger ducks to fry, honky.

527
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,133
Just sit back and watch the show, Q-tip.

528
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,673
Chop, chop doctor bitch.

529
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:09,970
(bad guy music rises the tension)

530
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,180
(dope ass level select music returns)

531
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,466
- If you're both here,

532
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:37,606
who the F-U-K is watching
little me back home?

533
00:28:37,606 --> 00:28:39,860
- Your babysitter, Uncle DC.

534
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,059
- Wait, you mean all them times,

535
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,669
you had me chill with Uncle DC,

536
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:44,877
when I was little me,

537
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:46,858
you were off doing cool shit, like this?

538
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,480
- I don't know, this is the first time

539
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,580
we've left little you with him.

540
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,810
- Okay, you both need to
zippy dip it, right now.

541
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,350
We've got bigger ducks to pluck.

542
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,515
- Does we?

543
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:59,432
(scurry ass monster noise)

544
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,943
Prepare to beat-off.

545
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,240
(undrunks screaming)

546
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,450
- They're coming.

547
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,089
- What's coming?

548
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:12,083

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,363
to the duck peeps of Earf.

674
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,630
Allowing him to do

675
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,203
what he did to so many worlds before.

676
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,790
Hook the peeps on the Quatro

677
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,310
until they couldn't live withouts it.

678
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,489
Enslaving them with the fear of getting

679
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:30,378
flipped straight edge again,

680
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,087

these ducks could sort
their shit out no longer.

682
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,273
And they would become undrunk.

683
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:43,390
The Beat-Massa descended upon them

684
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,360
with his unstoppable army of L Black Ds

685
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,750
and 1-8-7'd the known duck world,

686
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,577
in what we now know as the Beat-Wars.

687
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:56,867
(fuck this music just got sik)

688
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,210
And when the land was sucked dry,

of all her fossil boozes,

690
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,973
the Beat-Massa began the cycle anew.

691
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,360
The wet shit swept across the land.

692
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,750
1-8-7'ing and all the peeps.

693
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,630
But 9-1-1-ing Mother Earf,

694
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,420
bringing them fossil boozes back

695
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,793

696
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:26,793

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,900
- All right, so like way TLDR.

698
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,160
But what's important, right now,

699
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,090
is that we need to stop L Dubba E

700
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,160
before we wakes that
B-M-X son of a bitch up

701
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,321
and starts this cycle all over again.

702
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,154
- Hold up.

703
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,640
How can L Dubba E do all this shit?

704
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,060
Wasn't he just some broke
ass busta from the FP?

705
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,893
- Look CHAI-TRO,

706
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:46,360
L Dub is a left over
weapon from the Beat-Wars.

707
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,460
He is the last of the L Black Ds

708
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,420
and it is up to us to stop him,

709
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,991
before he can start this
shit all over again.

710
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:55,367

I present you with CHAI-T and fam.

732
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,542
Yeah.

733
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,760
- Jesus.

734
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,833
- Resume chorezes Z2

735
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,651
- Fucking wake up.

736
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:51,484
Got to work

737
00:37:51,484 --> 00:37:52,506
Go to bed

738
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:56,570
- Yousse is NITRO's youngling, yes?

739
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,975
He was our guestie once.

740
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:01,513
As youse is now.

741
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,868
- Far out.

742
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:08,868
- You are looking to D-U-N
this ancient ass evil?

743
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:14,092
This L-E-E of the L black D's,

744
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:17,220
but in order to reach his ass,

745
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,855
y'allz must voyage deep into the purple

746
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:23,827
and upon his 1-8-7.

747
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:27,410
Y'allz will roll up
upon the Comet Of Dawn,

748
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:32,132
and pray to him for escape from Bako.

749
00:38:32,132 --> 00:38:33,342
- Cool.

750
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:35,533
- Now open your drums.

751
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:39,150
'Cause I gots a request of y'allz.

752
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,983
The use of the forbidden fossil boozies

753
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:45,741
from the twinkies must end.

754
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,950
- Respect. But what the hell

755
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,744
do you want us to do about it?

756
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:54,073
- The Comet Of Dawn is
poisoning our Earf Mama.

757
00:38:54,073 --> 00:38:56,890
You must finally D-U-N the comet,

758
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,968
once and forevz.

759
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:01,290
- How?

760
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,887
- We will 1-8-7 Dawn

761
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:07,291
and help bring balance back to the wastes.

762
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:10,957
- Many thanks CHAI-T, my old friendy-do

763
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:14,860
allow us some H-R-S's to prepare

764
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,535
Y'allz's transport into the purple.

765
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:20,287
- Many thanks Farm Massa.

766
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,780
Need to have some meditates

767
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,950
and sort some shit out.

768
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,943
You stay close and be ready.

769
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:35,740
(thunder rumbling)

770
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,550
- You wanna go get a drink or what?

771
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:44,299
- Lates.

772
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:50,294
(rockin' bad guy music)

773
00:39:52,364 --> 00:39:55,614
(lightening crackling)

774
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,765
(beat-pod engine revs)

775
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,951
(bro-bot hydraulics)

776
00:40:04,951 --> 00:40:07,042
(beat-beat arrows bopping)

777
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:15,689
(intense beat-beat)

778
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:17,923
- Can't see shit in this storm.

779
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:19,089
- Get used to it, homie.

780
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:21,069
I'm gonna spread this darkness worldwide.

781
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:22,040
For my Massa.

782
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,990
- What?

783
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,233
- It's how my peeps do.

784
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:26,631
Bro-bot shit. My Massa
made me in his image.

785
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:29,530
During them Beat-Wars, dumb shit.

786
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,830
- I got priors.

787
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,770
- L-E-A, L-E-B, L-E-C.

788
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,260
Do the math sucka.

789
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,100
- L-E-D?

790
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,472
- Shit, that nothin' ass use-ta?

791
00:40:38,472 --> 00:40:40,750
He use-ta to run Dawn's Liquor, in the FP.

792
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,574
He use-ta to run all kinds
of shit. Like his cock sucka.

793
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:45,707
- And what happened to him?

794
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:46,790
- ME, motha fucka!

795
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,733
My ass!

796
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,458
Y'all keep beatin' it, homie.

797
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,433
(bad guy music gets double serious)

798
00:40:55,637 --> 00:40:57,787
(beat-beat intensifies)

799
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:07,180
(mystical contemplation music)

800
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,870
- [CHAI-TRO] Not bad, hey.

801
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:12,282
- [JTRO] Yeah. You can't really
tell the difference, huh.

802
00:41:12,282 --> 00:41:15,056
- [CHAI-TRO] What up
with you and MUMMY-CHAI?

803
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,560
- [JTRO] What do you mean?

804
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,083
- She's all P-Oed A-F, what'd you do?

805
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,353
- That's adult shit.

806
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:25,039
- Mmmmm. I'm 18 and I've
remixed through time,

807
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,636
I adult AF.

808
00:41:27,537 --> 00:41:30,004
- Did I ever tell you about your birth?

809
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:33,185
Like, you know, the future me?

810
00:41:33,185 --> 00:41:34,018
- Nah.

811
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:36,966
- Well,

812
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:42,582
When you were born, it wasn't just you.

813
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:45,519
You had a brother, CHAI-TRO.

814
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,436
- Twinsies?

815
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,170
- Yeah, kinda.

816
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:54,170
Um, you know due to
some health politics he,

817
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:55,723
Yeah, he didn't make it.

818
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,150
Ever since then, uh,

819
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,523
you know your mum and I hasn't
really been quite the same.

820
00:42:03,425 --> 00:42:06,534
You know, she's strong, she got over it.

821
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:09,782
I dunno,  I guess, I just,
never really knew how.

822
00:42:09,782 --> 00:42:10,615
And uh,

823
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,140
you know, she's a CHAI,

824
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,900
and they don't really
care much about boys so.

825
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:21,093
You know, I probably said some shit.

826
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,230
Probably didn't handle things

827
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,390
as well as I probably could have.

828
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:30,816
I guess now she's pissed off at me because

829
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:35,731
She thinks that, all I care
about, is about somebody

830
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:37,906
who's already gone.

831
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:39,683
And not about her, who's still here.

832
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,068
- Did you ever tell her any of this shit?

833
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:45,540
- Yeah, I mean I tried.

834
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,877
She's like some fuckin' magical being,

835
00:42:47,877 --> 00:42:49,861
okay, I'm just some dude from the FP.

836
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:50,894
I mean what am I supposed to say?

837
00:42:50,894 --> 00:42:52,897
I don't know what's going on in her head.

838
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:55,097
- All right, rewind.

839
00:42:55,097 --> 00:42:56,700
Take two, yo.

840
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,760
When's the last time

841
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,096
you told her you L-U-V'd her?

842
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,623
Caring silently doesn't mean shit, dad.

843
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,710
I don't care how much booshit,

844
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,810
you got goin' on.

845
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,230
We all does.

846
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,012
But if you don't tell peeps you care,

847
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:13,845
they assume you don't.

848
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:16,570
- Who told you that?

849
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,403
- You did.

850
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,063
- How were your mom and I in the future?

851
00:43:23,063 --> 00:43:24,979
- Factor fifty.

852
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:29,638
To power these beat-poddies,

853
00:43:29,638 --> 00:43:31,570
you gotta be able to beat-beat, right?

854
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,120
- Yeah, I mean that's generally

855
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,700
how things work out here.

856
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,530
- You've never even let me beat-off

857
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,773
before in my time.

858
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,130
I don't even know how.

859
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:41,963
- Really?

860
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,220
- Maybe we never taught you

861
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,130
how to beat-off and your time because...

862
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,467
- We already did.

863
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,660
We knew, that in order to save the world,

864
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,860
things had to happen,
exactly as they once did.

865
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,680
- And how do we know that?

866
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,709
- I lits just thought of it.

867
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:06,030
But we have to Omega enforce it,

868
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,123
from here on out.

869
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,830
- So is beat-pod ready, then?

870
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,943
- Ready, steady and burning hot.

871
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:18,023
- All right.

872
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:19,303
Let's go to work.

873
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:23,753
(bomb electronic music swells)

874
00:44:28,454 --> 00:44:31,420
(guitar synth music up in here)

00:44:33,513 --> 00:44:35,200

(beat-computer beeping)

878
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,911
- [CHAI-TRO What do I do, first?

879
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:44,880
- [JTRO] You just hop on.

880
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,988
- [CHAI-TRO] That's it?

881
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:47,200
- That's how I learned.

882
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:51,599
(beat-computer beeping)

883
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,657
- [Game Announcer] Beat-Pod coordinates.

884

Coordinating.

885
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:56,092
Coordinated.

886
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:58,850
- There's a lot of ancient
CHAI-blood in you CHAI-TRO.

887
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,463
From both our sides.

888
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,623
Y'all ready for this?

889
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,275
Let's beat first and think later.

890
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:11,079
- [Game Announcer ] Three.

891
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,053
Two.

892
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:14,282
One.

893
00:45:14,282 --> 00:45:15,732
Beat-Beat.

894
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:20,890
(beat-pod engines ignites)

00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,256
(incoming creep mode alarm)

896
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:26,114
- Somethin's comin' up fast.

897
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:27,647
Double fast.

898
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:29,181
(incoming creep mode alarm)

899
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:30,804
- White Chocolate.

900
00:45:30,804 --> 00:45:31,738
- What do we do?

901
00:45:31,738 --> 00:45:33,653
- Yo! Stop slow riding, like a bitch.

902
00:45:33,653 --> 00:45:35,830
Move this bolt bucket, cracka.

903
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,370
- It's a little tough to
do all this by myself.

904
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,120
There's two pads for a reason.

905
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,953
- Fuck it!

906
00:45:40,953 --> 00:45:42,552
Take the wheel, cranberry juice.

907
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:43,385
Let me show you

908
00:45:43,385 --> 00:45:45,336
how a mo-suckin' stallion gets this done.

909
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:49,889
- Okay.

910
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,250
- Franken-ninja up in here.

911
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,654
Yo, hot potato.

915
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,720
Round three.

916
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,733
Finally, some fuckin' beat-pods.

917
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,570
Contesties must race their way through

918
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,697
the never-ending storm of
twisted booze mountains

919
00:46:15,697 --> 00:46:17,393
towards the final goal

920
00:46:17,393 --> 00:46:19,200
at the home of the Comment Of Dawn,

921
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,772
The Quatro-cano.

922
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:22,910
- It's been a long time

923
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,839
since we seen a round three, Jim.

924
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:27,027
Ole NITRO was the last beater we saw

925
00:46:27,027 --> 00:46:28,840
with that kind of gas, Tom?

926
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,467
- Yeah, fuck it, I'm here for
it. Fuck it, I'm here for it!

927
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:36,409
(dope level select music)

928
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,427
(typical beat-pod chase music)

929
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,670
- Yo, tippy toes.

930
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,604
This is how a real ninja beat-off.

931
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:06,001

940
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:36,704

943
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,410
- Yo, Panduh Express! Take a left.

944
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,590
- What through the canyon?

945
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:52,910
- It's a short cut.

946
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,499
- Yeah, a shortcut to
gettin' fuckin' Green-lit.

947
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,565

00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:14,299
- [Game Announcer] Target escaping.

952
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:15,658
More gassies.

953
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:17,079
- We need more gassies.

954
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:18,204
Beat them feet.

955
00:48:18,204 --> 00:48:20,316
- All right, CHAI-TRO dance with your mind

956
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:21,430
not your feet.

957
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,408
Do you understand me?

958
00:48:22,408 --> 00:48:23,903
- What the fuck does that mean?

959
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:25,232
- Anticipate what's coming.

960
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:27,130
Look forward, not back.

961
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,731
If you spend your whole
life looking at yesterday,

962
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,800
you're never gonna have a tomorrow.

963
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,419
Yesterday is a 1-8-7.

964
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:34,539
Tomorrow is where winning is dun.

965
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:36,483
D-U-N.

966
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:38,247
I used to be mad about everything,

967
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:40,755
about what I've lost and
how I've been wronged.

968
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:44,455
But if I never lost BTRO or B-L-T,

969
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,548
I never would have met your mother,

970
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,998
and I would of never had you.

971
00:48:53,582 --> 00:48:54,750
Everything happens

972
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,810
how its supposed to happen, CHAI-TRO.

973
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,148
Sometimes if life takes a shit on you,

974
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:01,080
you just gotta wait for it to wipe its ass

975
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,670
and flush first before you give up on it.

976
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,872
You dig?

977
00:49:03,872 --> 00:49:04,742
- I dig.

978
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:05,575
I'm digging.

(Beat-Pods revving)

981
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,560
- We can't change the past,

982
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,150
But we can always change tomorrow.

983
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,100
CHAI-TRO. Don't run from the past.

984
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,040
Learn from it.

985
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,444
Use it's ass.

986
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,623
You got this.

987
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,430
You take everything,

988
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,160
one beat at a time, CHAI-TRO.

989
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,670
Nothing past that matters.

990
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,154
Do not fear the pads.

991
00:49:35,154 --> 00:49:37,703
You make the pads fear you.

992
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:45,827
(beat-pods revving)

993
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,194
- [Game Announcer] Queen killer.

994
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,552
Whoa! She-RO Mode!

995

Incoming Four-way stop.

996
00:49:54,713 --> 00:49:55,813
- Low bridge.

997
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:57,580
- What the fuck does that mean?

998
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,963
- Beat down.

999
00:50:00,817 --> 00:50:03,900
(beat-pads beatin'-off like mad)

1000
00:50:06,001 --> 00:50:07,133
Down Ninj!

1001
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:08,508
Down Ninj!

1002
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,090
Creepers still be creeping.

1003
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:13,130
- So that did nothing.

1004
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,420
You got anymore bright
ideas back there, pal?

1005
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,773

- High bridge.

1009
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:32,910

00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,820
with you and bridges all of a sudden, huh?

1011
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,733
Does that mean up?

1012
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:36,566
- Duh.

1013
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,426
- DUH!

(beat-pod breaking the sound barrier)

1016
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:58,695
- [Game Announcer] Yo! Speed up, chumps.

1017
00:50:58,695 --> 00:51:01,996
- So, yeah, none of this is working.

1018
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:03,308
Yo, what are you doing?

1019
00:51:03,308 --> 00:51:05,033

I am not a happy chappy.

1032

This one's on me.

1039
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,460
- You don't have to do this alone.

1040
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,293
- I'm not alone.

1041
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,380
We're a team, right?

1042
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,310
Different team members
have different skills.

1043
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,123
You're the brains, and I'm the noise.

1044

Take a look around, homeboy.

1068

00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,210
You think this mother fucker is gonna

1092
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,723
live up to anything he says?

1093
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,473
What's he even promising you?

1094
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,167
He's in this for himself, that's it.

1095
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:57,373
And you fucking know it.

1096
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,321
Look, I'm sorry dude,

1097
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:03,433
but you do not have to do this.

1098
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,963
The FP doesn't have to
be my town or your town.

1099
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,232
We're fucking adults, now.

1100
00:56:11,232 --> 00:56:12,800
It can be our town, God damn it.

1101
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,940
(Emotionally persuasive music)

1102
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,060
You don't have to be some
lonely sand-ninj out here,

1103
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,230
just huffin' to do God
knows what to survive.

1104
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,440
You can come back.

1105
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,470
You have a home.

1106
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,553
You have a family.

1107
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,540
- This is some dumb ass shit.

1108
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,700
Y'all listen to yourselves.

1109
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,930
- That mother fucker, killed our brother.

1110
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,113
- I don't give a fuck.

1111
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,610
- He'll kill you,

1112
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:35,560
he'll kill everyone

1113
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,610
if we don't stop him.

1114
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,173
Come on ATRO.

1115
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,880
- Hermanos?

1116
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,880
- Just a couple of assholes

1117
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,350
who look like each other.

1118
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:52,618
(L Dubba E chanting)

1119
00:56:57,172 --> 00:57:00,371
- Hot potato, bitch.

1120
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:03,638
- [Game Announcer] Eight way stop.

1121
00:57:06,271 --> 00:57:09,133
- Eeny, meeny, miny, ho,

1123
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:14,324
my dick told me

1124
00:57:14,324 --> 00:57:17,883
to pick the very choice one and,

1125
00:57:19,432 --> 00:57:21,740
open wide cranberry juice.

1126
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:26,111
Time to suck my brick mother fuck-

1127
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:29,063
- [Game Announcer] Nut buster!

1128
00:57:29,063 --> 00:57:31,173
(L Dubba E screaming)

1129
00:57:31,173 --> 00:57:32,758
- This is where you fall down.

1130
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,528
Some mother fuckers are always trying

1131
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:43,004
to Beat-Beat up hill.

1132
00:57:43,004 --> 00:57:45,287
(L Dubba E screaming like a chump)

1133
00:57:47,055 --> 00:57:49,388
(explosion - DUH)

1134
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:04,580
- Holy shit.

1135
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,755
- Yeah, that's honestly

1136
00:58:05,755 --> 00:58:07,514
not how I thought that
was gonna go at all.

1137
00:58:07,514 --> 00:58:09,023
Awh fuck, I'll take it.

1138
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,800
- Dadzies!

1139
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,810
Uncle-ATRO?

1140
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:15,860
What the Unc is you doing here?

1141
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,800
- Am I supposed to know who this kid is?

1142
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,570
- Yeah, that's uh, that's your niece.

1143
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,322
- Oh. Hola

1144
00:58:21,322 --> 00:58:22,785
- Uh its YOLA

1145
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,253
- Where's L Dub?

1146
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,780
- No body, no trial.

1147
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,890
- Is it done?

1148
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:29,800
Did we winsies?

1149
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:34,670
(mysterious music mystifies)

1150
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,775
- It's up to you now, CHAI-TRO.

1151
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:50,378
You have to finish this.

1152
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:53,190
- Mom?

1153
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,140
- It'll be chill.

1154
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,012
A great power brews within you,

1155
00:58:58,012 --> 00:59:00,046
from the blood of our ancients.

1156
00:59:00,046 --> 00:59:02,690
Only you can 1-8-7 the comet.

1157
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,240
It's what our ancesties did,

1158
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,485
to free worlds.

1159
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:08,723
Back when we came from the twinkies.

1160
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,693
- Dad?

1161
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,820
- It's like ridin' a bike.

1162
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,803
- I L-U-V youse.

1163
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,811
- We L-U-V youse.

1164
00:59:24,584 --> 00:59:25,667
The mostest.

1165
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:29,578
- HBD kiddo.

1166
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:33,526
- Lates rents.

1167
00:59:39,386 --> 00:59:40,871
- Lates yo.

1168
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:42,168
- Nice meeting you.

1169
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,292
- Some Sheilas were very special

1170
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:50,666
back in the wastes CHAI-TRO.

1171
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,983
When they came of ageies,

1172
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,505
they were touched by RENINJ,

1173
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:01,525
And they became ninjawas.

1174
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,027
A thousand generations of CHAIs live on

1175
01:00:07,027 --> 01:00:07,880
in that bracelet.

1176
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,223
- Just wish I could do something tight,

1177
01:00:12,223 --> 01:00:14,008
Like you and daddy do.

1178
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:14,841
- You will.

1179
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:20,633
On a ninjawa's 18th BD,
she becomes a warrior.

1180
01:00:25,631 --> 01:00:29,623
And her Beat-Beat training begins.

1181
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:34,206
(unexplainable magic shit intensifies)

1182
01:00:43,534 --> 01:00:45,734
(time fast forward)

1183
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:50,430
(Remix Revelation cools down)

1184
01:00:52,871 --> 01:00:56,429
(music is all mysterious 'n shit)

1185
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:04,073
- Oh thank RENINJ.

1186
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:06,580
- We never knew if we'd see you again,

1187
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,725
after we sent you through the remix.

1188
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:11,197
- I told you, what happ'd, happ'd.

1189
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:13,473
You can't change the past.

1190
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:15,043
- But we can change tomorrow.

1191
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:18,810
- What is the actual F-U-K
are you guys rappin' about?

1192
01:01:19,644 --> 01:01:21,225
- Are you ready?

1193
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:24,667
- For what?

1194
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,400
(ominous music implies
shit's about to get ill)

1195
01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:38,768
(thunder roaring)

1196
01:01:49,545 --> 01:01:52,067
- The wet shit comes in every awakening.

1197
01:01:52,067 --> 01:01:53,170
- Rewind.

1198
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,858
What's awakening?

1199
01:01:54,858 --> 01:01:57,775
(thunder crashing)

1200
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,363
- Beat-Massa X.

1201
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,904
- The final battle for earf has begun, yo.

1202
01:02:05,904 --> 01:02:08,694
(thunder crashing)

1203
01:02:08,694 --> 01:02:11,143
- Jesus laweez-Us.

1204
01:02:11,143 --> 01:02:14,445
(thunder crashing)

1205
01:02:17,345 --> 01:02:21,762
(intense imminent cliffhanger music)

1206
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:59,084
(End credits banger vaguely
hinting at the plot of FP4)

1207
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:04,915
(PS - Keep watching
until after the credits)

1208
01:08:12,493 --> 01:08:16,550
(Oh shit there's another scene?!)

1209
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,908
(Spooky bad guy music 'n shit)

1210
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:35,096
- Yo.

1211
01:08:35,096 --> 01:08:38,212
Let's finish what you started, pops.

1212
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:42,652
Quack!

1213
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,646
(BOOM Yo!)
