And at the end of the day,

186
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,126
revenge emerged victorious.

187
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:20,114
Hey, asshole.

188
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:27,856
Gun down! Freeze!

189
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:31,159
Blaire: drop the gun, keller.

190
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:35,964
What the hell have you done?

191
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:40,902
Order! Order in the court!

192
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:48,910
This court finds you
guilty, john keller,

193
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:52,514
for the aggravated and
unprovoked murders

194
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:56,150
of 2 law enforcement officers.

195
00:16:56,184 --> 00:17:01,956
I'm recommending a life-term
sentence without parole.

196
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,492
You'll be remanded

197
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,160
to the
maximum-security penitentiary,

198
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:07,696
fuego penal.

199
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,871
John keller... a decorated
s.w.a.t. officer for this city,

200
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,807
now a convicted murderer...

201
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,743
is to serve out the rest
of his life in prison.

202
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:22,944
An isolated tragedy

203
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:26,681
or an early warning to
high-stress law enforcement agencies

204
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,883
that other such incidents are...

205
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:29,984
th-there he is!

206
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:30,852
Mr. Keller!

207
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:33,054
Do you feel like you
got a fair trial?

208
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:37,792
Keller, do you feel the
sentence was fair?

209
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,127
Right here, sir.

210
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:01,155
Preston here.

211
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:03,585
Man on telephone:
he's heading your way.

212
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:07,889
Uh, yes, i... i just read the paper.

213
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,123
What do we know about him?

214
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:12,827
My sources tell
me keller's case is legit.

215
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:15,564
Don't screw this up.

216
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,032
My bet?

217
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,203
He's dead by morning.

218
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:25,640
Keller is one of the
world's greatest fighters.

219
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:27,141
He is rare.

220
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:29,544
I want him.

221
00:18:29,578 --> 00:18:31,846
Well, i... [dial tone]

222
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,828
welcome to my universe.

223
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:23,997
[Click]

224
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,199
[click]

225
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:43,084
welcome, gentlemen, to fuego penal,

226
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:44,819
a place where you will live out

227
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:47,889
your miserable, worthless
existences indefinitely.

228
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:51,025
I'm files. Think of me as god.

229
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,696
Screw with me, and by
sweet, sunny jesus,

230
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:55,964
i will use your prostates

231
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,266
as goddamn trampolines.

232
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,735
Preston: hello, girls.

233
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:03,271
I'm the warden.

234
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:06,007
I have one rule in my prison.

235
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:15,717
There are no rules.

236
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,214
Move it, keller.

237
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:49,150
Inmate: john matthew keller,

238
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:51,986
hero of the people.

239
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,054
Holy shit.

240
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,356
Sound like you know the
man, winston.

241
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:57,258
Only what i read on the net.

242
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:01,963
Hey, billings,

243
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,798
wasn't keller the guy who nailed you

244
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,767
for armed robbery a few years back?

245
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Yeah.

246
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,137
* And now i know

247
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,405
* there's a living god *

248
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,308
praise jesus.

249
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:17,011
Keller has been delivered to me.

250
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:35,495
Howdy.

251
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:38,066
Name's winston,
as in churchill.

252
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,236
Man with a marvelousth rift
of language.

253
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,270
I like that.

254
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,038
Yes, i do, indeed.

255
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:46,407
Shows character,
shows innate wisdom.

256
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,143
Shows, um... shut up.

257
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:50,979
Shows shut up. I can do that.

258
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:57,485
Hey, listen, i'm a guy that
you need to know and like.

259
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:58,820
Why?

260
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:00,488
I get things for people:

261
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,390
drugs, cigarettes,
good book,

262
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:04,391
even women.

263
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:06,494
I got contacts.

264
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,510
Well, just thought you'd
like to know.

265
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,068
Hey, officer keller,

266
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,971
meet the famous dr. Rosenbloom.

267
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:19,207
Killed his father and
mother with a corkscrew.

268
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,480
But don't hold that against him.

269
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,844
Deep down, he's a real sweetheart.

270
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,378
John keller.

271
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:26,747
You look much larger on television.

272
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:32,253
The first one... is free.

273
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:35,156
It's for all the pain.

274
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:37,391
Don't look now, keller,

275
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:38,893
there's a couple of good old boys

276
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,895
coming your way with orders to kill.

277
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:44,899
How do you know?

278
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:46,767
Got contacts, like i said.

279
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:50,038
I just did you a favor...

280
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,071
you owe me one.

281
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:16,297
Well...

282
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,067
our new playboy is
definitely a player.

283
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:26,807
Heh.

284
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,039
Did he... disappoint?

285
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:01,142
Absolutely not, sir.

286
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:04,578
I saw him fight once.

287
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:07,515
He was masterful.

288
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:11,185
However...

289
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:15,489
we don't want to move too quickly,

290
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:18,893
after the schrek incident.

291
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:21,462
We'll keep it simple, mr. Caesar.

292
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:25,033
Conventional indoctrination,
as per policy.

293
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,969
One last thing, warden.

294
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,470
About schrek...

295
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:34,008
how did things go so wrong?

296
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:38,212
U-uh... bad luck, sir.

297
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:42,116
The transport that was
moving schrek blew a tire.

298
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,952
Schrek acted quickly,

299
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,086
killed the guards,

300
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,055
escaped within minutes.

301
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,627
It garneredunnecessary attention.

302
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:55,663
S-s-s-such an incident

303
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,265
will not happen again, sir.

304
00:24:57,298 --> 00:24:59,000
Good.

305
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:03,004
Keep me apprised on
keller's progress.

306
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:28,997
Files...

307
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:33,334
bring in our new guest.

308
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,604
[Shackles clanking]

309
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:44,278
mr. Keller.

310
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,215
Very impressive performance

311
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:48,516
in the kitchen this morning.

312
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,085
I was told they were
ordered to kill me.

313
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,119
Who told you that?

314
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,557
Heh heh.

315
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,327
In any case, it's probably true.

316
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,130
You're an ex-cop, mr. Keller.

317
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:04,065
Not a lot of people around here

318
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:07,268
have warm, fuzzy feelings for you.

319
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:10,738
However, i could
make your stay

320
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:12,773
a little more tolerable.

321
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,342
Interested?

322
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,178
If it allows me to pursue a life

323
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:19,080
of religious and
spiritual fulfilment,

324
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:20,113
of course.

325
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,619
I appreciate a good fighter,
mr. Keller.

326
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:28,222
Sarcasm from some
shit-fuck cop killer,

327
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:32,060
however, is something i
simply will not tolerate.

328
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:35,496
I'm prepared to make you an offer.

329
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:36,997
Listening?

330
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:46,440
I asked you a question.

331
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,675
Are we listening?

332
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:51,512
Yeah, i'm listening.

333
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:52,546
Good.

334
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:57,218
Pray, gentlemen, a word with you.

335
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:04,425
Apparently, some of you have
requested religious counseling.

336
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:09,397
Well, we aim to please,

337
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,499
so the holy sisters of mercy

338
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:14,402
have come in answer of your prayers.

339
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,637
Now, mind your
manners and play nice...

340
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,441
or i'll reach my fist so
far up your asses

341
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,443
i'll pull out your lungs.

342
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,477
Clear?

343
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,148
Dr. Rosenbloom:
they're all penguins!

344
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:31,252
They're all penguins! It's a
conspiracy! A conspiracy!

345
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,187
[Quacks]

346
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:43,297
sister, i must talk with you.

347
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:44,832
I have sinned.

348
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:48,402
I am hereto listen to
your troubles, my son.

349
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:51,839
I can only imagine the
sick fantasies

350
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:54,175
rolling around in
your head right now.

351
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,843
Now that you mention it,

352
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,246
the outfit is kind of kinky.

353
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:01,615
Eat me.

354
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,452
I'm glad to see you're alive.

355
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:06,220
You got anything yet?

356
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:08,822
Nothing yet.

357
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:12,726
However, the warden runs a
small-time black-market cockfight.

358
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,094
He wants me to fight.

359
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,366
What are you gonna do?

360
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:39,753
You guys got anything yet?

361
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:42,790
Negative.

362
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:46,627
There is something, though...
what?

363
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,863
U.s. marshals office has a
man in here, deep cover.

364
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,500
Been here about a month
working on the same case.

365
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:56,304
He's their top mole,
real performer.

366
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:57,638
I'll keep an eye out for him.

367
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,542
When do you come back?

368
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,545
One week.

00:41:03,263 --> 00:41:05,365
i will kill you.

557
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,137

558
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,271
Promise.

560
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:16,242
preston here.

561
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:17,945
Caesar: don't preston me.

562
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,479
Inform me.

563
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:20,914
He's clean.

564
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:23,083
I know you have an agent there.

565
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:24,284
Find him.

566
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:25,352
Kill him.

567
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:27,921
Make it look accidental.

568
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:29,589
We begin in 7 days.

569
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:31,391
Understood.

570
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:32,659
Sir, if i may make a suggest...

[dogs barking]

574
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:47,540
winston: listen up. I
know all about your cover.

575
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:49,209
Your commander anderson communicated

576
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:50,642
to my section chief,
who then leaked

577
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:52,412
the intel down to me.

578
00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:54,281
How?

579
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:56,183
Through our head guard mr. Files.

580
00:41:57,717 --> 00:41:58,717
Files? But...

581
00:41:58,718 --> 00:42:00,153
he knows nothing about it.

582
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,589
Rosenbloom and i have
got him hooked up

583
00:42:02,622 --> 00:42:04,491
on a pcp-cocaine combo.

584
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:07,127
You see, files knows that rosenbloom

585
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,561
needs outside constituents.

586
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:12,032
So i make out my grocery
order list to my contact,

587
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:14,467
and then files hooks up
with him on the outside,

588
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:17,237
and the shit comes down
to us via single flower.

589
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:20,173
The flower's encrypted?

590
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,207
Acetylene?

591
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,342
Bingo.

592
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,978
Water, a little lemon juice, voila!

593
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:27,047
Invisible ink.

594
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,049
My plastic homing pigeon
to the outside world.

595
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:31,518
What do you know about the
missing inmates?

596
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,453
[Sighs]
not much.

597
00:42:33,486 --> 00:42:36,056
Men are executed on a regular basis,

598
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:38,458
ostensibly by orders of the state.

599
00:42:38,491 --> 00:42:40,360
But when, uh, family or friends come

600
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:41,561
to collect the remains,

601
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:43,463
zip, nada, nothing.

602
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:45,665
This corpse-snatching, it
doesn't make any sense.

603
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:46,778
I've pressed all my sources,

604
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:48,335
but i can't figure it out.

605
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:49,469
There's no rhyme or reason

606
00:42:49,502 --> 00:42:50,970
to steal dead cons.

607
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:53,573
That's about it for now.

608
00:42:53,606 --> 00:42:55,242
Meet you at the mess in 20.

609
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,278
Aah!

610
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,394
Guard: go get him! Grab his arms!

611
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:36,855
Easy! Easy!

612
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:46,093
Thanks.

613
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:50,163
Like i said,
you're mine.

614
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:53,266
Only on my terms,
no one else's.

615
00:44:04,244 --> 00:44:05,312
[Door opens]

616
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:09,881
hey.

617
00:44:09,882 --> 00:44:11,751
What are you working on, blaire?

618
00:44:11,784 --> 00:44:14,554
Oh, trying to construct a pattern

619
00:44:14,587 --> 00:44:18,191
that needs a little old-fashioned
extrapolation.

620
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:20,293
5 prison facilities,

621
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:21,694
including fuego,

622
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:24,431
all within 300 miles of each other.

623
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:27,167
Connect the dots,

624
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,369
you have some
what of a circle.

625
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,304
Schrek's transport was disabled

626
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:34,607
on interstate 62 going
west out of fuego.

627
00:44:34,641 --> 00:44:37,344
So somewhere within here
is our answer, huh?

628
00:44:37,377 --> 00:44:38,711
Ha.

629
00:44:38,745 --> 00:44:39,612
Yeah, wonderful.

630
00:44:39,646 --> 00:44:42,749
Only, that leaves about
1,000 square miles

631
00:44:42,782 --> 00:44:44,717
of mountain and
desert as possibilities,

632
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:47,454
and, uh, we don't even know for sure

633
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,456
if schrek is connected to
the missing bodies

634
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:50,723
of executed inmates.

635
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:52,259
Hmm.

636
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,532
Well, let's hope keller comes up

637
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:55,228
with some more useful information.

638
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:56,729
Yeah.

639
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:59,566
Have your report on my
desk in the morning.

640
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,600
You got it.

641
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:01,668
Go left, right.

642
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:03,270
That's it. Go, turn, turn.

643
00:45:03,303 --> 00:45:04,571
Hands up. Here you go, come on.

644
00:45:05,905 --> 00:45:07,640
That's it. Go, go.

645
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:08,914
That's it. Go. Left roundhouse.

00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,145
Stay back. Go back, go back.

648

Ok.

649
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,547
That's it. Stand up.

650
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,352
You ain't showing him right, man.

651
00:45:23,923 --> 00:45:25,725
See, it's the element of surprise

652
00:45:25,758 --> 00:45:27,527
that throws the enemies off.

653
00:45:28,928 --> 00:45:30,497
Isn't it right, keller?

654
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:34,567
Man: this is it, man.

655
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:35,802
Watch this, boys.

656
00:45:39,939 --> 00:45:41,708
I see your point.

one more blow, and you
snap his windpipe.
