Hawaii.

Waikiki Beach.

6
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,729
Picture...postcard...perfect.

7
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,133
But if you turn
that postcard over

8
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,335
there's another side to it.

9
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,403
Where the real
stories are told.

'Thank you, baby.'

17
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,763

'Wasn't even a minute.
Give me my fucking money back.'

24
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,684
Wait, sir! Stop!

- Let go!
- What you doing?

37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,981
What happened to mace?

38
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,816
- Mace isn't strong enough.
- For what?

39
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,818
- To kill him.
- Are you fucking serious?

40
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,820
Misha! That's what I'm here for.

I can feel him.

46
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,514
I can feel him growing in me.

47
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,651
* Ah ah *

48
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,923
(Ray)
My name is Ray Geronimo.

49
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,692
That's my girl Misha Domingo.

* Yeah hey *

52
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,338
(Ray)
Every year
five million tourists

53
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,606
come and stay
in hotels built on swamp land.

54
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,845
Our Waikiki

55
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,680
mine and Misha's

56
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,349
it's not postcard pretty.

57
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,851
* Hey hey hey hey *

58
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:48,956
Once the clock strikes 12:00

59
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,425
we come out the rocks
like a wayo wayo

60
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,328
scavenging small fish
with big eyes.

61
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,597
The black pimps
from the mainland

62
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,766
they run things
from Yoko Hill Theater.

63
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,001
The slingers, the surf rats

64
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,470
the welfare queens

65
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,305
they live in walk-up
low rises like us.

66
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:06,907
Or on the streets.

67
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,344
God's forgotten children.

68
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,448
(Misha)
Tell me about the house.

69
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,585
(Ray)
Somewhere in the country.

70
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,421
Near the beach.

71
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,957
You can teach
your son how to swim.

72
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,459
Like a fish.

73
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,828
[instrumental music]

74
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,730
Nothing big or fancy.

75
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,966
A two bedroom, you know?

76
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,337
Like "Hansel and Gretel."

77
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,741
[chuckles]
You could plant the garden.

78
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,877
I could build a boat.

79
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:50,584
And I'll slow down,
for the baby, I promise.

80
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,023
We need another girl.

81
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,026
- Never!
- Come on.

82
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,028
You hear me? Never!

83
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,699
You want another girl?

84
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,368
Oh, we need more money.

85
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,504
You want the house,
you want the dream.

86
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,473
We need another girl.

87
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,408
We don't need anyone else.

88
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,810
Fuck that!

89
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,779
Fuck that!

00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,847
Hey!

91
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:20,948
- Fuck it!
- Stop it!

92
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:22,616
- 'Fuck it!'
- Come on, you're pregnant.

93
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,651
Fuck that!

102
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,689
Eyes are the
windows to the soul.

103
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,024
How much?

104
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,125
A dollar.

105
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,793
- A dollar?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,898
Hey, keep the change.

107
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,835
What's your name?
What're you doing after--

108
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,638
- 'Misha!'
- Sorry. Got to go.

- Oh.
- Oh, what's up, Rick?

119
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,719
Hey, how's it?

120

You see that good-looking girl?

- Yeah.
- Misha.

124
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,827
Come on, bro.
Twenty feet, man.

125
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,096
- I know.
- How long can you bust it?

126
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,198
Eh, what now, she..
She hooks?

127
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,068
No way, she too pretty.

128
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,102
I'm not sure, brother.

129
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,236
She goes upstairs

130
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,673
maybe once
every couple of weeks.

131
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,308
You know, maybe she's just some
girl who got holiday fever.

132
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,177
Looking for
a sugar daddy, you know?

133
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,245
You mind
if I stick around?

134
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,147
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

135
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,021
I don't know when
she'll be back down.

136
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,290
Why? She stays upstairs
all night sometimes?

137
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,758
Yeah.

138
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,827
Hey, you still
livin' on..

139
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,996
Yeah, schools
are fuckin' terrible.

140
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,864
My kid's always
getting in trouble.

141
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,299
And the fuckin' drive's
a bitch.

142
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,934
But, shit, who can afford town?

143
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,235
But it must be nice.

144
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,870
- You live by the ocean.
- Shh.

145
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,106
Yeah, I live by the ocean.
Pitch a tent.

146
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,741
Like all the fuckin'
dirty homeless

147
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,042
that live on that side.

148
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,189
Hey, yo!

149
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,357
Yo!

150
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,826
I love your photographs.

151
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,360
Windows into the soul, right?

152
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,063
So, what do my eyes say?

153
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,665
- Confused.
- Hey, yo!

154
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,136
Look, I saw you, um, I saw you
come out of that hotel, right?

155
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,671
You saw me walk in, too.

156
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,373
Yeah, I saw you walk in, too.

157
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,674
Mm-hmm.

158
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,977
U-uh, the, um..

159
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,346
So you..

160
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,851
If you're gonna ask
me something, just ask.

161
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,886
So what do you do
besides bust balls?

162
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,320
[chuckles]

163
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,056
Not much.

164
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,858
What is this?

165
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,093
Hey, you're prettier than her.

166
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,362
Really.

167
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,364
You're a little liar.

168
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,266
What do you think?

169
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,002
You think you can
take a picture of me?

170
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,305
No, I'll pay you,
I'll pay you.

171
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,976
How much?

172
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,980
Uh, ah, what do you want?

173
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,883
Photography is about exposing
yourself to art work so..

174
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:56,917
Really?

175
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,719
Hundred bucks.

176
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,925
You're hired.

177
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,032
- What?
- Take it.

178
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,134

179
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,168

"I need to go to the bar, get
a drink," jet lag or something?

00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,491
So, he'll make trinkets
for tourists like

of Philippines

294

So...anyways it's like it would
take him half a day to make one

298

and then sell
it for like a dollar.

bring that with you?

That guy was huge.

557
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:49,627
He could have
strangled me if he wanted to.

558
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:52,397
Cut me to pieces
and no one would ever know.

559
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,901
Never again.

560
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:01,039
He wants to hook up

It's 200 grand.

569
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:40,345
Think we need maybe,
10 percent down to qualify?

570
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,214
It's 20 grand.

571

Okay.

579
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:13,144
We're gonna have to have
a system.

580
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:14,445
For security.

581
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,818

See, I got this one little crew.

742
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:53,470
They hit the beach

Look let me tell you
something about pride.

762
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,200
Pride ain't nothing but
a weak man's second rate guts.

763
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,303
I'm gonna take guts over pride

1092
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:26,842
* Or am I a fool

1093
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:29,378
* Who sits alone

1094
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:32,415
* Talking to the moon

1095
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:36,519
* Oh oh

1096
01:27:38,321 --> 01:27:40,856
* I know you're
somewhere out there *

1097
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:45,661
* Somewhere far away *
