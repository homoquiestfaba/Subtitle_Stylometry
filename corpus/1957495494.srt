A member of the police force
was hit by shrapnel

26
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,724

28
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,249
Troops were called in today

to restore order in the bureau,

30
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,732

foreign news reporter

His vehicle was
later set alight.

According to a police spokesman,

34
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,653
this unrest will only
serve to prolong

00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:41,351

Five, six, seven,
eight and kick.

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,793
But you don't honestly
believe this government

48
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,229
would allow us to float
around on stage

50
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:35,840
Yeah, I do.

51

Well girl, you can always go
back to the ballet.

00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:42,630
What ballet?

53
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,588
That's not what this
country wants to see.

54
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:45,546
Uh-uh.

00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:49,289
That's what they wanna see.

57
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:52,292
Well, lover, you can be
thankful for that.

58
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,597
It's when they stop
wanting to see them.

59
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,338
That's when you know
it's all over.

60
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:58,254
What?

61
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,605
I went to church, with
Steph's parents.

62
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,346
Can you believe that?

63
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,174
Oh God.
Oh, exactly.

64
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,439
They were so fucking weird.

65
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:10,527
Hardly spoke.

66
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:17,273
And Steph, it's kind of like, he
was scared of them.

67
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,842
Like he worshiped them
or something.

68
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:24,149
It was like there, right in
front of me where he came from.

69
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:29,329
If I could just get
through to him.

70
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:33,594
If I could just soften him
somehow, then...

71
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,337
You think too much, darling.

72
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:40,470
I don't know.

73
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,254
He's changed.

75
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:53,788
Sorry, missus.

76
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,311
I'm sorry he fell.

77
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:06,801
Bye.

Need a push?

00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,003
Would you, please?

87
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:59,375
Can I give you a lift somewhere?

88
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,768
No.

89
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,509
I don't think so.

90
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:05,207
Unless you want to drive me
to the township.

91
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,687
Oh.

92
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,514
Right.

93
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,256
Well, bye.

94
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,823

98
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:21,109
I didn't think you'd
arrived yet.

99
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,458
How long have you got?

100
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,328
Two days.

101

105
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:13,525
He was about 10 years old.

106
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,267
I had seen him many times,
perhaps hundreds.

107
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:21,882
He was small for his age, and
seemed deeply afraid.

108
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,886
His future, you could say,
seemed uncertain.

109
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:31,848
In fact, from where I stood,
it seemed doomed.

111
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,551
One day, they will slaughter us,
my boy.

112
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,119
They will overwhelm us.

113
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:45,688
Yeah, and on that day, it will
be up to you to protect us.

114

You're looking for kak, you come
to the right place.

129
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,989
I'm not looking for anything,
man.

130
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:09,816
Fuck you.

131
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:13,776
Fuck off, you're gonna get hurt.

Fuck you, Tront.

136
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,939
This is how you are now.

137
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,375
Wait until you hate the ground.

Take your fucking dog.

150
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,213
It's not my dog, commandant.

151
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,736

Still looking at these pictures,
hey ma?

163
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,416
You were a funny looking child.

164
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,376
You still are.

165
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:03,946
Hey, he would have been
good for you.

166
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,296
Instead, look at you.

167
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,170
You at 28 years old
with no wife.

168
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,519
What's the matter with you?

169
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,266
I'm tired.

170
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,832
Tired? Tired?

171
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:23,270
You're always tired.

00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,057
At this time of the night.

174
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:32,888
Hey, good evening, mother.

175
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,802
I'm not your mother..

176
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,760
Hey Vusi, man. What's happening?

177
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,153
Are you coming?

178
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,111

hey?

189
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,620
Gotcha.

190
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,622
You shouldn't be on the streets,
my China.

191
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,493
Come on, leave him, man.

192
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,668
Where's your dumb pass.

193
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:18,978
There.

194
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:19,979
That's not a pass.

195
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,154
This is a pass.

196
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:30,946
Right.

197
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:35,646
From now on, you will no
longer be required

198
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,865
to think for yourselves.

199
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,301
You can leave it up to us.

200
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,868

Oh man, where are you going?

207

Can't you see we're just getting
all warmed up here?

208
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,368
No, man.

209
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:03,631
Better get back.

Where are you going?

Hey, Bingo.

224
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:04,170
This way of yours.

225
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,478
You're gonna get yourself
killed, my friend.

226
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:10,741
My way is the only way.

227
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:12,961
Direct action.

228
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,616
We're building something here.

229
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:16,965
And you, what are you doing?

230
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,447
You can't work for the
Boer forever.

231
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,971
Here is where you
have to put him.

232
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,931
So what?

233
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,325
We have to die to be free?

234
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:31,675
If necessary.

235
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,765
And that doesn't make you angry?

236
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,291
All our lives living like dogs.

237
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,557
And the only way to get our
dignity back is to die for it?

238
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:52,435
My friend, these Boers,
they've never changed.

239
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,135
Check their schools out.

240
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,180
They don't learn our history.

can live in dignity,

245
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,017
then so be it.

246
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,156
You got to be here, my bra,
with us.

I was just looking at you,
that's all.

Tell me.

a place anyway

00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:33,772
Might as well start now.

No, no, no, no.

371
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:36,513
You don't have to do that.

372
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:37,123
You could...

373
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:41,388
Look, I don't live too
far from here.

374
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,217
You can stay at my place
tonight if you want.

375
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,872
No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

376
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:47,916
No, no, no. I have a
sleeping bag.

377
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,091
You could sleep on the floor.

378
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,963
Yeah, it should be okay.

379
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,922
Look, I insist. It was my
fault kind of.

380
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:58,013
Look, the thing is,

381
00:29:58,057 --> 00:30:00,320
I've never had to walk home from
here alone at night.

382
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:03,932
And well, it's a bit of
a dodgy area.

383
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:06,805
I'd appreciate the company.

384
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,417
Yeah. It's no problem.

385
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:19,818
It's okay.

386
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:20,906
It's okay. Come.

387
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:22,864
Come in.

388
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,701
I don't think I have any foam,

389
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:36,747
but I think these things have
their own padding, don't they?

390
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,708
Please, come in.

391
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,492
Sit down, make
yourself comfortable.

392
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:51,458
Okay.

393
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,068
So tea, Rooibos?

394
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:55,462
Okay.

395
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:09,258
Do you think...

396
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,435
It's just...

397
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:14,960
It's just that...

398
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:19,138
I'll go.

399
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:19,965
No, no, no, no.

400
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:21,401
Don't be silly.

401
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:22,271
It's just...

402
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:26,319
If they found me in your flat,

403
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,277
it might not look right.

404
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,718
What if someone saw us come in?

405
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:36,242
So I'll go.

406
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:38,374
No, no, please, please don't.

407
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,072
It's okay.

408
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:40,507
You know, it's just,

409
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:45,207
you hear about people calling
the police sometimes, but...

410
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,085
You know what?

411
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:53,912
Fuck 'em.

412
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,354
[soft music]

413
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:23,506
Oh, here.

414
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,225
Well, thank you, Emma.

415
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:06,506
You called me Emma.

416
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:09,770
That is what people do.

417
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,512
Call each other by their names.

418
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:15,732
It sounds silly,

419
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,388
but no black man has ever
called Emma before.

420
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,652
It's nice.

421
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:24,654
Hey, I'm glad you liked it.

422
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,701
That's the first time I've
called a white woman

423
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:28,658
by her first name.

424
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:30,921
Strange country, huh?

425
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:35,491
That it takes so long just to
get to know a woman's name.

426
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,798
[chuckles]

427
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:42,716
Well, goodbye.

428
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:45,762
Bye, Joseph.

429
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:56,338
It's Vusisizwe.

430
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,777
My real name.

431
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:03,041
Vusisizwe.

432
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,045
That's beautiful.

433
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,524
What does it mean?

434
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,224
It means to wake.

435
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:15,401
To wake up.

436
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,492
Oh, well goodbye Vusi...

437
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,540
Hey, Vusi to you.

438
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:26,542
Vusi is good enough.

439
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:27,891
Okay. Goodbye, Vusi.

440
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:02,622
[somber music]

441
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:26,646
[Vusisizwe VOICEOVER] His
future, you could say,

442
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:27,821
seemed uncertain.

443
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,479
In fact, from where I stood,
it seemed doomed.

444
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,961
And this little boy, his
name was Vusisizwe.

445
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,182
His teachers, they all told him,

446
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:45,752
"One day, you will go out and
work in the white man's world.

447
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,103
In his kitchens, and
his gardens.

448
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:53,107
And Vusisizwe is much too
complicated for them.

449
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:57,329
Better that you use a
name like Joseph.

450
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:00,810
They like that."

451
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:05,032
But then this little
boy said no.

452
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:09,993
His father had told him that his
name was Vusisizwe

453
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:12,257
and that he should be
proud of it.

454
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,781
It carried the spirit of
his ancestors.

455
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,175
It belonged to him.

456
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:23,181
But you see, when this boy
began to grow up,

457
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:26,358
he found that he slowly began
to lose this spirit,

458
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:28,360
his rebellion.

459
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:31,232
And he found in order to
make a living,

460
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:34,192
that he would have to go and
work in the white man's world.

461
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,585
And that is what he did.

462
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:40,372
And every night he
tried to dream,

463
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:43,766
to remember that child,
remember his spirit,

464
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,813
but no matter how hard he tried,

465
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:48,510
he just couldn't.

466
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:51,513
Until the man realized that
inside he was dead

467
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:54,908
and that all that would ever
come were the nightmares

468
00:36:56,475 --> 00:37:00,783
and a great, great fear for his
people, for their future.

469
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:10,271
Oh, what the fuck is that?

470
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:14,014
Looks like a fucking rat
wearing a G-string.

471
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,713
Look, it's not my idea,
all right?

472
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:20,368
Marcel loves the finale.

473
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,370
Just that he thinks
that this thing

474
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:24,851
will give it that extra
little edge of-

475
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:25,852
Disaster?

476
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:29,943
Look, just think about it.

477
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:32,380
Yeah, right.

478
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,254
All right, Joseph.

479
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:39,822
Oh God.
Oh thank you, Fonz.

480
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,084
You prick.

481
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,353
You must have wondered what
happened to it.

482
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,965
I thought I dropped it
on the train.

483
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:54,576
I'm sorry I didn't give it back
to you right away.

484
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,406
But I did read some of it.

485
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,582
And I just have to say, I
really loved it.

486
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:01,757
I couldn't put it down.

487
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:05,848
Oh well, it's just a
children's story.

488
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:07,633
Still have to change the names.

489
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:09,374
Finish it, all that kinda stuff.

490
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:11,245
What will you do with it?

491
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,333
What will I do with it?

492
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,030
Yeah. You could publish it.

493
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:14,944
[Vusisizwe laughing]

494
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:16,076
I don't know. You really could.

495
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,686
It's good. I wasn't
just saying that.

496
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,818
Oh, no.

497
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:20,602
It's just for me, I guess.

498
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:22,648
It's just my thoughts,
that's all.

499
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:25,868
Like I said, it's just
a kid's story.

500
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:27,043
Oh, you see?

501
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,089
I thought it was much
more than that.

502
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,613
I mean, you know, not that a
kid's story makes it any...

503
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,836
That's not mine.

504
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,228
I mean...

505
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:39,578
No, no, no, it's not mine.

506
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:41,144
I mean you saw what
happened there.

507
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:43,277
You saw him give that
to us and...

508
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,104
No, no.

509
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:44,974
I know. I know.

510
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:46,889
All right, thanks.

511
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,764
[both laughing]

512
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:52,634
Shit.

513
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,552
Well, goodbye.

514
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:01,643
Hey.

515
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,908
How about a cup of tea
and a sleeping bag

516
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:08,433
in exchange for an escort home,
huh?

517
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:09,303
A deal?

518
00:39:11,174 --> 00:39:12,045
Tea sounds good.

519
00:39:16,658 --> 00:39:19,313
[phone ringing]

520
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:23,404
Hello?
Yeah, Em.

521
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:27,060
Listen, we drop tomorrow night.

522
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,670
I just wanted to hear you.

523
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,064
I wanted to ask you something.

524
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,632
What?

525
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:34,894
What did you wanna ask?

526
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,461
Let's do it.

527
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,114
What?

528
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,421
Get married like we dreamed of?

529
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,249
You and me.

530
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,775
You're crazy?

531
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:49,125
Yeah.

532
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:50,997
I know.

533
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:55,305
So listen, does that
mean you will?

534
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:58,744
Will you?

535
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:02,965
I suppose.

536
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:05,838
You suppose? What do you
mean you suppose?

537
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:07,840
[soft music]

538
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:08,884
I suppose.

539
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,453
Yes.

540
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,281
You're sure?

541
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:15,151
Yes.

542
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,678
So we'll do it then?

543
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,810
Yeah, yeah, we will.

544
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:22,681
We will.

545
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:24,639
Okay then.

546
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:27,207
Look, I better get back.

547
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,513
I'm on guard duty tonight.

548
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,168
Look, we'll talk later, huh?

549
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:37,957
You take care of yourself, okay?

550
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:40,133
Yeah.

551
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:42,004
Yeah, I will.

552
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:43,397
I'll see ya.

553
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,267
Bye.

554
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:46,574
Em, Em!

555
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:52,319
Shit.

556
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:57,759
Yeah.

557
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,646
Are you okay?

558
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:18,258
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,173
No, no, no, no. I'm okay.

560
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,008
Come.

561
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:47,287
[siren wailing]

562
00:41:52,988 --> 00:41:53,946
I envy you.

563
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,341
You envy me?

564
00:41:58,385 --> 00:41:59,908
Yeah.

565
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:01,431
You know why I do?

566
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,782
Because you belong here,

567
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:07,612
and this is your country.

568
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:09,396
It's yours too.

569
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,399
You're born here.

570
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,534
My parents are from England.

571
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:22,540
So it's always been this kind of

572
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,676
safety raft, floating out
there somewhere,

573
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,591
just in case things
get a bit too...

574
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,682
Black.

575
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:40,209
Yeah.

576
00:42:41,341 --> 00:42:42,168
I'm sorry.

577
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:45,737
Your story really got to me.

578
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:52,221
[somber music]

579
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:00,839
You must really hate them

580
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:06,061
for what they're doing
to this country.

581
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:09,325
Yeah.

582
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:12,111
Of course I do.

583
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:17,246
But my love for this country,

584
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,384
for my people, is stronger
than that hate.

585
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:27,822
It has to be.

586
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:33,001
That's the trick, you see?

587
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:40,008
Otherwise, I'm nothing.

588
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:52,847
You know,

589
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:59,637
I really could take a close look
at that car of yours.

590
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,942
[Emma chuckles]

591
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:02,204
If you want me to.

592
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:08,994
What?

593
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,956
You are a strange man.

594
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:18,307
Thank you.

00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,301
How many times have I
told you that?

599
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:56,215
They're like animals.

600
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:58,870
They're not like the rest of us.

601
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,308
You must go away, do you hear?

602
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:03,570
Before I kill you.

603
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:05,485
It's up to me to protect.

604
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:07,269
Go away. Do you hear?

605
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:12,274
Wait.

606
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:13,145
Phindi.

607
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:14,842
I'm sorry.

608
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:16,539
It's just a game.

609
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:17,497
Come back.

610
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:28,073
Okay.

611
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:28,987
Try it now.

[car engine revving]

613
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,445
Come.

614
00:45:52,488 --> 00:45:53,402
Where?

615
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:54,490
I'll take you home.

616
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,536
To the township?

617
00:45:57,624 --> 00:45:59,234
Well, it's where you live,
isn't it?

618
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:00,540
Yeah, it's where I live, but...

619
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:01,584
But what, huh?

620
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:05,632
You wouldn't be embarrassed to
be seen with me, would you?

621
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:06,981
No.

622
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:08,156
It's just that I don't think
it'd be a good idea.

623
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,983
That's all.

624
00:46:09,984 --> 00:46:11,899
But if you really want to...

625
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:12,770
I do.

626
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:15,294
Okay.

Where are you heading, ma'am?

630

To the township.

631
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:04,909
Township?

632
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:07,041
It's not safe for a young woman
alone such as yourself.

633
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:08,434
Look what they're doing now.

634
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:10,001
I'm not alone.

635
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,829
The madam is taking me home,
boss.

636
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:16,137
Yeah, well, I'd drop him
on the outskirts

637
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:17,443
and turn around and go
straight back home

638
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:18,487
if I were you, okay?

639
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:20,315
Yes, boss.

640
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:24,145
Okay?

If I would have one
wish right now,

648
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:30,228
it'd be that the the nightmares
would end for you.

649
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:31,794

No, I'll be okay. Really.

655
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:57,054
You go on back.

656
00:50:58,272 --> 00:51:00,100
It's just over there.

657
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:00,970

Bye.

Do you hear?

670
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:45,961
Before I kill you.

671
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,180
It's up to me.

672
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:49,051
To protect.

00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:50,966
Do you hear?

with you, Oosthuizen?

you're gonna open it,

I tell you what?

We can pray together.

here somewhere.

No, I'm fine.

00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:47,202
Are you sure?

I know I've got one, somewhere.

724
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:50,989
Thank you, no.

725
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:53,382
If the show keeps going
late like this,

726
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,297
we're gonna have to buy you one.

727
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:20,061
Come sleep here.

It's okay.

There's no need to sleep on the
floor, that's all.

comfortable here.

For being my friend.

01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:38,129
Fuck.

748
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:40,740
On the ground, now.

749
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,829
Steph.
What the fuck is this?

750
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:44,962
This isn't what you think.

751
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:46,528
No, he couldn't sleep
on the floor.

752
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:48,182
Get up. Get off there.

753
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:50,837
Okay, okay.

754
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:52,752
Steph, please.

755
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:53,622
Please just stop.

756
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:55,581
Stop.

757
01:01:55,624 --> 01:01:57,844
Stop, I can explain, Steph.

01:02:14,643 --> 01:02:15,470
Oh, shit.

761
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:29,789
Don't you look at her.

762
01:02:30,964 --> 01:02:32,749
I don't want you
fucking looking her.

763
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:38,058
Three months.

764
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:44,848
Three months, soldier boy,

765
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:46,763
and I'll be waiting for you.

766
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:51,115
Try three fucking weeks.

767
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,249
Stephy, what happened?

768
01:02:55,293 --> 01:02:56,468
What happened to you?

769
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,862
No, no, no, no, no, Em.

770
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,298
You want to know what
happened to me, fine.

771
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:02,169
But first you tell me
what happened here.

772
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:03,692
Stephy, this is Joseph.

773
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:06,870
Do you think that I want
to know his name?

775
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:14,616
He does the lights at the show.

776
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:16,575
It was late.

777
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:19,447
I said he could stay the night
because of the curfew.

778
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:24,061
We couldn't find any from...

779
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:24,975
Yeah.

780
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:26,628
Steph, nothing happened.

781
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:27,542
Really, nothing happened.

782
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:28,413
Oh yeah.

783
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:34,636
Please, please just,
just let him go.

784
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:36,856
Please.

785
01:03:38,162 --> 01:03:40,425
And we can talk about this out,
all right?

786
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:46,692
And we can talk?

787
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:49,260
Yeah.

788
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,271
Okay, he can go.

791
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:26,558
One day, they will slaughter us,
my boy.

792
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:28,299
They will overwhelm us.

793
01:04:28,342 --> 01:04:31,476
Yeah, and on that day, it'll be
up to you to protect us.

794
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:35,567
You take one more step and it's
tickets, my friend.

795
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:37,482
Kaput.

[Emma sobbing]

797
01:04:41,094 --> 01:04:43,662
You think I can just let him
walk out of here?

798
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:49,668
AWOL from the army.

799
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,324
I come all this way to
see my sticky.

800
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:56,631
And what do I find?

801
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:01,723
She's in bed, with a kaffir.

802
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:02,942
No.

803
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,117
That's what happened to me.

804
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:05,466
Steph.

805
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:09,296
You think that I can possibly
swallow this shit?

806
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:13,692
Here.

807
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,000
Here, a nice piece of floor.

808
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:19,698
And here, a nice piece of floor.

But no, no, no, no, no, Emmy.

812
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,794
So let me tell you one thing,
Emmy.

813
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:31,536
No one is going anywhere

814
01:05:31,579 --> 01:05:34,365

is going on here.

dreamed we'd dance.

What's wrong, man?

You don't think she's beautiful?

Stop, Steph. Please,
don't do this.

'cause see, she could never tell
me something like that.

anything while she was here.

1115
01:31:02,021 --> 01:31:02,848
Answer me.

1116
01:31:05,285 --> 01:31:07,113
Is that what you want?

1117
01:31:12,118 --> 01:31:13,511
No.

1118
01:31:13,555 --> 01:31:15,034
No, I just want...

1119
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:22,041
Drop it, China.

1120
01:31:22,085 --> 01:31:22,999
Drop it.

1121
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:24,435
Drop...

1122
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,220
[gunshot blares]

1123
01:31:27,264 --> 01:31:29,832
[somber music]

1124
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:02,952
Emmy.

1125
01:32:04,431 --> 01:32:05,258
Emmy.

1126
01:32:10,873 --> 01:32:11,700
Emmy.

1127
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:13,919
Oh God.

1128
01:32:13,963 --> 01:32:16,139
[sobbing]

1129
01:33:33,695 --> 01:33:36,436
[sirens wailing]

1130
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:07,424
Mr. Oosthuizen, you have
testified that you were alone

1131
01:34:07,467 --> 01:34:09,208
at the time of Ms. Hughes'
death.

1132
01:34:10,775 --> 01:34:12,995
But the laboratory
report shows clearly

1133
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:18,043
that there was another person in
the flat at the same time,

1134
01:34:18,087 --> 01:34:20,611
as two sets of fingerprints were
found on the rifle.

1135
01:34:21,743 --> 01:34:23,440
The other set, it has
been ascertained

1136
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:24,963
were not those of Ms. Hughes.

1137
01:34:26,486 --> 01:34:27,705
So I ask you again,

1138
01:34:29,098 --> 01:34:32,362
was there another person
with you in the flat,

1139
01:34:32,405 --> 01:34:33,972
at the time of Ms. Hughes'
death?

1140
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:48,900
No.

1141
01:34:48,944 --> 01:34:51,337
[soft music]

1142
01:34:55,037 --> 01:34:57,953
Out of the experience of an
extraordinary human disaster

1143
01:34:59,258 --> 01:35:04,350
that lasted too long, must
be born a society

1144
01:35:04,394 --> 01:35:07,832
of which all humanity
will be proud.

1145
01:35:13,098 --> 01:35:14,970
A common victory for justice,

1146
01:35:16,188 --> 01:35:18,582
for peace, for human dignity.

1147
01:35:21,367 --> 01:35:25,981
The time for the healing of
the wounds has come.

1148
01:35:26,024 --> 01:35:28,679
The moment to bridge the chasms
that divides us has come.

1149
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:35,294
The time to build is upon us.

1150
01:35:49,874 --> 01:35:50,919
It's funny.

1151
01:35:54,966 --> 01:35:58,448
I've never wanted to grow
anything before.

1152
01:36:13,463 --> 01:36:15,639
[sobbing]

1153
01:36:23,821 --> 01:36:26,389
[gentle music]

1154
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:36,660
What's that?

1155
01:36:36,703 --> 01:36:37,835
A cane, man.

1156
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,403
Hey, you're gonna need it.

1157
01:36:40,446 --> 01:36:42,231
Keep all those little
horses in line.

1158
01:36:53,024 --> 01:36:54,634
No, man.

1159
01:36:54,678 --> 01:36:55,505
You keep it.

1160
01:36:56,506 --> 01:36:57,463
You hang on to it.

1161
01:37:06,124 --> 01:37:08,083
The boy looked up at
the morning sky,

1162
01:37:09,301 --> 01:37:10,128
at the new sun

1163
01:37:12,565 --> 01:37:15,830
and took a deep, deep breath
and held it there.

1164
01:37:17,309 --> 01:37:20,051
He just wanted to keep all
those smells inside him

1165
01:37:20,095 --> 01:37:23,446
for a moment, and
then [whooshes]

1166
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:30,235
he let the air out all at once.

1167
01:37:32,977 --> 01:37:35,762
Beautiful early
morning to be alive.

1168
01:37:39,244 --> 01:37:41,029
The boy's name is Vusisizwe.

1169
01:37:42,944 --> 01:37:45,511
[somber music]

1170
01:37:59,917 --> 01:38:01,005
Vusi, see you.

1171
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:06,576
[soft melancholic music]

1172
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:14,453
[singing in foreign language]
