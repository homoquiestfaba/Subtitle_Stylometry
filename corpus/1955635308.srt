1
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,634
Dear Joshua.

2
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,805
I know it's been nearly six
years since you heard from me.

3
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,143
I can't believe you're
already in tenth grade.

4
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:55,547
It's like time has
flown by and stood still

5
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,149
all at the same time.

6
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,752
It's usually a father's hope
that his son will follow

7
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:05,190
in his footsteps. Thankfully,
that won't be the case with us.

8
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,760
I never meant to
hurt you, Josh...

9
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,331
But I have failed you
in every way possible.

10
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:19,238
My intention with this letter is
to properly say good-bye to you.

11
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,842
Why it's taken me so
long, I don't know.

12
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,712
Maybe I'm a coward after all.

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,616
Make your mark in
this world, son.

14
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,318
Always be your mom's protector.

15
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,555
And no matter what
you hear about me,

16
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,658
you keep moving forward...
And never look back.

17
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,896
Your father.

18
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,203
Ooh, that
motherfucker hung himself, bro!

19
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,405
Hell no, that
buster got deal with, homey!

20
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,207
What happened, Lopez?

21
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,375
Homey had issues, sir.

22
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,612
-Suicide, my ass.
Stick Lopez in the hole.

23
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,981
Photograph everything
before you take him down.

24
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,616
No, wait.

25
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,353
Don't do anything yet.

26
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,456
Code four.

27
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,630
Looks like two of you will be
leaving the block today, money.

28
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,699
Let me get you outta here.

29
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,001
This fucking mess
will take all day.

30
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,911
Your gate money,
200, and your cdcr ID.

31
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,380
Use it until you get
a new driver's license.

32
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,955
The Van outside will take
you to the train station.

33
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,259
Just take it one day
at a time, money.

34
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,361
From the beast.

35
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,379
What's up, wood?

36
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,916
Man, good to see you, brother.

37
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,052
Welcome.

38
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,654
That's for you, man.

39
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,923
Picked that out myself.

40
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,624
Something in there just
to get you started.

41
00:05:59,626 --> 00:05:59,624
-Appreciate it.

42
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,728
-Got a big night
planned for you, bro.

43
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,831
Youngster ride there,
that's Howie.

44
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,566
He's the man with the plan.

45
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,536
-Should give you the
welcome home party.

46
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,638
-Told you he'd
know who you were.

47
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,674
Youngster's all star
struck and shit.

48
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,409
Hey, he's a sniper though, man.

49
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,111
Did work over there
in Afghanistan.

50
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,747
Only job you got now
is staying clean.

51
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,749
Roger that.

52
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,418
Fuck, let's go eat,
man. Whatever you want is on me.

53
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,719
Need a room, too.

54
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,122
-Of course. Time to lose
those parole duds, right?

55
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,491
Get you a whole new getup.
I got you, bro.

56
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,874
Ed kutcher, parole.

57
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,542
I got a tip
this sex offender has a

58
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,511
14-year-old girl in his place.

59
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,045
Waiting on the
damn warrant, though.

60
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,747
-No worries,
Lenny's one of my cases

61
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,115
so I'm your warrant.
-Good.

62
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,604
Kutcher.
Come to the door, Lenny.

63
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,609
Lenny, it's kutcher.

64
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,844
Come to the door.
You know the drill.

65
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,065
Drop it!

66
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,001
Go, go! Shit!
10-3, shots fired!

67
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,103
Repeat, shots fired!

68
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,552
What's up, chop?

69
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,822
What the hell, chopper?

70
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,025
It's been a minute, huh?

71
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,494
Welcome home, brother.

72
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,496
-Jason horvath.

73
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,763
It's an honor.

74
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,766
How about the name chef, huh?
Name mean anything to you?

75
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,835
Hell, every tweaker south
of folsom knows that name.

76
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:28,073
Any one of these bitches in
here, they're all fucking

77
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:31,676
dirt legs, dude. I'm telling
you, man. Every single one

78
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,945
of them, man, they're fucking
cheerleaders, brother.

79
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,214
You can literally do whatever
the fuck you want to them.

80
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,683
You want a drink? Smoke?
I got you, brother.

81
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,553
-He looks good, don't he?

82
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:42,821
-He looks good.

83
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,094
Hey,
you looking for a bathroom?

84
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,296
Come on, I'll show
you one more private.

85
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,735
Put your clothes on.

86
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,674
I could just get you
one of the other girls,

87
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,242
if you just tell me
which one you like.

88
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,614
What's your name?

89
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,016
Janie.

90
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,652
How about you and me get
a drink sometime, Janie?

91
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,754
Just not tonight.

92
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,090
Howie and shotgun
have my number, or--

93
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,325
i-I'll get it from them.

94
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,131
I need a ride.

95
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,733
Sure, money.

96
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:02,934
Everything okay?

97
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:03,802
Down!

98
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:08,974
Who's down?

99
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,645
Janie!

100
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,715
No, Janie. No! No!

101
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,120
No!

102
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,190
Hey, hey, hey!
Money, we gotta go!

103
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,992
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

104
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,131
You ain't inked. Get him outta
here in case we're stopped.

105
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,299
Come on!

106
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,801
Go, go, go. Come on, move.

107
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,975
Fuck!

108
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,811
This ride clean?

109
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,748
Insurance is up to
date, reg, everything.

110
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,050
I need it tonight.
Tell me where to drop you off.

111
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,352
I'll pull over here.

112
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,354
Catch the bus.

113
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,695
-They said you're not inked.

114
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,064
Nothing.

115
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,833
You answer only to me now.
You don't go near anyone,

116
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,302
especially if they're validated,
unless I authorize it.

117
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,337
You got it.

118
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,810
Get two prepaid cells,
both of them different.

119
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,046
Then be at my motel at 10 A.M.

120
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,414
-Copy that.

121
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,471
Charge. No basket.

122
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,839
Charge?
It's a pick-up game.

123
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:20,839
It's a foul!

124
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,742
You can't take a little bump
'n grind, get off the court.

125
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,243
It's all right.
Let's just play.

126
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,044
Lower the shoulder.

127
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,415
If greenman pulls that
shit again, I'm gonna kick

128
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,117
his pussy citigroup ass.

129
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,252
Yeah?
You bringing a stepladder?

130
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,989
How is this an opportunity
for a short joke right now?

131
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,425
Oh. Hirsch is predicting
Kelly will win if

132
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,060
the dow gets above 10-4.

133
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,161
Yeah, not in this market.

134
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,063
But still, metzger's
a republican.

135
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,464
Let's close him
asap, just in case.

136
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,466
All right.

137
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,101
Let's strategize tonight.

138
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,882
You know the rules, bud.

139
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,986
How was school today?

140
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,255
We made masks
for president's day.

141
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:10,255
Uh-huh.

142
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:14,425
I picked Abraham Lincoln.
I also made his hat.

143
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,861
That's so cool.
I can't wait to see it.

144
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,266
Turn the TV back on
when you're done, okay?

145
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,334
Mom upstairs?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,180
Hey, babe.

147
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,214
Hey.

148
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,989
You know, we got 45
minutes before we pick up

149
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,524
tom and Jennifer.

150
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,528
I just showered, lover.

151
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,564
I know. It's my favorite smell.

152
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:53,865
Okay.

153
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,600
Okay.

154
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,539
It's not happening, is it?
-No.

155
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,473
No.

156
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,611
Oh, by the way, your
design looks amazing.

157
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,847
Oh, thanks.
Did you see the floor samples?

158
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,048
-Pennies, right?

159
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,616
Finally, the
pennies are gonna fly.

160
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,885
Yeah, but how
long is it gonna take?

161
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,186
-To lay out the pennies?
-Yeah.

162
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,621
It's gonna take
a really long time.

163
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,389
That's why I have to ask
Jennifer for her help.

164
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:18,389
I'm gonna butter her up tonight.

165
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,159
Does everyone use the
same house for finals?

166
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,328
Yes. Even playing field.

167
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,496
Damn, I wanna live there.

168
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,065
I know, right?

169
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:30,602
Wait, wait, wait.

170
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:31,402
What did I do?

171
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,072
It's just-i just gotta--

172
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,540
-i knew it. I felt that coming.

173
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,574
You shouldn't have.

174
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,311
Jennifer, I also want
to let you know that I've

175
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,579
been eating asparagus.

176
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,915
No! No!

177
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,216
That's all I'm going to say.

178
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,386
Can we get another bottle?

179
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,054
You want one more?
Yeah, let's do it.

180
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,456
-This is nice.
This is a good place.

181
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:51,456
One more?

182
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:55,360
See, I honestly don't think
that baseball constitutes a

183
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,896
date night.
Like, that's not--

184
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,299
but they're dugout club
seats on the third base line.

185
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:04,002
-It's romantic,
and they're free.

186
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,137
-What?
-It's free, guys.

187
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,973
Okay, fine, fine, fine.
I will allow that, as long as

188
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,409
it means that Jennifer
and I can pick the next two.

189
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,477
Yes!

190
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:12,477
-Two? How did you get two?

191
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,446
Okay, we want John Mayer.
We get John Mayer.

192
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,482
John Mayer's not
free in any way.

193
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,350
-You are gonna brown-nose
your way into some

194
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,952
John Mayer tickets.

195
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,320
-Don't look at me.
Look at Jacob.

196
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,389
He's got the best knee
pads in the office.

197
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,490
And well used.

198
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:26,424
-Guys.

199
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,427
Wait until we close
the metzger account.

200
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,262
We'll see whose butts
are getting kissed, right?

201
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,530
-Yeah, that's right, partner.

202
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,366
Honey, the light!
Watch out!

203
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,321
No!

204
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,662
No! No! Tom!

205
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,368
Baby, no!
-Oh, my god!

206
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,301
(Kutcher] Sit down.

207
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,137
Your foreman called, Tony.
Why'd you miss work?

208
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,040
Especially after I went on
the hook and got you the damn

209
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,408
job in the first place.

210
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,310
Look, I know, okay?

211
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:53,011
Dante was sick, and my mom--

212
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:57,248
hey, hey, I don't wanna
hear about any of that.

213
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,617
No excuses.
You said you want a plan b,

214
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,386
instead of wasting
the rest of your life.

215
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,755
Look, it's hard, kutcher.
It's hard for me.

216
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,457
Of course it's hard.
You're a convicted felon.

217
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,060
Own the shit.
Rise above it.

218
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,528
Or I'll bust your ass
right back inside.

219
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:10,528
Don't think I won't.

220
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,032
Look, I will, I will.
I'll rise above it.

221
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,535
So, how's ed doing?

222
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,504
I don't know if
it's hit him yet.

223
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,739
Yeah, well, he saved that girl.
That's gotta feel pretty good.

224
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,776
Still, three of the best?

225
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,045
-Sorry for keeping
you waiting, Manny.

226
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,212
No worries, bro.

227
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,181
So, how you feeling, man?

228
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,682
I'm good. You?

229
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,153
For the record, everyone I know,
they high-fived after you put

230
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,622
that Jester down. Especially
after that fucker shot you.

231
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,593
You ready to catch
some cockroaches?

232
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,563
Yeah. Bring it.

233
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,500
-According to our ci, the beast
is doing an arms deal with this

234
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,070
Southern Mexican in
the next 48 hours.

235
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,639
He's ordered this guy, Jacob
harlon, goes by the street name

236
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:55,840
of money, to handle things.

237
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,275
Harlon hit the
streets yesterday.

238
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,709
This harlon validated?

239
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,711
No, but our ci says
he's a sleeper.

240
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,346
The beast, huh?

241
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,282
That dude's been running Cali
for the last 15 years...

242
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,117
All from the fucking hole, too.

243
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,253
You okay, ed?

244
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,389
I'm good. Keep going.

245
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,724
Come on, go.
I got work to do.

246
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,761
All right.
Any specifics on the deal?

247
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,196
Yeah.

248
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,332
A thousand full-auto
ak-47s, and at least

249
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,235
500 glocks smuggled
from Afghanistan

250
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,370
none registered in the U.S.

251
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,672
You alert atf ?

252
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,174
-And let them take our collar?
Hell no.

253
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,709
We're controlling
this one, brother.

254
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,311
I love it.
So, what's the plan?

255
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,346
Harlon faces strike three.
We nail that fucker,

256
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,814
get him to flip
on the beast. Simple.

257
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,783
Whole power structure
comes tumbling down.

258
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,751
All right. I'll start pounding
the streets on the eses,

259
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:40,751
see if anyone's talking.

260
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,888
I'll set up on harlon.
Meet with him later today.

261
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,423
Let's rock, fellas.

262
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,496
Face directly ahead,
please.

263
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,204
So, what's next?

264
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,639
The arraignment, right?

265
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,807
Yes. And I know
the prosecutor assigned to

266
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,610
your case. This guy's
a hard-charger, Jacob.

267
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,513
He only cares about his stats,
especially on dui manslaughter

268
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,217
cases. He's going for the
maximum sentencing guidelines,

269
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,854
four years plus an additional
three for great bodily injury

270
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,490
enhancement since the other
driver broke his legs.

271
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,692
We're talking about
seven years here, man.

272
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,427
Seven years.

273
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,599
Can we fight it?

274
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,236
Yeah. I mean,
we can go to trial, but...

275
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,774
I gotta be honest, man, the
evidence is pretty overwhelming.

276
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,710
It didn't help the intersection
had a traffic camera, either.

277
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,513
My advice is, you let me
go to the prosecutor now,

278
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:15,513
get him to make a deal.

279
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:19,717
Because if we go to trial, he
will stick to the maximums.

280
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,719
That's what they do.
That's how it works.

281
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:21,719
What kind of deal?

282
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,956
Look, you agree to
a no-contest plea...

283
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,358
I think I can get him
to two years on count one,

284
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,560
reduce the great
bodily injury enhancement...

285
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,762
To what's called
a dui with injury.

286
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,599
Now, that drops the additional
three years to eight months.

287
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,568
It means...

288
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,404
Realistically you'd only
have to do 16 months.

289
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,407
Yeah, 16 months. Ehm...

290
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,309
It's your call, pal.

291
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,622
Hey.

292
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,889
Hi.

293
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,459
Okay, so they accepted
the house as collateral.

294
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,862
So I can bail you out,
get you outta there. Okay?

295
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,333
What? Did something happen?
What?

296
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,640
I know this is gonna
be hard to take...

297
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:18,909
But Steve got them
to accept a deal.

298
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,648
If I plead no-contest,
they'll agree to two years...

299
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,815
-No!
-...Eight months.

300
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,350
No, we're fighting this.

301
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,286
If we do, I'm
facing seven years.

302
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,554
If we win this, you face none.

303
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,555
Kate...

304
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:32,590
What?

305
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:35,493
Honey, I blew a point .10.

306
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,029
I ran the red.

307
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,767
I killed tom.

308
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,636
-It was an accident.
It was an accident.

309
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,570
I know.

310
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,606
-I don't care what Steve says.

311
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,608
People don't go
away for accidents!

312
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,513
Jennifer and Tina will
never see tom again.

313
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,982
I'm responsible.

314
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,918
Sixteen months,
it's nothing compared to

315
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,553
what they're going through.

316
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,623
No!

317
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,971
Programmed my number into both.

318
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,007
Erase it from this
one so it's clean.

319
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,582
-Where are we heading?

320
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,118
-East L.A.
Lola's flowers on Beverly.

321
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,428
Any word about last night?

322
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,629
I haven't heard anything yet.

323
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:45,629
And the girl?

324
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:49,567
She'll be okay. Luckily,
the round went through clean.

325
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,001
She solid?

326
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,671
Definitely.
Janie won't say shit.

327
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,542
Put the word out,
anybody ID's me at that party,

328
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,710
they're green-lit.

329
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,579
Roger that.

330
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,163
Can I help you?

331
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,065
I'm looking
for Herman Gomez.

332
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,068
Orale.

333
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,637
It's been a long time, man.

334
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,740
It sure has.

335
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,810
Here you go, baby. We're
gonna be in the back, okay?

336
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,779
Call me if you need me.

337
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,419
I hate those pinches
coolers, man.

338
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,754
Fucking hate them.

339
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,190
In and out all
day from the cold.

340
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,559
Makes my bones hurt.

341
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,728
Have a seat.

342
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,765
You have a beautiful family.

343
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,834
Thank you, homes.
Appreciate it.

344
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,737
What about you?
You got a lady, got kids?

345
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,138
Used to.

346
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,176
The world went on
without us, huh?

347
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,512
Feel for you, homes.
I do.

348
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,649
Spent 17 years total inside.
What a fucking waste.

349
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,858
You know why I asked the
beast for you to handle this?

350
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,793
You asked for me?

351
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,094
Simón.

352
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,164
To me, a man is only
defined by his actions.

353
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,166
Appreciate it.

354
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,036
I'm the one who's
gotta be grateful.

355
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,839
Youngster out there,
he's the one with the guns?

356
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,006
No.

357
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,975
Your friends set the location?

358
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,511
Midnight.
Pretty close to the salton sea.

359
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,247
We're gonna get exact
coordinates one hour before.

360
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,224
We both need this to go smooth.

361
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,926
It will.

362
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,097
Can't wait for
this cheese steak.

363
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,833
Used to come here a lot?

364
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,836
It's a short walk
from my office.

365
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,274
Sorry, but I just can't
picture you in a suit.

366
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,243
All Gordon gekko and shit.

367
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:15,279
You were probably
what, 12 back then?

368
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,747
-About that.

369
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,522
Where you from?

370
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,224
Small farm town, Pennsylvania.

371
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,093
Boring as hell.

372
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,296
So, you know, when
i came back...

373
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:35,199
I decided to come out here
and check out the beach.

374
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,536
How did you come
across the guns?

375
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,070
Sheer luck.

376
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,806
Dod was shipping plane-loads
of them to arm the

377
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:47,044
Afghan security forces
but thousands went missing.

378
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,182
Anyway, one night, my
unit hit a Taliban house.

379
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:55,119
I was clearing a back
room, found a trap door...

380
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,922
Boom.

381
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:01,225
Whole cache of aks and glocks
were down in a hidden tunnel.

382
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:01,225
All of them?

383
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,061
Yeah.
They just piled them in there.

384
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,730
So I sealed it up,
didn't tell my C.O.

385
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:12,136
Fucking muj's, they'd just
used them against us anyway.

386
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,907
So I found these contractor
dudes who agreed to load them

387
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,276
in a container heading
back to the states.

388
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,745
Cost me a hundred of the
aks---wait, wait.

389
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,615
You're telling me
there's just 900 now.

390
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,953
No.
There was 11 hundred to start.

391
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:32,723
I figured a hundred was pretty
cheap to get them home but

392
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,659
then again we're talking about
Soviet factory full-autos,

393
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,629
not that cheap-ass Chinese
knock-off bullshit.

394
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,939
He said he needed
to see you, money.

395
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,814
Fucking knucklehead
skins from the party, man.

396
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,616
I said to them,
i said, lay the fuck low.

397
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,050
They didn't listen to me, okay?
They've been butting heads

398
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,785
with these fucking
crippers from the beach.

399
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:01,785
Those toads, they
knew that house.

400
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,788
So you're telling
me it was a drive-by.

401
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,256
I'm just telling
you what I told them--

402
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,392
it sure didn't feel random,
that gun aimed at my face.

403
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,661
Hey, look, it's on me.
This is fucking on me.

404
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:10,661
But I'm gonna fucking hit them.

405
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:10,661
I'm gonna check their fucking
asses, I'm gonna find out who

406
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:14,999
took those shots and I'm
gonna fucking hit them.

407
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:14,999
Not until the deal's done.

408
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,835
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm on it.

409
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,905
Man, I know you like
the fucking kid.

410
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,374
I like the kid, too, man.

411
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:25,376
I mean, gi Joe over there
in fucking Afghanistan.

412
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:26,877
But that's not
where we are, is it?

413
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,912
You know who I am.
You know what I'm about.

414
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,115
Now, I need to be with you. I
need to be on your fucking hip--

415
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:34,218
you know I can't be seen
around anyone validated.

416
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:39,056
Like I'm doing right now
in broad fucking daylight!

417
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,760
Now, you get everyone in check.

418
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,796
We got too much on the
line for any more bullshit!

419
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,734
Just be careful.

420
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,305
Fuck me!

421
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,150
You were told to answer
to nobody but me.

422
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,918
I'm sorry--
-shut your hole!

423
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,921
Look at me.

424
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,859
Everything you do in this
game has a consequence.

425
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,064
If you defied my
order like that inside,

426
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,965
I'd make you fucking bleed.

427
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,835
I will walk the walk, money.

428
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,170
I swear.

429
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,239
Damn right you will.

430
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,711
Open east gate.

431
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,305
High security first!

432
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,875
Look, man,
i know you're scared. All right?

433
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,811
I would be scared.
But you need to know this-

434
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,147
all violent crimes,
from domestic

435
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,816
battery to capital murder,
get housed together.

436
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,353
It means you'll be
with the big boys...

437
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,057
And they will test you,
whether you like it or not.

438
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,792
The rest
of you, single file.

439
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,328
So you gotta
stand up for yourself...

440
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,797
Because once you're
marked in there...

441
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,166
It will never end.

442
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,798
Yo, bring that in!

443
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,332
This the real place.

444
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,867
This the real place, yo!

445
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,236
You gonna roll with us or not?

446
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,204
Best check yourself, peckerwood!

447
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,574
Looks like some lame
just stepped on a land mine.

448
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,143
-Yo, motherfucker, move!

449
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,445
I'm fucking about
to boot your ass!

450
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,350
Get down! Get down!
Now, get down!

451
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,385
Get the fuck down right now!
Everybody down!

452
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,487
All right, break it up!
Get off him!

453
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,290
Get on the ground!

454
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,625
Spray 'em!

455
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,265
Stay down. Stay down.
Just breathe.

456
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,236
Fish has heart.

457
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,174
Get on the wall.

458
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,348
Step in.

459
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,522
You throw any piss or shit...

460
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,459
I'll leave you in here
for the whole 30, no rec.

461
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,195
Leave your dirties by the door.

462
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,551
Turn around.

463
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,664
No new inks since your release?

464
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,402
Thought I might
find a shamrock or ab.

465
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:01,038
Only a select few
can wear that ink.

466
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,306
I see.

467
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,677
Get dressed.

468
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,781
Need you to clear something up.

469
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,785
Girl got shot last night
out in south bay...

470
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,454
And someone reported
you were there.

471
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:19,790
Then they got it wrong.

472
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,526
I need an alibi.

473
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:25,228
Got a room at the easy
stay motel near downtown,

474
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,596
till I find an apartment.

475
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,236
Says here you checked
in at 6:35 P.M.

476
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,273
But the shooting
was after midnight.

477
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,209
That's all I got.
Paid cash with the rest

478
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,711
of my gate money for a
steak dinner at sizzler's.

479
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,613
Hit the bunk after that.

480
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,582
Not much of an alibi.

481
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,784
Not much putting me
at the scene either.

482
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,853
I figure you'd already be
giving me a one year bullet

483
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,621
for breaking parole.

484
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,158
Don't think I won't.

485
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,295
When do I report in again?

486
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,496
You don't.

487
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,765
I check in on you.

488
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,767
Got a cell phone yet?

489
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,469
I wrote the number
down on the form.

490
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,403
Good.

491
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,605
Thank you.

492
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,222
Wood.

493
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,524
Come with me.

494
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,633
The man you're about to meet
has the keys to this yard.

495
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,568
Treat him with respect.

496
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,177
I'm bottles.

497
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,646
Jacob.

498
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,581
Yeah, the stock
broker from Pasadena.

499
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,854
When you come to yard, chow,
you take a shit, whatever...

500
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,623
You stick to your own race.

501
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,892
Why did you fight that toad?

502
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:02,692
He challenged me first.

503
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,529
You gonna go around kicking
it off with every buster

504
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:05,529
that calls you out?

505
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,498
I'm not looking for trouble, no.

506
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,434
But I'm not taking
any shit either.

507
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,439
The only thing we got
in here is our respect.

508
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,341
The question is, what you gonna
do when you're out here slumming

509
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,177
it with the rest of us?

510
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,580
Cause the safety of these
numbers comes with a price.

511
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,916
There are no free rides here.

512
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:27,918
Everyone puts in work,
whether cliqued up or not.

513
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:27,918
I understand.

514
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,555
I'm not talking about helping
us with our computer skills.

515
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,959
You'll get your fucking hands
dirty like the rest of us.

516
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,428
Or you can go back to seeing
how that lone bullshit works

517
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,663
out for you, money man.

518
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,713
Hey.

519
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,981
-Hi.

520
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,255
Joshua made you a letter...

521
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:08,425
And he's very excited
for you to read it.

522
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,794
He did it all by himself, and...

523
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:15,498
I wanted to give it to you, but
some guard up front took it.

524
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,501
I know, I know, but
they'll get it back to me.

525
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:19,502
Good.

526
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,904
Can't wait to read it.

527
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,473
I think you'll like it.

528
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,642
How is he?

529
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,314
-Ehm...

530
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,749
He's really good.

531
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,689
Sorry.

532
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,394
-It's okay.

533
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,498
It's good to see you.

534
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,903
Kate, something's wrong.
What is it?

535
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,576
Ehm, Jennifer's suing
us for wrongful death.

536
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,013
I mean, I...

537
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,484
I don't know what to
do with that, but...

538
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,787
How much is in our checking?

539
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,423
Three months, maybe.

540
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:16,293
I called Lynn, 'cause I'm
gonna get my job back.

541
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:20,463
No. No, you're not quitting
school when you're this close.

542
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,765
I don't have a choice.

543
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,034
I have to pay
bills, Jacob, so...

544
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,902
Look, it'll take her at least
six months to get a court

545
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,905
date and we have
some equity on the house.

546
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,373
Yes.

547
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,442
Use our equity line while
we put it on the market.

548
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,311
I'm not selling our home.
I'm not.

549
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,513
It's just a house, Kate.

550
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,081
It'll help stretch things
long enough for you to

551
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,450
get your design license,
and that's what matters.

552
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:40,450
It's our home.

553
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:44,321
Your life is not
stopping because of this.

554
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,559
You promise me.

555
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:51,928
Yeah?

556
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,031
Yeah.

557
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,734
Thank you.

558
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,986
Kate?

559
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,389
Shit.

560
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,758
Jacob.

561
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,369
Must feel good to be out...

562
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,105
I would imagine.

563
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,808
Drove by old house and...

564
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,878
Doesn't look much different,
to tell you the truth.

565
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,448
So, where are you working?

566
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,985
I'm working in a legal firm.

567
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,887
It's a...

568
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,789
I'm a paralegal.

569
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,991
Ever think about pushing your
interior designing again?

570
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,061
No.

571
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,499
No, there's no time for that.

572
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,502
You know, it's just between
work and being a mom, it's...

573
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,171
It's fine.
It is what it is.

574
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,747
Why'd you send him that letter?

575
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,550
Josh thought you were
committing suicide.

576
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,092
This is for you.

577
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,196
They're signature cards
to your new checking.

578
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,031
Have them notarized,
then get them back to me.

579
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,699
You're not gonna
answer my question?

580
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,701
There's 178 grand in there.

581
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:41,538
I don't know how you got that
money, and I don't care.

582
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,706
You need to keep that.
I'm not taking it.

583
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,707
No, it's yours now.

584
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:45,708
I'm not taking
your gang money!

585
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:45,708
Just keep it down.

586
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,179
Don't tell me what to do.
You don't get to do that.

587
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,582
I don't hear from
you for seven years.

588
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,851
Nothing!

589
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,821
I mean, how do you
even now where I live?

590
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,096
I'm not trying
anything here, Kate.

591
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:09,065
The money's clean.

592
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,101
I just couldn't get it
to you until I was out.

593
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,004
Okay. What is this?

594
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,474
Is this my consolation prize?

595
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,210
Give it to Josh then.
Whatever you want--

596
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:23,513
you give it to Josh.
He deserves a dad.

597
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,582
I wrote him that letter...

598
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,918
Because I won't let my stink
affect him another day.

599
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,821
He deserves better.

600
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,658
And you deserve better.

601
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,830
Once that's handled, it'll
be the last time you see me.

602
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,792
Your order from the canteen?

603
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,622
There's gonna be
a balloon in your canteen.

604
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,558
You're responsible for it.

605
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,061
What do I do with it?

606
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,763
Take it to yard tomorrow.

607
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:48,231
How?

608
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,899
In your fucking ass, man.

609
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,735
Make sure you lube-up, too.

610
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,904
You don't want this shit
breaking off inside you.

611
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,741
The fuck you looking
at the floor for?

612
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,145
Is there a problem?
Hm?

613
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:04,647
I get it. You think
you're bad ass 'cause you

614
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,783
put your tips on
some fucking toad?

615
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:09,018
Maybe I should get you
transferred into my side.

616
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,020
I got a open door policy, bro.

617
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,723
Find out how a white boy fights.
Would you like to find that out?

618
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:14,958
We don't have a problem.

619
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,593
No problem?
-No.

620
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,416
No loitering, jinkins.
Let's go.

621
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:48,017
Just keeping
good hygiene, sir.

622
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:26,155
Keep putting it in
that work, money man.

623
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,450
Fuck out of the way, man.
Don't you see me fucking coming?

624
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,218
Fuck out of the way.

625
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,578
We'll get the location
from the eses tomorrow

626
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,514
night an hour before.
We got a problem here?

627
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,852
No, man, there's no problem.

628
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,522
No, it's just that's not
a lot of time, you know.

629
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,391
We have no idea what
we're walking into.

630
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,393
I'm just trying to
protect you, that's all.

631
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:12,228
Shit, man, you got it.
You got it, bro.

632
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,596
I'm here for you, man.

633
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,832
I'm good.

634
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,339
Stash still out in the I.E.?

635
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,475
Moreno valley.
A storage unit.

636
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,144
Anybody check it lately?

637
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,413
I was out there yesterday.
It's good.

638
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:33,583
Yeah. Shotgun knows
the on-site manager.

639
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,621
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's
good, it's good. He's gonna

640
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,990
cut the camera as soon as we
drive in. I'm on that shit.

641
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:42,391
Let's keep vehicles
to a minimum.

642
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:45,228
Just the moving truck and
a scout. Who's cleanest?

643
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,496
Horvath. He's been
off parole for two years.

644
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:50,266
You're scout. The rest of us
will load up in the truck.

645
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,001
You know what's riding on this.

646
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,237
Now, go home, lay low.

647
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,285
Get a ride with chopper.

648
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:10,419
Sure.

649
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:24,527
I tried, man. He's not giving up
the exchange. He said he's gonna

650
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,629
let us know an hour before,
that's what he said. I tried.

651
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,131
I done everything you
asked me to do, man.

652
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,567
Cool.

653
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,736
Then you wear a wire.

654
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,571
You can't ask me to
wear a fucking wire!

655
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:35,571
Don't come to me with that!

656
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:37,707
How you want me
to come at you?

657
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:39,041
That means I'm a
fucking dead man!

658
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,376
If I'm a dead man,
you ain't got shit!

659
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:43,446
You chose this. So, unless
you produce, Monica stays

660
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:45,715
locked up for trafficking,
and you're next.

661
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,618
I'm trying to
help you out, man.

662
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,753
And I'm here.

663
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,622
I'm fucking here, man.
I'm fucking here.

664
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,391
I done everything
you asked me to do.

665
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:57,026
I can't help it if
he ain't giving me shit--

666
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,561
and I can't help you
and your old lady if you

667
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:00,029
don't give me shit.
It's simple.

668
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,465
It's simple.

669
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,267
What do you suggest
i do, frank, huh?

670
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,571
You tracking my phone, right?

671
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:10,639
Just do the phone thing, man.

672
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,776
Just do the phone thing.

673
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,087
Frank, listen to me.

674
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:27,790
I'm gonna say it
one time, all right?

675
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:31,160
If your fucking cell phone
loses its signal even for a

676
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,762
millisecond- be quiet.

677
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:36,298
Then I'm kicking your
trafficking charges up to DEA.

678
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,701
All my friends there gonna
take care of you and Monica

679
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,404
real well. Fair time.
You know what that means?

680
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:44,240
A fucking mandatory
twenty right off the top.

681
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,076
It's the position
you're putting me in.

682
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,578
All right?

683
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,080
-Yeah.

684
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:52,048
Can I ask you something?

685
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,249
What, frank?

686
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:56,285
I deliver, she comes home.
I want your word.

687
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:57,520
Yeah.

688
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,688
I want your word, man.

689
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,091
I said, yeah.

690
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,360
You got my word.

691
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:06,095
Look, man, she's
my life, okay?

692
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,731
She's my fucking life, man.

693
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,666
Ball's in your court, frank.

694
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,170
Catch you later, frank.

695
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,946
It's your turn,
money man.

696
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,917
I know you're shitting
bricks right about now.

697
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:10,419
Trying to rationalize
the morality.

698
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:12,321
What will your
family think of you?

699
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:14,690
How will they judge you?
All of that went through

700
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,259
my head, too,
when I first broke my cherry.

701
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:19,628
And then I realized
none of that matters.

702
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,499
The only thing that matters
is you getting home to

703
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,267
your family in one piece.

704
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,671
This guy's a monster, brother.
Make sure you're with me.

705
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:30,906
How can they know
he's really snitching?

706
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:30,906
Doesn't matter!

707
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:34,877
If we leave him breathing,
they'll whack us, okay?

708
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,885
All right, they're popping 'em.
It's time.

709
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:47,656
Come here! Come here!
We're doing this!

710
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,628
All right, before
he hits the tier.

711
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,726
Get him!

712
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,547
-The fact is we all
started out as someone's

713
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,016
little angel.

714
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:56,659
And a place like this forces us
to become warriors or victims.

715
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:03,399
Nothing in between
can exist here.

716
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,849
And you've chosen
to be a warrior.

717
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,954
Now it's up to
you to remain one.

718
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,800
Did you get it notarized?

719
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,903
Uhm yes. Yes, I did.

720
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,619
I told you not
to bring him here.

721
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,955
I know, but he wanted
to be here, so...

722
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,929
I'm gonna stay by the car, okay?

723
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,431
Okay.

724
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,009
Look...

725
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,413
I meant every word
in that letter, so...

726
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,515
I don't have much else to say.

727
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,755
You know, I used to love
getting your letters.

728
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,658
I reread them like
a dozen times.

729
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,195
And then nothing from you
for the past seven years.

730
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,064
And then I get this one.

731
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,669
Even when you knew you were
getting out, you still want

732
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:21,804
nothing to do with your son.

733
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:22,938
It's not that.

734
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,042
Some things just don't
go back together again.

735
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:27,042
They just don't.

736
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:33,015
You, your mom, are on
your own trajectory now.

737
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:34,650
I'm on another one.

738
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,552
What, just wasting the
rest of your life, dad?

739
00:57:36,554 --> 00:57:38,220
It doesn't matter what I do!

740
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:43,525
Your job is to take care
of yourself and your mom.

741
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:46,628
Look, I get why
you pushed us away.

742
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,898
It was to protect us.

743
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,902
But, dad, you've
done your time now.

744
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,038
It's over.

745
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:59,041
Let us help you get
back on your feet.

746
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,643
Please.

747
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,581
You wanna help me?

748
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:06,081
Yeah, I do.

749
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,720
Then stay away.

750
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,258
You're a fucking loser!

751
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,563
Just get in the car.

752
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:23,966
Oohh...

753
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:14,109
What can I get you today?

754
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,777
An order of pancakes...

755
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,080
Scrambled eggs and bacon,
and a cup of coffee, please.

756
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:19,114
All right.

757
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,916
-Same for me.
-Okay.

758
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:22,751
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Please and thank you.

759
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,987
I need another car.

760
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:26,722
Janie's Nissan's out front.

761
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:28,323
It's a piece of
shit, but it's clean.

762
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,759
Did my truck break down?

763
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,928
No. We'll pick it up tomorrow.

764
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,297
Get me shotgun's address.

765
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,199
I'll pick him up myself.

766
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,001
Will do.

767
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,774
How did you meet shotgun?

768
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,346
Did I do something wrong, money?

769
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,816
Just never told me.

770
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:04,259
A guy from my unit, he's
from huntington beach.

771
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,663
We were real tight.

772
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,231
Yeah.

773
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,935
All he talked about was this
skinhead gang he was with

774
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:15,337
and surfing.

775
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,305
Man...

776
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:20,175
He was gonna teach me
when he got back, but...

777
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,745
He got blown up.

778
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,685
When I went to the
funeral, I met Janie.

779
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:32,187
She's his sister. I told
her about the guns because

780
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,423
her brother and i
were gonna sell them.

781
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:36,825
We were supposed to
sell them together.

782
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,894
And she introduced
me to shotgun.

783
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,063
-Two coffees.

784
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,372
So shotgun...

785
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,476
He's jumping you in for this.

786
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:01,049
I don't wanna be
a part of a gang.

787
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,229
Who's with bottles?

788
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:20,302
-Herman Gomez. He's got the
keys to the yard for the eses.

789
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:23,872
His old man's royalty, bro.
Fucking ogma.

790
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:26,475
Herman's solid, solid as fuck.

791
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:29,244
You make sure you treat him
like he's one of our own.

792
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,249
Word already came
down from the beast.

793
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:37,119
Eses kicking off
with the toads, bro.

794
01:02:37,121 --> 01:02:39,921
I'm fucking going with them.
Fucking live for this shit.

795
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,823
-I heard that, brother.
-Fuck, yeah.

796
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,394
Damn,
i can't be part of a riot.

797
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:48,230
Don't expect a
hall pass, brother.

798
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,799
Whole wood pile's
expected to get down.

799
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,006
Just don't go anywhere the cops
or cameras can single you out.

800
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,809
Stay in the middle,
keep swinging on dudes.

801
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:02,778
Unless there's something
obvious, they'll just put us on

802
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,379
lockdown like they always do.

803
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,082
Then you're home free.

804
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:39,915
Iron up.

805
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,558
Fuck these busters
and these blacks homies!

806
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,394
Go! Earn your ink!

807
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:29,531
Oh, shit!

808
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,099
They're moving! It's on!

809
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,370
Come on.

810
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,406
Aahh!!

811
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,698
Get down!
Get down! Get down!

812
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,535
Stay down or I will shoot you!

813
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:15,704
I fucking owe you one.

814
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:18,740
-Nobody get up!
Stay where you are!

815
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:54,509
Please rise.

816
01:06:57,546 --> 01:07:00,448
Mr. harlon, with this
court finding you guilty of

817
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,784
assault by a prisoner
with a deadly weapon

818
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:05,453
I'm sentencing you to the
middle term of four years.

819
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:09,124
In addition, having been found
guilty of committing this crime

820
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:11,526
in association and for
the benefit of a gang,

821
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:14,229
I'm sentencing you to an
additional five years to

822
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:18,500
run consecutively. Penal
code 667.5 requires that you

823
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:22,270
serve a minimum of 85
percent of these terms.

824
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:25,140
Both will run concurrently
with your initial sentence.

825
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:35,450
It's over.
Forget I exist.

826
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,761
You'll be locked
down 23/7 in the security

827
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:48,696
housing unit with
one hour yard time.

828
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:50,598
Three showers a week.
You will not be allowed in the

829
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,468
same open area as any other
inmate, outside your cellie.

830
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,403
And there will be
no warning shots.

831
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:57,705
You cliqued up with anyone?

832
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:58,606
No.

833
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:00,408
Why participate in the riot?

834
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,776
You know why.

835
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,413
You got your rules and
we got the gang's rules.

836
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:07,682
And theirs matter.

837
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,722
Yeah, well, it cost you
a year of good time on top of

838
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:17,659
the new sentences and put you
with the heavy hitters, so...

839
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,196
I hope it was worth it.

840
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,231
You know the deal,
ripper. Face the wall.

841
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,571
Crack 13.

842
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,746
Close 13.

843
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,185
Hands through the food port.

844
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:57,699
You can get up, ripper.

845
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,542
Welcome to the pad, money.
I'm ripper.

846
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,546
Who's got the keys here?

847
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,148
Redwood, from the brand.

848
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,653
Open forward yard door.

849
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,442
Redwood, this is money.

850
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,284
Heard how you got down at chino.

851
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:58,620
So did the beast.

852
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:01,956
Appreciate it.
He still in the hole?

853
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,425
Four hundred yards to my six.

854
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,427
Less nine years.

855
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,965
Little different than
the mainline, huh?

856
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,601
You could say that.

857
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:17,438
Make no mistake, brother,
they design places like

858
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,641
this to break men like us.

859
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,815
Eses and woods.

860
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,485
500 Navy seals.
Ripper, count 'em.

861
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:31,486
Ready!

862
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:33,521
Down!

863
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:35,757
One, two, three!

864
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:37,525
One!

865
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:38,626
Down!

866
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,062
One, two, three!

867
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:42,530
Two!

868
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:43,631
Down!

869
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,967
One, two, three!

870
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:47,669
Three!

871
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:48,836
Down!

872
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:51,072
One, two, three!

873
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:52,740
Four!

874
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,345
Whassup?

875
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:00,615
Thought you were
posting up on your ci.

876
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:02,483
-Since three A.M.

877
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,086
Figured I'd get some
chow and take a piss.

878
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,522
Any movement?

879
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:10,358
-Nada. You know, I can't
put my finger on it, Manny,

880
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,094
but there's more
to this harlon guy.

881
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:15,063
What you mean,
like a power play?

882
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:18,866
Phil says his wife and
his kid show up to his motel,

883
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:18,866
slams the door in their face.

884
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,838
I mean, you talking about a guy
with a perfect life, all right?

885
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,374
A fucking envious life.

886
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,810
He's got not one prior.

887
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:31,012
Can't even fucking spell
the word gangster, man.

888
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,881
He gets fucked up on a dui
manslaughter, kills his friend.

889
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,384
Yeah, a dime will change you for
sure, but a guy like that...

890
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:38,052
Gets out, throws
everything away?

891
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:38,052
No.

892
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:41,823
Look, all I know is, once a
dude gets institutionalized,

893
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,558
anything is possible, man.

894
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:46,594
What you got?

895
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:48,363
Still squat on the eses.

896
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:52,834
But atf did pick up a call
from Mexico on the wiretap.

897
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:55,803
Something about picking up
guns near the salton sea.

898
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,706
So at least we
know the area now.

899
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,007
Who's the tap on?

900
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:03,711
Heavy hitter from
the sonora cartel.

901
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:07,115
And of course atf wants
any and all intel we got.

902
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:09,917
Sonora, huh?

903
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:10,551
Yeah.

904
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:14,522
This thing just keeps on
getting bigger and bigger.

905
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,793
Maybe it's not a bad idea to
have atf out there with us.

906
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:24,699
Hey, you know what,
check it out, bro.

907
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,535
Why don't you just quarterback
this one from the office?

908
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:29,971
I mean, shit, what's it been,
a week since the shooting?

909
01:13:29,973 --> 01:13:32,640
Sit around with a thumb up my
ass? Come on, you kidding me?

910
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,942
That's worse, man.

911
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,682
Sure as hell have seen my
share of violence, man,

912
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:43,684
but when you're in it...

913
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,587
When you're on the other end...

914
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,793
That's a whole different
ball game, brother.

915
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:59,700
Look, man, I've never been in
an actual gunfight myself...

916
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:01,836
So I'm not gonna sit here and
tell you I know what you're

917
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:03,671
going through, because I don't.

918
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,141
But what I do know is that
there's a young girl out there

919
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:08,976
who's safe right now.

920
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,846
And that's because of you.

921
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,671
Goddamn, man.
It sucks.

922
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:38,873
It's good.

923
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,042
I want her to move on.

924
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:01,028
Shit!
Get him on the ground!

925
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,798
Get him, money!
-Get down!

926
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,000
On the yard. One on one.
Enemy combat. Enemy combat.

927
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,804
Fuck that norteño up,
homie! Get him!

928
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,810
Money!
Money, let him go!

929
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,144
Rip that farmer's head off!

930
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,513
-Spray him!

931
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,548
Get down! Get down now!

932
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:32,760
One!

933
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,530
Two!

934
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:37,198
Three!

935
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,667
Hey.

936
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:42,069
Your counselor wants to see you.

937
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,977
Since when do you escort alone?

938
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,812
Why, you gonna be a problem?

939
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,581
No, sir.

940
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,042
Know who I am?

941
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,778
Yes.

942
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:26,080
They sent redwood to death
row after what happened.

943
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,652
It took him four months to
finally get that screw.

944
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:33,754
Fuck 'em.

945
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:36,357
These cops...

946
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,794
They need to understand...

947
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,063
That we run the show.

948
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:45,232
Some get it.

949
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:47,868
Like Roberts.

950
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,207
But the rest think the
more they lock us down...

951
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,276
And isolate us...

952
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,713
It strips us of our power.

953
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,016
They even think we
closed the books.

954
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,652
We're a dying breed.

955
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,755
They're dead fucking wrong.

956
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:10,891
We're just real selective...

957
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,095
Who we choose to
call our brother.

958
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:17,932
So the question is...

959
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:22,269
Are you ready?

960
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,243
Yes.

961
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,781
What I wanted to hear.

962
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:37,318
But keep your ink clean so
they can't validate you.

963
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,887
That's how we lull
the enemy to sleep.

964
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,956
I understand.

965
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,392
You have the keys out here now.

966
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:46,927
Roberts will single-cell you.

967
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:48,896
Get you some privacy.

968
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,065
Works for me.

969
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,334
You like to read?

970
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,003
I got a good collection
on psychology.

971
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:59,440
Just finished reading
the human animal.

972
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,277
I'll send it over with
some of my favorites.

973
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,882
A warrior's deadliest weapon...

974
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:11,285
Is his mind.

975
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,090
Welcome to the family, brother.

976
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,384
Mr. harlon,

977
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:53,154
after serving 85
percent of your time...

978
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,357
Having a clean conduct record
with no infractions...

979
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:59,360
I recommend to the parole
board your release...

980
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:00,995
30 days from today.

981
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:04,899
This is your parole packet.

982
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:06,433
Tells you who to report to.

983
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:10,204
Thank you.

984
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:43,337
Push send.
And I'll be back for it in 30.

985
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,592
You know shotgun?

986
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,295
He just sent word to me about
a heavy shipment of guns

987
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:10,497
a youngster smuggled
back from Afghanistan.

988
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:12,600
He wants permission to go
to Herman Gomez to offload

989
01:21:12,602 --> 01:21:15,536
them for a million five
to their cartel connections.

990
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,137
Herman got his letters?

991
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:18,472
And he's out, too.

992
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:21,075
Just like you'll be in 30 days.

993
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:25,045
I'll get word to Herman you're
handling the deal for us.

994
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:27,014
And fuck our usual cut.

995
01:21:27,016 --> 01:21:29,250
Shotgun just bought himself
a full partner on this.

996
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:29,250
I'll be on parole though.

997
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:31,518
The fuck's that got
to do with anything?

998
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,953
Well, 10 years--

999
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:34,655
you think the fucking
honor of being one of us

1000
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:37,491
ends at the gates? It ends
when you're six feet under.

1001
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:39,894
Until then, you will keep
earning for your brothers.

1002
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:39,894
I understand that--

1003
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:43,330
before you say
another fucking word...

1004
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:45,566
Think of your family
in this decision.

1005
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:47,401
Excuse me?

1006
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,403
Did I stutter?

1007
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:59,113
I'll get word to shotgun,

1008
01:21:59,115 --> 01:22:00,948
tell him shit's on
hold until I'm out.

1009
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,217
Good answer.

1010
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:56,971
Who is?

1011
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:59,239
It's money.
Open the door.

1012
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,562
Howie's been calling you
all day. What the fuck?

1013
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,764
Let's go!

1014
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,101
The fuck you mean
he's been calling?

1015
01:23:27,103 --> 01:23:28,302
He ain't been
calling- oh, fuck!

1016
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:31,672
Aaahhh!!

1017
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,540
Fuck!

1018
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:49,590
What you tell kutcher?

1019
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,561
Does Herman know you're a rat?

1020
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:56,530
Fucking stupid motherfucker!

1021
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,732
Herman's the one who tried
to kill you, you fuck!

1022
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:02,469
No, you both did, or his crew
wouldn't have known I was there.

1023
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,344
Go on and do what you gotta do.

1024
01:24:10,346 --> 01:24:12,279
Go ahead.

1025
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:14,081
Go on and fucking do it.

1026
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,785
Come on, fucking do it!

1027
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:38,272
I ain't a-i ain't no punk.

1028
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:12,439
Yeah. Anything?

1029
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:15,576
Nothing.
It's almost four o'clock, too.

1030
01:25:15,578 --> 01:25:17,377
All right, I'll
check in on shotgun.

1031
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:19,847
There's no need to tip harlon
off if we don't have to.

1032
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:22,516
-Okay, standing by.
-Copy that.

1033
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:11,632
Frank, it's kutcher!

1034
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:16,203
Frank!

1035
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,417
Fuck!

1036
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,555
Get in that room now.

1037
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:20,734
Fuck!

1038
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:25,505
Yeah.

1039
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:28,609
Yeah, he left his cell
here, but he's fucking gone.

1040
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:32,813
Hang on a minute.
Hang on.

1041
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:39,720
Hang on.

1042
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:50,330
Somebody in this deal thinks
shotgun's still alive, man.

1043
01:27:50,332 --> 01:27:51,999
He texted them the
coordinates at 11:00.

1044
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:16,083
Still can't track the
incoming calls to shotgun's.

1045
01:29:16,085 --> 01:29:17,718
Must be off.

1046
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,920
Fucking text better come
through, or we're screwed.

1047
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,896
Where's shotgun?

1048
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:05,632
You tell me. Went to pick him
up, he's a fucking no-show!

1049
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:06,466
I'll call him.

1050
01:30:06,468 --> 01:30:08,969
Yeah, you do that.
I can't do babysitting.

1051
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:10,504
Let's go. Give me the key.

1052
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:20,480
That's shotgun's.

1053
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,484
It's a different number. 714.

1054
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:46,873
Look at the Russian
serial numbers.

1055
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:50,143
And the glocks from
Austria, not the U.S.

1056
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,048
Totally untraceable.

1057
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:55,982
Nice.

1058
01:30:55,984 --> 01:30:57,918
Shotgun's still not answering.

1059
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:03,990
Pull your cell batteries,
in case he got pinched.

1060
01:31:03,992 --> 01:31:06,726
You two, you ride in the back,
since you're both validated.

1061
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:07,861
Let's load up.

1062
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:28,081
Well, our ci's dead.

1063
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:31,251
Harlon's fucking Mia.
How was your day?

1064
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:34,855
All right, so what do you wanna
do, hit the Indian casinos

1065
01:31:34,857 --> 01:31:37,023
or what, you got a plan b?

1066
01:31:37,025 --> 01:31:39,059
Because atf ain't
heard shit either.

1067
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:42,863
A different cell called our
cis, what, two hours ago?

1068
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:45,832
We located it in moreno valley,
then it fucking disappeared too.

1069
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:47,767
Cockroaches are making moves.

1070
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,912
Horvath caught back-up.

1071
01:31:58,914 --> 01:32:00,213
He's right behind us.

1072
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:02,249
What time is it now?

1073
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:06,119
Eight minutes to eleven.

1074
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:20,133
Yo, we're in business! Yo!

1075
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:24,237
The original incoming cell just
passed palm desert on the 10.

1076
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,039
It's 10:54 now.

1077
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:28,275
If we can just get the exact
location, we can set up on them.

1078
01:32:36,984 --> 01:32:38,018
Here.

1079
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:48,028
About five miles out.

1080
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:01,841
Got it.

1081
01:33:01,843 --> 01:33:04,878
Let's go, we got the
coordinates! Let's ride out!

1082
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:06,947
All right, load up!

1083
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,654
It's half a mile up that way.

1084
01:33:14,656 --> 01:33:16,790
All right, turn in and stop.

1085
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:31,771
Turn your cell back
on, post up out here.

1086
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:33,206
Text me if you see anything.

1087
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:34,641
Will do.

1088
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,361
Let me see your gun.

1089
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:01,201
Keep driving.

1090
01:34:01,203 --> 01:34:03,703
What! What's wrong, money?

1091
01:34:03,705 --> 01:34:06,172
How many guns did you tell
shotgun you had total?

1092
01:34:06,174 --> 01:34:07,874
Same as I told you!

1093
01:34:07,876 --> 01:34:09,943
You lie to me again, I'll
blow your fucking head off!

1094
01:34:09,945 --> 01:34:11,177
How many?

1095
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:14,914
Two. Two thousand aks.

1096
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:18,284
Shotgun, right before
i met you, shotgun said

1097
01:34:18,286 --> 01:34:20,887
that if I said anything
about the extra guns,

1098
01:34:20,889 --> 01:34:23,156
he'd green-light me,
money. You gotta believe me.

1099
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,324
Where are they?

1100
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:26,159
Shotgun's dead, isn't he?

1101
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:28,228
Answer the fucking question.

1102
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:32,399
Second storage unit, number 246.

1103
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:35,935
Does chopper or the others know?

1104
01:34:35,937 --> 01:34:38,905
No. Shotgun and
i went out alone.

1105
01:34:57,892 --> 01:34:59,759
This is what you're gonna do.

1106
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:03,196
You're gonna forget
they're there...

1107
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:06,766
And you're gonna fucking vanish.

1108
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:10,336
Re-enlist, I don't
care what you do.

1109
01:35:11,405 --> 01:35:14,741
But if I ever hear
your name again...

1110
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:17,077
There won't be
anywhere you can hide.

1111
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:19,379
Do you understand me?
Do you understand?

1112
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:21,281
Yes. Yes.

1113
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,186
Jump.

1114
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:29,923
-But--
-open the door and jump.

1115
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:46,566
Where's Howie?

1116
01:36:46,568 --> 01:36:50,036
Dropped him off strapped quarter
mile back. Watch our six.

1117
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:52,572
Keep your eyes open.

1118
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:06,085
That's them.

1119
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:12,859
Looking for shotgun?

1120
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:16,429
I know it was only business.

1121
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:19,365
Just pick a better
shooter next time.

1122
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:21,000
Orale.

1123
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:24,370
You should'a seen me crack
the whip on those fools.

1124
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:30,343
What you don't know is you
made a deal with a rat.

1125
01:37:31,912 --> 01:37:34,180
He was gonna throw you
under the bus with me.

1126
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,053
Has that been taken care of?

1127
01:37:40,055 --> 01:37:43,189
-And the youngster who
stashed the extra guns.

1128
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:46,059
Don't worry, I know
where they're hidden.

1129
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:52,165
I figure, we make everyone
happy with this deal...

1130
01:37:54,468 --> 01:37:56,502
Then you and I split the rest.

1131
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:04,978
-I'm down with that.

1132
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:26,266
Orale.

1133
01:38:28,469 --> 01:38:30,236
Tienes todas las armas?

1134
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,170
Simón.

1135
01:38:31,672 --> 01:38:34,173
Aj, carga los cohetes.

1136
01:38:35,276 --> 01:38:38,378
Chopper, move the truck around.
You got the money?

1137
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,246
Un millón cinco.

1138
01:38:40,248 --> 01:38:41,347
All right.

1139
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:06,539
Get down! Get down!
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

1140
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:12,412
Fuck, homie!
The flaca's dog!

1141
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:23,289
Hands on your back!
Don't move!

1142
01:39:38,105 --> 01:39:39,272
Drop the weapon!

1143
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,275
He's got a gun!

1144
01:39:43,077 --> 01:39:44,410
Look away look away!!

1145
01:39:44,712 --> 01:39:46,346
Hands behind your back.

1146
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:51,210
We're officially validating you.
Means you'll do the rest of your

1147
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,546
new life term here in the shu-
unless you wanna play ball.

1148
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,681
-Got nothing to play.
-Come on, harlon.

1149
01:40:55,683 --> 01:40:57,050
Don't let your pride
get in the way.

1150
01:40:57,052 --> 01:40:57,050
You don't owe these people--

1151
01:40:57,052 --> 01:41:00,420
-save the speech.
We're done here.

1152
01:41:17,538 --> 01:41:20,073
What happens when we put you in
death row with all the low-lifes

1153
01:41:20,075 --> 01:41:21,674
for murdering shotgun?

1154
01:41:21,676 --> 01:41:23,543
Cause when it happens,
and it will...

1155
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:27,180
Whatever offer me and my
guys are willing to make

1156
01:41:27,182 --> 01:41:28,448
goes up in smoke.

1157
01:41:32,152 --> 01:41:33,820
That all you got?

1158
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:35,721
Bluffs?

1159
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:40,793
I already pleaded
guilty to the guns.

1160
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:43,563
Let me do my time like a man.

1161
01:41:43,565 --> 01:41:45,498
You see, that's
what I don't get.

1162
01:41:46,733 --> 01:41:49,102
I've been around long enough
to know when a con's making

1163
01:41:49,104 --> 01:41:51,437
moves simply to survive or
when it's that rare breed...

1164
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:55,341
The one that relishes
in the power.

1165
01:41:55,343 --> 01:41:57,210
But that's not you.

1166
01:41:57,212 --> 01:41:59,479
Not by a long shot.

1167
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:02,115
Why you throwing
your whole life away?

1168
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:08,121
Look, I don't know what
they're holding over you...

1169
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:12,125
But I can offer you
something better.

1170
01:42:12,626 --> 01:42:14,127
Something real.

1171
01:42:15,562 --> 01:42:17,530
No bluffs, no bs.

1172
01:42:19,366 --> 01:42:20,800
You give me the beast...

1173
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:23,703
And everyone involved...

1174
01:42:24,505 --> 01:42:25,771
And you walk.

1175
01:42:29,743 --> 01:42:31,410
I mean it.

1176
01:42:31,412 --> 01:42:33,913
No protective custody,
no reduced sentence.

1177
01:42:33,915 --> 01:42:35,448
Out.

1178
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:37,683
Back in the free world.

1179
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:41,254
Back with Katherine and Joshua.

1180
01:42:41,256 --> 01:42:43,222
Nothing out there is free.

1181
01:42:43,224 --> 01:42:46,359
Especially for a rat with
a target on his back.

1182
01:42:46,361 --> 01:42:48,895
You know, harlon, when
i walk outta here...

1183
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:52,198
The deal walks with me, man.

1184
01:42:54,301 --> 01:42:56,202
Have a nice trip.

1185
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:02,241
All right.

1186
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:05,211
Good luck in here.

1187
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:45,344
Come on, money.

1188
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:00,993
Easy.

1189
01:45:01,695 --> 01:45:02,828
Right there.

1190
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:34,727
Now that we're
looking eye to eye...

1191
01:45:34,729 --> 01:45:36,796
You're gonna answer something.

1192
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:40,566
Shotgun's body was discovered
around five o'clock

1193
01:45:40,568 --> 01:45:42,568
which means there's no way he
could've tipped off the cops

1194
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:44,870
with the location since
Herman didn't send you

1195
01:45:44,872 --> 01:45:47,807
the coordinates until an
hour before the meet.

1196
01:45:48,742 --> 01:45:50,810
So explain to me how three
different agencies had time to

1197
01:45:50,812 --> 01:45:53,079
set up and take everyone down.

1198
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:02,888
I gave you a gift...

1199
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:06,359
And you spit in my face.

1200
01:46:08,795 --> 01:46:11,397
How does it feel to
be the walking dead?

1201
01:46:12,799 --> 01:46:15,434
No different than
the last 10 years.

1202
01:46:15,436 --> 01:46:17,536
Oh, we'll see about that...

1203
01:46:18,705 --> 01:46:21,440
When your old lady and
kid are lying in blood

1204
01:46:21,442 --> 01:46:23,542
and you get to live with
knowing you're the cause.

1205
01:46:23,544 --> 01:46:25,911
Get this lame away from me!

1206
01:46:37,858 --> 01:46:39,558
Cuff up, money.

1207
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:44,063
Cuff up, money.

1208
01:47:15,195 --> 01:47:16,562
Okay, money.

1209
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:24,970
Okay!

1210
01:47:28,074 --> 01:47:29,675
All right, easy!

1211
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:32,578
Easy.

1212
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:34,480
Drop your radio.

1213
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:35,848
Easy.

1214
01:47:36,683 --> 01:47:38,451
Easy, money.

1215
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:41,086
Slowly.

1216
01:47:51,998 --> 01:47:53,732
What the fuck, money?

1217
01:47:57,604 --> 01:47:59,538
You knew they'd
put you back here.

1218
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:02,975
That's why you lead
the cops to the bust...

1219
01:48:03,877 --> 01:48:05,578
To get to me.

1220
01:48:08,715 --> 01:48:10,149
Well played.

1221
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:14,653
Let's get down, wood.

1222
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:06,205
Nobody's touching my family.

1223
01:49:57,123 --> 01:49:59,224
We're gonna get a few
things straight here.

1224
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,363
I'm already doing life...

1225
01:50:05,865 --> 01:50:08,133
So I could give a shit
about additional time.

1226
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:13,172
But I'm not sitting on
death row waiting to be put

1227
01:50:13,174 --> 01:50:15,074
down like some animal.

1228
01:50:16,376 --> 01:50:19,144
So you write it up that
he attacked me with the

1229
01:50:19,146 --> 01:50:23,248
blade first. In return, your
arrangement with us stands...

1230
01:50:24,718 --> 01:50:26,885
Including the monthly
deposits into your account.

1231
01:50:28,221 --> 01:50:31,857
Reason I can guarantee
these terms is...

1232
01:50:34,928 --> 01:50:36,762
I'm running the show now.

1233
01:50:44,938 --> 01:50:46,271
Say it.

1234
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:52,645
You're running the show.

1235
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:39,258
Pop the battery and
break the sim card.

1236
01:51:49,402 --> 01:51:51,203
You gotta be shitting me.

1237
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:54,139
I still don't get this guy.

1238
01:51:56,076 --> 01:51:57,910
But I fucking like him.

1239
01:52:23,870 --> 01:52:25,237
Got some mail, money.

1240
01:52:29,909 --> 01:52:31,043
Thanks.

1241
01:53:11,217 --> 01:53:14,386
Mom told me you've
gotten life without parole now.

1242
01:53:15,922 --> 01:53:18,090
I don't think I'll ever
understand why any of this has

1243
01:53:18,092 --> 01:53:22,394
happened but I wanted you to
know that I've accepted reality

1244
01:53:23,329 --> 01:53:26,031
which is why I will do what
you've asked me in your letter.

1245
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,568
I'm moving on with my life, dad.

1246
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:33,138
I will learn from
your mistakes...

1247
01:53:34,274 --> 01:53:36,975
And I will always
be mom's protector.

1248
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:40,045
But most importantly...

1249
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:42,414
I want you to know...

1250
01:53:43,049 --> 01:53:44,483
That I've forgiven you.

1251
01:53:45,852 --> 01:53:47,986
Your son, Josh.
