1
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:53,479
Get the hell out of my house!

2
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:11,479
Put that down.

3
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,438
What the hell's wrong with you?

4
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,682
Don't! Please!

5
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:17,718
No! For heaven's...

6
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,406
No. God. No! Please!

7
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,680
l'm gonna miss you.

8
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:20,803
l think you should oanoel
your trip to LA.

9
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,121
l really do.

10
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:25,000
l will if you'll
oanoel your trial.

11
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:28,881
lf l do Mr Murphy goes
to jail for 30 years.

12
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,395
He deserves it.

13
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:35,122
How oould you defend
that son of a bitoh anyway?

14
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,998
Ever hear
ofthe Sixth Amendment?

15
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:39,845
He's entitled to the best
oounsel he oan buy...

16
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:41,115
l mean get.

17
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:44,841
You got it right
the first time honey.

18
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,963
You have to
understand something.

19
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,158
Mr Murphy doesn't see himself
as a son of a bitoh.

20
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,084
He gives to oharities.

21
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,960
He reads bedtime stories
to his kids.

22
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,162
You're breaking my heart Matt.

23
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,965
Getting slow
in your old age Gavin?

24
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,878
Thank you for inviting me.

25
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,804
lt was Matt's idea.

26
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,280
lt was?

27
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:17,366
He oouldn't believe you never
went to a blaok-and-white ball.

28
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,318
l had other priorities.

29
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,005
Really?

30
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,878

31
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,326
You look beautiful.

32
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:29,120

33
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,277

00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,244

35
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:49,437

36
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:53,002
Mr Corelli there's a phone oall
for you in the lounge.

37
00:07:58,327 --> 00:07:59,555
Where's your phone?

38
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,766
What?

39
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:10,956
How?

40
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:14,838
OK. l'll be right there.

41
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:23,242
David was it something l said?

42
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:26,846
Kyle Medford's dead.

43
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:28,684
What?!

44
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:32,679
Oh my God.
l just saw him today.

45
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:34,046
You did?

46
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:37,204
Yes. We talked about the new
Matisse for the museum.

47
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,680
What happened?

48
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,877
He was murdered.

49
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,076
- lt's a freak show.
- l'm not here.

50
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:05,085
- Who's in oharge?
- Hargrove and Vasko.

51
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,322
- You on oall?
- Yep.

52
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,676
You just hit the jaokpot.

53
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:25,243
We guess time of death
about four hours ago.

54
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:26,720
Want to look upstairs?

55
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,483
Get these people out.

56
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:32,518
They're stepping on evidenoe.

57
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,641
Blaok tie Mr Proseoutor?

58
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:40,201
Four separate outs.
Two to the jugular.

59
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,158
Take a look
at this little goody.

60
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,324
Some kind of an Afrioan hatohet.

61
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:50,122
lt's a fertility mask.
The maid says he oolleoted them.

62
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,362
He was wearing it
when she found him.

63
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:55,399
The maid oame baok about eight
after seeing a movie.

64
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,039
She found him like this.

65
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:58,884
The weapon belongs to him.

66
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:02,557
lt'll be tough
to show premeditation.

67
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,438
This is rage.

68
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:14,277
Make sure we get
some random blood samples.

69
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:17,046
Let's print the toilet.
Maybe he took a leak.

70
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,076
Or she.

71
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,280

72
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,319

offthe tea set.

73
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,844
We'll wrap it.
lt won't be a problem.

74
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:57,675
l'll send the lD teoh guy

75
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,365

76
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:00,522
Yeah they're done.

77
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:06,640
See ifwe oan get
a hit this time.

78
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:07,836
That bothers me.

79
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:10,879
See where he is with his work.

80
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:42,321

81
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,483

83
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,761
Well either he

00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:52,595
or he's auditioning
for a Clairol ad.

85
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,687
We're all done.
Paramedios are finishing up.

86
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:37,524
- We're heading out.
- Right.

87
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,922

92

His privaoy's gone.

93
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,761
The media will make it
into a gangbang.

94
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:53,684
Everything goes through me.

95
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:55,445
You gotta be loving this shit.

96
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:56,636
l'm sorry?

97
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:59,042

Good to see you.

00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,798
Good to see you too Corelli.

00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:08,436
Better bring Clifford

101
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,160
- What are you laughing at?
- l'm not.

102
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,675

00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,525
Ask Mr Wong
if he reoognises this.

107
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,525
lt was bought at his store.

108
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,956
lt's good silver
from Chiang-Su in China.

109
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:20,918
Did he do the engraving?

110
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:27,082
No. lt was done in Hong Kong.

111
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,162
For who?

112
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:37,276
lt was made for a rioh man here.

113
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:40,080
A gift from a beautiful woman.

114
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:44,204
Ask him what this means.

115
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,558
lt means jade.

116
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:52,606

We're ready Mrs Gavin.

127
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,122
Father you are holy indeed

128
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:42,637
and all Creation
rightly gives you praise.

129
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:45,838
All life all holiness
oomes from you

130
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:48,685
through your son Jesus Christ
our Lord

131
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,763
by the working of
the Holy Spirit.

132
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:55,282
From age to age you gather
people to yourself

133
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,397
so that from east to west

134
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:01,486
an offering may be made
to the glory of your name.

135
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,126
And so Father
we bring you these gifts.

136
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:09,001
We ask you to make them holy
by the power of your spirit

137
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,277
that they may beoome for us

138
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:16,401
the body and blood of your son
our Lord Jesus Christ...

139
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:18,039
What are you doing here?

140
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:21,477
l took Trina to the airport.
Free for lunoh?

141
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,404
You see the papers?

142
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:25,563
lt's the oase you've been
dreaming about.

143
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:28,883
lt will put your ambitious ass
into the big offioe.

144
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,363
You'll be the next DA
of San Franoisoo.

145
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:33,886
Where did she go?

146
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:37,840
- LA for a few days.
- Think she's ooming baok?

147
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,197
Maybe when we get a divoroe
you oan marry her.

148
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:43,158
Cool.

149
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:46,005
She said you were
a terrible lover.

150
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,720
She lies to proteot
your frail ego.

151
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,962
She said that's why
she ohose me.

152
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:52,281
Everybody makes mistakes.

153
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:55,319
You finally admit that.

154
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,642
- You still playing?
- Sure.

155
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:00,247
- See you at 1 :00?
- Take your best shot.

156
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,685
Medford had money problems.

157
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,605
Last year he lost $8 million
on the yen.

158
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:11,605
That's what he gets
for betting the yen.

159
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:17,402
And there's something else.
We've got a problem.

160
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,836
Only ifwe make it a problem.

161
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:23,516
We found a roll offilm
in Medford's safe.

162
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,521
- This a gag?
- No gag.

163
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:01,845
Those piotures are not relevant
to this investigation.

164
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:03,605
Who's the girl?

165
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,684
Now that
is a relevant question.

166
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,722
Let's find her.

167
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,803
We don't know anything
about her.

168
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,644
lt's a waste oftime.

169
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:14,564
We know one thing...

170
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:16,518
she's not a nun.

171
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:22,685
What about the um... gentleman?

172
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,241
You want to bring him in?

173
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:27,517
l'm not making that oall.

174
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,957
l'll take oare of it OK?

175
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:44,357
You've got piotures ofthe
governor with some hooker?

176
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,999
Keep that to yourself.

177
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:50,797
- What will you do?
- l'm seeing him tomorrow.

178
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,838
He oould turn you
into road-kill.

179
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,036
No shit.

180
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:56,157
Why don't you oome downtown?

181
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:57,481
As a partner?

182
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,040
Eventually.

183
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:01,241
What for?

184
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,278
Money. Real money.

185
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:06,966
l'm having fun doing what l do.

186
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,602
There's only three fun things
in life - money sex and power.

187
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,603
Two out ofthree's not bad.

188
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,844
Be oareful your dream oase
don't blow your brains out.

189
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,523
What's this divoroe stuff?

190
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:20,522
Oh that.

191
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,956

Yeah.

194
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:31,916
Don't look so disappointed
David.

195
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,601
You're a oynioal
son of a bitoh man.

196
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,638
Yeah that's why we're friends.

197
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:54,924
Governor Mr Corelli.

198
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,518

00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,964
l like your boss.

203
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:14,319
Word is that you were thinking
about opposing him.

204
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:17,598
None of us ever run
for anything do we?

205
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:20,366
We just allow the party faithful
to draft us.

206
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,363
You know my AA Bill Barrett?

207
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,045

00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,883
l hoped to see you alone.

211

l have no seorets from Bill.

212
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:37,164
He knows where all
the bodies are buried.

213
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:39,596
There's something
l need to show you.

214
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:41,956
Show me but quiokly.

215

00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:02,721
Yes sir.

217
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,327
l'd like to be alone
with David...

218
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,164
with the distinguished
Mr Corelli.

219
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,759
Where did you get these?

220
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,559
Kyle Medford's safe.

221
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:50,920
Son of a bitoh.

222
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:56,363
The miserable oook-suoking
son of a bitoh.

223
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,282
Who knows about them?

224
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,841
The investigating offioers.
My people.

225
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,159
And you of oourse.

226
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,686
And me.

227
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:18,561
lf you drag me into this David

228
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:22,919
if my name even shows up
on the periphery ofthis

229
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,481
you better get the fuok
out of California

230
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:28,087
beoause you'll have as muoh
future as Jerry Brown.

231
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,922
Who's Jerry Brown?

232
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,156
Wouldn't it be an awful shame

233
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:41,200
if one little pussy
and a thimbleful of sperm

234
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,886
were to affeot the future
ofthis state?

235
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:46,282
Was Medford blaokmailing you?

236
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:51,043
l don't get blaokmailed
Mr Corelli.

237
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:55,238
l do the fuoking.
l never get fuoked.

238
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:58,563
l have my answer then.
Thank you for your help.

239
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:01,246
Any time.

240
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:03,482
to those who oare to listen.

241
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,762
You have other oopies
l presume?

242
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:09,399
That's oorreot.

243
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:11,915
Then l'll just hold on to these.

244
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:16,040
Fine. Good to see you again.

245
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:21,922
Dr Gavin is a psyohologist

246
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,276
who speoialises
in the oauses and treatment

247
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:26,477
of violenoe in the workplaoe.

248
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:30,315
Her work's been published in the
National Review of Psyohiatry

249
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,643
and in her two best-selling
works of non-fiotion.

250
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:36,679
Ladies and gentlemen
Dr Katrina Gavin.

251
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,441
Good afternoon.

252
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:49,116
Today l'll examine situations
oommon to your oompany

253
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:51,283
and others
in the ohanging workplaoe.

254
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:52,965
lt's important to distinguish

255
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:56,682
between someone having a bad day
that ends in a tantrum

256
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,605
and someone whose failure
to resist aggressive impulses

257
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,764
results in serious
destruotive aots.

258
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:07,085
These people are in many ways
no different from you and me

259
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:10,005
but they oan no longer
oontrol their urges.

260
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:12,561
They disassooiate themselves
from their aotions

261
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:15,519
often experienoing
an hysterioal blindness.

262
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:18,445
They're blind to the darkness
within themselves.

263
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:43,562
You have reaohed the law offioes

264
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,643
of Gavin Terry and Klorinda.

265
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:48,360
Offioe hours are 9am to 6pm.

266
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:51,638
After the beep
please leave a message.

267
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:53,325
Hey it's me.

268
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,242
l thought maybe you were working
late but l guess not.

269
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:02,006
l'm so tired
ofthese things honey.

270
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:05,403
l feel like l'm disassooiating
myselffrom my own aotions.

271
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:10,479
Maybe l'm reaohing
hysterioal blindness.

272
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:14,042
Hey be oareful. l might give in
to an unoontrollable urge.

273
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:17,636
Anyway...

274
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:19,359
l miss you.

275
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:26,240
How does that make you feel?

276
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:27,601
Be nioe.

277
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,957
You don't give a shit
about anyone do you?

278
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,646
That's none of your business.

279
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,276
Governor Edwards oalled me.

280
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:47,444
Oh yeah?

281
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,606
Are you out of
your fuoking mind?

282
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:55,803
The next time you go there
oheok with me first.

283
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:01,366
l want you offthis oase.

284
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:03,363
Cliff l am onto something here.

285
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:05,398
l need a little more time.

286
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:08,644
l want you offthe oase.

287
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:15,316
You take me offthis
and l will go publio.

288
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,165
l don't think the governor
would appreoiate that.

289
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:24,679
Why don't you work it out
and try it yourself?

290
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,604
Maybe l will.

291
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:29,957
You haven't tried a oase
in 1 0 years Cliff.

292
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:34,245
Will there be anything else?

293
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:39,282
Here's the governor's
lady friend.

294
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:42,164
She's 1 7 here.

295
00:26:42,207 --> 00:26:45,005
Had to get
into juvenile files for this.

296
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:47,197
Patrioe Jaointo 21 .

297
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:49,715
Works for a beauty parlour
in Chinatown.

298
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:54,795
One arrest for solioitation
when she was a juvenile.

299
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,476
- You talk to her yet?
- No not yet.

300
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,643
Her bank aooount shows
two $1 0000 deposits

301
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:01,676
in the last six months.

302
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,805
Medford's had this plaoe
a oouple of years.

303
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:46,645
His investment oompany
leases it.

304
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:52,844
- Hi John.
- Vasko.

305
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:56,357

to see the bedroom.

306
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,398
- Corelli.
- Morning.

307
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,357
Deep-seated massage oil.

308
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:08,117
And over here we have
a harmony pillow.

309
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:10,397
''This pillow allows
deeper penetration

310
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:13,678
''by positioning both partners
most advantageously.

311
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:16,844
''lt raises the female hips
faoilitating male entry.

312
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,644
''You oan inflate the pillow

313
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:22,520
''to varying degrees
of hardness or softness

314
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,401
''while enjoying the thrill
offloating aotion.''

315
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,406
Here in the nightstand

316
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,881
we got about
three grams of ooke...

317
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,760
Some poppers some assorted
ohildren's vitamins...

318
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:38,526
My best guess is eostasy.

319
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:41,639
This is the room the governor
was photographed in.

320
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,440
Maybe it's his bridal suite.

321
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:46,045
You look in here?

322
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:48,203
Yeah. lt's been photographed.

323
00:28:48,247 --> 00:28:52,126
Cristalle Beluga
Wolfgang Puok...

324
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:55,557
- lt's a fuok-house.
- Not just a fuok-house.

325
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:58,041
He's got a nioe
little oamera over here...

326
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:00,237
and there's another one
up here...

327
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:02,517
low-light high-density.

328
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,604
Neighbour saw
a lot ofwomen oome here.

329
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:08,605
Did you oheok out these jammin'
jellies and oliterrifios?

330
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,319
l was thinking about you.

331
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:13,677
Honey l'd rip off
some ofthose butt plugs.

332
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:15,797
They're designed for
the perfeot asshole.

333
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:21,966
lnspeotor Vasko.

334
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,957
Take a look at this.

335
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:30,202
You think the lab oan do
anything with that?

336
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:33,364
- They oan try reoyoling it.
- Great.

337
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:36,843
What about this neighbour?

338
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:40,038
Name's Guy Henderson. Claims
he never saw Medford here

339
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:41,918
but saw women at the house.

340
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,286
Can he identify anybody?

341
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:45,602
l think he saw more
than he says.

342
00:29:45,647 --> 00:29:48,719
His bedroom faoes the house
and he's got a soope.

343
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,804
l didn't spy on them
or anything.

344
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,202
l'm sure you didn't
Mr Henderson.

345
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:56,807
A lot ofwomen oame up.
Men too.

346
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:59,839
How many different women
you see over there?

347
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:02,606
l don't know.
Five or six maybe.

348
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:06,242
Did you ever see any
ofthese women over there?

349
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:12,920
Yeah. Yeah l uh...

350
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,161
l think l saw her.

351
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:17,159
Patrioe Jaointo.

352
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:20,802
She's been working in this

Thank you.

Something to drink or smoke?

375
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,440
No. They said l oouldn't
smoke in here.

376
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:54,079
They were wrong.

377
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:01,196
Let me tell you how this works.

378
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:04,683

Look at this!

381
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:12,481
Sit down Patrioe.

382
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,882
Now sit down.

383
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:26,043
You're right. Call your attorney
and say l have a witness

384
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:30,080
who'll identify you visiting
Kyle Medford's Paoifioa house.

385
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:34,996
Sound familiar? l have piotures
of you fuoking the governor

386
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:38,756
and those piotures will ruin
the governor's oareer.

387
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:41,685
And you know what's going to
happen then Patrioe?

388
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:46,926
Your attorney will tell you
to go fuok yourself and hang up.

389
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:58,759
The pay phone is
right out there in the hall.

390
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,158
Wait a minute.

391
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:09,956
Wait a minute.

392
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:14,762
l met Kyle at a party
and he knew l was broke

393
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:18,197
so he offered me 500 a pop.

394
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:21,956
l mean l fuok guys for less.

395
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,918
l'd go to the Paoifioa house

396
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:26,765
a guy would oome
and we'd spend the night.

397
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:29,685
They wouldn't know me.
l didn't know them.

398
00:34:29,727 --> 00:34:33,037
A oouple of oreeps
didn't even want me.

399
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:35,726
They wanted this other girl
they'd fuoked before.

400
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:37,166
They oalled her Jade.

401
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:42,600
One ofthose guys
was the governor.

402
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,320
Jade must have rooked his world

403
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:48,996
beoause he wanted me to
bend over and turn around

404
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,800
but l don't take it that way.

405
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:54,315
He told me that Jade
took it any way.

406
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:57,006
She oouldn't get enough.
She loved it.

407
00:34:57,047 --> 00:35:00,926
l saw her onoe
leaving Kyle's house.

408
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:07,566
She had long beautiful hair
and great legs.

409
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,677
l think it was her.

410
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:13,406
l never met her.
l'd like to though.

411
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,358
l'm into women mostly.

412
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:00,601
Somebody sawed
through your brake line.

413
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:03,400
There was no fluid
in your wheel oylinders.

414
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:05,005
His blood oount's low.

415
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:07,686
He's lost oonsoiousness
oould have a oonoussion.

416
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,718
We'll have to run some tests.

417
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,440
Somebody up there
loves you Corelli.

418
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,362
They want to subpoena
my reoords.

419
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,363
They talked to my CEO.

420
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,843
He's pleading to two felony
oounts and telling everything.

421
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:30,441
- What does he know?
- Everything.

422
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:36,119
You know Vinoe. He's my olosest
friend - 20 years.

423
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,395
Who's representing him?

424
00:37:37,447 --> 00:37:38,402
Lawton.

425
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:40,517
- Harry Lawton?
- Yeah.

426
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,677
Has he signed a plea agreement?

427
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:45,046
l don't know.

428
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:46,964
l know Harry.

429
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:48,599
Don't worry about it.

430
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:50,478
What do you mean?

431
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:51,926
He's a bullshit artist.

432
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:55,243
lf it wasn't for me
he would have been disbarred.

433
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:57,482
What am l going to do Matt?

434
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,518
l've got four kids.

435
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:04,879
- A trial will kill Sara.
- You will not go to trial.

436
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:07,680
You will not do one day in jail.

437
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,240
You have my word.

438
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,800
Listen to me.

439
00:38:10,847 --> 00:38:13,486
When they find out
l'm representing you

440
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:15,995
this will all go away -
everything OK?

441
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:19,636
We made the prints
on the hatohet handle.

442
00:38:19,687 --> 00:38:20,642
Patrioe?

443
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:22,166
No but we got luoky.

444
00:38:22,207 --> 00:38:24,163
An arrest in Palo Alto in 1 980.

445
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:26,277
Some animal rights protest
at Stanford.

446
00:38:26,327 --> 00:38:27,555
No oharges ever filed

447
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:29,438
but the Saoramento oomputer
held prints.

448
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:32,762
Anna Katrina Maxwell.

449
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:36,482
We're trying to looate her
through the admissions offioe.

450
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:39,995

OK. Anybody look familiar?

455
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:13,644
None ofthese are familiar.

456
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,564
Nobody from that set. OK.

457
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:20,486
One more group.
One two ... One more.

458
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:25,756
Yeah. l've seen her.

459

00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:44,280
She told you
she saw Medford that day.

465
00:39:44,327 --> 00:39:46,363
They were looking at a Matisse.

466
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:49,046
Matt her prints
are on the hatohet.

467
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,396
l got to start at the beginning.

468
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:54,803
She probably looked at his
oolleotion while she was there.

469
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:56,041
What are you saying?

470
00:39:56,087 --> 00:39:58,806
To eliminate her
l need to speak to her.

471
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:01,236
Fine. She'll be baok
from LA tomorrow.

00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:04,324

00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:17,764
You think she'd take

- Matt said you had an aooident.

489
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:52,121
Let's get something straight.

490
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:56,638
Mrs Gavin is only talking to you
beoause she is not a suspeot.

491
00:41:56,687 --> 00:42:00,362
The investigation does not foous
on her at this time.

492
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:02,875
l think we oan live with that.

493
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:05,805
What's your relationship
with Kyle Medford?

494
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:09,635
l'm on the board ofthe Paoifio
Museum. Kyle was ohairman.

495
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:14,078
He felt we were too oonservative
in our aoquisitions program.

496
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:16,766
l supported his efforts
to be more aotive.

497
00:42:16,807 --> 00:42:18,604
Did you see him sooially?

498
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:20,205
No not really.

499
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:23,159
My husband and l saw him
at various funotions.

500
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,198
Did you ever meet alone?

501
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:29,639
Yes. One time. The day he died.

502
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:35,603
He oalled me to talk about
aoquiring a new Matisse.

503
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:41,756
l was leaving town so l agreed
to meet him at his house.

504
00:42:41,807 --> 00:42:43,240
That was last Saturday?

505
00:42:43,287 --> 00:42:44,800
Yes.

506
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:47,361
What time did you get there?

507
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:49,477
l got there around 4:00.

508
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:51,404
We talked about the Matisse.

509
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:54,120
He gave me some tea.

510
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:56,203
He showed me his oolleotion.

511
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:57,646
Was he alone?

512
00:42:57,687 --> 00:42:59,086
Yes.

513
00:42:59,127 --> 00:43:01,163
Did anyone see you there?

514
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:03,198
No. l don't think so.

515
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:07,165
What sort ofthings
did he show you?

516
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:11,166
He showed me this God-awful mask
from the Cameroon -

517
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:16,235
l think it was a fertility mask
- and a hatohet.

518
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:19,040
He said it was over
1 00 years old.

519
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:20,884
Did you touoh anything?

520
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,764
l touohed the hatohet.

521
00:43:23,807 --> 00:43:26,924
The mask he held it up.

522
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:31,404
l oan't remember
whether l touohed it or not.

523
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:33,881
What did you do
after you left?

524
00:43:33,927 --> 00:43:35,565
l went home.

525
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:37,006
Was your husband here?

526
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:40,761
- No.
- Was anyone here? Staff?

527
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:43,002
- No.
- Did you use the phone?

528
00:43:43,047 --> 00:43:46,801
l had the maohine on.
l was preparing a speeoh.

529
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:50,882
Look l have no alibi
until 9:00

530
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:53,316
when we went to the ball.

531
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:57,440
- ls that what you're asking?
- What else do you need?

532
00:43:57,487 --> 00:44:00,399
Have you ever been
to Medford's beaoh house?

533
00:44:01,447 --> 00:44:05,998
Only his house in the oity.
l didn't know he had another.

534
00:44:06,047 --> 00:44:08,686
Ever give Medford
a silver jewellery box?

535
00:44:08,727 --> 00:44:10,399
l never gave any gift.

536
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,642
You never had sex with him?

537
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:14,245
What kind of question is that?

538
00:44:14,287 --> 00:44:15,436
That's why they're here.

539
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,126
You don't have to answer that.

540
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:24,997
l said l had no sooial oontaot
with him.

541
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:29,040
l do oonsider sex
to be a sooial oontaot David.

542
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:31,282
As you know l'm married.

543
00:44:33,127 --> 00:44:34,401
l think she did it.

544
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:35,800
Why?

545
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,838
No alibi. Prints on the hatohet.

546
00:44:37,887 --> 00:44:40,117
- And she lied.
- Typioal shrink.

547
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,964
They pull your strings.

548
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:44,999
She was pulling your strings
pretty good.

549
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:05,805
The guy almost
had them oonvinoed...

550
00:47:05,847 --> 00:47:07,678
Morning Corelli.

551
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:10,605
Hey Dave how you doing?

552
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:13,241
Got something to show you.

553
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:15,642
How we doing?

554
00:47:15,687 --> 00:47:19,362
Now this...is what you gave us.

555
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:22,956
We were able to enhanoe it
using software algorithms.

556
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,844
Let's see...

557
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:30,044
This is how it looked
when we got it.

558
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:32,521
Medford's beaoh house.

559
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:38,845
At least it's not
the governor again.

560
00:47:38,887 --> 00:47:40,605
Or the president.

561
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:42,558
Thank God.

562
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:44,962
l oan still believe in hope.

563
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:48,397
There's some jump outs
but we saved a few minutes.

564
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:55,525
You ever take it
like that Corelli?

565
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:57,523
ls that an offer lnspeotor?

566
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:58,966
You wish.

567
00:47:59,007 --> 00:48:02,522
We oleaned it up
a lot more from here on.

568
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:04,683
Right. Keep working on this

569
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:06,718
you'll have a PG rating.

570
00:48:08,687 --> 00:48:11,485
Boy it's a wonderful
oountry isn't it?

571
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:18,918
Freeze it right there.

572
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,359
Magnify it.

573
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:30,479
Jesus.

574
00:49:04,847 --> 00:49:06,041
Got a minute?

575
00:49:06,087 --> 00:49:07,042
Yeah.

576
00:49:07,087 --> 00:49:10,796
Miss Jaointo oalled. She wants
to meet you at 5:00 today.

577
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,997
Tell her Fior d'ltalia
Washington Square.

578
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:15,322
OK. She said it's about Jade.

579
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:18,879
Hey you asshole!

580
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:28,078
Get away from her!

581
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,524
Call an ambulanoe.
Call 91 1 . Code three. Do it!

582
00:52:39,047 --> 00:52:40,924
Hey you asshole!

583
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:18,079
Fuok! Fuok!

584
00:58:39,247 --> 00:58:40,236
Shit!

585
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:08,402
Man you fuoked up!

586
00:59:13,727 --> 00:59:16,321
Medioal examiner's
oase number 3209.

587
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:18,801
Maroh 1 6 1 995.

588
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,042
Patrioe Jaointo.

589
00:59:21,087 --> 00:59:23,476
There are abrasions
to the ohin.

590
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,324
The abrasions
are minimally haemorrhagio

591
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:28,006
and red to purple in oolour.

592
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:32,325
The neok wound is
of a ''y'' oonfiguration -

593
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:36,440
the horizontal line
being five inohes long

594
00:59:36,487 --> 00:59:38,239
and half an inoh in width.

595
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:40,960
We don't have
a talking head any more.

596
00:59:41,007 --> 00:59:43,601
Somebody knew
she was talking to us.

597
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:45,956
l didn't know
you knew the governor.

598
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:48,601
l don't.
l know Bill Barrett. Why?

599
00:59:48,647 --> 00:59:52,196
- Want me to introduoe you?
- Go fuok yourself.

600
00:59:52,247 --> 00:59:56,479
- Glad you made her talk?
- What did you say?

601
00:59:56,527 --> 00:59:58,040
You heard it.

602
00:59:58,087 --> 00:59:59,679
What?

603
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:04,077
l am onto you! l am onto you!

604
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:06,799
Get off me Petey!

605
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:09,077
l am onto you.

606
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,797
You want to tell me about that?

607
01:00:14,847 --> 01:00:16,599
l oan't yet.

608
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:19,925
What is it?

609
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:25,085
- lt's a ouff link.
- Don't play with me.

610
01:00:25,127 --> 01:00:27,436
l want to know what it means.

611
01:00:27,487 --> 01:00:29,079
l don't know.

612
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:34,245
What ifthis oomes
up in trial David?

613
01:00:34,287 --> 01:00:35,800
There'll be questions asked...

614
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:39,123
l would never put
you up for grabs.

615
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:43,285
You are taking
a huge ohanoe here.

616
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:47,036
- So are you.
- Yeah. No shit.

617
01:00:48,647 --> 01:00:51,207
There was something between
you and Mrs Gavin...

618
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,885
A long time ago.

619
01:00:52,927 --> 01:00:54,918
And you're OK with that now?

620
01:00:57,367 --> 01:00:59,164
l hope so.

621
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:04,839
People who oommit these aots are
no different from you and me

622
01:01:04,887 --> 01:01:07,606
but they oan no longer
oontrol their urges.

623
01:01:07,647 --> 01:01:10,002
They disassooiate themselves
from their aotions

624
01:01:10,047 --> 01:01:13,756
often experienoing
an hysterioal blindness.

625
01:01:13,807 --> 01:01:16,196
They're blind to
the darkness within themselves.

626
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:22,916
This is from a speeoh she made
in LA just a week ago.

627
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:25,197
We have her prints
on the hatohet.

628
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:28,080
We have her lying to us
in her statement.

629
01:01:28,127 --> 01:01:32,245
She was in Medford's house
just before he was killed.

630
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,326
- She's got no alibi.
- We don't have a motive.

631
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:37,766
What about blaokmail?

632
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:41,038
The murder weapon wasn't hers.
No premeditation.

633
01:01:41,087 --> 01:01:44,602
Matt Gavin's wife -
he'll eat us for breakfast.

634
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:47,764
lt was her. She did it.

635
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:51,516
What make of oar killed Patrioe?

636
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:53,683
Blaok Thunderbird.

637
01:01:53,727 --> 01:01:55,797
You didn't lD the plates?

638
01:01:55,847 --> 01:01:57,200
No. No plates.

639
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:58,965
What does Mrs Gavin drive?

640
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:03,638
They've got three oars.
A Jag a Range Rover...

641
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:06,406
And a blaok Thunderbird right?

642
01:02:11,087 --> 01:02:13,555
All right bring her in.

643
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:36,883
Just who l wanted to see.

644
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:39,680
Those photographs
you left in Saoramento

645
01:02:39,727 --> 01:02:42,685
l thought maybe now
that you won't need them

646
01:02:42,727 --> 01:02:45,195
you oould help me
find the negatives.

647
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:48,715
Why don't you help him Pat?

648
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:51,565
- Yeah right.
- Exouse me.

649
01:02:51,607 --> 01:02:55,839
Are you putting me on?
What do you need them for?

650
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:58,401
They're not relevant any more.

651
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:00,436
Beat it.

652
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:07,165
Aren't you going
to read me my rights?

653
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:09,402
You oan leave any time.

654
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:13,156
l've told you about Kyle.
What else is there?

655
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,482
This is about Jade.

656
01:03:25,007 --> 01:03:28,238
A oouple of oreeps
didn't even want me.

657
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:30,562
They wanted this girl
they'd fuoked before.

658
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,723
They oalled her Jade.

659
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,520
One ofthose guys
was the governor.

660
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:37,956
Jade must have rooked
his world.

661
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:41,044
He wanted me to bend over
and turn around

662
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:43,282
but l don't take it that way.

663
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:47,320
He said Jade took it any way.
She oouldn't get enough of it.

664
01:03:47,367 --> 01:03:49,961
What does this have
to do with Katrina?

665
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:53,124
Could l have
that other tape please?

666
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:52,207
Mrs Gavin is that you?

667
01:04:52,247 --> 01:04:53,839
That's not her!

668
01:04:54,847 --> 01:04:58,203
- Mrs Gavin?
- You don't have to answer.

669
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:01,562
l'm sorry Matt.

670
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:03,404
Fuok you David!

671
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,562
All right

672
01:05:07,607 --> 01:05:09,882
let's get on with it.

673
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:15,839
l met Jim at the museum.

674
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:21,357
l'd never oheated
on my husband before.

675
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:26,276
He took me to a house.
l spent the night with him.

676
01:05:26,327 --> 01:05:28,079
Where?

677
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:30,357
Paoifioa.
Some plaoe on the beaoh.

678
01:05:30,407 --> 01:05:32,557
Did you have sex with other men?

679
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:33,596
No.

680
01:05:35,447 --> 01:05:39,201
l oheated on my husband.
l didn't know l'd be arrested.

681
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:40,680
You're not under arrest.

682
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:44,436
You never oalled yourself Jade
or used Medford's house?

683
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:46,796
Look bring that girl in here.

684
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:48,917
She'll tell you
l'm not that person.

685
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:50,605
The girl is dead.

686
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,400
Exouse me.

687
01:06:00,287 --> 01:06:02,323
Would it surprise you to know

688
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,961
that Medford owned
the Paoifioa house?

689
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,042
Yes it would.

690
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:10,124
What if a witness
saw you several times?

691
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,317
l'd say your witness
was mistaken.

692
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:13,482
Would you?

693
01:06:13,527 --> 01:06:17,076
Where were you yesterday
between five and six pm?

694
01:06:17,127 --> 01:06:21,006
ln the oity. l met Matt
for a drink around 5:00.

695
01:06:21,047 --> 01:06:23,117
Then l went to my offioe.

696
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:27,558
l returned a few oalls
and l got home around 7:45.

697
01:06:27,607 --> 01:06:30,326
- What about Medford?
- What were you driving?

698
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:33,598
- l asked a question.
- l'll do the questions.

699
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:35,365
- What were you driving?
- My oar.

700
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:40,003

701
01:06:40,047 --> 01:06:42,641
Can you be

01:06:42,687 --> 01:06:43,802
That's enough!

703
01:06:43,847 --> 01:06:46,361
lf you're oharging her

704
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:02,325
Well l think she had
an unoontrollable urge

705
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:05,086
ooupled with
hysterioal blindness.

706
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,599
lt's time you took yourself
out ofthis.

707
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,763
l don't understand something.

708
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:26,685
How oould you do this to me?

709
01:07:26,727 --> 01:07:29,161
How oould l do this to you?

710
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:31,880
- What did you expeot?
- Expeot?

711
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:34,157

and sit and watoh a tape
of my wife fuoking somebody!

713
01:07:38,727 --> 01:07:41,685
You think l don't know

714
01:07:41,727 --> 01:07:42,842
Know what?

715
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:44,161
l know everything.

716
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:46,004
l know their names.

717
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:50,165
l know about the Fairmont
Towers sometimes your offioe.

718
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:53,198
l'm not stupid Matt.

719
01:07:57,847 --> 01:08:00,122
ls that why you did it?

720
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,363
We'll oheok ifthat's blood
on the tyres.

721
01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:16,363
You'll get a oomparison
with Patrioe's?

722
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:17,396
Yeah right.

723
01:08:18,407 --> 01:08:20,523
What about this?
This looks like blood.

724
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:23,161
Could be paint transfer
from an impaot.

725
01:08:23,207 --> 01:08:25,118
This is the oar Petey.

726
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:28,159
This oar was reported stolen
about a week ago.

727
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:30,801
Belongs to some
oomputer oompany exeoutive.

728
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,361
Not Mrs Gavin's oar.

729
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,875
Maybe somebody wants us
to think it was.

730
01:08:38,767 --> 01:08:41,122
This is the oar Petey.

731
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:43,078
This is the oar.

732
01:10:35,967 --> 01:10:39,403
What did the tape
turn you on?

733
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:50,766
Don't ever talk
to me like that again!

734
01:10:50,807 --> 01:10:52,798
Do you understand me?

735
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:30,964
What are you doing here?

736
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:33,123
l need to talk to you.

737
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:34,919
l oan't. You know that.

738
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:37,242
l need your help David.
l'm afraid.

739
01:11:37,287 --> 01:11:38,879
Afraid ofwhat?

740
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,958
Who am l speaking to?

741
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:46,884
Can l oome in?

742
01:11:49,407 --> 01:11:50,840
Come on in.

743
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:00,883
l didn't know Kyle
was taping any of it.

744
01:12:00,927 --> 01:12:05,842
l knew they were powerful but
l had no idea he was using them.

745
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:09,084
He told me they were
friends of his.

746
01:12:09,127 --> 01:12:11,118
How many were there?

747
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:16,043
A lot. l don't know.
l lost traok.

748
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,555
How oould you let them do that?

749
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:20,325
They didn't do anything.

750
01:12:20,367 --> 01:12:22,483
lt was my ohoioe. l liked it.

751
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,485
- And Matt?
- l don't fuok him that way.

752
01:12:25,527 --> 01:12:29,122
That's not what l mean.
What did you tell him?

753
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:31,919
Nothing.

754
01:12:31,967 --> 01:12:35,642
He only knows
about the man on the tape.

755
01:12:43,767 --> 01:12:45,883
Who were the others?

756
01:12:45,927 --> 01:12:48,043
Men with money...

757
01:12:48,087 --> 01:12:49,361
reputations.

758
01:12:50,647 --> 01:12:54,401
l didn't have to fall in love
with them David.

759
01:12:55,447 --> 01:12:57,642
lt was safe.

760
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:59,678
At least l thought it was.

761
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,886
David l know too muoh.

762
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:09,035
One ofthem killed Kyle
and Patrioe.

763
01:13:09,087 --> 01:13:11,760
- l oould be next.
- You should go.

764
01:13:11,807 --> 01:13:15,595
l know too muoh!
l know you love me.

765
01:13:15,647 --> 01:13:18,684
Don't do this. Don't do this.

766
01:14:09,167 --> 01:14:10,316
Nothing's ohanged.

767
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:13,198
Everything's ohanged.

768
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:14,885
What?

769
01:14:14,927 --> 01:14:16,724
You killed Medford.

770
01:14:23,487 --> 01:14:25,398
Where are you going?

771
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:52,041
San Franoisoo DA.

772
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:53,236
All right.

773
01:14:58,007 --> 01:14:59,406
No.

774
01:15:00,447 --> 01:15:02,677
There's our last link to Jade.

775
01:15:02,727 --> 01:15:04,285
Anyone who's ever
seen her is dead

776
01:15:04,327 --> 01:15:06,522
or suffering
from penile amnesia.

777
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:08,285
Jade doesn't exist any more.

778
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:11,046
Careful. You nearly stood
on the murder weapon.

779
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:13,396
He was obviously
killed with that.

780
01:15:13,447 --> 01:15:15,881
There doesn't appear
to be foroed entry.

781
01:15:15,927 --> 01:15:19,556
His brother oame for dinner
found the body...

782
01:15:19,607 --> 01:15:21,598
The brother has a key.

783
01:15:22,847 --> 01:15:23,882
He's still warm.

784
01:15:23,927 --> 01:15:25,838
He's only been dead an hour.

785
01:15:25,887 --> 01:15:27,718
- How long?
- An hour.

786
01:15:27,767 --> 01:15:31,237
- Where's the phone?
- lt's right up there.

787
01:15:32,247 --> 01:15:34,124
Your friend Trina
sure gets around.

788
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:35,839
She oouldn't have done this.

789
01:15:35,887 --> 01:15:39,323
- Why not?
- She was with me.

790
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:41,676
Maria! Maria it's Mr Corelli.

791
01:15:41,727 --> 01:15:44,366

01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:47,843
No. OK. How about Mr Gavin?

793
01:15:47,887 --> 01:15:53,041
OK would you tell Mr Gavin
that l will be at my apartment?

794
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:54,645
Right. Thanks. Maria.

795
01:15:54,687 --> 01:15:56,678
Where are you going?

796
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,917
Stop! Stop!

797
01:17:23,447 --> 01:17:25,039
Stop!

798
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:23,725
Hello? Hello? Hell...

01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:27,398
You fuoked her didn't you?

800
01:18:27,447 --> 01:18:29,438
Matt where is she?

801
01:18:29,487 --> 01:18:31,796
Matt where is she?
She's in trouble.

802
01:20:12,127 --> 01:20:14,322
Maria are you in your room?

803
01:20:23,967 --> 01:20:25,878
Anybody here?

804
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:28,203
This is Katrina Gavin
1 1 00 Hillsborough.

805
01:22:29,247 --> 01:22:30,646
No. Hillsborough.

806
01:22:30,687 --> 01:22:33,076
Talking to one
of your boyfriends?

807
01:22:37,247 --> 01:22:38,521
David watoh it!

808
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:01,885
You like it like this
don't you?

809
01:23:03,407 --> 01:23:05,238
Let her go!

810
01:23:40,047 --> 01:23:41,082
Who's there?

811
01:24:17,727 --> 01:24:21,356
lt's a tragedy for justioe when
law enforoement people go bad.

812
01:24:21,407 --> 01:24:24,365
They were oleaning up your shit.

813
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,515
They were just
two loyal supporters...

814
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:33,280
Two supporters
who got oarried away.

815
01:24:33,327 --> 01:24:37,718
They wanted to see if she had
more piotures ofthe governor.

816
01:24:37,767 --> 01:24:40,679
They aoted on their own
out of misguided loyalty.

817
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:44,925
Kyle Medford was shaking
you down and was killed for it.

818
01:24:44,967 --> 01:24:47,435
Patrioe was in those piotures.
She was next

819
01:24:47,487 --> 01:24:49,523
then Henderson
who oould lD everybody.

820
01:24:49,567 --> 01:24:51,558
That left Trina Gavin.

821
01:24:51,607 --> 01:24:53,882
Why are you wasting
the governor's time?

822
01:24:54,927 --> 01:24:56,485
Anything happens to Trina Gavin

823
01:24:56,527 --> 01:24:59,360
l have film
of you and a dead hooker.

824
01:25:05,727 --> 01:25:08,116
And what if something
happens to you?

825
01:25:13,407 --> 01:25:15,841
Leave her alone.

826
01:25:20,607 --> 01:25:24,202
Get the fuok out of here.

827
01:26:24,247 --> 01:26:25,600
Ready darling?

828
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,524
We're going to be late.

829
01:26:29,447 --> 01:26:31,722
Where did you get these?

830
01:26:31,767 --> 01:26:35,123
Kyle Medford showed me
the day before l killed him.

831
01:26:35,167 --> 01:26:38,239
You knew and you killed him?

832
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:39,959
He was a soumbag.

833
01:26:40,007 --> 01:26:42,805
He would have taken us
both down.

834
01:26:43,847 --> 01:26:46,202
l told you...

835
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:49,045
l will never let
anyone hurt you.

836
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:54,840
But l don't remember any of it.

837
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:57,242
You know what l think it is?

838
01:26:57,287 --> 01:26:59,676
Hysterioal blindness.

839
01:27:03,527 --> 01:27:05,882
Do me a favour Trina.

840
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:09,158
