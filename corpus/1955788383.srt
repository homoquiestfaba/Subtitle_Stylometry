1
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,228
You like it?
All right.

2
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,719
I need to go.
My dad's here.

3
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,199
I'll see you tonight.
Yeah.

4
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,231
This is the dress.
Do you like it?

5
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,634
We've got to hurry.
Everyone's going.

6
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,711
There's only two left
in my size.

7
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,390
Come on, Dad, let's go.

8
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,399
When do I meet him?

9
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,754
His name's Chappy.

10
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,836
On the football team and very...
Chubby?

11
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,069
"Chappy."

12
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,476
You'll meet when he picks me up
for the dance.

13
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,154
Not before?

14
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,071
Dad, you really need
to go faster.

15
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,192
Will he drive you to the dance?

16
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,631
He's rented a limo.

17
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,478
So, he won't drive you?

18
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,915
Limos come with drivers.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,992
So, stop worrying.

20
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,756
It's a nice dress.
You'll be very pretty.

21
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,913
I want you to like it.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,035
I'm getting out.

23
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,155
No, no, no.
Wait until I park.

24
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,719
Everyone's already inside.

25
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,477
Fan, careful crossing
the street!

26
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,309
You stupid...

27
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,953
Metro desk, LAN Wood.

28
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,871
Listen carefully.

29
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,997
An action wing of the Authentic IRA
has just exploded a bomb

30
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,593
at the GET Bank
in Knightsbridge.

31
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,399
The code word is "Phoenix”.

32
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,195
Britain's banks are now targets
for the Authentic IRA.

33
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,159
The bombings will continue
as long as

34
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,037
Britain's financial
criminal institutions

35
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,398
persist in their support
of the illegal occupation of Northern Ireland.

36
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,033
A bomb just went off,

37
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,394
an OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

38
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,357
A group called the "Authentic IRA"
just phoned it in.

39
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,395
They're claiming credit.

40
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,754
Who's the Authentic IRA?

41
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,068
No idea.
Never heard of them.

42
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,113
Christ. There goes the Peace Accord
right back in the shit.

43
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,552
Listen up. A bank has just been bombed
in Knightsbridge.

44
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,389
A group calling itself the "Authentic IRA"
just phoned it in.

45
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,471
I want to know who they are,
who's behind them.

46
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,670
Call the Met, Sinn Féin,
monitor the blogs.

47
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,435
Is it the IRA, or is it something else?
ISIS? Al-Qaeda?

48
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,114
What are you waiting for?
Get over there.

49
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,196
...have asked
a number of police officials

50
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,157
for current estimates on
the dead and injured.

51
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,229
This is
a major incident that they're treating

52
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,595
as a possible terrorist attack.

53
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,272
The bomb went off at...

54
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,920
...exactly 4:15 GMT
in Knightsbridge.

55
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,070
One theory on the cause
of the blast,

56
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,072
was that it may have been
a gasoline explosion underground.

57
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,678
How many?
How many I get?

58
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,399
Twelve dead so far,
three times as many injured.

59
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,436
The explosion was centered
at the OBT Bank Branch

60
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,635
in Knightsbridge.

61
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,188
There was no warning,
and police were taken completely by surprise.

62
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,078
Fuck warnings.
That'll teach 'em.

63
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,150
Any problems?

64
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,275
No.

65
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,352
We should be moving.
That's normal procedure.

66
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,556
Every cop, hotel,
and landlady in London

67
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,198
is now looking for the Irishman.

68
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,391
This place is safe,
so long as we stay put.

69
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,518
Would I go to jail if
I murdered your phone?

70
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,036
Destruction of
government property?

71
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,156
Absolutely.

72
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,118
Too bad. What's the time?

73
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,193
Almost 10:00.
Ten more minutes.

74
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,350
I'll miss my flight.

75
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,390
Let's stay here,
door locked, blinds down...

76
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,513
Room service for a week.
Sound good?

77
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,910
And your work, Deputy Minister?

78
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,116
An acute case of food poisoning.

79
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,270
You need to work
on your excuses, darling.

80
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,558
Jesus Christ.

81
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,110
There's been an IRA
bombing in London.

82
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,112
Scores dead and injured.

83
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,075
Yes?

84
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,873
Jesus, Liam.
Half the world's trying to find you.

85
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,518
Do you even know
what's happened?

86
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,874
Yes, yes, yes, I heard.

87
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,275
I've been trying you for hours.
Where've you been?

88
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,115
Meetings.

89
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,111
Meetings?
Aye.

90
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,428
And last night? You didn't come home.
I was worried.

91
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,071
Came in late, left early.
Lot of work to catch up on.

92
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,792
But the guest room
wasn't slept in.

93
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,472
Who said I slept?

94
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,754
Oh, cut the crap, Liam.

95
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,593
You didn't come home,
plain and simple.

96
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,715
And what if I didn't?

97
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,952
Look, I've got a lot
to deal with, okay?

98
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,429
So, don't wait up,
and don't be worried.

99
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,310
Sunday is the 20th anniversary

100
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,119
of my brother's death.

101
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,998
Saint Mary's is dedicating
a mass to him, so...

102
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,676
I'll have Beth put it in the calendar, okay?
We'll talk later.

103
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,909
Oh, Jesus.

104
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,193
Yes, I understand the need
for swift action.

105
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,952
But until we can identify
the threat,

106
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,234
there's not much we can do.

107
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,909
Well, you have your finger on the pulse
over there, Liam.

108
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,194
We're depending on you.

109
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,589
Anything you can provide,
anything at all,

110
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,954
would be a tremendous help.

111
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,712
I'm meeting the Council now.

112
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,633
I'll shake the trees as hard as I can,
and see what falls.

113
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,517
But, Kate, this is crucial.

114
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,353
We've managed to keep the lid on this
for 19 years now.

115
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,476
But there are new upstarts
in the ranks

116
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,516
pressing for the way
things were.

117
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,158
I could use something now.

118
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,631
And you know
what I'm referring to.

119
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,792
The Royal Pardons.

120
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,916
I remember your list,
the 40 On-the-Runs.

121
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,115
Are we really back to that?

122
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,156
My cousin's on that list.

123
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,596
He hasn't even been convicted
of any paramilitary offenses.

124
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,955
These people are suspects
in many things,

125
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,268
including murder.

126
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,670
These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.

127
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,869
A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.

128
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,757
We keep it quiet.

129
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,273
But knowing it's been considered

130
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,555
gives me leeway
to press certain men

131
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,232
for something in return.

132
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,711
As Irish Deputy Minister,

133
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,677
you have served the British Government
honorably,

134
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,478
which hasn't always been easy,

135
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,676
but appeasement
is a dangerous thing.

136
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,751
These are longstanding issues.

137
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,871
That if addressed now,
would smack of appeasement.

138
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,439
I need something, Kate.

139
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,431
The newer members
haven't lived the bloodshed,

140
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,873
and are easily swayed.

141
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,916
I'm trying to
hold this together.

142
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,913
A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.

143
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,796
I'll consider it.

144
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,475
But I want something first.
Something real.

145
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,558
Understood.

146
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,269
Hello?

147
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,555
We're closed.
We open at 12:00.

148
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,473
Uh, we're looking for the owner,
a Mr. Quin Minh?

149
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,714
Quan.

150
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,439
Upstairs.

151
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,589
They were found on site,

152
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,114
not far from
your daughter's body.

153
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,317
Can you positively
identify them as hers?

154
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,633
Who did this?

155
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,919
I don't know, sir.
We don't know,

156
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,558
but we're going to find out.

157
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,191
Why my daughter?

158
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,319
Is there someone we can call
to come and be with you, Mr. Quan?

159
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,908
I have no more family.

160
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,599
These bombers,
will you catch them?

161
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,908
Yes.

162
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,552
Will they get punished?

163
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,552
Yes, they certainly will.

164
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,677
We'll let ourselves out.

165
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,795
Ah, good morning, Hugh.
Thanks for coming.

166
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,949
Been a long time, Liam.

167
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,268
It's been a long time, indeed.

168
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,316
Go on, take a chair, there.

169
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,879
All right, Hugh?

170
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,350
Now, that we're all here,

171
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,189
does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?

172
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,631
Are they even part of the IRA?

173
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,236
Some new upstarts,
or something else entirely? Hmm?

174
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,918
They're trying to
undermine everything

175
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,837
we've achieved
over the last 19 years.

176
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,512
Well, I won't have it.

177
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,593
They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.

178
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,070
Our mandate's to uphold
that choice

179
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,151
and maintain the Peace Accord,
no matter what.

180
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,355
Are we in agreement?

181
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,477
There's a lot of support for their actions
amongst the younger ranks.

182
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,152
Hotheads.

183
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,073
Hotheads who don't remember,
or know any better.

184
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,628
You were once one of
those hotheads, Liam.

185
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,919
Aye. Long ago, when it was the only way.
And what did it give us?

186
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,798
More graves
than I care to remember.

187
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,191
This bombing rivals Omagh
with its civilian deaths.

188
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,955
It's unacceptable,
anytime, anywhere!

189
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,235
And do you think the bombers come
from our ranks?

190
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,515
The Brits ID'd the explosive.

191
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,199
Czech-made Semtex
from our dumps.

192
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,320
They also used our code word.

193
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,994
Which means they have a contact
in our command.

194
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,989
Maybe someone in this room.

195
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,631
They're trying to divide us,

196
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,517
put the Brits back
on the streets again,

197
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,238
stir up the troubles
all over again.

198
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,548
Well, I won't have it!

199
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,189
I want a complete check
of all the arms dumps here and abroad,

200
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,159
everything verified,
guns, Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.

201
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,872
Jesus, you can't be serious.

202
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,313
Never been more so, Patty.

203
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,716
We check 'em,
and if something's missing,

204
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,394
we trace it back to those
who knew the location.

205
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,920
And then we deal
with this internally.

206
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,508
Unless someone here's got
a better idea.

207
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,352
What do we get in return?

208
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,032
Peace.

209
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,278
Is that so bad, Brennan?

210
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,598
Haven't you paid enough
in family blood?

211
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,708
So, unless you all want to
trash what we have,

212
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,155
I need your full support
and respect.

213
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,596
I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,

214
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,908
along with their locations,

215
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,752
and everyone who knows
where they are.

216
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,389
And no fuckin' exceptions!

217
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,792
Show me.

218
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,598
We backtracked 47 minutes.

219
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,193
Clearly anticipated the CCTV.

220
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,113
He circled London for quite some time
prior to the bombing.

221
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,270
Now, this is the first
CC feed we have on him.

222
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,319
Heading southbound on the A413 near Wendover
at 10:53 am.

223
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,115
We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.

224
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,873
It was reported stolen
in Reading the night before.

225
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,270
The license plates
were also stolen from another bike in Reading.

226
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,839
What about phone calls?

227
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,115
Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,

228
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,634
we've dumped the five closest towers
to the blast zone,

229
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,154
trying to ID any call terminating at the time
of the incident.

230
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,838
Sorry. Excuse me.

231
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,239
Yup.

232
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,079
For you.

233
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,195
Bromley.

234
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,474
He's here again, sir.

235
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,596
The Chinese man.
What?

236
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,717
The Chinaman.
It's five days in a row, now.

237
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,478
Christ. Tell him I'm busy.

238
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,472
I did, and he said
he'd wait, again.

239
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,193
I assure you,

240
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,158
this investigation
is our top priority, Mr. Quan.

241
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,311
And we're doing all we can
and pursuing every possible lead

242
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,913
to find those who killed
your daughter.

243
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,913
But they're a difficult people
to catch.

244
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,355
And it may take some time.

245
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,998
I need you to understand that.

246
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,548
You must catch these men,
Commander Bromley.

247
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,598
Again, it's our top priority.

248
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,910
Twenty-thousand pound.

249
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,436
All I have for the names
of the bombers.

250
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,792
I'm sorry,
but we can't take this.

251
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,359
Then please tell me...

252
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,753
Just give me the name
of someone in the IRA.

253
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,354
To be clear,
these are vicious men

254
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,635
who take pride
in their atrocities.

255
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,874
Any attempt by you
to contact them is likely to end very badly.

256
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,317
This is our work, not yours.
You need to be patient.

257
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,669
How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?

258
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,991
Since 1984.
I'm a British citizen.

259
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,995
You were born in Guangxi, China.

260
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,594
Yes. I'm Chinese Nung.

261
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,234
I work in Saigon after the war.

262
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,833
We escaped to Singapore.

263
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,951
Then we immigrate here.

264
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,631
You had two daughters
before Fan.

265
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,359
Both killed during the escape.

266
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,919
And your wife?

267
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,877
Where is she now?

268
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,037
She died, giving birth to Fan.

269
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,831
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

270
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,038
But you mustn't keep coming here
on a daily basis.

271
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,311
It doesn't help,

272
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,870
and diverts time and resources
from our investigation.

273
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,558
Do you understand?

274
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,554
Yes. I understand.

275
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,711
Thank you for seeing me,
Commander Bromley.

276
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,075
After three weeks
of investigations,

277
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,152
there's little in the way of solid leads
that I'm aware of.

278
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,390
The public is looking
for reassurance.

279
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,997
One leading politician
who somberly may have answers,

280
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,958
lies uncomfortably
at the center of this storm.

281
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,713
We go now, to an interview
I recorded earlier in Belfast

282
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,597
with Deputy Minister
Liam Hennessy.

283
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,476
Deputy Minister Hennessy,
you've publicly condemned the bombings.

284
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,070
Yet, as a former leader
of Sinn Féin, and a member of the IRA,

285
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,879
you took part in
similar events years ago.

286
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,155
What's the essential
difference between

287
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,231
those acts
you were involved in then,

288
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,271
and what's happened
in London recently?

289
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,554
Hope.

290
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,468
We had none, just years of vengeance.

291
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,357
We needed to break the cycle,

292
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,398
so, we committed to a political path,
which led to...

293
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,952
So, if you say "hope,"

294
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,237
why are these IRA men,
who come from your own ranks,

295
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,231
returning to the violence?

296
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,595
I can say with
reasonable certainty,

297
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,915
that the IRA are not
behind this.

298
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,231
They stand firmly behind the agreement
and the promises...

299
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,552
It creates a hotbed
for opportunists.

300
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,279
So, you're saying
possibly it's a financial problem,

301
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,952
rather than a political one.

302
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,869
People look for scapegoats,
for a way out.

303
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,396
And for some, they are more than happy
to resort to violence,

304
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,471
to upset the status quo.

305
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,911
Prepared for your signature.
They absolutely must be signed now.

306
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,230
What's the latest reaction
on social media?

307
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,550
Same as before.
Fear and anger.

308
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,272
Anger directed at whom?

309
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,237
From the Prime Minister on down.

310
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,675
CNN and The Irish Times
want interviews with you.

311
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,637
You can do tonight,
or tomorrow morning at 8:00.

312
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,280
Tomorrow morning by phone.
What else?

313
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,431
You've a call waitin'
on line two.

314
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,555
Waiting?

315
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,755
For 30 minutes, now.

316
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,832
A Mr. Quan from London,
very insistent.

317
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,353
What does he want?

318
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,998
His daughter was killed
in the bombing.

319
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,553
I tried my best to console him,

320
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,198
but he really just wants
to speak to you.

321
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,111
He saw you on TV.

322
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,349
Oh, Christ, Beth.

323
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,954
Civic duty.
Take it and be done.

324
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,913
This is Liam Hennessy.
How may I help you?

325
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,750
What on Earth makes you think
I know who killed your daughter?

326
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,788
Because, you are
the First Deputy Minister

327
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,668
and the advisor to Sinn Féin,
and a former IRA member.

328
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,279
I am truly sad for your loss, Mr. Quan.
I have a daughter myself.

329
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,477
And I condemn these acts of violence,
but I can't help you.

330
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,916
Then please tell me someone
who might know the names of the bombers,

331
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,309
someone I can talk to.

332
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,029
I don't have any connections
to those sorts of people. I'm sorry.

333
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,190
I don't believe you,
Mr. Hennessy.

334
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,072
You are very powerful man.

335
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,311
Well, I work for the government
and our elected officials.

336
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,709
I do not work for terrorists.

337
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,836
IRA politics and terrorism

338
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,593
are different ends
of the same snake.

339
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,319
Whichever end you grab,
you still grab a snake.

340
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,994
It makes a great deal
of difference which end you grab,

341
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,310
because one end will bite.

342
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,831
Again, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Quan.
Good day.

343
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,509
Quan!

344
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,918
You have a room?

345
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,430
These are important documents
that we must have today.

346
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,431
Yes, I will keep trying
the sender,

347
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,112
because apparently,
there's nothing else I can do,

348
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,273
which I find strange, and certainly not the service
I've come to expect.

349
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,352
Yes, 329174-N for November.

350
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,677
You tell your supervisor
I'll be calling back.

351
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,519
Good day.

352
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,199
Yes? May I help you?

353
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,669
Please, I would like to
speak to Mr. Hennessy.

354
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,988
And your name?

355
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,274
Ngoc Minh Quan.

356
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,479
You're the one
who's been phoning.

357
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,596
Yes. I phoned many times.

358
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,197
I'm afraid the Deputy Minister is busy,
and won't be able to see you.

359
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,389
I will wait.

360
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,152
No, you must leave.

361
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,676
Best do as the lady says.

362
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,149
He's been phoning up at all hours,
asking for Liam.

363
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,355
He won't take no for an answer.

364
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,714
Just groceries.

365
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,240
Go now, before we make you.

366
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,388
- No. I'm wait.
- Right.

367
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,910
It's the man who's been
phoning you from London.

368
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,197
He's got a knife on him.
One of those Swiss Army types.

369
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,548
Well, take it off him.

370
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,871
Jesus, how much damage
can he do with you two around?

371
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,076
Let him be.

372
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,436
As I explained before,
I don't know who the bombers are.

373
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,671
I realize you're angry,
but there's not much I can do.

374
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,355
It's also very dangerous
for you to be here.

375
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,069
People in Belfast won't take kindly
to your accusations.

376
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,199
If you do not know who they are,

377
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,999
I would like you
to please find out.

378
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,240
I haven't been affiliated
with the IRA for 30 years.

379
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,756
When I was, I fought hard
against the violence.

380
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,354
I went to prison for what I did,
and paid my debt.

381
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,553
Now, I serve the politics
of both sides,

382
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,474
trying to heal the wounds
and bridge the divide.

383
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,155
Again, my sincere condolences,

384
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,390
but there's nothing I can do.

385
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,519
What if your wife and daughter were killed
by bomb?

386
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,312
I'd do everything
in my power to get justice.

387
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,279
So, I've chosen you,
Mr. Hennessy.

388
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,749
You will tell me
who killed my child.

389
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,668
Again, I don't know.

390
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,519
You will change your mind.

391
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,799
Thank you for seeing me,
First Minister Hennessy.

392
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,035
I'm sorry, Liam.
He took me by surprise.

393
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,879
You're okay, Beth.
Okay, you're okay.

394
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,837
Take her, take her.

395
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,673
Murphy, have the boys check the building.
Right.

396
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,079
Jesus.

397
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,916
Would you like
a whiskey, Inspector?

398
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,991
No, thank you.

399
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,197
I suppose it would be
a waste of time

400
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,508
asking who might've done this.

401
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,677
No one comes to mind.

402
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,794
Well, it appears to have been
nothing more than a warning.

403
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,474
Fortunately,
it wasn't a serious bomb.

404
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,553
If it had been, we wouldn't be here talking,
would we?

405
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,760
Feel free to reach out,
should you have the unexpected urge.

406
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,912
I'll feed the press a gas leak story
in the meantime.

407
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,675
Fair enough.
Thanks very much, Inspector.

408
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,629
Hello?

409
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,311
It's him.

410
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,597
You come to my office
and plant a fucking bomb?

411
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,795
Have you changed your mind?

412
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,949
Changed my mind?

413
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,917
Are you out of
your fuckin' tree?

414
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,595
You have no idea who you're dealing with,
but you'll soon find out.

415
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,829
Give me the names.

416
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,514
I 'II tell you what.
Let's meet face-to-face.

417
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,079
We'll settle...

418
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,999
The fuckin' wanker
threatened me and hung up.

419
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,718
Right. Let's check all the hotels
and guest houses.

420
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,518
He won't be hard to find.

421
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,034
Fuckin' Chinaman.

422
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,997
Uncle Liam?
What's up?

423
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,633
I'll be there.

424
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,113
Stop! Hold it, hold it, hold it!
Don't move!

425
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,273
Don't move!
She's wired to blow!

426
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,230
Two sets of wires
10-foot long.

427
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,118
Soldered to that light bulb and covered with
ground-up match heads.

428
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,035
Gives an extra kick.

429
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,796
Not needed, but a nice touch.
Crude, effective, and easy to spot.

430
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,313
So, he wanted us to see it.

431
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,914
Well, it wasn't in the tank,
so, it wouldn't have worked.

432
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,596
He just wants you to know he can get to you.

433
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,509
Micky.

434
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,959
We found him.

435
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,837
A B&B in Wellington Park.

436
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,431
They found him.
Grab him.

437
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,274
Drag him out of Belfast.
Discourage him from returning.

438
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,554
Wait for me.
I'm on my way.

439
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,112
Hello.

440
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,509
I hear your office was bombed.

441
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,036
Hardly.
It was the toilet in the hall.

442
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,839
An Asian man
in his 60s with a grudge.

443
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,273
It's all being taken care of.

444
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,588
Why'd he do it?

445
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,676
His child died
in the bank bombing.

446
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,875
He thinks I know who did it.

447
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,235
He's not the only one
of that mind.

448
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,271
So, where are we
with the pardons?

449
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,952
Lots of resistance.

450
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,632
But if you give us
something useful,

451
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,551
things might turn in your favor.

452
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,438
I have a lead.
I'm pursuing it.

453
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,996
Well, let's hope it bears fruit.
People here want heads.

454
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,833
The dogs won't stay leashed
much longer.

455
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,398
Top floor on the right.

456
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,508
Fuckin' get him!

457
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,272
Christ Almighty,
are you dumb and blind?

458
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,555
An old man making fools
out of the lot of you,

459
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,359
and he's still running around out there,
for God's sake.

460
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,670
You are four men. Four.

461
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,716
We had him cornered,
then he jumped off the roof

462
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,558
and slid down like
some fuckin' monkey.

463
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,789
What is goin' on?

464
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,960
Pack your bag.
You're going to the farm.

465
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,475
Go on.

466
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,229
Get your things.

467
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,716
You all right, Sean?
Hi, Christy.

468
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,553
Go on through,
he's expecting you.

469
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,035
Beat you up.

470
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,395
Come on in and have a drink,
for God's sake.

471
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,152
Well, look at you.

472
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,071
Jesus, the place looks well.
It's not bad, is it?

473
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,156
No.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

474
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,798
So, how is New York
treatin' you?

475
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,791
Ah. It's cold.

476
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,989
Uh-huh.

477
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,916
Look, Murphy filled me in, there.
That bloody Chinaman.

478
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,037
He set off
a bomb in my office, put one in my Jag,

479
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,111
and beat the bejesus
out of Mick and Jimmy.

480
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,270
Do you want me to handle him?

481
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,796
No. That's Kavanagh's
problem.

482
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,592
I need your help
with the London bombing.

483
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,430
Any idea who's behind it yet?

484
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,316
Not at all.

485
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,556
- Well, the Yanks aren't happy, Liam.
- Mmm...

486
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,278
Dead women and kids
all over the news.

487
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,873
Any fundraising now
is impossible.

488
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,793
Yeah, this is not
about fundraising, Sean.

489
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,156
I need you to go to London
and meet someone...

490
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,789
A Richard Bromley in SO15.

491
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,035
SO15?

492
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,156
He needs to know
the bombings aren't ours,

493
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,196
and that we're working
the problem hard,

494
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,759
but we need his help.

495
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,829
Why me?

496
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,230
You're a decorated Ranger
in the Royal Irish Regiment.

497
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,359
Bromley will respect you as much as he's capable
of respecting any of us.

498
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,713
Should anyone find out
that we're talking to the Brits,

499
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,190
to go after one of
our own, rogue or not,

500
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,959
there'll be the devil to pay.

501
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,838
So, can I count on you, Sean,

502
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,436
to be discreet?

503
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,238
Of course.

504
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,195
Right this way, sir.

505
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,679
Thank you very much.

506
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,836
You took your time.

507
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,117
I just had to put out
the odd fire here and there.

508
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,989
I'll be back in a minute.
I'll be right here.

509
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,914
Jesus.

510
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,914
Mr. Morrison.

511
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,719
Commander Bromley.

512
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,877
We're not responsible.
Really?

513
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,117
Forensic evidence and the use of your code word
suggests otherwise.

514
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,873
It's a renegade unit.
We don't know who they are yet.

515
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,030
You're telling me there's an active
IRA unit on the loose

516
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,189
you know nothing about?

517
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,315
Yes, I am.

518
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,238
And the Semtex?

519
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,548
They're raiding our dumps.

520
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,830
Dumps that were all
given up for the Accord?

521
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,753
And your code word?

522
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,798
They're being helped by someone in our command,
Belfast or Dublin.

523
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,518
So, what do you want,
Mr. Morrison?

524
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,759
We've a plan.

525
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,274
Different codes will be given to each member
of command.

526
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,998
When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,

527
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,389
you'll tell us
which word they use.

528
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,311
Then we'll know who gave the orders
and then we end it.

529
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,913
Who else is involved
in this plan?

530
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,592
Liam Hennessy.

531
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,069
So, you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

532
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,832
Only Liam knows who will be given
which word.

533
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,599
So, Hennessy will personally work with us
to take out an IRA cell?

534
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,795
A rogue cell.

535
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,512
Your people, nonetheless.

536
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,791
I've one condition.

537
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,758
When Hennessy finds the bombers,
he tells me directly.

538
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,594
Then we take them down.
Not you.

539
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,750
This is non-negotiable.

540
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,711
We found some
plastic bags in his room.

541
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,634
Based on what I saw,
he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,

542
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,395
mixed it with weed killer,
packed it into some plastic plumbing pipes.

543
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,158
How much damage can he do?

544
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,151
I'm guessing
he's made four bombs,

545
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,673
each enough to blow up a lorry.

546
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,829
Jesus.

547
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,832
Knows what he's doing.
I've half the city looking for him.

548
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,992
When he surfaces in Belfast,
we'll find him.

549
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,593
You'll be safe here.

550
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,073
Aye. I wouldn't count on it.

551
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,548
Benny!

552
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,796
Jesus Christ!

553
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,553
Move it! Move it!

554
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,553
Jesus.

555
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,791
He roughed up Benny and Sean.
They'll be fine.

556
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,036
Get more men from Belfast.

557
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,556
I've underestimated him.
It won't happen again.

558
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,028
It's another warning, Liam?

559
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,396
Aye.
Nothing I can't handle.

560
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,311
First Belfast, now here.

561
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,550
How in God's name
are you handling anything?

562
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,949
The problem's being dealt with.

563
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,270
He is destroying
our farmhouse...

564
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,238
Intent on God knows what,
and you're calling it a problem?

565
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,394
God, you can be
so pompous sometimes.

566
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,074
I'm leaving for London.
Gonna stay at Keri's.

567
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,479
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

568
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,915
Well, I wasn't asking
for your permission.

569
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,230
He's hardly likely to know
about our daughter's flat,

570
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,436
and besides, it's you he's after,
not me.

571
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,476
Well, the point is,
if he knows about the farmhouse,

572
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,473
I assume he knows about Keri's flat.
It's not worth the risk.

573
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,068
Well, then, you're just
gonna have to handle it, like you said.

574
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,589
I remember a time when you would've
dealt with this, properly,

575
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,035
and other things, too.

576
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,633
But those days are gone.

577
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,594
Weighs a bit more,
but shouldn't be noticeable.

578
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,552
All I'm adding is the Semtex,
a micro-chip, and a few inches of wire.

579
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,069
It looks good.

580
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,832
Tricky part will be getting it
through the scanner,

581
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,309
but we'll find a way.

582
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,829
And if it's turned on?

583
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,114
Shorter battery life,
but it'll work, no problem.

584
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,599
Any idea which plane yet?

585
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,829
No.

586
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,480
We don't want to hit a flight
with any Irish on board.

587
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,437
One in the queen's fleet'd
be best.

588
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,953
We just need the right mule.

589
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,912
Code word has changed

590
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,153
as of tonight.

591
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,315
My news editor's
a complete twat.

592
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,828
Spends as much
on a pair of shoes

593
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,150
as I get for eight hours
writing crap like this.

594
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,229
Makes perfect sense.

595
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,474
Who doesn't like
a new pair of sexy shoes?

596
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,551
You should try a real whiskey.

597
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,834
Two Jamesons, single malt.

598
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,517
"Wife Attacks Husband's
Transgender Lover."

599
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,636
Some serious news
you're writing there.

600
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,473
Well, if it pays, I'll write it.

601
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,312
Beats being knee-deep
in a bloody bomb site.

602
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,913
So, what do you do?

603
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,274
Wealth management.

604
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,353
I'm Maggie.
Ian.

605
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,633
All right.
I'll call if we need more.

606
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,709
Thanks, Mary.

607
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,797
Six more men are on their way
from Belfast.

608
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,869
When they get here,

609
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,678
they'll relieve the fellas
who've been up all night.

610
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,034
Is it enough to secure the farm?

611
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,394
Secure as it can be.

612
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,677
It's 20 total
working two shifts.

613
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,716
All right.
You're flying to London today with Mary.

614
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,789
Right, yeah.

615
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,869
That's completely unnecessary.

616
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,150
Get her into Keri's flat,
then move them into a hotel.

617
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,753
I can manage this, all right?

618
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,155
I'll not be debating this!

619
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,276
Nick's gonna fill up the Jag.

620
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,475
You're leaving...

621
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,594
Take him to the hospital.

622
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,033
Get Mary to the airport.

623
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,588
Right.
Go.

624
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,798
Buried nitro bomb,
detonated by remote.

625
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,394
He needed a line of sight.

626
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,630
Those woods,
that's where he'd be.

627
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,949
Go.

628
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,554
Sean! Mick! Get in the car.

629
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,914
Go, go, go!

630
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,394
Come on. Go, go, go!

631
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,435
You guys spread out.
I'll take the high ground.

632
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,552
Names!

633
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,592
Jesus Christ!

634
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,355
One ol' man running circles
around the lot of us.

635
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,634
Why is it so hard?

636
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,551
He's ahead of us every step of the way.
We need more men.

637
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,598
We need 100 more men, at least.

638
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,871
And if we did that,
we'd have the whole of Belfast against us.

639
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,197
Bring in a tracker,
someone who knows the woods,

640
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,032
and beat him at his own game.

641
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,555
My nephew?
Aye.

642
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,438
If you can spare him.

643
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,389
Come on.

644
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,352
How's Keri? Where is she?

645
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,589
Out.

646
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,155
You're a wee bit early,
but I'm nearly ready.

647
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,510
Have you a restaurant in mind?

648
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,591
Haven't given it much thought.

649
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,151
So, what urgencies
bring my nephew all the way to London?

650
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,674
A few personal matters.

651
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,478
I'm glad I made the list.

652
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,591
Mmm. I think that works.
What do you think?

653
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,356
You've gotta be kiddin'.

654
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,355
Liam?

655
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,352
Tell Bromley
I'll accept his terms.

656
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,475
I'll pass it on.

657
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,994
I've given out the code words.
Now, we wait.

658
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,316
Quan hit us again.

659
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,914
Blew up the Jag,
put Billy in the hospital.

660
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,831
Kavanagh and the boys
went after him.

661
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,070
The wee Shitey
injured three more men.

662
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,116
Punji sticks,
if you can believe that.

663
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,111
Liam, it sounds like
he's trained.

664
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,519
Maybe Special Forces.

665
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,953
Which brings me to the point.

666
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,794
I need a tracker, Sean.
Can you give us a hand?

667
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,714
I'll take a morning flight.

668
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,028
Good man.

669
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,319
Hey. How'd he sound?

670
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,353
Worried.

671
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,074
He's got a lot going on.

672
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,355
Well, if he doesn't find the bombers,
the Accord's dead.

673
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,000
And politically, so's he.

674
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,512
Do you think he'll find them?

675
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,794
Yeah, if there's another blast.

676
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,952
The code word will lead us
to who's running them.

677
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,191
He's finished.
The code word won't save him.

678
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,953
What the Council needs
is new blood,

679
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,871
someone stronger like you.

680
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,391
He's afraid to use his power.

681
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,959
He's just a washed-up
old man

682
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,548
trying to hold onto
whatever he can.

683
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,915
I've never forgiven him
for my brother, Patrick.

684
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,676
Liam found out who killed him.

685
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,753
A UVF death squad.
Four men.

686
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,235
I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.

687
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,117
But he said no.

688
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,354
That the time
for revenge is past.

689
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,876
So, my Patrick
is dead and buried,

690
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,952
and they're sitting in jail now,
all four of them,

691
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,679
taking classes
at the open university.

692
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,593
It's not right.

693
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,193
It's not.

694
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,117
Hugh McGrath's here.

695
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,757
I heard you're
checking my dumps.

696
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,190
We're checking everyone's.
No exceptions.

697
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,113
Four came up short.
Two were yours.

698
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,918
Ten kilos of Semtex missing.

699
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,672
What in God's name
are you doing?

700
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,033
My dumps were off-limits.
We were clear in that. Remember?

701
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,553
You were at the meeting.

702
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,710
If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.

703
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,395
They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.

704
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,312
Christ, Liam, so,
the committee knows it's my Semtex?

705
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,951
Don't know who we can trust anymore.
Do we?

706
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,993
Trust, or fear?

707
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,310
In your case, mostly fear.

708
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,635
Simple and brutal,
like my dad taught me.

709
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,513
Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.

710
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,158
This Chinaman
isn't helping matters,

711
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,753
but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.

712
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,751
How much do you know?
Plenty.

713
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,070
Bomb in your office.
Your farm. Your car.

714
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,230
Mary and your daughter
hiding out in a London hotel.

715
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,389
A bloody mess, it is.

716
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,751
And the men sense weakness,
as do the UVF.

717
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,398
You should be back in Belfast,

718
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,550
out in front, taking charge.

719
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,073
Look, I'm no politician...

720
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,832
What're you trying to say?

721
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,038
The bombing.

722
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,596
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

723
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,911
"Encouragement"?
They kill civilians by the buckets.

724
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,712
They went a bit far, I know,

725
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,189
but they have given us
real momentum.

726
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,429
The Brits are on the ropes.

727
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,559
Jesus Christ, I said hit a few financial targets.
That's it.

728
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,872
No one gets hurt. That's what we agreed to.
You gave me your word.

729
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,598
And by God, I kept it.

730
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,116
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

731
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,553
And that's the way it has to be.

732
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,198
Because if something goes wrong,

733
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,793
they could trace 'em
straight back to us.

734
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,871
Go wrong? This wasn't
the fuckin' plan.

735
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,951
I needed this
to get our people back.

736
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,837
You and I have spent
our whole lifetime...

737
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,388
You don't give a shit
about those men!

738
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,914
You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,

739
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,797
to prop up your weakness
in the ranks.

740
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,949
Well, guess what?

741
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,834
In the fog 0' war,
plans fuckin' change.

742
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,553
Now, I stood by you

743
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,790
when you put fire into the lads.

744
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,071
M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.

745
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,195
You were calling for
an escalation then,

746
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,315
right enough.

747
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,914
Those days are long gone!

748
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,071
That's not what I heard
a few months ago.

749
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:47,429
I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.

750
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,713
You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have you?

751
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,150
You question my loyalty?

752
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,478
I buried my brother-in-law,
before that, my da and my two cousins.

753
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,198
We spilt our fair share of blood

754
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,952
struggling for united Ireland,

755
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,116
not profiting off a divided one.

756
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,713
So, don't fucking
go asking me again

757
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,313
if I've forgotten
what we're fighting for.

758
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,039
If there's anyone
profiteering around here, it's you,

759
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:16,035
sitting in your fancy houses,
cozying up to the Brits.

760
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,872
You're not the Liam I once knew.

761
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,552
You want the old me, huh?

762
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,274
The Butcher of the Bogside,
is that what you want?

763
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,429
Well then, hear this.

764
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,909
You reel in those
fuckin' cunts and end it,

765
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,878
or by God,
I'll bury the lot of yas.

766
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,712
Right. I'm going now.

767
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,837
I'll be at my farm
if you need me.

768
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,115
And take care of
that Committee issue.

769
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,669
We don't want them jumping
to the wrong conclusion

770
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,795
about that Semtex.

771
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,915
Do we?

772
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,149
Yeah.

773
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,839
Do you or any of the men know

774
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,069
where Mary's staying in London?

775
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,116
No. No one,
but Murphy.

776
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,829
Hmm. McGrath knows
where she's hiding.

777
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,151
I wanna know how.

778
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,675
What a day, Charlie.

779
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,674
What a day.
Come on now, let's go.

780
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,797
Come on, Charlie, up you get.

781
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,355
Charlie.

782
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,639
You killed my dog.

783
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,156
Dog's fine.
Just sleeping.

784
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,468
Sit.

785
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,389
I'm wearing a bomb.

786
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,676
Anyone comes in,
I touch it one, then we die.

787
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,749
Now, give me the names.

788
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,435
They claim they're the IRA,
but I don't know who they really are.

789
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,829
I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's responsible.

790
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,592
You're lying!
Who killed my daughter?

791
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,752
I'm sorry.
I truly don't know yet.

792
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,793
The explosives the bombers use,
it's Semtex-H?

793
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,590
Yes. Yes.
You know about Semtex?

794
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,351
I know Semtex-H.

795
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,874
During the war,
Czechs make for the Viet Cong.

796
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,552
Good for bombs and traps.

797
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,188
In Vietnam?
Yes.

798
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,033
Many American people died
by Semtex-H.

799
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,199
Now, IRA use
to kill my daughter.

800
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,350
That's ironic.

801
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,993
I've read your history.

802
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,876
We both know about war.
We've both tried to put it behind us.

803
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,951
You and me, we're alike.

804
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,152
We are nothing alike.
You're nothing!

805
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,231
You kill women
and children! Names!

806
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,958
To Almighty God, I don't know!

807
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,229
Wait! Wait.

808
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,515
I've set a trap for them
when they use the next bomb.

809
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,909
When they claim responsibility for
the next bombing,

810
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,391
they'll use a code word,
telling the police they're IRA.

811
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,550
I've changed that code word.

812
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,916
So, when they use it, I'll know.

813
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,159
You have one day.

814
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,116
What if they don't
set off a bomb by then?

815
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,636
Twenty-four hours.

816
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,551
Oh, Jesus.
Jesus, Sweet Jesus.

817
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,599
We missed it the first time.

818
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,270
But ran a reconfiguration
through RAPTOR,

819
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,591
and the image's anomalies and architecture
became more apparent.

820
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,672
Now there, look,
the back of his hand.

821
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,229
Hmm.
Looks like a burn, or a birthmark.

822
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,958
We're running comparatives now.

823
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,316
So, it's a bit more time,
but we'll get it.

824
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,034
Good morning, Sean.
Thanks for coming.

825
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,314
Are you all right?

826
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,198
Well, I've been better.
There's been another bombing.

827
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,474
Yeah, I just heard.

828
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,629
Aye, a London bus.

829
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,789
Has Bromley phoned?

830
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,949
No. Not yet.

831
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,554
McGrath's on his way with some locals.
They'll give you a hand.

832
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,313
No, I don't need them.
I'll handle it.

833
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,515
Good man.

834
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,909
Hennessy.

835
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,549
They called, but didn't give a code word.
What the hell's going on?

836
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,479
Maybe it wasn't them.

837
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,676
Press Association took the call.

838
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,113
A man with an Irish accent said

839
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,758
there'd be no more
fuckin' cooperation

840
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,239
with the Brits,
and no more code words.

841
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,834
He knew exactly which bus,
and how much explosive was used.

842
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,036
And it's been ID'd
as your Semtex again.

843
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:51,510
Either someone talked,
warned them off, or you're playing me.

844
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,273
Only two people knew
what was happening.

845
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,828
Myself and Morrison.

846
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,355
Like I said,
one of you can't be trusted.

847
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,274
Send me a number where
I can reach you day or night.

848
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,920
I'll call the moment
I have something.

849
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,439
It better be soon,

850
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,149
or you'll feel a backlash
the likes of which you've never felt before.

851
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,551
A bus now.

852
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,319
For God's sake, 16 dead,
twice that injured.

853
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,833
I'm sorry.

854
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,992
I had a plan to nail
the bastards. Didn't work.

855
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,113
I've just come
from Downing Street.

856
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,952
The PM will consider
the pardons,

857
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,235
but only if you give up
the bombers immediately.

858
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,749
And how in God's name
do I do that?

859
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,432
Find a way!

860
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,033
Plans are afoot to put
the paratroops

861
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,151
back on your streets
in 48 hours.

862
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,794
Belfast will erupt.
You'll give the bombers

863
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,598
exactly what they want.

864
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,874
Well, it's out of my hands now.

865
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,638
Call when you have something.

866
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,233
I'm heading for a conference
in Rome tomorrow.

867
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,231
I'll have my cell at all times.

868
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:12,471
How was London?
Is Mary okay?

869
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,999
You said to keep an eye on her,

870
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,640
and make sure
she and Keri were kept safe.

871
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,032
I spent some time
in her hotel lobby,

872
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,196
watching the comings
and goings, you know?

873
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,670
She had no idea I was there.

874
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,557
And your nephew turns up.

875
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,429
He spent two hours in her room.

876
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,428
He spent two hours
in Mary's room?

877
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,909
Aye. And after he goes,

878
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,674
Mary comes down,

879
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,638
and calls Hugh McGrath
on the lobby phone.

880
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,754
It's done.

881
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,908
Unless they take it apart,
there's no way to know it's been modified.

882
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,070
Fuckin' brilliant.
What'll set it off?

883
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,391
The internal clock.
I'll input the time once we know the flight.

884
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,795
There's a security conference
in Rome tomorrow.

885
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,155
All the top MPs and security people
are flying there

886
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,196
on three lunchtime flights.
Perfect.

887
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,509
What about our mule?

888
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,799
Sara just confirmed he's going.

889
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,190
We then ran the burn-mark
through the database.

890
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,989
We got a positive hit on a Patrick O'Reilly,
age 29, from Belfast.

891
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,036
O'Reilly had one prior for
a domestic abuse incident three years back.

892
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,798
Did two months in Hydebank.

893
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,198
We entered O'Reilly
into the facial rec bank for matches.

894
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,872
We got a hit.

895
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,795
That's him in a Dublin pub
with an IRA member four weeks ago.

896
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,233
It's a known IRA meeting place

897
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,719
we've had
under surveillance for years.

898
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,789
And the other two with him?

899
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,791
I was about to get
to them, Minister.

900
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,271
That, and a woman
we've just ID'd at the bus explosion.

901
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,674
Yes.

902
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,030
Your mole's Hugh McGrath.

903
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,230
Did you hear me, Hennessy?

904
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,799
Are you sure now?

905
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,871
Quite.

906
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,353
We've ID'd
the Knightsbridge bomber

907
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,396
as Patrick O'Reilly of Belfast.

908
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,436
Three weeks ago,
Mr. O'Reilly was observed

909
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,988
meeting Hugh McGrath
in a Dublin pub.

910
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,992
Where's McGrath
and O'Reilly now?

911
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,596
I don't know O'Reilly.
I haven't seen McGrath.

912
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,274
Let me help you with McGrath.

913
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:55,069
His phone's GPS puts him 52 meters
south of you.

914
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,435
I'm watching him
coming up your drive.

915
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,593
So, let's cut the shit.

916
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,512
There's a Chinook airborne right now,
with a 12-man team.

917
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,953
They'll land on your farm
in 30 minutes

918
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,837
to take McGrath into custody.

919
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,194
I needn't tell you
how that'll go,

920
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,829
nor how your cozy relationship with him
will sink your career...

921
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,319
This time, for good.

922
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,348
Or?

923
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,755
Question McGrath your way
and get what I need.

924
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,677
Names and locations of everyone.

925
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,155
You can't save him,
but maybe you can save yourself.

926
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,710
Thirty minutes, get what I need,
I'll turn them around.

927
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,755
Jim.

928
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,398
Send McGrath's men to the trailhead,
see if Sean needs any help.

929
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,388
Give me your phone.

930
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,711
What the hell?
Give me your phone.

931
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,351
Get your ass
in that chair there.

932
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,156
A London bus, for Christ sake!
Now, hold on!

933
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,389
Not even fuckin' warnings!

934
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,398
Sixteen dead!

935
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,358
You stabbed me in the back
and sanctioned this bloodbath

936
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,919
to get your war back on.

937
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,355
The plan had no balls.

938
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,670
This wasn't
a Bombing Light campaign.

939
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,876
You said hurt 'em,
and hurt 'em, we did.

940
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,076
By killing women and children?

941
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,358
You can't restrain yourself.
You never could. Well, it's over.

942
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,149
Their names, aliases,
and location!

943
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,474
You know I can't do that!

944
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,558
That's me being nice.

945
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,438
Now, write, and it better match
what I already know.

946
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,354
By God, I'll take you apart
joint by joint!

947
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,674
You used me.

948
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,916
You wanted the pardons
for your own political gain.

949
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,275
You're a disgrace to the cause!

950
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,837
Four men and a woman.

951
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,438
Maggie Dunn?

952
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,030
Aye. You call her that.

953
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,554
Sara McKay's her real name.

954
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,475
She works for you?

955
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,869
Bloody right.
Checks and balances.

956
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,274
An insurance policy,
in case you lose your nerve,

957
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,634
which you have.

958
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,393
So, now, if they take the lads,

959
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:26,834
she will lead them
straight back to you.

960
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,150
Not so easy anymore, now, is it?

961
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,672
SO15 will be here
in 20 minutes to take you in.

962
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,876
We both know that can't happen.

963
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:41,191
You gave me up to the Brits?

964
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,829
You tout bastard!

965
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,150
You gave yourself up.

966
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,994
They've got surveillance
of you in an IRA pub with a Pat O'Reilly,

967
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,275
who they ID'd
as the Knightsbridge bomber.

968
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,636
And thanks to your GPS phone,
they tracked you here.

969
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,430
You broke every rule, Hughie.

970
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,270
And now, I'm left
to clean up your mess

971
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,715
as I have for the past 30 years.

972
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,793
A final thing.

973
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:17,829
My wife?

974
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,959
What about her?

975
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:31,875
She hates you
because of her brother.

976
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,235
And so, she reached out to me.

977
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,552
So, yes, I helped her.

978
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,279
And she helped me.

979
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,390
- Yes.
- Bromley.

980
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,992
I got your names.

981
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,597
Oh, shit, I'm late.
I've got to go.

982
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,228
Did you come?

983
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,548
No.

984
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,915
I'm not a three-second wonder
like you.

985
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,792
Well, keep wearing that shirt,
I'll be a two-second wonder.

986
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,990
You're gonna have to
get used to it.

987
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,920
Practice, practice, practice.

988
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,828
I'm close.

989
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:33,118
McGrath confessed.
It was his op all along.

990
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,316
I've got the bombers'
names and location.

991
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,834
I 'II text you the info.
You may need it.

992
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,992
The one who killed Quan's daughter
is Pat O'Reilly.

993
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,475
He's got a burn-mark
on his right hand.

994
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:48,588
Either way, Sean,
you end this, now.

995
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,077
You know why you're still alive?

996
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,878
You want the names?

997
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:36,034
They're in the phone.
The last text, code 7741.

998
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,952
Five names and their
location in London.

999
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,554
O'Reilly set the bomb
that killed your daughter.

1000
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,310
He's got a burn-mark
on his right hand.

1001
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,152
You fought in the army.

1002
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,756
Iraq. Royal Irish Regiment.

1003
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,273
Two tours, Special Forces.

1004
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,115
You're Catholic, but you fought
for British. Why?

1005
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,993
I fought for the regiment.

1006
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,638
Out there,
religion didn't matter.

1007
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:10,075
We were all the same.
That's it.

1008
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,948
Family?

1009
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,919
A brother.

1010
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,278
The rest have passed away.

1011
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,790
Come in.

1012
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,319
Take a seat, Sean.

1013
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,676
Aye. You look like you've been through
the wars.

1014
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,719
Aye. Quan got the drop
on me.

1015
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,558
I gave him the names,
he took my things and let me go.

1016
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,837
When the bombers
called in about the bus,

1017
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,229
they didn't use a code word,

1018
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,470
because someone tipped them off.

1019
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:34,593
Only two people knew the reason
for the code change.

1020
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,240
You and me.

1021
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,753
Liam, I didn't tell anyone.
I swear.

1022
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,592
I spoke to Bromley,
and that was it.

1023
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,519
What if I told you I had Murphy

1024
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,036
stay and watch Mary in London?

1025
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,870
My own flesh and blood.

1026
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,599
Liam, I'm so sorry.

1027
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:58,070
I don't wanna know what happened
in that room.

1028
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,390
All I wanna know is,

1029
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:05,429
what was discussed
when your sweet Aunt Mary was with you?

1030
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,034
Did she say she was involved with McGrath
and the bombers?

1031
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,912
No. Never.

1032
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,195
She was upset about her brother and kept on
about that.

1033
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,793
When you and I were talking
about the code word,

1034
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,950
she asked about 'em,
but she never let on about McGrath.

1035
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,270
Oh, so, she could
hear us on the phone?

1036
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,476
No, it was only after our call she mentioned
the code word.

1037
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,754
She thought
they wouldn't be of use.

1038
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,478
So, she steered
the conversation?

1039
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,592
Well, yes, I guess she did.

1040
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,792
Ah. A good manipulator,
she is.

1041
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:29,949
So, she told the bombers?

1042
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,793
She told McGrath,
McGrath told them.

1043
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,155
Thick as thieves, they were.

1044
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,438
She tricked the information
out of you, Sean.

1045
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,670
She used you.

1046
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,559
Liam, I...
Shut up!

1047
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,150
Bury that pig
in the sow-pen.

1048
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,994
And after that, I have
one final task for you.

1049
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,833
And when that's done,

1050
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,072
go back to New York, son.

1051
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,119
Thank you.

1052
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,313
Zero, this is Alpha Two.
Echo One toward target house.

1053
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,392
Zero.
Echo One's toward the target house. Copy.

1054
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,119
Echo One has
entered the target house and unsighted to me.

1055
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,277
Zero. Echo One is in target house
and unsighted to you. Copy.

1056
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,555
Thank Christ for that.

1057
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,755
Sierra call signs.

1058
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,229
Confirm when Echo One
is complete in target house.

1059
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,912
Sierra Two, roger that.

1060
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,992
Sierra Three, roger that.

1061
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,273
X-Ray One on balcony.

1062
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,797
Echo One approaching front door.

1063
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,671
How'd it go?

1064
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,557
It's done.

1065
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,079
I have visual.
X-Ray One and Echo One have left the room.

1066
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,832
All other X-Rays remain.

1067
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,634
Zero, this is Alpha Two.

1068
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,278
One unknown Echo
and two children

1069
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,469
entering the target house.

1070
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,675
Roger that.

1071
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,159
He's a slobbering oaf.

1072
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,429
It had to be done.

1073
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,839
I had to shag him.
It was fuckin' disgusting.

1074
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,115
Look, I know what you went through.
All right?

1075
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,589
Do ya, Denis?
Do ya really?

1076
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,715
Well, maybe, for the next bomb,

1077
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:47,915
you can set up a gay Magistrate.

1078
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,797
How would that be?

1079
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,438
Taking a shower.

1080
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,949
Next.

1081
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,552
X-Ray One
entering living room.

1082
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,794
All X-Rays now complete
in living room.

1083
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,555
All call signs, move to
your final rendezvous.

1084
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:05,113
X-Rays and Echo complete
in living room.

1085
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,911
We've lost visual.
Echo One has closed the blinds.

1086
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,877
Fox One, you have control.

1087
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,669
Roger that.
I have control. Standby. Standby.

1088
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,199
Stop, stop, stop!

1089
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,474
Wait!

1090
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,909
Sierra call signs,
report what's going on.

1091
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,956
I've two unknowns
at the front door. Wait.

1092
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:45,350
Sorry for the bother, but there's a gas leak
in the building,

1093
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,954
and the gas man needs entry
for an inspection.

1094
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,157
Our gas works fine!
There's no problem!

1095
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,836
He needs to inspect
all the flats, regardless.

1096
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,798
He won't take a moment,
and it is an emergency.

1097
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,839
It's quite important,
Mr. Upton.

1098
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,514
By law, I'm allowed
to use my own key.

1099
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,910
All right. Just a second.

1100
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,268
Come down when you're done,
and I'll take you to the next flat.

1101
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,032
Thank you.
I will be very fast.

1102
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,914
This way.

1103
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,274
Can I see the boiler, please?

1104
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,555
Would you mind putting your bag
on the table?

1105
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:08,993
Open it up.

1106
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,115
All right.

1107
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,876
All call signs,
standby, standby!

1108
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,913
All call signs, go!

1109
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,712
Get down! Get down!

1110
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,917
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1111
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,795
Room clear!

1112
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:52,954
X-Rays down.

1113
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,189
What about Echo?

1114
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:57,033
She's alive, under control.

1115
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,589
Who planned this?

1116
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,439
Go fuck yourself.

1117
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,837
What's this, eh?
Your next bomb?

1118
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,114
Go fuck yourself.

1119
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,399
Talk, you rotten slag!

1120
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,993
It's too late.

1121
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,199
Nine minutes, it blows.
No time to land.

1122
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,269
What's that?

1123
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,714
A plane? Which plane?

1124
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,718
Which plane?

1125
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:37,995
Open her shirt.

1126
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,754
This is how it works.

1127
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:52,196
I ask questions.
You answer.

1128
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,950
That's right.
Flight 136 to Rome.

1129
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,909
Passenger name Ian Wood.
Bomb's in his laptop.

1130
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,634
Set to go off
at 3:00 p.m. exactly.

1131
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,995
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be advised.

1132
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:07,470
Flight 136 to Rome
has been overly delayed.

1133
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,357
We apologize for
the inconvenience.

1134
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,158
Again, Flight 136 to Rome...

1135
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,959
Ian Wood!
Is there an Ian Wood here?

1136
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,554
Ian Wood! Ian Wood?

1137
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:20,513
Is there an Ian Wood here?
Ian Wood?

1138
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,034
Ian Wood! Ian Wood!

1139
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,590
What's going on?
What's going on?

1140
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,557
They're looking for someone
named Ian Wood.

1141
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:33,074
That's me.
I'm Ian Wood.

1142
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:34,673
Ian Wood!

1143
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,637
I'm Ian Wood.

1144
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:38,990
Is that your laptop?
Yeah.

1145
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,236
Move! Move! Move!

1146
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:45,874
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

1147
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:50,352
Get down! Get out!

1148
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:58,352
Get outta the way! Get out! Move here!
Get out!

1149
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,873
Move!

1150
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,914
She said a gas man turned up

1151
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,434
with an assault gun, a Chinaman.

1152
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,112
Started shooting,
killed everyone but her,

1153
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,758
and then walked out the door.

1154
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,512
She said he was a Chinaman?

1155
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,352
Affirmative.
About 60 years old.

1156
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,351
Just got word
the device is neutralized.

1157
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,589
Good work.

1158
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,511
Fox Hunt is now terminated.

1159
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,238
No loose ends.

1160
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:40,719
Understood.

1161
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,714
It's Bromley.

1162
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,030
I need an AP out to all
city-district units

1163
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:57,680
from Wapping High Street
to the A1203.

1164
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:03,958
Suspect's an Asian male,
61 years of age, 5'8", 11 stone.

1165
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,076
His name's Ngoc Minh Quan.

1166
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,152
He's armed, and has
US Special Forces training.

1167
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:12,152
Use extreme caution.

1168
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,069
Yes.

1169
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,993
I was on the flight
they targeted to blow up.

1170
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,069
Because of your
timely information,

1171
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,235
we stopped it.

1172
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,833
I wanted to
thank you personally.

1173
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,429
Thank God you're okay.

1174
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,751
The bombers were neutralized,
even Sara McKay,

1175
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,628
whom you called, "Maggie".

1176
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,793
She gave a reporter the bomb

1177
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,394
that was to have been put
on my flight.

1178
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,789
She also carried out
the bus carnage,

1179
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:10,556
and is directly connected
to you, and McGrath.

1180
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,912
We have call-pens going to and from
her off the cell towers

1181
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,194
by your farm and town homes.

1182
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,192
That's 250 precision locations
and activations

1183
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:19,599
consistent with
your mutual activities.

1184
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:20,795
Katherine...

1185
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,029
I've spoken to the PM.

1186
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,076
He's agreed to keep you
in office for now.

1187
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,873
I'm issuing pardons for five On-the-Runs,
one is your cousin.

1188
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,875
But make no mistake, Deputy First Minister,
you are ours now.

1189
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,757
I say "jump,"
you say "where?"

1190
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,116
You're on the next flight
back to London.

1191
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:40,478
Tomorrow, you'll brief 8015
and myself on everything you know.

1192
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:41,913
All of it.

1193
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,951
Good evening, sir.

1194
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,599
How did you find me?

1195
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,114
I gave you the names,
like I said.

1196
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:29,230
This woman, she's a bomber.
You lie. You plan everything.

1197
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,592
For whatever it's worth,

1198
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:36,831
I never intended to
hurt your daughter.

1199
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,831
Or any of those people.

1200
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:43,153
Send.

1201
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,069
Do it!

1202
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,117
It's now on the Internet,
you and your mistress.

1203
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:09,274
The whole world will know
you are a terrorist.

1204
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:13,438
Goodbye, Mr. Hennessy.

1205
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,515
Yes?

1206
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,478
It's Landesman, sir, in S-11.
I've got him.

1207
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,629
Where?

1208
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:12,271
The Happy Peacock Takeaway.
He's returned. Do I send in a team?

1209
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,030
No.

1210
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,429
I believe we owe
this chap something.

1211
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:22,115
Keep back for now.
