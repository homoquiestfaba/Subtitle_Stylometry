Nope.

1148
00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:32,284
<i>His bum's
all full of heroin.
He doesn't mean that.</i>

1149
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:34,224
<i>No, no, no.
I'm a terrible drug addict.</i>

1150
00:56:34,493 --> 00:56:35,926
Mule!
No.

1151
00:56:36,027 --> 00:56:37,255
<i>He's a mule!
No.</i>

1152
00:56:37,362 --> 00:56:39,125
<i>You're the devil.
Perfect.</i>

1153
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:44,057
All right,
I want my package now.

1154
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:46,670
<i>I'm not gonna
give you the drugs</i>

1155
00:56:46,772 --> 00:56:48,831
<i>until we're in Los Angeles,
post-show.</i>

1156
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,205
<i>Just to clarify,
are you saying you're
withholding my narcotics?</i>

1157
00:56:52,644 --> 00:56:55,340
<i>You made a huge
tactical error
and now I'm in control.</i>

1158
00:56:55,614 --> 00:56:56,581
Okay.

1159
00:56:57,816 --> 00:56:59,181
Are you ticklish?
Okay, stop.

1160
00:56:59,284 --> 00:57:00,546
Okay, stop.
Give me the package.

1161
00:57:00,652 --> 00:57:02,415
Seriously stop!
Seriously stop!
Seriously stop!
