1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,271
(slow ominous music)

2
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,778
(loud thuds)

3
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,554
(ominous music)

4
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,040
- [Agent] We've just
received word from Vienna

5
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,809
that there has been an
explosion at the UN facility.

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,382
It occurred as the elite
European security team

7
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,619
led by Colonel Max Leo attempted
to rescue the hostages.

8
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,924
Terrorist leader Omodo
Kelal is believed

9
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,693
to have escaped
during the attack.

10
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,632
Casualties are
believed to be high

11
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,901
with Colonel Leo among
the critically injured.

12
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,173
(melancholy music)

13
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,302
- [Anchor] The
president is scheduled

14
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,737
to inaugurate the competition.

15
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,790
(light solemn music)

16
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,988
- [Anchor] Security
is tight in light of

17
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,691
fears of terrorist attempts
to disrupt the games.

18
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,059
The mayor has gone
on record as saying

19
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,561
"There'll be no Munich
here in Atlanta."

20
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,398
And security is
particularly tight as the

21
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,133
president and the
leaders of 20 nations

22
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,901
gather here to
commemorate the start of

23
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,070
the game with a summit appeal.

24
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,074
(ominous music)

25
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,516
(faint groaning)

26
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,926
- And you will proceed to
the security checkpoints

27
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,127
and get your clearance.

28
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,663
That's a little bad
just like this one.

29
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,666
And then you'll report to
your designated stations.

30
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,070
At all times, remember,

31
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,606
for the next 16 days
you are representing

32
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,708
the city of Atlanta

33
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,177
and the United States.

34
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,679
Now there are television
crews everywhere

35
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,815
so I don't want any problems.

36
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,651
The eyes of the entire
world are on us.

37
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,754
Courtesy and efficiency
ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,656
that's what it's all about.

39
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,024
Any questions?

40
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,125
- Exciting isn't it?

41
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,930
- Okay, if there's no
questions, let's get to work.

42
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,166
- You've got to be
excited about this Jack,

43
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,901
we get to watch the game!

44
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:09,869
- No we...

45
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,209
We get to clean the
game's toilets Bena.

46
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,444
It's not like we're
in the $1,000 seats.

47
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,612
- It's once in a lifetime Jack.

48
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,682
Even the President of the
United States is gonna be there.

49
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,183
My kids can't wait
to hear about it.

50
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,853
Maybe I get my picture
taken with someone famous!

51
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,787
- [Jack] No you
know you won't Bena.

52
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,955
- You don't fool me Jack.

53
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,223
I've seen the way you've
been hanging around

54
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,591
the swimming practices.

55
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,862
- Yeah well, my ex-wife is the

56
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,531
assistant coach
on the swim team.

57
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,732
- Wow, a games coach!

58
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,135
You've gotta be
excited about that!

59
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,035
- [Jack] Oh yeah.

60
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,938
- [Man In Blue] It's
just the keys sir.

61
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,844
- [Guard] Keys are the
only metal, he's clear.

62
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,584
(ominous music)

63
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,971
- I've located the explosives.

64
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,193
(suspenseful music)

65
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,179
(loud beeping)

66
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,852
(melancholy music)

67
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,893
(loud rumbling)

68
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,166
(ominous music)

69
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,279
- [Security] Janitorial
staff's arriving.

70
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,181
Be sure to scan
the driver's badge.

71
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,923
(ominous music)

72
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,659
- Where's your cane?

73
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,793
- [Jack] Oh I forgot it.

74
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,029
- This doesn't have
anything to do with

75
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,130
seeing your ex?

76
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,134
- Diane and I have been
apart for a long time.

77
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,936
I'm fine with that.

78
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,137
I don't wanna see her.

79
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,872
- She might be impressed that
you're getting it together

80
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,073
after prison and rehab.

81
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,076
- She's not the type to think

82
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,111
that a work furlough program
is getting it together.

83
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,982
- You two broke up
because she had a good job

84
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:43,883
and you didn't.

85
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,819
- You are nosy Bena.

86
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,287
- I'm a mother, so shoot me.

87
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,388
- Okay, open the door.

88
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,391
- Opening the door.

89
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,129
(loud buzzing)

90
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,714
(ominous music)

91
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,830
- Cheer up coach,
we'll kill 'em.

92
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,064
- [Coach] Yeah.

93
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,799
- You were sure
back at Barcelona.

94
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,168
Must be tough to be coaching

95
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,903
a bunch of prima
donnas instead huh?

96
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,977
- Thank you.

97
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,813
- Wow, sure is a
lot of security.

98
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,917
(ominous music)

99
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,497
- [Security] Swim team
coming through for practice.

100
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,899
- We were two totally
different people.

101
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,300
She was a champion I
was more interested

102
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,069
in what it took
to be a champion.

103
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,237
I wanted to own a gym,

104
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,438
she wanted her face
on a cereal box.

105
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,440
We didn't have a lot
of common you know?

106
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,475
- So that's it?

107
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,011
- Yeah.

108
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,348
After I hurt my leg
and loss of gold,

109
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,051
I pretty much self destructed.

110
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,855
Then we had even less in common.

111
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,424
- You ought to forget
about what she'll think

112
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,825
and go and say hi.

113
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,329
- I don't think so.

114
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,230
- Jack.

115
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,368
We all do the best
with what we've got.

116
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,437
If she's a smart
lady she'll see that.

117
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:46,906
I'll get this.

118
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,110
You're pretty good on one leg.

119
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,523
- Let's go.

120
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,891
Come on let's move.

121
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,228
Come on, we're gonna
have to hustle up.

122
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,229
We only have an
hour before the next

123
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,263
team gets the pool.

124
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,399
- Why do they bother?

125
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,000
We're sweeping.

126
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,103
- Not if you don't get
your butts in gear.

127
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,406
Here take mine.

128
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,413
(faint beeping)

129
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,285
- [Guard] IDs check out.

130
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,390
- Good luck coach.

131
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,325
- [Coach] Thanks guys.

132
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,193
- Opening the door.

133
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,166
(loud beeping)

134
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,274
(loud buzzing)

135
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,984
- Hey Moses, that news
crew is still inside.

136
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,386
Isn't that supposed to
be a closed practice?

137
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,621
No press.

138
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,589
- I'll send someone
to clear them out.

139
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,528
(ominous music)

140
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,171
- Sure wish I had tickets.

141
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,238
- Everyone else does.

142
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,975
- But I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to go in anyway my friend.

143
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,277
- Not without a ticket pal.

144
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:38,050
(loud hissing)
(ominous music)

145
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:52,898
- Moses.

146
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,172
Unlock the doors.

147
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,464
- 7:49.

148
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,365
7:48.

149
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,647
- Moses.

150
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,949
We're in, cut the
communications.

151
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,429
(faint beeping)

152
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,646
- Communications cut.

153
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,428
Clear.

154
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,429
6:17.

155
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,066
Practice pools all set.

156
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,417
(loud beeping)

157
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,187
- [Terrorist] Motion
triggers activated here.

158
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,256
Locking up.

159
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,758
(loud beeping)

160
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,762
- [Terrorist] It's
clear in here.

161
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,692
- [Male Coach] Hustle up,
we don't have much time.

162
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,127
- You're gonna go
into the first door

163
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,096
on your left up here.

164
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:37,763
You ready?

165
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:42,801
- Oh yeah.

166
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,844
- [Male Coach] You all right?

167
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,545
- Go on ahead Bill.

168
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,416
- [Bill] Is that...

169
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,686
- Yeah.

170
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,792
- You holler if you
need anything okay?

171
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,694
Jack.

172
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,809
(slow paced music)

173
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,710
- Hi.

174
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,213
- How's your leg?

175
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,550
- It's okay.

176
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,621
It's hell on my
ballroom dancing.

177
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,326
- I tried to find you later.

178
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,596
- I didn't want to be found.

179
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,770
- I guess I handled
things badly.

180
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,606
- Yeah well, you had
your career priorities

181
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,341
that you needed to take care of.

182
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,880
- You know we've had
this conversation before.

183
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,415
I've got to go.

184
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,883
- Oh well that's something
new and different.

185
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,588
- Would it have been so
difficult to support me

186
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,589
a little bit more?

187
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,724
- Oh come on Diane, you
didn't need my support.

188
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,294
Everybody supported
you, you had it all.

189
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,664
- You're wrong Jack.

190
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,577
- Try again.

191
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,712
And get that chip off
your shoulder next time.

192
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,283
- [Jack] Shit.

193
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,324
(slow paced music)

194
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,204
- Come on ladies, let's go.

195
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,376
(ominous music)

196
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,869
- Everything's
looking good Omodo.

197
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,691
Your boys on the construction
crew did the job.

198
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,371
Team CD and K have
completed rigging.

199
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,472
South side secure.

200
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,475
- Gather the police and staff.

201
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,814
- Hey boys and girls,
captain just showed.

202
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,684
He wants everyone to assemble
in meeting room A, pronto.

203
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,654
(ominous music)

204
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:56,355
(faint laughter)

205
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,558
- [Officer] So where do
you think the captain is?

206
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,860
There's nobody here.

207
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,762
- [Terrorist] Palms up.

208
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,434
On your knees, get down!

209
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,382
- [Moses] The upper levels
and roof have been rigged.

210
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,518
The practice pool is ready,
so is the TV news crew.

211
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,021
Everyone's moving
into their positions.

212
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,522
Just give us the go-ahead.

213
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,423
- Are we secure?

214
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,866
- All entrances and
exits have been sealed.

215
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,737
- And how is the rest
of the list going?

216
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,539
- [Moses] Just two
janitors to go.

217
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,408
They're the only
ones not on radio.

218
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:51,943
- Good.

219
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,817
(loud gunshot)

220
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,851
Excuse me gentlemen.

221
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,059
- [Terrorist] On your face.

222
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,063
Too slow!

223
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,765
(loud gunfire)

224
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,936
- [Moses] What about
the two janitors?

225
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,806
Do you want me to send
someone after them?

226
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,641
- That's not important for now.

227
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,051
Finish placing the explosives
and motion sensors.

228
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:36,955
Four minutes!

229
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,092
Move gentlemen!

230
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,827
Timing!

231
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,728
Timing!

232
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,466
(ominous music)

233
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,917
- [Diane] 20 minutes
left, let's go.

234
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,141
- [Bill] Frankly Liz,
I've done a superb job of

235
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,044
getting them to peek
at just the right time.

236
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,779
- Is the injury to Carol Taylor

237
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,648
serious enough to
consider having her

238
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,883
sit out the 100?

239
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,618
- We're not saving
her for the 200,

240
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,154
the 100 is her strongest
event she could be swimming.

241
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,658
Excuse me.

242
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,194
- Bill.

243
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,061
Bill.

244
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:23,995
- I'll be right back.

245
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,138
- Look, what are you jealous?

246
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,873
- I thought there was no press
at the practice sessions?

247
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,308
- They snuck in sweetie.

248
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,877
- It doesn't say a lot for
the security around here.

249
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,714
- Yeah well...

250
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,286
So how'd it go with your ex?

251
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,289
Look, this is our big day.

252
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,859
Don't let that loser
screw it up huh.

253
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,260
- He's not a loser.

254
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,195
- Yeah, that's why
he's a janitor now.

255
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,096
- Come on Bill.

256
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,565
- Sorry.

257
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,001
Look, he just pisses me off.

258
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,538
You know how I feel about you.

259
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,612
- Okay guys let's go.

260
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:15,981
Come on, let's get started.

261
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,791
Swimmers take your marks, we
don't have a lot of time here.

262
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,692
Let's go!

263
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,096
- Hubba-hubba.

264
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,597
- [Security] I love this job.

265
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,066
(light laughter)

266
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,836
(ominous music)

267
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,056
- So who's left
besides the swim team?

268
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,759
- Just two janitors.

269
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,128
The one you're
watching and a woman.

270
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,664
She's about to go into
one of the pool offices.

271
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,203
Guess who's running
intelligence here?

272
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:13,939
Leo.

273
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,808
Saw his name on
the new manifest.

274
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:20,812
Problem?

275
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,051
- No problem.

276
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,687
I'm just surprised he's alive.

277
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,022
Thought I blew him up.

278
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,928
- I heard what he did
your operation in Vienna.

279
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,963
- He's good.

280
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:39,965
60 seconds.

281
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,962
Leo sends his regards.

282
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,164
- [Terrorist] He
ruined it in Vienna.

283
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,767
- He's not the problem
little brother.

284
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,302
This time I finish him.

285
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:23,008
- We can talk or
we can practice.

286
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,798
Come on.

287
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,175
- Hey coach!

288
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,010
- Freeze!
(loud gunshots)

289
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,846
(loud screaming)

290
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,851
- Get this!

291
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,354
(loud gunshot)

292
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,526
- Hold still!
- Secure the swimmers!

293
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,427
- No!

294
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,501
- Leave her alone!
- Let's go, let's go!

295
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,470
- [Bill] Don't kill me!

296
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,110
- [Terrorist] Get
up, come on, get up!

297
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,445
(loud screaming)

298
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,146
Lock the perimeter!

299
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,081
- [Terrorist] Come
on, move ladies!

300
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,816
Over by your coach!

301
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,554
- [Terrorist] Bring the
swimmers here by the coach!

302
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,789
- [Terrorist] Move along!

303
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,358
(ominous music)

304
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,374
- [Terrorist] Secure!

305
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,320
- Are you okay?

306
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,532
(loud clanking)

307
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,515
- What the hell is going on?

308
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,518
- [Moses] FBI computer scans
will detect us in 30 seconds.

309
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,287
(ominous music)

310
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,874
(suspenseful music)

311
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,895
- [Anchor] The president
has arrived in Atlanta.

312
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,297
Plans are for a short.

313
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,232
- [Terrorist] Sir, you can
monitor the local news.

314
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,900
- [Anchor] City hall,
where he will be met

315
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,037
by Mayor Lewis and
20 world leaders.

316
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,973
From there, it's on to the
stadium for opening ceremonies.

317
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,409
- Are we set?

318
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,518
(loud beeping)

319
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,255
- Go.

320
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,192
- [Anchor] Security
has been heavy.

321
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,528
- [Terrorist] We're secure.

322
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,429
- It's time.

323
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,031
The alert should be going out.

324
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,038
(loud beeping)

325
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,041
- Code 72 we have a hot
situation at the Aquatic Center.

326
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,645
(ominous music)

327
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,397
- [Security] Get
this on the air now!

328
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,536
(faint sirens)

329
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,374
- We expect the president
over here in an hour.

330
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,143
We'll motorcade to the
games for the first event.

331
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,679
- Security is up and
tied around City Hall

332
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,281
and all along the venue.

333
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,516
- [Female] Good.

334
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,386
- You'd better see this mayor.

335
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,388
It's going out live
all over the world.

336
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,295
- Good morning your honor,

337
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,730
assembled guests, hello Leo.

338
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,401
We have taken over
the swimming complex

339
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,270
and are holding the American
women's swim team hostage.

340
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,373
We have rigged explosives
at all games venues.

341
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,075
I will not fail to
detonate these should

342
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,177
any action be taken against us.

343
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,179
- They're using their
own satellite link.

344
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,015
(faint sirens)

345
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,550
- [Agent] Contingency plans
show the swimming complex

346
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,453
is too large to take
without discovery in time.

347
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,755
Entrances have been compromised.

348
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,594
- We do this on behalf of
the oppressed everywhere

349
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,563
It is a protest against the
so-called peace gathering

350
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,132
of world leaders in your city.

351
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,100
- May I have the
floor plans please?

352
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,102
- [Omodo] The United
States and it's powers

353
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,204
have exactly 20
minutes to release all

354
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,006
political prisoners
within their prisons.

355
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,276
I will place on the
internet details

356
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,278
of exactly who is
to be released.

357
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,481
- Oh, it's an old friend.

358
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,751
We meet again.

359
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,188
- For every five minutes
beyond the deadline,

360
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,757
I will make an aspiring
young swimmer world famous.

361
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,126
(loud beeping)

362
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,494
- The website link
is www.comefreedom.

363
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,765
Remember, explosives
are being installed

364
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,168
at 47 locations throughout
the game's venues.

365
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,503
Do not force me to
(speaks softly).

366
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,206
Stay tuned.

367
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,243
- The FBI agent in charge
is on his way here.

368
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,645
Tactical teams being deployed.

369
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,160
- Do as you're told ladies.

370
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,431
No excuses, no second chances.

371
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,508
- [Anchor] That was a live
feed from the practice

372
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,510
pool in the games
aquatic center.

373
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,346
We have no information on
who these terrorists are

374
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,681
or if there have
been any casualties.

375
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,151
However, the mention
of hostages brings back

376
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,619
the terrible memories of Munich.

377
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:18,256
- What I mean is get
'em now, that's right!

378
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,825
(ominous music)

379
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,300
- Looks can be deceiving.

380
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,369
- I know you Interpol guys
do things differently,

381
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,203
but...

382
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,204
- You think Leo's nuts?

383
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,739
- Yeah, the guy's creepy.

384
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,474
- Well he's always
being a little strange.

385
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,543
And after Omodo got
through with him in Vienna,

386
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,677
he got a lot stranger.

387
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,212
But so would you
if you got blown up

388
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,413
and lost half your life.

389
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,250
Everyone deals with
pain differently.

390
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:47,885
Leo's found his.

391
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,354
- Can he still be effective?

392
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,324
- Like the terrorists,
he is obsessed

393
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,625
to the point of insanity.

394
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,495
That makes them effective.

395
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,466
(ominous music)

396
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,208
- [Officer] Activate the
manual gate override.

397
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,184
- [Moses] FBI recon
teams are here.

398
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,220
- Here we go.

399
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,289
- Once more brother.

400
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,859
(ominous music)

401
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,562
(suspenseful music)

402
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,631
- [Agent] Freeze, FBI!

403
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,636
- Omodo Kelal is a pseudonym.
We don't know his real name

404
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:39,837
or anything about
his background.

405
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,473
However, this Kelal,
he's committed numerous

406
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,976
large-scale operations
over the last six years.

407
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,777
Until last year Kelal
was considered the

408
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,313
most skillful
terrorist in the world.

409
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,315
- What happened last year?

410
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,217
- Two operations
ended in failure.

411
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,253
- So he can be stopped.

412
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,321
- By failure I meant
his operation did not

413
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,690
accomplish his announced goals.

414
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,993
But there were many casualties.

415
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,694
Particularly last
year in Vienna.

416
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,829
- And obviously he got away.

417
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,000
- His credibility in the
terrorist network has fallen.

418
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,735
He's considered too
reckless and dangerous

419
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,670
by many of those organizations.

420
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:16,240
Kelal is looking to reestablish
himself here in atlanta.

421
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,742
(suspenseful music)

422
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:18,676
- [Agent] Thermal
scan shows the whole

423
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,845
building is rigged
with motion triggers.

424
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,983
If anything touches that
glass it all goes up.

425
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,324
(ominous music)

426
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,030
(fast paced music)

427
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:43,301
- [Bena] Hello,
hello, hello, hello?!

428
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,436
- Got one of the
janitors, a black female

429
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,971
in hallway C11.

430
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,406
She knows about us.

431
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,742
- [Agent] In here!

432
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:53,678
Get her, go!

433
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,417
(loud gunshots)

434
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,302
- [Terrorist] Open the door!

435
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,947
(loud gunshot)

436
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,720
(loud gunshots)

437
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,999
(loud gunshots)

438
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,474
- Jack!

439
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,043
(loud gunshots)

440
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,800
- No camera in the locker room.

441
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,513
(fast paced music)

442
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,098
- [Terrorist] We've got
an open ceiling panel.

443
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,399
Looks like he went up.

444
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,437
(suspenseful music)

445
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,713
We're going up, check
that room next to you.

446
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,714
- [Terrorist] Got it.

447
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:20,391
(faint gunshot)
(loud screaming)

448
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,031
(loud thud)

449
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,432
- We lost contact with
Jules and Ernesto.

450
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,703
We're missing someone, but
this guy isn't a janitor.

451
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:13,077
(fast paced music)

452
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,159
- How are you planning
to get out Omodo?

453
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,762
- The FBI's patching into
the agent in-command.

454
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,639
- Where's the janitor?

455
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,009
- [Moses] Exiting the
women's locker room.

456
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:45,910
And he's armed.

457
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,112
- Find him.

458
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,120
(ominous music)

459
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,008
- [Anchor] Aquatic center.

460
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,812
We hope to have a list
of those trapped inside.

461
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,148
- Let's go.

462
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,722
- What are they doing?

463
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,760
(loud screaming)

464
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,968
- Don't touch her!
- Come on, let's go!

465
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,971
- [Terrorist] Sit down!

466
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,840
(loud screaming)

467
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,640
- If you don't mind I'd
like to use your EOC.

468
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,175
I'd like to listen to a
consultant we're working with.

469
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,312
- [Anchor] We are
getting another live feed

470
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,614
from the terrorists
in the pool complex.

471
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,985
(ominous music)

472
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,788
- You're 20 minutes have passed.

473
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,357
(faint sobbing)

474
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,971
(loud gunshot)

475
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,008
(faint sobbing)

476
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,114
(loud ringing)

477
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:13,390
- Don't look.

478
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,325
Don't look.

479
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,396
- You have no time for strategy.

480
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,934
Our next showgirl will
be on in five minutes.

481
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,270
I'm getting bored.

482
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,407
I think I'm going to
detonate one of my bombs.

483
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,010
I warned you.

484
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,346
- Bombs at every venue.

485
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,783
Is that possible?

486
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,752
- Omodo is known for the
honesty of his threats.

487
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,320
He does exactly what he says.
- Mr. Schue.

488
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,422
Well can we disarm the bombs?

489
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,191
- With the timeline so tight,

490
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,426
we don't have the
resources to find them all.

491
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,095
- [Agent] I recommend we pay up

492
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,463
and deal with the terrorists

493
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,798
after the hostages
have been released.

494
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,867
- [Shue] The policy is no deals.

495
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,268
- [Agent] Look, there's
still a good chance

496
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,838
negotiations will free the
hostages to end this thing.

497
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,941
- Gentlemen, this man has

498
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,945
no intentions to let anyone go.

499
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,213
It's not his style.

500
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,347
- Who's that?

501
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,882
- Mr. Leo.

502
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,752
Town and terrorist
expert friend Interpol.

503
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,254
- What do you mean it's
not his style Mr. Leo?

504
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:20,090
- He blows up his hostages
to cover his escape.

505
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:23,360
He did it in Cairo in
85, in Paris in 90,

506
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,929
and last year in Vienna.

507
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,833
There is not much
chance of saving anyone.

508
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,735
- But if he always
kills his hostages

509
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,003
nobody would deal with him.

510
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,838
Now what kind of
strategy is that?

511
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,507
- [Leo] It's been
very effective.

512
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,843
- I don't care what
he's done in the past.

513
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,311
Now this is America,

514
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,214
we have to do everything
we can to save lives.

515
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,116
- He knows how you think.

516
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,885
He's counting on it.

517
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,153
- Your recommendation Leo?

518
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:53,123
- There is no justice for all.

519
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:57,528
You have to sacrifice a
few innocent civilians

520
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:58,996
and kill him.

521
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,164
- Shue.

522
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,099
- [Leo] It'll save
a lot of bloodshed.

523
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,034
- Hold on Leo.

524
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,137
- The American people
will never tolerate it.

525
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,005
- I know.

526
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,774
We'll continue to try
to get them out alive,

527
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,010
but Leo's the best at his job.

528
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,144
Let him do it his way.

529
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,386
Give us your analysis Leo.

530
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,956
- Right now this is a diversion.

531
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,324
He's after something else.

532
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,293
- [Mayor] A diversion?

533
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,427
For what Mr. Leo?

534
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,097
- I don't know yet.

535
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,536
(loud beeping)

536
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,509
- Shit.

537
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:48,512
(loud explosion)

538
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,047
- God damn it!

539
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,815
- What the hell was that?

540
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,318
(loud ringing)

541
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,889
- The stadium's been blown up.

542
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,424
- Is this CT 600?

543
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,427
- It's a fission boost.

544
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,396
- You know what he's doing?

545
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,866
He's pushing the
buttons of Atlanta.

546
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,935
- What about the options?

547
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,103
The negotiations.

548
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,872
- He's cut all lines
of communication.

549
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,273
- [Mayor] Have the
assault teams try to

550
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,075
rescue the swimmers.

551
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,844
- His hostages
were never rescued.

552
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,346
They died.

553
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,481
We should concentrate
on all his moves

554
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,584
and then when we can
go in for the kill.

555
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,088
- [Agent] What about
the rest of the venues?

556
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,290
- The games are over.

557
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,191
Evacuate.

558
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,961
- I'm moving every officer.

559
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,062
I'm going downtown

560
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:40,998
to look for bombs.

561
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,134
- What about the
president's security?

562
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,402
Is he still coming here?

563
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,341
- The president refuses
to be scared off.

564
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,143
He intends to show.

565
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,578
Show support for the hostages.

566
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:00,984
- Everybody knows this
is an election year.

567
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:06,089
(ominous music)

568
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,498
(faint beeping)

569
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,008
- [Anchor] The president,
aware of the potential

570
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,910
threat against him has decided

571
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,545
along with the 20 world
leaders to continue

572
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,248
on to city hall where
he will personally

573
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,550
take charge of the
rescue operation.

574
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,553
In a statement at the airport,
the president emphasized.

575
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,194
- [Jack] Shit.

576
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,140
- [Moses] Bomb squads here.

577
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,944
- Two minutes before
they cut power.

578
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,012
Where is the janitor?

579
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,350
(ominous music)

580
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,121
(fast paced music)

581
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,603
- Ground level offices on
the east side of the pool.

582
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,606
(fast paced music)

583
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,664
(faint beeping)

584
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,374
(ominous music)

585
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,047
(loud alarm)

586
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,114
- [Anchor] This is what
we know at the moment.

587
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,183
- [Terrorist] What's that?

588
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,086
- [Anchor] Has been
taken over by an unknown

589
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,654
number of terrorists.

590
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,722
The leader of these.

591
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,757
- [Terrorist] Over here!

592
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,494
It's alright, I got your back.

593
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,430
- [Terrorist] Over
here, over here!

594
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,597
- Shut it off!

595
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:34,037
- [Anchor] Kelal which
translated means dragon fire.

596
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,407
Kelal is known to be responsible
for at least five other.

597
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,609
- Fire alarm will set
off in aquatic center.

598
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,713
- That could mean there's
someone running around free.

599
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:43,613
- Yeah.

600
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:53,123
- [Agent] Casualties at
level 10, I repeat, level 10.

601
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,659
- Get me information on
whoever was in the building.

602
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,661
Like cleaning people, anybody.

603
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,598
(suspenseful music)

604
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,368
(loud gunshots)

605
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,179
- Motion triggers set
up in a broad perimeter

606
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,714
at all entrances and windows.

607
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,585
We can't get to the
target until neutralized.

608
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,322
Confirmed.

609
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,257
Triggers are tied
into the power grid.

610
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,460
- Prepare to cut power.

611
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,066
(suspenseful music)

612
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,084
- Moses, open the door!

613
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:04,461
(loud gunshot)

614
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,770
- [Terrorist] I
think we hit him!

615
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,824
- He's headed for the basement.

616
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,167
He's out of camera range.

617
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,270
He must have gone
into the basement.

618
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,740
- Stop him before he
reaches the power unit.

619
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,743
- [Terrorist] Go
around the other way.

620
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,512
- [Terrorist] Got it!

621
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,151
- This way.

622
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,590
(loud grunting)

623
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,309
(faint beeping)

624
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,815
- [Agent] All teams proceed
to disarm explosives.

625
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:38,889
- Get to your positions.

626
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,399
- Power cut is imminent.

627
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:50,600
- Ready here.

628
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,302
- Do it.

629
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,404
- Cut the power.
- They're doing it.

630
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:55,906
- Alright.

631
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,008
Yeah, that's gonna work.

632
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,576
- [Agent] Seven, six,

633
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:00,577
five, four,

634
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,514
three, two, one, cutting power.

635
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,350
- [Anchor] Other than
there are believed

636
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,985
to be hostages under
Kalels control.

637
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:15,492
(loud clank)
(low rumbling)

638
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,328
Practice pool complex has
been rigged with bombs.

639
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,496
- How's the power unit?

640
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,401
- [Moses] Power
unit still online.

641
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,639
- Shit!

642
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:34,811
They still have power.

643
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,780
- [Agent] Alright,
all teams back off.

644
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,850
- I wonder what this is.

645
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,021
Basement.

646
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,330
(ominous music)

647
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,071
- Oh, shit.

648
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,673
- [Moses] Got him, he's
in the basement causeway.

649
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:07,043
Lost him.

650
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,916
I've got blind spots
in the base below,

651
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,417
limited camera positions.

652
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,606
I can't see him,
he's out of range.

653
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,508
You're on your own.

654
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,484
(faint clanking)

655
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,496
I'm scanning the basement,

656
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,631
but he's not showing up.

657
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:12,609
Checking the pipe rims.

658
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:14,844
I just don't see him.

659
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,780
- You sure he's in there?

660
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,349
- [Moses] There's only one
way in and he didn't use it.

661
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,855
- I lost him, help me Moses.

662
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:26,823
- [Moses] Karl's come
in the other way.

663
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:27,791
Use the door on your left,

664
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,592
you can circle around
through the rear rooms.

665
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,461
It'll take you back
to the entrance.

666
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,101
(ominous music)

667
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:55,819
Stop.

668
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,723
He's on the other
side of the door.

669
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,091
Use the entrance to your right.

670
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,026
You can circle
around behind him.

671
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,076
(faint clicking)

672
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,177
- [Terrorist] Turn around.

673
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,545
Slowly.

674
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,648
Who are you my friend?

675
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:26,549
FBI?

676
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,420
(loud grunting)

677
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:43,900
Come on, get up.

678
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,703
Let's see how this feels!

679
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,543
You're not FBI.

680
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,112
(loud grunting)

681
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,785
(loud gunshot)

682
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:40,824
(loud grunting)
(ominous music)

683
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,059
- Christ.

684
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:18,895
He got Karl Micheal.

685
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:36,079
He knows we're watching him.

686
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,680
He's got one of our headset.

687
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,283
Communications are compromised.

688
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,818
- Are you sure Karl is dead?

689
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,588
- [Moses] Affirmative, a
knife got him in the throat.

690
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,762
The janitors good.

691
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:54,931
- Access the personnel files.

692
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,833
Let's find out who
this fucker is.

693
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,834
- Give me a minute.

694
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,382
- [Anchor] From here
it looks like the

695
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,952
FBI assault teams are
about to make a move.

696
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:52,388
Combat aerial units have
arrived above the pool complex.

697
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,223
- Okay, the FBI's
gonna take them.

698
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,894
Alright, when they
do, be ready to run.

699
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:00,163
Use the fire exit.

700
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,266
There's gonna be
a lot of shooting,

701
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,902
so just keep going
okay, understood?

702
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,639
So just stay focused,
we can get through this.

703
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,277
Now one at a time,
move poolside.

704
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,912
Slowly okay?

705
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,281
Slowly.

706
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:23,319
It's okay.

707
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:53,816
- [Anchor] We've gotten
reports of a lot of

708
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,086
movement in the downtown
area around City Hall.

709
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,956
Security units are being
removed and redeployed

710
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,791
to the various
competition venues

711
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,193
which are spread
throughout the county.

712
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:06,896
Additional military units
are converging on sites

713
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:10,199
that are located in the
state's outlying regions.

714
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:13,102
The authorities have
given us no explanation.

715
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,804
However, with the
bombing of the stadium.

716
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,372
- I can help you
with the janitor.

717
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,844
His name is Jack Bryant.

718
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,413
I know who he is,
I can catch him.

719
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,986
- And what do you
want in return?

720
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,339
- You can let me go.

721
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,240
- Sorry?

722
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,910
- Let me go.

723
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:56,512
- And the rest of your team?

724
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,950
- I can't do much
for them in here.

725
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,321
I'll talk to the FBI
for you if you want.

726
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:07,857
- Is he FBI?

727
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,792
- No, he's a janitor.

728
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,762
I mean he used to used to
be an athlete or something.

729
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,431
Taekwondo or something.

730
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,401
I don't know.

731
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,536
So do we have a deal?

732
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,074
- We have a deal.

733
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,357
- Diane over there,
that's his wife.

734
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,361
They're separated, but
he'll come for her.

735
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:50,933
- Nik.

736
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,303
Bring me the coach.

737
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:04,213
(ominous music)

738
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,221
- Now listen to me,

739
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,323
I'm gonna create a
diversion now alright?

740
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:19,362
- [Nik] Let's go.

741
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,031
- Be ready.

742
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:24,600
(faint sobbing)

743
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,091
You son of a bitch.

744
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,260
- Yes.

745
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,362
- So can I go?

746
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,967
- That was the deal, Bill.

747
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,038
Go.

748
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:13,983
- Bill.

749
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,091
No!

750
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:27,029
(loud gunshot)
(loud screaming)

751
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:30,967
- Exciting isn't it?

752
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,272
- Okay, keep me
just let them go.

753
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,376
- You're not good television.

754
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,220
(loud buzzing)

755
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,154
- Files are coded.

756
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,257
Do you want me to keep trying?

757
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,092
- Forget about the files.

758
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,261
Just initiate the
escape protocol.

759
01:04:58,294 --> 01:04:59,161
- Copy.

760
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,532
Shit, I lost him.

761
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,310
Son of a bitch knows
where the cameras are.

762
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,103
(loud thud)

763
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:28,451
- Hey asshole.

764
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:39,795
It's over.

765
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:59,048
- Say hello to your wife Jack.

766
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,692
(loud scream)

767
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:14,697
The doors are locked.

768
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,133
They've been rigged with bombs,

769
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,000
there's no way out.

770
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,305
- What makes you
think I want to leave.

771
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,146
I'm coming for you.

772
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,580
- No.

773
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:32,581
Jack!

774
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:33,482
- Jack!

775
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:35,785
- Stop it!

776
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,387
- I'm busy right now Jack.

777
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:40,723
Take your time.

778
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:45,461
(loud gunshot)

779
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,682
(loud gunshots)

780
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:19,495
- Mr. White,

781
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:25,201
go to the security room
and kill that bastard.

782
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,135
- No, please wait!

783
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,777
- Bring me another.

784
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,429
- [Nik] Move, come on!

785
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:55,631
Let's go!

786
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:56,799
Out of my way!

787
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:02,872
On your feet.

788
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:05,674
Let's go!

789
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:47,550
- It's okay.

790
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,418
It's okay.

791
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,656
(loud sobbing)

792
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:02,598
(fast paced music)

793
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:19,048
- Faster my dear,
you're almost there!

794
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,784
(loud gunshots)

795
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,665
(faint ringing)

796
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:53,315
(loud ringing)

797
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:25,981
- Yeah.
- Sarah?

798
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,683
- Sarah's in deep shit.
- Hey!

799
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,054
(loud ringing)

800
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,623
- Listen, this is Jack Bryant.

801
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,125
I'm at the game's
Aquatic Center.

802
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,526
Terrorists have...

803
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,630
Well then why the
hell haven't you

804
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,432
people done something about it?!

805
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:52,708
- There's a janitor calling
out on a cellular phone.

806
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,043
They're gonna patch him through.

807
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:57,946
- Who is this?

808
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,014
- This is the mayor.

809
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,684
- The mayor?!

810
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,019
Look, I need the police
or the FBI or something.

811
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:06,689
- Police, FBI, we're all
here, tell us what you can.

812
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:07,856
- How many are there?

813
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,726
- I don't know.

814
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,628
But they've got
explosives on the doors.

815
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:13,996
- Listen, we cut the power,

816
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,631
but our sensors show
they have some other

817
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,766
power supply, have you seen
something that could be it?

818
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,967
- Put me into this call.

819
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:20,936
- [Jack] Maybe in the basement

820
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:22,538
there's some kind of power unit.

821
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,807
- [Shue] If you cut it,
we could defuse the bombs.

822
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:26,575
- [Jack] All right.

823
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:27,476
- Jack.

824
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,878
- Who's this?

825
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,581
- This is Leo, I need your help.

826
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,720
You need to look
around in the basement

827
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:40,923
for anything that could
be an escape route.

828
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,057
Anything.

829
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,193
Air ducts, sewer--

830
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,095
- Forget it. There's no way
I can get these hostages

831
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,863
out of here by myself.

832
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:49,732
- Jack, this is not your escape,

833
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,033
it's for the terrorists.

834
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:54,503
- Well that's great Leo,

835
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,905
but how are we gonna
get out of here?

836
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:00,109
- Like the FBI said,
they'll take care of you.

837
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,009
I promise.

838
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,580
Now save your batteries

839
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:07,015
and don't forget to call 9-1-1

840
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,417
when you find something.

841
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,825
- Christ, to depend
on a damn janitor.

842
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,996
- We don't have much
of a choice do we?

843
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,699
(loud ringing)

844
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,469
- There's a chance we can
get the power shut off.

845
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,638
- [PA System] This is
a priority one alert.

846
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,540
All non-essential
security units in the

847
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,709
downtown and city hall
quadrant will report

848
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,677
to the games complex
for redeployment.

849
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,481
- We could do much
worse than Mr. Bryant.

850
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:40,983
- [Agent] Security
downtown will be assumed

851
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:43,819
by the secret service
and will be controlled

852
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:44,720
and will be overlapped.

853
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,791
Security units 881
and 897 proceed

854
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:51,193
to checkpoint Alpha five nine.

855
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:52,694
- The president.

856
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:58,700
Damn!

857
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,906
(faint sobbing)

858
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:31,233
- The trouble we terrorists
always have with Americans

859
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:33,502
is you're too damn heroic.

860
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,806
But as you Americans
also like to say,

861
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,608
there are many
ways to skin a cat.

862
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,645
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

863
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,716
- Somebody do something.

864
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:49,318
- We've run out of time.

865
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:52,321
- Since you have no
regard for these hostages,

866
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:55,157
I am forced to raise the stakes.

867
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,760
If I do not get confirmation
of my demands in three minutes

868
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,997
I will begin detonating
the rest of the bombs.

869
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,732
- The president has
ordered the demands be met.

870
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,100
- [Omodo] There is
enough explosive there

871
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,602
to take out the
- Christ.

872
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:07,803
- [Omodo] 10 mile square area.

873
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,705
As I'm sure you
already confirmed.

874
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:13,242
We are prepared to die.

875
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,879
(loud beeping)

876
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,583
- [Terrorist] They've
agreed to all your terms,

877
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,652
transfers are confirmed,
congratulations.

878
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,957
- I thank you for
your cooperation.

879
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:32,060
Shortly I will inform you of
my demands for safe passage.

880
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,900
(faint sirens)

881
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,777
- [Terrorist] Should I
open the escape protocol?

882
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,645
- Do it.

883
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:52,714
- [Man At Gate] Copy that.

884
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,049
Coming in through the vent.

885
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:55,951
- 10 minutes.

886
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,289
(ominous music)

887
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,095
- [Terrorist] Sit down!

888
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,312
- He's not here.

889
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,620
I'll reboot the system.

890
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:56,712
- [Agent] Keep
going, keep going.

891
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:59,014
(loud beep)

892
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,986
- It's hopeless unless we
get that power turned off.

893
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,021
- [Anchor] The president
has arrived at City Hall

894
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,990
where he will confer
with the mayor,

895
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:10,192
games officials, and
the 20 world leaders.

896
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,060
But time is running out.

897
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:15,130
Will Atlanta burn again?

898
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:28,443
(loud gunshot)

899
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:38,954
- Shit.

900
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,724
I'm going for the basement.

901
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,761
(suspenseful music)

902
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:48,397
- Power's cut.

903
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,798
Motion detector are down.

904
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,400
Repeat, motion
detectors are down.

905
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:54,136
- Son of a bitch did it.

906
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,471
We're attempting to disarm
every bomb we've located.

907
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,873
We just need time now.

908
01:17:57,906 --> 01:17:58,774
- Great.

909
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,180
- [Leo] The vent.

910
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:25,801
- He messed up your
plans didn't he?

911
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:29,271
Go ahead, go ahead!

912
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:30,806
- My dear, such bravery.

913
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:32,407
- Fuck you.

914
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:36,044
(ominous music)

915
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,448
- [Agent] Go, move,
move, move, move!

916
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,348
Come on!

917
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,189
(loud crash)

918
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,294
(ominous music)

919
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,391
(faint beeping)

920
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:28,530
- Leo, I can't find it.

921
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:33,101
- Near the center of
the basement there's
a drainage vent.

922
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:34,503
You see it?

923
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:37,305
- Oh come on, give
me something more.

924
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:39,875
- Right next to it there's
a large pumping unit.

925
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,010
You can't miss it.

926
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,052
- Okay, I got it.

927
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:52,587
There's a grate over it.

928
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,923
It's locked but it looks
like it's been brushed off.

929
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,358
- Is it big enough for a man?

930
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:58,860
- Yeah.

931
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,996
- Jack, he'll be coming soon.

932
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,865
Is there any way you can keep
him busy for like 10 minutes?

933
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:05,033
We're sending in a team.

934
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,140
- And how I supposed
to keep them busy?

935
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:13,575
- Think of something.

936
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:15,110
You're a resourceful fellow.

937
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,614
- You got the wrong
guy for the job.

938
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:21,917
- I don't think so.

939
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,154
- If you know me you
wouldn't feel that way.

940
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:29,591
- I know you had some
tough breaks Jack.

941
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:32,561
I know you felt sorry for
yourself for quite a while.

942
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,896
Now's the time to think
about other people.

943
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,302
- Okay, it's your party I hope
you know what you're doing.

944
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:41,970
- Anyway, this is
your only chance

945
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,305
to save the life of a president.

946
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,674
How 'bout that?

947
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,209
- Yeah well that's good Leo,

948
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,010
'cause I'm all you got.

949
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,615
- You're not such a
bad guy after all.

950
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:54,583
- Yeah sure.

951
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,501
- [Agent] Another eight minutes.

952
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:18,206
- Insert that peephole.

953
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:28,283
(ominous music)

954
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,986
(loud gunfire)

955
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:38,593
- [Terrorist] Secure
the escape route.

956
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:43,331
- [Hostage] Come on, let's go.

957
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,438
- Ready, go, go, go!

958
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:59,214
(loud gunfire)

959
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:08,657
Go!

960
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:19,401
(heavy breathing)

961
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,003
- Kill her?

962
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:24,039
- Arm the explosives to
detonate in five minutes.

963
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,249
We're done here,
are you in position?

964
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:36,551
- Almost there.

965
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,454
The police have cleared out.

966
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,156
There's no security around.

967
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,090
- Five minutes.

968
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:44,025
- Affirmative.

969
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,100
- [Agent] Price, the
bombs have gone hot.

970
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,169
I repeat, the bombs are hot.

971
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:55,437
- [Terrorist] Bombs
are counting down.

972
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,538
- 3:40, get the vest.

973
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,181
- Go ahead, do it.

974
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,634
- We're moving to
protect the escape route.

975
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:32,107
(ominous music)

976
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:39,314
Shit, he's at the basement!

977
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:42,384
Let's go.

978
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:53,561
- [Agent] We'll be at the
van entrance in 30 seconds.

979
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,598
(suspenseful music)

980
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:05,640
- You're all set.

981
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,713
- Any more horsepower
in this unit?

982
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:15,683
(faint beeping)

983
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:18,119
- Stop!

984
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,488
Get away from the door, it's
booby trapped with explosives!

985
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:21,489
- Get us out of here!

986
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:22,424
They're coming!

987
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:23,391
- We're working on it.

988
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:24,659
Where are the terrorists now?

989
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,494
- We don't know, they've
got Coach Colton.

990
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:28,129
- Just relax, everything's
gonna be okay.

991
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:29,330
Just relax all right.

992
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:30,298
It's gonna be fine.

993
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:32,500
Some of the hostages are free

994
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:34,269
but we can't get to them.

995
01:24:34,302 --> 01:24:36,671
Another four minutes we'll
be able to get inside.

996
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,742
(suspenseful music)

997
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:44,879
(loud gunfire)

998
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,347
- Some of the hostages
have been freed

999
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,816
but we can't get them
out of the building yet.

1000
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,184
We need four minutes.

1001
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:51,352
- Ma'am.

1002
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:55,156
The president's in
the conference room.

1003
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,825
He wants a full briefing.

1004
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:59,861
(suspenseful music)

1005
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,768
- I'm coming down Jack!

1006
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,627
Show yourself.

1007
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:09,731
- You've got three
minutes before it goes.

1008
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:11,399
- Counting to five.

1009
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,668
One.

1010
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:17,672
Two.

1011
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:20,975
Three.

1012
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:24,646
Four.

1013
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:25,513
- No Jack!

1014
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:26,414
- Five!

1015
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:38,226
- Atlanta and the president
are going to be very surprised.

1016
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:44,866
The president, 20 world
leaders, the games,

1017
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,703
seems we're in the bonus
situations Mrs. Bryant.

1018
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:53,374
(suspenseful music)

1019
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,648
- You've got two
seconds, that's all.

1020
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:05,687
We're headed for the vent.

1021
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,423
- [Agent] Team Delta going
in the vent entrance.

1022
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:11,459
(suspenseful music)

1023
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,003
- If the FBI disarms
the bomb's upstairs,

1024
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:25,340
you're the back up Mrs. Bryant.

1025
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,577
How very sweet.

1026
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:32,547
(suspenseful music)

1027
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:39,621
- [Agent] Seven.

1028
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:40,521
Six.

1029
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:42,890
Five.

1030
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,325
- [Agent] Cutting
the first wire.

1031
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:46,527
- [Omodo] Activate the base.

1032
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,766
- One push of the
button and off you go.

1033
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:55,536
She's all set.

1034
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:02,110
(fast paced music)

1035
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:08,983
- [Terrorist] Package is in
position, we have confirmation.

1036
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,084
Target is in the building.

1037
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:10,985
- Excellent.

1038
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,880
(faint clicking)

1039
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:45,953
(fast paced music)

1040
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:50,091
Adios Mr. President.

1041
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:53,594
- I got a bad double pot.

1042
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:57,765
(loud beeping)

1043
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:06,441
(loud gunfire)

1044
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:11,512

1045
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:14,015
(loud gunfire)

1046
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:22,957
(loud grunt)

1047
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,193
- [Terrorist] Get out of
here Omodo, I'll go in!

1048
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:27,695
(loud thud)

1049
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:32,166

01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:12,994
FBI, stop!

1083
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,095
On your side.

1084
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:18,065
(fast paced music)

1085
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,277
(loud grunt)

1086
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,767
(loud beeping)

1087
01:32:57,838 --> 01:32:59,307
- Get in the water!

1088
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:08,182
(loud explosion)

1089
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,336
- Oh great.

1090
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:31,439
Your wife's okay.

1091
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:32,340
You okay?

1092
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:36,711
Pick up the detonator, come on!

1093
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:37,411
Let's go!

1094
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:43,351
- So you're a coach?

1095
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:46,053
- Yeah.

1096
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:48,189
- I used to be a
pretty good swimmer.

1097
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:49,056
- Yeah?

1098
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:49,991
- Yeah.

1099
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:51,158
- [Agent] This is the FBI.

1100
01:33:51,192 --> 01:33:52,927
Everyone in the rural area

1101
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,097
needs to move into
the clear immediately.

1102
01:33:56,130 --> 01:34:00,034
- He did pretty good,
your husband, didn't he?

1103
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:01,202
- Yeah he did.

1104
01:34:02,336 --> 01:34:05,239
(slow paced music)

1105
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:50,017
(dramatic music)

1106
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:00,394
- Should we try again?

1107
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:12,139
- Hey.

1108
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:15,910
I'm gonna need some
fins pretty soon.

1109
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:36,063
(suspenseful music)

1110
01:36:57,678 --> 01:37:01,215
(fast suspenseful music)

1111
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:18,592
(suspenseful music)

1112
01:38:33,407 --> 01:38:35,976
(loud thuds)
