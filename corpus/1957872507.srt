00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:04,033
(no audio)

2
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,333
(light music)

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,800
(light music)

4
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,166
(light music)

5
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,900
(light music)

6
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:53,333
(light music)

7
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,633
(light music)

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,400
(light music)

9
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,733
(light music)

10
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,233
(light music)

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,533
(birds chirping)

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,466
- [Renfroe] It's been said that you can never go home again.

13
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,900
I know that as a young boy growing up on a farm

14
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:00,633
in rural Louisiana was the greatest experience of my life.

15
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,100
So I decided to make one more trip

16
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:07,466
to see the old home place and remember the smell

17
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,933
of Mama's wood stove cooking cornbread and peas.

18
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,133
- How long has it been since you been here?

19
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,800
- Quite awhile.

20
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,266
(light music)

21
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,433
- [Renfroe] The days were long, but we didn't care

22
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,433
because of the fun we had as kids,

23
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:39,033
fishing and making kites out of old newspapers.

24
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,466
Sometime, D.J., my older brother,

25
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,766
would let me actually try to fly one of them.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,833
(harmonica music)

27
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,966
Nutty, a young neighbor boy living with his grandparents

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,900
was the best kite flier I think I ever saw.

29
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:06,200
He and D.J. were always trying to scare me with stories

30
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:09,300
about an old panther at night.

31
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,033
(Renfroe laughs)

32
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,933
"Screaming like a woman," they'd say.

33
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,300
I remember a special year in my life

34
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,866
that changed me forever.

35
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,333
To this day, I think about that time

36
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:28,933
when I would sit around and daydream of snow on Christmas.

37
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:34,166
Clara Mae made a new angel for our Christmas tree that year

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,266
and I got to keep the old one.

39
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,466
I took it and nailed it up on the front of the barn

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,366
and every time I walked by her,

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,133
she seemed to be watching my every move,

42
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,933
regardless of where I was standing.

43
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,200
Now even as a grown man,

44
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:58,433
I still believe in angels and miracles.

45
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,833
It seems like only yesterday

46
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,533
when Papa was ringing that old dinner bell

47
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:08,766
and we'd all come running from the fields.

48
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,766
(upbeat music)

49
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,833
(upbeat music)

50
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,000
(upbeat music)

51
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:34,266
- Renfroe, you boys need to wash up for supper.

52
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,233
- Nutty always gets the fly the kite.

53
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:41,233
- Well, there's far more practicing to do, Renfroe.

54
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,233
I'll teach you how to do it tomorrow.

55
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,066
- Thanks, you better.

56
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,333
Have to knock you out.

57
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:53,533
(upbeat music)

58
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,733
- Renfroe, did you wash up?

59
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:03,833
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,200
- How about we say the blessing.

61
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,566
Our heavenly Father, we are grateful for your blessings

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,666
and for watching over us through these hard times

63
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,066
across our land.

64
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,733
The bounties that you have given us,

65
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:20,233
we now partake of, we are ever so thankful, amen.

66
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:27,400
D.J., D.J., in the morning, I want you and Renfroe

67
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,233
to make sure you go out there and stack it.

68
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,766
We may have a real bad winter.

69
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,733
- [D.J.] Yes, sir.

70
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:40,000
- Papa, are you expecting it to be real cold this winter?

71
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,433
- It may be, Renfroe.

72
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,766
And we wanna make sure we're ready for it if it is.

73
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,933
- Well, maybe it will snow.

74
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,166
(upbeat music)

75
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,666
- [Papa] It just might.

76
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,400
- D.J., did you hear what Papa said last night

77
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:02,433
at the supper table?

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,366
- I heard him say you need to help me cut

79
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,500
and stack this wood.

80
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,900
- He also said it may snow.

81
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,633
- I figure it'll be hot enough today

82
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,700
when me and Nutty go down to the fishing hole

83
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:16,233
while you stack this wood and daydream about snow.

84
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,966
- D.J., Renfroe!

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,033
D.J., fishing, the fish aren't gonna wait forever.

86
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,900
Whew!

87
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,433
Now, why haven't y'all finished with this wood yet?

88
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,533
- Well, if you get over here and help us stack it,

89
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:37,600
we can get finished a lot quicker.

90
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,666
- [Nutty] Okay, y'all, we gotta hurry up

91
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,966
and get to the fishing hole pretty soon.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,333
Those bass are just gonna up and leave us.

93
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:47,133
- Well, Renfroe's over there daydreaming about snow.

94
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,766
- Y'all remember last Christmas

95
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:51,266
when the third wiseman tripped and fell

96
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,900
at the at the altar during Christmas program?

97
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,300
- Why'd he trip?

98
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,833
- On account of his trick knee, it started acting up

99
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:05,100
and when he was kneeling down at baby Jesus' feet,

100
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,566
the candle flew right out of his hand

101
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,766
right on baby Jesus' manger,

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,266
but of course, it really wasn't the real baby Jesus.

103
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,933
(cast scream)

104
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:20,166
- Fire, the baby!

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,500
(cast scream)

106
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:26,133
♪ Joy to the world ♪

107
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,133
(congregation laughs)

108
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:32,033
♪ Joy to the world, the Lord is come ♪

109
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:36,633
♪ Let earth receive her king ♪

110
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,233
♪ Let every heart ♪

111
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:42,166
♪ Prepare him room ♪

112
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,866
- It wasn't the real baby Jesus.

113
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,166
- Renfroe, Nutty's not stupid.

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,500
He knows it wasn't the real baby Jesus.

115
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,566
- I didn't know.

116
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,266
I didn't know what kind

117
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,266
of Bible training Nutty might have had.

118
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,566
- I sure would've liked to seen that.

119
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,266
My grandparents saw it

120
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,133
and said the whole thing was real funny.

121
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,333
My parents would've liked to have seen it, too.

122
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,733
(light music)

123
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh well.

124
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:18,266
(light music)

125
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:27,466
(light music)

126
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,633
(light music)

127
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,666
(light music)

128
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
- Come on now, let's get out of here.

129
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,233
- You mean it? - Yeah, let's go.

130
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,100
- Yes!

131
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,566
Think them bass will bite?

132
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
- Oh yeah, come on.

133
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,233
- Come on, let's go.

134
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,100
Let's go!

135
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,766
(upbeat music)

136
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:05,533
We'll get a fish and stay away from town.

137
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:06,633
Yeehaw, whoo!

138
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,666
(upbeat music)

139
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,933
- Come on!

140
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:20,433
Last one there is a dead fish.

141
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:23,766
(upbeat music)

142
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
- D.J. and you gotta be more careful

143
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,000
when Nutty's around talking about Christmas here

144
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,866
with our parents and all.

145
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,700
Heard what he said about his parents.

146
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:36,000
It's gonna take him a long time getting over losing them.

147
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,600
- I just forgot.

148
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,600
We didn't mean any harm to Nutty.

149
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,366
He's around here so much,

150
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,533
I kind of feel like he's part of the family.

151
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,900
Don't you, Clara?

152
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:47,900
- Keep in mind what I said.

153
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,500
Holidays are a hard time of the year

154
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,633
for people who've lost folks.

155
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,666
Talk about, mm, fishing.

156
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,933
- I know it's a little bit too soon to be talking

157
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:03,133
about Christmas and all, but I believe I'll be getting lots

158
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
of presents this year.

159
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,500
- Getting presents isn't the chief joy

160
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,166
of Christmas, Renfroe.

161
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,100
- Then what is one of the chief joys?

162
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:16,200
- Well, gift giving is a special pleasure.

163
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:20,300
It is more blessed to give than to receive.

164
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,566
- [Renfroe] I believe I like getting presents best,

165
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,066
no matter what's more blessed.

166
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,466
- I've noticed you've become a little selfish here lately.

167
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,466
- [Renfroe] Is that trough a manger?

168
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,933
- Yes, it is.

169
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:35,566
And you know, Renfroe, whenever I hear the Christmas story,

170
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,733
I can see it all happen right here in this very stable.

171
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,166
Selfishness is something

172
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,333
you can make up your mind to overcome.

173
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:48,233
(light music)

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,866
(birds chirping)

175
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,133
(Renfroe hollers)

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,333
- Renfroe, will you stop it?

177
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,866
(Renfroe hollers)

178
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,733
- Renfroe!

179
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,300
Got Indians after you?

180
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:33,633
(Renfroe shouts) (upbeat music)

181
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,833
- [D.J.] What now?

182
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:46,633
(upbeat music)

183
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,033
(upbeat music)

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,266
- Hey, look at me, D.J..

185
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,233
I'm a champion bull rider.

186
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,100
Woo hoo!

187
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,133
Coming up, come on.

188
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,666
Hurry up and go.

189
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,633
Come on, Renfroe, my grandma's faster than you are.

190
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,233
(upbeat music)

191
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,466
- Y'all wait up.

192
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,100
(upbeat music)

193
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,966
(upbeat music)

194
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,300
(upbeat music)

195
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:55,433
(upbeat music)

196
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,533
- Another panther track.

197
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,033
- A panther track?

198
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:02,100
- Are you sure?

199
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,933
- Yep, we heard it again the other night.

200
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:07,300
- [D.J.] We did.

201
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:11,200
(dramatic music)

202
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:20,500
(dramatic music)

203
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,733
(dramatic music)

204
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:39,633
- Are y'all sure that's a panther track?

205
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,833
- [D.J.] Yep, sure is a panther track.

206
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,000
- I think I wanna go home.

207
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,200
- What are you drawing, Renfroe?

208
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:06,566
- An angel, I'm making a few changes on our old one.

209
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:15,133
(rooster crows)

210
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,466
(bell rings)

211
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,766
- Renfroe Ty Madison, get out of that cupboard.

212
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,000
It's time to go to school, you're gonna be late.

213
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,700
- But Mama, I'm hungry.

214
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,366
- Come put your hat and coat on.

215
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,233
There.

216
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,500
That's right.

217
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,366
Hey, what's that drawing?

218
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,933
- It's my angel.

219
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,266
- Well, it's not Christmas yet,

220
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,266
but it is supposed to get cold today.

221
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,000
Bye. - Bye.

222
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,266
(upbeat music)

223
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,700
(bell rings)

224
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,466
(children cheer)

225
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,300
- Bye, Ms. Watson.

226
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,833
- Bye, Ms. Watson.

227
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:41,133
(upbeat music)

228
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,866
- Go on, go home.

229
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
- Be quiet, you big bully.

230
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,633
- You kids go home.

231
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,433
(upbeat music)

232
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,233
- How was your day?

233
00:15:58,266 --> 00:15:59,200
- Pretty good.

234
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,666
- What's that?

235
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,766
- A secret.

236
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,600
- What you got?

237
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:03,433
- It's a secret.

238
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:04,666
- Tell me.

239
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
- You can't keep a secret, Renfroe.

240
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,300
- Yes, I can.

241
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,033
- No, you can't.

242
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,000
- Yes, I can.

243
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,200
- I know better than that.

244
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,933
- [Renfroe] Give it back!

245
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,166
D.J.!

246
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,566
Buford, that's my hat.

247
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:30,033
- [Clara Mae] Nutty, no, no, no.

248
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,366
Renfroe, you best clear.

249
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,966
- D.J.'s coming, Buford.

250
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,066
He's gonna get you.

251
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,200
- Let this be a warning to you.

252
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,700
Don't mess with my little brother.

253
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,500
- Yeah, Madison, you're scaring me.

254
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,300
- Come on, let's go.

255
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,766
(upbeat music)

256
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,833
- I can't wait, one more week.

257
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:04,033
- One week till what?

258
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,000
- Well, I overheard Ms. Watson say we were getting off

259
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:08,933
for Christmas in a week.

260
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:10,366
Didn't you hear her say that?

261
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,600
- Yeah, I heard her.

262
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,800
Next time that bully Buford Reynolds picks

263
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,066
on another little one, I'm gonna clean his plow.

264
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,333
- But D.J., he's too big for you.

265
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,400
(upbeat music)

266
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,866
- But that Buford does need a good old fashioned whooping.

267
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,633
(Renfroe laughs)

268
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,466
(upbeat music)

269
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,700
- Renfroe, you look like you're out of breath.

270
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:44,566
- Well, I am.

271
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,433
And it's almost Christmas and it's still hot.

272
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,066
- My grandpa says he can't remember

273
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,133
the last time there was a hard cold winter around here.

274
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,866
- Yeah, Papa said he ain't seen snow since he was 11.

275
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,766
- [Renfroe] How long has that been?

276
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,133
- About 30 years.

277
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:09,300
- South Louisiana, it probably ain't gonna snow

278
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,866
for another 30 years.

279
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,766
(Renfroe pants)

280
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,866
- What on earth are you doing?

281
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,266
- Father said he read an article in Farmer's Life Magazine

282
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,700
that said that phonograph records when played to cows

283
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:37,133
in an experiment make them give more milk.

284
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,833
So I thought let's give it a try.

285
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,566
- [Clara Mae] Sounds like a good idea to me.

286
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,733
What song do you have?

287
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,233
- [Renfroe] Silent Night.

288
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:49,200
- That's a good song, we'll play it.

289
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,433
("Silent Night")

290
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,666
("Silent Night")

291
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:13,166
("Silent Night")

292
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,366
("Silent Night")

293
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,900
("Silent Night")

294
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:41,600
("Silent Night")

295
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:51,033
("Silent Night")

296
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:00,966
("Silent Night")

297
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,000
- Clara Mae, Renfroe, what is going on out here?

298
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,566
- Mama, it's Christmas.

299
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,066
- It is Christmas, Mama.

300
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,900
It really is.

301
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,000
- Yes, it is, kids.

302
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,966
Merry, merry Christmas!

303
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,600
("Silent Night")

304
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:32,400
("Silent Night")

305
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,766
Renfroe, get out of that cornbread.

306
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:51,366
You know, being Christmas and all, it might be a good night

307
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,600
to get the decorations down out of the attic.

308
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,466
- Yes'm, it's a wonderful night.

309
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,733
- [Mama] Clara Mae, you and Renfroe need

310
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:00,433
to get washed up for supper.

311
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:01,500
- Yes, ma'am.

312
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:02,733
- Clara Mae, if you'll come back

313
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,766
and help me put those turnip greens in a bowl.

314
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,733
And Renfroe, call your Pa to come to the table, okay?

315
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,200
Where's D.J.?

316
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:10,633
- [Renfroe] Last time I saw him, he was with Nutty.

317
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,400
- They were horsing around by the wood pile.

318
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,700
Probably went to Nutty's grandparents' house.

319
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:17,033
- [Papa] Here, I found them.

320
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,266
Here's the Christmas decorations.

321
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,966
- Oh, great, let's see what we've got.

322
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,100
I always forget from the end of the year

323
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,800
what's in this old box.

324
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,833
It's lots more fun to get them out now, isn't it?

325
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,066
- This was on the tree from last year.

326
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,000
- Wanna make some new ones this year?

327
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,333
Oh, look, here's this old reindeer.

328
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:38,533
Where'd we get this, anyone remember?

329
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,366
- Oh, I remember that.

330
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,166
That was always my favorite Christmas gift.

331
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,333
- It never wanted to stay on too easy.

332
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:53,100
More balls.

333
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:57,100
Well, there's some balls you can put over there.

334
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,033
Mary won't mind.

335
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:02,466
- [Papa] Boy, look at that poor old girl.

336
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,866
I thought she'd fly away before next Christmas.

337
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,700
- She needs to.

338
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:10,500
- [Clara Mae] Oh, she was so pretty when we first got her.

339
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,966
- Hey, don't, don't!

340
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Stop it, D.J., stop it!

341
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:17,766
Don't, D.J., don't!

342
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,233
Don't hurt her!

343
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:21,366
- I have a surprise.

344
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,666
- You do?

345
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,566
- Yes, ma'am. - Well, what would that be?

346
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,933
- It's a secret.

347
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:26,800
- Ah!

348
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,466
I didn't know we had any secrets.

349
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:36,366
Huh, wonder what she's been making.

350
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,333
I guess we could make some more streamers

351
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,133
with this, don't you?

352
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:46,333
That might be pretty.

353
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:51,966
- I thought I'd wait another day or two,

354
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,300
but I decided to bring her on out.

355
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:00,633
She's the present to the family from me.

356
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:02,933
I made her in home ec class.

357
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,866
- Wow, she's lovely, Clara Mae.

358
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:08,766
- [Clara Mae] I made her.

359
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,433
- How did you get the waist to stand up so pretty?

360
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,500
- They have wire in them.

361
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:13,733
- Oh, let me see.

362
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:15,000
It's pretty.

363
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:16,400
- [Clara Mae] They have wire in them.

364
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:17,633
- Wow, she's lovely.

365
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,000
- [Clara Mae] Thank you.

366
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,533
- Mama. - [Mama] What, sweetie?

367
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,800
- If this one ain't gonna go on the tree, can I keep it?

368
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,233
- [Mama] I don't know why not.

369
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:30,966
- Don't tell me you're gonna start playing with dolls.

370
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,966
- I'm going to find a place for her outside.

371
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,933
No.

372
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:47,633
(Papa laughs) (D.J. laughs)

373
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,666
(panther screeches)

374
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:56,733
D.J., D.J.?

375
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,200
D.J.?

376
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,000
Did you hear that?

377
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:08,033
(crickets chirping)

378
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:14,533
(rooster crows)

379
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:17,633
- Boys, it's time to get up.

380
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,500
Wake up.

381
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,300
Did you sleep all right?

382
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:25,133
- Mama, did you hear anything different last night?

383
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,166
I heard a woman screaming.

384
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,400
- You ain't never heard no panther.

385
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:35,733
It sure wasn't a woman.

386
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,200
Mom? - [Mama] What?

387
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,100
- You raised him.

388
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:40,366
- I know.

389
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,533
(harmonica music)

390
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:53,400
- Papa, you expect that panther

391
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:55,233
to be coming through here this year?

392
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:58,800
- Suppose so, Renfroe.

393
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,133
He's been coming through this old creek back in here

394
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,600
for more than five years.

395
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:07,700
- Whew, if I could just get one shot at him,

396
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,500
this'll be his last trip.

397
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:13,800
Pow, pow!

398
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,066
(birds chirping)

399
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:26,533
(rooster crows)

400
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,233
(harmonica music)

401
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,566
(harmonica music)

402
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,966
(harmonica music)

403
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,666
- Hey, Renfroe, you hear the panther last night?

404
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,533
- I sure did.

405
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,000
- You think it was a real panther?

406
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,200
- [Renfroe] Yeah.

407
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,633
- Papa's been hearing it for the last few years.

408
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:27,633
Come on, let's get out of here.

409
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,133
(harmonica music)

410
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,333
- Come on, Renfroe.

411
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:42,166
You just wanna wait there and let the panther get you?

412
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,033
(harmonica music)

413
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:54,566
(harmonica music)

414
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,133
- Yep, it was.

415
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:05,366
Been hearing it all week.

416
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,333
- That must have been one really big panther.

417
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:12,100
- It's small, but it's about that big.

418
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,566
- Yep.

419
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,166
- I'm sure he could eat someone whole like Renfroe.

420
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,433
- Better look out, Renfroe.

421
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:21,166
(Clara Mae yells) (Renfroe screams)

422
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,600
(bell rings) (children cheer)

423
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:25,433
- [Children] Bye.

424
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:26,900
- [Teacher] Bye-bye.

425
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,200
Bye, y'all have a good night.

426
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,033
Bye-bye, y'all have a good day.

427
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,366
Bye-bye. - Bye!

428
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,966
Bye, you have a good day, okay.

429
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,066
- You better watch out, you're pressing your luck.

430
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:45,300
- Stop it.

431
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,533
- That was cruel.

432
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:56,933
- Hey, stop it, you bully!

433
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,600
- Hey, it's a fight, it's a fight.

434
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,600
Come on, come on!

435
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:08,366
(children cheer)

436
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:12,133

(upbeat music)

438

(upbeat music)

439
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:38,666
- Y'all, stop it.

440
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Stop it right now, stop it.

441
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:41,633
- He started it.

442
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,400
He started it, Ms. Watson.

443
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:44,766
- Is this true, D.J.?

444
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,700
- Yes'm.

445
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:47,066
- Get on in that schoolhouse.

446
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,300
D.J.? - [D.J.] Yes'm.

447
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,433
You okay?

448
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,800
You okay?

449
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:56,633
- Yes'm.

450
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:57,633
- Get on home.

451
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,500
- Yes'm.

452
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:07,233
- I'm coming in there, Bruce.

453
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,733
And I'll wring your neck if you try to jump at me.

454
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:15,566
Get back, you scraggly old rooster.

455
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,833
I could wring your neck.

456
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:18,866
Mama's not here to see me do it neither.

457
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:26,966
- Renfroe Ty Madison, you best not ruffle a feather

458
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,133
of my prize rooster.

459
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,666
You just don't know how to talk to him.

460
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
He is capable of listening to you.

461
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:39,700
- I'll ruffle a feather, all right.

462
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:44,500
I'll put a real tight knot on that scrawny old head.

463
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,066
(light music)

464
00:29:56,366 --> 00:30:00,466
- Now, Renfroe, don't you forget what I told you.

465
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:05,666
(rooster crows)

466
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,300

467
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,900
(Renfroe whistles)

468
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,566
- Hey, Nutty, can you help me?

469
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,400
- Come get the ladder over there and I'll get the nail.

470
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,900
- Help me nail it on the top of the snow palace.

471
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:26,766
- Okay.

472
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,466
Oh, this looks like it'll do.

473
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,366
Here you go, Renfroe.

474
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,066
Here, hold this, Renfroe.

475
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,566
(dog barking)

476
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,033
How's that right there?

477
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,200
- Mm-hm, yeah.

478
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,266
- Ta-da! - Perfect.

479
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:24,133
(light music)

480
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:33,233

(light music)

486
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,333
- Get your hat and coat on.

487
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:29,866
Clara Mae, get your coat.

488
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,966
It's time to go to town to do our Christmas shopping.

489
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:37,733

- Boys, get over here

500
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,833
and help me unload the ham out of here.

501
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:03,400
(light music)

502
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:06,366
I wonder what we'll find in the shop today.

503

504
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,933

I got some really nice things.

Ducky, merry Christmas to you.

535
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,866
Yeah, we had a pretty good year.

536

Wow, I may wind up owing you money.

- Let's see here.

542
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:44,466
A good year for hams, so I'm glad.

543
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,833
Boy, well, I owe you 75 cents this year.

544
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,166
- How about that.

545
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,066
- How about a nice knife for Renfroe?

546
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,133
Got some good bargains.

547
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,633
- Young Renfroe's mother would sell me

548
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:59,033
at a bargain if she found out that I paid 75 cents

549
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,766
for a knife on a boy who already has one.

550
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,600
- But one of the blades is broken.

551
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,100
- You know, but however,

552
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,066
you didn't exactly go out of the way to tell her.

553
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,433
- [Papa] If 75 cents would buy two knives,

554
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:12,000
I might consider it.

555
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:14,333
- Well, I've got some real bargains in here all the way

556
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:16,466
from 10 cents to a dollar.

557
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,100
- Renfroe, do you think you could trade out the 75 cents

558
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,033
on a knife for yourself and one for D.J.

559
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:28,166
while I go down to the dry goods store?

560
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,300
- Okay, sir.

561
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,400
- Are you a pretty good trader, Renfroe?

562
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:34,300
- Oh yes, sir.

563
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:38,500
- Okay, let me show you something in here.

564
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:41,433
Oh, I've got some really good bargains in here.

565
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,466
Look at this knife right here, Renfroe.

566
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,333
This thing is just 35 cent.

567
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:52,600
You could get two of those, even have a nickel left

568
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:54,966
to buy some candy with.

569
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,500
What do you think about that?

570
00:36:57,533 --> 00:37:00,100
(light music)

571
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,266
Okay, you have to be careful.

572
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,200
Don't cut your finger with that.

573
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:13,000
Isn't that a nice one?

574
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:14,533
You like that one?

575
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,400
And look at this, Renfroe.

576
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:20,300
It's only 25 cents.

577
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,833
You could get this one and that one for 75 cent.

578
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:27,266
It'd be an even trade.

579
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,066
- Well, I'll take these two. - Okay.

580
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,233
Okay, and wrap this one in a paper.

581
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:37,133
- Okay, and are you gonna put this one in your pocket

582
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,366
or you want me to wrap it?

583
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,900
- Uh-huh, I'll put it in my pocket.

584
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,266
- All right.

585
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,066
Are you anxious for Christmas?

586
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,400
- Oh, yes, sir.

587
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:49,366
- [Peabody] What else you might have gotten?

588
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
- I don't know.

589
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:55,400
- [Peabody] Well, I hope you have a very special Christmas.

590
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:56,966
- I hope you do, too, sir.

591
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,333
- Merry Christmas to you.

592
00:37:58,366 --> 00:37:59,833
- Merry Christmas to you, too, sir.

593
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:01,533
- All right.

594
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:04,066
(light music)

595
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:07,233
Bye. - Bye, sir.

596
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:11,533
(light music)

597
00:38:18,033 --> 00:38:20,533
(light music)

598
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,833
(light music)

599
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,000
(light music)

600
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:48,266
(light music)

601
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,533
- Why, hello there, Renfroe.

602
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:54,900
- Hi, Mrs. Gibbons!

603
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:55,966
- I need to talk to you.

604
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,633
Can we sit for awhile?

605
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:59,600
- [Renfroe] Yes, ma'am.

606
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:02,100
- Christmas is a week from tomorrow

607
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,833
and I'm wondering if I can count on you

608
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:05,133
to be on the program?

609
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:09,433
- Oh, yes, ma'am, you could call on me.

610
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:12,100
- Well, after the pageant, we're going to be having a party

611
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,500
with refreshments and entertainment.

612
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:17,066
I thought you could do one of your imitations.

613
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,833
I heard you're good at them.

614
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:19,700
- I am.

615
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,166
Yes, ma'am, I'll try to make you up one.

616
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,600
- Good, and would you tell Clara Mae and D.J.

617
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,966
that I'd like them to be on the program also.

618
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,133
But I'll talk to them more about it

619
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,633
at Sunday school tomorrow.

620
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,366
- Yes, ma'am, and thank you for asking me.

621
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,733
- Sure, bye-bye.

622
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,100
- Merry Christmas.

623
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,800
(light music)

624
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,366
- Here, it's for you.

625
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,033
Pa don't want you to tell Mom on account

626
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:54,933
of ladies don't always understand boys and knives.

627
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:56,333
- Pa get you one?

628
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:58,133
- Well, a little one.

629
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,500
- Come on, let's get a ride.

630
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,133
(light music)

631
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:14,066
(light music)

632
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:28,033
("Hark, the Herald Angels Sing")

633
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,700
("Hark, the Herald Angels Sing")

634
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:47,566
- Isn't that right, Renfroe?

635
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,800
- What's right?

636
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:52,866
- You having a crush on Ms. Gibbons and all.

637
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,166
- It ain't so!

638
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,433
I ain't gonna tell you the message

639
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,766
that she told me to give y'all.

640
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,133
- What message?

641
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,866
You're making it up.

642
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,100
- What did she say to you, Renfroe?

643
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:04,400
Tell us, does she want us to be

644
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,833
in the Christmas program this year?

645
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,533
- Tell us, Mama's boy, before I put the hurt on you.

646
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:13,300
- Okay, okay, she does, she does!

647
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:16,600
She wants y'all to meet her at Sunday school

648
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:20,300
and I guess she'll give you the parts there.

649
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:25,966
("Hark, the Herald Angels Sing")

650
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:32,833
She asked me to do an imitation

651
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:35,933
that will please young and old alike.

652
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:40,433
- She'll probably want me to be a wiseman.

653
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:42,233
She'll probably want me to play my viola

654
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,533
which she usually ask me again.

655
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:45,100
- Oh, come on, D.J..

656
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:47,000
Everybody likes that viola.

657
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:51,566
It's a true gift and you really should share it.

658
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,400
- Renfroe, you haven't done imitations in two years.

659
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:56,533
You still can't do them.

660
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:58,600
- There is a brain, D.J..

661
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,400
("Hark, the Herald Angels Sing")

662
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,100
("Hark, the Herald Angels Sing")

663
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:29,500
(upbeat music)

664
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,833
And all of the sudden, crazy Nathan started to get up

665
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:35,900
from the front pew.

666
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,600
- Well, it is not good Christmas spirit

667
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:41,000
to refer to poor Nathan as crazy.

668
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:42,633
I know other boys and girls call him that,

669
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:45,633
but I don't wanna ever hear y'all call him that.

670
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,733
- It's uncharitable, Renfroe.

671
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:50,000
- Why, 'cause he's your sweetheart?

672
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:51,733
- And that's unkind, too.

673
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:55,500
Making any kind of joke about Nathan is not nice.

674
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:58,733
- I was glad to hear the Claytons won't have to be moving.

675
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:00,133
- [Mama] How's that?

676
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,033
- I overheard him in the bank the other day.

677
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:05,066
Seems that President Roosevelt has opened up the WPA.

678
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,066
Mr. Clayton took a road job at 35 cents an hour.

679
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,733
He starts after Christmas.

680
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:12,866
- Well, I'm happy for them, especially the children.

681
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,600
Clara Mae, why don't you help me fix a food basket.

682
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:18,166
We'll have plenty and they've had such hard times.

683
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,966
- Yes, ma'am, I'd like that.

684
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,466
- I'm glad they ain't moving.

685
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,200
I like the girls.

686
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,533
- Now, Renfroe, about that imitation,

687
00:43:26,566 --> 00:43:28,666
I don't think anybody wants to be reminded

688
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,966
of what happened at last year's pageant.

689
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,066
So why don't you see if you can't think of another one.

690
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,933
- Yes'm.

691
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,833
- Maybe it's uncharitable of me,

692
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,200
but I don't think anyone could sound as terrible

693
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:41,700
as Mr. Franz Martin.

694
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:43,233
(Clara Mae laughs) (D.J. laughs)

695
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:45,033
- Thanks, Papa, me neither.

696
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,200
- I understand they're sending Nathan to a special school

697
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:51,333
for handicapped children up in the mountains

698
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:52,800
after the holidays.

699
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:55,900
I hear the civic club is paying for him to go there.

700
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,366
Now, Renfroe, about your imitation...

701
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,633
(birds chirping)

702
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:10,800
(thunder rumbles)

703
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:17,966
- [D.J.] Taking all day.

704
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,466
- All right, get back, get back.

705
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,466
Nobody's gonna get a present until I give them to you.

706
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,800
- All right. - Hurry up!

707
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:25,933
- First one for you, Clara Mae.

708
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:27,566
- Come on, Mama.

709
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,633
You're the slowest person--

710
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,666
- I hope that's what you want.

711
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,133
- Grandma Ebony.

712
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:34,800
- I should've put switches in those packages, go.

713
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:36,433
Go ahead, open it, let's see it.

714
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,300
- First, Laura, then Grandma Ebony.

715
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,533
- Look! - Oh wow.

716
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:42,200
- [Mama] Patience, it's a virtue.

717
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:43,633
- [Renfroe] Gimme!

718
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:44,866
- [Mama] Do you like them?

719
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,800
- Oh wow, thank you. - [Renfroe] Mama!

720
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:48,033
- [D.J.] Those are nice, Clara.

721
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:50,100
- I figured for out in the garden.

722
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:52,166
One for you, D.J..

723
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,766
- [Papa] What is it, D.J., charcoal?

724
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,033
- I don't know, it's got a knot in it.

725
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:57,700
- Here's one for you, Renfroe.

726
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:58,633
- Ooh, I got a biggie.

727
00:44:58,666 --> 00:44:59,433
- [Papa] Wow, look at that one.

728
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:00,233
What have you got there?

729
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:01,533
- I wonder what that is.

730
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:03,100
- Looks like a wiener to me.

731
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,433
- [Mama] He knows how to fly.

732
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:05,700
- Oh, I got a yo-yo.

733
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,166
- [Papa] A yo-yo.

734
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:10,366
- [Mama] There you go.

735
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,800
Whoa.

736
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,700
- [Papa] Renfroe, you been wanting a lasso for a long time.

737
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:14,733
Now you have one.

738
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:16,200
- Papa, here's one for you.

739
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:17,433
- Oh wow, looka here.

740
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,366
- Ooh, that pretty paper.

741
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,933
- What do you think it is, guys?

742
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:21,833
- [D.J.] I don't know.

743
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:23,633
- A velvet dress.

744
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,433
It's a velvet dress.

745
00:45:25,466 --> 00:45:27,566
- What I'd do with a dress, Renfroe?

746
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,966
- Thanks, Santa!

747
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,333
- Have you ever played with a yo-yo before?

748
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,933
You look like you know how to do it.

749
00:45:32,966 --> 00:45:34,566
- [Renfroe] Don't worry about a yo-yo.

750
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,100
- A napkin.

751
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,266
- No, these are handkerchiefs for Christmas for church days.

752
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,466
- And this one's for me.

753
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,666
- [Papa] Oh, great, Mama.

754
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,000
- [Clara Mae] Those are nice.

755
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:45,966
- Look, it's my favorite potpourri.

756
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:48,166
- [D.J.] Okay, Mom.

757
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,800
- They fit like a glove.

758
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,600
- Fit just like a glove.

759
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:53,833
- Oh look, it's beautiful!

760
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:55,933
- [Renfroe] What is it?

761
00:45:55,966 --> 00:45:58,466
- Well, it's a comb, a brush and a mirror set.

762
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,800
- [Renfroe] What is that?

763
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:00,800
- [Mama] Look how lovely.

764
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,366
(Renfroe shouts)

765
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,900
Thank you so much.

766
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,066
Oh, I love it.

767
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,033
- [Papa] You're right, a yo-yo.

768
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:11,000
("O Christmas Tree")

769
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:13,266
- [Mama] Oh, there's another one for Renfroe.

770
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,333
- Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!

771
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:16,866
- [D.J.] How many does Renfroe get?

772
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,266
- [Papa] What do you think it could be?

773
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,400
- [D.J.] What is it, Renfroe?

774
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:22,233
- [Papa] What is it, son?

775
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:23,433
- I don't know.

776
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:25,466
Stop asking me that many questions.

777
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,300
- [D.J.] It sounds like it's a...

778
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:30,966
- [Clara Mae] Look!

779
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,166
- This is the best present I've ever had.

780
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,533
- You're welcome, Renfroe, merry Christmas.

781
00:46:36,566 --> 00:46:37,766
- Thank you, Mommy.

782
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,800
- You are welcome, thank you, merry Christmas.

783
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,666
(thunder rumbles)

784
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:49,500
("O Christmas Tree")

785
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:06,700
(birds chirping)

786
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,933
(thunder rumbles)

787
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,933
(thunder rumbles)

788
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,400
- Hush up, you old buzzard!

789
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,433
Don't you have any Christmas spirit?

790
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:42,033
(upbeat music)

791
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:52,800
(upbeat music)

792
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:58,033
(thunder rumbling)

793
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:01,666
(upbeat music)

794
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,566
- Hey there, son.

795
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,100
I was hoping someone would come along

796
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:13,766
and give me the correct time.

797
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,900
- Well, if you don't mind waiting four more minutes,

798
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:19,366
it'd be 10.

799
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,566
- I don't mind waiting.

800
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,933
I have lots of time, it's Christmas.

801
00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:27,000
- Mama, can I go to the Claytons?

802
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:29,400
- That'll be fine, son, but remember

803
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:32,333
that an earache could keep you out of the Christmas program.

804
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:34,600
So put your hat on and make sure your flaps are down

805
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:37,266
over your ears, button your coat up good.

806
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,200
- Yes'm.

807
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:39,100
- Don't be gone too long.

808
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,566
(upbeat music)

809
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:48,933
- Renfroe's coming.

810
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:52,000
Hey, guys, Renfroe's coming.

811
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:53,100
- [Mary Martha] I figured he'd be around here

812
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,866
sometime this morning.

813
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,066
- [Lucy] I bet you did not.

814
00:48:57,433 --> 00:48:59,833
- [Mary Martha] Hey, Renfroe, did Santa come see you?

815
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:01,100
- Sure did.

816
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:02,166
- Merry Christmas, Renfroe.

817
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,700
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

818
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,000
What'd he bring you?

819
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:13,133
- A diamond ring and a velvet dress, plus a few other things

820
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,800
that aren't any of your business.

821
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:21,033
- Oh man, Martha, how come you make up them lies like that?

822
00:49:21,066 --> 00:49:23,666
She got the same as the rest of us.

823
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,666
That's what she got.

824
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,033
- You don't know.

825
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:26,966
I might have hidden my presents

826
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,966
before you got up this morning.

827
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,833
- Hey, Renfroe, I got an orange, an apple and some candy.

828
00:49:33,866 --> 00:49:35,200
- Well, that wasn't hardly worth

829
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:37,533
hanging up a stocking for, was it?

830
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:38,733
- Oh, yes it was.

831
00:49:38,766 --> 00:49:40,266
The candy and apple were good

832
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,733
and I'm saving the orange for tomorrow.

833
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:46,166
- Pretty nice of Santa to leave you that jump rope, Renfroe.

834
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,533
- That's not a jump rope, that's a lasso.

835
00:49:48,566 --> 00:49:51,633
Besides that, I got a yo-yo and this.

836
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:59,066
- My word, that's beautiful!

837
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:03,066
- Reckon the same Santa Claus

838
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,166
that came to your house came to ours?

839
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,700
- Well, let's play jump rope with your lasso.

840
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,233
(upbeat music)

841
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:23,766
(upbeat music)

842
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,933
- Girls, it's supper time.

843
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:34,066
Y'all come on in.

844
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,333
- [Girls] Okay.

845
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,166
- Fried chicken, you can even serve upside down.

846
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,500
- With chops and with chestnuts and a mama and a dad.

847
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:43,666
- We're not having chicken tonight.

848
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,400
Instead, we're having fried steak, pork chops, ice cream

849
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:49,300
and chocolate pie.

850
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:52,200
- [Clarrie] Mary Martha, there you go again

851
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:54,433
making up them whopping tales.

852
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:57,666
- If you go, we won't have a rope to play with.

853
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:01,700
(upbeat music)

854
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:08,500
- [Roosevelt] Now, first of all,

855
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,066
let me assert my firm belief

856
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:17,066
that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

857
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,333
- Amen.

858
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,333
(upbeat music)

859
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:34,366
- [Clara Mae] Pass that salt.

860
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:39,333
- Mrs. Madison, you have outdone yourself this time.

861
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:43,533
("We Wish You A Merry Christmas")

862
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:54,666
("We Wish You A Merry Christmas")

863
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,466
- Papa, do you mind if I do my imitation at the table?

864
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,033
- [Papa] Go ahead, son.

865
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:11,200
- Now, I ain't gonna tell y'all what this is.

866
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:13,766
So y'all are just gonna have to guess.

867
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,333
- This ought to be interesting.

868
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:18,066
(D.J. laughs)

869
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,866
- Imitation by Renfroe Ty Madison.

870
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:27,700
(Renfroe clucks) (Renfroe neighs)

871
00:52:29,933 --> 00:52:32,533
(Renfroe taps)

872
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:36,100
(Renfroe blows)

873
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,866
That's it, now one of you have to try to guess.

874
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,166
- I don't have to guess.

875
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,933
It's a herd of wild horses.

876
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:48,933
- Horses don't rattle, D.J..

877
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:51,966
- Well, it could be a skeleton chasing him

878
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,166
and his old jawbones were rattling.

879
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,000
(Renfroe laughs) - No, D.J., that's not it.

880
00:52:57,033 --> 00:52:58,300
- I'll bet I can get it.

881
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,166
- [Renfroe] Bet you can't.

882
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,633
- I'll bet I can.

883
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:03,466
The neighing and galloping wasn't done by horses,

884
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,233
mules or donkeys.

885
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,533
It was by reindeer.

886
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,133
- No, no, no, not that either.

887
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,766
Guess I'll just have to explain.

888
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:19,233
All right, now,

889
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,733
snow and snow falling on a tin roof.

890
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:30,666
That's why you were so close, Papa, about that rain.

891
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,033
- [D.J.] Sound like a hail storm to me.

892
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,900
- Renfroe, dear, snow doesn't make any noise.

893
00:53:35,933 --> 00:53:38,966
It falls without a sound, but then you wouldn't know that

894
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,566
because you've never seen snow.

895
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,566
- I wish it would snow.

896
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,966
I hear it makes real good ice cream.

897
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,200
- Oh, it does.

898
00:53:49,233 --> 00:53:50,433
It's delicious.

899
00:53:50,466 --> 00:53:52,000
It's the best I've ever had.

900
00:53:52,033 --> 00:53:55,900
- This Christmas, it'll be one to remember.

901
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:58,000
It will snow, snow, snow.

902
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:06,333
(light music)

903
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,200
(light music)

904
00:54:18,966 --> 00:54:22,733
Get down, Belle, you know this tree.

905
00:54:22,766 --> 00:54:23,933
Aw, it's okay.

906
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,333
Well, merry Christmas to you, too.

907
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:32,433
Hey, D.J., Renfroe, come on, guys.

908
00:54:32,466 --> 00:54:34,066
Hurry up!

909
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,266
- Hey, Nutty, what'd you get for Christmas?

910
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:40,266
(Nutty sighs)

911
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:44,433
- [Nutty] Nothing yet.

912
00:54:44,466 --> 00:54:45,300
- Nothing?

913
00:54:47,433 --> 00:54:49,500
- Why, Christmas is almost over.

914
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:50,966
- Now, I know that, Renfroe,

915
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,000
but my grandparents ordered me some new clothes

916
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:56,733
and they just haven't come in yet.

917
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:01,466
(light music)

918
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,000
- Well, didn't they get you anything to play with?

919
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:08,100
- Well, they weren't feeling into going in town

920
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:09,133
as they had planned.

921
00:55:10,366 --> 00:55:12,166
(light music)

922
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,733
Oh, but that's okay.

923
00:55:13,766 --> 00:55:15,066
At least they're feeling better now.

924
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,633
And that's okay, that's much better

925
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:19,633
than any gift I could ever get.

926
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,400
- Too bad they didn't feel better yesterday

927
00:55:21,433 --> 00:55:24,400
when all the stores were open.

928
00:55:24,433 --> 00:55:26,933
(light music)

929
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,233
- Hey, that's pretty nice!

930
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:31,133
But I guess you'll be expecting me to believe

931
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:33,000
that it keeps time.

932
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:35,033
- Believe it and see it keeping time.

933
00:55:35,066 --> 00:55:38,666
That little bitty hand there ticks off every single second.

934
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:44,100
- Hey, D.J., y'all are as good as old man Bruce Watson.

935
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:45,300
- Better, I'd say.

936
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:48,200
- Well, I need some practice.

937
00:55:48,233 --> 00:55:51,800
- Hey, Renfroe, why don't you let me have a try at that?

938
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,933
You know, I'm willing to bet money

939
00:55:57,966 --> 00:55:59,866
that that's what my grandparents were gonna get me

940
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,166
if they'd gone into town.

941
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,733
I need practice on a really nice yo-yo.

942
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:11,400
- Look, y'all, I can yo-yo from the top step.

943
00:56:12,533 --> 00:56:14,266
- Why can't you yo-yo from right there?

944
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,133
- 'Cause the string's too long and he won't cut it.

945
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:18,600
He thinks he's gonna grow into it.

946
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:23,500
- Hey, it's nice, Renfroe,

947
00:56:23,533 --> 00:56:25,400
but why can't you yo-yo from right there?

948
00:56:25,433 --> 00:56:28,200
Renfroe, why don't you let me have a try at that yo-yo?

949
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:30,633
- Here, you have a try.

950
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,033
- Thanks.

951
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,733
Now, how in Sam Hill do you work this thing?

952
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,333
Now, how do I work this thing?

953
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:45,200
- Well, first you make a special knot in the end.

954
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:47,733
(light music)

955
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,433
Here you go.

956
00:56:51,466 --> 00:56:52,300
- Thanks.

957
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,000
(light music)

958
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,266
- Now, D.J., it's worse than before.

959
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,400
Change it back.

960
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:06,900
Great, D.J..

961
00:57:06,933 --> 00:57:08,100
Fix it back, D.J..

962
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,466
Now it's all messed up.

963
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,700
It's worser than before.

964
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:11,966
Fix it back.

965
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,200
- Only if you let Nutty play with it

966
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:14,466
for a little bit longer.

967
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,233
- He can play with it for a little bit longer

968
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,300
and that's all.

969
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,400
- [Nutty] How do you do it, just up and down?

970
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:22,233
- Yeah.

971
00:57:22,266 --> 00:57:23,533
- [Nutty] Okay.

972
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:29,733
- John Brownit, if those ain't snow clouds,

973
00:57:29,766 --> 00:57:31,400
I don't know what is.

974
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,766
- Renfroe, you wouldn't know a snow cloud from a rain cloud.

975
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:39,933
- Uh, look like rain clouds to me, too, Renfroe.

976
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:45,466
(thunder rumbles)

977
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,700
Yep, that's rain clouds all right.

978
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:52,533
- Clara Mae, don't those look like snow clouds to you?

979
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:54,100
- You're daydreaming, Renfroe.

980
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:54,966
Come on.

981
00:57:56,766 --> 00:57:59,033
- Oh no, not milking again.

982
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:03,766
Nutty, return my yo-yo, I need it.

983
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,966
- Here you go.

984
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:11,066
Can I take a turn?

985
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,500
- Maybe I should at least let Nutty have it till tomorrow

986
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,033
or at least till after Christmas clothes, don't you think?

987
00:58:18,066 --> 00:58:20,400
- You should've let him keep it, period, Renfroe.

988
00:58:20,433 --> 00:58:21,966
That's what you should've done.

989
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,600
You could've let Nutty have it.

990
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:24,633
Hey, get up.

991
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,100
- But why should I?

992
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:28,800
Nutty's grandparents have more money

993
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:30,700
than most folks hereabout.

994
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:33,066
Nutty's grandpa is retired from the railroad

995
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,900
and probably can run and buy him all sorts of fancy things.

996
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:37,966
- But he doesn't have anything now.

997
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,066
And now it's Christmas.

998
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,733
You don't have to have all the things you got today.

999
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:45,266
You could've let Nutty have some little something.

1000
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:50,066
You got a watch, you got a lasso and you got a yo-yo.

1001
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:52,466
Anything you would've given Nutty

1002
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,366
would've made him very happy.

1003
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,733
- Course if I were a rich boy and got two or three bicycles

1004
00:58:57,766 --> 00:58:59,833
and a whole wagon load of other stuff,

1005
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:02,500
I'd probably give him at least one of my presents.

1006
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,700
- Ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1007
00:59:05,733 --> 00:59:06,866
- I hadn't heard you sing

1008
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,366
O Come, All Ye Faithful this year.

1009
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,266
- That's right, Renfroe, just change the subject.

1010
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,800
I'll be singing it tonight at the Christmas program,

1011
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,800
but you, young man, in the meantime,

1012
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:18,966
you need to be thinking a lot about sharing.

1013
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:24,000
♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪

1014
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:26,733

1022

- And she brought forth her first born son

1023
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,833
and wrapped him in swaddling clothes

1024
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:20,800
because there was no room for them in the inn.

1025
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:23,833
Glory to God in the highest and on earth,

1026
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:26,500

- Ladies and gentlemen, and children,

1036
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,500
thank you all for being here this evening

1037
01:01:11,533 --> 01:01:14,800
and for making this year's program such a success.

1038
01:01:16,266 --> 01:01:20,333
Everyone did an absolutely splendid job on his or her parts.

1039
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:23,366
And now, we are in for even more entertainment.

1040
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,066
So help yourselves to the refreshments and have a good time.

1041
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,700
(congregation applaud)

1042
01:01:30,733 --> 01:01:33,500
("Silent Night")

1043
01:01:40,433 --> 01:01:43,200
("Silent Night")

1044
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,166
- What would you like Santa to bring you for Christmas?

1045
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,433
- I don't know.

1046
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:53,733
("Silent Night")

1047
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,600
("Silent Night")

1048
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,666
(violin music)

1049
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,266
("Silent Night")

1050
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:29,933
("Silent Night")

1051
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:33,833
- I sell mittens by the pair.

1052
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:36,033
(crowd laughs)

1053
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:38,800
("Silent Night")

1054
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:48,100
("Silent Night")

1055
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,533
- I hear Nathan's going up to the special school

1056
01:02:52,566 --> 01:02:54,200
up in the mountains.

1057
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:57,500
- Oh yeah, he's real excited

1058
01:02:57,533 --> 01:03:02,000
about going to that institution.

1059
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:04,566
I sure will miss him while he's gone.

1060
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,000
But while he's there, he's gonna learn all sorts

1061
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,900
of useful stuff, aren't you, Nathan?

1062
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,600
- What sorts of useful things?

1063
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:16,866
- I don't know exactly, but I've heard

1064
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,933
they've got experts there who can teach people like Nathan

1065
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:21,966
to do some stuff by themselves.

1066
01:03:26,466 --> 01:03:30,333
- Well, you think Nathan would care to see my watch?

1067
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:39,100
Oh yes, it's the finest thing I've ever owned by myself.

1068
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:42,433
- [Sister] Cool, Nathan, isn't that beautiful?

1069
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,166
- I never knew he could smile.

1070
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,766
- Of course he can, he just doesn't do it very often.

1071
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,533
Now, give the watch back and we must thank Renfroe

1072
01:04:01,566 --> 01:04:03,400
for letting us see it.

1073
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:07,333
(light music)

1074
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,833
(light music)

1075
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,300

1076
01:04:36,866 --> 01:04:39,266

1077
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:48,333
(bell tolls)

1078
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:55,866
- I've decided I want Nathan to have my watch.

1079
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:02,933
- Why, we wouldn't dream of letting you give it up.

1080
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:06,066
- Maybe Nathan would have more time at that institution

1081
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,000
to admire it than I will at school.

1082
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:12,300
- But it's the finest thing you've ever owned.

1083
01:05:13,466 --> 01:05:15,000
You even said so yourself.

1084
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,800
You must keep it.

1085
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,700
- No, I want Nathan to have it.

1086
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:28,833
- It's just too generous of you.

1087
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:34,600
You must be the most unselfish boy in the whole wide world.

1088
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,433
(light music)

1089
01:05:46,066 --> 01:05:48,566

01:05:56,766 --> 01:05:59,166
(bell tolls)

1091
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:04,366
- Whoa, slow down there, boy.

1092
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,100
Your mother's in the wagon and she's waiting on you.

1093
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:07,166
She's getting cold.

1094
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,666
Where have you been?

1095
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,900
- Papa, I've got lots to tell you

1096
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:14,200
and some other stuff, too.

1097
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:15,033
- Well, all right.

1098
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:15,866
Well, let's go see.

1099
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:16,733
Let's go talk about it.

1100
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,333
(children cheer)

1101
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,600
Everybody in here?

1102
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,800
Let's go home.

1103
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,700
Come on, let's go.

- [Renfroe] There is really no way I can describe how I felt

1111
01:07:43,533 --> 01:07:47,066
when I saw those big white snowflakes drifting down out

1112
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,000
of the darkness that Christmas night.

1113
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:53,433
I felt God must've been saying to me,

1114
01:07:53,466 --> 01:07:57,266
Renfroe, for what you did at church tonight for Nathan

1115
01:07:58,466 --> 01:08:00,833
and your act of unselfishness,

1116

I'm sending you my Christmas gift.

1117
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:09,100
And the next morning, white snow covered the ground

1118
01:08:09,133 --> 01:08:10,733
in rural Louisiana.

1119
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,366
Father said it was truly God's miracle.

1120
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,866
For a long time, D.J. and I looked for that old angel

1121
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,000
that was nailed up on the barn.

1122
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,000
