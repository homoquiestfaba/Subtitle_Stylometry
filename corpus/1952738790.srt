<i> Do not want to be me </i>

<i> I'm here ... I am Elizabeth </i>

Elizabeth ...

00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:46,956
WELCOME TO YOUR DESTINATION <i>, Hagen </i>

12
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,721
<i> gave you the opportunity to choose </i>

13
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:54,288

14
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,263
Instead <i> chose HELL </i>

15
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,000
What are you talking about?

16
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,618
<i> Elizabeth is dead, Hagen </i>

17
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,780
Torn <i> for all eternity,
by the plague that infected </i>

18
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,741
<i> You could've left it all behind </i>

19
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:11,161
<i> Instead, you came here </i>

20
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:14,412
<i> So you ... you will be ...</i>

21
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,314
<i> PUNISHED </i>

22
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,195
It is normal, you know ...

23
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,084
the body deteriorates rapidly

24
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,225
We all have to go through it

25
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:33,668
So you should not feel panicked at
is happening

26
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:37,510
It happens

27
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:41,244
You know ...

28
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:44,583
You can return to my ...

29
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,839
it sounds funny

30
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:48,824
Really ..

31
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,358
Although it is not fresh out ...

32
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:53,890
Previous Bacteria

33
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:58,373
Emptied the contents of your
intestines

34
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:00,693
I digested

35
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:09,085
You will have stomach pain,
then see what to do ...

36
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,764
There is always a way ...

37
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,348
When you're ready

38
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,425
return to my

39
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,638
I know that death will not leave

40
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:29,462
Become an obstacle

41
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,474
You are a very strong woman

42
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:38,958
So when you're ready
return to my

43
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,287
Let's get you out of here

44
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:58,194
There are only a few minutes
of the day

45
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,310
I keep fit

46
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:29,491
It can not even see me

47
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,571
but you can hear me

48
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:45,245
You hair is falling

49
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:47,176
but never mind

50
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:50,587
I can buy some

51
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:53,380
There is always a way

52
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,160
Perhaps some extensions when you return

53
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:30,560
I know you love me

54
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:34,069
You always have

55
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,746
and I love you too

56
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,094
No matter ... who are

57
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:51,046
... Or what you could have
become ...

58
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:57,115
... I love you.

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,037
Really

60
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:58,691
I remember when he died ..

61
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,813
tell me one thing ...

62
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:06,784
did not want to put against you

63
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,361
I was just sad

64
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,411
You said

65
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:15,097
would come back

66
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:29,646
I felt that you were not fooling me

67
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,010
I mean ...

68
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:31,416
Your body is not resisting

69
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,221
I fear that when you return

70
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,920
nothing left to what you back ...

71
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,264
... You just come back ...

72
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:54,226
Screw this

73
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:23,694
Sorry, this closed

74
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:25,590
The barber is not in the house

75
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:31,073
I said that this closed

76
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,360
The barber was and
took all the money

77
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:38,525
What?

78
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:42,004
Do not want to shave you?

79
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,659
We are not stupid, Hagen

80
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:02,933
We were watching everything
you did with it

81
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,067
every night ...

82
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:07,262
... In the same place ...

83
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,414
not to speak, I have
anyone

84
00:10:13,415 --> 00:10:14,415
Hagen!

85
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:16,266
Fuck the money!

86
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,101
I'm talking about your wife

87
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,480
the bathrooms ...

88
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,395
necrophilia ...

89
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,040
You did it for a long time, Hagen

90
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,625
and frankly, a little disturbing

91
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,538
You're lying

92
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,293
She was on vacation

93
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,987
So cheating on your wife these
with a corpse?

94
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,960
Take what you want and go, please

95
00:10:58,961 --> 00:11:06,346
Hagen ... I know what is best
for you

96
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:08,086
and see ... I have something you
really want

97
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:09,685
You do not know what I want

98
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:13,178
On the contrary, I think I know

99
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,183
Do not try to get angry or things will get
Here ugly

100
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,716
Just listen to me

101
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,954
We watch your nights
her endless

102
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,058
Without moving, cold as stone

103
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,405
very very dead

104
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:36,198
Do not get me wrong, no
I oppose what you do

105
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,176
In fact, I understand

106
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,865
Really, too lost someone close once

107
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:47,339
my brother ... Tomas

108
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,886
If I could turn back

109
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
I would ensure you are never out of my hand

110
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:55,959
but it was too late

111
00:11:56,478 --> 00:11:58,098
they already had cremated

112
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,548
was nothing more than a pile of ashes

113
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,353
If only I'd known then ...

114
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:09,662
But now

115
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:12,723
now

116
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,508
know

117
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:19,037
I know a way to bring them in death

118
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:21,492
What do you mean by "get them"?

119
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:24,285
You say that people come back from the dead?

120
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:31,136
Exactly, you will see ... death is only
separation of soul and body

121
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,173
Sometimes the spirit leaves the body

122
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:42,989
wandering ... to find another

123
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:45,466
-What you say is ...
-That I can unite again

124
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,133
Both are crazy

125
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,074
We are not us
pick up a corpse

126
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:57,726
You are right

127
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,981
What if we crazy?

128
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:08,300
What if all this shit mambo iambic
is nothing but a lie?

129
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:18,050
and your wife is leaving
nothing but dust ... away from you forever

130
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,286
But what if ... WHAT IF ..

131
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,366
... you had a chance?

132
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,000
an opportunity that I will give

133
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:28,881
getting it again

134
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,388
and then you will spend the rest of your life
wondering

135
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,147
would have happened if you had
taken that risk

136
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:40,954
Will not you take the chance?

137
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:42,949
Did not you do?

138
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:49,173
Vamos

139
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:53,060
Take your shit and we

140
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:11,483
Stay there ... alli

141
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:30,615
So, what do you do?

142
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:38,144
I'm looking for buried treasure

143
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,240
He is silent

144
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,618
This dumb, do not be stupid

145
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,180
What are you doing?

146
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:02,793
Do not worry

147
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,711
These are maps

148
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:10,858
Show me where
found the gates of hell

149
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,320
"Hell?

150
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:16,636
The portals to the other side, I say the
Gates of Hell

151
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:20,281
because someone you really deserve to go
to heaven?

152
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,694
Here then is where
they travel?

153
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,658
Correct

154
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:32,659
When the body dies ...

155
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:37,503
the soul passes through these
holes

156
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:39,920
these doors to other dimensions

157
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:43,885
Have you ever found?

158
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:46,417
If ... found a

159
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:50,420
and saw a

160
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,291
"And they look like?

161
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,200
-A no
- Nothing?

162
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:59,529
Not look like anything, Hagen,
are empty, dark

163
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:01,913
are large holes in the blue

164
00:16:01,914 --> 00:16:03,754
Use your imagination

165
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,074
That makes no sense

166
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,880
Find a place where there is a
door

167
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,540
But without the key I can not open

168
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,127
not what's on the other hand,
not to where it opens

169
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,923
No where to be closed

170
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,583
So ... as we find this key?

171
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:32,869
Here is my friend ... is where you enter

172
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,934
What are you doing Travis?

173
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:42,857
Travis! Please do not do this!
Please do not do it, Travis!

174
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:46,392
You will be my key to open
that door

175
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:48,236
Let me go!

176
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,994
Give me that!

177
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,115
Relax, it will not hurt

178
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:04,523
I lied! You said you'd bring
Elizabeth!

179
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,292
I lied

180
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,582
Nooo ... Hagen not lied to you ...

181
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:12,693
Let's bring Elizabeth

182
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:15,834
but I need someone to go to
hell and take

183
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:19,276
You are a coward A coward!

184
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:21,003
Give me that knife

185
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:25,759
You are right that I am a coward
not what's on the other side

186
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,495
but if I never turn back

187
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,503
so I send you,
you'll be my guinea pig

188
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,172
Are you ready?

189
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,999
We will monitor every move you make

190
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,632
Your breathing, heart rate, all

191
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:55,573
When you get there, Hagen
Elizabeth finds and bring it back

192
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:58,091
and one more thing ...

193
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:00,470
Morbeus greets from me ...

194
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,234
Have you seen?

195
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:00,718
<i> I have done more to see it </i>

196
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:04,921
I'm here for Elizabeth

197
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,297
Just take me with her

198
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,139
and I'll go in peace

199
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,455
<i> Peace </i>

200
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:14,360
<i> How can you talk about peace
after the pain you caused me </i>

201
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,736
<i> You're in my tears </i>

202
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,841
<i> You knew of my suffering </i>

203
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:23,565
<i> now introduce you to yours </i>

204
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:14,716
11 months ago

205
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,676
Well Travis, appear to have passed
5 weeks

206
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:25,771
I have a check for you

207
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,436
here's your check

208
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,625
You know, we need to talk

209
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,457
I know my parents left me
more money than this

210
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,452
I think we can use it now

211
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,256
Have you seen the conditions under which we live?

212
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:48,907
The clauses of the will of your parents
specifically say

213
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:52,738
that money goes to your brother, $ 300
a week

214
00:21:53,197 --> 00:21:55,568
- I'm sure ...
"No more money

215
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:58,790
I am sure that when making a will
300 dollars a week was a lot of money

216
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,045
Now it's nothing,

217
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:03,698
and had not wanted ...
God, listen

218
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:08,877
Sorry, the will of their parents is irrevocable
I can not do anything about

219
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:19,889
Look ... I loved my parents, was very close to them
and I'm not trying to take profit from his death

220
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,744
Tomas love is all I have
I just want the best for

221
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:28,695
No doubt Travis

222
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,340
Damn!

223
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,560
Okay

224
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,325
Come to dinner

225
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:38,361
Then I have to go to work
OK?

226
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,261
Hey, stop

227
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,880
Tom, look

228
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,053
Tom, stop

229
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,862
We've been through this
a million times

230
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:55,134
No no dinner napkin

231
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:59,670
Tom, stop, stop

232
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,670
DEMONS!
STOP!

233
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:17,468
I'm sorry, okay?

234
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:19,878
Tom I'm sorry, okay?

235
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:22,806
Stop, relax

236
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:25,439
Sorry

237
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,035
Things are tough now

238
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,663
And just try to do the best for you
I do what I can, ok?

239
00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:34,996
We'll be fine, ok?

240
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:43,885
Come, eat

241
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:46,376
Open your mouth

242
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,145
OK?

243
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,650
This will not work

244
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,491
Do not cry Tomas, is broken

245
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,000
Damn!

246
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,267
Look, look!

some people said that alcoholics
do not lie

504
01:02:54,017 --> 01:03:00,982
Did you know that the Nazis put the alcohol they
directly through the veins ...?

What do you think?

513
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:27,109
Sometimes I wonder if ...

01:04:27,288 --> 01:04:30,694
if the baby will feel sick
when we do

515
01:04:30,945 --> 01:04:34,842
The baby is fine
Also I am a gentleman

516
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:39,758
I wonder what would you do if I was not

01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:45,000
Do not know

01:04:55,668 --> 01:04:58,763
I promise that I'll

- If

523
01:05:03,674 --> 01:05:05,736
I have my ways

524
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:06,955
Oh, yeah?

525
01:05:07,442 --> 01:05:08,549
Maybe

526
01:05:12,064 --> 01:05:16,672
or maybe I'm reading a lot
of garbage written Morbeus

527
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:20,792
you know, spells and stuff

528
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:22,750
Why do you keep him?

529
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:27,520
"Baby, come on, we've been through this
- But I never gave a straight answer

531
01:05:31,102 --> 01:05:33,530
I like to have someone who loves me

- I love you!

Is different

534
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:41,058
Maybe I have just scared of breaking
his heart

535
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:43,158
This is going to go crazy

536
01:05:44,044 --> 01:05:45,863
and is going to be getting worse

537
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:49,519
And then what?

538
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:52,216
- You and me?
- Of course

539
01:05:53,173 --> 01:05:57,871
"I'm hoping to break that losing
- I would rather die ...

540
01:05:59,154 --> 01:06:05,000
Just think of it, living with
broken heart

541

God! I wish to die and I
avoid all these concerns

542

- What?

545
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:29,303
Would you?

What is this?

551
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,383
"It's for Morbeus
"Yes, but it is?

552
01:07:56,384 --> 01:07:57,766
It forboside

553
01:07:57,767 --> 01:08:00,053
This is to kill baby bees

554
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,458
This is good for killing humans

555
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,225
Yes, but it contains an ingredient
if you kill him

556
01:08:07,226 --> 01:08:10,543
It kills people. Do you understand what these
saying?

557
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:15,798
Listen, I will not go to prison
Let's sit down and think about it

558
01:08:15,799 --> 01:08:19,222
it's crazy
- I've had much time to think, Hagen

559
01:08:19,223 --> 01:08:21,321
You're not the one who has
live with this idiot

560
01:08:21,322 --> 01:08:23,440
- You know, I do not like you're here pe ...
- Do it for me!

561
01:08:23,441 --> 01:08:25,410
Hey, this is crazy

562
01:08:25,411 --> 01:08:29,376
How often should I repeat?
We are talking about killing a man!

563
01:08:29,377 --> 01:08:32,116
For us to be together
- Baby, this is crazy

564
01:08:32,117 --> 01:08:36,586
If you're going to do it, do it
tonight

565
01:08:37,227 --> 01:08:39,560
I think I suspected

566
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:43,685
It's just a matter of time
so you know

567
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:51,917
I want to be with you, this baby is yours
and I want this to her real father, TU

568
01:08:53,015 --> 01:08:54,165
Would you marry me?

569
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:56,056
Of course it makes

570
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:58,276
I'll be yours

571
01:08:59,058 --> 01:09:03,520
and when he's gone Morbeus
Nothing will stand in our way

572
01:09:03,524 --> 01:09:06,738
So is true love, right?

573
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:09,674
- I love you
- Me too

574
01:09:10,262 --> 01:09:14,568
- Do it for me
- I love you I'll do anything for you

575
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:18,003
Oh God! I'm crazy for you

576
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,561
What do we do now?

577
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:45,016
We must get rid of the body

578
01:09:48,324 --> 01:09:49,319
Bring it up

579
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,410
Bring it up!

580
01:09:59,274 --> 01:10:02,462
Take the keys

581
01:10:08,552 --> 01:10:10,769
Kill!

582
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,650
Why do not you die?

583
01:10:20,914 --> 01:10:22,887
Only Muerete

584
01:10:22,888 --> 01:10:25,264
There is nothing here for you

585
01:10:25,265 --> 01:10:27,259
the baby is not yours

586
01:10:38,175 --> 01:10:41,494
Suel ... I ta ...

587
01:10:52,959 --> 01:10:55,115
Die, you piece of shit!

588
01:10:55,116 --> 01:10:57,597
It's my baby! She is mine!

589
01:10:57,598 --> 01:11:00,437
She is mine! Die!

590
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:49,089
I can talk

591
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,314
I'm dead

592
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:03,324
<i> Very killed </i>

593
01:12:08,803 --> 01:12:11,819
<i> not cry so, Morbeus </i>

594
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:14,833
<i> Is not this what you wanted? </i>

595
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:17,596
<i> Your own personal hell </i>

01:12:17,597 --> 01:12:22,225
<i> one that you created with your own will </i>

597
01:12:23,752 --> 01:12:25,300
The mate

598
01:12:30,272 --> 01:12:33,182
The mate and I'm in hell

599
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:40,739
<i> Are you disappointed that there is no fire
or stones called </i>

600
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:45,588
<i> just a boring place without beginning or end </i>

601
01:12:45,589 --> 01:12:46,970
I did not want ...

602
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:49,205
Save yourself the tears <i>, Morbeus </i>

603
01:12:49,206 --> 01:12:55,093
<i> She deserves everything that happened.
She betrayed you </i>

604
01:12:55,094 --> 01:12:58,145
<i> And I take away your child </i>

605
01:12:58,146 --> 01:13:00,258
She did not deserve this

606
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,530
She put both
