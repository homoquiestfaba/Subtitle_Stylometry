00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Aah!

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Girl, quiet.

3
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,600
You'll wake up the dead.

4
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,640
It was a nightmare.

5
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,160
Enough about nightmares.

6
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,680
You've got to be on your way

7
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680

 up for breakfast.

8
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
Look alive, girl.

9
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
You'll never be hired 
 looking cow-eyed.

10
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,360
I write this note.

11
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,360
I told your mother 
 I'd do what I could,

12
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,400
and now I done it.

13
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,400
Put your hat over your face.

14
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
Your mug's been in the papers.

15
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
You can't tell them the truth,

16
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,000
or they'll send you packing.

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,520
and God hates a liar,

18
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,560
so just keep your mouth shut. 
 You hear me?

19
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,080
Keep your mouth shut.

20
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,120
Well, hurry now.

21
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,640
Go on.

22
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
Can't you talk?

23
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, Lorraine,

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
of course she can talk.

25
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,560
Will you let me eat sweets?

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,080
Lorraine.

27
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,120
She gets far too 
 many sweets as it is.

28
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,160
Her father cannot say no.

29
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,160
Will you paint with me 
 and read me stories?

30
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,200
Of course she will, 
 won't you, Alice?

31
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,240
Oh, yes, ma'am.

32
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,760
Has Trevor got one of 
 his famous smiles for Alice?

33
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,800
LORRAINE: Our nanny 
 walked out on us.

34
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,840
Well, not quite,

35
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,360
but she did leave us in a pickle.

36
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
We need to find a 
 replacement quickly.

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,400
We're going on a big boat!

38
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,440
That's right, dear.

39
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Tomorrow we get on a 
 big boat for New York.

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,480
Would you like Alice 
 to come with us?

41
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,040
I don't know.

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Well, of course you do.

43
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,080
What about you, Trevor?

44
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,160
Do you like Alice? Hmm?

45
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Maybe you should hold him.

46
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
I'd like him to get used to you

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,200
before we sail.

48
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,400
You're supposed 
 to hold his head.

49
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,920
Uh, the note said

50
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,960
that you've had 
 experience with babies.

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,480
I mean, that's imperative.

52
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, yes, ma'am. 
 I got experience.

53
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
I love children.

54
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,040
I-- It's just nervous, that's all.

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
Ohh, well, there's no need 
 to be nervous around us.

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,640
We're just regular people.

57
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,160
The most important thing

58
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,200
is that you give our 
 children loving care.

59
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,760
Oh, my heavens, what 
 a lucky girl you are.

60
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,800
You'll be sailing on the Titanic.

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Is the crew in order?

62
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Aye, it's a fine bunch, sir.

63
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,400
I know quite a few of them.

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,440
Most come from the same 
 neighbourhood here in southampton,

65
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,960
but these 900 men never 
 sailed together as a crew before,

66
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,000
so there's a bit of confusion.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Still, all in all, they're as proud 
 a bunch as I've ever seen.

68
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Indeed, to serve 
 aboard this vessel.

69
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,640
Uh, also, Captain, well, 
 to serve under you.

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,160
Well, thank you, Mr. Lowe.

71
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,200
There's always a bit of 
 apprehension on a maiden voyage,

72
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
but I have the greatest faith

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,760
in all of my officers and men,

74
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,280
including yourself, sir.

75
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,280
Now I'm afraid I must face

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,840
the most perilous 
 part of the voyage--

77
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,880
meeting all of those reporters.

78
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,920
We have here the largest movable 
 manmade structure in the world.

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,960
A supership, if you will.

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,480
11 stories high. 
 5 city blocks long.

81
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,520
A boat this big, it has to 
 be slower than Lusitania.

82
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
Does the Lusitania 
 have a library,

83
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
a swimming pool, 
 turkish baths?

84
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
We're offering luxury. 
 A colossal showcase.

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,640
And I can assure you, young man,

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,680
that this ship will give the 
 Lusitania a run for her money.

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,720
Is it your vision, Mr. Ismay, 
 or the owner's?

88
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,240
Well, in all fairness 
 to J.P. Morgan,

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,280
may I remind you that my father 
 founded the white star line.

90
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,800
Now, I, as managing director,

91
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,840
intend to bring it 
 into the 20th century.

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,360
Ah, here he is our Captain.

93
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,400
Captain Smith, is it true 
 you're retiring after this voyage?

94
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
That's true.

95
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,440
Will you be writing a book 
 about your adventures?

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,480
Well, it'd be a very 
 short book, I'm afraid.

97
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,000
I haven't had much adventure.

98
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
What about wrecks, accidents?

99
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Well, there've been winter squalls

100
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,560
and storms and fog,

101
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,640
but I've never had any... 
 adventure worth writing about,

102
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,160
certainly not recording 
 for posterity.

103
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,240
I'm afraid that I enjoy 
 uneventful sea voyages.

104
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,760
Like the one you're 
 embarking on, sir?

105
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Exactly.

106
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,800
Shipbuilding has become 
 such an art now

107
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,840
that disaster is...

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,880
unthinkable.

109
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
My job has become, um...

110
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Uh, effortless.

111
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,440
Thank you.

112
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960

 out the dining room.

Oh, yes, please.

115
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,040
For your information,

116
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,560
we are stocked with 
 75,000 pounds of fresh meat...

117

and 1,120 pounds of 
 marmalades and jams.

119
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
And of course,

Yes, "Sandeman Port, 1870."

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280

124
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,800
And we have-- uh, not there!

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320

128
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
Uh, they should be a darker green.

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,400
They will be repainted 
 before the next sailing,

130
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
you can be sure of that.

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,440

00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,200
I may never see them again.

365
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,280
I brought my mother's 
 nightcap from the clothesline.

366
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,800
It's all I have of her.

367
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,840
Well, more than I have of mine.

368
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,880
I look for a better life.

369
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,400
Yeah, me, too.

370
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,920
Oh, my heart is divided.

371
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,960
Yeah, well, it's better 
 you don't have a heart.

372
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,520
An emigrant must have courage.

373
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,080
You have to keep 
 thinking of that,

374
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,600
to be grateful to be on 
 this beautiful ship.

375
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,160
This is nothing.

376
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Steerage.

377
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Now, up there in first class,

378
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,720
they got gold mirrors 
 and crystal chandeliers.

379
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,760
What is this first class?

380
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,800
We'll all get to America 
 at the same time.

381
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,360
Yeah, but they get there in style.

382
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
That's where I plan 
 to do business,

383
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,440
there in first class.

384
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,000
It don't take courage,

385
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
it takes smarts.

386
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,080
Throw that bit of 
 raggedy cap away.

387
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,120
Let go of the past.

388
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Hey!

389
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Uh, this gate is locked.

390
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,480
Well, now, that is 
 the idea, isn't it?

391
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,520
Steerage can't mingle 
 amongst the other passengers.

392
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,040
Why?

393
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,560
Yank immigration laws, on 
 account of infectious diseases.

394
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,600
Well, I'm not asking 
 you to kiss me.

395
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Ha ha.

396
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,120
Just let me through.

397
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,640
I'm not about to lose my 
 stripes on the first day out.

398
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,200
I just want a look around.

399
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,720
Nobody will know the difference.

400
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
In that suit?

401
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
What's wrong with 
 my bloody suit?

402
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,360
# I gave my love a cherry #

403
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,920
# What had no stone #

404
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Come on, let's go.

405
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,000
# I gave my love a chicken #

406
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,040
- # That had no bone # 
 - Trevor's cold, Alice.

407
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,080
Please, it's cold out here.

408
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,600
# I gave my love-- #

409
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,120
It's night, Alice.

410
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,160
Trevor needs his supper. 
 You're supposed to take care of us.

411
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,720
Stop whining.

412
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Stop whining.

413
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,760
Stop whining.

414
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,920
Come on, Alice.

415
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,440
Excuse-- excuse, please, 
 these children.

416
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,960
Did you see Mrs. Astor?

417
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,000
Mrs. Astor?

418
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Mrs. John Jacob Astor?

419
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,040
You don't know who 
 John Jacob Astor is?

420
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,600
The richest man in the world?

421
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,640
I think I know you.

422
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,160
Were you in Cairo last month

423
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
with the Hendersons' baby?

424
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,200
I never been to Cairo.

425
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Oh, Mrs. Astor.

426
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,760
Your cape.

427
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
You'll catch cold.

428
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
And in your condition...

429
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,360
it's chilly out here. 
 You can't be too careful.

430
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,880
You're right, Miss Miller.

431
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,400
I keep telling my wife that.

432
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,920
Now promise me you 
 will eat a good dinner.

433
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,440
They say a body 
 needs these things

434
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,000
they've discovered 
 called Vitamins.

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,520
She eats like a bird, you know.

436
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,560
She's eating for two now, and 
 she's not getting her Vitamins.

437
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,080
Ha ha ha ha ha.

438
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,160
Just a few more moments, 
 John, please,

439
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,680
before we have to walk 
 into the dining room.

440
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,720
I have to be calm-- ha--

441
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,760
and regal when they 
 all start to gossip.

442
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,320
Come, my dear.

443
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,360
[ music plays ]

444
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
[ laughing ]

445
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,920
Mr. Astor, Mrs. Astor.

446
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,000
Mother Foley, the Astors.

447
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,760
Ah!

448
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,560
I should think they would 
 be dining in their stateroom.

449
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,600
I mean, the nerve, They must 
 have boarded at Cherbourg.

450
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,120
Mr. Astor is a frequent 
 passenger on the white star line.

451
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,160
But not with her. 
 I know the real Mrs. Astor,

452
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,680
the first Mrs. Astor.

453
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,200
They say she's expecting.

454
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,240
Well, she could have a 
 litter of little Astors,

455
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,760
but she will never be 
 accepted in polite society.

456
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,800
Ah, the hell with polite society.

457
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,840
They got each other 
 and the U.S. Mint.

458
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
Oh, excuse me.

459
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,840
Captain Smith.

460
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,000
Ah, how may I 
 assist you, madam?

461
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,520
It's about Lulu.

462
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,040
Uh, your daughter?

463
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,080
Oh-- ha-- actually, 
 my granddaughter.

464
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,600
We are always mistaken.

465
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,640
Captain, I was wondering,

466
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,680
perhaps you might know of 
 some nice gentleman on board

467
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
who might be of some 
 company to Lulu,

468
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,720
someone dignified,

469
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,760
substantial.

470
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,760
Someone like yourself, only--

471
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,800
only, uh, younger.

472
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,840
No, no, no, no, not younger.

473
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
Lulu is so incomplete.

474
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,400
Uh, an older man 
 would be helpful.

475
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,920
No, I-- I meant someone...

476
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,960
Well-to-do. Wealthier.

477
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,000
Exactly. The trip to 
 europe was disastrous.

478
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,040
All the men are 
 foreigners, fortune hunters.

479
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,560
Well, I promise you,

480
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,120
I will keep my eyes open.

481
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,160
Oh, thank you, Captain.

482
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,800
Another bottle, sir?

483
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
I'd like it before we get to 
 New York, if you don't mind.

484
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,400
[ laughter ]

485
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,920
Good health!

486
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,560
This is my third crossing 
 with the captain,

487
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,080
and last time I even 
 sat at his table.

488
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,600
25 years, is it?

489
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,640
With the white star line, yes.

490
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,680
The world's greatest ship and 
 the world's greatest captain.

491
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,760
Here's to a rip-roarin' 
 maiden voyage for us Titanic.

492
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,280
Well, since it is my last voyage,

493
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,840
I was hoping for 
 something a little calmer.

494
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
How fast are we going, Captain?

495
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,880
I have a wager on 
 with Allison here.

496
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,440
I say we're traveling 
 in excess of 20 knots.

497
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,960
If you will excuse me.

498
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
Captain Smith doesn't 
 like to talk about speed,

499
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,520
but I think it's safe to say that 
 Mr. Allison owes you some money.

500
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Ohh.

501
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,120
Now, Mrs. Brown, would you 
 care for some more oysters?

502
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,120
Ooh! Don't mind if I do.

503
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,640
They're delicious.

504
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,680
Big and fat and juicy.

505
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,240
Oh, and some more-- some 
 more wine, please?

506
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,760
Lafite-Rothschild.

507
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,800
We don't get wine 
 like this in Denver.

508
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,320
Boy, you built some 
 rowboat here, Mr. Ismay.

509
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,360
Well, I'm glad you're 
 impressed, Mrs. Brown.

510
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,400
Yes, I was determined to 
 create a ship for the 20th century.

511
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
One must be a visionary.

512
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
Now, may I recommend 
 the pressed pheasant,

513
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,000
or perhaps the, uh, poularde 
 poche a l'estragon.

514
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,520
Ha ha. No skinny little 
 poularde for me.

515
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,040
I'm havin' roast mutton,

516
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,560
agneau et mouton.

517
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,120
You speak french?

518
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I hired a french tutor.

519
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,200
He pulled a cork from a champagne 
 bottle and put it in my mouth--

520
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,720
The cork, not the bottle.

521
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,760
He said it'd force me to hold 
 my mouth open when I talk.

522
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,320
Well, I told him most people 
 preferred me with my mouth shut.

523
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
- Ha ha ha ha. 
 - Ha ha ha ha.

524
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
We are forgetting Mrs. Paradine.

525
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
All this festivity.

526
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,440
Poor darling. Her dear Aunt 
 Grace passed recently in London.

527
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,480
All those months 
 alone in London,

528
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,040
taking care of the burial 
 and your aunt's affairs.

529
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I supposed things were... jumbled.

530
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,600
We promised your husband 
 that we'd watch over you

531
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,120
on the voyage home.

532
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,640
That's very kind of you.

533
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,680
The Paradines have the most 
 beautiful estate on the Hudson,

534
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,240
and their little girl is a dream.

535
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,760
Miss Foley, could I have 
 the pleasure of a dance?

536
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,800
Oh, well, Lulu would love 
 to dance, Mr. Park,

537
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,840
as long as it isn't that 
 abominable turkey trot.

538
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,880
One wonders what the 
 world is coming to sometimes.

539
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
Posture, Lulu.

540
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,960
Such a charming man,

541
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
and so very handsome.

542
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,000
Our little Lulu could do worse.

543
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,040
Our little Lulu couldn't 
 do any better.

544
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,560
He's shrewd-- ha ha-- intelligent.

545
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
And loaded.

546
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,080
A marriage made in heaven.

547
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,640
You must long to dance, too 
 a young woman like you.

548
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,200
It's so sad you're stuck in 
 black for the whole crossing.

549
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
It doesn't domuch for your...

550
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,760
delicate complexion.

551
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,280
I suppose your aunt's 
 husband is grieving.

552
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,840
The marriage only lasted 
 a year, Mrs. Foley.

553
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,360
I don't know where 
 Mr. Santilese is now.

554
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,400
Why, she gave up everything 
 for that Scoundrel.

555
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,480
Well, what can you 
 expect? An italian.

556
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,000
He was after her 
 inheritance. I said so.

557
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,040
Poor woman.

558
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,560
On the contrary, Mrs. Foley.

559
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,600
My aunt had no regrets.

560
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,120
In fact, just before she died, 
 she told me it was a glorious year.

561
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,680
No matter what the price, 
 it was worth a lifetime.

562
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,280
Would you excuse me?

563
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,800
I have such a terrible headache.

564
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Oh, poor lady.

565
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,320
Let me help you to your room.

566
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,360
No, no, please. Please, 
 continue with your dinner.

567
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,480
Isabella, wait.

568
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,520
Go back to your dancing 
 partner, Mr. Park.

569
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,560
You're jealous.

570
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
You're jealous.

571
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,080
Now you know how I feel.

572
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,640
You can imagine what's been 
 happening to me all these years.

573
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,680
Eddie Paradine has everything 
 your family's ever wanted for you--

574
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
money and a pedigree.

575
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,240
He's a kind man,

576
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,280
a gentleman, a good husband.

577
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,800
Oh, your marriage must 
 have pleased your father

578
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
and your mother.

579
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,840
My parents are both dead now,

580
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,400
and the past is the past,

581
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,920
irretrievable.

582
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,440
It's been with me every 
 moment of every day.

583
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,480
Don't you think it's 
 been the same for me?

584
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, Bella.

585
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,560
Oh, Bella...

586
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,120
I'm married, Wynn.

587
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,160
I never expected to see you again.

588
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,680
You broke my heart.

589
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
What do you think of me brood?

590
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,680
Nice children.

591
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,680
Nice wife, too.

592
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,240
I wouldn't be much without 'em.

593
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,760
You planning to have pups yourself?

594
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,800
Ha! Me? No. No, no.

595
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,840
I wouldn't be so good at it,

596
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,360
uh, raising pups, I mean.

597
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,280
Damn!

598
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,840
"Crew only."

599
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
There has to be another way up.

600
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,920
I might as well be in prison.

601
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
What's out there, Mr. Boxhall?

602
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,880
Looks like a freighter.

603
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,920
Yes, sir.

604
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
The Rappahannock 
 on opposite course.

605
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
She's morseing us.

606
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,040
She's warning us of icebergs

607
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,040
and heavy ice pack ahead.

608
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,600
Where are the other Binoculars?

609
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,160
They only gave us one 
 pair for the bridge.

610
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Mr. Boxhall, I will not 
 have my officers

611
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,720
passing around one 
 bloody pair of glasses.

612
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
Now take the ones 
 from the crow's nest.

613
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,760
The lookouts won't like this.

614
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,800
I'm not concerned 
 with what they like.

615
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,320
They'll manage well enough

616
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,840
until we reach New York.

617
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,160
J.J., you sure you won't 
 join us for another hand?

618
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,200
No, no. 
 Nightcap and then to bed.

619
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,720
I promised my wife.

620
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
I forgot. You're a Newlywed.

621
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
What's the matter,

622
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,360
never seen a woman 
 smoke a cigar before?

623
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
Well, no.

624
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,880
I mean, not a lady, anyway.

625
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Not like you.

626
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,920
Well, get used to it.

627
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,440
Woman's emancipation.

628
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,960
We can smoke cigars.

629
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,480
We can tell you men 
 how to run the world.

630
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,520
Hell, we'll probably 
 have a woman president

631
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,560
in the next 100 years.

632
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Unfortunately,

633
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
I don't think I'll be 
 around to see that.

634
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,640
Well, I hope I won't.

635
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,160
Can I buy you another drink?

636
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,680
Some brew on me.

637
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,200
Whatever he's drinking.

638
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,240
I come into a bit 
 of money recently.

639
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,760
I'll share my good fortune.

640
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Well, thank you, young man.

641
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,800
You, uh, down in your cups?

642
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,320
You might say that.

643
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
I've remarried recently.

644
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,400
Hmm. Well, that'll do it.

645
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,920
Ha ha! No, no. 
 I'm happily married.

646
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,960
I'm only worried 
 about the reception

647
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,480
my new wife received 
 tonight in the dining room.

648
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
She's very young.

649
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
People can be cruel.

650
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,080
Yeah, well...

651
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
bunch of stiffs,

652
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
full of themselves 
 and all their money.

653
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,120
Mmm.

654
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,160
Some tugboat, eh?

655
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,200
Yes. It's a thing of beauty.

656
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,200
Have you been to America before?

657
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,240
No. No. Looking forward to it.

658
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,280
Yeah, I might go into 
 a bit of business.

659
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
You ever hear of this chap 
 called, um, Mack Sennett?

660
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,360
Got hisself a moving-picture company.

661
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,400
Calls it keystone.

662
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,920
Up-and-coming sort of thing.

663
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,920
Let me give you a bit of advice.

664
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,440
I always find investors 
 for my projects.

665
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,000
It's better to use another 
 fellow's money.

666
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,040
Yeah. Well said. 
 I can drink to that.

667
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,080
I believe in using the 
 other fellow's money, too.

668
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,600
Actually, I'm thinking 
 more about, um...

669
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,120
acting in the keystone company.

670
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,640
Might do a bit of shakespeare.

671
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,200
Well, I'm sure you'll 
 do well in America,

672
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,720
Whatever you decide at,

673
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,240
young fellow like yourself.

674
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,760
Yeah, well, nice to meet you.

675
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Oh!

676
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,800
Clumsy.

677
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,320
So sorry.

678
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
My wife will think I'm a sot.

679
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,360
I'll have this cleaned for you.

680
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
I've got connections 
 in the laundry.

681
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,400
Don't worry about it.

682
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Good evening to you,

683
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,440
and I will watch for you

684
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,480
in the moving pictures.

685
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,600
Another brandy, man,

686
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,160
and make it a double.

687
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Yes, sir.

688
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,800
[ moaning ]

689
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,120
[ baby crying ]

690
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,160
No!

691
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
No!

692
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,480
[ moaning ]

693
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Alice, wake up.

694
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
You're having a nightmare.

695
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,080
My baby.

696
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,600
He was dead in the water.

697
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,640
Dead.

698
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,160
It's only a dream, Alice.

699
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,200
You don't have a baby, Alice.

700
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,720
That's right, Lorraine. 
 Now go back to sleep.

701
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,760
Mummy's here, sweetness.

702
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,760
We don't want to 
 frighten the children,

703
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,800
now, do we?

704
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,840
The ice. There was 
 ice and a shipwreck,

705
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,840
and he was out there 
 in the freezing water.

706
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,880
Oh, dear, now. The baby.

707
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Alice, please.

708
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,440
Shh. There now, honey.

709
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Oh. Shh.

710
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,480
What is it?

711
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
A bad dream, appearently.

712
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,520
She's very...

713
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
nervous.

714
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,600
His night garment's on backwards.

715
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,680
We stop at Queenstown tomorrow.

716
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,200
I think it's best for all of us

717
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,760
if Alice gets off there, in Ireland.

718
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,440
My baby.

719
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,480
My poor little baby.

720
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
Are you lost, Mr. Dickie?

721
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,600
Oh... you.

722
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Look, I know I'm not 
 supposed to be up here,

723
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,640
but an acquaintance of mine 
 invited me up for a drink.

724
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,680
Oh, son, let me give you 
 a piece of advice.

725
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,240
Take it from your old da.

726
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
You're holding

727
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,280
Mr. John Jacob Astor's Billfold.

728
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,800
I saw you life it in the bar.

729
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
You didn't realize that, 
 now, did you, Mr. Dickie?

730
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,360
John Jacob Astor?

731
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,880
I don't know what 
 you're talking about.

732
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm trying to be 
 your friend here, son.

733
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,920
Everybody needs a friend.

734
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,960
I told you--

735
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,480
You put the bit on 
 the great man hisself.

736
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,040
I just want to keep you 
 out of trouble, that's all.

737
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,040
A nice young chap like you.

738
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,160
There's a good boy.

739
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,680
The best.

740
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,720
You don't want to get 
 caught on your first night out

741
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,240
stealing Billfolds,

742
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,280
especially one 
 belonging to Mr. Astor.

743
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
It's all there.

744
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,320
I'll tell him I found it 
 laying on the floor

745
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,360
by the bar.

746
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,880
Must have dropped it, eh?

747
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,400
You're not going to report me?

748
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Of course not.

749
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,440
I helped you before, didn't I?

750
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
The time to be picking Billfolds

751
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,080
is the last night out.

752
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,120
Men get all their moola 
 out of the safe.

753
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,160
Now, I'm sure we can 
 work out something

754
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,680
that'll be good for the both of us.

755
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,720
You're a talented lad, you are.

756
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
I could see that right away.

757
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,280
Quick and slick with 
 your hands, you are.

758
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,800
What's your name, son?

759
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,840
Your real name.

760
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,880
Well, it don't really 
 matter now, does it?

761
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,920
Don't be so prickly.

762
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,440
I can't help if I worry a bit

763
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,960
about the real Mr. Merriam Dickie.

764
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,000
You didn't ax the fellow, did you?

765
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
Of course not.

766
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,080
He passed out... drunk.

767
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
[ laughing ]

768
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,120
Drunk as a skunk, eh, Dickie?

769
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,160
I can see you and I

770
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,200
are going to get along really well.

771
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,320
[ laughing ]

772
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,920
All passengers 
 disembarking in Ireland

773
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,960
must proceed to the boat deck.

774
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
We have landed in Queenstown.

775
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,000
ALICE: Please, sir!

776
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,520
No! Don't make me go. 
 I beg you.

777
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,040
You've been fairly treated.

778
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,560
I've given you plenty of money

779
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,600
for your boat fare back to England.

780
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Oh, you're kind people,

781
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,640
you have to understand.

782
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,200
I'm just a young girl 
 alone in the world.

783
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,720
Please, Miss, you've upset my wife.

784
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,240
All this talk about your baby.

785
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,760
I couldn't help it.

786
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,320
See, I had a baby what died.

787
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,840
Your baby died?

788
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Where's your husband?

789
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,400
There's no husband, sir.

790
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,440
Anyway, he ran off.

791
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,480
I can't go back to England.

792
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,000
Don't cry. Here.

793
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,560
Will you promise to keep 
 these things to yourself?

794
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,600
It would only upset my wife.

795
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Yes, sir,

796
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
I promise.

797
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
It would also help

798
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,200
if you could get through 
 the children's supper

799
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,720
wihtout spilling soup.

800
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Well, I'm nervous,

801
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,760
but I'll do better now.

802
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,320
If I give you this chance,

803
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,840
you won't let me down?

804
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,360
My word, sir.

805
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,400
I give you my word.

806
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,440
And I thank you 
 for the opportunity

807
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,960
to stay on this ship.

808
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,480
I do, sir.

809
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,000
I thank my lucky stars.

810
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,160
Hello and goodbye to Ireland.

811
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,680
The emerald isle,

812
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,240
so green and beautiful.

813
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,280
Makes me wonder if I 
 should just stop here.

814
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,320
Close to home--

815
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,840
is that what you're thinking?

816
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,880
No. I try not to think of them--

817
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
my mother,

818
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,440
my little brother and sisters.

819
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,480
Their life is so hard.

820
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,000
I try to think of the future only,

821
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
like you.

822
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,560
No. No, not like me.

823
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,080
You don't want to be like me.

824
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,160
Anyway, you'll send for 
 your family someday.

825
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,680
Yes. How do you know that?

826
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
You don't know me.

827
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,240
Well, I know that you're good,

828
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,760
a good person.

829
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,800
Maybe the only good 
 person I've ever known.

830
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
[ morse code signal beeping ]

831
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,960
So, uh...

832
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,000
which is which, then, eh?

833
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,520
Oh. Green's where I've been.

834
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,560
Yellow's where I want to go.

835
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,600
Right. You know, uh, Phillips,

836
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,120
you're probably the only bloke

837
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,640
that took the ad seriously.

838
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,160
"Join the Marconi company 
 see the world."

839
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,680
Hey, well, here we are.

840
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,240
Yeah, like hell. See the world?

841
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
How are we suppose to 
 see the world, Phillips,

842
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,760
stuck in this bloody Brom closet?

843
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,800
Wynn Park. 
 I'm expecting a Marconi-Gram.

844
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Park.

845
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
There's so many messages 
 coming and going.

846
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
There we are.

847
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,400
There you are, sir.

848
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,960
I'll be expecting several others.

849
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,960
I'd like them delivered immediately.

850
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,000
Right, sir.

851
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
Smooth sailing all the way.

852
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,520
I hope so.

853
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,080
Hoo.

854
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,600
Cheers, governor.

855
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
It's a double eagle.

856
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,640
It's a $20 piece.

857
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,160
Look at that.

858
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,680
Tin mines.

859
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,200
Didn't that wire say tin mines?

860
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Uh-huh. You split that with me?

861
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,240
Right.

862
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
- Ahh. 
 - Oh-ho-ho.

863
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Hey?

864
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,600
"Please forgive me. I was a bore."

865
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Oh, Wynn.

866
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,800
A red dress?

867
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,360
Do you see that, a red dress?

868
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,880
It can't be. She's in mourning.

869
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,440
She appears to have recovered.

870
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Pomme Duchesse.

871
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,480
Where I come from,

872
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,000
we call a spud a spud.

873
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,520
she's not sittng here. 
 I won't have it.

874
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,560
This is a disgrace.

875
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Hazel.

876
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
It's only been a few months

877
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,080
since her Aunt Grace passed away.

878
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,640
She ought to show some respect,

879
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,680
even though her aunt was... fast.

880
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,200
Mrs. Paradine.

881
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
You feeling better?

882
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,240
I am, Mr. Ismay, thank you.

883
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,280
I feel queasy.

884
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Mr. Park?

885
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,320
Oh, he had urgent business.

886
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,360
I understand the 
 Bolivian government

887
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,880
has given him permission 
 to open some tin mines.

888
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,920
That's dangerous.

889
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,440
That-- that Zapata fellow.

890
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,960
That's Mexico, my dear.

891
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,480
It's the same thing.

892
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,520
Oh, here he is.

893
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,520
I knew he wouldn't disappoint us.

894
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,560
Evening. I'm sorry I'm late.

895
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,120
So, it's mining, is it?

896
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,640
Takes perseverance.

897
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,160
Me and my man, we never 
 gave up when others did.

898
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,200
Our little Johnny mine 
 turned out to be

899
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,720
the richest gold vein in the world.

900
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,240
Of course, it didn't 
 exactly buy us happiness.

901
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,320
Well, money doesn't always 
 get us what we want.

902
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,840
You unlucky in love, Mr. Park?

903
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,880
My family tree is missing 
 a few branches.

904
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,400
I set out to prove to 
 a young lady's parents

905
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,920
that I was worthy of her,

906
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,480
and she married someone else.

907
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,040
Mr. Park, you could have 
 any woman in the world.

908
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,560
Except the one I want.

909
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,080
You'll be going there, 
 Mr. Park, to Bolivia?

910
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,640
Yes.

911
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,160
As soon as we land in New York.

912
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Oh, you can come to 
 our Lulu's birthday party.

913
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,200
I mean, one little week.

914
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
The Bolivian government can wait.

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
Mrs. Paradine.

917
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,840
Will you tango?

918
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,400
I thought you'd never ask, Mr. Park.

919
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,920
My dear...

920
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
are you forgetting?

921
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
You are in mourning.

922
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,480
I've mourned enough.

923
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,640
Oh, my. I feel absolutely faint.

924
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,680
Dancing the tango?

925
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,240
We haven't even finished 
 the first course.

926
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,760
They're just skipping to dessert.

927
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,280

931
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,440
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

932
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Excuse me, I thought Mr. Par--

933
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,480
Oh, I believe he went up 
 for an early breakfast.

934
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,520
Mrs. Paradine, I have 
 wonderful news for you.

935
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,560
I have managed to convince 
 the Countess of Rothes

936
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,600
that she absolutely must 
 take this stateroom.

937
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,600
Her servants have 
 packed all her things,

938
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,160
so, here I am ready to move you.

939
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,160
Move me?

940
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,200
Well, you weren't happy in this suite,

941
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,240
and it's my job to make you happy.

942
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,760
Ah, yes, well, 
 that won't be necessary.

943
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,800
I'm quite happy here now.

944
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,320
Yes, but I've arranged for it.

945
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,320
The Countess of Rothes--

946
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,880
it took a great deal of maneuvering.

947
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,400
I-- I've changed my mind.

948
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,920
I'm completely comfortable here. 
 Thank you.

949
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,480
Yes, but what do I tell 
 the Countess of Rothes?

950
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,640
MAN: Very smooth.

951
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,720
I slept like a baby last night.

952
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
Excuse me.

953
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,840
Bad news, Captain?

954
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,880
Um, no, Mr. Strauss,

955
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,920
just, uh...

956
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Routine.

957
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,480
You and Mrs. Strauss 
 enjoy your breakfast.

958
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,040
CAPTAIN: Mr. Ismay.

959
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,560
Ah, yes, what is it?

960
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,600
A message from the ship Baltic

961
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,120
regarding ice conditions.

962
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,200
I'm told that you've been 
 discussing operation of the ship

963
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,240
with my crew.

964
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,760
Yes, with regard to our speed.

965
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,800
It's certainly within my 
 prepogative as chairman.

966
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,840
Things are running smoothly--

967
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,840
the machinery is bearing the test,

968
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,360
the boilers are running well.

969
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,880
The ship is steady,

970
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,920
and with power to spare.

971
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,440
We can beat the olympic's record

972
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,960
and be in New York on Tuesday.

973
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,520
I see absolutely no purpose 
 in arriving a day early.

974
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,040
Yes, and I see no 
 purpose in meandering,

975
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,080
keeping to a schedule 
 devised for inferior vessels.

976
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,120
But there are basic...

977
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,120
safety procedures nonetheless.

978
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,200
I want this ship to perform 
 to its full potential.

979
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,200
Well...

980
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,280
in future, if there's any discussion 
 about the operation of this ship,

981
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,320
it must be cleared with me first.

982
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,840
This may be my last crossing...

983
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,360
but I am still the captain.

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,960

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,040

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Good morning.

987
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,080
You couldn't sleep?

988
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,120
No.

989
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,120
Me, neither.

990
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,200
And I was up thinking about you--

992
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,760
and your daughter...

993
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Claire.

994
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,280
She's such a tomboy.

995
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,320
Hates fancy clothers.

996
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,880
She's very bright, curious.

997
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,920
She loves dogs.

998
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,000
She loves horses. She rides 
 for hours with her father.

999
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,080
What are we going to do?

1000
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,600
All those years I've 
 wondered about you--

1001
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,160
where you were and 
 what you were doing.

1002
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,680
And now you're here.

1003
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,200
With you.

1004
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,720
For 4 days.

Osa, what you going 
 to do in America?

00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,120
I'm going to Minnesota 
 with the other converts

1010
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,160
to build a new life.

1011
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,720
Oh, I want to do good in 
 this world, Mr. Dickie.

1012
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,240
Do good?

1013
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
I want to be a teacher or a nurse,

1014
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,760
have children of my own.

1015
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,280
And raise them to be good souls

1016
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,320
and to help their fellow man,

1017
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,840
like Mrs. Jack teaches her children.

1018
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,400
Oh, the Jacks have been so kind to me.

1019

Yeah.

You have a dream. 
 I can see it in your eyes.

I do have a dream.

 of those moving pictures?

1026

Moving pictures?

1027
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,160
Yeah. I saw one at a 
 carnival peep show once.

1028
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,200
I put my eye to the hole in the box,

1029
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,240
and there was people in there--

1030
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,240

1031
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,800
Oh, I mean, they wasn't 
 really in there,

1032
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,320
but it was like they was.

1033
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,880
There was this beauty,

1037

No, no, not her.

1038
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,040
I mean, my dream is 
 to be a part of it,

1039
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,560
part of the moving pictures.

1040
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,600
Well...

1041
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,120
then you must work for 
 it and make it happen.

1042
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,640
No, stupid pipe dream.

1043
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,200
Anyway...

1044
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,200
you could be in 
 the moving pictures.

1045
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,760
I mean, you're-- you're much 
 prettier than Mary Pickford.

1046
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,320
Well...

00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,400
but I'm not looking 
 for pictures in a box.

00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,920
What you looking for?

1050
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920

1052

 the dawn of a new age.

The fires below are sending

1055
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,640

1056
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,680
Who knows what kind of progress

1057
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,680
we'll see in the next 100 years?

1058
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,760
Soon we'll be flying across 
 the Atlantic in airplanes.

1059
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,760
But nothing will ever 
 be like this again--

1060
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,320
Nothing like the Titanic,

1061
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,360
a boat this big and powerful...

1062
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,880
and so beautiful.

1063
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
There's a rumor we'll be 
 landing a day early.

1064
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,920
Only rumors.

1065
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,440
Captain Smith...

1066
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,960
could we bribe you

1067
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,480
to take your time,

1068
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,000
to meander off course a little?

1069
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,520
I know what you mean.

1070
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,560
I suppose I will miss all of this.

1071
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,080
There's a magic to it.

1072
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,600
I enjoy it most right here

1073
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,160
behind the wheel.

1074
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,160
It's almost sacred.

1075
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,200
May I steer it?

1076
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,840
Oh, you're right.

1077
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,400
It is magical.

1078
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,920
I can feel the power 
 beneath my feet.

1079

01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,560
I wouldn't mind a 
 piece of her myself.

1437
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,080
You want to get 
 smashed in the face?

1438
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,120
You do, and you'll end up 
 in the ship's brig,

1439
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,160
you silly bugger.

1440
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,680
Now... I'm having a jar

1441
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,720
with the purser in his office.

1442
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,760
Perfect time for you to life 
 the key out of his pocket.

1443
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,800
Magic hands like yours...

1444
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,320
no problem.

1445
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,360
Understand?

1446
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,360
All right!

1447
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,400
You just stay away from her.

1448
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,920
You hear me?

1449
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,480
She's too good for the likes of you.

1450
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,480
[ snickering ]

1451
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And me.

1452
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,600
[ bell clangs 4 times ]

1453
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,640
4 bells.

1454
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,640
10:00.

1455
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,680
Ocean's as smooth as a mill pond.

1456
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,200
Water's like oil.

1457
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,240
I was saying the same 
 to the captain.

1458
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,800
He left word to be called 
 if conditions become doubtful.

1459
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,800
Good night, Mr. Murdock.

1460
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,840
Yes. Right.

1461
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,840
Good night, Mr. Lightoller.

1462
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,520
It's cold out tonight.

1463
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,560
Aye. By the smell of it, 
 there's ice about.

1464
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,600
You smell it before you get to it.

1465
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,160
Of course, I wouldn't 
 tell the Bigwigs that.

1466
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,680
They think you're stupid.

1467
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,200
But you know what I say.

1468
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,240
We're the eyes of this here ship.

1469
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,240
Well, don't expect no respect.

1470
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,800
What I expect is 
 some proper glasses.

1471
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,320
I've got good eyesight,

1472
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,360
but I can't see in the dark.

1473
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,880
Well, I asked again just tonight.

1474
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,400
They would like to 
 have bit me head off.

1475
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,960
I'm through with the bloomin' sea.

1476
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,480
After this one, I'll go back home,

1477
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,000
make an honest woman of me Linda.

1478
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,080
There's a ship.

1479
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,640
Off the southeast.

1480
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,240
That looks like a big passenger liner,

1481
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,760
maybe 10 miles away.

1482
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,800
No. 
 She's something like ourselves--

1483
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,320
a small freighter.

1484
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,360
Not that far.

1485
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,880
Any other ships in the vicinity?

1486
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,440
The closest one's the, uh, Titanic.

1487
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,960
Can't be the Titanic.

1488
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,480
She's closer to us in size.

1489
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
That must be a freighter...

1490
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,520
or a fishing boat.

1491
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,040
Maybe.

1492
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,560
Have evans radio the Titanic.

1493
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,120
Tell them we've stopped 
 for the night...

1494
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,640
surrounded by ice.

1495
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,640
Yes, sir.

1496
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,280
Phillips.

1497
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,840
I'll never get through all these.

1498
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,840
Yes, ma'am?

1499
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,840
I wish to send a wire.

1500
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,880
Right, then.

1501
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,880
Address at the top.

1502
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,000
My husband is at 
 our home on the Hudson.

1503
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,560
This has to go out immediately.

1504
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,560
Do you understand?

1505
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,560
Yes, ma'am. The thing of it is--

1506
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,080
We're bogged down here right now.

1507
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,600
The wireless broke down last night

1508
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,640
and wasn't back in commission 
 until 5:00 this morning.

1509
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,680
We've got quite a backlog, ma'am.

1510
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,200
Please. This has to 
 go out immediately.

1511
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,240
You have to send it 
 right away before I...

1512
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,280
Before, ma'am?

1513
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,320
Before I lose my strength.

1514
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,400
Before I change my mind.

1515
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,520
Please, just send it.

1516
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,080
Well, uh, don't worry, ma'am.

1517
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,120
It's very urgent.

1518
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,640
Promise me.

1519
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,680
We'll do the best we can, eh?

1520

1521
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,320

 to get the shock of his life.

[ incoming telegraph ]

1523
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,920
Shut up.

1524
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,920
Shut up. You're jamming me.

1525
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,960
Damn freighter Californian.

1526
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,000
Stopped for the night 
 on account of ice.

1527
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,040
They keep interrupting.

1528
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,560
Bloody Titanic wants me to shut up?

1529
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,600
Well, the same to you, Bucko.

1530
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,160
I can't get 
 Mrs. Paradine's message out.

1531
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,160
Poor lady.

1532
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,800
Can I offer you a fag, chief?

1533
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,320
Aye, thanks, Jack.

1534
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,880
It's me prize. 
 Tobaccy from the East Indies.

Ow. That hurt.

Are there really angels, Mama?

1539
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,560
Of course there are angels...

 sister and your brothers.

01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,680
And over this ship to 
 make sure we're safe.

Ohh, you're a mass of snarls, 
 Miss Ophelia Jack.

1544
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,800
You need one of them angels 
 down here to brush it out.

What- what? No! What are you--

Your boyfriend's not around 
 to protect you, right?

01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,440

Aah!

1567
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,040
You're a piece, you are.

1568
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,080
I had my eye on you from the start.

1569
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,120
Let me go! Let me go!

1570
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,160
You're going nowhere.

1571
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,720
I knew from the first 
 time I laid eyes on you

1572
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,240
that you were no saint.

1573

01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,640
What are we doing? 
 It's not a race.

1575
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,160
We have our orders, Mr. Boxhall.

1576
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,760
Hope Mr. Astor won't be 
 playing cards too late.

1577
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,280
I hate to go to bed alone.

1578
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,800
I put a nice warm bottle 
 under the covers, ma'am.

1579
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,840
It'll be very comfy.

1580
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,880
Finished?

1581
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,880
Mm-hmm.

1582
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,440
I was talking to the Allisons' nanny.

1583
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,480
Such a strange bird, she is.

1584
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,000
I've been racking my brain 
 trying to remember

1585

where I know here from.

1586
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,040
Her name is Alice.

1587
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,600
That's what the little girl said.

1589
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,240
Oh, Mrs. Astor, I must 
 go get your husband.

Alice Cleaver, that's who she is.

1592
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,800
What are you talking about?

1593
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,840
Um, nothing. 
 Nothing that concerns you.

1594
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,360
Who is Alice Cleaver?

1595
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,360
Not in your condition. 
 I'll speak with Mr. Astor.

1596
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,400
He'll know what's do be done.

1597
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,640
You boys keep playing like this,

1598
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,640

01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,800
You must excuse me 
 for just a moment.

1602
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,800
We'll wait.

1603
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,360
He's the one with the money.

1604
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,360
Is something wrong with my wife?

1605
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,880
Oh, no, no. She's safe in bed.

1606
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,920
Well, what is it, then?

1607
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,960
You must go have a word 
 with Mr. Allison, sir.

1608
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,960
You must warn him.

1609

01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,560
She was convicted about 3 years ago

1613
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,080
for... for murdering her baby.

1614
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,600
Where did you hear all this rubbish?

1615
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,640
It was in the paper.

1616
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:56,640
They let her out of prison.

1617
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,160
Said she was deranged at the time

1618
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,200
on account of the baby's 
 father deserting her.

1619
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,200
They granted her leniency,

1620
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,760
which is no excuse if you ask me. 
 Her little child--

1621
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,800
It's after 11:00. 
 I can't go wake them up now.

1622
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,840
But she's in charge of 
 the Allison children, sir,

1623
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,360
and she's a murderer.

1624
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,880
Perhaps you're mistaken.

1625
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,920
At any rate, 
 nothing will happen tonight.

1626
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,920
I will talk with 
 Mr. Allison in the morning.

1627
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,960
I'm sure he won't mind 
 your waking him up

1629
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,520
In the morning, Miss Miller.

I will speak with 
 Mr. Allison in the morning.

1631

But she--

she threw him from a train.

Yes. What do you see?

Ice! Dead ahead!

Impossible.

 We hit an iceberg.
