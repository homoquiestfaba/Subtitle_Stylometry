00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,270
(MAN'S VOICE) <i>You want to know</i>
<i>all about me, don't you?</i>

2
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,753
<i>Well, let's see, now...</i>

3
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,029
<i>The first time I was in love</i>
<i>was June 1975, in Boca Raton.</i>

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,758
<i>Her name was Coty Pierce.</i>

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,195
<i>She lived there with her parents</i>
<i>and her little sister, Karrie.</i>

6
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,912
<i>And I loved her, too. I loved them both,</i>
<i>and they were in love with me.</i>

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,190
<i>They just didn't know it.</i>
<i>No one did.</i>

8
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,914
<i>I lived with them all that June.</i>

9
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,275
(WOMAN) <i>I don't understand.</i>

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,956
(MAN'S VOICE RESUMES)
<i>I lived in the attic. I was watching.</i>

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,749
<i>I loved the expression on their faces</i>
<i>when they slept.</i>

12
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,792
<i>And then I decided to declare myself</i>

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,315
<i>and show them</i>
<i>how much they loved me.</i>

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,472
- <i>What happened?</i>
- <i>What happened?</i>

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,758
<i>Coty was honoured.</i>

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,390
<i>She kissed me back.</i>
<i>And then Karrie...</i>

17
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,638
<i>And finally that night,</i>

18
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,598
<i>I kissed their mother, too.</i>

19
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,197
<i>Just a little pinprick. There.</i>

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,551
<i>Kiss me.</i>

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,032
That's it. Are you watching this?

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,114
Good. Stand back!

23
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,669
This game is 80% winning and
20% talent. You've got to keep running.

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,479
That's it, that's my boy.

25
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,757
Good. Bring an uppercut.
Right hand.

26
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,037
Don't fall on your face
because you missed that jab.

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,716
What do I always say? Power comes
from leverage and technique.

28
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,916
Are you paying attention?

29
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,752
(BEEPER)

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,958
I've got to go. Pair off and hit
the heavy bag. Three rounds each.

31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,229
How long has she been inside?
I'm on my way.

32
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,592
Their names are Edmund and Dianne
Wainford, ages 48 and 42.

33
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,320
An item about seven years,
no complaints.

34
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,756
The neighbours say they were
divorced, married, separated,

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,311
reconciled, his idea, her idea,
no one has a clue.

36
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,716
All I know is that's Edmund,
and Dianne's in the bedroom.

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,030
Whose gun?

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,272
He had a.38
Smith and Wesson registered.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,992
Does that look like a.38 to you?

40
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,073
Do you want a vest?

41
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,792
I don't think I'll need one.

42
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,832
Dianne?

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,154
This is Alex Cross, DCPD.
I need to talk to you. OK?

44
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,912
Dianne, I'm going
to open the door, all right?

45
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,873
I'm going to open it now.

46
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,033
Hold it.

47
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,879
Please. Please, Dianne.

48
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,632
I'm going to close this door.

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,679
I'm going to move this chair
to block the door.

50
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,233
That way nobody comes in and
this stays between me and you. OK?

51
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,392
Can you take the gun
out of your mouth, please?

52
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,235
It's just as effective
if you put it to your temple.

53
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,312
It just makes it easier to talk.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,710
- What sort of policeman are you?
- I'm a forensic psychologist.

55
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:50,035
I'm a guy who walks into a room
and determines the hows and whys.

56
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,670
- Then you don't need to hear from me.
- No, I don't.

57
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,673
But I need you
to confirm a couple of things.

58
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,072
For instance, did Edmond
often beat you after he drank?

59
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,313
And the turtleneck you're wearing,
is that to hide bruises?

60
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,790
Do you often have to hide marks
that he put on you?

61
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,953
Two weeks ago, he hit me.

62
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,912
And I swore it was the last time.

63
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,271
I finally get the nerve
to leave that son of a bitch

64
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,034
and then he suckers me back.

65
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,478
You know what I think?
That you did what you had to do.

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,153
The thing now
is to figure out how to finish things off.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,756
The right way! The right way!

68
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,708
Is it all right if I come a little closer?

69
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,155
Thanks.

70
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,790
We only have
to get photographs of your bruises.

71
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,236
I know at least
half a dozen top notch lawyers

72
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,949
that specialise
in battered women's defences.

73
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,349
The point is, Dianne,

74
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,798
if you pull the trigger,
no one will ever know the truth.

75
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,679
Can I have it?

76
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,671
Dianne?

77
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,076
Samp, what are you doing here?
Doughnut raid?

78
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,754
Alex... hold on.

79
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,673
- Look, May's inside.
- Yeah?

80
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,276
- We got a call from Durham today.
- Durham?

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,993
- Naomi is missing. Come on.
- What do you mean, "missing"?

82
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,188
They called May from the law school.
She called me. I called them back.

83
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,113
I told them who you were, her uncle.

84
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,919
They said she's been missing
for four days.

85
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,596
- Four days!
- The Durham Police is on it now.

86
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,753
- The guy I talked to sounded solid.
- Don't talk to him, talk to me.

87
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,074
- They stole my child!
- Now, May, take it easy.

88
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,189
We'll handle it together, but with your
high blood pressure, I need you to relax.

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,477
- But what if?
- Now, you just take it easy.

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,871
Relax and breathe.
I want to tell you something.

91
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,874
Remember when Naomi
was about ten, she got lost?

92
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,715
You got frantic because you thought
we'd never find her.

93
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,475
You were worried
she'd have an asthma attack.

94
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,029
It turned out she was just fine.

95
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,034
Well, everything will be fine now,
because I'll handle this myself.

96
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,317
You know you can trust me.
I'll handle this.

97
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,311
I trust you.

98
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,234
Nana is going to take you up to
Janell's room. Just relax for a while.

99
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,757
- I don't need to relax.
- May... May...

100
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,558
Yeah.

101
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,312
Good. All right.

102
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,315
- I'll have to go down there.
- Listen, Alex. Stay here.

103
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,077
If they've a chance to wrap it up, how
long will they hunt for one lost black girl?

104
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,598
Stay here. I'll go down there. You can't
do anything, it's out of yourjurisdiction.

105
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,116
You don't understand. I've got to go.

106
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,429
Please, talk to me.

107
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,998
Talk to me the way you used to.
Please, say something.

108
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,392
Please! I'm sorry.

109
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,355
I can be better. I can be good.

110
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,074
- I won't be bad any more.
- Yeah?

111
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,912
Yeah.

112
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,555
Please, I swear.

113
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,429
- You promise?
- Yes. I'll make you happy.

114
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,352
How?

115
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,553
Let me show you.

116
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,234
Tell me you love me.

117
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,158
Tell me you love me!

118
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,998
- I love you.
- Megan, I don't believe you.

119
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,630
- I love you.
- Of course you do.

120
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,953
Good afternoon, Sergeant.
Dr Alex Cross, Washington DC PD.

121
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,999
- I would like to see Chief Hatfield.
- He's tied up at the moment.

122
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,598
We'll tell him. He'll be with you
as soon as possible. Take a load off.

123
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,835
Thank you.

124
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,437
- Sign this, sir.
- Dr Cross.

125
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,637
- You've been waiting for a while.
- About two hours.

126
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,156
- We've got a laid-back way here.
- I see.

127
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,189
- Run the names through the print-out.
- I'm sorry about the wait.

128
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,954
Nick Ruskin.

129
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,518
Davey Sikes.

130
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,989
It's been real busy round here.

131
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,199
We've had a homicide,
and not your garden variety, either.

132
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,399
- Meaning?
- That's all I know.

133
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,838
We are heading out there now.
You can ride with us if you like.

134
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,715
The board shows eight women missing.
How closely connected are they?

135
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,431
They all share the same profile.
Young, late teens, early 20s,

136
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,037
pretty, all from inside
the Research Triangle.

137
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,115
Each of them was ambushed.
No witnesses. Does his homework.

138
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,113
He ties them naked to a tree
and cuts their hair.

139
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,353
Only two bodies have been found.
This will probably be the third.

140
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,150
And the killer left a note for us
at the second murder scene.

141
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,440
- Signed it "Casanova".
- Casanova... The great lover.

142
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,869
This one here,
is she white, black or?

143
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,273
All we know is that she's
a young woman who didn't die happy.

144
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,355
Our Chief Hatfield
will be up at the scene.

145
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,513
I bet you two will get along
like pigs in a blanket.

146
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,074
It's not her.

147
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,997
- Dr Cross. My boss, Chief Hatfield.
- Chief.

148
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,554
Is it Detective Cross, Doctor Cross
or Doctor Detective Cross?

149
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,393
At a time like this, it doesn't matter.

150
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,518
As you see, it's not your niece.
I'm happy for you.

151
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,879
- Have you figured out who she is?
- Megan Murphy. University sophomore.

152
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,353
I told your Captain Hathaway I would
help, given your special situation.

153
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,273
- I appreciate that.
- Consider yourself my guest.

154
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,036
Make yourself at home...
but don't mess around in the kitchen.

155
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,919
Do you understand me?

156
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,879
The TV news crews can't be far off
if the crime author has arrived.

157
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,113
- Kyle, it's good to see you.
- You too.

158
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,795
- I thought you were in Rochester.
- Well, things change.

159
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,114
- I see you're making friends fast.
- I've done my best.

160
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,397
I heard about your niece. I'm sorry.

161
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,117
How long has this been
on the Bureau's wish list?

162
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,396
A while.

163
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:44,275
- Were the others tied up that way?
- Yes. He doesn't like square knots.

164
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,592
- He used Stayton Cordage, 7 gauge.
- Yeah, America's favourite.

165
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,150
- And the rest was too prolific to trace.
- The guy's a pro.

166
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,348
A real student of the game,
and an enthusiastic rapist.

167
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,594
The first post-mortems indicate vaginal
tears inflicted hours before death.

168
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,752
Then, that's it.
No prints, fibres, semen or hair.

169
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,792
Except what he cut off her.
What about the cause of death?

170
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,599
No signs of torture,
weight loss or drugging.

171
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,514
He just ties them up
and leaves them for the critters.

172
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,196
- Real student of the game...
- And he likes to play.

173
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,875
We've liaisoned
with the campus police, posted flyers...

174
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,032
Figured somebody must have
seen something important.

175
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,990
An environment fit for blending.
For you, a security nightmare.

176
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,550
For him... paradise.

177
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,198
We're going to get this animal.

178
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,035
We've got an eight-year-old girl
thrown from a motorcycle.

179
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,270
She'll get a CAT scan.

180
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,194
- What was she doing on a motorcycle?
- Her daddy took her for a ride.

181
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,591
The bandage is about to blow.
We'll have a bleed-out.

182
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,433
- I need a tourniquet.
- Retractors are ready.

183
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,513
I'll do a cut-down.
Scalpel, please, nurse.

184
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,598
Gauze and suture.

185
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,399
- What's her name?
- Laura.

186
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,712
It's an awful lot of blood
for such a little girl, Laura.

187
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,553
I'll try to put you back together again.

188
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,235
- Hi, Mrs Lee. I'm Dr McTiernan.
- Hello.

189
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,391
She's alive.

190
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,318
Mrs Lee, wait...

191
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,596
Mrs Lee, listen.

192
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,310
Laura has suffered severe head
trauma and she's in a coma.

193
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,239
(SHE TRANSLATES)

194
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,799
You can be with her as soon as...

195
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,792
Please let me see my baby!

196
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,992
I want to see the jab!
Now move around the ring.

197
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,835
Around the ring, let's go!
Don't stay there, back up.

198
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,514
Watch your contact.

199
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,232
Barry off, you can stay on.
Who's next?

200
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,838
- Kate, let's go.
- OK.

201
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,708
Go get him.
All right, let's keep it light, guys.

202
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,520
Come on, Kate, let's see something.

203
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,831
I want to see the jab.
There you go, good!

204
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,195
Let me see the jab.

205
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,594
Come on, on your toes.

206
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,876
- Come on, girl!
- Nice!

207
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,878
Good, let's go work it!
Come on, on your toes!

208
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,515
Ethan, what are you doing?
Watch your contact.

209
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,114
Kate, are you OK?

210
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,435
<i>This is a sorry substitute for sex.</i>

211
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,279
- I said, this is a sorry substitute...
- I heard you.

212
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,829
Yeah, OK...

213
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,671
Do you know what I'm looking for?

214
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,515
- The way my daddy looked at my mother.
- What way?

215
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,750
I can't settle for anything less.

216
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,151
- Sure picks lookers, doesn't he?
- Yeah, he does.

217
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,232
These women are more
than just attractive.

218
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,269
They are all extraordinary
in some way. Smart, talented...

219
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,238
He ain't choosing them
just for their congeniality.

220
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,552
Ordinarily, they don't. But I think
our guy is a little different.

221
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,235
- How so?
- Killing is not his ulterior motive.

222
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,233
This guy's a collector.
I bet these women are alive.

223
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,472
Come on. Our boy's brain is as soft
as a two-minute egg.

224
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,553
I think every one of them is tied
to a tree, waiting to be found.

225
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,271
Think about it, Sikes. The three you
found were killed out of sequence.

226
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,318
- They weren't the first abducted.
- That's right.

227
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,994
That don't mean
that they're not still out there.

228
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,199
You would have found them by now.
He makes no attempt to hide them.

229
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,158
And the way they were killed
is very revealing.

230
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,790
- That last walk through the woods.
- Marching to their fate.

231
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,236
Exactly. The rape,
cutting off their hair...

232
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,437
- It's punishment.
- Maybe for violating some trust.

233
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,990
What goddamn trust?

234
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,714
I don't know, Chief.

235
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,114
I don't know...

236
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,875
- How would you like to pay?
- I'm interested in another book.

237
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,749
It's a picture book for children
in the hospital. It's about being brave.

238
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,836
It sounds like a book by Burke.
I'll see if we have it in stock.

239
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,948
Good night, fish.

240
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,031
(SLIGHT SOUND)

241
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,913
(CREAKING)

242
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,877
(QUIET THUD)

243
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,632
- What do you want from me?
- Everything.

244
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,988
Take it back. Jump up, come on!

245
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,913
Come on, show me!

246
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,677
What are you doing?
Get the ball. It's my court.

247
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,034
Don't ever come back here again.

248
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,191
Get out of here. It's my court!

249
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,840
Seth Samuel?

250
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,992
I'm Dr Alex Cross.

251
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,398
- Naomi's uncle.
- And a cop.

252
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,393
- I don't recall inviting you, so...
- Can we talk?

253
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,438
Like I said, I don't recall
inviting you here.

254
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,316
Look, we can talk anywhere you want.

255
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,558
- I've told you guys everything I know.
- Which was nothing.

256
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,840
I've had cops on me for days.
Hauling me to the station at night,

257
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,913
all up my ass about Naomi
and things that are nobody's business.

258
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,073
Looks like your business
is in the public domain, doesn't it?

259
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,072
What do you want to know?

260
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,357
I want to know about Naomi's violin.

261
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,911
It's not on the police inventory.
Is it here?

262
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,471
She used to practise here.
She was always practising on the thing.

263
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,235
But she always
took it home with her. Always.

264
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,428
Yeah, I know.

265
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,669
The cops have no idea, do they?

266
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,837
Not a clue.

267
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,634
(MAN) I got all the glass out.

268
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,556
Everything you'll need to change
the dressing is right next to you.

269
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,598
I brought some of your clothes, too.

270
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,991
Something for every occasion.

271
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,758
- Can you hear me?
- Systemic analgesic.

272
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,471
- What did you give me?
- That's why I picked you, Kate.

273
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,038
Your intelligence.

274
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,595
I appreciate that.
I know most men don't. Can't.

275
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,797
I'm different. You'll see that in time.

276
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,232
Now try not to go back to sleep.

277
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,035
Oh, my God!

278
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,709
- Oh, my God!
- I need to tell you the rules. Stop.

279
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,954
- Why am I here?
- You are here... to fall in love.

280
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,793
To experience love.

281
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,475
But now I need you to listen carefully
and take what I say very seriously.

282
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,517
All right?

283
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,069
Don't try to escape.

284
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,959
Don't cry out for help.

285
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,109
And do not try
any of your kickboxing tricks.

286
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,673
Do you understand?

287
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,277
I'll do what I can to help you not break
these rules, but if you do, Kate,

288
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,193
you will really disappoint me.

289
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,911
That's it. There.

290
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,834
See? It didn't hurt, did it?

291
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,309
Don't worry.

292
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,393
You are with Casanova.

293
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,231
- <i>Yes?</i>
- I thought you'd be out... busy.

294
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,789
<i>Well, you were wrong.</i>

295
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,519
You've got mail.

296
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,399
- Do you like it?
- <i>Nice.</i>

297
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,879
<i>Exceptional. Really.</i>

298
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,878
I think she's extra special.

299
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,437
How are you feeling, old man?

300
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,558
Swimmers, make your mark!

301
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,758
Come on, keep going!
Move those bodies, let's go!

302
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,071
Kick it up, move it, move it!
Speed, speed, muscle!

303
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,279
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr Wick Sachs.

304
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,271
Lane five. He's destroying my varsity.

305
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,679
Thank you.

306
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,274
Let's go, Blondie, pick it up!

307
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,671
I can't tell you much
you don't already know.

308
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,834
I gave Naomi some academic
guidance, which she disregarded.

309
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,798
And that was that. Excuse me.

310
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,390
I don't have time
to get to know patients,

311
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,033
but I do know that Naomi was a special
woman. My heart goes out to you.

312
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,479
Word is that you make time to get
to know some of your special patients.

313
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,033
Whatever you may have heard, I don't
have time to kidnap and mutilate them.

314
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,999
I understand how you must feel,

315
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,952
you being a psychologist,
and a policeman and her uncle.

316
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,668
It must be like suffering
the tortures of the damned.

317
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,913
- For me or for her?
- Well, both.

318
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,673
(BEEPER)

319
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,796
It's yours.

320
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,355
He's never made strikes
this close together before, has he?

321
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,069
An intern, huh?

322
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,194
Yeah. He had a vacancy.

323
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,795
Never call out.

324
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,834
Never call out.

325
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,991
Never call out.

326
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,474
Somebody help me!

327
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,954
My name is Kate! I'm Kate McTiernan.

328
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,399
I'm a doctor at the Carolina
Regional Medical Center. I need help!

329
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,920
I know you can hear me!

330
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,278
Come on! Who's out there?

331
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,794
Somebody help...

332
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,556
My name is Kate McTiernan.
Somebody talk to me!

333
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,792
- Who is out there?
- <i>Be quiet.</i>

334
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,758
<i>Be quiet or he'll kill you.</i>

335
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,711
Oh, my God!

336
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,114
What's your name?

337
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,039
What's your name?
Talk to me, please, please!

338
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,714
Tell me your name.

339
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,474
<i>I'm Mary Jane Capaldi.</i>

340
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,390
It's good to hear your voice,
Mary Jane.

341
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,196
Are you OK?

342
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,397
<i>I'm Kristen Miles. I'm here, too.</i>

343
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,597
<i>I'm Melissa Stanfield.</i>
<i>I don't know how long I've been here.</i>

344
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,910
<i>What month is it?</i>

345
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,870
- <i>I'm Samantha Gaines.</i>
- <i>Carol Akers.</i>

346
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,998
My name is Naomi Cross.

347
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,392
I've been here for eight days, I think.

348
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,312
Yeah, I know. I miss you too, darling.

349
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,632
You know I do.

350
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,268
How's May?

351
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,512
That's good. Stay with her, you hear?

352
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,153
Hang on, Janell. Just a second.

353
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,236
I'm sorry.

354
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,273
"Odalisques were the most valuable
of the Emperor's treasures,

355
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,352
"gifted in the arts of music and poetry."

356
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,272
- Talented.
- Special.

357
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,556
"Welcome to Durham, Dr Cross.

358
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,156
"Giovanni Giacomo Casanova
de Seingalt." You've got a fan.

359
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,995
I'll say one thing for our boy.
He's got nice penmanship.

360
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,233
- He's just fucking with you.
- This means he's tracking the case.

361
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,119
He's reading the local papers.
We can use that.

362
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,033
An odalisque is a statue,
a tall, pointy thing?

363
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,395
No, that's an obelisk.

364
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,590
An odalisque is a harem girl,
a concubine, a sex slave.

365
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,797
There it is, just like you said.

366
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,192
So he's telling us the gals are alive.
Why is he telling us that?

367
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,397
It demonstrates his power,
his dominance.

368
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,916
That fits. Our profiles
of the murdered women show

369
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,915
that they all shared one trait that
would set off the control freak in him.

370
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,358
They are all strong-willed.
They are all defiant.

371
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,994
How many of the other girls
share that profile?

372
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,469
At least one.

373
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,839
Ow!

374
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,313
Are you going to hurt me?
OK, come on.

375
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,040
They can be bigger

376
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,795
and they can be stronger...
You're fucking nuts!

377
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,351
I'll beat you.

378
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,196
Oh, my God!

379
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,670
You could have been the best, Kate.

380
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,879
I may be going crazy, but didn't I
warn you about breaking the rules?

381
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,998
- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry."

382
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,075
"I'm sorry."

383
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,237
- I'll do anything you want.
- What did you say?

384
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,349
- I said I'll do anything you want.
- Oh, I know you will.

385
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,719
Give me your arm.

386
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,633
I said give me your arm!

387
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,837
Come on. Give it to me.

388
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,993
Kate!

389
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,272
Kate!

390
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,640
KATE!

391
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,880
Kate!

392
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,229
KATE!

393
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,833
This is not the way it works, Kate.

394
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,593
All right, now. OK.

395
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,190
Easy, girl. Easy, now.

396
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,112
Come on.

397
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,791
- What do you know?
- Only that she is in shock.

398
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,272
The kids who found her
were fishing near Wykagil.

399
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,908
Wykagil. It's a river way out of town.

400
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,629
Well, lookee here.
We've got a circus up ahead.

401
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,598
- Detective, can you confirm...
- Back off.

402
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,994
<i>What concerns us</i>
<i>is behaviour that suggests</i>

403
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,310
psychological trauma,
especially acute.

404
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,837
Doctor, can you tell us exactly when
she'll be able to talk to us?

405
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,790
Kate McTiernan appears to be
suffering from post-traumatic shock.

406
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,669
There's no telling when she will be
lucid. It could be hours or weeks.

407
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,118
You have to remember
that she is very lucky to be alive.

408
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,158
- At least tell us your best bet.
- We can't go on that.

409
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,232
Dr Ruocco, my name is Dr Alex Cross.

410
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,960
I know who you are, I know your work.

411
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,078
I'm consulting with the local police
on this case.

412
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,675
I need to see Kate McTiernan.

413
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,355
I'm sorry, but she
does not need another doctor.

414
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,478
The last thing I want is to crowd you.

415
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,359
My request is personal.

416
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,399
One of the women abducted
was my niece.

417
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,790
I need to talk to her.

418
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,916
It's all right. You're safe now.

419
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,315
You are safe.

420
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,719
- This woman's a fighter.
- I wouldn't argue with that.

421
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,269
But we thought it was
post-traumatic shock.

422
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,149
Her vitals are meandering downhill.
Everything is shutting down.

423
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,518
- And you screened her for drugs?
- Yes. Her blood and urine are clean.

424
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,798
Something is doing damage
that we don't have a finger on.

425
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,838
- Whoever did this...
...is cunning.

426
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,757
But he doesn't know his history. The
real Casanova wouldn't have approved.

427
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,433
Excuse me. Do you have a PDR?

428
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,915
Unresponsive pupils, loss of muscular
control, escalating tremors...

429
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,071
Benzodiazepine would do that.

430
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,710
But all benzo drugs
show up in blood and urine.

431
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,713
Except Sistol. It's a benzo cousin.

432
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,953
Leukaemia specialists are using it
to take the edge off chemo.

433
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,315
- Is it an amnesiac?
- Absolutely.

434
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,593
We'll see what your theory
is made of by morning.

435
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,834
Who are you?

436
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,432
My name is Alex Cross.
I'm a policeman from Washington DC.

437
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,398
How do you feel?

438
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,471
Sick.

439
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,713
- I'll get you a doctor. Hang on.
- Wait. I was given a drug.

440
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,231
- I think it was a nervous system...
- Yeah, it was Sistol.

441
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,758
But we flushed it out of you.
It's nice to have you back.

442
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,275
- Washington?
- Yeah.

443
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,036
I'm down here because of my niece.

444
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,033
She disappeared about ten days ago.

445
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,919
Her name was Naomi Cross.

446
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,588
I talked to her.

447
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,108
I talked to her.

448
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,074
Thank you.

449
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,357
I'll get that doctor for you.

450
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,513
I heard so many different voices...

451
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,988
...and I tried not to cry.

452
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,834
- Our boy won't show his face here.
- If not, he's watching. I guarantee you.

453
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,073
You make it sound like
he ain't cooking on the front burner.

454
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,677
If he's so dumb,
how come we haven't caught him yet?

455
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,554
Ladies and gentlemen.

456
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:54,477
Good afternoon. I'd like to introduce
to you a very brave young lady.

457
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,358
Dr Kate McTiernan.

458
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,356
Dr McTiernan will make
a brief statement, and that's all.

459
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,431
No questions, please.

460
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,034
Hello, I'm Kate McTiernan.

461
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,597
First, I'd like to say something to the
families who have a loved one missing.

462
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,398
Please, do not give up hope. There are
other women where I was held,

463
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,518
and I believe in my heart
that they're still alive.

464
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:38,471
Second, to the boys who fished me out
of the river and saved my life,

465
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,350
and to the nurses and doctors here
who are taking such good care of me,

466
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,637
and for the thousands
of letters and prayers

467
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,634
I have received from
all across America, thank you.

468
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,757
And last...

469
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,915
...to the man
who calls himself "Casanova",

470
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,755
the man who took me
from my own home

471
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,639
and ultimately tried to kill me.

472
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,873
I broke your rules. Just me.

473
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,873
None of the other women helped.

474
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,670
So if you're looking for
someone to blame, blame me.

475
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,472
That's all I have to say right now.

476
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,873
Thank you for taking my message
to the families of the missing.

477
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,918
I hope it helps a little bit. Thank you.

478
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,272
- What do you hear? Dogs?
- No.

479
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,477
- Any kind of animals? Is it a farm?
- I don't know.

480
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,269
- Do you hear the river?
- No.

481
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,319
- I hear him... whispering.
- What does he say?

482
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,716
I can feel his mouth
on my ear, his breath.

483
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,114
He tells me that he loves me.

484
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,752
Tell me about his face.
Tell me about his eyes, his mouth.
