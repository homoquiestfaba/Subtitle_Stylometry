1
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,524
<i>We women have been
fighting for our rights</i>

2
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,923
<i>for way too long!</i>

3
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,087
<i>We have to start to speak louder
in order for our rights</i>

4
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,894
<i>to finally get heard
in the workplace.</i>

5
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,868
<i>Women are passed over
for promotion.</i>

6
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,995
They're passed over
for benefits.

7
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,836
They're passed over
for inclusion in the boardroom.

8
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,273
Or on Wall Street.

9
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:48,610
Today, only 10% of our
board of directors are women!

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,516
That is a crime
against women!

11
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:57,215
Today we love and respect
our elected legislator for women.

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,021
We women continue
to be used as objects.

13
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,028
<i>I wanna thank you
for coming out</i>

14
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,064
<i>and supporting our plight.</i>

15
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,827
Sensitivity
means so much to me.

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,393
Specially after what I went
through in my last relationship.

17
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,998
<i>...to be as successful
as any man on the planet.</i>

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,066
<i>And on top of that</i>

19
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:22,479
women's salary are 20%
less than men's.

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,248
Sir, would you come up
here, please?

21
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,295
Come on!
It's alright.

22
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,956
<i>We don't bite. Come on. Come on!</i>

23
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,462
Oh, oh!

24
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,008
Now, sir.

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,142
Women make 20% less
than you men do.

26
00:01:55,215 --> 00:02:01,176
Please, tell all of us
that that is not an injustice.

27
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,557
<i>Yeah, come on,
tell us!</i>

28
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,403
I'd easily be willing to
give up 20% of my income

29
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,273
to be able to have
a multiple orgasm.

30
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,648
<i>Why do you worry
about work anyway?</i>

31
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,652
Just find yourself a man.

32
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,753
<i>Get him, girls!</i>

33
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,664
I'm starting to enjoy being
with you more and more.

34
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,435
Don't let that go
to your head.

35
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,477
The last thing I need is
another overprotective boyfriend

36
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,638
that gets jealous
at the drop of a hat.

37
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,980
I actually think you should
start seeing other guys.

38
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,581
Just to make sure that
I'm the best prospect.

39
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,524
Excuse me, gentlemen.

40
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,730
<i>Take a look at the beautiful
lady standing right there.</i>

41
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,674
<i>She's a single, natural blond that
loves aromatherapy and African art.</i>

42
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,645
If interested, come over and
schedule a date for next weekend.

43
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,144
Oh, and she's getting
a boob job next week.

44
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,191
And she's open to a threesome
if you find the right woman.

45
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,894
<i>Hey, I'm Nick!</i>

46
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,165
I'm Jeff.

47
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,433
I'm Christopher.

48
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,511
<i>This is really romantic.
Kidnapping me for the day?</i>

49
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,376
I'm so happy I finally have a
boyfriend whose sense of adventure

50
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,077
is more than just taking
the dog to the park.

51
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:16,212
Before I reveal the surprise,
I'd like to make a toast.

52
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,018
Here's to you.

53
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,855
In such a short time you've
opened up the door of my heart

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:26,456
by having me overcome my fears
of passion, devotion, commitment.

55
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,660
Fears I thought I'd
never be able to overcome.

56
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:34,036
I only hope that in time I can help
you overcome your fears as well.

57
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,247
Starting with
your fear of flying.

58
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,681
<i>Ándele, ándele!</i>

59
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,116
<i>Hola, señor.</i>

60
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,388
<i>Rápidamente!</i>

61
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,968
Mr. Fix It, Computer
Repair Shop. Please hold.

62
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,100
What seems to be
the problem.

63
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,834
She won't respond
to my commands anymore.

64
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,012
You know what
it sounds like to me?

65
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,712
Hey.
Ooh!

66
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,781
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

67
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,986
Ooh, ah!

68
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,894
- Bill Smith?
- Mr. Fix it?

69
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,556
Lance Valenteen.

70
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,863
Have a seat, Bill.

71
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,997
So, did you love her?

72
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,866
Love-

73
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,001
Sophia?

74
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,636
Yes.

75
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,711
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,010
It was nice meeting you.

77
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,742
You know your way out.

78
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,685
But I love her.
I do.

79
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,126
Where did you touch her when she
wanted to forget about the world?

80
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,059
She loved
her head massaged.

81
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,962
<i>Where were her eyes the first
time you told her a secret?</i>

82
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,465
Hazing into mine.

83
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,865
First time
you saw her cry.

84
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,233
She lost her mother's
necklace. She's Italian-

85
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,601
You hurt.

86
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,300
I hurt her so bad.

87
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,669
It hurts like-
It's like-

88
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,044
Like only true love can.

89
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,750
Love.

90
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,512
Love that goes deeper
as the years progress.

91
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,219
Sorry, but I won't take a case
unless the client possesses true love.

92
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,591
Did you know
how I feel?

93
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,429
I found out a long time ago that
I was incapable of true love.

94
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,905
<i>Which gives me the unique
ability to help you out.</i>

95
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,711
<i>Research has shown that 88%
of the time a woman dumps a man</i>

96
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,615
<i>it's because
there's another guy.</i>

97
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,677
<i>Another guy we'll call
Different Dick.</i>

98
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,552
<i>Either she's dreaming about
him or she's already with him.</i>

99
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,319
<i>Sure, she may've
dumped you because-</i>

100
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,586
<i>He couldn't commit.</i>

101
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,321
<i>He was incredibly cheap.</i>

102
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,692
<i>He only loved himself.</i>

103
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,527
<i>He was hung like a South
American sand beetle.</i>

104
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,434
<i>But deep down inside, these women
are all saying the same thing.</i>

105
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,266
<i>I want a Different Dick.</i>

106
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,740
<i>Well, I give them just that.</i>

107
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,483
<i>Hi.
I'm Different Dick.</i>

108
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,678
<i>But I'm no ordinary
Different Dick.</i>

109
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:25,747
<i>I'm packed with information that allows
me to make you look like a better catch.</i>

110
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,225
<i>Get that shark
from Jaws!</i>

111
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,356
<i>First, we determine
why she left you.</i>

112
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,428
<i>Then I come up with a plan
on how to meet your ex...</i>

113
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,438
<i>...befriend her,
and date her!</i>

114
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,998
<i>Then, equipped with
knowledge provided by you</i>

115
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:49,514
<i>I turn from Different Dick
into your very own...</i>

116
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,516
<i>Mr. Fix It.</i>

117
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,747
<i>I become the epitome
of why you were dumped,</i>

118
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,381
<i>to prove that you really
weren't that bad after all.</i>

119
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,286
<i>I just didn't make Carol
laugh anymore.</i>

120
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,058
<i>How about this one?</i>

121
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,795
<i>What do you call a dinosaur
that's had sex with me?</i>

122
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,770
<i>A vagina-saurus.</i>

123
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,806
<i>Martha said
I was the jealous type.</i>

124
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,084
<i>If that guy hugs you
again like that,</i>

125
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,848
<i>I'm gonna break
his freaking jaw.</i>

126
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,021
<i>That's my brother.</i>

127
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,490
<i>I didn't know you were
from West Virginia.</i>

128
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,089
<i>Bonny said
I was inconsiderate.</i>

129
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,855
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

130
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,519
<i>What the fu-</i>

131
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,186
<i>Now she thinks
I'm a laugh riot.</i>

132
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,889
<i>She hasn't yelled at me
in months.</i>

133
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,124
<i>I didn't have to change.</i>

134
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,099
<i>I'm still a hung
like a chestnut,</i>

135
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,397
<i>but after how
Mr. Fix It behaved,</i>

136
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,563
<i>well, at least
I can still get it up.</i>

137
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,071
<i>Thanks, Mr. Fix it.</i>

138
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,767
<i>Here's the rules.</i>

139
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,470
<i>I will not have sex
with your ex.</i>

140
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,536
<i>Contract will now and always
remain 100% confidential.</i>

141
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,947
<i>And there's a full refund
if there's no reconciliation.</i>

142
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,349
<i>No exceptions whatsoever.</i>

143
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,911
<i>Mr. Fix It Inc.</i>

144
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,793
But I don't know
why she left me!

145
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,232
Well, um, phew,
that, um-

146
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,492
That changes things.

147
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,662
<i>You know, I-</i>

148
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,797
I'll pay double.

149
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,021
Lance Valenteen,
who crashed in the final lap

150
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,961
of last year's
street car race,

151
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:23,365
comes back this year to win this
coveted event in record time.

152
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,029
After all these years,
he'll finally get a chance

153
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,303
to race on the professional race
car circuit. I'll tell you, Chuck,

154
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,540
tonight he's going to bang like
a bongo at a Santana concert.

155
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,910
Chuck?

156
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,074
Excuse me.
Chuck?

157
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,674
Hey, Chuck.

158
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,777
<i>Excuse me.</i>

159
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,587
Excuse me.
Lance?

160
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,955
I said I'd pay double.

161
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,323
Hello?

162
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,286
Mr. Fix it?

163
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,897
You're going down.

164
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,962
You're going down!

165
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,069
These are the guys
that won it all last year.

166
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:09,342
Yeah. The tall guy
likes it down low.

167
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,542
The son a bitch
is always late.

168
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,375
Okay.

169
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,216
I'm gonna take a leap of faith
and say, "We're gonna win. "

170
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,482
<i>Who's with me?</i>

171
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,218
<i>Dude, seriously, joining
this league was your idea,</i>

172
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,726
and you still
can't show up on time.

173
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,260
I was in a meeting.

174
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,494
We had to discuss
fixing an Internet connection.

175
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,127
<i>Email access.</i>

176
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,170
<i>Wireless,</i>

177
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,604
homeless, boneless...

178
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,201
...chicken?

179
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,077
A little responsibility.
That's all I ask.

180
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,882
Could you please just act like
a grown up for one night a week?

181
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,110
So guys, huh?
Next week at 7:00 sharp.

182
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,875
We're a team.

183
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,247
Yeah.
Alright.

184
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,444
See you, guys.
Ow!

185
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,250
Good game. A lot of fun. Sharp.

186
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,384
"Wireless, homeless,
boneless chicken"?

187
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,792
You know as well as I do. If their
wives find out about Mr. Fix It,

188
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,596
I'll never be able
to see them again.

189
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,638
You gonna have to stop this
lying and start being yourself.

190
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,833
Tonight's not that night. I got
a new client I gotta scope out.

191
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,071
The exploration stage.
Then I can go.

192
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,080
You can go, but the client
personality evaluation

193
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,879
reveals low self-esteem, boring
tendencies, and multiple insecurities.

194
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,420
So she's homely
and fat.

195
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,082
I'm in.

196
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:06,256
<i>The client found a note in his ex's
pocketbook saying, "Go on at 8:00."</i>

197
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,926
Giggles.
Comedy club, huh?

198
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,491
Yeah.

199
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,560
I hope she's funny.

200
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,047
That must suck.

201
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,783
I know.
It must suck getting old.

202
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,382
Staying young
is the secret to life.

203
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,395
Yeah. Right now the secret
to life is not waiting.

204
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,863
Come on!
Let's get Giggles going!

205
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,498
<i>Starting off amateur night,
here's Sophia.</i>

206
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,010
Do not talk.

207
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,136
Then how does one
become your friend?

208
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,416
Either make me laugh
or make me orgasm.

209
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,251
What if I can do both?

210
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,019
Then you will be
my very good friend.

211
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,993
<i>Alright, put your hands
together for Sophia.</i>

212
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,557
<i>Now it's time for Cherry.</i>

213
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:00,962
I can tell tha-

214
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,098
Do not follow me
another step,

215
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,406
or I will tie you down,
remove your clothes,

216
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,469
and make you nice
and comfortable.

217
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,712
Do you know that bouncer
over there?

218
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:16,277
He will pluck out each one of your
genital hairs with boiling tweezers

219
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,152
while wearing a blindfold.

220
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,228
I wonder what you have to do
to be her best friend.

221
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,629
<i>Um, she-</i>

222
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,763
<i>She loves her dog Maxine.</i>

223
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,571
<i>There's this dog park on her street
where she just plays with her for hours.</i>

224
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,750
What about this one?

225
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,877
<i>That one was the stud on a kennel
that got closed down last month.</i>

226
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,649
The poor little guy
must be lonely, huh?

227
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,907
Your name is Max.
Got it? Max.

228
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,917
Hold on.

229
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,164
Uh! Geez.

230
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,134
<i>You alright?</i>

231
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,907
I- I'm trying to teach my dog
how to lie down.

232
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,108
<i>See?
Like this.</i>

233
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,809
Is that a smile?

234
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,510
This means I'm half way
to being your good friend.

235
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,450
I do not like men
who follow me.

236
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,010
Follow you?
I just moved here.

237
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,283
I was showing Max
his new hangout.

238
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,124
My dog's name is Max.
Uh, Maxine.

239
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,630
Where is your Max?

240
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,299
He's over there.

241
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,479
He's studying to be
a proctologist.

242
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,713
Now I'm more
than halfway.

243
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,984
This means you have to let me
take you out to dinner. I'm Lance.

244
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,515
I'm new in town, and, right
now, you're my only friend.

245
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,492
Do not worry. Because if
you're anything like your dog,

246
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,462
you'll make friends quick.

247
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,868
Help.
Help!

248
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,642
<i>She loves boarding down to the
promenade to see the street performers.</i>

249
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,413
<i>The wackier,
the better.</i>

250
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,856
<i>For my finale
I will use this wood.</i>

251
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,825
It is no ordinary wood.

252
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:46,892
It is sacred wood.

253
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,398
Ooh!

254
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,408
<i>Now that we have
honored the wood,</i>

255
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,249
it is okay to destroy the wood.

256
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,415
<i>Thank you.</i>

257
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,788
Please, give your donations for
my show to the human bowling ball.

258
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,962
How about breaking this?

259
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,535
No.

260
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,171
This is a nice board.

261
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,840
I'm getting a new one.

262
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,044
<i>Yeah, come on!</i>

263
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,519
Yeah, come on!
Do it!

264
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,577
You can do it.

265
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,283
Break it.

266
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,275
<i>Ooh!</i>

267
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,220
<i>You're not making
the Porsche?</i>

268
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:03,290
So why don't you just quit
when the job gets this tough?

269
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,731
Please, don't yell.

270
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,137
Sorry.

271
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,072
<i>It pays double.
If they reconcile,</i>

272
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,134
I'll be able to get
another shot at the race.

273
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,474
I thought
that bird died.

274
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,811
<i>He was staying in my
room, but my new dog, Max,</i>

275
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,852
he likes sleeping in there.
But this bird, he gets restless,

276
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,012
<i>starts yelling,
and he won't shut up.</i>

277
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,251
<i>Use two hands, honey.
It won't bite.</i>

278
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,919
You're keeping it
in the bedroom, huh?

279
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,396
<i>That's why
you're still single</i>

280
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,956
<i>because those are
the type of girls you date.</i>

281
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,231
<i>That's it, baby.
Spank it like you mean it.</i>

282
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,003
<i>Even if I was capable of-</i>

283
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:46,202
Where would I find a girl who
wasn't a bit afraid of racing cars?

284
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:50,146
<i>Or someone who would do something insane
to see if she had the guts to do it?</i>

285
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:54,584
Or someone who could dance the mambo with
me so well that we could do it blindfolded?

286
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,178
<i>Cucumbers are
in the refrigerator.</i>

287
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,253
That's kinky.

288
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,318
Lance.

289
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,449
Kenneth.

290
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,628
<i>I thought I told you to keep
your ass off this track.</i>

291
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,458
What are you doing here?
Isn't it past your bedtime?

292
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,326
<i>Racers, please
prepare to race.</i>

293
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,113
<i>The winner,
receive your winning tickets.</i>

294
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,742
<i>And here we go.</i>

295
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:01,808
Three.

296
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,519
<i>Two.</i>

297
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,920
<i>One.</i>

298
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,359
Compliments from my dog.

299
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,929
That bit.

300
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,401
That's just disrespectful.

301
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,334
You can't break the rules.

302
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,599
You should be removed
from the track.

303
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,034
- Good driving.
- You've got a gift.

304
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,198
Do you give lessons?

305
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,107
Thanks, boys.
That was fun.

306
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,084
Turn off your engines, boys.
This is a man's job.

307
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,817
<i>Yeah, but she doesn't
like feminine things.</i>

308
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,416
<i>I'm smoother than you,
and I want the best.</i>

309
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,190
<i>Don't forget to tell her
about the chlamydia.</i>

310
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,877
You know, some
might just call this fate.

311
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,916
I call it bad timing.

312
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,574
<i>How is your head?</i>

313
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,176
Better than my heart.
You're a tough girl.

314
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,778
<i>I just got out
of a relationship,</i>

315
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,585
and I'm not looking
for another.

316
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,488
I do not enjoy
conversation,

317
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,390
specially with men
I do not know.

318
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,429
And I am moving back
to Italy in a month

319
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,897
because I hate
American men.

320
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,457
Do you still
want a date?

321
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,489
It's not my fault you cannot
handle a big set of melons.

322
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,677
I need to get her
fixed up for street.

323
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,583
We don't work
on junk yard cars here.

324
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:07,182
I thought Wally could make
every car be a star!

325
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,852
Wally could,
but Wally's gone.

326
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,488
His kids forced him
into retirement.

327
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,588
<i>Said he was
getting useless.</i>

328
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,863
He's was put out to pasture. Much
like you should do with this car.

329
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,597
<i>If you got your heart
bent on it,</i>

330
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,504
<i>leave it here and I'll take it
back to the junk yard myself.</i>

331
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,135
Where's Wally now?

332
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,871
Beautiful, isn't she?

333
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,939
Beautiful isn't the word.

334
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,675
Solid frame.

335
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,186
Nice, nice!

336
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,119
Yeah.

337
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,488
She needs a new
front end at least.

338
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,651
She looks good
to me.

339
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,127
Front and rear
is smoking!

340
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,529
Ooh, I wanna get under her
and see what she's packing.

341
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,769
If this left hand could still
stretch for the ninth cord,

342
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,809
those O'Maley widows
would be ours!

343
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,901
Dom-di-dom-dom.

344
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,387
We gotta get her
fixed up for street.

345
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,186
I'm sure if you guys
can help,

346
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,230
I'm willing to take
a leap of faith.

347
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,360
It takes more than a
slick car and a fast dream

348
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,904
and a leap of faith
to win the big race.

349
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,339
It's big shoulders
and wide eyes.

350
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,703
And steel balls.

351
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:13,441
You crashed last year because
your reflexes were too slow.

352
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,912
Have they gotten
any quicker this year?

353
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:32,600
<i>She'll need an engine overhaul.
All the rockers, timing change.</i>

354
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,663
Labor's free. You pay for the
parts we get at Mean Mike's.

355
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,368
That's due on the day
of the race.

356
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,310
<i>This way you'll have the
same chance as anybody else.</i>

357
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,973
<i>Assuming that your reflexes
are as fast on the track</i>

358
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,039
as they were
on the garage today.

359
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,082
There's the loaner.

360
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,229
<i>She loves Carlini's.</i>

361
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:09,535
<i>Specially the mussels and clams appetizer
with the eggplant Parmesan entree.</i>

362
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,167
<i>Although she's not too crazy
about all the cheese.</i>

363
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,741
<i>We'll start with
the mussels and the clams.</i>

364
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,508
<i>For the entree, two eggplant
Parmesans, please.</i>

365
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,277
Go easy
on the mozzarella.

366
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,415
You got this so perfect.

367
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,682
Sometimes you have
to take chances.

368
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,018
To taking chances?

369
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,258
I was taking a chance
the night you met me.

370
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,422
Dancing?

371
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,161
Sometimes I like to do crazy things
just to see if I will actually do them.

372
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,465
Me, too.

373
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,636
That's why I was Samurai Sal. I
was doing fine until you came along.

374
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,941
I wanted to give
those kids a treat.

375
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,071
I love kids.

376
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,878
They can just always
be themselves.

377
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,009
I hate people who have
to put on an act.

378
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,280
Me, too.

379
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,289
That's why I'm moving back
to Italy in a month.

380
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,984
<i>I don't have
many friends here.</i>

381
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,253
I haven't had
a close friend in years.

382
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,556
Unless you include Max.

383
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,690
I love my Max.
I love all animals, actually.

384
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,326
Except for birds.

385
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,869
Like rats with wings.

386
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,333
To our Maxes.

387
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,710
You said you just
got out of a relationship.

388
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,907
What happened
to that friend?

389
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,574
He was not
the best looking man.

390
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,018
But, uh, he was sweet
and loyal.

391
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,887
It's a hard combination
to find in a man.

392
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:36,688
<i>He started to do something
that I cannot stand for.</i>

393
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,126
What's that?

394
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,959
He started to do-

395
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,563
He started to, uh-

396
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:47,661
Started to-

397
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,205
How do you say?

398
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,299
He started to-

399
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,074
Hello?

400
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:04,247
Now?
Uh, yeah, no.

401
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,718
I must go.

402
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,920
Do you want me-

403
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,486
No.
Sit, enjoy your food

404
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,930
and, um, I will make
this up to you.

405
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,769
He started to lie
about who he was

406
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,644
and not being himself.

407
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,350
Do you understand?

408
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,225
Kind of.

409
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,157
<i>You lied.</i>

410
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,224
I told her
I was a Navy Seal.

411
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,763
What else?

412
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,772
That I was a master chef.

413
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,831
I can't even toast
a Pop Tart.

414
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,069
Okay, just calm down.

415
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,941
Calm down.

416
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,408
I have already devised
a plan for reconciliation.

417
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,289
Every girl
has got the perfect man

418
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,190
that she dreams about spending
the rest of her life with.

419
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,821
<i>Not so much as looks, you
know, but his personality.</i>

420
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,492
His dreams.
His desires.

421
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,798
<i>I'm gonna find out what that
perfect man is and become him.</i>

422
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,339
She'll fall for me.
Actually, Mr. Fix It.

423
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,932
So much that she'll cancel
her move back to Italy.

424
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,874
She's moving back
to Italy?

425
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,471
When she cancels her move,
she's fallen for Mr. Fix It.

426
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,311
Then,

427
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,883
I'll reveal that all the
reasons she fell for me are lies.

428
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:50,449
Lies told on an effort to become
her good friend for those two weeks.

429
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,292
<i>But now that she's cancelled the
move, she's gotta know the truth</i>

430
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,390
because I don't want a relationship
and I don't want to fall in love.

431
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,799
It'll make your lies
look like childhood fibs.

432
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:03,135
She'll be in such a tale spin, she's
gonna need someone to hold on to.

433
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,504
That's where you come in.

434
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,133
Will it work?

435
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,303
Take a leap of faith!

436
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,246
Now, do you have anything
that'll remind her of you?

437
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,879
I have this candelabra on my
coffee table. She loves it.

438
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,943
Great.
Send it to this address.

439
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,012
Oh, and, uh-

440
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,589
learn some of this, uh?

441
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,685
She likes it
when you speak Italian.

442
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,899
<i>Hello, babe,
what's going on?</i>

443
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,971
<i>Don't forget tonight until
10:30 all drinks 50% off.</i>

444
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,989
Hope you left
your cellphone at home

445
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,620
'cause I'm not letting you
get off so easy.

446
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,823
I never get off easy.

447
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,200
Two Jack and Cokes.
Easy on the Coke.

448
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:39,993
Gutsy.

449
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,628
I like a man
who takes control.

450
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,970
I saw you.
You like when people watch.

451
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,374
There's a better view
from upstairs.

452
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,881
This place lets people
forget their troubles.

453
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,745
They're much more free.

454
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,672
I like a girl
who can drink.

455
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,105
Come on.

456
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,244
I told you it's a
better view from up here.

457
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,248
Look at them.

458
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,024
Do you want
to be free, Lance?

459
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,289
Dance with me.

460
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:40,787
Dance with me.

461
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,423
It's been a long time since-

462
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,825
You bitch.

463
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,234
Sorry?

464
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,934
You gotta be kidding me.

465
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,235
You know this guy?

466
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,568
No.

467
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,912
Okay, pal. Why don't you
go home and sleep it off?

468
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,044
All I wanna know
is why you did it.

469
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,888
I'm gonna put this
as nicely as possible.

470
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,463
<i>Ugh!
Oh!</i>

471
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,308
I'm gonna break
your face!

472
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,638
<i>It's getting stuffed in here.
Let's get some air.</i>

473
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,162
I want to dance.

474
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,000
What are they doing?

475
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,810
I want to dance.

476
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,656
Let's dance.

477
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,185
Whoa!

478
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,270
Come, come.

479
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,577
Ta-ra.

480
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,214
I rescue this damsel
in distress

481
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,782
and all she has for me
is her laugh.

482
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,732
And a kiss.

483
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,131
Ugh!
But you are still a frog.

484
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,169
<i>I like a man who can dance.</i>

485
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,715
You like a man who can dance
and who takes control.

486
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,546
So far, you know,
I'm two for two.

487
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,052
What else do you like?
What is your perfect man?

488
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,681
I like a man
who is spontaneous.

489
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,452
Let's fly to Paris
right now.

490
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,390
I like a man
who is romantic.

491
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,022
Shall I compare thee
to summer's day?

492
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,394
Thou art more lovely.

493
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:11,127
I like a man
who is cocky.

494
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,169
Falling in love with me,
aren't you?

495
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,501
I like a man
who is funny.

496
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:18,439
What do you get when you cross
an elephant with a rhinoceros?

497
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,498
Elephino.

498
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:25,540
I like a man who sacrifices making
a lot of money to pursue a dream.

499
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,313
A dream which he can reach and one
which he cannot wait to share with me.

500
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:33,413
And I like a man who is in touch
with the child that lives inside,

501
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,287
and he likes to play
childish games,

502
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,793
and he's not embarrassed
to play them with me.

503
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:41,422
And I like a man who is willing
to take a leap of faith.

504
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:45,298
And I can see his faith in us
every time he looks at me,

505
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,897
and I can feel it in his touch
every time he caresses me.

506
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,537
But most of all,

507
00:46:56,446 --> 00:47:00,405
I like a man who knows how
to quit when he's ahead.

508
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:24,503
<i>Every year this town holds
a Citrus Beach street car race</i>

509
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,975
for anyone who qualifies.
It's quite the event.

510
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,205
People come
from miles away to watch.

511
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,577
If you win, you get to race
in the Clearway 200.

512
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,139
Professional drivers,
professional track.

513
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:38,052
If you win in street, it's the
best chance to get on the circuit.

514
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,055
Is that your dream?

515
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,957
That's why I'm in this town.
This year's gonna be my year.

516
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,757
Where is
your dream machine?

517
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,979
It is beautiful.

518
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,953
I want to be the first
to give you a victory kiss.

519
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,095
You're not afraid
of racing cars?

520
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,557
Takes a lot more than that
to scare me.

521
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,132
Me, too.

522
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,699
Hi, Max.
Hello.

523
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,164
Hello.
Hello!

524
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,203
My ex has a candelabra
just like these.

525
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,283
He did have god taste.

526
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,784
Do you miss him?

527
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:17,080
<i>I don't miss the lying.</i>

528
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,055
And I certainly don't miss how
he always wanted to have sex

529
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,318
in the middle
of a touching moment.

530
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,524
Who is this?

531
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:35,571
<i>That's my dad.
He's a good driver.</i>

532
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,266
Came here to race
when I was a kid.

533
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,569
Did he race a lot?

534
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,008
He was always taking me
to see the cars.

535
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,911
I loved the cars. He truly
felt I could do anything

536
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,473
as long as I believed
that dreams come true.

537
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:49,576
He always said that.

538
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,587
Do you see him often?

539
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,593
He died
when I was 18.

540
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,774
He had a great smile.

541
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,947
When I close my eyes
and see him,

542
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:22,950
he's always smiling.

543
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,923
You have his smile.

544
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,826
Can I rip off your panties
and make love to you right now?

545
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,606
No!

546
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,107
I'm not wearing
any panties.

547
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,648
We shouldn't do this.

548
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,618
No.

549
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,117
Phone, phone.

550
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,117
Hello?

551
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,495
<i>Tonight?</i>

552
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,987
Uh, um, I'll-

553
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,465
<i>I'll pack some
up on the way.</i>

554
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,263
Okay. Okay.

555
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,805
<i>I must go.</i>

556
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,336
Good bye my... good friend.

557
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,360
<i>Seems like everybody's
got a girlfriend.</i>

558
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,226
Even I got a girlfriend.
I hate to tell you this, Lance,

559
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,765
but it looks like
you're the last man standing.

560
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,765
Sure I am.

561
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,470
What's the big deal
about love, anyway?

562
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,702
These people
seem to need it.

563
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:30,837
Do you think these people
really feel true love?

564
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,781
Or is it just companionship?

565
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,874
Excuse me, sir.

566
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,181
<i>Immediately after you finish
making love,</i>

567
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:41,054
do you think about how fortunate it is
to share such unconditional intimacy,

568
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,115
or do you just fall asleep?

569
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,060
What do you think?

570
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,496
But I don't snore,
do I, honey?

571
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,995
Hey, you. When you
set the alarm at night,

572
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:56,300
do you give yourself and extra
half hour just so you can hold her?

573
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,710
<i>Ouch!</i>

574
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:05,207
<i>When you're together
and there's silence,</i>

575
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,910
do you think about
what the other's thinking?

576
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,919
I think about the dog
I wanna get.

577
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,478
You don't think about me?

578
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:19,994
This place makes me sick.

579
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,698
Wait! This Italian
girl does crazy things

580
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,668
just to see
if she can do them.

581
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,397
Can dance the mambo
blindfolded.

582
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,338
Isn't afraid of racing cars
and you feel nothing.

583
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,275
She's a job. A job that's
about to kick in overdrive.

584
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:35,777
Oh, no.

585
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,369
The pretty and pig stage.

586
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,479
That's right.

587
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:43,178
Time to make her love me like
a montage in a bad '80s movie.

588
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,348
What are you thinking?

589
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,950
The ocean.

590
00:54:58,762 --> 00:54:59,990
It's loud.

591
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:03,065
There's really nothing
to look at except water.

592
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,760
And it smells
like fish.

593
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:08,031
Yet, it is so soothing.

594
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:11,130
My grandma, she lives
on the beach in Italy.

595
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:15,541
And all she does is sit on her
deck and stare at the waves.

596
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,944
As if each one
is a different memory.

597
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,312
Couple more days
and you'll be seeing her.

598
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,957
My ex-boyfriend is here.

599
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,783
<i>Go say hello.</i>

600
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:33,821
<i>Grazie.</i>

601
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,826
<i>Just like I said.</i>

602
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,599
Say hi.

603
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,970
<i>Better keep you
in her mind.</i>

604
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,317
He's a sweet man.

605
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,552
A liar but sweet.

606
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:08,024
He actually said
that I was his true love.

607
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,090
It's funny.

608
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,633
<i>Why?</i>

609
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,498
Don't you believe
true love exists?

610
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,262
Don't ask me.

611
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,169
You should ask someone
who has lived.

612
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,747
<i>Wanna know if
we believe in what?</i>

613
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:28,875
True love.

614
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,115
Sure. The kind of love that grows
deeper as the years progress.

615
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,849
Exactly.

616
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,551
See if that fixed it.

617
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,423
Hold it, hold it.

618
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:43,296
So, what you wanna know
is if we believe in true love.

619
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:48,770
Yeah. We've all been lucky enough
to find it at least once in our life.

620
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,272
Don't you believe
that it exists?

621
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,105
I think I'm incapable of it.

622
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:01,183
<i>Incapable?</i>

623
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,741
You're afraid.

624
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,148
Look at you.
Young and vibrant.

625
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,155
<i>You have the whole
world in your grasp.</i>

626
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:10,215
Maybe that's why you don't
have love in your life.

627
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,761
You're afraid
if you fall in love,

628
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,297
maybe you'll lose
all of that.

629
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:19,802
And you'll end up like we did. Like, uh, they say
- What do they say we were?

630
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,837
Useless.

631
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,236
Yeah.

632
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,501
Useless.

633
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:29,802
<i>Ah. Ah!</i>

634
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,172
Bingo.

635
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,274
You fixed it?

636
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,751
No. We have to go
to Bingo.

637
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,220
<i>If we don't leave now,</i>

638
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,349
we're not gonna be able to sit
across from the O'Maley widows.

639
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:45,690
Don't worry about it, kid.
You'll figure it out.

640
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,472
Wally and the boys
say good luck.

641
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,008
It looks great, Lance.
You're up.

642
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,145
That is for luck.

643
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,008
There's lot
of good racers here.

644
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,883
You know, I think
I need more luck.

645
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:52,326
The thin track, luck, and
sometimes play rolling-

646
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,726
Sun can sometimes-

647
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:01,135
<i>Lance Valenteen,
please sign in.</i>

648
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,466
Coming, coming!

649
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,772
<i>What do you think, Lance?</i>

650
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,381
<i>It's like
a dream come true.</i>

651
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,118
Spread the word, Lance.

652
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,127
<i>Yeah. That us old folks
ain't got useless after all.</i>

653
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,456
Spread the word.

654
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:16,804
How is he doing?

655
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:17,903
Not bad.

656
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:58,646
<i>You're in, Lance. Best
time, yet. See you Sunday.</i>

657
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,508
Too bad you're not gonna
be around to see me race.

658
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,044
I'm not going anywhere.

659
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,374
Bu- but Italy-

660
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:28,406
I cancelled my move, Lance. There
is no way I'm going to miss this.

661
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,091
<i>You'll have the money
for the parts, right?</i>

662
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,699
I sure will.

663
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,376
That's all
we gotta say?

664
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:59,210
And you'll give us
all those tickets?

665
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,341
Yeah.

666
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:04,045
You want me to pull away
after she sees me and the dog.

667
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,019
You got an extra
set of keys, right?

668
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,219
We'll just park it
round the corner.

669
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:45,552
Lance-a-rooney!

670
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,926
Hi, Pops. How about
dinner tomorrow night?

671
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:48,986
Sure.

672
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,862
I know this is gonna
sound strange.

673
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,561
But, uh, I was wondering
if you could wait-

674
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,598
<i>Tomorrow is D-day.</i>

675
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,572
This is how
is gonna work.

676
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,441
Sophia loves dogs.

677
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:06,914
She loves my dog Max.

678
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,417
<i>At 6:30 she's gonna
arrive at my house</i>

679
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:12,283
<i>for an evening
of dinner and dance.</i>

680
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:13,754
<i>As she walks up,</i>

681
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,849
<i>she'll see the local dog
catcher parked outside my house.</i>

682
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,351
<i>Caged in the back
will be Max,</i>

683
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:23,592
<i>being driven away
to a seemingly helpless fate.</i>

684
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:29,700
<i>Then at 6:32,</i>

685
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,266
what happened to the inner child
that she treasures in a man?

686
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:37,205
<i>A group of kids who
know Sophia from Go Karts</i>

687
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,009
<i>will tell her
they've seen her with me.</i>

688
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,345
<i>They'll beg her to talk
some sense into me.</i>

689
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:44,853
<i>I threatened to beat them up when
they played their loud stupid games</i>

690
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,718
<i>outside my house.</i>

691
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,952
<i>I broke a bike one time
I got so mad.</i>

692
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,756
<i>I love car racing.</i>

693
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,697
<i>My dream is to win street.</i>

694
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:59,462
Following your dream
is very important to her.

695
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,833
<i>More important than money.</i>

696
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:06,638
<i>At 6:40 she'll think that fixing up
my Camaro was not to pursue my dream</i>

697
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,677
<i>but to make a quick buck.</i>

698
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:15,546
<i>There will be two guys high-fiving
each other excited to race street.</i>

699
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:19,076
<i>Excited because
they just bought a rare.</i>

700
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,656
<i>Then, at 6:44
she enters my house.</i>

701
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:30,392
<i>My recently acquired house, since
she thinks I just moved to town.</i>

702
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,060
<i>She'll start asking
all these questions.</i>

703
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,570
<i>The car,
the kids, the dog.</i>

704
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,766
<i>Then she'll see my bird
and be like,</i>

705
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:42,777
<i>"You have a bird?
You hate birds. "</i>

706
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:54,116
<i>In an effort to calm her down,
I'll ask her to sit by me.</i>

707
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,217
<i>When she does,</i>

708
01:04:57,293 --> 01:05:00,456
<i>I'll show her my Citrus
Beach High School yearbook.</i>

709
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,429
<i>She'll realize
I didn't just move to town.</i>

710
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:11,236
<i>I've lived here all my life.</i>

711
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,437
That's when I tell her
that everything

712
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,106
has been a lie.

713
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,213
I'm not who you think I am.

714
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,548
<i>I'll tell her.</i>

715
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:27,578
I'm actually... a liar.

716
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,249
Max was my dog,
I hate birds,

717
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,227
I love to do childish things. I'm new
in this town. My dream is to race cars.

718
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:36,732
They were all lies. Lies told on
an effort to become your good friend

719
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:40,030
<i>until you left for Italy. But
now that you're not leaving,</i>

720
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:43,868
I can't continue the lying, and I
certainly can't continue to see you.

721
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,336
<i>At that point
she'll probably stand up,</i>

722
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,401
<i>throw something at me,
and leave.</i>

723
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,320
<i>To top it off,
as she's leaving</i>

724
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,857
<i>she'll see my father
on the other side of the door.</i>

725
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,050
<i>Alive and well.</i>

726
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:23,612
<i>At 7:45 you surprise her with a dozen
roses and a sympathetic shoulder.</i>

727
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,581
<i>Right now, your lies are the
farthest thing from her mind.</i>

728
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:36,291
My life will be complete
if this works.

729
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,358
So will mine.

730
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:44,162
<i>It has to work, 'cause
she's the only one for me</i>

731
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,292
and I don't wanna
grow old alone.

732
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,570
That would suck.

733
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,682
Hurry up. You're the one
who wanted to do this.

734
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,193
I feel like
I'm 20 years old.

735
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,377
Alright, maybe 40.

736
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:34,677
Lad, a little help.

737
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,126
Oh!

738
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,221
<i>I can't remember
the last time I ran so fast.</i>

739
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,054
I don't feel
so useless now.

740
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,684
Did you see that,
Lance?

741
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,704
I'm not sure
what I'm seeing.

742
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,066
Surprise!

743
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:30,708
Sophia,
you didn't need to-

744
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:35,045
What I need and what I
want is seldom different.

745
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,389
Yes.

746
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,084
I'm on my way.

747
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:46,321
I have to run, but, um,
I will come back later.

748
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:47,589
We go dancing, yes?

749
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,722
Why do you always
get called away?

750
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,292
You want to see my dream?

751
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,167
<i>This country
is the only country</i>

752
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,301
<i>that does not cherish
its elders.</i>

753
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,744
<i>It thinks they're, um,
how do you say?</i>

754
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,838
Useless?

755
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,377
My dream is to change
all that

756
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:12,079
by showing how much
older people can still give.

757
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,152
Who knows?

758
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,953
It might even reveal
the secret to life.

759
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,630
She's ready for you now.

760
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,636
<i>I apologize, but you just never
know when they're ready to open up.</i>

761
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,197
<i>Grazie.</i>

762
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,457
<i>She was beautiful.</i>

763
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,223
Come.

764
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,505
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

765
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,013
I brought a friend today,
Ms. Cliverhorn.

766
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:43,839
Okay. Whenever
you're ready.

767
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,275
I thought about your question

768
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:51,080
and it kept me up several
nights as it did others.

769
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,087
I thought it was
a difficult question,

770
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,487
but actually
it's quite simple.

771
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,160
<i>When I was young,
about your age,</i>

772
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:02,755
I was fascinated
with old people.

773
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:06,790
I watched them as if they
were warning signs of life.

774
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,133
"Be careful or some day
you'll be old. "

775
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:14,002
It made me believe that the
secret of life was staying young.

776
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:19,743
<i>No responsibilities,
no worries, no problems.</i>

777
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:25,445
As long as I remained
spontaneous, playful, and carefree,

778
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,512
I would never become old.

779
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:32,550
<i>Unfortunately, possessing those
qualities had a bitter side effect.</i>

780
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:35,689
Loneliness.

781
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:40,825
When I was young I didn't notice
the loneliness, but as I got older

782
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,929
staying young became
more and more difficult.

783
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:48,067
<i>Loneliness, I realized,
was starting to make me old.</i>

784
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:53,842
But instead of finding somebody to be
spontaneous, playful, and carefree with me,

785
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,145
I continued lying to myself.

786
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,051
As so many do.

787
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:02,556
Until now.

788
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:07,395
The secret of life
isn't staying young.

789
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:13,426
The secret of life is finding a love
that grows fonder as you grow older.

790
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:17,969
It's what many call true love.

791
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:24,844
Because when you have true love you
feel young, no matter what age you are.

792
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:42,890
True love
makes you young.

793
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,596
Do you understand?

794
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:19,591
Bill. Bill!

795
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,034
What the hell
are you doing?

796
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:27,007
Oh, hey, Lance. What's up?
I'll be right back, okay?

797
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:31,603
How're you doing?

798
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,574
Who's that?

799
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,743
Uh, Carol.

800
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,480
Great kisser but not the
brightest ball in the house.

801
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:43,888
Which is good, 'cause it'll make it easier
to cheat on Sophia when I get her back.

802
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,449
But you were
so distraught.

803
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,757
I'm paying you
to do a job.

804
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,956
If you'll excuse me,
I need to get her home

805
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:51,659
so I can prepare
for my big night.

806
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:55,100
'Cause I hate for you to have to
give me that car and miss the race

807
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,970
since it seems you already used
my refund money to fix it up.

808
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,167
Right?

809
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:51,219
You're dating that guy
who races go karts, right?

810
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:56,457
You seem like a nice lady
but... that guy is crazy.

811
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,704
Look what he did
to my bicycle.

812
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,969
<i>You are sure
this is Lance?</i>

813
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:12,775
Lives in there?
It's him.

814
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,577
Sorry to tell you
all this, lady.

815
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,742
But he's making our lives
living hell.

816
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:19,048
He doesn't even
take showers.

817
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:20,950
I'll talk to him.

818
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:22,512
Thanks, lady.

819
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:30,624
<i>We got us
a new ride, baby.</i>

820
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,793
This baby's taking me
to the promised land.

821
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,098
Yeah!

822
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:01,128
I just saw Max
an- and these boys.

823
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:04,188
They said you've been hurting
them. You car, did you sell it?

824
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,665
<i>Where is Max going?
And-</i>

825
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:08,029
A bird?

826
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,094
I thought you hated birds.

827
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:14,301
Calm down.
Just... sit here.

828
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:21,341
I don't understand.

829
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,862
It's 1995.

830
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,625
You said you just moved here.

831
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,938
I needed you to see
all this because...

832
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,378
I'm not who you think I am.

833
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,044
I'm actually-

834
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,330
You are actually what?

835
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:15,902
I'm actually...

836
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:19,470
Mr. Fix It.

837
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:22,572
I was hired by
your ex-boyfriend Bill

838
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,043
to make you
get back with him.

839
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,205
You broke up with him
because of his lying.

840
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:27,942
I was supposed
to get you to fall for me

841
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:29,779
and then tell you
everything was lies.

842
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,081
His lies wouldn't look
that bad. I can't do it

843
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:34,519
because
I've fallen for you.

844
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:45,795
So thi- this is all
been a job.

845
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:47,767
Yes!

846
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:48,894
No!

847
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:52,371
I haven't been Mr. Fix It. I've
been who I've never been able to be.

848
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,964
Myself.

849
01:21:57,646 --> 01:22:01,776
Well, I never
want to see you again.

850
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,081
<i>Listen to me, okay?</i>

851
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:08,054
Look, I'm in love with you.

852
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:13,987
Love?

853
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,591
What do you know
about love?

854
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:21,602
I can't think of tomorrow
without thinking of you.

855
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,104
And that makes me,
for the first time ever,

856
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:27,164
look forward
to the rest of my life.

857
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:34,173
Please!

858
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:39,318
Don't open that door.

859
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,015
I am actually

860
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,321
Karen Shawnassy.

861
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:21,624
Also known as Ms. Fix It.

862
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:29,293
My employees.

863
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:32,033
<i>Bill Smith.
Maggy Cliverhorn.</i>

864
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,337
Also of course your friends

865
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:39,176
<i>who hired me to prove to you that you
really are capable of love after all.</i>

866
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,080
I hope you realize
what a special gift it is.

867
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:48,111
Because to go through life without
love, is to never live at all.

868
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,180
I believe you owe us
a refund.

869
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:54,055
No exceptions whatsoever.

870
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:11,609
It's around the corner.

871
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:14,638
If it's any consolation,

872
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,551
<i>I was really starting-</i>

873
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:30,681
Hey, Lance.

874
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:35,952
The guys have known about
Mr. Fix It for a long time.

875
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:38,484
I'm sorry.

876
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,927
We just... wanted to show you
how important love is.

877
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:48,034
Well... congratulations.
You succeeded.

878
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,367
Come on.
I've got a surprise for you.

879
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,406
I've had enough surprises.

880
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:56,068
Yeah, I know, but, uh,
this one's really fast.

881
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:18,621
Hey, Lance.

882
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,065
It's all yours.

883
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,432
It's ready for action.

884
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,669
Listen to me.

885
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:31,201
Stay alert. Watch the
sides. Keep it even.

886
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:34,305
And do not be afraid
to make a mistake.

887
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:36,145
Even a great car
can make a mistake.

888
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:38,651
No matter how good she feels
or how good she looks.

889
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,814
And that's when the driver
has to be forgiving.

890
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:45,120
Because that's the only way you're
gonna get to the finish line.

891
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:04,873
I questioned early on
whether or not

892
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,073
you were gonna be
my last case.

893
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:19,756
You see, things started to
feel just different with you.

894
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:22,593
And the more time
we spent together,

895
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:24,757
the more caring
started to come out.

896
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,103
Hey.

897
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:36,108
Hey.
How's it going?

898
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:38,645
I actually think
he's really cute.

899
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:39,702
Oh-oh.

900
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:42,045
Do you think
these socks are too much?

901
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:45,981
<i>And I questioned
for the first time</i>

902
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:49,046
<i>if I was capable
of such deception.</i>

903
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:53,293
<i>And I realized
in the end that-</i>

904
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,419
<i>I wasn't.</i>

905
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:03,700
See, you have allowed me
to just be me as well.

906
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,106
I'm Karen Shawnassy.

907
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:12,203
And as of today
I've started a new career.

908
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:16,280
Race car ownership.

909
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:19,446
And, uh, I'd like you
to me my driver.

910
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:45,672
<i>Grazie.</i>

911
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:03,490
<i>Let's go win a race.</i>

912
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:38,791
Wow. Really looks good,
don't you think, ladies?

913
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:41,096
Oh, nice and firm.

914
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:44,969
It's got some miles but that
makes for a smoother ride.

915
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:47,667
<i>And I can't wait
to check that dipstick.</i>

916
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,348
Let's go!
