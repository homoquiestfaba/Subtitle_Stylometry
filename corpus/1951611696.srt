1
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,760
Until something happens...

2
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,760
my plan is to stay in this wonderful bar
of ours and get drunk.

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,800
The locals are torching your flag.

4
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,920
You know, we should film them.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,600
When they burn something interesting
I will hit record.

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,560
- Like the new President?
- Amirev?

7
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,920
Amirev. The question is, will he last?

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
<i>Well, he made it through the first week.</i>

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,280
<i>The people love him
and he won the election fair and square.</i>

10
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,080
<i>Our reluctant loser, Kirilov,
has other plans for Amirev.</i>

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,200
Stop! IDs please.

12
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,640
I'm here to collect Commander Sam Keenan.

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,320
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,440
So, nobody's going to the airport
to pick up your new Ambassador?

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,760
New second-in-command,
Deputy Ambassador...

16
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,600
ain't worth changing shirts for.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
That's not who they're flying in today.

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
I've heard it's the new military attaché.

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,360
<i>Military attaché, interesting></i>

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
<i>You know, word on the street is the militia
with Kirilov are planning a coup.</i>

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,880
Amirev knows that he has
a serious insurgency problem on his hands.

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,320
He also knows that his army
simply isn't up to handling it.

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
Yeah, no shit.

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,040
Which is exactly why
Norland requested this guy.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,680
<i>He's the kind of guy you definitely want
on your team if you're expecting trouble.</i>

26
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,320
<i>And let's face it, the US are taking
this insurgency problem very seriously.</i>

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,760
<i>So, who is he?</i>

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,840
His name is Keenan.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,280
Commander Samuel Keenan. Navy SEAL.

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,440
<i>He's the toughest guy I have ever met.</i>

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,400
- Your bag, sir.
- Thank you.

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,520
- Sounds like you know him.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,560
Michelle and I embedded
with his team in El Basra.

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,760
She however got to know him
a little better than I did.

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Sir.

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,720
<i>Oh, not our super clean
Michelle "United World News" Whitman?</i>

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,160
<i>The very same.</i>

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,360
<i>Delta Four,
requesting clearance for take-off.</i>

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,760
<i>Michelle told me that he's coming
by the hotel before he starts work.</i>

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,760
<i>Lucky Miss Whitman.</i>

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,040
- What's your name, Corporal?
- Butler, sir.

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,640
Do you know the Hotel Continental?

43
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,760
Sir, my orders were to take you
straight to the Embassy, sir.

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,920
Then on to the Presidential Palace.

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,200
But the hotel is kind of on the way.

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
In the opposite direction.

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,440
- Give me an hour, okay?
- Yes, sir.

48
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Who is it?

49
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,400
How are you?

50
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,240
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,960
- Hey, man.
- Journalist scum!

52
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,120
Shit.

53
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,400
Sam.

54
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,920
Hey, buddy, stop.

55
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
- Go home, we don't want you here!
- We're press!

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,040
Foreigner news programs to leave!

57
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
- Out the door!
- I'll follow, I'll follow!

58
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,240
Get out of the way. You, get down.

59
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,680
- Sir, you okay?
- I'm fine.

60
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,880
- Get some ambulances, now.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,120
You, come on, let's get out of here.

62
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,560
Michelle, you better come with me.
You'll be safe at the Embassy.

63
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,800
- I'm a reporter, Sam.
- Like him.

64
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,240
You know where the phone is?
You, answer me.

65
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,480
You want to be next?

66
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,720
If we don't show the world
what's happening, who will?

67
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,640
Sam, you know me well enough by now.

68
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,840
Sir, Civil Guards are on their way.

69
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,720
You should not be here when they arrive.
Let's go.

70
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,760
Stay off the streets
and let me find out what's going on.

71
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,320
Don't worry, Sam, we'll be fine.

72
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Michelle, I'll come back for you.

73
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
Jesus Christ, that's gotta be a bomb.

74
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,200
- What's there?
- It's the army barracks.

75
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,040
This country is supposed to be stable.
They just had elections.

76
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,320
Well, someone didn't like the result.
Move on.

77
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,280
Gunnery Sergeant Darnell.
Commander Sam Keenan.

78
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,760
Gunnery Sergeant.

79
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,160
Gunny will do just fine, sir.

80
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,400
- Nice town, huh?
- Sleepy.

81
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,200
It has its moments. Good to meet you, sir.

82
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,280
Commander Keenan. I'm Jennifer Lennard.

83
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,760
- Nice to meet you.
- Right this way, please.

84
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,520
Ambassador Norland
speaks very highly of you.

85
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,280
George? He's a good man.

86
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,920
I get the feeling this town
is going to need him more than ever.

87
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,440
He's right through here.

88
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Sam, how are you, son?

89
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,480
Ambassador, sorry, I got delayed.

90
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
Our RSO, John Lydon.

91
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,880
Marine Detachment Commander
John Baldwin.

92
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,560
Our new military attaché,
Commander Keenan.

93
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
Welcome to the deep end,
Commander Keenan.

94
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,560
Here's the top sheet.

95
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,720
A small cadre of insurgents, former military
and loyal to ex-president Kirilov...

96
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,120
are stirring up opposition
to the new president.

97
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
This man is their leader, Tavarov...

98
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,760
who obviously ordered the hit
on the journalists' hotel.

99
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,800
They're hardliners,
old school communist, violently anti-US.

100
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,800
But mainly street corner show boaters,
until now.

101
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,960
- Comrade Tavarov.
- It's time, now.

102
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,080
- Luca.
- Sir.

103
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,840
Move in.

104
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,320
You sure you're all right to do this?

105
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,760
Your boyfriend was pretty insistent
that we stay out of trouble.

106
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,400
Well, trouble has a way of finding me.

107
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,080
How do you think I met him
in the first place?

108
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,040
This place is about to blow, you can feel it.
Come on.

109
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,560
Ambassador.

110
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,000
Frank Gaines. CIA Station Chief.

111
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,720
Our new military attaché,
Commander Keenan.

112
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,040
They still call you B.C.?

113
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,880
What do you mean?

114
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,800
Well, you go to a hotel, a half hour later
we have a body count of eight.

115
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,120
- Frank, Sam is on our side.
- So were those dead reporters.

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,640
Now, what's your intel on the gunmen
and the bombers?

117
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,320
Well, we have one major explosion
and three smaller blasts.

118
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,440
My contacts report roving bands of militia,
maybe as many as 500.

119
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,880
They've taken out
the military barracks here...

120
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,320
and the Civil Guard HQ here.

121
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,600
They've shot up US business interests too.

122
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,400
We have unconfirmed American casualties.

123
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,960
What about the rest of the army?

124
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,320
President Amirev sent General Borgov...

125
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,200
to take out what we thought
was a militia base camp.

126
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,200
Satellite pictures show
he's turned back from the mountains...

127
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,840
so I'd say five hours, minimum.

128
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,560
I'll give you three to one on Amirev
swinging from a rope by midnight.

129
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,520
As the capital falls into anarchy...

130
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,040
the rioters have cut the President off
from both his military and police.

131
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,360
Amirev needs his army who are reportedly
hours away in the mountains.

132
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,320
- Yes, Comrade.
- Shoot.

133
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Yes, sir.

134
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
- Where did that come from?
- One of the Palace Guards has opened fire.

135
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,920
- You getting any of this?
- Yeah, all of it.

136
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,440
They're storming the palace.

137
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
"Our palace guards have opened fire
Mr. President."

138
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,000
"On my own people?
Who gave such an order?"

139
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,320
"They are jumpy sir.
It's understandable."

140
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,520
"My army could restore order immediately,
yet they are still hours away."

141
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,680
"But sir, we've lost contact
with General Borgov."

142
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,240
"The airport is open.
I have organized a plane for you."

143
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,800
"A plane?
When all other options are closed?"

144
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,720
"Why does so obvious an escape
remain open to me?"

145
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
"Have Captain Servat come in."

146
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,280
"You must leave now, sir."

147
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,800
"Put my Chief of Staff under arrest."

148
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,360
"Mr. President?"

149
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
"I don't need his advice any longer."

150
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,720
"Mr. President!"

151
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,160
Ambassador Norland, please.

152
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,640
<i>The militia are clearly encouraging
the people to press forward.</i>

153
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,080
How many marines do we have?
How many people do we have to protect?

154
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,280
Officially an Embassy staff of 27.

155
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,280
Plus 42 other US nationals in the city,
mostly oil and telecom engineers.

156
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,680
Marine Embassy Guard detachment of 15.

157
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,680
Fifteen? That's it?

158
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,920
This was not considered
a hazardous duty station.

159
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,240
- Look outside, Mr. Gaines.
- I know.

160
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,960
That was President Amirev.

161
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,200
Communists are storming
the Presidential Palace.

162
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,080
- And?
- He wants our help.

163
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,560
So, tell him people in hell want ice cubes.

164
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,520
How many weapons and transport
do we have?

165
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,760
Whoa, hold on a second there, B.C.

166
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,040
I see where you're going with this.
It's not going to happen.

167
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,400
Sir, the Secretary of State
would have our asses.

168
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,560
If we're gonna do something,
we're better to move now.

169
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
- Yeah, yeah, well, with all due respect...
- Hear him out, Gaines.

170
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,760
Those marines see any action?

171
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,360
Gunny, Butler, and Zanger
all spent a tour in Iraq.

172
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,800
Works for me. Get me in, I'll get him out.

173
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,120
Do it.

174
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,760
Follow me.

175
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,080
Sam.

176
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,080
Since we still haven't replaced
my former deputy...

177
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm appointing you
to temporarily fill the slot.

178
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,920
You're my new second-in-command.

179
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,400
Less protesters back here.

180
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
- It's fully loaded, sir.
- Thank you.

181
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,880
Pull up here,
I should be able to go this way.

182
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,080
Service entrance to the palace.

183
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,600
Shit, those Palace Guards
look like they've got their hands full.

184
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,640
Make sure they keep holding.

185
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,680
There's Sam.

186
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,920
You're the gentleman
who will assist my travel?

187
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,360
Yes, sir. Where is your driver?

188
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,880
Follow me.

189
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,400
<i>Sam, we've got a problem.</i>

190
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,600
Mobs coming through. They're storming
through the service office door.

191
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,880
Switching to Plan "B."

192
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,800
Follow me.

193
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,960
Baldwin, cover us when we come out.

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
<i>Copy, Sam, we're right behind you.</i>

195
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,440
We've got movement.

196
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,480
With just a handful of guards
protecting the palace...

197
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,240
and his most loyal generals
many hours away...

198
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,480
the feeling in the insurgents
is one of "now or never."

199
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,240
God, Sam!

200
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,360
Keep your head down, sir.

201
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,040
Let's get out of here.

202
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,720
Yeah, we're out of here.

203
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,800
Tavarov.

204
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,080
<i>Cover the US Embassy.</i>

205
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,600
<i>This is Tiger One, we got your back here.</i>

206
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,360
<i>Let's roll back to the Embassy, sir.</i>

207
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,040
Copy that. Hang back and cover our flank.

208
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,040
<i>- Gunny, we're coming in. Cover us.
- Roger, Sam. Ready to deploy.</i>

209
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,000
Watch it, we're cut off.

210
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
<i>I got the rear, Sam.</i>

211
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,520
Hold on, sir, I'll get you out.

212
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,880
Brace yourself.

213
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,000
I got it, go!

214
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,040
Move out, cover the street!

215
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,160
Pazzini, cover me!

216
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,600
- Take him out!
- I've got it, go!

217
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,320
Get up on the wall.

218
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,400
Coming in from the left.

219
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,000
Coming around, move!

220
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,280
- Mr. President, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

221
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,400
Okay, come on.

222
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,880
Sir, we'll have to make a run for it, okay?

223
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,240
Grenade, give me your grenade!

224
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
Go, get the hell out of here.

225
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Only shoot on my orders!

226
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,160
Follow me. Go, go! Cover!

227
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,760
Fire! Fire!

228
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,720
Get those goddamn gates open!

229
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,520
Over here!

230
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,080
Incoming fire! Get down!

231
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,240
Close the gates!

232
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,440
They're pulling back.

233
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,320
Welcome to the USA, Mr. President.

234
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
Thank you. I am in your debt.

235
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,560
Sir, the Ambassador is waiting inside.

236
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,000
Sir.

237
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,040
Corporal Zanger just radioed in.
He and Pazzini are still out there.

238
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,160
I'll assemble a reaction team
and bring them both in.

239
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,640
Negative, Gunny.

240
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,680
The city is crawling with militia
heading in our direction.

241
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,280
I need all available men right now.

242
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,280
Zanger and Pazzini are two of my best.

243
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,600
I'm sure they are, and they're marines.

244
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,600
- I'm counting on them out there.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,400
Jones, left flank, Red, right flank!

246
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,800
Move!

247
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,360
Hold your position.

248
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,520
<i>Attention, please, all civilian evacuees...</i>

249
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,680
<i>please assemble in the lobby
for a security briefing.</i>

250
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,960
- Here you go.
- Hi.

251
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,160
- Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
- Are you sure?

252
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,400
Hell of a time for a tour group.

253
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,200
They're US nationals who work in the city.
We bussed them in for their own safety.

254
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,440
We need to get control of our defenses.
Is there a map of this place?

255
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,680
Yeah, the Marine Unit
is down the hall and to the left.

256
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,720
ACR is in the basement through Comms.

257
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,240
Come with me,
I'll show you the Embassy plans.

258
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,160
<i>Would evacuees please remain in the lobby
and await further instructions.</i>

259
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,560
They re-grouped
at the top of the street, Gunny.

260
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,560
Enough ammo to hold off
a troop of girl scouts.

261
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,400
Yeah, and the only anti-personnel weapon
we've got is bad breath.

262
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,800
I've spotted an RPG.

263
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,640
I'll give the Ambassador the great news.

264
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,680
Now, we do this the hard way.

265
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,240
We don't have much time.

266
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,760
<i>Let us know immediately
if there's any change in your plans.</i>

267
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,480
- Incoming!
- Get down!

268
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,920
- You okay?
- Yeah.

269
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,280
- Call for backup, seal the windows.
- Right, sir.

270
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,880
You two, on me!

271
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,480
Get him downstairs into the bubble, now!

272
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
You okay?

273
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,400
Norland!

274
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,760
Norland. Fuck, Norland.

275
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,040
What, Sam?

276
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,640
Medic! Medic! Please, here.

277
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,240
Please, what's the damage?

278
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
They hit us with RPGs.

279
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,240
- Let me take a look at you.
- No.

280
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,000
You're gonna be okay. Hold on.

281
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,920
I don't think I'm going to make it.

282
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,240
Best to leave this in.

283
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,840
Amirev is inside the bubble.
He's safe. For now.

284
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,400
Sir, this is Marshall Geller at Comms Tech.

285
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,880
- Hey, Marshall.
- Sir.

286
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,960
How is the President?

287
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,240
...any background information,
anything you know.

288
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,360
He's good.

289
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,280
White House situation room, you're on.
Ready, sir.

290
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,840
This is Sam Keenan.

291
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,760
I regret to inform you
that Ambassador Norland has been...

292
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,320
<i>killed in the Embassy attack.</i>

293
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,680
Richard Hammond, Secretary of State.

294
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Our sympathies, Commander Keenan.
How did this happen?

295
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,400
<i>A coup d'etat is in progress.</i>

296
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Amirev is in the Embassy
and we've been hit with an RPG.

297
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
John Franklin, NSA.

298
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,080
<i>How is your security?</i>

299
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,520
We are surrounded by militia
loyal to Kirilov. I need backup.

300
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
<i>This is General Anderson.</i>

301
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
Our nearest Marine Expeditionary Unit...

302
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,760
<i>is about six hours due east
of your current position.</i>

303
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,760
You folks are just gonna have
to do whatever you can...

304
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,920
to hold the fort until they can arrive.

305
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,040
Understood.

306
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,360
And if you don't mind sir, on the double.

307
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,840
Copy that.

308
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,040
<i>Commander Keenan...</i>

309
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,320
we'll keep the lines open for you
here at State...

310
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,320
the Pentagon and Ops Center CIA.

311
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,480
Let us know immediately if there's
any change in your plans, or your situation.

312
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,680
Good luck.

313
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,800
This is General Anderson.

314
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,360
I'm issuing orders
for the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.

315
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,960
To proceed with an emergency
Embassy Reinforcement Mission.

316
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,840
O'Brien, check the message.

317
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,440
Message relayed.

318
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,320
<i>This is Fort Victory.
Message received and understood, over.</i>

319
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,120
Go, go, go! Move, move, move! Scramble!

320
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,000
Move your ass! Move your ass!

321
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,360
<i>We're ready to go.</i>

322
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,560
<i>Delta 11, ready.</i>

323
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,200
<i>The birds are in the air.</i>

324
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,280
<i>Delta 13, birds are flying.</i>

325
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,200
<i>All right, boys.
Sit tight, you've got a long ride.</i>

326
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,480
Raise your hand if you feel confident
about our security.

327
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,360
What we do have is an E&E plan.

328
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,000
You heard my discussion
with the Secretary of State.

329
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,160
Case closed.

330
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,840
Evacuation is our only option.

331
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,120
The longer we delay the harder it'll become.

332
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,960
The evacuation plan
was designed for a staff of 15.

333
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,640
We have over 50 people here.

334
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,480
And a full on siege outside.

335
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
How long do we have until
General Borgov returns with his troops?

336
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,800
About four hours.

337
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,360
By then we'll have militia
trying on our pants for size.

338
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,480
Ambassador Norland said he would not
let this fragile democracy fail.

339
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,520
I'm not going to let him down.

340
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,280
We hold the fort.

341
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,840
I hate to piss on your little parade, Keenan...

342
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,520
but Norland is dead.

343
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,440
Jesus, am I the only one here...

344
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,760
who thinks life would be rosier
on the other side of that mob?

345
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,520
Evac is not an option.

346
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,640
Vietnam is history, pal, get over it.

347
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,520
Frank, you're not being helpful.

348
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,720
Helpful is not sacrificing
more American lives...

349
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,640
in a hopeless situation, John.

350
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,200
This guy has been
in country less than a day.

351
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,000
What does he know?

352
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,200
<i>Sir, you'd better come to the TCU.</i>

353
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,480
On my way.

354
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,520
- They broke in on Channel 4.
- How?

355
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,800
Don't know, he won't talk to me.
He just wants the man in charge.

356
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,560
This is Sam Keenan. Over.

357
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,480
I said I only want to speak to man in charge.
The Ambassador.

358
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,560
He was killed. I'm in charge.

359
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,760
My name is Tavarov.

360
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,960
I represent
the Revolutionary People's Government.

361
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,720
We demand the release
of President Yuri Amirev.

362
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,080
To stand a trial for the murder
of innocent civilians.

363
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,720
Gunned down on his order
outside the palace.

364
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,760
<i>Over.</i>

365
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,480
Amirev is under our protection,
which is US soil.

366
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,480
If he did commit those crimes,
there are proper and legal ways to proceed.

367
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,200
Not at the point of a gun.
That's how it works in a democracy.

368
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,240
<i>Over.</i>

369
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,280
We have demanded the release
of President Amirev.

370
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,080
Look outside, Mr. Keenan.

371
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,960
<i>In front of your gate.</i>

372
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,680
Shit. The roof.

373
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,920
You got a minute, John?

374
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,000
Why did the Vietnam reference
get him so riled?

375
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,280
He was born there.

376
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,200
His mother was part
of the French Diplomatic Mission.

377
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,360
His old man was some jarhead officer...

378
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,400
who bought a bullet
when we pulled out of Saigon.

379
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,200
- No wonder he's not big on evac.
- No. But he's big on ego.

380
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,720
This guy is a loose cannon.

381
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,160
<i>We just went from George Norland
to George of the Jungle.</i>

382
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,840
I'm going back channel on this.

383
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,520
You might consider doing the same thing.

384
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,640
If you wanna save this place
and everybody in it.

385
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,200
Out! Get out!

386
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,720
Get out!

387
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,840
Redwood Two, we got three hostages
including one woman...

388
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,720
being held at gunpoint. Over.

389
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,880
Yeah, that's General Illienev.

390
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,400
Other guy looks like press.

391
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,520
- And that woman.
- Michelle.

392
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,920
- Michelle Whitman.
- Of course it is.

393
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,640
- United World News.
- Yeah.

394
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,120
Mr. Tavarov, if we are going to talk...

395
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,840
release the hostages now.

396
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,880
Our demands are clear.

397
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,600
Release President Amirev into our custody.

398
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,600
Or these people will be executed.

399
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,320
Can I remind you, the Geneva Convention,
about prisoners of war?

400
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,200
Unless I am mistaken, we are not at war.

401
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,680
The hostages are innocent civilians.

402
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,480
Then release our President.

403
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,360
It's very simple.

404
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
He's not fucking around.

405
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Our position on that is clear, Mr. Tavarov.

406
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,040
Over.

407
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,760
You have 15 minutes.

408
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,200
Then we will kill them both.

409
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,880
<i>Then you are next, Mr. Keenan.
You and everyone inside the Embassy.</i>

410
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,560
<i>We are taking our country back.
How we do it, it is up to you.</i>

411
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,000
We have no choice.

412
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,320
You read my mind, sir.

413
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,600
I'm going to have to park
those thoughts about Beyoncé.

414
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,000
- What are you thinking, Keenan?
- We're going out there for a rescue.

415
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,920
Gunny, what have we got?

416
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,680
We got two Recon Marines,
two trained snipers.

417
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,400
If we can create a diversion,
we can get those hostages back.

418
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,120
- You don't have anything big enough.
- You're right. Two men in the field.

419
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
The best they can do is to draw fire.

420
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,240
I know it hurts to agree with me,
but let me finish.

421
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,720
You don't have anything big enough,
but I do.

422
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,080
A little insurance policy I've been hiding
by the name of Charlie Four.

423
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,320
<i>Tiger One, this is Redwood One. Come in.</i>

424
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,240
Tiger One. Over.

425
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,960
<i>- What's your location?
- Baktiar Street.</i>

426
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,760
- Are you mobile?
- Just four legs between us.

427
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Okay, gentlemen.

428
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,040
<i>There is a bicycle store on Plechia Street,
which is two blocks east.</i>

429
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,560
Okay, we'll find it.

430
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,440
The owner is gonna ask your name.
Tell him, "Michael Jordan."

431
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,120
Call us when you're inside,
and guys, haul ass.

432
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,920
Okay, let's move.

433
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,920
Sir...

434
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,320
a man calling himself Tavarov
just killed a hostage.

435
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,800
More hostages will be killed
unless I turn you over.

436
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,840
- I need a straight answer.
- Please.

437
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,920
Did you order your guards
to shoot at the people at your palace?

438
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,760
No. Let me explain something.

439
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,040
These men are brutal.

440
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,960
We fought against them, 10 years.

441
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,000
<i>Suffered their abuses for more than 20.</i>

442
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,640
If I thought surrendering myself
to them would stop the bloodshed...

443
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,160
I would do it.

444
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,160
But the opposite is true.

445
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,760
Only by defying them
can I protect my people.

446
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,360
I'm very sorry you're caught in the middle,
Mr. Keenan.

447
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,520
Whatever you decide, I will understand.

448
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,760
- Thank you.
- My army is coming.

449
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,520
<i>This is General Borgov's 18th battalion
en route to the American Embassy.</i>

450
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,520
<i>Our ETA will be in four hours. Do you copy?</i>

451
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,440
<i>This is General Borgov's 18th battalion
en route to the American Embassy.</i>

452
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,360
<i>Our ETA will be four hours. Over.</i>

453
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,400
Hi, Michael Jordan.

454
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,640
- Good to meet you. Follow me.
- Okay.

455
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,000
You got the radio?

456
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,480
Here's the C4.

457
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,120
Great, thanks. All right.

458
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,120
Watch our backs.
You squawk twice if there's a problem.

459
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,960
If we're being followed,
you're found, whatever.

460
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,200
- Understand.
- Okay.

461
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,280
Let's get this thing on the road.

462
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,960
<i>Bike is in position.</i>

463
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,160
Tiger One. All set. Over.

464
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,280
<i>Redwood One.</i>

465
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,560
Copy. All set.

466
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,080
On my command.

467
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,000
Three, two, one, go.

468
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,320
Cover! Cover!

469
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,200
Move!

470
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,200
Go, go, go!

471
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,120
Go, go! Get the hostages! Get down!

472
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,960
Move out!

473
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,480
Quick, move!

474
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,800
Come on, guys! Let's go!

475
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,200
Hustle! Man down! Come on!

476
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,520
Get him up. Come on.

477
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Let's move them out, come on!
Let's move it!

478
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,440
Come on, hurry up!

479
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,600
Quick!

480
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,200
Here! Need some help here!

481
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,080
- Medic!
- Medic!

482
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,640
There's a man still out there, sir.

483
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
Sir.

484
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
Come on, Mateo, let's go.

485
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,120
Come on. I think we can make it back.

486
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,600
Close the door.

487
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,320
Get the medics in reception. We got injured.

488
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,600
- You all right, sir?
- Oh, God, my leg.

489
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,480
- You'll be fine.
- I need morphine.

490
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,560
- Are you okay?
- Take it easy, take it easy.

491
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,400
- Baldwin, get the medics.
- Sir.

492
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,800
And secure the compound.

493
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,640
- Keep on holding, Mateo.
- Move!

494
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,080
Suck it up.

495
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,280
It's great to have you back barking orders...

496
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,360
but we need intel
faster than they need a Band-Aid.

497
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,680
- You two are reporters, right?
- Yeah.

498
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,880
How many troops did they bring
to the palace?

499
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,160
Fifty, a hundred, I have no idea.

500
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,400
We were filming and then they came after us
and we just ran.

501
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,880
And the rest of the Civic Guard?

502
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,200
There were these men arriving in trucks
carrying AK-47 s and they fired at them.

503
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,360
- You recognize firearms?
- Research is part of my job.

504
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,200
Okay, good.
What other equipment did you see?

505
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,760
- Did they have tanks?
- No tanks.

506
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,600
- Any heavy armory?
- No. We just saw trucks.

507
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,280
What about the leader, Tavarov?
Did he try to hurt you?

508
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,840
Did he say he planned to shoot you?

509
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,440
No. The opposite.
He said he would be happy to release us.

510
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,080
I want to see both of you in my office
when you're finished.

511
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,520
Gunny.

512
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,760
What's General Borgov's position?

513
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,800
He's still 120 miles away.

514
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,520
With heavy armor, I'd say,
three and a half hours.

515
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,600
They're still mopping up the dead out there.

516
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,880
Corporal Chevanton puts their casualties
at 25 dead, 12 wounded.

517
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,440
That will not stop Tavarov.

518
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,240
No, he'll know help is on its way.
It's just going to speed things up.

519
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,320
He'll hit us with everything they've got.

520
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,160
Unless we give them what they want.

521
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,640
- Gunny?
- Sure.

522
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,280
I'll give them what they want.
So long as they want hell.

523
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,880
Marine's balls for frigging brains.

524
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,680
Hey, we got the hostages back, didn't we?

525
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,800
Keenan.

526
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,200
Your mandate here
is not to turn this into the Alamo.

527
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,600
Great movie.

528
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,960
Sure. But everybody died.

529
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,840
We got Texas, didn't we?

530
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,720
Sir, we've got movement.

531
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,000
Yes, we have all that under control now.
Yeah.

532
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,000
Can you guys...

533
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,080
Incoming!

534
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,520
<i>Post Five has been hit.
They got the comms array.</i>

535
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,320
- The comms are out.
- We need to update Washington.

536
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,560
See if they can give us something else.
Come on, move.

537
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,360
- I'll have to rig the Satphone.
- Let's go.

538
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,360
Just be a minute.

539
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,640
Got a lock.

540
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,800
Washington. Do you copy? Over.

541
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,040
<i>This is General Anderson. Copy that.</i>

542
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,920
Yeah. Patch me through
to the Secretary of State.

543
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,560
<i>This is Secretary Hammond.</i>

544
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,000
What is your current situation? Over.

545
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,960
Sir, militia forces destroyed
our communication center.

546
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,280
Sir, Mr. Secretary, this is Frank Gaines, CIA.

547
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,440
We are outnumbered by over 20 to 1
at the moment.

548
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,200
We have no cover on three sides...

549
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,960
and the militia may have seized
government tanks and heavy weapons.

550
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,200
- Yeah, but...
- Sir, with relief forces still hours away...

551
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,440
and General Borgov's army out of contact...

552
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,360
I strongly urge that we reconsider
the plan to evacuate...

553
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,280
and take advantage of imminent night cover.

554
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,560
That's an opinion
which I cannot support, sir.

555
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,720
Would you stand by for a moment,
Commander Keenan?

556
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,160
Sir, I think you should take a look at this.

557
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,400
Gentlemen, we have a problem here.

558
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,560
Commander Keenan.

559
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,640
<i>This department has not received
official notification...</i>

560
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,000
that you've replaced Captain Baldwin
as acting Deputy Chief of Mission. Over.

561
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,400
I'm not getting you, sir.

562
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,040
<i>The cable replacing Captain Baldwin...</i>

563
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,600
<i>as acting Deputy Chief of Mission
was never sent.</i>

564
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,360
Officially, he is in charge, not you.

565
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,240
I am hereby ordering you to assist him...

566
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,760
<i>in any way you can.</i>

567
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,640
<i>Could you put Captain Baldwin on the line?</i>

568
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,760
This is Captain Baldwin.

569
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,240
What is your assessment
of the merits of an E&E?

570
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,760
I cannot guarantee the safety
of anyone in this facility.

571
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,480
I would therefore agree
that evacuation would be advisable.

572
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,040
Captain Baldwin,
you are authorized to proceed.

573
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,520
<i>This is Delta 13, we are en route
and ETA is three hours. Over.</i>

574
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,440
I heard the staff talking.

575
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,560
- And?
- They say we're moving out.

576
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,320
Is that so?

577
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,520
Sam, if we stay, we're dead.

578
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,920
If we go, we're ducks in a shooting gallery.

579
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,720
Well, it's Baldwin's call now.

580
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,080
Michelle, Baldwin is a good guy.

581
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,440
But he's never been in a combat situation.

582
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,920
But this is his turf.

583
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,040
This is your life.

584
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,880
Does it ever occur to you
that you might be wrong?

585
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,440
Not this time.

586
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,720
You know, it's okay to run
when you have explored all the options.

587
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,080
We'll talk about this later.

588
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,920
I tried to warn you.

589
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,800
We don't have time to build a horse
or dig a tunnel.

590
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,280
We don't have to. Someone already did.

591
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,680
Talk to me.

592
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,720
Now, here's a little something for you.

593
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,520
What is it?

594
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,960
Paranoid bastards built all kinds of shit
under the city.

595
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,200
Bomb shelters, command posts.

596
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,960
More tunnels than the New York subway.

597
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,320
That's lucky for us.

598
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,400
All stations.

599
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,880
<i>Harry is open. Over.</i>

600
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,280
Birch One to all staff. Initiate final burn.

601
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,720
Just the sensitive stuff. Bag it all.
Burn it to the furnace.

602
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,920
<i>Attention all personnel. Please
make your way to the first floor lobby...</i>

603
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,640
<i>- and prepare for immediate evacuation.
- And then they told me the situation...</i>

604
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,960
All quiet up here.

605
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,320
Stop there.

606
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,240
Tiger One. Transport ETA.

607
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,160
Tiger Two, ready. Out.

608
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,080
Tiger One,
tunnel exit located and secure. Over.

609
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,240
Just keep it moving.

610
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,520
Hey, folks, about a quarter mile
till we reach open air.

611
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,920
Stay tight.

612
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,480
Come on, let's go.

613
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,920
Look, I'll give you the details
of the evac plan...

614
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,560
when we're on the bus and out of the city.

615
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,480
So, if you could just take your place in line.

616
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,960
I'm staying.

617
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,160
That would be contradicting a direct order
from the Secretary of State.

618
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,480
Tavarov will want a point of contact
inside the embassy.

619
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,440
Let it go, Keenan.
Face it, pal, you just weren't up to the job.

620
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,480
<i>Redwood Two. The men are briefed
for a tactical withdrawal. Out.</i>

621
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,640
Birch One. Copy that.

622
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,120
Suit yourself, tough guy.

623
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,720
It'll be all right.

624
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,040
This way.

625
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,600
There are two more coming through. Over.

626
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,160
Tavarov's men are still gathering out front.

627
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,880
Right. By the time he's inside,
we'll have a half-hour head start.

628
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,560
I'll just divert the Marine Expeditionary Units
to the new away point...

629
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,160
and then we chopper out the civilians.
Simple.

630
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,320
You made the right decision.

631
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,920
Yeah.

632
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,440
Redwood Two.
Clarify status, Tiger One. Over.

633
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,840
Sir.

634
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,080
This way. Keep moving, please.

635
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,040
If you boys go AWOL again...

636
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm gonna kick your ass.

637
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,160
Yeah, you get stuck in a hole again,
I ain't gonna save your sorry ass.

638
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,520
Follow me.

639
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,920
Let's go.

640
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,080
Redwood Two.
Clarify status, Tiger One. Over.

641
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,960
<i>Tiger One. Hatch is open. Over.</i>

642
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,560
Come on.

643
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,080
There it is.

644
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,160
Redwood Two.
Go, go, go. Stay low, stay low.

645
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
All right, let's get up there and cover.

646
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,840
Come on.

647
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,080
Nice work. Let's get them on the bus.

648
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,680
Go, go.

649
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,960
Redwood Two. Clarify status...

650
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,320
<i>- Tiger One. Over.
- Almost there, sir.</i>

651
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,160
<i>This is Birch One.
President is en route. Over.</i>

652
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,440
Why don't you attack this Embassy?

653
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,040
What are you waiting for?

654
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,000
Okay. Holding.

655
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,360
Better, better way.

656
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,640
It's not right.

657
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,080
Shit!

658
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,840
What are you doing?

659
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,800
Shit.

660
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,840
Retreat! All back to the Embassy. Go!

661
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,160
Michelle!

662
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,520
Move out!

663
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,440
We've been set up. We've been set up!

664
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,800
Hey, guys! Guys!

665
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,960
Get them out of here!

666
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,280
Move! Go, go!

667
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
- Sir, they knew we were coming.
- Come on.

668
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,880
Let's move inside.

669
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,040
Back inside.

670
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,520
Go. Let's go!

671
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,600
Move, move, move!

672
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,080
Come on, guys, let's go.

673
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,560
Get the people to the TCU
and the President to the ACR.

674
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,320
- Now. Come on, move.
- Let's go.

675
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,800
Where's Michelle?

676
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,000
- Where's Michelle?
- She's still in the tunnel, I think.

677
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,240
Keenan, don't. It's too late.
Leave it, they're gone.

678
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,560
I want this Embassy combat ready
in 15 minutes.

679
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,760
You're not in command anymore!

680
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,880
We're talking about lives here.

681
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,440
- Give me five minutes, then seal the tunnel.
- Yes, sir.

682
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,800
Don't wait for me.

683
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,240
Michelle.

684
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,160
Sam.

685
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,840
Stay down.

686
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,440
I'll take you out of here.

687
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,600
- Seal the tunnel.
- Yes, sir.

688
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,160
Fire in the hole!

689
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,200
Geller is dead.

690
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,400
The Satphone's out. We're cut off.

691
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,240
They knew we were coming. They had to.

692
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,440
- Did we scan everybody?
- Everyone who passes the security post.

693
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,400
But it wasn't manned.

694
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,920
<i>Amirev. He's still alive, sir.</i>

695
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,600
<i>This is Delta 13, we are en route.
ETA is one hour. Over.</i>

696
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,960
- Mr. President.
- Sir.

697
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,760
We believe the militia may have planted
a listening device on someone.

698
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,920
They made sure it was someone
who made it inside.

699
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,000
Check my men, please.

700
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,880
Clean.

701
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,960
Sir, is there any chance...

702
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,560
that someone in your office
could have planted one on you?

703
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,280
Anything is possible.

704
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,920
- Do you mind?
- Please.

705
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,480
Nothing.

706
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,960
So, that's everyone.

707
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,440
No. Not everyone.

708
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,280
Deactivated. It's one of ours.

709
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,400
Tavarov has heard everything
within 10 feet of you.

710
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,800
How's your head?

711
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,560
Mild concussion.

712
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,720
Sam, I...

713
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,880
Sometimes, life forces you
to make a tough call, Michelle.

714
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,960
But those people...

715
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,240
Those poor people.

716
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,120
I know.

717
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,560
That's history.

718
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,440
Maybe it sounds cold, but that's history.

719
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,680
You have to survive to write about it, okay?

720
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,240
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

721
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,640
Michelle, they'll come at us
with everything they've got.

722
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,800
I need to handle this.

723
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,480
Eight marines left.

724
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,360
- How's the morale holding up?
- We've got 10 motivated bad-asses, Gunny...

725
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,760
just itching to bring a world of pain
to these motherfuckers.

726
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,200
Copy that.

727
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,400
Time to get down and dirty.
Keenan wants claymores.

728
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,000
You get a staffer to pass these around.
I want metal...

729
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,880
keys, coins, knives, nails and I want them
back here, full, in five minutes.

730
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,160
Yes, sir.

731
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,520
You were looking for me?

732
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,880
Sir, I feel I should be relieved
of my command.

733
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,400
Officially I don't work here, remember?

734
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,600
We've got Tavarov. On four.

735
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,560
You take it. As far as he and I are concerned
you're in charge here.

736
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,880
<i>- Sam Keenan.
- Mr. Keenan.</i>

737
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,080
You can end this with no further loss
on either side.

738
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,480
Release President Amirev now...

739
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,160
and your people
will leave our country unharmed.

740
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,040
The marines and a shit load of tanks
are heading your way.

741
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,200
<i>Over.</i>

742
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,040
When they get here,
they will be dealing with a new government.

743
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,120
Out.

744
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,840
- Baldwin, are the civilians in the basement?
- Yes, sir.

745
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,960
How are we looking?

746
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,560
Bad news, sir. Our perimeter's full of holes.

747
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,920
- And the good news?
- The good news?

748
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,240
We gonna teach these mothers
a whole new meaning of pain.

749
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,960
Give them hell, Gunny. That's an order.

750
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,280
Yes, sir.

751
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,000
Happy 4th of July, gentlemen.

752
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,440
I suggest you make full use
of the right to bear arms.

753
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,720
Got to love that Second Amendment.

754
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,000
- What you doing here?
- Sightseeing.

755
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,040
Michelle, go to the basement.

756
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,840
I would, but Mike said he can't find
a decent camera angle down there.

757
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,320
Yeah, that, and the lighting sucks.

758
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,520
Intelligent, beautiful, stubborn.

759
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,960
Nice mix.

760
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,960
<i>Sir, should we wait?</i>

761
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,360
No. Attack.

762
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,000
Redwood One to Redwood Two.

763
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,880
They're positioning to attack. Get ready.

764
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,000
Copy that.

765
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,120
At code Baker, followed by your number,
hold your fire.

766
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,080
<i>We lure them into the open area...</i>

767
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,080
<i>at which point I will give them
their motherfucking bonus.</i>

768
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,600
<i>And we all open up
with everything we've got. Over.</i>

769
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,720
Over.

770
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,600
Here we go!

771
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,000
Come on, hurry, hurry. This way. Quicker.

772
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,320
- Go, go.
- Come on, keep moving.

773
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,320
Come on, move.
Get everyone in the corner over here.

774
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,800
General Borgov is on the secure channel.

775
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,800
Baker Three, Baker Five, Baker Seven.

776
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,800
We're getting in deep. Stand down.

777
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,160
<i>Tavarov, this is General Borgov.</i>

778
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,440
<i>We are nearing your position,
and I am ordering you to stand down.</i>

779
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,040
The Army's back.

780
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,400
Withdraw now.

781
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,000
Move back, move back!

782
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,040
Mr. Keenan. Your cavalry has arrived.

783
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,960
<i>You are lucky.</i>

784
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,280
<i>Baker Six, Baker Six. There is a cease-fire.</i>

785
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,880
<i>Militia is falling back.
I repeat, militia is falling back.</i>

786
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,360
Binoculars.

787
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,000
General Borgov's regiment. They made it.

788
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,200
Congratulations to your brave marines.

789
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,280
At last, I can release you of this burden,
and return to the Presidential Palace.

790
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,800
General Borgov is a personal contact.

791
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:50,920
It would be a great honor, Mr. President,
if I could take his report first hand.

792
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,840
- Very well.
- Thank you.

793
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,840
John, I sense a juicy photo op coming up.

794
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,240
Redwood One? Tell your girlfriend
to get her cameras fired up.

795
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,680
<i>Over.</i>

796
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,440
Copy that.

797
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,920
In the nick of time, General.

798
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,400
- Good to see you again.
- Thank you for coming, sir.

799
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,960
This is Birch One.
Militia forces have cut and run.

800
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,840
The Government Square is secured.

801
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,560
Please tell President Amirev
his people await his return.

802
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,040
<i>- Out.
- Yes!</i>

803
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,840
Oh, shit.

804
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,640
Redwood Three. Return to compound.

805
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,680
The Army's in on this. Fall back, fall back!

806
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,160
Get down!

807
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,480
Move.

808
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,000
Get the President back into the bubble.
Now.

809
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,600
Come on.

810
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,080
<i>Anaconda Six to US Embassy.
Do you read me? Over.</i>

811
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,560
This is Redwood One, say again.
I do not read you. Over.

812
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,880
<i>Anaconda Six. Do you read me?
What's your sit-rep? Over.</i>

813
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,880
We've got tanks in front of the Embassy,
pounding the crap out of us.

814
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,880
<i>Copy that. Will return the favor.</i>

815
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,920
<i>This is the United States Army.</i>

816
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,720
<i>Stand down, lower your weapons,
or you will be fired upon.</i>

817
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,160
Go.

818
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:48,840
Here.

819
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,000
I'm out.

820
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,640
Get out of here!

821
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,840
Sir.

822
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,600
Where's Sam?

823
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,320
Don't think about it.

824
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,040
Do it.

825
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,560
- Seal this room, soldier.
- Yes, sir.

826
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,080
- Keep everybody over the other side, now.
- Okay.

827
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Sir, Miss Whitman's not in the TCU.

828
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,360
Here!

829
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,320
Private, bring that stretcher.

830
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,000
Move!

831
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:56,960
Medic!

832
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,600
Come on.

833
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,040
We need some help here.

834
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,880
Thank you.

835
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,800
Right this way, sir.

836
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,480
- Marine, who's in charge here?
- He is, sir.

837
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,120
Commander Keenan. Sit, sir, sit.

838
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,960
Let's get these civilians out of here.

839
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,760
- Go for it, Colonel.
- Aren't you coming with us?

840
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,560
That's a no.

841
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,280
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

842
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,440
I'm not going anywhere.

843
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,800
Sir.
