00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:36,488
Hello, there.

3
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:35,098
Ohh.

4
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:36,266
Unh.

5
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,192
Tigger! Are you ready
for the hive yet?

6
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:48,570
All I am is ready.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

7
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:49,779
How do I look? Hoo hoo.

8
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:52,365
I mean, uh, does this log
make me look fat?

9
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,788
Ohh. Like the best honey tree
that a bee will ever see. Ha.

10
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:01,166
- Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
- Oh, boy.

11
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,671
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

12
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:17,098
Rabbit, what are you doing?

13
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:18,600
Oh, can't you tell?

14
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:22,479
I'm lullabying the bees
for our big plan.

15
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,069
They seem to like Bee-thoven.

16
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:33,573
Eeyore, what are you doing?

17
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:36,701
I got to use my big voice...

18
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:40,080
to tell the bees
about the new hive.

19
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,084
Buzz, buzz. Great new hive.

20
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,170
Tigger, could you tell me
what you're doing?

21
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,882
I have to hold the fake hive
hive enough for the bees to see.

22
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,677
It's the biggest part
of the plan. Hoo.

23
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:56,471
That's what Tiggers do best.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.

24
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,474
You do seem bigger than usual.

25
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:01,893
Oh, hello, Piglet.

26
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:04,479
Pooh, what are you all doing?

27
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,398
Harvesting honey, of course.

28
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:08,567
<i>It's all in the plan.</i>

29
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:15,073
<i>First, Rabbit will lure
the bees with beautiful music.</i>

30
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:20,078
<i>Then Eeyore tempts the bees
into their new hive.</i>

31
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:24,666
<i>Then Tigger holds up the hive
for the bees to see.</i>

32
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,169
<i>And then comes the best part.</i>

33
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:30,463
<i>We get honey
from their old hive. Ha ha.</i>

34
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:33,592
Can I help you
with your big plan?

35
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:36,678
Well, thank you, Piglet,
but, um, perhaps another time.

36
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:38,972
When we have
a bit smaller of a plan...

37
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:41,766
or when you're
a bit bigger of a Piglet.

38
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:44,477
I'm sorry, Piglet...

39
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:47,689
<i>but I'm afraid
this is a very big plan.</i>

40
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,364
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

41
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,366
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

42
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:02,996
Places, everyone.

43
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,998
I've gotten their attention.

44
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,878
Oh! Aah!

45
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:12,380
Great new hive.

46
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:14,883
Free rent. Buzz, buzz.

47
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:17,385
Oh, do the bees know the plan?

48
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:20,764
Piglet, don't get
in the way of our big plan.

49
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:23,683
I'm getting kind of
itchy around my leaves.

50
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,894
Oh, d-d-dear!

51
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,564
- Oh, buzz.
- Oh!

52
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:34,402
Get the little guy.

53
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:40,200
Oh!

54
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:41,368
<i>Aha!</i>

55
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,872
Ohh!

56
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:55,882
Ohh.

57
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,092
OK, Rabbit.

58
00:04:58,385 --> 00:04:59,761
We're geniuses.

59
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,765
Sticky geniuses.

60
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:06,393
Oh, my. Oh, my.

61
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,186
Oh, goodness.

62
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,564
Oh, the sweet taste of success.

63
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:12,065
Mm-mmm.

64
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,276
Our plan worked perfectly.

65
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:18,071
Didn't think it would work...

66
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:19,364
but it did.

67
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,367
Congratulations to us all.

68
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,287
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Hooray for Pooh!

69
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,789
- And Rabbit.
- And Eeyore.

70
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,583
And Tigger, too.

71
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,293
But--but I was the...

72
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,669
Oh, Piglet...

73
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:36,381
I'm sorry that you couldn't be
part of our big plan.

74
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:39,467
Oh, but I thought I...

75
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:43,763
For a minute there, I thought
I was gonna break out in hives.

76
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:53,273
Oh, dear.

77
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:56,193
Even my shadow is small.

78
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:01,466
Oh, it'd sure be nice
if my friends needed me.

79
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:06,763
Piglet, could you help me
lullaby the bees?

80
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:11,393
Piglet, could you help me
call them to the hive?

81
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:14,896
Yeah, Piglet,
could you help me reach higher?

82
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:18,900
Piglet, we need your help.

83
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,097
Ahh.

84
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:51,099
Wonderfullest honey.

85
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,101
Oh, I thought Tiggers
hated honey.

86
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:56,396
Well, they do to eat,
but to stop the itching...

87
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:58,481
oh, there is
nothing betterer.

88
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,691
- Whoo hoo hoo hoo!
- Oh.

89
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,694
Did you hear something?

90
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,696
I'm afraid I've got
some honey in my ears.

91
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,364
What's that, Pooh?

92
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:08,700
I can't hear you
over all that buzzing.

93
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,577
Who's buzzing?

94
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:15,165
Bees!

95
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,875
What say we break for lunch?

96
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,169
But what about our honey?

97
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:21,379
It's your honey or your life.

98
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:22,797
Hmm.

99
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,883
- Come on!
- Oh, boy.

100
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:28,595
- Whoo hoo hoo!
- Oh, bother!

101
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,388
Here they come! Aah!

102
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:31,890
<i>Aah! Ooh! Ooh! Run!</i>

103
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:33,600
Oh, joy.

104
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,685
- Thanks, donkey boy.
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:37,687
- Thanks, Eeyore.
- Anytime.

106
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:39,898
- Thank you, Eeyore.
- You're welcome.

107
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,776
<i>Aah!</i>

108
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:45,779
<i>Quick,
make a beeline for Piglet's!</i>

109
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,085
Oh! Oh! Faster!

110
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:07,467
Run faster! Faster!

111
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,679
I can't stand it!

112
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,474
They're going to get us!
Get the door! The door!

113
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,101
Ooh! Hurry!

114
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:20,105
Ohh!

115
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:21,189
<i>Oh, they're gone.</i>

116
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:22,899
Or maybe just pretenderin'.

117
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,068
You know,
bees are sneaky like that.

118
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:30,198
I was right.

119
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:34,995
<i>Eeyore.</i>

120
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,165
You got stung out there?

121
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,501
No. I got stung right here...

122
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,879
where I can keep an eye on it.

123
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:46,089
Is everyone all right?

124
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,675
Uh, Tigger's here.
Eeyore's here.

125
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,177
<i>Pooh is here. I'm here.</i>

126
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:52,804
<i>Hmm. Who am I forgetting?</i>

127
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:56,183
I don't know, Rabbit.
Let's ask... Piglet!

128
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:57,684
Oh, bother.

129
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,186
Are you all right, Pooh?

130
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,564
I just landed on my, um... self.

131
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:06,067
Say, what do we have here?

132
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,999
Oh, please, Tigger. It's just
a drawing in a scrapbook.

133
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,667
<i>But it reminds me...</i>

134
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:27,088
<i>of the bestest family reunion
I ever had.</i>

135
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:35,597
Ahem.

136
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,975
<i>Oh, look. There's
the day little Piglet...</i>

137
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,894
caught his first Heffalump.

138
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:42,604
That was no Heffalump.

139
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:45,065
<i>That was just Pooh
with a jar on his head.</i>

140
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:47,901
I forgot how much
I look like a Heffalump...

141
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:49,569
with a jar on my head.

142
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:50,904
Ohh.

143
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:52,781
He captured Rabbit, all right.

144
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:54,783
Oh, let me see! Heh.

145
00:10:57,577 --> 00:10:59,871
That doesn't look
a thing like me.

146
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,583
<i>Oh... what's next?</i>

147
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:09,881
- What's that tiny pink dot?
-I believe it's Piglet.

148
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:13,301
Piglet? Where is Piglet?

149
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:17,097
We must've lost track of him
after we got chased by the bees.

150
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:19,266
Ohh, but he's so little.

151
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:21,601
He could be in big danger.

152
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:25,272
We have to find him
and make sure he's all right.

153
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:28,692
But how will we find him?
He could be anywhere.

154
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:31,695
Ohh... think, think, think.

155
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:36,867
You know, since this is a book
of Piglet's memories...

156
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,786
maybe it remembers
where Piglet is.

157
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,372
Oh, brilliant deduction there,
Pooh boy.

158
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,666
It's a regular Piglet map.
Hoo hoo!

159
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,085
That's the silliest thing
I've ever heard.

160
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:50,505
Let's start with page one.

161
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:56,178
Well, page one remembers
Owl's house. Heh heh heh.

162
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:57,971
Way to go, Pooh boy!

163
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:00,682
Why, I bet that little fella's
there right now.

164
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:02,100
Let's go find him!

165
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,686
Then off to Owl's house we go.

166
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:06,688
He has an answer
for everything.

167
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:08,190
Not to Owl's.

168
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,276
Oh, no.
We'll be there all day.

169
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,695
You can never
get a word in edgewise.

170
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,197
Good-bye, honey.

171
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,002
I may be small...

172
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:32,881
but in the biggest,
helpfullest way!

173
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:47,687
Eeyore?

174
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:50,398
Where are you? Tigger?

175
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:52,776
Where are you?

176
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:56,905
<i>Oh, no.</i>

177
00:12:56,905 --> 00:12:58,073
The bees!

178
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:00,992
Oh! Ohh!

179
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,377
What can I do?

180
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:19,469
Well, I did help you
get the haycorn...

181
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:22,305
and bring you across the river.

182
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:24,599
Maybe my friends need me.

183
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:32,899
I have to find them.

184
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:37,404
<i>Owl, have you seen Piglet?</i>

185
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:41,199
Piglet? Heh heh.
Of course I've seen Piglet--

186
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,492
many times.

187
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:45,787
He's about so high,
with little pink ears--

188
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:48,290
No, no, no. We mean now!

189
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,292
Have you seen him this morning?

190
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:54,379
Hmm. I can't imagine
that he's changed that much.

191
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:56,381
Ohh.

192
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,300
De do do do do do.

193
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,969
This is the part
where Owl goes on for a while.

194
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:03,471
As a matter of fact,
I just saw him go by.

195
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:08,768
He was just here?
Shh. Come on. Let's go.

196
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:10,270
...before he's missing.

197
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,272
<i>Then you could stop,
of course...</i>

198
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:13,773
<i>in the obvious place,
which is...</i>

199
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:16,276
- Ohh.
- As I was saying...

200
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:18,195
<i>I have some great stories...</i>

201
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:21,990
about my second cousin Rupert,
who stowed away on a...

202
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,993
Eeyore, come on!

203
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:29,498
As I was saying,
the great expedition--

204
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:31,875
what an expedition it was.

205
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:35,795
I told you
this was a silly idea.

206
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,006
But he was just at Owl's.

207
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:41,092
The scrappity book
does know where he's going!

208
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:44,095
Well, Owl's house
was on page one.

209
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,181
How about page two?

210
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:48,391
Which is a picture of...

211
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,976
Kanga's house.

212
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:53,271
Well, then, Kanga's house
is where we'll look for Piglet.

213
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:55,774
I think you must be right,
Rabbit.

214
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:58,485
Piglet has always liked
visiting Kanga's.

215
00:14:58,485 --> 00:14:59,986
Not always.

216
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,572
There was one time I remember.

217
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:04,908
Oh, yes. When Kanga and Roo...

218
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:08,078
first moved
to the Hundred Acre Wood.

219
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:09,287
<i>Remember, Rabbit?</i>

220
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:12,582
Uh, n-no.
I, uh, I don't seem to recall.

221
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:14,793
Here,
this'll remind your rememberer.

222
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:16,503
- Hoo hoo!
- Ohh.

223
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:19,506
And you came up
with a big plan, Rabbit.

224
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,967
I told you-- I don't remember.

225
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,385
There it is.

226
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,890
<i>You know,
if I remember correctly...</i>

227
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,893
<i>this story
is really about Piglet.</i>

228
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,774
<i>Well, I just don't like it.</i>

229
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:39,484
<i>I don't like it at all.</i>

230
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:43,697
<i>I tell you, we won't be safe
until they're out.</i>

231
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,907
<i>Out of the Hundred Acre Wood.</i>

232
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:49,369
- Rabbit...
- Shh!

233
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:51,997
Isn't it a bit early
to be spying?

234
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:54,583
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

235
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,585
Oh, it's actually moving in!

236
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,879
Ohh! Ohh!

237
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:05,468
Roo. Roo, dear?

238
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:07,888
Here I am, mama! Ha ha ha.

239
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:09,806
It's an invasion!

240
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:12,767
<i>Do you think
they're f-f-fierce?</i>

241
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:14,978
Ha ha!

242
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,398
<i>What does fierce look like?</i>

243
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:24,988
That's what fierce looks like!

244
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,489
She swallowed him whole!

245
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,783
Ohh! Uhh!

246
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:32,370
Ohh, d-d-dear.

247
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,375
He'll be eaten for sure.

248
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,588
Ohh, are you all right?

249
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:44,799
Blaaah! Don't eat me!

250
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:47,302
Why, you must be Piglet.

251
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:50,597
My, when Christopher Robin
said you'd be dropping by...

252
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,098
I had no idea.

253
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:53,975
You know Christopher Robin?

254
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,270
Oh, yes.
He told us all about you...

255
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:58,980
and Pooh and Rabbit and Tigger.

256
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:01,483
The ones hiding
in that tree over there.

257
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:02,984
Hello, dears.

258
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:05,904
Did you hear that?
She called us dears.

259
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:11,701
I'm Kanga, and somewhere
around here is baby Roo.

260
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:13,787
I'm not a baby!

261
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,582
- See? I can do this!
- Ohh!

262
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,379
Well, it's very nice of you...

263
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,673
<i>to go out of your way
to welcome us.</i>

264
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:28,176
- Ha ha ha!
- Aah!

265
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,387
Oops. Sorry.

266
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,972
<i>Oh, Roo.</i>

267
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:35,183
Piglet,
it's almost breakfast time.

268
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:38,895
Would you like to come in
for a little bite, perhaps?

269
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:40,689
Aaah!

270
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:45,902
l do like the sound
of the taste of that.

271
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:48,071
Uh, no, no, no.

272
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:51,199
We're all due
on the other side of the wood...

273
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,576
and we can't be late.

274
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:55,078
Good-bye.

275
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:56,788
Good-bye!

276
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:59,875
Might I, uh, get
that little something to go?

277
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,376
Come on!

278
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:04,171
Aren't they dears?

279
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,507
One--Pooh will distract Kanga...

280
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:09,509
long enough for two--

281
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:12,095
Tigger and I
to take Roo from her pouch...

282
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,599
and three--
replace him with Piglet.

283
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,186
That is very simple.
Just three little steps and--

284
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:23,690
What?!
Replace Roo w-w-with m-m-me?

285
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:26,401
You and Roo are the same size,
give or take here or there.

286
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:29,070
Kanga won't know
the difference. Ha ha.

287
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,907
Not until it's too late. Ha ha.

288
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:34,576
How much too late?

289
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:38,497
Until after we say, ''Aha!''

290
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,588
What do you think? Huh? Hmm?

291
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,798
<i>Ahh? Hmm?</i>

292
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,969
''Ha ha''?
Why would we say, ''Ha ha''?

293
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:56,389
Not ''Ha ha,'' Piglet. ''Aha.''

294
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:58,391
It's a word to say...

295
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:02,270
''This is how things are
and were meant to be.''

296
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,482
Then Kanga will know
that we know where Roo is...

297
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,275
and we'll only give him back...

298
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,903
if she promises to leave
the Hundred Acre Wood...

299
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:11,905
and never return. Ha ha.

300
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:15,992
How is she gonna know that
that is what our aha-ing means?

301
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:20,288
Because we'll practice
saying it in just the right way.

302
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:22,582
We're counting on you, Piglet.

303
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,671
Now everyone pretend
that their flower is Kanga.

304
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:29,798
Ha ha. Ready? Set.

305
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:44,980
There you all are.

306
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:48,900
<i>Oh, you brought flowers!</i>

307
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,571
What nice new neighbors.

308
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:02,289
Heh. Uhh!

309
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:05,584
- Ahem.
- All right, I'm goin'!

310
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:07,878
Roo, dear! Time to come inside!

311
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:09,504
In a minute, mama!

312
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,508
Ready, Pooh?

313
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:16,803
Yes.
Except for one small thing.

314
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:20,473
- What's that?
- What is it I'm supposed to do?

315
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:23,685
Oh! Talk to her very hard...

316
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:25,770
so that she doesn't
notice anything.

317
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:29,399
Oh, of course. Heh heh.

318
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:32,694
Come on, Roo.
Hop in. Let's go inside.

319
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:33,778
Oh, Kanga!

320
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:37,908
Um, talk to her
very hard about what?

321
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:40,994
Anything!

322
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:43,205
I was just wondering...

323
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:45,999
uh, that is...
do you think that...

324
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:47,584
is that a fish in that tree?

325
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:49,711
- Oh!
- Which tree, dear?

326
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:51,004
<i>Up there.</i>

327
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,677
Snug as a piggy in a blanket.

328
00:20:57,677 --> 00:20:59,888
What are you playing,
Mr. Rabbit?

329
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:03,183
That's not a fish, Pooh bear.
It's a bird.

330
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:07,187
Oh, yes, but is it
a starling or a mackerel?

331
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,898
Ohh, it looks kinda wiggly.

332
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:14,486
<i>It could be a jellyfish.
Hmm. It's tough to say.</i>

333
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:17,405
If you'll forgive me, dear,
we really must be going.

334
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:19,908
Kind of a peanut butter
and jellyfish, isn't it?

335
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:21,785
Whoa, whoa! Wait, frog!

336
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:23,203
- Aah! Oh, no!
- Yippee!

337
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:26,790
Whoo!

338
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,793
- Yecch! Ptoo!
- Let's do it again!

339
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:31,878
This is a fun game!

340
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:33,505
Ohh.

341
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:37,008
Are you all right
in there, Roo?

342
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,803
<i>I'm OK. I'm OK!</i>

343
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,304
All right, Roo, dear.

344
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,475
Yahoo!

345
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:48,478
- Ha ha! This is fun!
- Slow down!

346
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:50,897
<i>Rabbit?</i>

347
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:52,983
Oh, Roo.

348
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:54,901
Wooh-ha...booh-ha?

349
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:56,903
Uh...uh...ha ha.

350
00:21:56,903 --> 00:21:58,780
<i>Um...</i>

351
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,782
what was that word?

352
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:05,579
- Aha?
- That's the word.

353
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:07,080
Ah-haah!

354
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,292
Aaah!

355
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,711
Help!

356
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,671
Tigger, Tigger! Pooh bear!

357
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:18,175
<i>Oh, my, Roo, dear.
You've lost your bounce.</i>

358
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:19,676
Tigger! Pooh bear!

359
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:22,679
I think it's time
for your fishy oil.

360
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,307
Fishy oil? What fishy oil?

361
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:27,475
It'll help you bounce
nice and high.

362
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:32,272
You don't want to grow up
small and weak, like Piglet.

363
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:36,276
Now, did you have something
you wanted to tell me... Roo?

364
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:39,905
-Uh, no--
- Down the hatch!

365
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:42,782
Ptoo! Blecch!

366
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:54,878
See that?
You got your bounce back.

367
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:57,088
<i>And if you're
a good little Roo...</i>

368
00:22:57,088 --> 00:22:59,591
<i>I'll let you have
another spoonful.</i>

369
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:02,385
<i>No-o-o!</i>

370
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:08,099
Oh, dear. I'm a goner!

371
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,809
Aaah!

372
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:12,187
You act like I'm going
to cook you for dinner.

373
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:14,481
A-a-aren't you?

374
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:16,691
Why, of course not.

375
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:19,694
Ohh!

376
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:22,489
l'm going to give you a bath.

377
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,409
Aah! Cook me instead!

378
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:28,578
<i>But, Roo, dear.
Don't you know by now...</i>

379
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:31,998
<i>a mother
always knows what's best?</i>

380
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:37,772
Whew !

381
00:24:37,772 --> 00:24:40,275
Aah!

382
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:52,913
Aah!

383
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:56,374
Ah-choo!

384
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:11,806
Oh, my goodness!

385
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:14,309
Aah!

386
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,913
Whee! Ha ha ha!

387
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:38,291
Whee! Ha ha ha!

388
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:43,588
Now, you know what's next.

389
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:45,799
I'm afraid to find out.

390
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,512
There's always two things
you get after your bath.

391
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,013
A cookie.

392
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:56,476
Mwah. And a kiss... Piglet.

393
00:25:57,894 --> 00:25:59,104
Oh.

394
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:04,276
Well,
it's a very subtle distinction.

395
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:07,112
But you see, a jellyfish
sounds more like a--

396
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:08,405
''Blblblblbl!

397
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:10,407
''Hi, I'm a jellyfish!''
Kinda like that.

398
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,908
<i>Tigger, Tigger! Pooh bear!</i>

399
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:15,579
Another creature
of the fiercerest kind!

400
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,789
Rabbit was right.

401
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:22,294
But it's me--Piglet!

402
00:26:22,377 --> 00:26:26,798
Nah, the Piglet we know
isn't half as fuzzy as you.

403
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:30,093
Why, you can't pull the fluff
over our eyes!

404
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:32,804
Pooh, t-tell him who I am.

405
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,390
Well, I'd love to...
whoever you are.

406
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,309
Come to think of it,
he might be...

407
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:39,102
a fuzzy-fringed thingamaw hatsis.

408
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:40,395
Ohh.

409
00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:43,690
No, no, no. This is
more of the feather-furred...

410
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,483
frizzamabobble variety.

411
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:48,695
But can we be sure, Tigger?

412
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:52,782
Oh! I'll prove it to you!

413
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:02,292
Piglet,
where did you come from?

414
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:06,213
Lucky thing that fuzzy-fringed
thingamabob didn't get you.

415
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:08,215
What did you find out?

416
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:09,799
Was she awfully fierce
and fiercefully awful?

417
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:14,095
At first, I thought so,
but then I found out...

418
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:16,306
she's very nice.

419
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:24,314
Hello, dears.

420
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:27,400
Oh, she called us dears again.
Ha ha!

421
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:28,902
I could get used to this.

422
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:31,905
Would you like to come in
for that little something now?

423
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:35,492
I'd love to.
I love little somethings.

424
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:38,912
- But what do we tell Rabbit?
- Wheeee!

425
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:41,206
Ha ha! Mama, look at me!

426
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:42,582
Roo!

427
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:46,002
You gotta see
Mr. Rabbit's garden!

428
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:48,797
Oh, you hear that?
Mr. Rabbit. Ha ha.

429
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,799
It's got carrots
and lettuce and beets...

430
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:52,676
and we played leap bunny--

431
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:54,511
All right. Settle down, dear.

432
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,097
Now , what do we say
to Mr. Rabbit?

433
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,392
Thank you, Mr. Rabbit.
I had fun.

434
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:03,979
Well, I, uh, certainly
enjoyed myself, too...

435
00:28:04,104 --> 00:28:07,107
and you can call me Rabbit.

436
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:09,776
I like you, Rabbit.

437
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:12,404
I like you, too, Roo.

438
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,782
Aha!

439
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,286
You're right, Piglet.

440
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:24,207
This is the way things are
and were meant to be.

441
00:28:30,213 --> 00:28:32,299
<i>You know,
if it weren't for Piglet...</i>

442
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:34,176
<i>I wouldn't be friends with Roo.</i>

443
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,096
And we'd never have found out
how nice Kanga was.

444
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,474
We'd never have
any of Kanga's songs.

445
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:43,101
Or her hugs.

446
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:46,396
Or her cookies, which my nose
is telling my tummy--

447
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:49,900
are right nearby. Heh heh.

448
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:59,201
Kanga!
We're so glad you didn't leave!

449
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:02,204
What are you talking about,
Tigger?

450
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:04,414
How Piglet took a bath for us.

451
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:05,999
<i>Not just any old buddy...</i>

452
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:08,710
<i>would do some thing that brave
for his friends.</i>

453
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:12,797
Don't know if I would.

454
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,176
<i>It was a very biggish thing...</i>

455
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:18,595
<i>for a littleish guy to do.</i>

456
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:20,680
And we're ever so worried
about him, you see...

457
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,892
because we lost him
at the honey harvest...

458
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:27,896
<i>so we're using his book
of memories to find him...</i>

459
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:31,399
we hope.

460
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:33,777
Ohh, dear, Piglet.

461
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:37,614
But he's so small.
He could be in big danger.

462
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:40,575
Mama, may I help them
look for Piglet?

463
00:29:43,078 --> 00:29:45,789
Oops. Sorry, Eeyore.

464
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,582
<i>Can I, mama? Can I?</i>

465
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:51,378
<i>Of course, dear.
Piglet needs your help.</i>

466
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:54,297
Pooh, would you like
a cookie before you go?

467
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:58,176
Oh, my heart tells me I should
keep looking for Piglet.

468
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,886
Oh, but you dears
will need something...

469
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:02,097
to keep your strength up.

470
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,308
My tummy says yes.

471
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:09,396
Oh, I just thought
Piglet would need...

472
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,398
to keep his strength up, too.

473
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,989
- Bye, mama.
- Bye-bye, dear.

474
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:20,615
So, where do we look first?

475
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:23,201
The scrapbook
will give us an idea.

476
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:28,290
It's a book of memories.
It remembers where Piglet is.

477
00:30:28,415 --> 00:30:30,500
Try page three.

478
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,795
Page three shows all of us
at the North Pole.

479
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:36,381
<i>Hey, that was
the day we made...</i>

480
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:38,884
<i>our most spien deriferous
discovery of all.</i>

481
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:41,303
Then that's where we shall look.

482
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,388
But this is not the way
to the North Pole.

483
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:46,600
Well, last time, if
I reconnoiter correctically...

484
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,686
the north pole was sort of
in a south-down-easterly...

485
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,189
kind of over and down
direction this way...

486
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:53,315
magnellically speaking.

487
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,776
No. Last time we went this way.

488
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:59,279
No. That would be
the Northeast Pole.

489
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,907
- No, no, no, and no.
- Don't be ridiculous.

490
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:03,617
I know what I'm talking about .
It's this way.

491
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:04,993
<i>I--don't interrupt.</i>

492
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:07,078
Perhaps if we told the story...

493
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:11,082
the story will tell us
how to get there.

494
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,584
<i>Don't forget
the part about Piglet.</i>

495
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:15,504
<i>Piglet?
How does Piglet fit in?</i>

496
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:17,088
<i>Oh, Roo's right.</i>

497
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:20,217
<i>It really is a story
about Piglet, isn't it?</i>

498
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,594
Nine-itty-eight,
nine-itty-nine...

499
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:25,180
seventy-two-itty
and thirteen-itty...

500
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:27,015
and forty-six-itty...

501
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,683
and one whole hundred...

502
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:31,394
gravity-defiant,
Tiggerific bounces.

503
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:32,812
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

504
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:34,981
<i>Look out below!</i>

505
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:39,986
Hmm.

506
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:41,196
<i>Aah!</i>

507
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,781
Heh heh heh heh.

508
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,289
Hello, Tigger. Hello, Piglet.

509
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:53,500
Oh.

510
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,876
What are you doing?

511
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:57,879
<i>Aw, just waiting
for the other shoe to plop.</i>

512
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,594
I knew it. Hoo hoo! These
things always travel in pairs.

513
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:08,181
These are Christopher Robin's
big boots.

514
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:10,600
They can mean only one thing.

515
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:13,895
An expedition.

516
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:15,397
Yahoo hoo hoo hoo!

517
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:19,317
Um, which petition?

518
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:21,611
Yes. An expedition.

519
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:23,697
It's when you go off
to find a thing.

520
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:25,991
What are w  going to find,
Christopher Robin?

521
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,410
The North Pole.

522
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,203
Is it scary?

523
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:31,913
What is the North Pole?

524
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:34,791
Yeah. Come to think of it, we
never found one of them before.

525
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,878
Well, it's a thing you discover.

526
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:40,088
Are bears good
at discovering it?

527
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,799
- And Tiggers?
- Everyone will come along.

528
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,887
And if you see the North Pole,
shout, ''Eureka!''

529
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:48,597
- Oof!
- Why would we do that?

530
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,018
<i>Because it means,
''There's the North Pole.''</i>

531
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:54,477
Eureka!

532
00:32:54,603 --> 00:32:55,687
<i>Where?</i>

533
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:57,105
- Where?
- Gesundheit.

534
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:59,191
Sorry.

535
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:00,817
I--I was just practicing.

536
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:02,986
We need a marching song.

537
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:09,409
A marching song
to help us along.

538
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:18,895
This is fun.

539
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:27,487
One more time!

540
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:39,207
I like that song.

541
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:41,585
Ha ha ha ha ha.

542
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:43,587
Silly old bear.

543
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,090
Would you like a haycorn, Pooh?

544
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:52,095
No, thank you, but a cookie
would be nice. Ha.

545
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:54,097
Or a banana.

546
00:34:58,101 --> 00:34:59,477
Ow!

547
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,397
Christopher Robin...

548
00:35:02,397 --> 00:35:07,903
perhaps I could find it easier
if only I was sure.

549
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:12,407
That is, if I knew
what the North Pole looked like.

550
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:13,700
Mmm.

551
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,203
<i>Well, it's kind of...</i>

552
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:19,206
<i>It's sort of, well...</i>

553
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:22,709
I suppose we'll know exactly
what it is when we see it.

554
00:35:27,797 --> 00:35:30,800
Are we there yet? Whoa!

555
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,387
<i>Pooh!</i>

556
00:35:34,513 --> 00:35:35,597
Ho ho...

557
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:39,684
I just fed my tummy,
and it's still calling me.

558
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:43,188
Ha ha ha! Hey, look at me, Pooh!

559
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:44,898
Oh, I am.

560
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:46,608
Pooh, I'm swimming!

561
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:49,486
Just a moment, Roo.
I'm talking to my tummy.

562
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:51,404
Well, of course you're swimming.

563
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:54,407
You shouldn't have had
that second cookie.

564
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:56,618
That's not your stomach, Pooh.
It's Roo!

565
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:59,913
Oh, my!
Roo, I don't believe...

566
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:02,791
expeditions
usually go into the water.

567
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:06,878
Quick!

568
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:10,090
Don't panic, Kanga.
Everything's fine here!

569
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:14,010
Nobody's in any kind of a--
especially not Roo! Ha ha!

570
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,012
Do something!

571
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:18,306
Everyone--do anything!

572
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:22,310
Don't worry, Roo, boy!
I'll save ya!

573
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:28,900
Thanks, Tigger,
but I don't think I need saving.

574
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:33,405
I can help!

575
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:35,991
Piglet, stay here out of the way
while we save Roo!

576
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:38,410
We don't want to have
to rescue two little guys!

577
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:41,204
Catch onto my tail, Roo.

578
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:43,290
I'll pull ya out.

579
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:45,500
Just tell me when you're on.

580
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:46,918
Oops!

581
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:50,005
Oh!

582
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:56,011
Rabbit, Roo?
Are we going swimming?

583
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:01,808
Hey! Maybe we can use this
to save Roo!

584
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:04,394
Give me a push, Pooh!

585
00:37:04,394 --> 00:37:06,104
Thank you, Piglet.

586
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:08,690
Ha ha. Now I've got him!

587
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,818
Faster, Pooh! Faster! Pooh?

588
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:13,320
W ere is he, Rabbit?

589
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,618
Pooh! Look the other way!

590
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:22,579
<i>I can see him perfectly
from here!</i>

591
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:23,997
Are you sure, Rabbit?

592
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,416
You're right.

593
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:30,795
You can see better from up here.
There he is!

594
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:32,088
- Aah!
- Oh!

595
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:39,304
Ha ha ha! Whoa!

596
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:41,515
Roo, are you OK?

597
00:37:42,516 --> 00:37:45,101
I gotcha, Roo! I gotcha!

598
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:46,603
Here he is, Kanga!

599
00:37:46,686 --> 00:37:48,396
Ta-da!

600
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:50,315
Oh... where'd he go?

601
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:55,904
- My Great Uncle Rupert...
- Pooh bear? Pooh bear!

602
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:57,906
Pooh bear!

603
00:37:57,906 --> 00:38:02,202
<i>You can rescue me now.
I'm gettin' kinda tired.</i>

604
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:07,999
Use the pole! Use the pole!

605
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:11,419
No time for fishing, Piglet!
We gotta save Roo!

606
00:38:16,716 --> 00:38:18,218
Grab on, Roo!

607
00:38:23,515 --> 00:38:26,184
- Hee hee hee!
- Pooh, could you hold this?

608
00:38:26,184 --> 00:38:28,520
<i>Hee hee hee...</i>

609
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:31,690
Did you see me swimmin'?

610
00:38:31,815 --> 00:38:33,900
That's called swimmin',
what I was doing.

611
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,902
<i>Pooh bear!</i>

612
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:40,699
Pooh bear!
Where did you find that stick?

613
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,409
What , uh, stick?

614
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:43,702
That stick!

615
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:47,414
Well, I was standing here
without a stick...

616
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:49,708
and then I had a stick, so...

617
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:52,419
maybe the stick found me.

618
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:56,089
Assembled adventurers,
the expedition is over...

619
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:59,301
for Pooh has discovered
the North Pole!

620
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:01,386
- This?
- That.

621
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:05,182
Eureka!

622
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:06,808
Hoo hoo! Well, I'll be.

623
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:09,519
That's the North Pole,
all right, all righty!

624
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:12,314
I should have seen it myself!

625
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:14,316
But--but--oh...

626
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,985
well... eureka!

627
00:39:16,985 --> 00:39:18,987
- Eureka!
- Yay!

628
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:20,989
Hooray for Pooh!

629
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:22,407
- Polerific!
- Hooray!

630
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:23,700
Positively magnetic!

631
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,912
Goodness! Where's Eeyore?

632
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:29,414
Did ya grab on yet, Roo?

633
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:32,417
Roo?

634
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:34,503
Somebody.

635
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:39,007
Anybody?

636
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:46,181
<i>Hooray for Pooh.</i>

637
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:47,599
<i>I always liked that story.</i>

638
00:39:47,682 --> 00:39:50,810
It has such a lovely end.

639
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,522
But nobody said
hooray for Piglet.

640
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:55,190
He was so brave...

641
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,692
for someone so small.

642
00:39:58,902 --> 00:40:01,321
<i>And Piglets
hate water. Hoo hoo.</i>

643
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:03,782
Come to think of it,
so do Tiggers.

644
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:05,700
W-y-yooouh!

645
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,285
Wha-ha!

646
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:11,206
Thank you, tail!

647
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:15,585
Thank you, Piglet,
wherever you are.

648
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:17,504
Look!

649
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:18,797
<i>Piglet's scarf!</i>

650
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:20,715
<i>That's it! Come on, let's go!</i>

651
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:22,884
Missed him again.

652
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:29,391
Oh, my.

653
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:32,519
You know Piglet's scarf never
goes anywhere without Piglet.

654
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,105
Oh! This is
more serious than I thought!

655
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:37,899
Maybe he's in grave danger.

656
00:40:37,983 --> 00:40:40,485
Maybe Heffalumps got him!

657
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,196
- Heffalumps?
- Or--or Woozles!

658
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:44,614
W-Woozles?

659
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:45,699
And now
he's out there somewhere...

660
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:47,200
And now
he's out there somewhere...

661
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,119
with a storm brewing in.

662
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:51,288
Oh, goodness!

663
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:53,206
Goodness!

664
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:55,917
Do you think
he's gonna be all right?

665
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:59,921
Piglet shall be
very all right, indeed.

666
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:03,300
Don't let his small size
worry you.

667
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,095
Yep. Once he even made
a whole house.

668
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,014
He did?

669
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:12,601
Do you know the story
of The House at Pooh Corner?

670
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:14,603
Mmm... no.

671
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:17,397
- Oh, yes. It's right here.
- Page three.

672
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,608
On page four.

673
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:22,110
That's after three.

674
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:26,281
Oh, It's a lovely tale.
Don't you think so, Tigger?

675
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:28,700
- Tigger?
- Huh?

676
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,203
- Pooh Corner. Remember?
- Oh, yeah!

677
00:41:31,286 --> 00:41:33,622
Is this story
about Piglet, too?

678
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:36,708
Why, yes, Roo, it is.

679
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:40,212
He seems to be the hero
of every story.

680
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:09,616
Goodness!

681
00:42:10,784 --> 00:42:12,702
I was just thinking, Pooh...

682
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:17,207
Oh! Were you thinking of a way
to keep warm?

683
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,001
Actually, I was thinking...

684
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:23,213
about how you have a house
and I have a house...

685
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:24,589
and Rabbit and Owl...

686
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:27,801
and Christopher Robin
all have houses...

687
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:30,512
but poor Eeyore has nothing.

688
00:42:30,512 --> 00:42:34,683
Well, that's certainly
something we could think about.

689
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:35,892
Hmm...

690
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:38,812
- Think, think, think. Hmm...
- Think, think, think.

691
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:41,606
l'v e got it! Whoa--oh!

692
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,899
Got what?

693
00:42:47,112 --> 00:42:50,490
we'll build Eeyore
a house of his own!

694
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,618
Oh, that's a wonderful idea,
Pooh!

695
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:58,498
But where shall we build it?

696
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:04,212
Well...

697
00:43:06,214 --> 00:43:07,591
right here.

698
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:10,218
Because this is where
I thought of it.

699
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:12,721
And since this is where
I thought of it...

700
00:43:12,804 --> 00:43:15,599
we shall call this place
Pooh Corner.

701
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,393
Pooh Corner?

702
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:23,190
Uh, Pooh, I was thinking
along with you.

703
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,609
Yes, that's true, Piglet.

704
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:29,988
So we could call this place
Pooh and Piglet Corner...

705
00:43:30,113 --> 00:43:31,990
if Pooh Corner
didn't sound better...

706
00:43:32,115 --> 00:43:36,620
which it does, being smaller
and more like a corner.

707
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,414
So, Pooh Corner it is.

708
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:43,585
Look! Snow somersaults!
Hoo hoo hoo!

709
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:45,003
Whoa! Whoa-oa-oa!

710
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:48,423
<i>Bother.</i>

711
00:43:48,423 --> 00:43:52,010
You know, I tried to stop,
but it's snow use.

712
00:43:52,093 --> 00:43:55,388
Get it? Snow use! Hoo hoo hoo!

713
00:43:55,514 --> 00:43:56,890
So, whatcha doin'?

714
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,393
We're going to build Eeyore
a house at Pooh Corner.

715
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:03,396
What a tickerific idea! Hoo hoo!

716
00:44:03,396 --> 00:44:04,606
Whatcha going to build it with?

717
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,484
Uh, we haven't decided.

718
00:44:07,484 --> 00:44:11,696
Say! I just bounced by
a humongerous pile of sticks!

719
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:14,282
They'd be positively perfect
for a donkey house!

720
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:19,496
Come on! Bounce this way!
Hoo hoo hoo!

721
00:44:19,496 --> 00:44:20,997
Follow the bouncing Tigger!

722
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:36,221
What did I tell ya?

723
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:40,016
More sticks
than you can stick a shake at.

724
00:44:42,102 --> 00:44:45,897
Gee, it's almost as if
someone left them here for us.

725
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:47,816
Whoo--ooh--whoo!

726
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:49,818
I wonder...

727
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:50,902
Naw!

728
00:44:50,986 --> 00:44:53,989
Now let's get started,
so we can finish in time.

729
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:57,284
Uhh!
In time for what? Ah!

730
00:44:57,284 --> 00:44:58,702
Lunch.

731
00:46:01,723 --> 00:46:02,891
Hello!

732
00:46:34,714 --> 00:46:38,009
There. It's all entirely done.

733
00:46:38,093 --> 00:46:41,805
Let's show old donkey boy
the fruits of our elbow grease.

734
00:46:53,984 --> 00:46:56,486
Oh, bother.

735
00:46:56,486 --> 00:46:58,196
I suspect-erate
there's something...

736
00:46:58,196 --> 00:47:00,198
definitely wrong
with these sticks.

737
00:47:00,198 --> 00:47:05,287
All we wanted was for Eeyore
to have his own house.

738
00:47:05,287 --> 00:47:08,498
You know,
Eeyore could come live with me.

739
00:47:09,624 --> 00:47:12,210
That is very hospiticious
of you, Pooh.

740
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:16,089
Let's go give
old donkey boy the good news!

741
00:47:16,214 --> 00:47:18,592
Hoo hoo hoo hoo-hoo!

742
00:47:22,387 --> 00:47:24,014
Oh, dear.

743
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:35,984
Hello!

744
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:38,904
Pooh bear!
Oh, you're just in time!

745
00:47:38,904 --> 00:47:40,197
Look what O made.

746
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:42,115
<i>Why, Christopher Robin.</i>

747
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:44,493
It's wonderful!

748
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:46,912
<i>What is it?</i>

749
00:47:46,995 --> 00:47:49,623
<i>Why, it's you, Pooh bear.</i>

750
00:47:49,623 --> 00:47:52,918
<i>Ha ha. No wonder
he looks so familiar.</i>

751
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:56,087
<i>He looks just like you!</i>

752
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:58,089
Except, of course,
for the donkey head.

753
00:47:58,089 --> 00:48:01,718
Eeyore, were you under there
the whole time?

754
00:48:01,718 --> 00:48:03,803
I suppose I was.

755
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:06,014
Weren't you awfully cold
under there?

756
00:48:06,014 --> 00:48:07,599
I've been colder.

757
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,019
Last night, for instance,
it got downright--

758
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:12,521
Freezing.

759
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:16,525
So I did it.
I built myself a house.

760
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:18,902
Did ya hear that?
Eeyore built himself a house!

761
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:22,197
Just a leaky pile of sticks.

762
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:25,492
Did you say... sticks?

763
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:26,993
So you have seen it.

764
00:48:27,118 --> 00:48:28,995
l have? Seen what?

765
00:48:28,995 --> 00:48:30,997
You know, the funny thing
about houses...

766
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:33,124
is, uh, well,
they never know...

767
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:36,086
if they're comin' or goin',
and so they do.

768
00:48:36,086 --> 00:48:40,090
Well, someone somewhere
must know something.

769
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,716
<i>I do !</i>

770
00:48:43,802 --> 00:48:45,095
<i>What's that?</i>

771
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,390
<i>It's a high-steppin'
pig highfaluter!</i>

772
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:52,018
<i>I believe
it's Piglet on stilts.</i>

773
00:48:52,018 --> 00:48:54,187
Eeyore's house is over there.

774
00:48:58,024 --> 00:48:59,818
Come on. I-I'll show you.

775
00:49:01,987 --> 00:49:03,905
<i>Toodle-oo.</i>

776
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:23,925
Look at that!

777
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:25,886
Well, I'll be...

778
00:49:26,011 --> 00:49:27,387
Oh, my goodness!

779
00:49:29,306 --> 00:49:32,392
Welcome home, Eeyore.
Hee hee hee.

780
00:49:32,392 --> 00:49:34,603
Whoa-oh...

781
00:49:34,686 --> 00:49:36,688
Whoa!

782
00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:37,898
Whaa--

783
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:40,108
Whoaaa!

784
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:44,112
Hmm...

785
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:46,823
it's my house, all right.

786
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:51,703
But I'm sure
this isn't where I built it.

787
00:49:51,786 --> 00:49:54,498
Where you built it?
But--but--I--

788
00:49:54,498 --> 00:49:59,085
Hmm. I suppose the wind
must have blown it over here.

789
00:49:59,085 --> 00:50:01,087
The wind?

790
00:50:02,214 --> 00:50:03,798
Oh, yeah, the wind.

791
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:08,303
Oh, well, it's been known to do
strange and windy-like things.

792
00:50:08,303 --> 00:50:11,306
I think the wind
had a little help.

793
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:13,099
<i>Right, Piglet?</i>

794
00:50:14,226 --> 00:50:17,896
The important thing is,
Eeyore has a house...

795
00:50:17,896 --> 00:50:21,316
and here it is,
and it's as good as ever.

796
00:50:21,316 --> 00:50:22,692
And even never betterer.

797
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:24,986
You really think so?

798
00:50:24,986 --> 00:50:28,406
Oh, yes. Much more better
than ever, even, Piglet.

799
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,326
Just one thing bothers me.

800
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:34,621
Oh, dear. What might that be?

801
00:50:34,704 --> 00:50:37,290
'Fraid I'll lose it again.

802
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,501
Don't w rry, Eeyore.
I put up a sign...

803
00:50:39,626 --> 00:50:42,796
so you'll always know
where it is. See?

804
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:45,507
<i>''Pooh Corner.''</i>

805
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,092
Nice.

806
00:50:48,301 --> 00:50:50,303
<i>Hooray for Eeyore's house!</i>

807
00:50:50,387 --> 00:50:52,722
Hooray for Eeyore's house!

808
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:08,613
What?

809
00:51:08,697 --> 00:51:11,116
It's a little crowded...

810
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:13,618
but it'll do.

811
00:51:16,705 --> 00:51:20,000
And that is how
Piglet got the idea...

812
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:23,587
that you, Eeyore,
should have your own house.

813
00:51:23,587 --> 00:51:27,507
You mean Piglet built
Eeyore's house all by himself?

814
00:51:27,507 --> 00:51:31,219
Yes, and that's just
how much Piglet cares.

815
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:34,890
Uh-huh. Best house I ever had.

816
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:38,727
And named it after me.
Oh.

817
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:40,312
Piglet!

818
00:51:40,312 --> 00:51:43,190
Piglet!

819
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,025
Piglet!

820
00:51:46,526 --> 00:51:49,196
Piglet, Piglet.

821
00:51:49,321 --> 00:51:50,697
Piglet!

822
00:51:50,697 --> 00:51:52,324
<i>Piglet!</i>

823
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:55,118
Piglet!

824
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:04,127
Piglet!

825
00:52:05,295 --> 00:52:06,296
Piglet!

826
00:52:06,296 --> 00:52:09,299
Piglet! Piglet! Piglet!

827
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:12,511
Ah-choo!

828
00:52:12,594 --> 00:52:13,803
Oh, dear.

829
00:52:13,803 --> 00:52:17,098
We better find him soon.
Roo's getting cold.

830
00:52:27,818 --> 00:52:29,611
Piglet!

831
00:52:32,322 --> 00:52:35,617
<i>Piglet! Piglet!</i>

832
00:52:36,993 --> 00:52:40,121
Well, perhaps we should
look in the book again.

833
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:42,916
Hey, I just got
a Tiggerific idea.

834
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:45,126
Let's see where the book ends
and go there.

835
00:52:45,126 --> 00:52:47,128
- What do you think?
- No, no, no.

836
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:49,005
lf we do this
in an orderly manner...

837
00:52:49,005 --> 00:52:50,799
we'll find him much quicker.

838
00:52:50,924 --> 00:52:54,594
Now, let's see.
We've been there and there...

839
00:52:54,594 --> 00:52:57,597
But orderlier doesn't seem
to be working, does it?

840
00:52:57,597 --> 00:53:01,393
All I'm concerned about
is finding Piglet.

841
00:53:01,393 --> 00:53:03,228
Well, I want to find him, too.

842
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:05,897
We all want to find him!

843
00:53:06,022 --> 00:53:08,316
Rabbit, look!

844
00:53:08,316 --> 00:53:09,609
Oh, bother.

845
00:53:09,609 --> 00:53:11,194
- Rabbit, the book!
- Oh, my.

846
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:16,616
You're ruining it, Rabbit!

847
00:53:16,616 --> 00:53:17,993
I am not.

848
00:53:18,118 --> 00:53:19,327
Hand it over, bunny boy.

849
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:21,997
Finding Piglets
is what Tiggers do best.

850
00:53:22,122 --> 00:53:23,999
lt's what Rabbits do best.

851
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:25,208
- Tiggers!
- No, Rabbits.

852
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:26,626
- Tiggers!
- Rabbits!

853
00:53:26,626 --> 00:53:28,211
- No, Tiggers!
- Rabbits!

854
00:53:28,211 --> 00:53:31,006
- Stop it! Stop fighting!
- Oh, be careful.

855
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:32,215
<i>Rabbits!</i>

856
00:53:32,215 --> 00:53:34,718
That's the only way
we have to find Piglet.

857
00:53:34,718 --> 00:53:37,304
Oh, no!

858
00:53:54,112 --> 00:53:56,114
There goes our map.

859
00:53:58,992 --> 00:54:01,620
<i>And Piglet's memories.</i>

860
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:10,212
I only wanted to find Piglet.

861
00:54:10,295 --> 00:54:12,088
We all did.

862
00:54:19,596 --> 00:54:22,098
Oh, dear.
We better go back to Piglet's.

863
00:54:22,098 --> 00:54:25,101
<i>We have to get Roo
warm and dry.</i>

864
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:38,615
Oh, I do wish I had called it
Pooh and Piglet Corn--oh.

865
00:55:37,507 --> 00:55:39,593
That's the Piglet I know --

866
00:55:39,718 --> 00:55:43,513
<i>always glad to see you.</i>

867
00:55:43,597 --> 00:55:47,225
- Always thoughtful.
- Always brave.

868
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:50,520
- Mm-hmm.
- Never thinking of himself.

869
00:55:50,604 --> 00:55:52,606
Draw another one, Pooh.

870
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:19,294
We got to go get Piglet!

871
00:58:19,294 --> 00:58:21,421
Let's go find Piglet, indeed.

872
00:58:21,505 --> 00:58:23,423
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

873
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,928
Uhh!

874
00:58:32,891 --> 00:58:34,309
<i>Oh, poor Piglet.</i>

875
00:58:34,392 --> 00:58:36,019
<i>Oh. Oh, goodness.</i>

876
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:39,606
Piglet!

877
00:58:41,399 --> 00:58:43,026
Piglet!

878
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:45,695
Piglet!

879
00:58:45,695 --> 00:58:47,697
Piglet!

880
00:58:47,823 --> 00:58:49,825
Piglet!

881
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:51,117
Piglet!

882
00:58:51,201 --> 00:58:54,120
Piglet!

883
00:58:54,204 --> 00:58:55,705
Piglet?

884
00:58:59,626 --> 00:59:00,919
Look.

885
00:59:02,295 --> 00:59:03,505
Oh, look what I found.

886
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:08,510
<i>It's one of Piglet's
scrapbook pages.</i>

887
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,011
Look, another one.

888
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:12,514
Maybe we could put Piglet's
scrappity book back together.

889
00:59:12,514 --> 00:59:14,224
Then we can find him
in no time.

890
00:59:15,392 --> 00:59:16,726
Well, let's keep looking.

891
00:59:16,726 --> 00:59:18,019
I found one!

892
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:20,397
Me, too.

893
00:59:20,397 --> 00:59:22,816
Me, too.

894
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:24,693
Aha!

895
00:59:24,818 --> 00:59:26,903
Eureka!

896
00:59:26,903 --> 00:59:29,197
- I think...
- I found...

897
00:59:29,322 --> 00:59:30,699
Another other!

898
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:32,200
- Here's one.
- Wonderful.

899
00:59:32,325 --> 00:59:33,994
We're getting closer.

900
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:36,997
Here's one.
How many does that make?

901
00:59:37,122 --> 00:59:38,331
Look, here's another one.

902
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:41,001
<i>-Piglet will be so happy.
-What's that over there?</i>

903
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:43,795
Uhh!

904
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,091
Come back, memory!

905
00:59:48,091 --> 00:59:49,301
Hoo hoo hoo!

906
00:59:49,301 --> 00:59:50,927
Ohh!

907
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:52,721
<i>Guhh!</i>

908
00:59:53,722 --> 00:59:55,307
Ooh!

909
00:59:55,307 --> 00:59:59,394
One more scrappy page
for Piglet's scrappity book.

910
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:02,814
Hey, look, there it is.

911
01:00:02,814 --> 01:00:04,816
<i>But how will we get it?</i>

912
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,693
Oh, we need help.

913
01:00:09,821 --> 01:00:12,991
That's got to be dangerous.
What could he be thinking?

914
01:00:13,116 --> 01:00:15,118
- Who?
- Pooh.

915
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:19,331
No. Now, now, no one panic.

916
01:00:19,414 --> 01:00:21,791
The first thing we do
is not to panic because--

917
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:24,419
Somebody do something!
Do anything!

918
01:00:24,419 --> 01:00:26,421
<i>Uhh! Oh, my goodness!</i>

919
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:27,506
Stay calm.

920
01:00:27,631 --> 01:00:29,132
<i>Everybody calm. Don't panic.</i>

921
01:00:29,216 --> 01:00:30,717
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

922
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,011
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

923
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:34,513
What are you doing?

924
01:00:34,513 --> 01:00:37,599
I'm just getting
Piglet's memories.

925
01:00:37,724 --> 01:00:39,017
Oh, bother.

926
01:00:39,017 --> 01:00:40,101
<i>Pooh needs our help!</i>

927
01:00:40,227 --> 01:00:42,229
Oh!

928
01:00:42,312 --> 01:00:45,232
Oh, bother, bother.

929
01:00:47,192 --> 01:00:51,196
Rabbit was right.
We could use a little help.

930
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:52,823
<i>Here you go, buddy boy.</i>

931
01:00:52,906 --> 01:00:56,326
We made you a rescue rope!
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

932
01:00:56,326 --> 01:00:59,204
- Out of us!
- Me, too.

933
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:01,122
It's our plan.

934
01:01:05,794 --> 01:01:07,712
Ohh. Ohh.

935
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:09,130
Oh, my.

936
01:01:09,214 --> 01:01:11,299
Pooh, what are you waiting for?

937
01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:13,301
The rescue rope isn't rescuing.

938
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:17,514
- We need a little bit more.
- We just need a little help.

939
01:01:17,597 --> 01:01:22,894
- Who's small enough?
- Oh, dear. Who can help?

940
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:25,730
- Piglet! Oh!
- Piglet.

941
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:28,108
- Piglet!
- Piglet!

942
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:34,197
You can do it, Piglet.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

943
01:01:34,197 --> 01:01:35,907
My friends need me.

944
01:01:35,907 --> 01:01:39,911
Hang on, Pooh! Uhh!

945
01:01:39,911 --> 01:01:42,706
Oh, I'm hanging. Piglet.

946
01:01:59,222 --> 01:02:00,932
<i>Ohh.</i>

947
01:02:00,932 --> 01:02:04,603
<i>Oh, Piglet! Your memories!</i>

948
01:02:08,398 --> 01:02:09,900
Whoa!

949
01:02:12,402 --> 01:02:13,695
Oh, no!

950
01:02:17,824 --> 01:02:21,203
Ohh.

951
01:02:21,203 --> 01:02:23,497
Ohh...

952
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:27,918
Oh, no.

953
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:43,809
We--we never got
to tell Piglet...

954
01:02:43,809 --> 01:02:46,019
how we feel about him.

955
01:02:46,102 --> 01:02:47,312
Poor Pooh.

956
01:02:47,312 --> 01:02:50,899
Should've told them
when we had the chance.

957
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:53,693
Ohh. Ohh!

958
01:02:55,612 --> 01:02:57,531
Oh!

959
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,621
Here you go, R-Rabbit.

960
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:06,623
Something must be very sad.

961
01:03:06,623 --> 01:03:09,209
Well, of course it's sad.

962
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:11,920
- Pooh?
- Pooh?

963
01:03:13,421 --> 01:03:14,798
Piglet!

964
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:17,133
Oh, thank goodness you're safe.

965
01:03:17,133 --> 01:03:19,511
We're so glad to see you.

966
01:03:20,595 --> 01:03:22,806
- Glad to see me?
- Oh, yes.

967
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:25,100
It's so good
to have you back again.

968
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,310
Yeah. We've been
following your memories...

969
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:29,020
all over
the Hundred Acre Wood...

970
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,231
and they led us right to you.

971
01:03:31,231 --> 01:03:35,902
Too bad they're all
floating down the river.

972
01:03:36,027 --> 01:03:37,904
Oh, goodness.

973
01:03:37,904 --> 01:03:39,114
- Oh, no.
- Oops.

974
01:03:41,116 --> 01:03:42,826
<i>Oh, bother.</i>

975
01:03:42,826 --> 01:03:45,620
We're ever so sorry, Piglet.

976
01:03:45,704 --> 01:03:48,498
Aw, the scrapbook's
not that important.

977
01:03:48,498 --> 01:03:51,918
But it showed us
the great things you've done.

978
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:55,630
Oh, l've never done
anything great.

979
01:03:55,714 --> 01:03:59,301
Well, of course you have.
Let's tell him, everyone.

980
01:03:59,426 --> 01:04:01,803
No. Let's show him.

981
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:03,430
That's a wonderful idea.

982
01:04:03,513 --> 01:04:05,515
Come on. Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

983
01:04:05,515 --> 01:04:07,017
Hurry!

984
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,020
I don't know
if I stand the excitement.

985
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,607
- Here we are.
- Ho ho. Go on.

986
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,294
<i>Is that me?</i>

987
01:04:34,294 --> 01:04:35,795
That's you.

988
01:04:35,921 --> 01:04:39,299
- I'm so big.
- Well, of course you are.

989
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:41,510
Why, you're double-XL.
Hoo hoo hoo!

990
01:04:41,635 --> 01:04:42,802
<i>If it weren't for you,
Piglet...</i>

991
01:04:42,802 --> 01:04:44,804
I wouldn't be friends with Roo.

992
01:04:44,804 --> 01:04:48,433
Yeah. Yeah. And thanks for
saving me with the North Pole.

993
01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:50,602
- Oh.
- Piglet...

994
01:04:50,727 --> 01:04:54,731
Pooh Corner's
not a bad place to live.

995
01:04:54,731 --> 01:04:58,026
I'd say this calls
for a celebration.

996
01:04:58,109 --> 01:04:59,528
Hooray!

997
01:05:06,117 --> 01:05:07,619
Hooray! Hooray!

998
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,621
Come on, chase me.

999
01:05:09,704 --> 01:05:11,706
Here I come, Eeyore! Watch out!

1000
01:05:11,832 --> 01:05:14,501
<i>Come on,
you can do better than that.</i>

1001
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:15,794
<i>Hey, where you going?</i>

1002
01:05:15,794 --> 01:05:17,420
Here I come!

1003
01:05:17,504 --> 01:05:18,630
Get him, Roo!

1004
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:19,798
- Oh!
- Roo!

1005
01:05:19,923 --> 01:05:21,424
Oops. Sorry.

1006
01:05:21,508 --> 01:05:23,635
Ha ha ha. That's funny.

1007
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:27,514
<i>That's very funny.</i>

1008
01:05:27,514 --> 01:05:29,307
Uhh! Ohh.

1009
01:05:29,307 --> 01:05:32,310
- Ho ho! Look!
- Piglet, can I try?

1010
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:34,312
Mmm, mmm.

1011
01:05:34,312 --> 01:05:35,897
Oh, my.

1012
01:05:35,897 --> 01:05:38,608
<i>Oh, do something, everyone!</i>

1013
01:05:38,608 --> 01:05:41,111
<i>Oh, uh, um...</i>

1014
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:42,529
Oh, dear!

1015
01:05:42,612 --> 01:05:44,030
<i>Good one, Piglet!</i>

1016
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:45,323
It's carrot cake.

1017
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:49,411
Oh, Rabbit, you're a nut.

1018
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:51,496
Mmm. That's delicious.

1019
01:05:51,496 --> 01:05:53,623
Oh, dear.

1020
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:58,003
- Where's Pooh?
- Piglet!

1021
01:05:58,128 --> 01:06:01,214
Piglet, I have
one more thing to show you.

1022
01:06:01,214 --> 01:06:02,924
But, Pooh, your cake.

1023
01:06:02,924 --> 01:06:05,635
It can wait. Hurry, Piglet.

1024
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:07,512
We shall have
a little something...

1025
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:12,100
right after I show you
a little something, Piglet.

1026
01:06:15,812 --> 01:06:17,105
It's right over here.

1027
01:06:19,816 --> 01:06:22,819
Ohh.

1028
01:06:24,696 --> 01:06:27,616
''Pooh and Piglet Corner.''

1029
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:36,625
Yes, Piglet.

1030
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,210
It's the least we could do...

1031
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:43,632
for a very small Piglet
who's done such very big things.

1032
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:46,510
Thank you, Piglet.

1033
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:44,998
<i>This is fun.</i>

1034
01:10:52,631 --> 01:10:53,632
<i>One more time!</i>
