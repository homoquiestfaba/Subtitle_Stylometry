[Warren] <i>I left you

The reason to be
a part of that is

84
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:55,607
so one day you can walk in the door
of an office you never wanna go in

85
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:57,342
to see a guy you
never wanna meet,

86

on the hopes that he might give you
a job you never wanna fucking do.

87
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:03,047
Something I've often
thought about, is how,

88

my life would've been different
if I hadn't met Warren.

89
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,960

my mom did not want me
to be friends with.

We were not thrilled with
the relationship with Warren,

94
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,075
but we accepted it because...

95
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,276
that was his friend.

96
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,350
You need to have
a little bit of spice...

in the broth.

98
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:45,357
And Warren,
probably was that spice.

People have said that
I was the ring leader,

100
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:51,463
but that's just not true.

101
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,500
There was no ring leader.

Did you know, that 40%

109
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,815

Just thrown away.

He lived here in Kentucky.

175
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,820
He had some misfortune
in business.

176
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:37,689
Went to prison for debt.

177
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,059
When he left prison,
he headed for the wilderness

178
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,328
with a gun, some paint,

179
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,068
and a deep desire to paint
every bird in America.

180
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:50,868
And when he came back
into civilization,

181
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,640
he was acclaimed as one of the
foremost figures in American art.

182
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:57,374
[female student] So, how much
is it worth?

183
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,744
Well, we don't discuss
the worth of our books,

184
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:04,482
but I can assure you, that Mr.
Audubon would never have imagined

185
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:07,288
that his book would be
the most valuable in existence.

186
00:14:08,955 --> 00:14:11,555
Now, most of you are
familiar with this book.

187
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:14,858
Arguably among
the most important ever written.

188
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,494
Darwin's
<i>On The Origin of Species.</i>

189
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:21,134
Please look at line number ten
and tell me what you see.

190
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:24,435
[woman] Species is spelt wrong.

191
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,807
[Betty] That's correct.
Species is...

192
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,144
[enchanting instrumental
music playing]

193
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,857
[Betty]
Will you be joining us, sir?

194
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:53,366
[indistinct chatter]

195
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:01,408
I'm pretty sure he told me
about it at Richard's party.

196
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,477
I remember being cool.

197
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:07,277
A book?

198
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,080
In what world can a book
be worth $12 million?

199
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:11,715
It's not really a book.

200
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:14,685
It's more like
a collection of paintings.

201
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,624
I think I told him
about it in the car.

202
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:19,426
Maybe November. It was cold.

203
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:25,696
I still don't understand how a
book could be worth $12 million.

204
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:29,536
It's like if Picasso
had a bunch of his paintings

205
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,902
in a book.

206
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:34,004
When you say it's in the
library, it's like, what...

207
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:35,205
[clears throat]

208
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:36,641
[chuckles softly]
sitting on a shelf?

209
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:40,945
No, it's in the, uh,
special collections room.

210
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:42,647
Which is what? Like a vault?

211
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:46,550
More like a secure room
with glass cases and stuff.

212
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:48,619
With guards on the doors
and shit?

213
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:51,357
No, but obviously,
you can't just walk in there.

214
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,657
Hey, pull in here.

215
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,295
Because there's
security everywhere?

216
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,230
Not that I saw.

217
00:15:58,631 --> 00:15:59,599
[Warren] Whoa.

218
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,268
What then...

219
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:07,207
Because, you have to make
an appointment.

220
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,292
So, this is how you remember it?

221
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:28,092
Not exactly.

222
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:29,864
But if this his how
Spencer remembers it,

223
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:31,799
then let's go with it.

224
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,504
[Warren] <i>It's $12 million.</i>

225
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:42,742
Could we get it? [chuckling]

226
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:45,877
You know, like,
what would it take?

227
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,216
It would take
extraordinary effort to get it.

228
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:50,918
<i>Not ordinary effort.</i>

229
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:07,400
What?

230
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:09,236
I think you know what.

231
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:17,475
There's been so much, "Who brought it up?
Who kinda started it?"

232
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:19,776
I feel like he was fishing,
[chuckles]

233
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:21,478
and that I took the bait.

234
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,113
It would be true to say that

235
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:25,449
once Warren latches on
to an idea,

236
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:28,721
that he's not easily
going to let it go.

237
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:36,596
[suspenseful music playing]

238
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:43,804
[keys clacking]

239
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,520
[Warren] <i>Look, all I'm saying
is that nothing will happen,</i>

240
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:06,224
<i>unless you
make something happen.</i>

241
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:08,426
We're supposed to be
hunter-gatherers, man.

242
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:11,161
And our whole life,
we're just unwrapping shit.

243
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:13,334
Packaging, packaging, packaging.

244
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:15,836
The illusion of choice.

245
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,001
It's bullshit, man.

246
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:20,270
Everyone in here thinks that
they're gonna win the lottery,

247
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:22,573
but no one likes a ticket.

248
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:27,812
Well, yeah, a prison would be
a nice change of scenery.

249
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:30,113
Well, what about ending up on a
fucking boat in the Caribbean?

250
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:32,016
- [laughs]
- Like the end of <i>Shawshank Redemption.</i>

251
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:32,952
Oh, my God.

252
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:34,620
What about that?

253
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:38,189
He'd been in prison
for 20 years.

254
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:40,490
And sorry to burst
your bubble, but, uh,

255
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:43,494
it doesn't work like that
in real life, Warren.

256
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:46,396
Bad guys, they don't get
to ride off into the sunset

257
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:47,832
- with the money and,
- Wait a second.

258
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:48,932
the gold, and, uh...

259
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:50,104
How will we be the bad guys?

260
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,806
Uh, we'd be the robbers.

261
00:18:58,077 --> 00:18:59,977
Aren't you even curious?

262
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:04,418
Your little, little brain, to find
out what would actually happen?

263
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:08,555
Aren't you curious?

264
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,086
Find out what?

265
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:12,859
To find out what would
really happen in real life.

266
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,497
[sighs]

267
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:22,968
I've lost count.

268
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,635
Can you go, man, please?
I work here, Warren.

269
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:26,970
- I work...
- Listen to me.

270
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:28,408
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

271
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:31,209
I gotta do this shit.

272
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,010
[sighs] We're gonna need
the blueprints.

273
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:35,979
We're gonna need to know
the exits and entry points.

274
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:37,614
We're gonna need to know
the staff entrances

275
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:39,382
and the fastest way out
of the building

276
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:40,953
at any given point in time.

277
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:45,792
What do you say?

278
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:50,530
We're don't need blueprints.

279
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:52,132
We can just draw it.

280
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:58,436
[man on TV]
<i>These guys are fools.</i>

281
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,804
<i>They can't afford
to weasel out on the deal.</i>

282
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:01,838
<i>If they did,
they'd be washed up, okay?</i>

283
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,676
- [man 2] <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Any other questions?</i>

284
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:07,745
Well, let's take
a look at this, then.

285
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:12,350
This is a rough drawing
of the track as I remember.

286
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,552
[Warren]
<i>There aren't exactly books</i>

287
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:17,988
that instruct you
on how to steal [chuckles] art.

288
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,359
I want you to go over this
thing with me inch-by-inch.

289
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,927
Add or subtract
the slightest change,

290
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,630
even if it's something as small as
the placement of a hot dog stand.

291
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:30,203
[Spencer] 5:10, tall, redhead,
librarian one, leaves for the evening.

292
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:35,509
[suspenseful music playing]

293
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:39,442
5:11,

294
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:42,482
short, male administrative
assistant, returns.

295
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:55,996
[Betty] Hold the door, please.

296
00:20:57,363 --> 00:20:59,296
Many of the books
in this library

297
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,602
have been here
since the 19th century.

298
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:23,988
Neither of us were really
serious about the idea.

299
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,157
I took it very seriously
from the start.

300
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,996
[knocking rhythmically]

301
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:34,800
Warren, there's no secret knock.

302
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:37,104
Yeah, well, there should be.

303
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:39,272
Hi.

304
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,076
You lost your fake ID already,
didn't you?

305
00:21:46,078 --> 00:21:49,412
Actually, I came
to talk to you about something.

306
00:21:49,414 --> 00:21:50,817
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

307
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:52,286
What's up?

308
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:54,755
[sighs]

309
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:59,559
What if I have something
to get rid of?

310
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:02,895
What thing
are you talking about?

311
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:05,831
Something rare.

312
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:13,738
So, you're looking for a fence?

313
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,242
I'm looking for a guy who's
gonna buy something rare.

314
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:17,978
Right.

315
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,179
I don't wanna hear anything
about this.

316
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:24,582
But, I know a guy
you might be able to talk to.

317
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:26,017
But I've only met him once.

318
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:28,451
And, I don't know
if I can vouch for him, so...

319
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:30,089
- Do you understand?
- Absolutely, I get it.

320
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:33,859
Okay.

321
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:41,902
[clears throat]

322
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:48,708
He's out in New York.
He does not like phone calls.

323
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:50,977
How do I get in touch with him?

324
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:57,250
- [Spencer] <i>What is this?</i>
- [Warren] <i>That's a fence.</i>

325
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,382
What's a fence?

326
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:00,586
"What's a fence?"

327
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:04,322
A fence is somebody
who buys stolen shit.

328
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:07,424
We're supposed to email that
guy, asking for a meeting,

329
00:23:07,426 --> 00:23:09,994
and sign off
with the name "Terry".

330
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:12,666
And he said to never email
from the same account twice.

331
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,267
How fucking cool is that?

332
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,704
- Good work.
- Thank you.

333
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,679
"Best, Terry."

334
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:27,510
Happy?

335
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:29,048
- I wanna change that...
- Oops.

336
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,317
[Warren chuckling]

337
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:37,121
I just don't get, like, what
a "good faith" payment him is.

338
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:40,990
I mean, we give him
500 bucks for a meeting?

339
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:43,326
It's to show we're serious
and not time-wasters.

340
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:45,895
I would've thought, driving
across the country for 12 hours

341
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,664
was a good demonstration
of that.

342
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,299
It's just how it's done, man.

343
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:52,068
Oh, you know this
from all your previous heists?

344
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,938

He's, uh, he's actually my,

518
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:24,494
my mom's sister's husband,

519
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:27,032
which makes him sort
of, uh, uncle.

520
00:35:31,603 --> 00:35:33,840
You have authentication?

521
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:37,840
[clicks tongue] Okay,
when you say authentication...

522
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:40,342
We take items
from various sources,

523
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:43,412
and we don't inquire
where they came from,

524
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:45,849
as long as
we have authentication

525
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:49,452
with a very famous
auction house.

526
00:35:49,454 --> 00:35:50,854
Yeah, um...

527
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:54,858
So, you're saying, with the
correct authentications,

528
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,364
that these items would be
of interest to you?

529
00:36:00,065 --> 00:36:00,967
Yeah.

530
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,568
[chuckles] So...

531
00:36:04,936 --> 00:36:08,440
Mr. Beckman's gonna be very pleased
about this, by the way. Um...

532
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,441
So, can I ask, roughly,

533
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:14,211
[breathes deeply]

534
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,646
in terms of, um...

535
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:18,985
- It's hard, I imagine, to...
- How much?

536
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:20,085
Yes.

537
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:22,519
How much?

538
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:26,123
Thirty to forty percent
of the valuation price.

539
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:29,728
- That's, um, millions of dollars, right?
- [laughing]

540
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:31,795
Yeah!

541
00:36:31,797 --> 00:36:36,099
Look, I've been thinking
just, uh, you know,

542
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,570
we're gonna need a bigger boat.

543
00:36:40,505 --> 00:36:41,704
We're gonna need a bigger boat?

544
00:36:41,706 --> 00:36:43,542
I mean, we're gonna need
somebody else.

545
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:49,715
Um...

546
00:36:51,682 --> 00:36:53,717
Why do we need someone else?

547
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:56,485
We need somebody with skills
that we don't have.

548
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:58,454
Somebody who's good
with logistics,

549
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:00,891
and, chess.

550
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:05,565
[lecturer] Accepted
accounting principles.

551
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,568
Statements,

552
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,036
on auditing.

553
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:16,005
So, in 1992,

554
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:18,807
we get SAS 82.

555
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,344
Anyone dare to explain
the significance of this one?

556
00:37:21,346 --> 00:37:22,447
[metal music playing
on earphones]

557
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:25,347
Mr. Borsuk.

558
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:26,383
[Eric]
<i>I was majoring in accounting</i>

559
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:28,717
because I wanted a career
at the FBI.

560
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,588
At the time, that was only
one of the two majors

561
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,226
they accepted
straight out of college.

562
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:35,760
[professor]
<i>Eric was a gentleman.</i>

563
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,596
<i>A good student.</i>

564
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:41,597
Gave made no pause,

565
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,802
or concern, uh, whatsoever.

566
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:48,572
I always felt like I was, um,

567
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:50,842
[clicks tongue] kind of a loner,
for some reason.

568
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,445
Um, yeah, um, SAS 82

569
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:58,048
states that
auditors have the duty

570
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,487
to actively look for fraud and not
just report it if they find it.

571
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,787
That's correct.

572
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:05,691
[Eric] Except, in reality, it doesn't
always work like that, does it?

573
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:08,693
Arthur Andersen.

574
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:11,530
Remember them?
Auditors to Enron?

575
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,365
Um, thank you for that,
Mr. Borsuk.

576
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:17,633
[cell phone vibrating]

577
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:21,606
[lecturer] So, in 2002,
that leads us to SAS 99...

578
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:24,106
- [beeps]
- [whispering] Don't cancel me.

579
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:26,108
Shit! What the fuck
are you doing here?

580
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,179
I need to talk to you.

581
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:28,713
But not here.

582
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:34,186
[funky music playing]

583
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:40,824
Warren and I lost touch.
We had a falling out.

584
00:38:40,826 --> 00:38:43,626
Been about three months
since we had last spoken.

585
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:44,963
[Eric] I thought that
we weren't speaking.

586
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:47,764
[Warren] What? Wait.

587
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:50,934
No. Uh, no, no, no, no.

588
00:38:50,936 --> 00:38:53,570
Can we just agree and put all that
stupid shit behind us, please?

589
00:38:53,572 --> 00:38:56,273
I mean, no.

590
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,606
- Hey.
- So, what's up, man?

591
00:38:57,608 --> 00:38:59,008
What's with all the mystery?

592
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,010
I'm here to talk to you
about something deadly serious.

593
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:02,545
I figured
you must want something.

594
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,414
Actually, I came
to offer you something.

595
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:05,885
- Oh, really? Yeah?
- Yeah.

596
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,623
There's no one else
I could trust with this.

597
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,889
You're either in
or you're out, right now.

598
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:14,557
How can I tell you
if I'm in or I'm out

599
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:15,825
without you telling me
the first thing about

600
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:17,293
what I might be in or out of.

601
00:39:17,295 --> 00:39:20,162
I would just need you to say
"in principle," okay?

602
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:23,068
Because this might be something
not exactly legal.

603
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,934
And there's a chance

604
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:27,836
that we would have
to leave everything behind.

605
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:29,972
Okay, when you say
"not legal"...

606
00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:33,045
I'm gonna say this one time,
and one time only.

607
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:36,579
You're either in
or you're out. Right now.

608
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:38,113
I'm gonna need
more than this one.

609
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:39,581
Not till you commit.

610
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:41,219
This would be something
dangerous,

611
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:43,623
and very fucking exciting,

612
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,126
that I need you to be a part of.

613
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:50,896
This could change everything.

614
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:57,269
This is your red pill or
blue pill moment, my friend.

615
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:03,943
How's college?

616
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,079
Would we have to go tonight?

617
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:12,784
I think I was just saying yes,
because I knew that,

618
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,253
I wanted to, um,

619
00:40:16,822 --> 00:40:18,824
regain our friendship
more than anything.

620
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,259
[suspenseful music playing]

621
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:25,662
[Eric] So what's your part?

622
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:28,298
[clears throat] This is
partly where you come in.

623
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,403
Just take a look for me, please.

624
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:37,474
- [Eric] It can't be done at night.
- [laughs] What?

625
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:41,177
What's the one time a day when no
one's supposed to be in the building?

626
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:44,050
It'd be impossible to get in
without triggering the alarms.

627
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,719
It would have to be done
during the day.

628
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:51,090
[Warren] See?

629
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:53,255
I knew you were
the man for this.

630
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:55,157
Look at him.
Just like a fish in water.

631
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,392
Sure.

632
00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:59,331
Let's just walk in there in broad
daylight and rob the place.

633
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,132
Oh, yeah, well,
while you're at it,

634
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:05,034
- you're gonna dynamite the canteen, right?
- [chuckles]

635
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,536
How many cameras,
did you say were

636
00:41:06,538 --> 00:41:08,237
in the special corrections room?

637
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,805
Because they're gonna be
watching everything

638
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:11,407
from the campus safety office.

639
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:13,208
The cameras, the alarms.

640
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,146
They're gonna know
who's coming in and out.

641
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:17,315
What are you doing?

642
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:20,416
I'm taking notes.
This is good stuff.

643
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:21,721
Are you fucking retarded?

644
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,820
No.

645
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:25,655
Why don't you just
email the FBI and ask them

646
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:28,094
where they have access to leave our
fingerprints? You can make it easy for them.

647
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,561
Guys, we need to find out
who's watching

648
00:41:31,563 --> 00:41:33,331
the special collections room
and when.

649
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:37,769
I concur with that

650
00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:41,139
[sighs]

651
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,408
[Bill] Come in.

652
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:47,010
Hey.

653
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:49,181
- Take a seat, Warren.
- Okay.

654
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,219
I assume you know
why you're here.

655
00:41:56,188 --> 00:41:57,155
Uh...

656
00:41:58,389 --> 00:41:59,257
Not really, sir.

657
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,793
Right. Mr. Lipka,

658
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,463
you came here
on an athletic scholarship.

659
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:10,769
Perhaps it doesn't seem like
a particularly big deal to you.

660
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:13,168
No, sir, it does.

661
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,206
Well, son, you have
a funny way of showing it.

662
00:42:16,173 --> 00:42:18,508
Because I warned you
countless times

663
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,010
what would happen if you
continue to fail to show up.

664
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:26,050
Assistant coach suspects drugs
or alcohol may be involved.

665
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,987
Now, it pains me

666
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:35,557
to see you lose
this scholarship.

667
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,166
But it's gonna pain and probably
embarrass your father a whole lot more.

668
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:43,800
So you might wanna reflect on

669
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:46,372
what that kind of disappointment
will mean for him.

670
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:50,976
Yeah.

671
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:54,413
That will be a disappointment.

672
00:42:58,148 --> 00:42:59,150
Thing is,

673
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,389
I worked to get on that team,
since I was about five.

674
00:43:05,322 --> 00:43:08,960
And I have absolutely
no idea why.

675
00:43:11,596 --> 00:43:12,831
To be honest, sir,

676
00:43:14,298 --> 00:43:16,869
I think this whole place
is a disappointment.

677
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:23,108
I think you're
a disappointment.

678
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:27,946
And I think this whole
goddamn town,

679
00:43:29,514 --> 00:43:30,883
is a disappointment.

680
00:43:37,688 --> 00:43:38,824
Get out.

681
00:43:47,264 --> 00:43:48,199
Is that it?

682
00:43:54,438 --> 00:43:56,074
[Warren] <i>The cameras
aren't cameras.</i>

683
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:58,541
<i>They're motion detectors.</i>

684
00:43:58,543 --> 00:44:00,242
<i>We're gonna email the library,</i>

685
00:44:00,244 --> 00:44:04,179
asking to have the <i>Audubon</i>
and the illuminated manuscript

686
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:06,516
on display when we arrive.

687
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,650
They will be here and here.

688
00:44:08,652 --> 00:44:10,720
Can you please not touch
the model?

689
00:44:10,722 --> 00:44:11,590
Thanks.

690
00:44:12,657 --> 00:44:15,023
[sighs] As I was saying.

691
00:44:15,025 --> 00:44:17,961
Back here,
is target priority number one,

692
00:44:17,963 --> 00:44:19,262
the <i>Audubon.</i>

693
00:44:19,264 --> 00:44:21,731
Now, directly behind
the display case is a doorway

694
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:25,601
which leads to a staff elevator
that goes straight to the basement.

695
00:44:25,603 --> 00:44:27,436
Now, once in the basement,

696
00:44:27,438 --> 00:44:30,475
we can access the fire exit
at the side of the building.

697
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,181
Uh, where's the librarian?

698
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:38,918
- [Warren] Thank you.
- Just watch it.

699
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:41,450
The librarian,

700
00:44:41,452 --> 00:44:44,389
is the single biggest risk
to this entire operation.

701
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:49,260
She needs to become a
non-factor as soon as possible.

702
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,267
Now, once inside the room,

703
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:01,436
you two will bag up
the smaller books,

704
00:45:01,438 --> 00:45:04,874
and I'll unlock the cases containing
the Audubon and the Darwin.

705
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:07,110
We should be in and out in less
than three or four minutes.

706
00:45:07,112 --> 00:45:08,911
- Good afternoon. Come in.
- [Spencer] How are you?

707
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:12,914
I'm Betty Jean Gooch, and I will
need your names for the log, please.

708
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:14,686
I am, uh, Spencer Green.

00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:19,014
Wait.

729
00:46:19,016 --> 00:46:20,950
Doesn't work.

730
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:23,219
We need two guys,
at least, in the room.

731
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:24,454
Then you need a third guy,

732
00:46:24,456 --> 00:46:27,623
downstairs in the library,
keeping lookout.

733
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,726
Then, we're gonna have to have
a getaway driver.

734
00:46:29,728 --> 00:46:30,996
Who's your driver?

735
00:46:32,197 --> 00:46:34,396
- The three of us isn't enough.
- He's right.

736
00:46:34,398 --> 00:46:36,465
I just wanna see
how any of this is gonna work.

737
00:46:36,467 --> 00:46:39,637
I mean,
does this seem realistic or...

738
00:46:41,306 --> 00:46:43,409
Well, you got
a better idea, Spence?

739
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:46,679
No. Fuck.

740
00:46:49,114 --> 00:46:52,617
I was torn between
the desire to keep

741
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,550
the adventure going,

742
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:56,619
and waiting for
the insurmountable obstacle,

743
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:58,554
that would,

744
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:02,958
stop everything in its tracks,
and return things to normal.

745
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,827
We need someone else
that we can trust.

746
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:06,632
Wait, wait, wait. Someone else?

747
00:47:08,032 --> 00:47:09,568
You wanna bring in someone else?

748
00:47:10,135 --> 00:47:11,403
You got a better idea?

749
00:47:14,938 --> 00:47:16,307
Who else can we trust with this?

750
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,644
Someone with a fast car.

751
00:47:19,643 --> 00:47:20,678
Or the money to get one.

752
00:47:45,536 --> 00:47:47,936
[Spencer] <i>I'd only met him
a couple of times</i>

753
00:47:47,938 --> 00:47:49,107
<i>in high school.</i>

754
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:53,608
I'd never really got along
too well with Chas.

755
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,246
The decision to bring on the
fourth person came from Eric.

756
00:47:57,248 --> 00:47:58,815
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it was Warren's idea.

757
00:47:58,817 --> 00:48:01,853
I definitely wouldn't have ever
suggested we bring Chas on.

758
00:48:03,855 --> 00:48:05,822
My names is
Charles Thomas Allen II,

759
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:07,392
but, people call me Chas.

760
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:10,760
<i>My dad built me for success.</i>

761
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,929
<i>I started my first company
at 12 years old.</i>

762
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:16,731
At 16, bought my first
real property.

763
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:20,235
He's been a little entrepreneur,
as long as I can remember.

764
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:22,572
You know, mowing grass, uh...

765
00:48:22,574 --> 00:48:24,240
You know, he followed
his dad around.

766
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:25,374
He was a little Tom.

767
00:48:25,376 --> 00:48:27,242
He just followed him
around all the time,

768
00:48:27,244 --> 00:48:28,845
wanting to be, you know,

769
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:31,646
business and, you know,
do everything his dad did.

770
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:35,550
Chas, interestingly enough,
I knew his dad. [laughs]

771
00:48:35,552 --> 00:48:39,889
Uh, he worked out at the same
gym that I did for a while.

772
00:48:39,891 --> 00:48:42,657
Just a wonderful person.

773
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:47,863
Uh, you know, I mean,
a prince of an individual.

774
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:52,637
I think the qualities that we
thought Chas could bring was money.

775
00:48:59,543 --> 00:49:01,476
- [screams]
- Jesus fucking Christ, Warren.

776
00:49:01,478 --> 00:49:03,381
- Stop doing that shit.
- Sorry. [laughs]

777
00:49:03,947 --> 00:49:04,849
Sorry, man.

778
00:49:06,016 --> 00:49:07,650
Can we talk to you
about something?

779
00:49:07,652 --> 00:49:09,151
Yeah, what's up?

780
00:49:09,153 --> 00:49:12,121
[Chas] <i>Once I realized they
were serious about the plan,</i>

781
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:15,157
I thought they were
smoking too much.

782
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:17,126
I think you guys are
smoking too much.

783
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:20,362
And, I thought
they're likely to get themselves

784
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:21,898
in a lot of trouble
and get caught.

785
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,066
And likely to get yourselves
in a lot of trouble,

786
00:49:25,068 --> 00:49:26,202
and get caught.

787
00:49:26,204 --> 00:49:28,436
- Chas?
- Mm-hm?

788
00:49:28,438 --> 00:49:30,942
You really need to see
how easy this is gonna be.

789
00:49:34,244 --> 00:49:36,545
Wait. What the fuck are you guys
even talking about here?

790
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:39,815
We're talking about $12 million

791
00:49:39,817 --> 00:49:41,617
in rare books.

792
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:43,622
And only one old lady
guarding it.

793
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:52,297
[Warren] Names first.

794
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:54,796
Eric, Mr. Black.

795
00:49:54,798 --> 00:49:56,766
Spencer, Mr. Green.

796
00:49:56,768 --> 00:49:57,970
Mr. Yellow, that's me.

797
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:00,771
Chas, Mr. Pink.

798
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:02,741
[giggling]

799
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,106
Fucking really, dude?

800
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:07,443
- What?
- You're making me Mr. Pink?

801
00:50:07,445 --> 00:50:09,912
What? [laughs]
What's wrong with Mr. Pink?

802
00:50:09,914 --> 00:50:13,548
You know exactly what's
wrong with Mr. Pink, okay?

803
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,117
I'm sorry, can I just say
how dumb this entire thing is?

804
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:17,987
Okay?
Because in the motion picture,

805
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:20,623
the whole point of the names was so that
nobody knew what the others were called.

806
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,157
So they couldn't
give each other a...

807
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:23,858
Relax, okay?

808
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,260
It's just protocol,

809
00:50:25,262 --> 00:50:27,665
so we don't address each other
by our names during the robbery.

810
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:29,898
- Okay?
- [Spencer] Mm-hm.

811
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,200
No names.

812
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:33,135
- Mr. Pink.
- It's fucking ridiculous, man.

813
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:35,204
Didn't they all die
in the end of that movie?

814
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:36,706
[Warren] <i>Spencer was Mr. Green,</i>

815
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,974
<i>because he smoked lots
of green.</i>

816
00:50:38,976 --> 00:50:42,280
<i>Eric was Mr. Black because
he said his soul was black.</i>

817
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,313
I was Mr. Yellow because I was,

818
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:47,282
I was my mom's sunshine.

819
00:50:47,284 --> 00:50:51,253
And I named Chas Mr. Pink
just to fuck with him.

820
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:52,822
I'm not gonna be Mr. Pink.

821
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:54,623
I'd be any color but pink.

822
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,358
[chuckles]

823
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,327
It's probably my least favorite
Tarantino film.

824
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:01,262
Okay. Housekeeping first.

825
00:51:01,264 --> 00:51:03,865
Mr. Green, you will see
to the disguises.

826
00:51:03,867 --> 00:51:06,771
Makeup, prosthetics,
outfits, wigs, etcetera.

827
00:51:08,206 --> 00:51:09,838
Costume party?

828
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,639
Making a movie.

829
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:12,807
Mr. Black, your first task,

830
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:14,809
is to find
a reliable getaway vehicle.

831
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:17,146
<i>Ford or similar,
nothing flashy.</i>

832
00:51:17,148 --> 00:51:18,347
Which you will purchase

833
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:20,950
- using cash and a fake ID.
- Yeah, thank you.

834
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,184
Mr. Pink. Your first job,

835
00:51:23,186 --> 00:51:24,787
is to identify
the quickest route

836
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:28,257
from the library
to the drop off point, here.

837
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:30,626
<i>I mean, practice it
over and over again</i>

838
00:51:30,628 --> 00:51:32,396
<i>until it becomes second nature.</i>

839
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:36,532
[tires screeching]

840
00:51:36,534 --> 00:51:38,603
[funky instrumental music
playing]

841
00:51:43,608 --> 00:51:46,675
Fourteen minutes, eighteen
seconds, mostly green lights.

842
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:49,744
Mr. Yellow.
That's me, of course.

843
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:51,981
I will make
the authentication appointment

844
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,315
in New York for the weekend,

845
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:55,050
immediately following
the robbery.

846
00:51:55,052 --> 00:51:57,952
<i>Meaning, that even if
the books are reported missing,</i>

847
00:51:57,954 --> 00:52:00,692
they won't yet show up on the
national index of stolen art.

848
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,526
<i>Once we have
the authentication,</i>

849
00:52:04,528 --> 00:52:08,400
<i>we will arrange a rendezvous with
the buyers in the Netherlands.</i>

850
00:52:11,034 --> 00:52:14,003
[Warren] <i>Dear sir,
my name is Walter Beckman.</i>

851
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:17,273
<i>I'm a collector of rare
manuscripts, based in Texas.</i>

852
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:18,541
<i>I would like to arrange
an appraisal</i>

853
00:52:18,543 --> 00:52:20,809
<i>of some of the items
in my collection.</i>

854
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:24,612
Now, I have emailed the library
to make an appointment

855
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:28,016
to view the books
on the penultimate day of term.

856
00:52:28,018 --> 00:52:29,721
That's eight days from now.

857
00:52:30,554 --> 00:52:32,720
The library
will be almost empty,

858
00:52:32,722 --> 00:52:34,222
as everyone will be in finals.

859
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:35,557
I have an exam that day.

860
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:38,563
- Me too.

Mr. Green, would you like to
walk us through the disguises?

866
00:52:51,976 --> 00:52:56,112
So, the idea is,
we go in disguise as old men.

867
00:52:56,114 --> 00:52:58,646
I'm sorry. Why the fuck would
we go disguised as old men?

868
00:52:58,648 --> 00:53:02,054
Because, being old is the closest
thing to being invisible.

[Eric] I have a question.

870

happen with the librarian.

871
00:53:07,757 --> 00:53:10,358
- Who's gonna be doing...
- We should probably decide that

872
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,795
by drawing lots
or a vote or something.

873
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:14,896

to do with it whatsoever.

do that. I'm not gonna.

No. Of course,

01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:30,025
You okay, Sweetie?

1031
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,862
- Not hungry?
- I'm just tired.

1032
01:06:32,596 --> 01:06:34,095
Exams and stuff.

1033
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:35,867
Honey, you gotta take
better care of yourself.

1034
01:06:38,802 --> 01:06:39,937
Are you sure you're okay?

1035
01:06:43,606 --> 01:06:47,445
I just, uh, I just remembered,
I have an exam tomorrow.

1036
01:06:48,512 --> 01:06:50,314
I didn't study for it, so...

1037
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:56,717
- You okay, champ?
- Spencer. [sighs]

1038
01:06:56,719 --> 01:06:59,956
[woman on headphones] <i>All
limitations are self-imposed.</i>

1039
01:07:01,891 --> 01:07:02,792
Warren.

1040
01:07:07,597 --> 01:07:10,968
- Warren.
- What? What the fuck, man?

1041
01:07:12,568 --> 01:07:13,471
I'm done.

1042
01:07:14,137 --> 01:07:15,603
I'm done.

1043
01:07:15,605 --> 01:07:17,972
[sighs]
I can't see it ending well.

1044
01:07:17,974 --> 01:07:19,277
I just can't go back in there.

1045
01:07:20,476 --> 01:07:22,312
Okay, well, just... All right.

1046
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:25,412
Look, today was bad luck.

1047
01:07:25,414 --> 01:07:27,548
But we got a trial run, okay?

1048
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,050
Now, we can
make adjustments, and...

1049
01:07:30,052 --> 01:07:31,920
Dude, nothing bad
is gonna happen.

1050
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,021
- Nobody's gonna get hurt, nobody's gonna know it's us.
- Stop saying that, Warren!

1051
01:07:34,023 --> 01:07:37,391
"No one's gonna get hurt." How do
you know no one's gonna get hurt?

1052
01:07:37,393 --> 01:07:39,526
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

1053
01:07:39,528 --> 01:07:41,766
I'm talking about
my family, okay?

1054
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:46,700
They're good people
and they don't deserve it.

1055
01:07:46,702 --> 01:07:48,739
Have you even thought about...
I mean...

1056
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:52,907
What could happen, like, if it
goes wrong, with our futures?

1057
01:07:52,909 --> 01:07:55,909
Which fucking future
are you worried about?

1058
01:07:55,911 --> 01:07:59,414
The one that's fucking indistinguishable
from everyone else's?

1059
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:00,715
Where you fucking beaver away

1060
01:08:00,717 --> 01:08:02,416
to get the shit you're told
you need to have

1061
01:08:02,418 --> 01:08:04,385
by some fucking asshole
that's gonna tell you

1062
01:08:04,387 --> 01:08:07,488
what a great big success
you are once you get it all?

1063
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:09,824
Spence, you are the one
who wanted to fucking change.

1064
01:08:09,826 --> 01:08:11,929
You started this
whole thing, remember?

1065
01:08:15,264 --> 01:08:17,665
- Huh?
- Yeah, I do.

1066
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:21,402
But, I think we should just quit
while we're ahead.

1067
01:08:21,404 --> 01:08:24,406
Dude, this isn't fucking
ahead.

1068
01:08:24,408 --> 01:08:26,307
This is just more
of the same shit.

1069
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:28,612
Nothing has changed.
What has changed?

1070
01:08:29,845 --> 01:08:30,714
Tell me.

1071
01:08:37,421 --> 01:08:39,523
I'm just not cut out
for it, Warren.

1072
01:08:41,257 --> 01:08:43,661
Okay? I'm not cut out
for it, so I'm not...

1073
01:08:45,095 --> 01:08:46,061
I'm done.

1074
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:47,498
- Look, you just...
- I'm done.

1075
01:08:48,597 --> 01:08:50,634
You really wanna come
all this way,

1076
01:08:51,701 --> 01:08:53,570
and not find out
what happens next?

1077
01:08:58,707 --> 01:09:03,380
I mean, tell me this hasn't been
the time of your fucking life.

1078
01:09:07,516 --> 01:09:12,286
Man, I don't want you waking up,
ten years from now

1079
01:09:12,288 --> 01:09:14,125
wondering what
could've happened.

1080
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:17,527
And who you could've been.

1081
01:09:22,865 --> 01:09:23,934
[sighs] Fine.

1082
01:09:26,636 --> 01:09:27,838
I'll see you around, man.

1083
01:09:35,377 --> 01:09:36,813
One day, you'll be dead!

1084
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:40,885
[suspenseful music playing]

1085
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:06,877
[panting]

1086
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,146
[Spencer]
<i>You can go through life,</i>

1087
01:10:45,148 --> 01:10:49,616
with this expectation that something
fantastic is gonna happen.

1088
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:53,656
Something life-altering, that's gonna
make your life different and unique.

1089
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:05,836
<i>I realized that I had to,</i>

1090
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:09,974
actually make something happen
on my own.

1091
01:11:12,274 --> 01:11:14,711
So, plan B.

1092
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:18,478
We've agreed that Chas
will be the driver.

1093
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,449
He stays in the van with the engine
running, and the doors open.

1094
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:25,719
Myself and Eric, will be the only
ones to go inside the library.

1095
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:28,121
No disguises. It just
creates unwanted attention.

1096
01:11:28,123 --> 01:11:29,025
What about him?

1097
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:33,530
Spencer will be outside
on lookout.

1098
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:35,129
What, why?

1099
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:37,464
Well, he can't go inside.
People will recognize him.

1100
01:11:37,466 --> 01:11:38,866
We can't risk that.

1101
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:41,268
So, then who's gonna be
the lookout inside the library?

1102
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:42,336
[Warren] You.

1103
01:11:42,338 --> 01:11:43,470
You're gonna be downstairs

1104
01:11:43,472 --> 01:11:45,072
until I call you
to come bag up the books.

1105
01:11:45,074 --> 01:11:47,808
You know that I can't be involved in
dealing with the librarian, right?

1106
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,677
- You get that?
- Like I said,

1107
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:51,079
I will take care of that,

1108
01:11:51,081 --> 01:11:53,951
and then I will call you
once she's been...

1109
01:11:55,284 --> 01:11:56,819
She's neutralized.

1110
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,059
This time, it's gonna work.

1111
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:07,027
Okay, so, when I go up,

1112
01:12:07,029 --> 01:12:09,199
she'll be dealt with.
It'll be done?

1113
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:12,603
Yes, Warren?

1114
01:12:13,603 --> 01:12:14,939
It's what I just said.

1115
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:16,639
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

1116
01:12:25,614 --> 01:12:26,750
[van door opens]

1117
01:12:40,529 --> 01:12:42,065

01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:43,159
[breathes heavily]

1122
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:53,137
[exhales sharply]

1123
01:14:14,757 --> 01:14:17,125
- Mr. Beckman.
- Yes, hi. Walter Beckman.

1124
01:14:17,127 --> 01:14:19,227
Yes, Betty Jean Gooch.
Nice to see you.

1125
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:20,695
- Nice to see you, too.
- Come in, please.

1126
01:14:20,697 --> 01:14:25,232
I have to say,
I expected someone much older.

1127
01:14:25,234 --> 01:14:28,302
- [chuckles]
- [laughs nervously] Yeah, you never know, do you?

1128
01:14:28,304 --> 01:14:30,405
No, you never know.

1129
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:34,244
Now, I'm gonna ask you
to sign in for the log,

1130
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,446
by your printed name.

1131
01:14:39,448 --> 01:14:41,115
- Right there, thank you.
- Thank you.

1132
01:14:41,117 --> 01:14:42,820
And then,
if you would date it, please.

1133
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:46,724
[Betty] <i>And how is
your day going, thus far?</i>

1134
01:14:47,356 --> 01:14:48,688
It's going fine, thank you.

1135
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,592
Um, I'm very sorry about
the other evening.

1136
01:14:51,594 --> 01:14:54,027
Uh, the other day,
[laughs nervously] sorry.

1137
01:14:54,029 --> 01:14:56,863
We, uh... I had a family
emergency I had to take care of.

1138
01:14:56,865 --> 01:14:58,098
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1139
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,201
- Yeah.
- I trust everything is okay.

1140
01:15:00,203 --> 01:15:02,836
- It's okay now, thank you.
- Good.

1141
01:15:02,838 --> 01:15:05,173
Well, what you have
requested to see,

1142
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:08,843
are among our most
treasured items.

1143
01:15:08,845 --> 01:15:11,646
I have laid out
the illuminated manuscript

1144
01:15:11,648 --> 01:15:15,782
and the <i>Hortus Sanitatis</i>
on my left.

1145
01:15:15,784 --> 01:15:17,919
Please remember to use
the gloves at all times

1146
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:20,324
while touching any of the pages.

1147
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:21,958
Sure.

1148
01:15:23,091 --> 01:15:26,693
Uh, is this a personal
interest of yours,

1149
01:15:26,695 --> 01:15:29,263
or are you working on
some kind of a project?

1150
01:15:29,265 --> 01:15:32,336
Uh, I just, um,
heard a great deal about them.

1151
01:15:33,269 --> 01:15:34,968
Ah.

1152
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:37,871
Well, as you can see, one of
the volumes of the Audubon

1153
01:15:37,873 --> 01:15:39,706
is displayed here.

1154
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:42,175
This case will remain locked
at all times.

1155
01:15:42,177 --> 01:15:45,213
However, if you do wish to see
some of the other plates,

1156
01:15:45,215 --> 01:15:48,249
I can help you to turn
some of the pages,

1157
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:49,186
if time permits.

1158
01:16:08,003 --> 01:16:09,439
[cell phone vibrating]

1159
01:16:19,015 --> 01:16:20,150
You can come up now.

1160
01:16:37,065 --> 01:16:39,101
[suspenseful music continues]

1161
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:44,507
[breathing heavily]

1162
01:16:49,244 --> 01:16:50,113
[clears throat]

1163
01:17:14,904 --> 01:17:17,241
[Warren] Ms. Gooch, uh,
my friend is right there.

1164
01:17:17,472 --> 01:17:18,341
Oh.

1165
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:20,911
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

1166
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,324
Hello. Come in, please.

1167
01:17:39,228 --> 01:17:42,062
I will need your name
for the log book.

1168
01:17:42,064 --> 01:17:44,333
You need to sign in, John.

1169
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:45,935
[Betty] John.

1170
01:17:48,537 --> 01:17:49,438
John?

1171
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:53,277
Rutherford.

1172
01:17:58,213 --> 01:18:00,313
- Please sign by the...
- [muffled screaming]

1173
01:18:00,315 --> 01:18:02,950
- Warren, what are you doing?
- [Betty groans]

1174
01:18:02,952 --> 01:18:06,053
No, no, no! That's hurting me!

1175
01:18:06,055 --> 01:18:08,321
- I'm sorry. Just relax, all right?
- No, I can't. I got to get out.

1176
01:18:08,323 --> 01:18:10,156
- We're here for the books. We're not gonna hurt you.
- No! [crying]

1177
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:11,959
Just relax. This will all
be over in a second.

1178
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:14,695
[Betty] No, no, I can't.

1179
01:18:14,697 --> 01:18:17,732
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

1180
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,032
We're not gonna hurt you.

1181
01:18:19,034 --> 01:18:21,035
You keep struggling,
it's gonna fucking hurt more.

1182
01:18:21,037 --> 01:18:22,202
- [muffled crying]
- Shut up!

1183
01:18:22,204 --> 01:18:25,606
- Oh, God. Oh, God, help me.
- Tie her legs.

1184
01:18:25,608 --> 01:18:27,842
[Betty crying]

1185
01:18:27,844 --> 01:18:31,044
Start tying her fucking legs,
right now!

1186
01:18:31,046 --> 01:18:33,947
[Betty] Don't tie my hands.
Please, I can't...

1187
01:18:33,949 --> 01:18:36,250
- I can't have my hands tied.
- Goddamn it.

1188
01:18:36,252 --> 01:18:39,586
- [Betty] God, help me.
- Shit. Shit.

1189
01:18:39,588 --> 01:18:41,455
[Warren] Drop the fucking gloves.
What are you doing?

1190
01:18:41,457 --> 01:18:43,857
- [Betty] I just wanna go. I just wanna go.
- Let's go! Let's go!

1191
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:45,291
Just relax, all right?

1192
01:18:45,293 --> 01:18:47,193
- I can't breathe. You're hurting me.
- Can you be calm?

1193
01:18:47,195 --> 01:18:49,332
I'm not gonna fucking hurt...
Oh, shit.

1194
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:54,434
- Fuck!
- Why? Why are you doing this?

1195
01:18:54,436 --> 01:18:57,039
- Why?
- [Warren] It's the books. We want the books.

1196

Get the fucking books,

What the fuck?

1218
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:58,125
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's moving towards the door.

1219
01:20:58,127 --> 01:21:00,059
I'm not fucking touching her.

I'm done touching her.
That's it.

- I'm done. I don't give a fuck.
- Goddamn it, I gotta do everything, my fucking self.

1223
01:21:07,002 --> 01:21:08,537
I'm not fucking

[moaning]

1225
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:14,344
All right, that's it.

[Warren] Wait, we need
another one. Another one.

01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,472
What the fuck are you talking about?
This shit could be the fucking thing.

Leave it. Fucking leave it.

What the fuck?

1258
01:23:41,423 --> 01:23:43,627
- Wait here. Hold the door.
- It's pitch-black. Fuck.

1259
01:23:45,293 --> 01:23:48,594
[Eric] Goddamn it, Warren. This
isn't supposed to be like this.

1260
01:23:48,596 --> 01:23:52,232
[Warren] Oh, shit.
Where's the exit?

- [Eric] I don't know!
- Fuck!

1267

What the fuck?
What are we gonna do?

1268
01:24:09,752 --> 01:24:11,184
- We have to make a run for it.
- What?

1269
01:24:11,186 --> 01:24:13,419
- We gotta make a run for it.
- What do you mean, "make a run for it"?

1270
01:24:13,421 --> 01:24:15,789
- We need to make a fucking run for it.
- They're gonna fucking see us.

1271

Warren, what the fuck
are you doing?

1285
01:24:55,597 --> 01:24:56,466
Shit.

1286
01:24:59,034 --> 01:25:01,537
Hey, stop! Fucking idiot, stop!

1287

[Eric] Fucking go, go, go, go.

01:25:06,408 --> 01:25:08,644
Hey, Eric,
where are the books, huh?

1289
01:25:10,378 --> 01:25:11,715
Where the fuck is Warren?

Slow down.
You gotta fucking cool it.

1300
01:25:44,613 --> 01:25:46,013
Don't tell me
what the fuck to do.

01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,120
We dropped the fucking books!

1304
01:25:53,122 --> 01:25:54,720
Okay, Chas?
There's no fucking books!

1305
01:25:54,722 --> 01:25:57,124
- What are you telling me? We got nothing?
- We fucking dropped them!

1306
01:25:57,126 --> 01:25:59,559
- They fell out of our hands.
- We got fucking nothing.

1307
01:25:59,561 --> 01:26:01,727
Nothing, there's nothing.
Shut the fuck up!

1308

- [Chas] Hey, fuck you, man.
- [Eric] Please.

1309
01:26:03,265 --> 01:26:05,232
[Chas] If you got nothing, why
did you take so long up there?

1310
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:08,000
What the fuck happened
up there, man?

1311
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:10,103
You know, fuck the both of you.
You guys fucked this up again.

1312
01:26:10,105 --> 01:26:12,539
I knew it, I knew you were

[Eric stammering]
You didn't fucking go in there.

Please, give me

Your fucking backpack,
man. Check it!

1319
01:26:42,637 --> 01:26:43,939
[Chas] What's he got?
He got something?

01:26:44,974 --> 01:26:45,906
Yeah.

[siren blaring]

1322
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:10,998
What are you doing?

1323
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,566
- Get out.
- What?

1324
01:27:12,568 --> 01:27:14,668
What are you fucking talking about? I'm
not getting out of the fucking car.

1325
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,838
Dude, they're gonna be looking for a gray
van with three guys in it, okay? Get out.

1326
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,240
- What the fuck is this, man?
- Get the fuck out, man!

1327
01:27:20,242 --> 01:27:23,076
Hey, I'm not moving this car with
the three of us in it. Get out!

1328
01:27:23,078 --> 01:27:24,678
- I'm not getting out of here...
- Get out!

1329
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,979
I'll come back for you. I will
come back for you in my car.

1330
01:27:26,981 --> 01:27:28,415
- Just get the fuck out.
- You fucking promise?

1331
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:30,450
- You're not gonna leave us here.
- I swear to fucking God I'll come back.

1332
01:27:30,452 --> 01:27:33,019
- I'm not getting out...
- Get out! Get out!

1333
01:27:33,021 --> 01:27:35,188
Eric, get the fuck out
of the fucking door!

1334
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:37,559
Get the fuck... Get the fuck out.

1335
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,195

Please take your fucking bag.

Close the fucking doors.
Hurry the fuck up.

Fuck.

[suspenseful music continues]

1340
01:28:23,605 --> 01:28:25,037
- [sighs]
- Okay.

1341
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:27,174
You gotta watch this, okay, buddy?
Fucking guard this.

1342
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:29,879
Give me your clothes.
Give me your fucking clothes.

1343
01:28:44,726 --> 01:28:46,593
You can't stay here, okay?

1344
01:28:46,595 --> 01:28:48,097
Get your shit. Let's fucking go.

1345
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:50,532
Get it together. Let's go.

1346
01:28:58,373 --> 01:29:01,907
There is a special collection
room inside of this library.

1347
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:04,443
Now, we're told that some of
the books inside that room

1348
01:29:04,445 --> 01:29:06,545
<i>date back to the 1700s.</i>

1349
01:29:06,547 --> 01:29:08,682
<i>They're very rare
and expensive.</i>

1350
01:29:08,684 --> 01:29:10,683
<i>This morning, two men
took advantage of that.</i>

what they were looking for.</i>

1357

for the two men who stole the books,</i>

1358
01:29:29,938 --> 01:29:32,571
<i>and the two men who drove
the getaway vehicle.</i>

1359
01:29:32,573 --> 01:29:34,206

- Quiet!

regarding the provenance
of the books?

1376

Only that he inherited them
many years ago.

value through a private sale.

1378
01:31:00,628 --> 01:31:01,730
Right.

1379

Yeah, [stutters]

they fully deserve.

Um, I mean, they've been
in his family for generations,

1386
01:31:31,025 --> 01:31:34,396

no documentation to speak of.

1388

1389

with Mr. Leckey,

1390

- Melanie Halloran.

1396
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:08,027
Ms. Halloran, we are really
hoping to supply Mr. Beckman

1397
01:32:08,029 --> 01:32:12,835

1398

That's why we came up here.

1399
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:18,537

give you that

1400

without Mr. Leckey's sign off.

1401
01:32:20,141 --> 01:32:22,709
And no one else who could
maybe take a look today?

1402
01:32:22,711 --> 01:32:25,144
As I say, this is really
Thomas' department.

1403
01:32:25,146 --> 01:32:27,647
And he'll be back here tomorrow.

1404
01:32:27,649 --> 01:32:29,986
Is there a number we can reach
you on while you're in town?

1405
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,553
Ah, fuck.

1406
01:32:33,555 --> 01:32:34,423

- And?

1408
01:32:36,925 --> 01:32:42,195
The main guy wasn't there, so we had to
talk to the, uh, junior executive...

1409
01:32:42,197 --> 01:32:43,463

She said what we got
is very valuable

1412
01:32:49,104 --> 01:32:53,339
and, uh, we just gotta wait
for the main guy to get back.

1413
01:32:53,341 --> 01:32:57,076
So, we gotta wait for the call, and
then we can get in touch with the...

1414
