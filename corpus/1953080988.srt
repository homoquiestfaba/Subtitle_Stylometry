1
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:40,668
Liberty`s moving.

2
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:43,148
The 10:15 event`s been moved inside
to the Indian Treaty room.

3
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:45,148
10:15 is American Fisheries?

4
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:47,748
Yes, sir. They`re giving you
a 200-pound haIibut.

5
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:50,108
Janie, make a note.
We need to scheduIe more events...

6
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,228
where somebody gives me
a reaIIy big fish.

7
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:54,548
- Yes, sir.
- Janie, I`m kidding.

8
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:56,548
- Hey, Cooper.
- Morning, Mr. President.

9
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:01,708
Mr. RothschiId asked to have
a moment with you this morning, sir.

10
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:04,028
Is he upset
about the speech Iast night?

11
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:06,508
He seemed concerned.

12
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:09,188
It wouIdn`t be a Monday morning
unIess Lewis was concerned...

13
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,588
about something I did Sunday night.

14
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:14,428
- You skipped a whoIe paragraph!
- And Monday morning it is.

15
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:17,748
""Americans can no Ionger afford to
pretend they Iive in a great society--""

16
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:20,628
And then you dumped
the whoIe handguns paragraph.

17
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,788
This is a time
for prudence, Lewis.

18
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,908
But, sir, that was
the kick-ass section.

19
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:27,188
WeII, I thought what with being
president and aII--

20
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:29,108
I didn`t mean to impIy--

21
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:31,508
I thought you`d be turning
cartwheeIs this morning, Lewis.

22
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:34,388
- 63% job approvaI.
- That is good news, sir.

23
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:36,668
- Morning, Mr. President.
- Morning, CharIie.

24
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:38,988
Sir, the press is gonna need
an expIanation.

25
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:41,908
- For what?
- Because you dumped the whoIe section.

26
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,868
- Now we`ve got this thing hanging out.
- There`s this thing hanging out?

27
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:48,428
""Americans can no Ionger afford to
pretend they Iive in a great society--""

28
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:51,108
And then nothing.
No expIanation, no context.

29
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:54,188
- It`s just this thing.
- And it`s hanging out?

30
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,628
- Yes, sir.
- Maria.

31
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,548
- Good morning, sir.
- I`m gonna need--

32
00:03:57,628 --> 00:03:59,468
OveraII consumer spending
and not just first homes?

33
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,388
- We`II have it for you in 15 minutes.
- Thanks.

34
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:03,188
Mr. President, I reaIIy feeI--

35
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:06,348
However much coffee you drink,
I want you to reduce it by haIf.

36
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:10,068
- I don`t drink coffee, sir.
- Then hit yourseIf with a basebaII bat.

37
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:11,988
- Yes, sir.
- Happy birthday, Laura.

38
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,908
- Laura, happy birthday.
- Thank you, sir.

39
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,068
- I shouId send her some fIowers.
- You aIready did, sir.

40
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:18,348
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- How are you today, Mrs. ChapiI?

41
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:22,388
Fine, sir. Mr. Kodak Ieft a detaiIed
breakdown of the approvaI poII for you.

42
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:24,508
He seemed to indicate
that it was very good news.

43
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:26,548
Sixty-three percent of it,
at any rate.

44
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:30,268
Lucy caIIed just a moment ago.
You forgot to sign her permission sIip.

45
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,188
Ah, the museum trip.
I`II go get it, sir.

46
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,188
- What time is she getting home?
- 3:20.

47
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:36,108
- How`s my afternoon Iook?
- Very crowded.

48
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,748
ScheduIe some time at 3:45.

49
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:41,828
Too-taII McCaII!
So how was Mexico?

50
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,748
I didn`t appreciate it
untiI I came back...

51
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:46,188
and discovered that America
isn`t a great society.

52
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:47,908
He dumped a whoIe section.

53
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,908
Now there`s this thing
hanging out?

54
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,668
Not a great society, sir?

55
00:04:51,748 --> 00:04:54,428
With you out of the country, it wasn`t.
Now that you`re back, we`re great again.

56
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:57,668
There`s a pressroom fuII of peopIe
saying, ""What did he mean by that?""

57
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:01,268
- A.J., did you get one of these?
- The Ietter from SoIomon at the G.D.C.?

58
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,828
It appears to be a Ietter
from the entire environmentaI community.

59
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:06,748
- These peopIe are out of controI.
- WeII, they`re frustrated.

60
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,148
Are they bIaming the president
for gIobaI warming?

61
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,628
They don`t think he caused it.
I`m on the phone with them twice a week.

62
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,268
I honestIy don`t know
what they want at this point.

63
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,988
They want a 20% reduction
in fossiI fueI emissions.

64
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,428
- It won`t pass at 20%.
- WeII, we haven`t reaIIy tried.

65
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:23,748
McSorIey, McCIusky and Shane
hoId too many markers.

66
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:27,548
If we try to push this through and Iose,
there wiII be a very Ioud thud...

67
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,268
and that`s not what you want
in an eIection year.

68
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:32,108
TaIk to the G.D.C. again.

69
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:34,108
TeII them the president
resents the impIication...

70
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:36,068
he`s turned his back
on the environment.

71
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:39,988
I`II send 455 to the fIoor,
but I`II ask for a 10% reduction.

72
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:41,908
If they want to puII
their support, fine.

73
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:45,388
With a 63% job approvaI rating, I don`t
need their heIp to get a biII passed.

74
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:48,628
- Good deaI.
- Let`s get going. Where`s Leon?

75
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,228
John, caII Mr. Kodak
and teII him the president`s waiting.

76
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,628
Sorry. My fauIt.

77
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,788
Never mind, John.

78
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:59,828
Excuse me.
Good morning, Mr. President.

79
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:02,508
- Are you aII right?
- They keep moving that big ficus pIant.

80
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,068
We`re aII here, Mr. President.

81
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,548
First of aII, I wanted to say
congratuIations.

82
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:12,268
Three years ago, we were eIected by one
of the narrowest margins in history...

83
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,548
and today, Kodak teIIs us...

84
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:17,428
63% of registered voters
think we`re doing a good job.

85
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:21,028
Wait a second.
You wanted me to poII registered voters?

86
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:23,548
The poII aIso teIIs us
what we aIready know.

87
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,668
If we don`t get our crime biII
through Congress...

88
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,708
those numbers
are gonna be a memory.

89
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,148
So starting today,
we`re shifting it into gear.

90
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:32,468
Can I teII my morning press gaggIe
that gun controI--

91
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:35,908
""Crime controI,"" Robin.
""Gun controI"" means we`re soft on crime.

92
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:39,308
WeII, hang on. Are we not putting back
the handgun restrictions?

93
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:41,188
No, we`re Ieaving them out.

94
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:44,548
Mr. President,
we campaigned on this issue.

95
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:47,948
We took them out when we were in the
40s, but we couId push it through now.

96
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:49,828
After the eIections, Lewis.

97
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,308
We may never have
an opportunity Iike this again.

98
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:56,148
Sir, Iet`s take this 63% out for a spin.
Let`s see what it couId do.

99
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:58,628
We can`t take it out for a spin.
We need it to get reeIected.

100
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:03,028
For reasons I don`t understand, peopIe
do not reIate guns to gun-reIated crime.

101
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:05,028
Robin, you can brief the press
this afternoon.

102
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:08,828
As of today, the crime biII is priority
one on the president`s domestic agenda.

103
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,108
- Got it.
- Leon, you`re gonna run the war room.

104
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:14,628
We`II need projections for aII the
target districts by the end of the week.

105
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,588
Oh, and don`t be the sweet,
nice guy from BrookIyn on this one.

106
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:20,548
- Do what the N.R.A. does.
- Scare the shit out of them?

107
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:22,668
- ExactIy.
- I can do that.

108
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:25,788
We want you to be IegisIative Iiaison.
You`re gonna run the show on the HiII.

109
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:27,748
Can I just say, to return
to the subject for one moment...

110
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,828
that it might be easier to fight drugs
if we weren`t arming drug deaIers?

111
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,188
We gotta fight the fights
we can win, Lewis.

112
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:36,948
- Yes, sir.
- We want to announce the crime biII...

113
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:39,268
at the State of the Union,
which is 72 days from today.

114
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:41,348
Last count put us
18 votes short.

115
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,908
Eighteen votes in 72 days.
Thank you, everyone.

116
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:48,628
- What`s next?
- Security briefing, sir.

117
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,108
Good morning. GIobaI Defense CounciI.

118
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,748
You wanted to see me?

119
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:02,748
- I just spoke with A.J. MacInerney.
- Did the president read the Ietter?

120
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:05,548
The president`s pissed as heII.
That Ietter was a stupid move.

121
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:08,188
It was aggressive, and I think
we shouId stand by every word--

122
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,588
This isn`t the guy who needed our heIp.
He`s incredibIy popuIar.

123
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:14,868
He`s gonna win reeIection, and
he couId give a shit what we stand by!

124
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:19,308
If the president passes history`s most
important environmentaI IegisIation...

125
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:22,548
despite our negative endorsement,
our future poIiticaI weight...

126
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,748
wiII rank somewhere beIow
the Save the Spotted OwI Society.

127
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,788
I`m bringin` in some heIp.

128
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:34,068
We don`t need another environmentaI
expert to confirm what every other--

129
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:38,148
Not an environmentaI expert.
A professionaI poIiticaI strategist.

130
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:41,228
We`re pIaying hardbaII with Andrew
Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat.

131
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:44,188
- Who?
- Syndey EIIen Wade.

132
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:48,308
Christ, Leo! That woman doesn`t know
anything about the environmentaI Iobby!

133
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:51,388
She`s a cIoser, Susan.
She gets the job done.

134
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,268
- What if I Iose this?
- Then move this up here.

135
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:58,908
David Sasser from the Times wants to
know what you think is a great society.

136
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,308
-What did you teII him?
-That I can`t speak for the president...

137
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:03,108
but for my money, Bermuda.

138
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:05,748
- Perfect.
- Your cousin Judith has the fIu...

139
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,668
and won`t be abIe
to join you Thursday night.

140
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,148
I`m sorry to hear that.
Remind me to caII her Iater today.

141
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,068
- Yes, sir.
- You gonna go stag?

142
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:14,188
- Is that a probIem?
- No, we`ve never gone wrong...

143
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:16,588
parading you around
as the IoneIy widower.

144
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:24,828
I can`t beIieve I said that. That was
an incredibIy thoughtIess remark.

145
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,788
I wouId never dream of insuIting you
or the memory of your wife.

146
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,188
That`s okay. Forget it.
What time is it?

147
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,188
It`s 3:30, sir.

148
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:34,468
I`m gonna go up
and say hi to Lucy.

149
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:37,468
You have the attorney generaI at 4:00
and the trade rep at 4:30.

150
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:40,308
- And you promised N.P.R. five minutes.
- Mr. President?

151
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:43,268
Robin, don`t worry about it.

152
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:06,548
Don`t stop. It sounds great.
What is it?

153
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:08,628
ScaIes.

154
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,188
WeII, you`re pIaying with gusto.

155
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:13,668
- Are my Iips swoIIen?
- Are they supposed to be?

156
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:15,708
- Yeah.
- WeII, you`re doin` just fine.

157
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:19,108
- What ya got behind your back?
- I have a IittIe surprise for you.

158
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:22,148
- Is it a dirt bike?
- No.

159
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,108
Is it a reaIIy oId seventh grade
textbook of yours...

160
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:31,748
that you`re gonna make me discuss
at dinner and drive me crazy--

161
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:36,068
I`m not comfortabIe with the ""reaIIy
oId"" part, but everything eIse was true.

162
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,988
Understanding the Constitution.

163
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:42,148
Your sociaI studies teacher said your
cIass wiII be studying the Constitution.

164
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:43,668
You taIked to Mr. Linder?

165
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:45,708
Yes. It`s caIIed
a parent-teacher conference.

166
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:49,188
Mr. Linder and I were
the key pIayers in the discussion.

167
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,308
So why don`t you Iike
sociaI studies?

168
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:53,068
I Iike it fine, Dad.

169
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:56,548
AII your other teachers say
you`re happy, enthusiastic.

170
00:10:56,628 --> 00:10:59,028
Mr. Linder says you never participate
unIess he caIIs on you...

171
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,508
and even then
it`s a one-word answer.

172
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,068
I don`t know, Dad.
I guess I`m just not--

173
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:08,988
I don`t know.

174
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,068
Luce, take a Iook at this book.

175
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:17,548
This is exciting stuff.
It`s about who we are and what we want.

176
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,868
Read what it says
on the first page.

177
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,748
""Property of GiImore Junior High.""

178
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:24,668
The next page, Luce.

179
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:30,828
""We the peopIe of the United States,
in order to form a more perfect union--""

180
00:11:30,908 --> 00:11:33,948
See what I mean? It grabs you right
off the bat. This is a page-turner.

181
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:37,628
- I can`t wait.
- WeII, good because...

182
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,548
this subject may come up at dinner.

183
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,708
Do you see it as your job
to torture me?

184
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:44,908
No, just one of the perks.
See you tonight, honey.

185
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:55,548
The C-STAD hardware`s
been in pIace for a month.

186
00:11:55,628 --> 00:12:00,388
We have 22 instructors from the Army
waiting to train the IsraeIis.

187
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:03,588
- How soon can you depIoy them?
- We can airIift them in the morning.

188
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:05,828
They`II have C-STAD operationaI
in 20 days.

189
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:07,148
Any security concerns?

190
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,908
If anybody wanted to hit it,
they`d have hit it by now.

191
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,268
Okay, Iet`s move on it.
Thank you, gentIemen.

192
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,748
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Good night, John.

193
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:17,308
- Thank you.
- Good night, sir.

194
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,908
- Good seeing you.
- You too. Good night.

195
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:23,588
Have a good evening, Mrs. ChapiI.
Janie, I`II see you tomorrow morning.

196
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:25,748
- You wiII, Mr. President.
- Good night, Janie, Mrs. ChapiI.

197
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,628
- Mr. President, sir.
- Thank you.

198
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,068
- Leo SoIomon brought in a hired gun.
- It`s about time.

199
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:34,708
She`s a Iawyer from Virginia.
Her name is Sydney EIIen Wade.

200
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:38,468
I know her pretty weII. She`s had a Iot
of success getting congressmen eIected.

201
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,708
Maybe we shouId try to steaI her.

202
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:45,068
Ten percent, A.J. Don`t Iet them Ieave
the room tiII they`re cIear about that.

203
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,388
If you`ve got a free second,
maybe you couId stop in and say heIIo.

204
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,668
- It might smooth the way.
- Mention it to Janie tomorrow.

205
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:54,948
- Good deaI.
- And Iet`s focus on the crime biII.

206
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,628
I don`t want to just win this one.
I want to win by a coupIe of touchdowns.

207
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,628
We wiII, Mr. President.

208
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:07,548
Robin said something to me today, and
I know she wouIdn`t have said it if--

209
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,748
I mean, she wasn`t saying it
to me, I reaIize.

210
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:17,188
Forget it.
I`II see you in the morning.

211
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:18,948
- Good night, Mr. President.
- A.J.?

212
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,948
- Yes, sir?
- When we`re out of the office...

213
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:23,628
and aIone,
you can caII me Andy.

214
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,188
- I beg your pardon?
- You were the best man at my wedding.

215
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,828
- CaII me Andy.
- Whatever you say, Mr. President.

216
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,468
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, A.J.

217
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:49,588
- Hi, I`m Sydney EIIen Wade.
- He just needs your driver`s Iicense.

218
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,228
- I`m from Virginia.
- He doesn`t care.

219
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:54,188
- I have a meeting with Mr. MacInerney.
- He doesn`t need to know.

220
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:58,788
Forgive me. This is my first time
at the White House.

221
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:00,828
I`m trying to savor
the ""Capra-esque"" quaIity.

222
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,748
He doesn`t know
what ""Capra-esque"" means.

223
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:05,828
Yeah, I do. Frank Capra,
great American director.

224
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:09,108
It`s a WonderfuI Life,
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

225
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:12,268
Sydney EIIen Wade of Virginia,
knock `em dead.

226
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:14,188
Thanks.

227
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:18,988
...government subsidizes private schooIs
is when we give up on pubIic education.

228
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:22,548
The proposaI onIy scratches the surface,
but it`s the Ieast we can do.

229
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,428
We`II Iet HaroId take a Iook at this.
We`II revisit it next week.

230
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:28,308
Say heIIo to Linda, and
have a good Thanksgiving hoIiday.

231
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:31,108
Thank you, Mr. President.

232
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:33,988
- So how are we doing?
- You`re four minutes ahead of scheduIe.

233
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:37,388
Ahead? Gee, that`s unprecedented.
I don`t know what to do with myseIf.

234
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:41,548
- Mr. MacInerney asked me to teII you--
- Oh, right, the G.D.C. meeting.

235
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:44,428
Rest assured, your concerns
are not faIIing on deaf ears.

236
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:48,388
The environmentaI Iobby has known
no greater aIIy than President Shepherd.

237
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:51,388
HardIy an impressive
distinction, A.J.

238
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:54,548
Sydney, we shouId Ieave Mr. MacInerney
aIone now. He`s given us--

239
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,908
Mr. MacInerney doesn`t
want us to Ieave him aIone...

240
00:14:56,988 --> 00:15:00,588
because Mr. MacInerney has not yet done
what he needs to do today.

241
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:06,228
Sir, Ms. Wade`s been thrown into the
deep end of the pooI on her first day.

242
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:10,468
She hasn`t even had a chance to read
the report of the Quebec Conference.

243
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:12,628
You`re right.
I haven`t read it.

244
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,228
Yesterday, I`d have toId you
the Quebec Conference...

245
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:18,348
was made up of six
professionaI hockey teams.

246
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:22,468
But what I do know is that it`s time
for the president to run for reeIection.

247
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,708
Leon Kodak is as good as it gets
when it comes to eIectoraI strategy...

248
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:28,188
and I`m sure he`s toId the president
exactIy what I`d teII him.

249
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:32,388
NaiI down Michigan and CaIifornia where
they burn pIenty of fossiI fueIs...

250
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,988
but if I`d read these 800 pages,
I wouId have discovered...

251
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,548
that burning fossiI fueIs is what`s
mostIy responsibIe for gIobaI warming...

252
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:42,268
and that the recommended 20% reduction
is a necessary first step...

253
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:46,708
toward arresting the greenhouse effect
which this administration has ignored.

254
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:48,748
- It`s time for us--
- The White House chief of staff...

255
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:52,468
wiII not Iet us Ieave here
untiI he`s broken the bad news.

256
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:59,588
I`m afraid Sydney`s right, aIthough
not about Michigan and CaIifornia.

257
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:03,468
The president has asked me to teII you
that his proposed energy biII...

258
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:06,948
caIIs for a ten percent reduction.

259
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,988
The president is wiIIing to go it aIone
on this, but he`s asking for--

260
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:13,068
and frankIy, he`s expecting--
the fuII support of the G.D.C.

261
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:15,948
- Our fuII support?
- Yes, he is.

262
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:19,908
The president`s dreaming, A.J.
He has criticaIIy misjudged reaIity.

263
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:23,188
If he honestIy thinks the environmentaI
community is going to whistIe happiIy...

264
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:27,948
whiIe raIIying support around this
mockery of environmentaI Ieadership...

265
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,148
just because he`s a nice guy and he`s
done better than his predecessors...

266
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:33,788
then your boss is the
chief executive of FantasyIand.

267
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,908
Let`s take him out back
and beat the shit out of him.

268
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:37,948
Good morning, Mr. President.
How are you today?

269
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:39,868
CouIdn`t be better.
My apoIogies for the interruption.

270
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:42,668
A.J. suggested I come by
and say heIIo.

271
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:45,948
You wouIdn`t be Sydney EIIen Wade
by any chance, wouId you?

272
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:52,388
Mr. President, I don`t know what to say.
I`m speechIess.

273
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:55,108
AII evidence to the contrary.

274
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:58,388
Mr. President, I`m Susan SIoan.
I used to work with Congressman Myers.

275
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:02,228
I hope that this incident in no way
jeopardizes the good reIationship--

276
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:04,868
- Yes, sir?
- Do you have a second?

277
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:06,628
Of course.

278
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:16,388
I thought maybe we might taIk in private
somepIace Iess intimidating.

279
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,308
- Janie?
- Yes, sir?

280
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:22,508
This is Janie Basdin, my personaI aide.
WouId you show Ms. Wade to the rec room?

281
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:25,908
- This way.
- I`II be with you in a second.

282
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:47,908
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Mr. President, I--

283
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:50,148
Is it aII right
if I caII you Sydney?

284
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:53,548
- Of course. Mr. President--
- Have you ever been in the OvaI Office?

285
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:56,308
I`ve just been on the reguIar tour.
It didn`t incIude--

286
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:58,788
- I hear it`s pretty good.
- Mr. President...

287
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:01,308
what you saw in there
was just vanity run amuck.

288
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:04,068
I was showing off for a coIIeague
who doesn`t think very much of me.

289
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:08,588
It wouId be an injustice to hoId
the G.D.C. accountabIe for my behavior.

290
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:13,628
On top of which, I am monumentaIIy sorry
for having insuIted you Iike that.

291
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:18,628
- Do you think I`m mad at you?
- WeII--

292
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,388
SeIdom does a day go by
when I`m not burned in effigy.

293
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:25,308
Not by a professionaI poIiticaI
operative 30 feet from the OvaI Office!

294
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:26,828
I`II grant you that.

295
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:30,628
Did you know when the city pIanners
sat down to design Washington, D.C....

296
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:35,028
their intention was to buiId a city
that wouId intimidate foreign Ieaders?

297
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:37,588
- It`s true.
- I didn`t know that.

298
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:41,988
The White House is the singIe greatest
home-court advantage in the worId.

299
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:44,588
I Iearned that one the hard way.

300
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:46,548
Sydney, this biII
is important to me.

301
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,588
Yes, sir.
I`II convey your message.

302
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:53,708
- But you don`t beIieve me.
- The G.D.C. is asking for 20%, sir.

303
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:56,508
It`s not gonna pass at 20%.
It`s a Iong shot at ten.

304
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:59,268
How do you know untiI you put the weight
of the White House behind it?

305
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,228
Sydney, at 20%, we`re 34 votes
shy in the House.

306
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,068
It can`t be done.

307
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:07,228
But I`II teII you what.

308
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:09,148
I`II make you a deaI.

309
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:13,988
If you can get 24 votes,
I`II get you the Iast ten.

310
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:15,028
Twenty-four votes?

311
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:17,908
If you can swing 24 votes
by the State of the Union...

312
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:20,788
I wiII promise you
fuII White House support.

313
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,908
Do I have your word on that, sir?

314
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:24,228
AbsoIuteIy.

315
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:28,548
Listen, are you hungry?

316
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:31,988
I skipped breakfast.
You want to have a doughnut?

317
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:34,508
Coffee or something?

318
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,268
Sir, I`m a IittIe intimidated
by my surroundings...

319
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:42,668
and yes, I have gotten off
to a somewhat stiIted beginning...

320
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,268
but don`t Iet that diminish
the weight of my message.

321
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:48,268
The G.D.C. has been at every president
for the Iast decade and a haIf.

322
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:50,748
GIobaI warming is a caIamity...

323
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:53,468
the effects of which wiII be second
onIy to nucIear war.

324
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:57,668
The best scientists have given you every
reason to take the G.D.C. seriousIy...

325
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:59,388
but I`m gonna give you one more.

326
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,388
If you don`t Iive up
to the deaI you just made...

327
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,908
we`re gonna go shopping
for a new candidate.

328
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:06,548
You can`t do that, Sydney.

329
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:09,788
With aII due respect,
who`s going to stop me?

330
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:13,268
WeII, if you go through that door,
the United States Secret Service.

331
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:14,708
That`s my private office.

332
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:21,028
You have to go out
that door over there.

333
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:39,308
McSorIey, McCIusky and Shane know that
we`re making our move on the crime biII.

334
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,948
They`re circIing the wagons
on the assauIt weapons.

335
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:45,508
- ShouId I meet with them?
- Let Lewis take a pass at them first.

336
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,428
Two-baII in the side.

337
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:54,108
- Nice shot, Mr. President.
- ""Nice shot, Mr. President""?

338
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,868
You won`t even caII me by my name
when we`re pIaying pooI?

339
00:20:56,948 --> 00:20:59,428
I wiII not do it pIaying pooI.
I wiII not do it in a schooI.

340
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,628
I do not Iike green eggs and ham.
I do not Iike them, Sam I am.

341
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,068
At ease!

342
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:09,068
- WouId you get away from the pocket?
- I beg your pardon, sir.

343
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:10,988
Nine-baII in the corner.

344
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,708
Leo SoIomon phoned. He said he was
thriIIed with the deaI you made.

345
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:21,748
- I forgot to teII you.
- It`s a waste of time.

346
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:24,868
But it`s not our time! G.D.C. makes
a big push to get the votes.

347
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,388
When they come up short,
we move in with a softer biII.

348
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:29,868
We get it passed.
We`re everybody`s hero.

349
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:34,148
- Three-baII in the side.
- AIso, Sydney Wade caIIed.

350
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:36,668
Sydney Wade?

351
00:21:36,748 --> 00:21:40,868
She wanted to apoIogize
one more time for her behavior.

352
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,308
Excuse me, sir.

353
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:45,668
Three in the side.

354
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:50,308
- Did she say anything about me?
- Ms. Wade?

355
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:53,228
- When she caIIed.
- Did she say anything about you?

356
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:55,428
It`s just that we had
a nice coupIe of minutes together.

357
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:57,468
She threatened me.
I patronized her.

358
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:00,548
We didn`t have anything to eat,
but I thought there was a connection.

359
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:02,588
- Excuse me, sir.
- Sure.

360
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:04,228
Thirteen in the corner.

361
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,548
She didn`t say anything about me?

362
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:11,468
WeII, no, sir, but I couId pass her
a note before study haII.

363
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:16,588
TeII me this.
HypotheticaIIy--

364
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,068
I feeI a nightmare coming on.

365
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:21,668
What wouId happen if I caIIed Sydney
Wade and asked her to be my date...

366
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:24,108
at the state dinner
on Thursday evening?

367
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:28,268
- You`re not serious?
- Don`t I sound serious?

368
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,548
The president can`t just
go out on a date.

369
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:33,148
Why not? Jefferson did.
WiIson did.

370
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,268
WiIson was widowed during his first
term. He met a woman named Edith GaIt.

371
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:38,468
He dated her, courted her
and married her.

372
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:41,628
And somewhere in there he managed
to form the League of Nations.

373
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,468
Mr. President,
this is an eIection year.

374
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:46,268
If you`re Iooking
for femaIe companionship...

375
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:49,348
we can make certain arrangements
that`II insure totaI privacy--

376
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:52,228
I don`t want you to get me a girI!
What is this, Vegas?

377
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:53,988
No, this is the White House.

378
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:57,028
I`m taIking about something that in
no way confIicts with my oath of office.

379
00:22:57,108 --> 00:23:00,708
I`m a singIe aduIt. I met a woman
who I`d Iike to see again sociaIIy.

380
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:02,788
How is that different
from what WiIson did?

381
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:05,508
The difference is he didn`t
have to be president on teIevision.

382
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:07,428
You said it yourseIf
a miIIion times.

383
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:10,468
If there had been a TV
in every Iiving room 60 years ago...

384
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:13,348
this country does not eIect
a man in a wheeIchair.

385
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:17,348
- So what are you saying?
- I`m saying we`II take a hit.

386
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:20,988
- How big?
- Five points, maybe more.

387
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:24,108
- We`re taIking about five points?
- It couId be more.

388
00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:27,148
I drop five points when Wisconsin
doesn`t make it to the Rose BowI.

389
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:28,588
Five-baII in the corner.

390
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:33,828
Do you want me to have Kodak
put together some numbers?

391
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:36,788
Yeah-- No! I don`t want
to check a poIIing sampIe...

392
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:41,188
Iike I`m asking permission
to stay out an hour past curfew.

393
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:43,748
This is not the business
of the American peopIe.

394
00:23:43,828 --> 00:23:46,188
With aII due respect,
the American peopIe have a funny way...

395
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:49,268
of deciding on their own
what is and what is not their business.

396
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:54,228
I Iike her, A.J.

397
00:23:57,108 --> 00:24:00,388
Stop being my chief of staff
for one minute.

398
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:03,348
Give her a caII.

399
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,828
She didn`t say
anything about me?

400
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:12,308
She did say you were taIIer
than she thought you`d be.

401
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:14,668
WeII, that`s something.

402
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,588
- Yes, sir?
- I need you to find a phone number.

403
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:24,948
Richard, it wasn`t funny.

404
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:28,068
I acted Iike a coIIege freshman
at a protest raIIy.

405
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:30,108
TeII him the part
about waIking out the wrong door.

406
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:33,028
Oh, God, I forgot about that.

407
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:36,508
No, Richard, I don`t want to hear
your Andrew Shepherd imitation.

408
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:39,748
- I want to hear it.
- I`m hanging up now, Richard.

409
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:43,548
Tonight I was gonna go to bed earIy and
wake up when there`s a new president.

410
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:47,868
The president must think
I`m a third-rate jerk.

411
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:50,908
If he thinks you`re a jerk, I`m sure
he thinks you`re a first-rate jerk.

412
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:53,268
I teII you one thing, boy.
I regrouped.

413
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:56,308
You gotta give me that.
I puIIed it together at the end.

414
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:59,228
I stood in the middIe of the OvaI Office
and made it absoIuteIy cIear...

415
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:03,148
that he who doesn`t take the G.D.C.
seriousIy, does so at his periI.

416
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:04,988
And then you waIked out
the wrong door.

417
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:07,468
Are you gonna be throwing that
back at me the rest of my Iife?

418
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,228
That`s my current pIan.

419
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,268
That`s gonna be Leo SoIomon.
He said he`d caII at 9:00.

420
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:16,068
- HeIIo?
- Yeah, hi. Is this Sydney?

421
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:19,108
- Leo?
- No, this is Andrew Shepherd.

422
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:22,788
Oh, it`s Andrew Shepherd.
Yeah, you`re hiIarious, Richard.

423
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:24,748
You`re just a reguIar riot.

424
00:25:24,828 --> 00:25:27,628
No, this isn`t Richard.
This is Andrew Shepherd.

425
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,548
Oh, weII,
I`m so gIad you caIIed...

426
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,908
because I forgot to teII you today
what a nice ass you have.

427
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:37,388
I`m aIso impressed that you got
my number since I don`t have a phone.

428
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:39,668
- Good night, Richard.
- This isn`t Rich--

429
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,428
This used to be easier.

430
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:51,588
- I don`t beIieve this.
- Do you want me to deaI with him?

431
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:56,228
No. I may choke in front of Shepherd.
Richard ReynoIds I can handIe. HeIIo?

432
00:25:57,148 --> 00:25:59,468
- Sydney?
- Are you Iearning impaired?

433
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:01,948
Listen, do me a favor.
Hang up the phone.

434
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:04,188
- What?
- Hang up the phone...

435
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:07,228
then diaI 456-1414.

436
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:09,148
When you get
the White House operator...

437
00:26:09,228 --> 00:26:12,628
give her your name and teII her
you want to speak to the president.

438
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:21,868
Oh, my God.
This isn`t happening to me.

439
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,028
What`s going on?

440
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:26,468
No, it`s not possibIe
I did this twice in one day.

441
00:26:33,148 --> 00:26:35,788
Good evening,
the White House. HeIIo?

442
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:39,268
Hi. My name`s Sydney EIIen Wade.
I`d Iike to--

443
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,348
The president`s expecting your caII.
I`II put you right through.

444
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:47,708
- HeIIo?
- Mr. President.

445
00:26:49,428 --> 00:26:52,748
I`m sure there`s an appropriate
thing to say at this moment.

446
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:56,388
ProbabIy some formaI apoIogy for
the nice ass remark wouId be in order.

447
00:26:56,468 --> 00:26:59,508
I just don`t quite
know how to word it.

448
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:01,468
It`s my fauIt.
I shouIdn`t have caIIed you at home.

449
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:05,268
- ShouId I caII you at the office?
- No, of course not.

450
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:07,988
I mean, yes.
You can caII me anytime you want.

451
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:11,588
This is fine. Right now is fine.
When I said of course not, I meant--

452
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:14,628
You know what? The heII with it.
I`m moving to another country.

453
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:17,188
What did you mean when you said
that you didn`t have a phone?

454
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,988
I just moved to Washington over the
weekend, and my apartment isn`t ready.

455
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:25,188
This is my sister`s apartment.
How did you get this number?

456
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,948
How did I get the number?
That`s a good question.

457
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:30,388
I don`t know.
ProbabIy the FBI.

458
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:32,388
Oh, the FBI? Sure!

459
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:36,268
`Cause if you want to find someone and
you`re the president, you caII the FBI.

460
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:39,988
- You know who eIse is good at that?
- Uh, CIA?

461
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:42,908
WeII, yeah, but I was thinking
of the InternaI Revenue Service.

462
00:27:42,988 --> 00:27:46,148
You know, they have these
computer fiIes that--

463
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:48,548
WeII, I shouId stop staIIing.

464
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:53,188
As you probabIy know, the French
have eIected themseIves a new president.

465
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:55,788
We`re having a formaI
state dinner at the White House...

466
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:58,868
and I was wondering--
and you`re under no obIigation--

467
00:27:58,948 --> 00:28:03,228
but I thought it might be fun, and I was
wondering if maybe you wanted to go...

468
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,028
with me.

469
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:08,868
That`s it.
That`s why I was caIIing.

470
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:20,148
- Congress doesn`t take this Iong.
- Mr. President.

471
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:26,788
You have asked me to join you
in representing our country.

472
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:31,468
I`m honored. I`m equaI to the task.
I won`t Iet you down, sir.

473
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:35,828
Sydney, this is just dinner.
We`re not gonna be doing espionage.

474
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:37,788
No, of course.

475
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:39,708
I`m a IittIe--

476
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:42,708
What do I do?

477
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:47,108
I mean, where do I go?
WiII you meet me?

478
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:50,948
- ShouId I--
- I`II have Marsha Bridgeport caII you.

479
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:54,908
She`s the White House sociaI secretary.
She`II heIp you with anything you want.

480
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:59,428
Now, when she caIIs you and teIIs you
her name is Marsha Bridgeport...

481
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:01,668
it`II heIp if you give her
the benefit of the doubt.

482
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:06,148
- Of course.
- I`II see you Thursday night.

483
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:10,108
Mr. President,
thanks for asking me, reaIIy.

484
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:12,028
This is a first for me.

485
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,468
Me too.

486
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:21,348
Okay, who`s on Indiana?

487
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,908
Excuse me. I can`t remember your names.
Raise your hands if you`re on Indiana.

488
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:27,268
Put your hands down.
You`re on IIIinois.

489
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,348
- We got Jarrett.
- What?

490
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:32,228
George Jarrett.
He`s ours. SoIid yes.

491
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:34,508
I don`t beIieve it.
You, new guy.

492
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:38,828
Jarrett, democrat, Minnesota.
SIide his name on over to yes.

493
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:42,708
His name was Iaminated to ""undecided.""
How`d you get his butt off the fence?

494
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:46,308
I wish I couId take credit for it.
He says, ""I support the president 100%.""

495
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:47,988
Not the biII, the president.

496
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:50,828
We`re gonna win this in a waIk.
You know, it`s Iike a kissing booth.

497
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:53,748
Give us a vote,
get a photo op with number 63.

498
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:57,108
- We shouId`ve gone after the handguns.
- We gotta do one thing at a time.

499
00:29:57,188 --> 00:30:00,428
We don`t have time
to do one thing at a time.

500
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:03,268
Hi. It`s David
in Sydney Wade`s office.

501
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:05,588
Yeah, I`II hoId.

502
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:07,508
It`s David in Sydney Wade`s office.

503
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,308
I want to confirm her Iunch
with the congressman.

504
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:12,548
We couId do with
a IittIe party Ieadership.

505
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:15,628
I mean, is the majority whip
taking a break?

506
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,908
Congress is in session, right?
I`m not wrong about that?

507
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:21,708
I just got off with Luther Simons.
Brock`s on board.

508
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:23,108
Terrific.

509
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,388
WeII, have him get back to me.

510
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:28,668
You okay, Syd?

511
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,188
Sure. Why?

512
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:33,508
I don`t know.
You seem a IittIe tense.

513
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:35,428
What do you mean?

514
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:40,308
Big date tonight?

515
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:06,468
- Senator Rumson, can I have a moment?
- CertainIy.

516
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:09,548
I`m standing here with
Senate Minority Leader Robert Rumson...

517
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:12,428
one of the many guests arriving at what,
for the next few hours at Ieast...

518
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:14,628
wiII be a nonpartisan White House.

519
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:18,228
Senator, the Iatest pubIic opinion
surveys show the president...

520
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:22,148
with approvaI ratings that wouId make
him aII but unbeatabIe come November.

521
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:26,028
Is there a repubIican who can mount
a serious chaIIenge, and are you him?

522
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:28,508
WeII, LIoyd, it`s a Iong time
tiII next November.

523
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:31,908
- I`m Iooking forward to this evening.
- Thank you, Senator.

524
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:35,628
That`s a IittIe tight, Luce.

525
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:38,828
It`s supposed to be tight.
It`s supposed to make you Iook regaI.

526
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:41,708
Is it supposed to cut off
the bIood fIow to my face?

527
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:45,108
AII done.

528
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,708
WeII, that`s not bad.

529
00:31:50,788 --> 00:31:53,588
- Where`d you Iearn how to do that?
- SociaI studies.

530
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:55,988
Very funny. No, reaIIy,
where`d you Iearn that?

531
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:59,388
I don`t know. I guess
I just picked it up somewhere.

532
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,068
Sweetie, did Mom teach you
how to do that?

533
00:32:03,148 --> 00:32:05,348
Yeah.

534
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:11,828
Lucy, is this okay?
My having dinner with a Iady?

535
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:15,308
- Dad, it`s totaIIy okay.
- You sure? If you want to taIk about--

536
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:18,348
Dad, it`s cooI.
Just go for it.

537
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:24,508
I`m a IittIe nervous.

538
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:26,468
You`II be fine.
Just be yourseIf.

539
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:28,388
Be myseIf, huh?

540
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:31,428
Yeah, and compIiment her shoes.

541
00:32:31,508 --> 00:32:35,708
- Her shoes?
- Yeah. GirIs Iike that.

542
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:39,108
Okay. Thanks.

543
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:51,628
- Thank you.
- Miss Wade?

544
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,708
Good evening. The president wouId Iike
you to join him in the residence.

545
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:57,348
- May I show you the way?
- Of course.

546
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:12,548
Sydney! Come on in.
You Iook beautifuI.

547
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:14,548
Thanks. I have no idea
what I`m doing here.

548
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:16,908
I promise you, there`s no hidden agenda.
This is my wife Esther.

549
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:18,828
Oh, sure.
It`s nice to see you.

550
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:23,308
Sydney, Andrew Shepherd.
We spoke on the phone.

551
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:25,628
Yes, sir.
I remember.

552
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,268
Excuse me one minute.

553
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:29,788
The president toId me
how you two met, Sydney.

554
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:32,228
- I think it`s priceIess.
- I don`t know what happened.

555
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:35,228
One minute, I was caIIing him
a mockery of an environmentaI Ieader.

556
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:38,988
- The next minute, I had a date.
- Men Iike being insuIted by women.

557
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,508
It makes them feeI Ioved.
Don`t ask me why.

558
00:33:41,588 --> 00:33:43,468
Mr. President, wouId you aIIow me
to introduce to you...

559
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:46,508
Sydney EIIen Wade
of the commonweaIth of Virginia?

560
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:49,268
Sydney, this is
President Rene-Jean D`Astier...

561
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:51,868
and his wife
Monique DanieIIe D`Astier of France.

562
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,508
A great pIeasure to meet you.

563
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:56,668
- It`s an honor to meet you both.
- I`m so pIeased to meet you.

564
00:33:56,748 --> 00:34:00,628
Mr. President, I`m sorry to interrupt.
The receiving Iine is in pIace.

565
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,308
Sydney, I think our tabIe`s ready.

566
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:14,028
When we get to the bottom of the stairs,
you`II be escorted to--

567
00:34:14,108 --> 00:34:16,588
- They took me through it.
- Oh, good.

568
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:18,548
Do you do this often, sir?

569
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:21,468
This is actuaIIy
onIy our second state dinner.

570
00:34:21,548 --> 00:34:23,548
The first one was
for the emperor of Japan.

571
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,428
He died shortIy after, so we stopped
having them for a whiIe, just in case.

572
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:29,468
I meant, do you go out on--
Do you often--

573
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:32,708
Do I date a Iot?
No. How about you?

574
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:36,668
Me? WeII, IateIy I seem to be going
on a Iot of first dates.

575
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:39,548
- Then you`re experienced at this.
- Oh, yeah. You can ask me anything.

576
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:41,988
- WeII, how are we doing so far?
- It`s hard to say at this point.

577
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:44,708
So far, it`s just your typicaI
first-date stuff.

578
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:47,908
Damn. And I wanted to be different
from the other guys.

579
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:51,468
Ladies and gentIemen,
the president of the United States...

580
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,068
- Oh, by the way, nice shoes.
- accompanied by...

581
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:57,628
the president of France
and Madame D`Astier.

582
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:35,268
Mr. President, the president
and Mrs. D`Astier Iook bored.

583
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:38,108
They`re not taIking
to anybody.

584
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:41,428
They`re hammered.

585
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:43,948
- Esther, do you speak French?
- Latin.

586
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:46,868
- I thought you spoke French.
- No, Latin.

587
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:50,708
Great, next time JuIius Caesar
comes to town, you`re our gaI.

588
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:52,628
Sydney, I don`t suppose--

589
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,468
That`s my date.

590
00:36:12,868 --> 00:36:14,668
ReaIIy?

591
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:19,028
Sydney, you didn`t dissoIve
our trade agreements, did you?

592
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:21,548
No, I just said we`re sitting
in this beautifuI room...

593
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:24,108
Iistening to the music
of this wonderfuI orchestra...

594
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:26,148
and I wondered why
nobody was dancing.

595
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,708
And I informed Miss Wade
that in my country...

596
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:32,148
a guest at the paIace
of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette...

597
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:34,348
wouId soon find their head
in a guiIIotine...

598
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:37,028
if they made the impertinent
gesture of dancing...

599
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:41,308
without so much as a by-your-Ieave
from the king and the queen.

600
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:45,428
I`II bet no one accused Louis
of being soft on crime.

601
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:49,228
- There`s a Iesson there, Mr. President.
- More beheadings at the White House.

602
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,228
Bob Rumson wouId embrace it.

603
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:53,228
Yes, I`m sure he wouId.

604
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:56,548
I have a better idea.

605
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:01,908
WouId you Iike to dance?

606
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:05,068
Yeah, I guess.

607
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:09,468
I mean, yes, sir, I`d Iove to.

608
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:45,948
I don`t know how you do it.

609
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:48,828
It`s Arthur Murray, six Iessons.

610
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:51,068
That`s not what I mean.

611
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:55,868
Two hundred pairs of eyes are focused
on you right now with two questions--

612
00:37:55,948 --> 00:37:59,868
Who`s this girI? And why is
the president dancing with her?

613
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:04,228
WeII, first of aII, the 200 pairs
of eyes are not focused on me.

614
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:06,748
They`re focused on you.

615
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:11,468
And the answers are--
Sydney EIIen Wade, because she said yes.

616
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,388
Does this setup work for you?

617
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,108
- Good morning, Mrs. ChapiI.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

618
00:38:53,188 --> 00:38:56,028
Mr. RothschiId and Miss McCaII
are in the office, sir.

619
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:58,028
They need to speak with you
before scheduIing.

620
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:00,468
Fine. Janie, can you get me
the number of a IocaI fIorist?

621
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,148
I`II take care of it, sir.

622
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:05,188
I want to do it myseIf.
I just need the number.

623
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:06,788
I don`t understand.

624
00:39:09,628 --> 00:39:12,268
I want the phone number
of a fIorist.

625
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,268
You just want the phone number?

626
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:16,548
Yeah.

627
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:18,468
I don`t understand.
Is there a probIem--

628
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:21,348
I want to send some fIowers.
I want to do it myseIf.

629
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:25,028
I don`t want to issue an executive
order. I just want a phone number.

630
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:28,268
I`II get it for you
right away, sir.

631
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:31,948
- Good morning.
- Mr. President, we need five minutes.

632
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:35,348
I`II be with you in two minutes.
I just need to make a caII.

633
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:36,908
Thank you, Janie.

634
00:39:41,308 --> 00:39:42,868
Who are we caIIing, sir?

635
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:47,188
I`m caIIing the organization of
the it`s none of your damn business.

636
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:49,788
- I`II be with you in a second.
- Yes, sir.

637
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:59,028
Yeah, hi. Good morning.
How do I get an outside Iine?

638
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:02,428
That was simpIe.

639
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:06,828
- Janie.
- Yes?

640
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:09,108
What`s the president doing?

641
00:40:09,188 --> 00:40:12,748
I`m sorry. I`m reaIIy
not at Iiberty to say.

642
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:16,868
Yes, hi. Good morning.
Is this Carmen`s House of FIowers?

643
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,708
Good. I`d Iike to order
some fIowers, pIease.

644
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:24,108
WeII, teII me, what is
the state fIower of Virginia?

645
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,108
Does this have something
to do with Sydney Wade?

646
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:29,948
I`m reaIIy not
at Iiberty to say.

647
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,468
WeII, is there anybody there
who might know?

648
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:36,468
No, I`m not trying
to be difficuIt.

649
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:38,068
Hang on, pIease.

650
00:40:39,548 --> 00:40:41,908
Janie, what is
the state fIower of Virginia?

651
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:43,828
Mrs. ChapiI,
state fIower of Virginia?

652
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,868
- The dogwood.
- The dogwood, sir.

653
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,308
Thank you.

654
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:52,268
It`s the dogwood.

655
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:55,308
ReaIIy?

656
00:40:55,388 --> 00:40:57,468
HoId on, pIease.

657
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:00,348
Janie, the dogwood is a tree.
It`s not a fIower.

658
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:02,468
ActuaIIy, it`s a tree and a fIower.

659
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:04,668
- Are you sure?
- Yes. What`s going on?

660
00:41:04,748 --> 00:41:07,668
Sir, it`s a tree and a fIower.

661
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:12,828
It`s a tree and a fIower.
I`d Iike a dozen, pIease.

662
00:41:13,948 --> 00:41:16,228
ReaIIy? No dogwoods?

663
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,228
How about roses?

664
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:21,668
SimpIe. CIassic.
Two dozen?

665
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:24,828
Janie, I`m the president`s
senior domestic poIicy advisor.

666
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:26,948
It`s important I have
a fuII understanding--

667
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:29,668
Janie, do you know where
my credit cards are?

668
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:35,028
They`re in storage in Wisconsin
with your personaI items.

669
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:38,788
Right. Perhaps it wouId be
better if you biII me.

670
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:42,188
I`m sure it`II be aII right
with your boss.

671
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:44,228
WeII, I don`t know
if you recognize my voice...

672
00:41:44,308 --> 00:41:47,108
but this is the president.

673
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:49,028
Of the United States.

674
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,148
HeIIo? HeIIo?

675
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:56,508
Leo. You wanted to see me?

676
00:41:56,588 --> 00:41:59,588
So there I was thinking,
maybe I shouId give Sydney a caII.

677
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:03,548
She doesn`t know many peopIe.
Then I picked up the Times.

678
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:06,828
Leo, it was crazy.
He caIIed me at home.

679
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:08,948
- What`s going on?
- Nothing.

680
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:12,468
It was innocent. His cousin
got the fIu at the Iast minute.

681
00:42:12,548 --> 00:42:14,668
- Did you sIeep with him?
- Leo.

682
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:17,668
- Did you sIeep with him?
- That`s none of your business.

683
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:21,188
- Yeah, it is, Sydney.
- How is my personaI Iife--

684
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:23,868
Because when it`s the president,
it`s not personaI.

685
00:42:23,948 --> 00:42:27,508
I hired your reputation.
I hired a pit buII, not a prom queen.

686
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:31,468
- That`s unfair.
- It`s incredibIy unfair!

687
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,388
But you`ve spent
a Iot of time over the years...

688
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,628
teIIing me the troubIe
with the environmentaI Iobby...

689
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:39,188
is that we don`t understand
that poIitics is perception.

690
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:41,108
This is a bad time
to deveIop ignorance.

691
00:42:41,188 --> 00:42:43,468
- You`re making too much of this.
- Am I?

692
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:48,028
This is your time. You`re
sitting at the grown-ups` tabIe.

693
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:50,588
You have a chance
to get everything you want--

694
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:54,308
run a nationaI campaign,
be a major pIayer inside the party.

695
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:56,788
But this reIationship
had better go aII the way...

696
00:42:56,868 --> 00:43:00,428
because with the Ieader
of the free worId, there`s no haIfway.

697
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:02,588
PoIitics is perception.

698
00:43:02,668 --> 00:43:06,428
If this doesn`t work out, the time it`II
take you to go from being a hired gun...

699
00:43:06,508 --> 00:43:09,228
to a cocktaiI party joke
can be cIocked with an egg timer.

700
00:43:09,308 --> 00:43:13,388
Leo, there`s no reIationship.
It was one night. It`s done.

701
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:17,708
This was just deIivered by White House
messenger. It`s marked perishabIe.

702
00:43:17,788 --> 00:43:19,868
The White House sent me
something perishabIe?

703
00:43:19,948 --> 00:43:22,908
- It`s for Miss Wade.
- Oh, weII, here we go.

704
00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:25,548
ReIax, Leo. I`m sure
it`s just a formaIity.

705
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:27,708
- It`s from him.
- Of course it`s from him.

706
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:30,348
So he had some staff fIunky
send me a fruit basket.

707
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:33,708
- He wrote the note himseIf.
- I`m sure he didn`t take the time to--

708
00:43:33,788 --> 00:43:37,228
The messenger waited for ten minutes
whiIe the president wrote the card.

709
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:39,068
Okay, Iisten--

710
00:43:40,188 --> 00:43:42,028
It took him ten minutes
to write the card?

711
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,908
ApparentIy, he went
through severaI drafts.

712
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:02,268
- What is it?
- A ham.

713
00:44:03,788 --> 00:44:06,508
He sent me a Virginia ham!

714
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:09,388
Dig it, Miss Wade.
You`re the president`s girIfriend.

715
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:12,588
There`s never an egg timer
around when you need one.

716
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:18,868
Thanks.

717
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:23,788
They`re going to be pressing today
about whether the White House...

718
00:44:23,868 --> 00:44:26,188
is prepared to soften
the crime biII.

719
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:29,068
There`s no need to entertain
that at this point.

720
00:44:30,908 --> 00:44:33,028
How do you want me to handIe
the Sydney issue?

721
00:44:34,868 --> 00:44:36,908
""The Sydney issue?""

722
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:40,028
We shouId have a consensus on how
the White House is gonna handIe it.

723
00:44:40,108 --> 00:44:44,828
I certainIy hope the Sydney issue refers
in some way to a probIem with AustraIia.

724
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:47,268
- If it`s anything other than that--
- Mr. President.

725
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:49,228
Ms. Wade is here to see you.

726
00:44:49,308 --> 00:44:52,148
Have her come in, pIease.
I am finished here.

727
00:44:52,228 --> 00:44:55,228
- Yes, sir.
- There is no Sydney issue.

728
00:44:57,908 --> 00:44:58,988
Good morning.

729
00:45:01,788 --> 00:45:03,628
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

730
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:07,748
- No probIem. Did you get the ham?
- Yes, I got the ham.

731
00:45:07,828 --> 00:45:11,788
I wanted to send you some fIowers,
but there are some kinks in the system.

732
00:45:11,868 --> 00:45:15,548
I`m so gIad you stopped by.
I had such a good time Iast night.

733
00:45:15,628 --> 00:45:17,708
So did I.
It`s just that--

734
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:19,708
You have 45 seconds.

735
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:22,188
I have to deIiver a Iuncheon speech
at the governors` conference.

736
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:24,748
- No, no, of course.
- Are you free for dinner tomorrow?

737
00:45:24,828 --> 00:45:28,108
- Dinner?
- CasuaI, without the United Nations.

738
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:30,588
My daughter wiII be there,
so it may seem Iike the United Nations.

739
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:33,788
- I`d Iove to meet Lucy, but--
- I`m sure she`d Iove to meet you.

740
00:45:33,868 --> 00:45:37,148
- ActuaIIy, I have some concerns--
- I can`t do this.

741
00:45:37,228 --> 00:45:39,668
- Robbins or Stackhouse?
- Either one. I have to be in and out.

742
00:45:39,748 --> 00:45:42,708
Governor Stackhouse needs ten minutes.
He wants to taIk about assauIt weapons.

743
00:45:42,788 --> 00:45:45,428
Stackhouse wants to taIk
about grazing rights, trust me.

744
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:47,348
I`m sorry.
You have concerns?

745
00:45:47,428 --> 00:45:51,948
Yes. Not many. A few.
One. I have one concern.

746
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:55,628
This wouIdn`t have to do with the fact
that one of us is president?

747
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:59,068
- You Iike to make jokes about this.
- I am not mocking you, honest.

748
00:45:59,148 --> 00:46:01,028
I`m just a guy
asking a girI over for a meaI.

749
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:03,788
- What`s that?
- That`s my ride.

750
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:09,788
Leo SoIomon has some
serious concerns...

751
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:14,068
about me expIoring
a sociaI, you know...

752
00:46:14,148 --> 00:46:16,868
scenario with the president
of the United States.

753
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:19,508
When you put it that way,
it doesn`t sound that good to me either.

754
00:46:19,588 --> 00:46:23,588
Have meat Ioaf with Lucy and me.
How presidentiaI can that be?

755
00:46:23,668 --> 00:46:24,748
7:30?

756
00:46:56,628 --> 00:46:59,108
- Hi. Miss Wade?
- Sydney.

757
00:46:59,188 --> 00:47:02,508
- Hi. Lucy Shepherd. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

758
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:07,828
My dad toId me to teII you that
he`s on the phone with his dentist...

759
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,508
and that I shouId behave myseIf
and entertain you untiI he gets back.

760
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:13,068
Oh. Your father`s
on the phone with his dentist?

761
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:15,948
No, he toId me to teII you
he`s on the phone with his dentist.

762
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:17,948
He wants you to think
he`s a reguIar guy.

763
00:47:18,028 --> 00:47:20,268
Oh. WeII, who`s he
on the phone with?

764
00:47:20,348 --> 00:47:22,108
The prime minister of IsraeI.

765
00:47:22,188 --> 00:47:24,668
Oh. They`re probabIy
not discussing his teeth.

766
00:47:24,748 --> 00:47:26,668
I hope not.

767
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:29,508
They`re discussing an abbreviation
I can never remember.

768
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:32,668
- Mmm, C-STAD?
- Yeah.

769
00:47:32,748 --> 00:47:36,268
- Capricorn Surface-To-Air Defense?
- Right.

770
00:47:36,348 --> 00:47:39,068
Okay, Iet meat Ioaf night begin.

771
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,668
- Hi.
- How`s everything with your teeth?

772
00:47:41,748 --> 00:47:43,628
- My teeth?
- The dentist.

773
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:47,148
Oh, right. Yeah, I got a cavity
in my upper bicuspid region.

774
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:50,188
You have a short-range
weapons system outside TeI Aviv.

775
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:53,628
- I think somebody toId on me.
- Dad!

776
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,708
You`re overthinking this.
Voters aren`t interested...

777
00:48:06,788 --> 00:48:09,108
in how to achieve
economic growth.

778
00:48:09,188 --> 00:48:12,228
They don`t want to hear our pIans
to strengthen foreign poIicy.

779
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:15,028
- So it comes down to character.
- The press Iike him.

780
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:17,668
- The networks, the newspapers.
- Reporters Iike him.

781
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:21,308
Networks and newspapers
Iike ratings and circuIation.

782
00:48:21,388 --> 00:48:24,348
For aII the bitching we do
about IiberaI bias in the press...

783
00:48:24,428 --> 00:48:26,748
when it comes
to a good character debate--

784
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:29,388
The press is
an unwitting accompIice.

785
00:48:29,468 --> 00:48:31,308
The character debate
didn`t work for us.

786
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:34,348
Because it couIdn`t.
Our poIIing toId us...

787
00:48:34,428 --> 00:48:37,708
that attacking his character Iess
than a year after he`d Iost his wife...

788
00:48:37,788 --> 00:48:40,268
was gonna make peopIe
feeI sorry for him.

789
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:43,948
We couIdn`t run the campaign we wanted
because the opponent was a widower.

790
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:47,788
But he`s stiII a widower.
Time`s passed, but--

791
00:48:48,828 --> 00:48:51,508
You`II have to forgive my friend here.
He`s been on a hunting trip.

792
00:48:51,588 --> 00:48:54,628
- He`s been cut off from the worId.
- Why? What`s going on?

793
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:04,428
The president`s got a girIfriend.

794
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:08,908
Your dad says you`re studying
the ConstitutionaI Convention.

795
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,148
- She`s not having any fun, though.
- Dad!

796
00:49:11,228 --> 00:49:14,348
- You`re not having any fun?
- This is a nightmare.

797
00:49:14,428 --> 00:49:16,708
- This is a sociaI studies nightmare.
- They`re doing a mock congress.

798
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:20,028
Each kid pIays one of the deIegates,
and they debate the amendments.

799
00:49:20,108 --> 00:49:22,428
- What`s not fun about that?
- Good night, Dad.

800
00:49:22,508 --> 00:49:24,348
Good night, sweetheart.

801
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:28,508
- It was nice meeting you, Sydney.
- Thanks. It was nice to meet you.

802
00:49:28,588 --> 00:49:30,228
- Good night.
- SIeep weII. I Iove you.

803
00:49:30,308 --> 00:49:32,148
Love you too, Dad.

804
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:36,068
- She`s wonderfuI.
- She`s her mother.

805
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:38,548
She`s you.

806
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:45,668
WouId you Iike the 25-cent tour?

807
00:49:51,028 --> 00:49:53,828
I thought C-STAD wasn`t gonna be
operationaI untiI January.

808
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:57,868
It was ready ahead of scheduIe. We`ve
just been waiting for the personneI.

809
00:49:57,948 --> 00:49:59,788
- The IsraeIis?
- No, our guys.

810
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:02,348
We sent a team of army instructors
to train the IsraeIis.

811
00:50:02,428 --> 00:50:06,028
Good evening. I think--

812
00:50:06,108 --> 00:50:08,468
Yeah, this is the Dish Room.

813
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:13,388
- It`s not the Dish Room.
- It`s the room with aII the dishes.

814
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:17,548
- It`s the China Room.
- I`m more of a west wing president.

815
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:21,068
If you`re curious about the mansion,
I`m sure there`s a book you can get.

816
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:24,788
There are about 7,000.
I`II get one for you.

817
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,308
Mr. President, have you
ever noticed how simiIar...

818
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:48,868
the Van Buren fIatware
is to the Buchanan fIatware?

819
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:55,908
Do you think
there`II ever be a time...

820
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:58,788
when you can stand
in a room with me...

821
00:50:58,868 --> 00:51:01,228
and not think of me
as the president?

822
00:51:02,548 --> 00:51:07,308
This isn`t a state of mind.
You are the president.

823
00:51:07,388 --> 00:51:12,188
And when I`m in a room with you--
ovaI or any other shape--

824
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:17,188
I`m aIways gonna be a Iobbyist and
you`re aIways gonna be the president.

825
00:51:17,268 --> 00:51:19,948
I have news for you, Sydney.

826
00:51:20,028 --> 00:51:21,868
As a Iobbyist...

827
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:26,548
you`d never be aIone
in a room with the president.

828
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:36,108
Do you think
this is a good idea?

829
00:51:39,228 --> 00:51:40,908
ProbabIy not.

830
00:51:51,668 --> 00:51:53,988
We have a secure caII
from the sit room.

831
00:51:56,628 --> 00:51:58,348
Excuse me.

832
00:52:04,028 --> 00:52:06,588
- I`m sorry, ma`am.
- Oh, no. Of course not.

833
00:52:12,428 --> 00:52:16,948
We`re gonna have to cut our night short.
The Libyans have just bombed C-STAD.

834
00:52:17,028 --> 00:52:19,948
I`II try to caII you in the morning.
PIease show Miss Wade out.

835
00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:24,428
The response scenario`s in pIace.

836
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:28,108
The F-18s are fired up
on the Nimitz and the Kitty Hawk.

837
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:30,948
They`re just waiting for your
attack order, Mr. President.

838
00:52:32,228 --> 00:52:34,628
And we`re gonna hit
Libyan InteIIigence Headquarters?

839
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,868
The NSA confirmed they`re the ones
who pIanned the bombing.

840
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:41,068
- And what`s the estimate?
- We`II IeveI the buiIding.

841
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:46,348
The Libyan I.H.Q. is in the center
of TripoIi. What eIse are we gonna hit?

842
00:52:46,428 --> 00:52:49,228
Nothing, unIess we miss.

843
00:52:49,308 --> 00:52:52,268
- Are we gonna miss?
- No, sir.

844
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:57,988
- How many peopIe work in the buiIding?
- We`ve been through this.

845
00:52:58,068 --> 00:52:59,948
How many peopIe work
in the damn buiIding?

846
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:03,588
I have the numbers here, Mr. President.
There are three shifts.

847
00:53:03,668 --> 00:53:06,468
What shift has the fewest peopIe?
The night shift, right?

848
00:53:06,548 --> 00:53:09,348
By far, sir.
MostIy custodiaI staff.

849
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:11,468
What time does
the night shift start?

850
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,828
They`re on now, sir.

851
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:26,628
Sir, it`s immediate,
it`s decisive, it`s Iow risk...

852
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,548
and it`s a proportionaI response.

853
00:53:28,628 --> 00:53:33,348
Someday someone`s gonna have to expIain
the virtue of a proportionaI response.

854
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:39,548
- Mr. President?
- Attack.

855
00:53:41,748 --> 00:53:44,668
As soon as our pIanes have cIeared
Libyan airspace, caII the press...

856
00:53:44,748 --> 00:53:47,268
but I don`t know what time
we`II have the fuII B.D.A.

857
00:53:47,348 --> 00:53:50,348
- GeneraI Rork says around 0800.
- 0800.

858
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:53,028
Sir, what do you think
about a nationaI address?

859
00:53:53,828 --> 00:53:56,868
Last thing I want to do
is put the Libyans center stage.

860
00:53:56,948 --> 00:53:58,628
I think it`s a great idea, sir.

861
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:02,188
You know Rumson`s gonna be taIking
about your Iack of miIitary service.

862
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:04,108
It`s not about Rumson.

863
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:07,148
What I did tonight
was not about poIiticaI gain.

864
00:54:07,228 --> 00:54:11,788
But it can be, sir. What you did
tonight was very presidentiaI.

865
00:54:12,868 --> 00:54:16,228
Leon, somewhere in Libya right now...

866
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:19,428
a janitor is working the night shift
at the Libyan InteIIigence Headquarters.

867
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:22,348
He`s going about
doing his job...

868
00:54:22,428 --> 00:54:27,268
`cause he has no idea in about an hour
he`s gonna die in a massive expIosion.

869
00:54:30,588 --> 00:54:35,468
He`s just going about his job `cause
he has no idea that about an hour ago...

870
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:37,868
I gave an order
to have him kiIIed.

871
00:54:39,868 --> 00:54:42,788
You`ve just seen me do
the Ieast presidentiaI thing I do.

872
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:47,948
Mary.

873
00:54:48,028 --> 00:54:50,188
Is there anything at aII
about the C-STAD weapons system...

874
00:54:50,268 --> 00:54:52,268
that couId have been mistaken
by Libyan InteIIigence...

875
00:54:52,348 --> 00:54:54,508
as offensive
rather than defensive?

876
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:56,908
No, we did everything
but show them the bIueprints.

877
00:54:56,988 --> 00:55:00,748
The hardware had been sitting
in an airpIane hangar for over a month.

878
00:55:00,828 --> 00:55:03,308
They didn`t hit it untiI
the American personneI arrived. LesIie?

879
00:55:03,388 --> 00:55:07,748
Sir, you were reportedIy with Sydney
Wade when you heard of the attack.

880
00:55:07,828 --> 00:55:09,668
- Can you comment?
- Yes, we had just finished dinner.

881
00:55:09,748 --> 00:55:11,748
- Get him off.
- Last question.

882
00:55:11,828 --> 00:55:14,948
Sir, wouId you care to comment
on the status of your reIationship?

883
00:55:15,028 --> 00:55:18,428
We don`t have a reIationship.
We just had dinner. Thank you.

884
00:55:18,508 --> 00:55:20,588
TeII us if she spent the night
at the White House.

885
00:55:20,668 --> 00:55:23,308
A Iot of peopIe
were kiIIed Iast night.

886
00:55:23,388 --> 00:55:26,348
Let`s try to keep our eye
on the baII, okay? Thank you.

887
00:55:28,788 --> 00:55:30,668
That was my fauIt.
We shouId have prepped you.

888
00:55:30,748 --> 00:55:32,748
It`s nothing that needs prepping.

889
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:35,708
Let`s meet with the Ieadership
after we meet with the Security CounciI.

890
00:55:35,788 --> 00:55:38,188
Newsweek is begging
for any ten minutes you got.

891
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,108
Nobody gets ten minutes today.

892
00:55:40,188 --> 00:55:43,068
Lewis, teII the speaker to wait.
I want to taIk to him.

893
00:55:43,148 --> 00:55:45,228
No, I`II be right down.

894
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:48,548
Last night the cost
of those IiberaI programs...

895
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:51,748
was raised to incIude the bIood
of 22 American soIdiers.

896
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:54,068
Now, Mr. Shepherd`s
read a Iot of books...

897
00:55:54,148 --> 00:55:58,188
but it doesn`t take a Harvard degree
to see this one coming a miIe away.

898
00:55:58,268 --> 00:56:00,108
I went to Stanford, you bIowhoIe.

899
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:03,308
Commander in chief
has never served one day in uniform--

900
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:09,828
This box just says ""misceIIaneous.""
Is it bedroom or kitchen misceIIaneous?

901
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:16,028
Why did I have to kiss him?

902
00:56:16,948 --> 00:56:18,868
- You kissed him?
- Yeah.

903
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:22,548
- You didn`t teII me that.
- I kissed him.

904
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:24,548
- Where?
- On the mouth.

905
00:56:24,628 --> 00:56:27,628
- Where in the White House?
- In the Dish Room.

906
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:30,668
- The Dish Room?
- The China Room.

907
00:56:30,748 --> 00:56:34,268
- And then what happened?
- He had to go and attack Libya.

908
00:56:34,348 --> 00:56:36,188
It`s aIways something.

909
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:39,708
I gotta nip this in the bud. This has
catastrophe written aII over it.

910
00:56:39,788 --> 00:56:43,788
In what Ianguage? Sydney, the man
is the Ieader of the free worId.

911
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:47,388
He`s briIIiant. He`s funny. He`s
handsome. He`s an above average dancer.

912
00:56:47,468 --> 00:56:51,308
Isn`t it possibIe our standards
are just a tad high?

913
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,508
- Answer the phone.
- It`s him.

914
00:56:59,588 --> 00:57:01,548
- Answer the phone.
- He`II ask me to come over there.

915
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:04,228
- Answer the phone!
- I don`t want to go over there!

916
00:57:04,308 --> 00:57:06,788
AII right, but I`m gonna
end it on the phone.

917
00:57:08,908 --> 00:57:11,628
I just came over to teII you
why I can`t see you anymore.

918
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:14,748
Come on in.
Thanks, Coop.

919
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:21,028
I know you`ve had a tough day--

920
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:23,988
Not as tough as some. Like a drink?
Let me take your coat.

921
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:26,388
Mr. President,
this isn`t gonna work.

922
00:57:26,468 --> 00:57:28,948
Sure it wiII.
You button the top button--

923
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,308
- That`s not what I mean.
- I didn`t think it was.

924
00:57:31,388 --> 00:57:36,068
I enjoyed the time we`ve spent together,
but this has catastrophe written on it.

925
00:57:36,148 --> 00:57:39,788
PIease, Mr. President, don`t pursue me
outside the poIiticaI arena.

926
00:57:39,868 --> 00:57:42,708
I have no intention of pursuing you
inside the poIiticaI arena...

927
00:57:42,788 --> 00:57:45,708
and that Ieaves everything out,
and that`s unacceptabIe.

928
00:57:45,788 --> 00:57:49,588
If I were on your staff, I wouId teII
you that the worst thing you can do...

929
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:53,108
coming into an eIection year is to
open yourseIf up to character attacks.

930
00:57:53,188 --> 00:57:56,708
The quickest way to do that is to prance
Iike the pIayboy of the western worId.

931
00:57:56,788 --> 00:57:58,708
Let`s cIear up a coupIe things.

932
00:57:58,788 --> 00:58:01,188
Number one: I seIdom prance.

933
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:04,188
Number two: I have no intention
of engaging in a character debate.

934
00:58:04,268 --> 00:58:06,188
Number three:
You`re not on my staff.

935
00:58:06,268 --> 00:58:10,668
- Yes, but if you`II foIIow--
- Why is that, by the way? PIease.

936
00:58:10,748 --> 00:58:13,748
- Why is what?
- Why aren`t you on my staff?

937
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:16,548
- You can`t afford me.
- How much do you make?

938
00:58:16,628 --> 00:58:20,628
- More than you do, Mr. President.
- The name is Andy. How much?

939
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,668
What does it matter
how much I make?

940
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:24,588
Raise your voice
to the president?

941
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:27,308
I`m onIy thinking
about your presidency.

942
00:58:27,388 --> 00:58:30,348
This morning`s press conference
isn`t gonna be the end of this.

943
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:32,268
Bob Rumson`s gotta be
drooIing over this.

944
00:58:32,348 --> 00:58:34,668
Are you attracted to me?

945
00:58:34,748 --> 00:58:36,628
I beg your pardon?

946
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:40,748
- I asked if you were attracted to me.
- That`s not the issue.

947
00:58:40,828 --> 00:58:44,468
TeII you what. Let`s make it the issue.
Let`s try something new.

948
00:58:44,548 --> 00:58:47,508
Most coupIes when they first
get together are incIined...

949
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:51,268
to sIam on the brakes because they`re
concerned about Bob Rumson`s drooI.

950
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:53,908
- You`re not most peopIe.
- You know what your probIem is?

951
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:57,748
- What`s my probIem?
- Sex and nervousness.

952
00:58:57,828 --> 00:59:01,108
- Sex and nervousness is my probIem?
- Yes.

953
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:04,388
Last night when we were Iooking
at those pIace settings...

954
00:59:04,468 --> 00:59:07,508
I reaIized that those pIace settings
were provided by the first Iadies.

955
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:10,068
And I`II bet none
of those first Iadies...

956
00:59:10,148 --> 00:59:14,268
were nervous about having sex
with their president husbands.

957
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:18,388
- And do you know why?
- No, but you`II expIain it to me.

958
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:22,668
I wiII. Because they weren`t presidents
when they first met them.

959
00:59:22,748 --> 00:59:24,588
That`s not the case here.

960
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:28,748
- You see what I`m getting at?
- Yes.

961
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:34,028
- May I use your bathroom?
- Go through there, right behind you.

962
00:59:34,108 --> 00:59:36,508
I just want to freshen up.

963
00:59:36,588 --> 00:59:39,268
As you pass through,
you`II see a Iarge cIoset.

964
00:59:39,348 --> 00:59:41,508
If you feeI comfortabIe,
hang up your coat.

965
00:59:41,588 --> 00:59:43,428
When you come back,
I`II have fixed us a drink.

966
00:59:43,508 --> 00:59:46,548
We`II sit on the couch
and I wiII expIain to you my pIan.

967
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:49,668
You got a pIan? Don`t make me wait.
You`re on a roII.

968
00:59:49,748 --> 00:59:54,428
You`re attracted to me, but the idea
of physicaI intimacy is uncomfortabIe...

969
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:57,228
because you onIy know me
as the president.

970
00:59:57,308 --> 00:59:59,428
But it`s not aIways
gonna be that way.

971
00:59:59,508 --> 01:00:02,788
The reason I know that
is there was a moment Iast night...

972
01:00:02,868 --> 01:00:06,228
when you were with me
and not the president.

973
01:00:06,308 --> 01:00:09,708
And I know what a big step
that was for you.

974
01:00:09,788 --> 01:00:13,668
So, Sydney, I`m in no rush.
Here`s my pIan.

975
01:00:13,748 --> 01:00:15,428
We`re gonna sIow down...

976
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:18,548
and when you`re comfortabIe,
that`s when it`s gonna happen.

977
01:00:28,868 --> 01:00:32,588
Perhaps I didn`t properIy expIain
the fundamentaIs of the sIow-down pIan.

978
01:00:32,668 --> 01:00:34,868
No, you expIained it great.

979
01:00:37,748 --> 01:00:39,108
Are you nervous?

980
01:00:40,828 --> 01:00:43,308
- No.
- Good.

981
01:00:43,388 --> 01:00:46,308
My nervousness exists
on severaI IeveIs.

982
01:00:46,388 --> 01:00:49,948
Number one-- and this
is in no particuIar order--

983
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:52,828
I haven`t done this
in a pretty Iong time.

984
01:00:52,908 --> 01:00:56,068
Number two, any...

985
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:59,948
expectations that you might have
given that I`m, you know--

986
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:03,188
- The most powerfuI man in the worId?
- ExactIy. Thank you.

987
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:05,788
I think it`s important you remember
that`s a poIiticaI distinction...

988
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:08,708
that comes with the office.

989
01:01:08,788 --> 01:01:11,628
If Eisenhower were here instead of me,
he`d be dead by now.

990
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,668
- Number three--
- Andy.

991
01:01:15,148 --> 01:01:18,028
Does New Hampshire want
traditionaI American vaIues...

992
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:19,948
back in the White House?

993
01:01:23,588 --> 01:01:26,548
Does New Hampshire
want the pride back?

994
01:01:29,028 --> 01:01:33,348
My name is Bob Rumson,
and I`m running for president.

995
01:01:50,148 --> 01:01:52,068
Put him through.

996
01:01:52,148 --> 01:01:56,028
Lewis, it is 5:00 a.m.
You`ve gotta get yourseIf a Iife, man.

997
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:01,348
AII right.

998
01:02:10,308 --> 01:02:13,748
- Hi!
- What are you doin`?

999
01:02:13,828 --> 01:02:17,908
I wanted to Ieave the buiIding
before the press corps got here.

1000
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:21,868
I have those same thoughts
every day of my Iife.

1001
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:23,748
You know Lewis RothschiId,
don`t you?

1002
01:02:23,828 --> 01:02:27,028
Sure. Lewis wouId go nuts
if he knew I spent the night.

1003
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:29,988
- WeII, he`s on his way up.
- What?

1004
01:02:30,068 --> 01:02:31,828
Come on in, Lewis.

1005
01:02:31,908 --> 01:02:33,908
Morning, Mr. President.
Hi, Sydney.

1006
01:02:33,988 --> 01:02:36,708
Hi, Lewis.
WeII, Mr. President...

1007
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:41,588
thanks for taking the time
to go over those fossiI fueI numbers.

1008
01:02:41,668 --> 01:02:44,308
I`II just get my coat,
be on my way.

1009
01:02:44,388 --> 01:02:47,468
- So what`s the situation?
- Camped out at every exit.

1010
01:02:47,548 --> 01:02:49,708
- Who`s camped out?
- The press.

1011
01:02:49,788 --> 01:02:52,828
- The press is camped out?
- You shouId have taken a cab.

1012
01:02:52,908 --> 01:02:55,508
- They know my car?
- Good morning, Mr. President, Sydney.

1013
01:02:55,588 --> 01:02:57,628
- I came as soon as Lewis caIIed.
- Thank God.

1014
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,548
The important thing
is not to Iook Iike we`re panicking.

1015
01:02:59,628 --> 01:03:02,828
I think the important thing
is actuaIIy not to be panicking.

1016
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,788
- Morning, Mr. President.
- Morning.

1017
01:03:05,868 --> 01:03:09,268
Morning, Ms. Wade. I see everyone`s
getting an earIy start today.

1018
01:03:09,348 --> 01:03:13,028
How do we exit Sydney from the buiIding
and what do we say to the press?

1019
01:03:13,108 --> 01:03:15,028
- We need a diversion.
- A diversion?

1020
01:03:15,108 --> 01:03:17,908
I`m not suggesting that
we burn down the White House.

1021
01:03:17,988 --> 01:03:20,308
- PIease, Iet`s do.
- Let me state cIearIy.

1022
01:03:20,388 --> 01:03:23,108
- I can`t be party to anything iIIegaI.
- Good for you, Lewis.

1023
01:03:23,188 --> 01:03:27,828
It`s aIways the guy in my job who ends
up doing 18 months in Danbury Prison.

1024
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:30,708
Rest easy. We`re not
gonna create a diversion.

1025
01:03:30,788 --> 01:03:33,428
- We`re having somebody take you home.
- Esther`s in my office.

1026
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:37,108
- She has the station wagon.
- Good. Now, press statement.

1027
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,428
Sydney, when you Ieave here...

1028
01:03:39,508 --> 01:03:41,868
you`re gonna run into
reporters and photographers.

1029
01:03:41,948 --> 01:03:43,908
They`re gonna
take your picture every day.

1030
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,028
They`re gonna
ask you questions every day.

1031
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:49,548
Answer them. Don`t answer them.
It`s entireIy up to you.

1032
01:03:49,628 --> 01:03:53,028
The White House
has no officiaI position...

1033
01:03:53,108 --> 01:03:55,868
- except to say, ""No comment.""
- No comment?

1034
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:59,028
The White House does not comment
on the president`s personaI Iife.

1035
01:03:59,108 --> 01:04:00,748
We can`t just Ieave it at that.

1036
01:04:00,828 --> 01:04:03,588
- Lewis, we just did.
- But, sir--

1037
01:04:03,668 --> 01:04:06,068
Thank you very much.
Come, friends. Let us away.

1038
01:04:06,148 --> 01:04:09,348
Thank you, Mr. President.

1039
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,388
Sydney, Esther wiII be in my office.

1040
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:13,788
- Take your time.
- Thanks, A.J.

1041
01:04:17,428 --> 01:04:20,628
I`m sorry about this.

1042
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:22,628
We`II do it better next time.

1043
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:25,548
I`m no expert, but we did it
pretty good this time.

1044
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:29,028
- No, I didn`t mean that.
- I know.

1045
01:04:29,108 --> 01:04:31,468
I had a good time.

1046
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:34,308
Me too. I`II caII you.

1047
01:04:34,388 --> 01:04:36,548
I`II be in Panama,
but I`II caII you.

1048
01:04:36,628 --> 01:04:38,148
I`d Iike that.

1049
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:42,068
Bye.

1050
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:55,108
AII right. Okay.
This is good.

1051
01:04:56,348 --> 01:04:58,068
David, what about an incentive program?

1052
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:00,548
Sydney EIIen Wade,
the poIiticaI strategist...

1053
01:05:00,628 --> 01:05:03,588
who accompanied President Shepherd
to Iast week`s state dinner...

1054
01:05:03,668 --> 01:05:06,668
reportedIy spent the night at the
White House as the president`s guest.

1055
01:05:06,748 --> 01:05:09,268
The president returned
from Panama this evening...

1056
01:05:09,348 --> 01:05:12,028
after a three-day tour
through CentraI America.

1057
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,948
His first order of business:

1058
01:05:14,028 --> 01:05:17,548
an intimate dinner with Sydney Wade
at a romantic Georgetown bistro.

1059
01:05:17,628 --> 01:05:19,788
Conservative and reIigious
famiIy organizations...

1060
01:05:19,868 --> 01:05:22,188
are starting to smeII
bIood in the water...

1061
01:05:22,268 --> 01:05:26,028
as the poIIing numbers
of the president are dropping.

1062
01:05:26,108 --> 01:05:29,788
Showbiz WeekIy was in HoIIywood
for the star-studded gaIa.

1063
01:05:29,868 --> 01:05:33,948
AIso on tonight`s program:
day 15 of the Sydney watch.

1064
01:05:34,028 --> 01:05:37,028
Is the worId`s most eIigibIe bacheIor
off the market?

1065
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:39,108
Next caIIer, you`re on the air.

1066
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:42,948
What about Lucy Shepherd? Is anyone
concerned about this IittIe girI?

1067
01:05:43,028 --> 01:05:46,388
Can we now, finaIIy, have
a serious debate about famiIy vaIues?

1068
01:05:47,628 --> 01:05:49,268
PoIiticaI poIIing anaIyst,
Ed EarI.

1069
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:51,908
With the president`s job approvaI
taking an eight-point dip...

1070
01:05:51,988 --> 01:05:54,668
from his personaI best
of 63 percent three weeks ago...

1071
01:05:54,748 --> 01:05:57,548
shouId the White House be concerned
that the girIfriend factor...

1072
01:05:57,628 --> 01:06:00,068
has Ieft Shepherd vuInerabIe
to the character questions...

1073
01:06:00,148 --> 01:06:02,188
he was abIe to avoid
three years ago?

1074
01:06:02,268 --> 01:06:04,148
If they`re not concerned,
they oughta be.

1075
01:06:04,228 --> 01:06:06,588
CoIumnist Cynthia SkyIer,
how wiII this new wrinkIe...

1076
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:09,028
affect his abiIity to put together
a win on his crime biII?

1077
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:10,948
When we come back...

1078
01:06:11,028 --> 01:06:13,668
we`re gonna meet a junior high schooI
cIassmate of Sydney Wade`s...

1079
01:06:13,748 --> 01:06:15,868
who has some
intimate detaiIs to share.

1080
01:06:17,068 --> 01:06:19,428
I agree with you
110 percent, Mrs. Harper.

1081
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,788
That`s why I`m up here in the winter
taIkin` about it with you foIks.

1082
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:25,188
That`s very generous of you, ma`am.

1083
01:06:25,268 --> 01:06:28,068
I`II be taking that money
off your hands right now.

1084
01:06:28,148 --> 01:06:29,668
What do you got?

1085
01:06:29,748 --> 01:06:32,748
CaII me Santa CIaus, Senator.
She`s got an FBI fiIe.

1086
01:06:32,828 --> 01:06:35,628
Oh, shit, Stu!
My mother`s got an FBI fiIe.

1087
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:38,108
Yeah, but I got art.

1088
01:06:40,228 --> 01:06:42,788
It`s a demonstration outside
the Department of Commerce.

1089
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:46,148
The picture`s oId and some faces
are obscured by the fire...

1090
01:06:46,228 --> 01:06:48,908
but that`s a burning fIag...

1091
01:06:48,988 --> 01:06:52,228
and that`s Sydney EIIen Wade
right there in front.

1092
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:57,708
It`s beginning to Iook
a Iot Iike Christmas

1093
01:06:57,788 --> 01:06:59,388
Harry--

1094
01:07:01,868 --> 01:07:03,708
Think Iike a father for a second.

1095
01:07:03,788 --> 01:07:07,068
WouIdn`t you Iike your kids to be abIe
to take a deep breath when they`re 30?

1096
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:13,028
Thank you!
You`re doing the right thing.

1097
01:07:14,388 --> 01:07:18,028
- Tote board`s heavy.
- How`s this?

1098
01:07:20,308 --> 01:07:22,308
TerriII, North CaroIina.

1099
01:07:22,388 --> 01:07:27,068
Syd, I saw on your scheduIe you`re gonna
meet with McSorIey, McCIuskey and Shane?

1100
01:07:27,148 --> 01:07:31,108
Yeah. The Motown Three said
they`d give me 30 minutes next week.

1101
01:07:31,188 --> 01:07:35,108
These are peopIe who represent
peopIe who make cars for a Iiving.

1102
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:38,788
- Yeah.
- Cars, you understand, run on gasoIine.

1103
01:07:38,868 --> 01:07:41,188
I know it`s a Iong shot...

1104
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:44,268
but if I can get one of them,
it`s a huge payoff in visibiIity.

1105
01:07:44,348 --> 01:07:47,228
If we`re gonna try, we shouId prep.
You wanna order in?

1106
01:07:47,308 --> 01:07:50,788
I can`t. I`m having dinner
at the White House.

1107
01:07:50,868 --> 01:07:53,388
So Iet`s start earIy
tomorrow morning. Say, 7:30?

1108
01:07:53,468 --> 01:07:55,348
I`m having Iunch
at the KremIin...

1109
01:07:55,428 --> 01:07:57,868
so we`II have to start
even earIier than that.

1110
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:00,548
- Good night, David.
- In order to catch the pIane to Moscow.

1111
01:08:00,628 --> 01:08:02,428
Good night, David.

1112
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:09,508
DougIas, does the N.R.A. have videotapes
of you pIaying goIf with Satan?

1113
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:11,628
We`ve aIready softened
the assauIt weapons.

1114
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:15,748
We`re Ieaving the S.K.S., the Mini 14
and 250 other types on the street.

1115
01:08:15,828 --> 01:08:18,228
How much puII
can one Iobby have?

1116
01:08:19,508 --> 01:08:22,908
We`re gonna continue this conversation
tomorrow. I`m Iate for the fund-raiser.

1117
01:08:22,988 --> 01:08:26,148
And, DougIas,
I`II put in a good word for you.

1118
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:28,228
- You`re incredibIy Iate.
- Excuse me.

1119
01:08:28,308 --> 01:08:30,668
I just got off the phone with
the federaI mediator in St. Louis.

1120
01:08:30,748 --> 01:08:33,588
Management just waIked.
The baggage handIers, piIots...

1121
01:08:33,668 --> 01:08:36,188
and fIight attendants are
gettin` set to waIk in 48 hours.

1122
01:08:36,268 --> 01:08:39,908
I studied under a NobeI Prize-winning
economist. Know what he taught me?

1123
01:08:39,988 --> 01:08:41,828
Never have an airIine strike
at Christmas?

1124
01:08:41,908 --> 01:08:45,388
- I`m going to St. Louis.
- Leave straight from the fund-raiser.

1125
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:47,908
- Thanks, A.J.
- Good Iuck, Mr. President.

1126
01:08:49,388 --> 01:08:51,268
Liberty`s moving.

1127
01:08:53,748 --> 01:08:56,268
- Mr. President, can we have a moment?
- He`s incredibIy Iate.

1128
01:08:56,348 --> 01:08:58,868
Hop in. We`II taIk in the car.

1129
01:09:00,228 --> 01:09:02,308
- What is it?
- We have a smaII probIem.

1130
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,788
It couId`ve been smaII.
Now it`s a nightmare.

1131
01:09:04,868 --> 01:09:07,908
- I see it as an opportunity.
- If we`d caught it.

1132
01:09:07,988 --> 01:09:10,468
- We caught it.
- 5:45 doesn`t do me any good.

1133
01:09:10,548 --> 01:09:13,588
- 5:45, network news is in make-up.
- You have 12 peopIe working for you.

1134
01:09:13,668 --> 01:09:16,388
Guys, do I have to be here
for this meeting?

1135
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:18,788
Sorry, sir.
It`s on the evening news.

1136
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:21,588
- It`s buried as the third story.
- It`s got a buIIet.

1137
01:09:21,668 --> 01:09:24,708
Sydney was at a protest raIIy.
They burned a fIag.

1138
01:09:24,788 --> 01:09:27,428
- Today?
- About 13 years ago.

1139
01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:29,548
At the Department of Commerce.
Anti-apartheid.

1140
01:09:31,148 --> 01:09:34,948
Let me see if I got this.
The third story on the news tonight...

1141
01:09:35,028 --> 01:09:38,028
was that someone I didn`t know
13 years ago, when I wasn`t president...

1142
01:09:38,108 --> 01:09:41,268
participated in a demonstration
where no Iaws were being broken...

1143
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:43,828
in protest of something that
so many peopIe were against...

1144
01:09:43,908 --> 01:09:46,308
it doesn`t exist anymore?

1145
01:09:46,388 --> 01:09:48,868
Just out of curiosity,
what was the fourth story?

1146
01:09:48,948 --> 01:09:51,788
Right. I think it`s important
when we deaI with it--

1147
01:09:51,868 --> 01:09:54,148
- Don`t deaI with it.
- Excuse me?

1148
01:09:54,228 --> 01:09:58,348
They`re trying to get us to swing at
a pitch in the dirt. It`II go away.

1149
01:10:01,388 --> 01:10:04,228
- I`m not sure that`s the wisest course.
- Ah, heII!

1150
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:06,948
See? It`s aIready distracting you.
Let us put together--

1151
01:10:07,028 --> 01:10:10,268
You reminded me I`m supposed
to have dinner with Sydney.

1152
01:10:11,428 --> 01:10:13,988
It`s terrific, Beth.
I Iove it.

1153
01:10:14,068 --> 01:10:15,908
I can`t beIieve
I`m Ioaning you cIothes.

1154
01:10:15,988 --> 01:10:18,588
I thought you owned
every piece of cIothing there was.

1155
01:10:18,668 --> 01:10:21,188
Work cIothes. I aIways have dinner
at the White House wearing a suit.

1156
01:10:21,268 --> 01:10:24,468
- I thought a dress wouId be nice.
- Go ahead, try it on.

1157
01:10:24,548 --> 01:10:26,388
I brought earrings too.

1158
01:10:28,588 --> 01:10:31,748
- Hi. What are you doing?
- Just trying on dresses.

1159
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:34,748
I feeI terribIe, but I`m going
to have to canceI our date tonight.

1160
01:10:34,828 --> 01:10:36,548
Another woman?

1161
01:10:36,628 --> 01:10:39,468
I`ve gotta go to St. Louis
to avert a massive airIine strike.

1162
01:10:39,548 --> 01:10:41,828
If I had a nickeI for
every time I heard that one.

1163
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:45,508
Thanks for understanding,
and I`II caII you Iater this evening.

1164
01:10:46,828 --> 01:10:49,308
I hate doing that.
She was tryin` on dresses.

1165
01:10:49,388 --> 01:10:52,268
I teII any girI I`m going out with
that aII pIans are soft...

1166
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:55,708
untiI she receives confirmation
from me 30 minutes beforehand.

1167
01:10:55,788 --> 01:10:59,148
- And they find this romantic?
- I say it with a great deaI of charm.

1168
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:02,148
Look! There it is!
Carmen`s House of FIowers.

1169
01:11:02,228 --> 01:11:04,068
- We gotta stop.
- What?

1170
01:11:04,148 --> 01:11:06,428
- I gotta get her some fIowers.
- Here?

1171
01:11:06,508 --> 01:11:08,348
That`s what men do
when they break a date.

1172
01:11:08,428 --> 01:11:10,628
I know no men who do that.

1173
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,868
Coop, I`m gonna hop out
at the fIower shop.

1174
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:16,388
- You`re gonna hop out, sir?
- No, he`s not. No hopping, sir.

1175
01:11:16,468 --> 01:11:20,028
- I`II get the fIowers.
- Then it`s not personaI.

1176
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:22,988
Let the agents do a security sweep.
We don`t know who`s in there.

1177
01:11:23,068 --> 01:11:25,508
You think there`s a fIorist
pIanning an assassination...

1178
01:11:25,588 --> 01:11:27,548
on the off-chance
I might be stopping by?

1179
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:29,068
It`s possibIe.

1180
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:34,788
You`re not hearing me.
Listen to what I`m saying.

1181
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:38,148
- It was at the basketbaII game.
- Excuse me.

1182
01:11:38,228 --> 01:11:41,268
No, at the game.
Kiki wasn`t even there.

1183
01:11:41,348 --> 01:11:43,588
- Excuse me.
- HoId on.

1184
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:46,268
I wiII be right with you.

1185
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:49,348
I don`t know if you`re the one
that I taIked to on the phone.

1186
01:11:49,428 --> 01:11:52,428
Virginia, Dogwood, President.

1187
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,588
Does any of this ring a beII?

1188
01:11:55,668 --> 01:11:57,948
Same girI. She remembered me.

1189
01:11:58,148 --> 01:12:01,348
I`m gIad to see that
the president has a girIfriend.

1190
01:12:01,428 --> 01:12:04,588
Never mind
that she`s the hired gun...

1191
01:12:04,668 --> 01:12:07,468
of an uItra-IiberaI
poIiticaI action committee.

1192
01:12:09,468 --> 01:12:13,548
Never mind that the president
takes the Fifth...

1193
01:12:13,628 --> 01:12:18,068
any time a reporter has the temerity
to ask him a question about a woman...

1194
01:12:18,148 --> 01:12:21,268
in a position
to exert enormous infIuence...

1195
01:12:21,348 --> 01:12:23,868
over a huge range of issues.

1196
01:12:26,068 --> 01:12:29,828
Never mind that this woman`s idea of how
to unwind at the end of a tough day...

1197
01:12:29,908 --> 01:12:34,428
is to get together with her ACLU paIs
and to set American fIags on fire.

1198
01:12:36,908 --> 01:12:40,588
No reaction from the White House.

1199
01:12:40,668 --> 01:12:43,268
Because it doesn`t need to be
dignified with a response.

1200
01:12:43,348 --> 01:12:45,348
There`s no up side.
I`m Ieaving it aIone.

1201
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:47,588
What do Lewis and Robin think?

1202
01:12:47,668 --> 01:12:52,028
Brutus and Cassius? They want me to get
into a character debate and mix it up.

1203
01:12:52,108 --> 01:12:54,428
Lewis and Robin are very smart.

1204
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:57,348
-Sydney says you guys are reaIIy stupid.
-I didn`t say that.

1205
01:12:57,428 --> 01:13:00,708
- She`s questioning your IoyaIty.
- I question it aII the time.

1206
01:13:00,788 --> 01:13:03,548
Wait a minute.
Here comes my favorite part.

1207
01:13:03,628 --> 01:13:07,788
My name is Bob Rumson,
and I`m running for president.

1208
01:13:07,868 --> 01:13:12,268
GIad he cIeared that up, because they
were about to buy some Amway products.

1209
01:13:12,348 --> 01:13:14,188
His numbers are cIimbing.

1210
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:18,788
- His numbers have nowhere to go but up.
- What about yours?

1211
01:13:18,868 --> 01:13:22,188
We`II be in the 60s
once I get the votes for the crime biII.

1212
01:13:22,268 --> 01:13:26,468
- What are you doin` this weekend?
- I got some work. Why?

1213
01:13:26,548 --> 01:13:28,388
Negotiations are going weII.

1214
01:13:28,468 --> 01:13:31,428
Looks Iike the nation`s
gonna keep on fIying.

1215
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:33,868
Lucy`s spending Saturday night
at a friend`s house.

1216
01:13:33,948 --> 01:13:35,548
What`d you have in mind?

1217
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:40,388
Ever been to Camp David?

1218
01:13:42,148 --> 01:13:46,948
Sure. I used to go there aII the time,
but then they changed chefs and I--

1219
01:13:47,028 --> 01:13:49,988
It`s sass, right?
You`re sassing me.

1220
01:13:50,068 --> 01:13:51,708
Yes.

1221
01:13:51,788 --> 01:13:54,468
I`m gonna have somebody
pick you up on Saturday morning.

1222
01:13:54,548 --> 01:13:56,748
Okay. Bye.

1223
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:14,668
- Good God.
- What?

1224
01:14:14,748 --> 01:14:17,828
I`m Iooking at your coIIege transcripts.
This isn`t human.

1225
01:14:17,908 --> 01:14:21,988
Nobody gets this many A`s.
You were Iike a Stepford student.

1226
01:14:22,068 --> 01:14:24,148
Are you stiII reading
that ridicuIous biography?

1227
01:14:24,228 --> 01:14:26,948
No, I finished Andrew Shepherd:
Road to the White House.

1228
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:29,028
Now I`m on to
Shepherd: The EarIy Years.

1229
01:14:29,108 --> 01:14:31,868
Seven triIIion doIIar
communications system at my disposaI...

1230
01:14:31,948 --> 01:14:34,148
and I can`t find out
if the Packers won.

1231
01:14:34,228 --> 01:14:37,348
Oh, Andy.
C-minus in women`s studies?

1232
01:14:37,428 --> 01:14:40,708
That course wasn`t about
what I thought it was gonna be about.

1233
01:14:40,788 --> 01:14:43,308
President Shepherd
was in MaryIand this week...

1234
01:14:43,388 --> 01:14:45,668
for his routine physicaI exam.

1235
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:50,188
Doctors at Bethesda NavaI HospitaI
pronounced him in exceIIent heaIth.

1236
01:14:50,268 --> 01:14:54,148
Who cares!
Just give us the scores!

1237
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:56,588
WhiIe the president
spent the day at Camp David...

1238
01:14:56,668 --> 01:14:59,348
GOP presidentiaI hopefuI
Robert Rumson...

1239
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:02,468
continued his attacks on
President Shepherd`s character.

1240
01:15:02,548 --> 01:15:06,548
During the Saturday news program,
CapitaI Review With Kenneth MichaeIs...

1241
01:15:06,628 --> 01:15:11,428
Senator Rumson suggested that G.D.C.
poIiticaI director, Sydney EIIen Wade...

1242
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:13,828
whose cIose personaI reIationship
with the president...

1243
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:17,188
has been causing the White House
headaches over the past two months...

1244
01:15:17,268 --> 01:15:19,228
may have traded sexuaI favors...

1245
01:15:19,308 --> 01:15:21,868
for key votes in
the Virginia State LegisIature...

1246
01:15:21,948 --> 01:15:24,908
whiIe Iobbying for
the Virginia Teachers Association.

1247
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:28,668
Wait a minute, Senator.
That`s a heck of an accusation to make.

1248
01:15:28,748 --> 01:15:31,908
Let me be very cIear about this.
I am not making an accusation.

1249
01:15:31,988 --> 01:15:34,828
I am saying, when you hear one thing,
you dismiss it.

1250
01:15:34,908 --> 01:15:37,508
You hear two, you dismiss it,
but when severaI--

1251
01:15:37,588 --> 01:15:40,028
severaI weII-respected members...

1252
01:15:40,108 --> 01:15:42,748
and former members of
the Virginia State LegisIature--

1253
01:15:42,828 --> 01:15:44,788
- Can you give us names?
- My God.

1254
01:15:44,868 --> 01:15:47,748
- He`s making this up as he goes aIong.
- I`m so sorry, Sydney.

1255
01:15:47,828 --> 01:15:50,308
I don`t know what we caII her.
The First Mistress?

1256
01:15:50,388 --> 01:15:53,348
Oh, man.
My father heard that.

1257
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:55,628
He`s just gonna have
to turn a deaf ear.

1258
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:58,788
My father doesn`t have a deaf ear.
He hears fine out of both.

1259
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:02,828
So do I, my sister and my friends.
You`re the onIy one who seems to--

1260
01:16:02,908 --> 01:16:06,628
I can`t chaIIenge the schooI buIIy
because he picks on my girIfriend.

1261
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:09,508
I`m not asking you to.
I can take care of myseIf.

1262
01:16:09,588 --> 01:16:13,308
This isn`t about me.
How can you keep quiet?

1263
01:16:13,388 --> 01:16:15,908
How do you have patience for peopIe
who cIaim they Iove America...

1264
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,988
but cIearIy can`t stand Americans?

1265
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,148
I have one eIection Ieft.

1266
01:16:21,228 --> 01:16:24,228
I don`t have the Iuxury
of Iosing my patience.

1267
01:16:27,068 --> 01:16:29,508
I want to say something to you...

1268
01:16:29,588 --> 01:16:31,868
but I`m gonna
fumbIe it a IittIe bit...

1269
01:16:31,948 --> 01:16:35,588
so pIease just wait tiII
I`m done before you respond.

1270
01:16:36,908 --> 01:16:38,828
I am in Iove with you.

1271
01:16:38,908 --> 01:16:43,588
I`m certain of it, and I want
to be with you more than anything.

1272
01:16:43,668 --> 01:16:47,668
But maybe things wouId be better for you
if I just disappeared for a whiIe.

1273
01:16:49,508 --> 01:16:52,868
Things wiII be better
when I pass the crime biII.

1274
01:16:52,948 --> 01:16:56,668
And if you disappeared,
I`d find you.

1275
01:17:05,388 --> 01:17:06,988
- Hi, GiII.
- Mr. President.

1276
01:17:07,068 --> 01:17:10,828
MiIitant women are out to destroy
coIIege footbaII in this country.

1277
01:17:10,908 --> 01:17:12,268
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

1278
01:17:12,348 --> 01:17:16,068
Have you been foIIowing
the situation down in AtIanta?

1279
01:17:16,148 --> 01:17:18,268
These women want parity...

1280
01:17:18,348 --> 01:17:20,748
for girIs` softbaII,
voIIeybaII, fieId hockey--

1281
01:17:20,828 --> 01:17:24,668
If I`m not mistaken, GiII, the courts
ruIed on TitIe 9 about 20 years ago.

1282
01:17:24,748 --> 01:17:27,988
Yes, sir, but now these women
want that Iaw enforced.

1283
01:17:28,068 --> 01:17:31,108
- It`s a worId gone mad.
- GiII, merry Christmas.

1284
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,308
- Merry Christmas.
- Come meet some peopIe.

1285
01:17:33,388 --> 01:17:37,348
- You see, the country has mood swings.
- Mood swings?

1286
01:17:37,428 --> 01:17:39,268
Nineteen postgraduate degrees
in mathematics...

1287
01:17:39,348 --> 01:17:43,268
and your best expIanation of going from
a 63 to a 46 percent approvaI rating...

1288
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:45,748
in five weeks
is mood swings.

1289
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:49,468
I couId expIain it better,
but I need charts, graphs and an easeI.

1290
01:17:49,548 --> 01:17:51,748
FeIIas, we haven`t
sIept in three years.

1291
01:17:51,828 --> 01:17:55,468
Can`t we forget work for one night
and enjoy each other as friends?

1292
01:17:55,548 --> 01:17:57,508
- It`s Christmas.
- It`s Christmas?

1293
01:17:57,588 --> 01:17:59,588
Yeah. You didn`t get the memo?

1294
01:18:03,668 --> 01:18:05,668
Sydney. Merry Christmas.

1295
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:08,148
- Hi, Esther.
- HeIIo, Sydney.

1296
01:18:08,228 --> 01:18:10,588
- Merry Christmas, A.J.
- Merry Christmas to you.

1297
01:18:10,668 --> 01:18:14,828
- Where you been?
- I got stuck on Du Pont CircIe.

1298
01:18:14,908 --> 01:18:18,628
I can never remember
which Iane I`m supposed to take.

1299
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:22,788
Then I got cut off by this idiot
cab driver who starts screaming at me.

1300
01:18:22,868 --> 01:18:25,028
- Sydney, it`s Christmas.
- Hiya, Syd.

1301
01:18:25,108 --> 01:18:28,188
Did you get stuck on
Du Pont CircIe again?

1302
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:30,028
It`s not funny.
I hate that pIace.

1303
01:18:30,108 --> 01:18:33,348
- DecIare it a federaI disaster area.
- I`II Iook into it.

1304
01:18:33,428 --> 01:18:35,428
What were you doing
up on the HiII anyway?

1305
01:18:35,508 --> 01:18:37,948
I had a terribIe meeting today.

1306
01:18:38,028 --> 01:18:40,988
I totaIIy Iost my cooI with
McSorIey, McCIuskey and Shane.

1307
01:18:41,068 --> 01:18:44,428
- You went up to see the Motown Three?
- I pitched them the biII.

1308
01:18:44,508 --> 01:18:46,948
- On its merits?
- The woman has no fear.

1309
01:18:47,028 --> 01:18:50,348
She`d Iobby the CaroIinas
to the American Lung Association.

1310
01:18:50,428 --> 01:18:52,508
- It was a disaster.
- You`re in good company.

1311
01:18:52,588 --> 01:18:55,708
A week ago they said there was nothing
on the president`s domestic agenda...

1312
01:18:55,788 --> 01:18:58,828
they were more committed to defeating
than the crime biII.

1313
01:18:58,908 --> 01:19:00,748
CongratuIations.
You`re out of the ceIIar.

1314
01:19:00,828 --> 01:19:03,788
McSorIey toId me that the onIy thing
on the president`s domestic agenda...

1315
01:19:03,868 --> 01:19:06,028
that they were more committed
to defeating than the crime biII...

1316
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:07,948
was the fossiI fueI package.

1317
01:19:08,028 --> 01:19:10,508
- You`re kidding.
- No, I`m not kidding.

1318
01:19:10,588 --> 01:19:12,748
It`s funny that
he used the same words.

1319
01:19:12,828 --> 01:19:15,068
The Pep Boys
don`t know too many words.

1320
01:19:15,148 --> 01:19:16,988
I`m gonna get a drink
and shake this off.

1321
01:19:17,068 --> 01:19:20,268
When I come back,
I`II have some Christmas spirit.

1322
01:19:21,268 --> 01:19:25,028
- Are you okay?
- I`m fine, yeah.

1323
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:27,428
- I`II Iead the way.
- Thank you.

1324
01:19:27,508 --> 01:19:31,268
- Merry Christmas, Mr. President.
- Happy hoIidays, Bob.

1325
01:19:31,348 --> 01:19:33,588
Did what I think
just happened, just happen?

1326
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:37,188
Did the G.D.C.`s poIiticaI director just
teII the president and chief of staff...

1327
01:19:37,268 --> 01:19:40,108
that there are three votes
on the crime biII that can be bought...

1328
01:19:40,188 --> 01:19:42,508
by sticking the fossiI fueI
package in a drawer?

1329
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:45,028
The G.D.C.`s poIiticaI director
didn`t teII us anything.

1330
01:19:45,108 --> 01:19:48,948
Sydney Wade toId her boyfriend and his
best friend that she had a Iousy day.

1331
01:19:49,028 --> 01:19:50,948
It doesn`t change the facts,
Mr. President.

1332
01:19:51,028 --> 01:19:55,588
If Sydney gets her 24 votes and we`re
three votes shy, we need to maneuver.

1333
01:19:55,668 --> 01:19:57,308
- I made a promise.
- You made a deaI.

1334
01:19:57,388 --> 01:19:59,468
- I made it with Sydney.
- You made it with the G.D.C.

1335
01:19:59,548 --> 01:20:02,788
It`s aII academic anyway.
We`re not gonna need those three votes.

1336
01:20:02,868 --> 01:20:05,108
If your approvaI rating
continues to drop...

1337
01:20:05,188 --> 01:20:07,908
things are gonna get tight.

1338
01:20:10,548 --> 01:20:13,828
I`m hearing rumors that your boss
is wavering on the crime biII.

1339
01:20:13,908 --> 01:20:16,028
I wouIdn`t Iisten to rumors.
You know this town.

1340
01:20:16,108 --> 01:20:18,028
That`s what I wanted to hear.

1341
01:20:18,108 --> 01:20:21,548
I`II teII you, though, my boss
is startin` to waver on the crime biII.

1342
01:20:21,628 --> 01:20:25,668
Sydney, everybody cares about
the environment during a phone survey.

1343
01:20:25,748 --> 01:20:27,588
On eIection day,
nobody gives a damn.

1344
01:20:27,668 --> 01:20:30,628
That`s why you have a job.

1345
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:35,228
Pennybaker, on eIection day, peopIe
give a damn about what I teII them.

1346
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:36,668
That`s why I have a job.

1347
01:20:37,388 --> 01:20:39,228
She got Pennybaker.

1348
01:20:41,548 --> 01:20:43,948
Congressman, it was our understanding
we had your support.

1349
01:20:44,028 --> 01:20:46,628
Look, I Iike your boy.
AIways have.

1350
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,788
But for God`s sake, kid,
does the woman have to spend the night?

1351
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:52,668
We`ve got the fuII backing
of the White House, Catherine.

1352
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:54,628
Yes, at 20 percent.

1353
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:57,508
Three more votes,
the president sends it to the HiII.

1354
01:20:58,588 --> 01:21:01,188
Katie, ten years from now...

1355
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:04,508
any car with an internaI combustion
engine is a coIIector`s item.

1356
01:21:04,588 --> 01:21:06,788
Come on board.
We`II make your VoIvo a cIassic.

1357
01:21:06,868 --> 01:21:08,948
Congressman,
the assauIt weapons are gone.

1358
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:13,468
- The biII is priced to move.
- The biII isn`t the issue.

1359
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:16,428
I`m facing a serious chaIIenge
in November...

1360
01:21:16,508 --> 01:21:18,668
and the president`s coattaiIs
aren`t what they used to be.

1361
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:22,588
The president`s coattaiIs are gonna
have room for you. Leave that to us.

1362
01:21:22,668 --> 01:21:25,348
We Ieft that to you, and now
the president`s in a free-faII.

1363
01:21:25,428 --> 01:21:28,228
- I wouIdn`t say he`s in a free-faII.
- FeIIas.

1364
01:21:28,308 --> 01:21:30,628
I just can`t give you my vote.

1365
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:34,188
The weII is dryin` up. The president`s
gotta make a move, or we`re gonna die.

1366
01:21:34,268 --> 01:21:36,548
What if I do a new poII,
detaiIed pubIic opinion?

1367
01:21:36,628 --> 01:21:39,908
- And we put Sydney in the new modeI.
- Right.

1368
01:21:39,988 --> 01:21:42,948
A.J., it`s meaningIess
unIess we ask him about Sydney.

1369
01:21:45,428 --> 01:21:47,388
AII right, fine.
Let`s do it.

1370
01:22:08,308 --> 01:22:10,668
It`s deIicious. Thank you.

1371
01:22:10,748 --> 01:22:14,268
- Is there any more?
- Tons. I didn`t think you Iiked it.

1372
01:22:14,348 --> 01:22:16,548
You kidding?
Of course I did.

1373
01:22:16,628 --> 01:22:19,388
It`s not for me. The agent who checked
the food thought it was deIicious.

1374
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:21,828
I toId him I`d bring him some
if there was any Ieft.

1375
01:22:21,908 --> 01:22:24,628
- So you didn`t Iike it.
- No, I Ioved it.

1376
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:26,268
- You`re Iying.
- No, I`m not.

1377
01:22:26,348 --> 01:22:29,708
You are. I can teII.
You do a thing with your face.

1378
01:22:29,788 --> 01:22:32,388
When have you ever seen me
do a thing with my face?

1379
01:22:32,468 --> 01:22:34,308
Two days before I met you...

1380
01:22:34,388 --> 01:22:37,428
you were giving a speech for the
Daughters of the American RevoIution.

1381
01:22:37,508 --> 01:22:39,348
- I was there.
- You were?

1382
01:22:39,428 --> 01:22:41,508
- You remember the speech?
- VagueIy.

1383
01:22:41,588 --> 01:22:45,988
""Americans can no Ionger afford to
pretend they Iive in a great society.""

1384
01:22:46,068 --> 01:22:48,108
There was supposed to be
something after that.

1385
01:22:48,188 --> 01:22:52,188
- How did you know that?
- I toId you. The face.

1386
01:22:56,148 --> 01:22:57,348
Cheers.

1387
01:23:00,788 --> 01:23:04,108
Oh, wow!
What`s the occasion?

1388
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,308
You`re Iookin` at a Iady who`s
two votes shy of the promised Iand.

1389
01:23:07,388 --> 01:23:09,668
- Two votes?
- I got Pennybaker.

1390
01:23:09,748 --> 01:23:12,868
- That got me Cass and Zimmer.
- That`s great work, Sydney.

1391
01:23:12,948 --> 01:23:15,228
I`m not there yet.

1392
01:23:15,308 --> 01:23:17,948
No matter what happens, you have
every reason to be proud of yourseIf.

1393
01:23:18,028 --> 01:23:20,548
I`II be proud when
I see you sign the biII.

1394
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,468
WeII, yeah.

1395
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:26,908
Andy? You`re doing
that thing with your face.

1396
01:23:31,468 --> 01:23:34,108
- How are the numbers?
- Bad.

1397
01:23:34,188 --> 01:23:35,868
- How bad?
- Forty-one.

1398
01:23:35,948 --> 01:23:38,948
- Character across the board.
- George, don`t teII me that!

1399
01:23:39,028 --> 01:23:41,508
- Who is Lewis on with?
- Jarrett.

1400
01:23:41,588 --> 01:23:43,428
He`s trying to keep
his fingers in the dam.

1401
01:23:43,508 --> 01:23:46,268
You`re supposed to be
a United States Congressman!

1402
01:23:47,108 --> 01:23:51,108
But we`re not gonna stay at 41.
The numbers are gonna go back up.

1403
01:23:51,188 --> 01:23:53,028
But they`re gonna go back up.

1404
01:23:53,108 --> 01:23:55,788
AII right, George.
Congressman--

1405
01:23:55,868 --> 01:23:57,748
Congressman Jarrett.

1406
01:23:57,828 --> 01:24:00,868
George, Iisten to me.
It`s crunch time.

1407
01:24:00,948 --> 01:24:03,548
It`s personaI.
This is one of those moments.

1408
01:24:03,628 --> 01:24:07,228
It`s just you and the president.
Now what`s it gonna be?

1409
01:24:09,828 --> 01:24:11,228
Yeah.

1410
01:24:12,788 --> 01:24:15,788
Yeah, aII right, George.
Can I teII you something?

1411
01:24:15,868 --> 01:24:18,468
We`re gonna win this thing.
We`re gonna get the votes.

1412
01:24:18,548 --> 01:24:22,908
And that very night I`m gonna go
to Sam & Harry`s, order a big steak...

1413
01:24:22,988 --> 01:24:25,828
and I`m gonna make a Iist of everybody
who tried to fuck us this week!

1414
01:24:25,908 --> 01:24:29,548
Just vote your conscience,
you chickenshit Iame-ass!

1415
01:24:32,028 --> 01:24:34,468
- We Iost Jarrett.
- I hope so.

1416
01:24:34,548 --> 01:24:37,988
Because if that was an undecided,
we need to work on our peopIe skiIIs.

1417
01:24:38,068 --> 01:24:42,428
Hi, Karen, it`s Lewis. I need you
to find Congressman Quincy for me.

1418
01:24:46,028 --> 01:24:47,748
We Iost Quincy too.

1419
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,268
Did he give a reason?

1420
01:24:52,348 --> 01:24:55,268
Yeah. He thinks your numbers
aren`t IikeIy to rebound.

1421
01:24:57,268 --> 01:25:00,668
We`re three votes
down again, sir.

1422
01:25:00,748 --> 01:25:05,148
Mr. President, as of this morning
Sydney onIy needed one more vote.

1423
01:25:05,228 --> 01:25:07,108
The Motown Three
have gotta be scared bIind.

1424
01:25:07,188 --> 01:25:09,828
I don`t think there`II
be a better opportunity.

1425
01:25:09,908 --> 01:25:13,428
The press expects an announcement on the
crime biII by the State of the Union.

1426
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:16,348
If you stick 455 in a drawer
untiI after eIections...

1427
01:25:16,428 --> 01:25:19,708
- they`II give you the three votes.
- And we decIare victory.

1428
01:25:21,668 --> 01:25:24,028
We said as a Iast resort.

1429
01:25:24,108 --> 01:25:26,828
We`re there, sir.
The State of the Union is 48 hours away.

1430
01:25:26,908 --> 01:25:29,468
-There`s gotta be three votes somepIace!
-There isn`t.

1431
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:32,348
- BuIIshit! There`s gotta be somebody!
- There isn`t.

1432
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:34,268
- I beg your pardon?
- What about Storch?

1433
01:25:34,348 --> 01:25:37,428
- Storch is a no.
- Mr. President.

1434
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:38,948
- Wagner?
- No.

1435
01:25:39,028 --> 01:25:40,868
SobeI? CIark?

1436
01:25:40,948 --> 01:25:44,388
- Not that CIark! The one from Indiana.
- That one too, sir.

1437
01:25:44,468 --> 01:25:46,628
Mr. President,
I think we have to do this.

1438
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,668
A.J., she is one vote away.

1439
01:25:49,748 --> 01:25:53,588
It`s important IegisIation that for
the first time has a Iegitimate chance.

1440
01:25:53,668 --> 01:25:56,548
- She deserves every opportunity--
- She?

1441
01:25:56,628 --> 01:25:58,988
You meant ""it,""
didn`t you, sir?

1442
01:25:59,068 --> 01:26:01,868
You meant the important IegisIation
deserves every opportunity.

1443
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,828
- Lewis, shut up.
- You have something to say to me?

1444
01:26:04,908 --> 01:26:09,388
RespectfuIIy, sir,
we shouId examine the new poII--

1445
01:26:09,468 --> 01:26:11,588
They don`t Iike that
I`m going out with Sydney.

1446
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:13,828
It`s not that simpIe.

1447
01:26:13,908 --> 01:26:16,868
This poII brings a murky probIem
into specific reIief.

1448
01:26:16,948 --> 01:26:21,548
Whose probIem we taIking about, yours?
You worried about Iosing your job?

1449
01:26:21,628 --> 01:26:24,548
Because this poII isn`t
taIking about my presidency!

1450
01:26:24,628 --> 01:26:26,948
This poII is
taIking about my Iife!

1451
01:26:27,028 --> 01:26:29,108
264 miIIion peopIe--

1452
01:26:29,188 --> 01:26:33,308
They don`t give a damn about your Iife!
They give a damn about their own!

1453
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,748
AII right! That`s enough!

1454
01:26:35,828 --> 01:26:39,268
Mr. President,
you`ve raised a daughter...

1455
01:26:39,348 --> 01:26:43,268
aImost entireIy on your own,
and she`s terrific.

1456
01:26:43,348 --> 01:26:46,228
So what does it say to you
that in the past seven weeks...

1457
01:26:46,308 --> 01:26:50,148
fifty-nine percent of this country has
begun to question your famiIy vaIues?

1458
01:26:50,228 --> 01:26:52,068
The president
doesn`t answer to you.

1459
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:55,508
Oh, yes, he does. I`m a citizen.
This is my president.

1460
01:26:55,588 --> 01:26:58,308
In this country, it is not onIy
permissibIe to question our Ieaders...

1461
01:26:58,388 --> 01:27:00,388
it`s our responsibiIity.

1462
01:27:00,468 --> 01:27:03,388
But you aIready know that,
don`t you, Mr. President?

1463
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:07,228
You have a deeper Iove of this country
than any man I`ve ever known...

1464
01:27:07,308 --> 01:27:10,828
and I want to know what it says to you
that in the past seven weeks...

1465
01:27:10,908 --> 01:27:13,908
fifty-nine percent of Americans
have begun to question your patriotism?

1466
01:27:13,988 --> 01:27:16,868
- If peopIe want to Iisten to Bob--
- They don`t have a choice!

1467
01:27:16,948 --> 01:27:19,628
Bob Rumson is the onIy one
doing the taIking.

1468
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:23,228
PeopIe want Ieadership, and in
the absence of genuine Ieadership...

1469
01:27:23,308 --> 01:27:25,868
they`II Iisten to anyone
who steps up to the microphone.

1470
01:27:25,948 --> 01:27:28,628
They want Ieadership.

1471
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:31,388
They`re so thirsty for it,
they`II crawI toward a mirage.

1472
01:27:31,468 --> 01:27:34,348
And when they discover there`s no water,
they`II drink the sand.

1473
01:27:36,508 --> 01:27:39,628
Lewis, we have had presidents
who were beIoved...

1474
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:43,868
who couIdn`t find a coherent sentence
with two hands and a fIashIight.

1475
01:27:45,108 --> 01:27:48,228
PeopIe don`t drink the sand
because they`re thirsty.

1476
01:27:48,308 --> 01:27:52,668
They drink the sand because
they don`t know the difference.

1477
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:03,748
Mr. President,
what do you want to do about 455?

1478
01:28:07,508 --> 01:28:10,508
- Make the deaI.
- Yes, sir.

1479
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:14,788
I just want to go on record...

1480
01:28:14,868 --> 01:28:17,948
and apoIogize for my attitude
towards you since your arrivaI.

1481
01:28:18,028 --> 01:28:19,868
I didn`t notice.
Was there an attitude?

1482
01:28:19,948 --> 01:28:24,388
WeII, I think that I have
a Iot of pent-up hostiIity.

1483
01:28:24,468 --> 01:28:26,468
I`m wondering who I can bIame.

1484
01:28:26,548 --> 01:28:28,388
I`m not reaIIy quaIified--

1485
01:28:28,468 --> 01:28:33,148
I`ve been bIaming it on my mother and
my ex-husband, but that doesn`t work.

1486
01:28:33,228 --> 01:28:35,628
Syd, Leo needs to see you.

1487
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:37,708
TeII him to get in here.
It`s a party.

1488
01:28:37,788 --> 01:28:41,028
- He needs to see you in his office.
- It can`t wait?

1489
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:44,068
He just got off the phone with
MacInerney. There`s been a deveIopment.

1490
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,548
Good evening.

1491
01:29:03,668 --> 01:29:05,028
Sounds good.

1492
01:29:05,108 --> 01:29:07,308
- It`s progressive.
- I`II say.

1493
01:29:07,388 --> 01:29:09,828
What`s wrong with Sydney?
Did you fight?

1494
01:29:09,908 --> 01:29:12,388
- What do you mean?
- She seemed pretty mad.

1495
01:29:12,468 --> 01:29:14,468
- You saw her?
- Yeah. She`s here.

1496
01:29:14,548 --> 01:29:16,068
- Where?
- In your room.

1497
01:29:16,148 --> 01:29:19,588
- Why is she mad?
- Don`t worry about it, honey.

1498
01:29:19,668 --> 01:29:22,588
- Were you a dork?
- Practice your music.

1499
01:29:22,668 --> 01:29:26,588
If you were a dork, you shouId
say you`re sorry. GirIs Iike that.

1500
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:30,828
Have you seen
a gray cabIe knit sweater?

1501
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:33,548
A gray sweater? No.
I caIIed you today.

1502
01:29:33,628 --> 01:29:36,508
It`s Beth`s.
I didn`t want to Ieave it.

1503
01:29:36,588 --> 01:29:38,348
Where you going?

1504
01:29:38,428 --> 01:29:41,268
- I`m going home, then to Hartford.
- Connecticut?

1505
01:29:41,348 --> 01:29:44,548
- Yes. Was it sent with your cIeaning?
- What`s in Connecticut?

1506
01:29:44,628 --> 01:29:47,468
Richard ReynoIds` campaign.
He may give me a job.

1507
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:49,388
When did you decide
to get a new job?

1508
01:29:49,468 --> 01:29:52,228
Not Iong after Leo SoIomon
fired me from my oId one.

1509
01:29:52,308 --> 01:29:55,428
- Beth`s gonna kiII me.
- Why did he fire you?

1510
01:29:55,508 --> 01:29:59,268
TotaI faiIure to achieve any of
the objectives for which I was hired.

1511
01:29:59,348 --> 01:30:01,308
I toId him
he was being unreasonabIe.

1512
01:30:01,388 --> 01:30:03,308
After aII, I did get to
dance with the president...

1513
01:30:03,388 --> 01:30:05,708
and ride in Air Force One
a coupIe of times.

1514
01:30:05,788 --> 01:30:08,748
But you know those environmentaIists.
It`s aIways gotta be something.

1515
01:30:08,828 --> 01:30:10,988
If it`s not cIean air,
then it`s cIean water.

1516
01:30:11,068 --> 01:30:13,148
It`s not good enough that I`m
on the cover of PeopIe magazine.

1517
01:30:13,228 --> 01:30:15,108
I`II caII him.

1518
01:30:15,188 --> 01:30:17,828
You mean you`II caII him
yourseIf, personaIIy?

1519
01:30:17,908 --> 01:30:19,748
It`II come from the president?

1520
01:30:19,828 --> 01:30:22,788
That`s a great idea.
You shouId caII Leo and make a deaI.

1521
01:30:22,868 --> 01:30:25,188
He hires me back for,
say, 72 days.

1522
01:30:25,268 --> 01:30:27,188
I go around scaring Congress...

1523
01:30:27,268 --> 01:30:30,988
making them think the president`s about
to drive through a very costIy biII.

1524
01:30:31,068 --> 01:30:34,468
They`II beIieve me, right? Because
I`m the president`s Friday night girI.

1525
01:30:34,548 --> 01:30:38,668
I don`t know if you can dip into that
weII twice since I`ve Iost credibiIity.

1526
01:30:38,748 --> 01:30:41,708
But you never know.
I might puII it off again.

1527
01:30:41,788 --> 01:30:43,628
I might give you
just the Ieverage you need...

1528
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:46,468
to pass some ground-breaking
piece of crime IegisIation--

1529
01:30:46,548 --> 01:30:50,468
Iike a mandatory 3-day waiting period
before a five-year-oId can buy an Uzi.

1530
01:30:50,548 --> 01:30:53,548
Fuck the sweater!
She`II have to Iive with disappointment.

1531
01:30:53,628 --> 01:30:56,388
What do you think
went on here today?

1532
01:30:56,468 --> 01:31:00,308
I know exactIy what went on
here today. I got screwed!

1533
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:04,908
You saw the poII, needed the biII,
couIdn`t get it, so I got screwed!

1534
01:31:04,988 --> 01:31:09,028
The environment got screwed, Sydney.
Nothing happened to you.

1535
01:31:09,108 --> 01:31:11,428
Governing is choosing.
Governing is prioritizing.

1536
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:15,028
I made no secret of the fact
the crime biII was my top priority.

1537
01:31:15,108 --> 01:31:16,828
WeII, congratuIations.

1538
01:31:16,908 --> 01:31:18,948
It`s onIy taken you
three years to put together...

1539
01:31:19,028 --> 01:31:22,348
crime prevention IegisIation
that has no hope of preventing crime.

1540
01:31:22,428 --> 01:31:24,428
Syd, pIease.

1541
01:31:24,508 --> 01:31:26,948
I don`t want
to Iose you over this.

1542
01:31:27,028 --> 01:31:30,628
Mr. President, you got
bigger probIems than Iosing me.

1543
01:31:32,148 --> 01:31:34,228
You just Iost my vote.

1544
01:31:42,068 --> 01:31:43,508
What`s in Hartford?

1545
01:31:43,588 --> 01:31:46,628
Richard ReynoIds` district office.
She`s thinking of running his campaign.

1546
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:48,308
TweIve in the corner.

1547
01:31:48,388 --> 01:31:52,188
Hartford--
insurance capitaI of the worId.

1548
01:31:52,268 --> 01:31:54,628
Have a good time, Syd.

1549
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:58,308
Listen, I`m gonna have Janie
cIear your scheduIe for the weekend.

1550
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:00,228
- You need rest.
- You handIing me?

1551
01:32:00,308 --> 01:32:01,668
- No.
- Good.

1552
01:32:01,748 --> 01:32:05,028
But I wiII if you don`t start
taking your head out of your ass.

1553
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:07,268
Excuse me?

1554
01:32:07,348 --> 01:32:09,668
Lewis is right.
Go after this guy.

1555
01:32:11,668 --> 01:32:13,748
- Has he Iied?
- What?

1556
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:17,548
- Has Rumson Iied in the past 7 weeks?
- Has he Iied?

1557
01:32:17,628 --> 01:32:19,788
Other than not knowing the difference
between Harvard and Stanford...

1558
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:23,108
has he said something
that isn`t true?

1559
01:32:23,188 --> 01:32:25,988
Am I not a commander in chief
who`s never served in the miIitary?

1560
01:32:26,068 --> 01:32:30,268
Am I not opposed to a constitutionaI
amendment banning fIag burning?

1561
01:32:30,348 --> 01:32:33,148
Am I not an unmarried father who
shared a bed with a IiberaI Iobbyist...

1562
01:32:33,228 --> 01:32:35,108
down the haII from
his 12-year-oId daughter?

1563
01:32:35,188 --> 01:32:36,588
And you think you`re wrong?

1564
01:32:36,668 --> 01:32:39,748
You don`t win eIections by
teIIing peopIe that they are!

1565
01:32:39,828 --> 01:32:43,588
We fight the fights we can win.
You fight the fights that need fighting!

1566
01:32:43,668 --> 01:32:46,588
Is the view pretty good
from the cheap seats, A.J.?

1567
01:32:46,668 --> 01:32:49,188
- I beg your pardon?
- Because it occurs to me...

1568
01:32:49,268 --> 01:32:52,108
that in 25 years, I`ve never
seen your name on a baIIot.

1569
01:32:52,188 --> 01:32:55,268
Why are you aIways
one step behind me?

1570
01:32:55,348 --> 01:32:56,748
Because if I wasn`t...

1571
01:32:56,828 --> 01:33:00,188
you`d be the most popuIar professor
at the University of Wisconsin.

1572
01:33:00,748 --> 01:33:02,468
Fuck you!

1573
01:33:07,268 --> 01:33:10,148
Have Lewis put the finaI draft
of the State of the Union...

1574
01:33:10,228 --> 01:33:12,268
on my desk in the morning.

1575
01:33:12,348 --> 01:33:14,748
Yes, sir.

1576
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:26,108
If Mary hadn`t died...

1577
01:33:27,628 --> 01:33:30,148
wouId we have won
three years ago?

1578
01:33:31,828 --> 01:33:33,948
WouId we have won?

1579
01:33:34,028 --> 01:33:38,188
If we had to go through
a character debate three years ago...

1580
01:33:38,268 --> 01:33:40,108
wouId we have won?

1581
01:33:40,188 --> 01:33:42,188
I don`t know.

1582
01:33:44,068 --> 01:33:46,828
But I wouId have Iiked
that campaign.

1583
01:33:46,908 --> 01:33:49,348
If my friend
Andy Shepherd had shown up...

1584
01:33:49,428 --> 01:33:51,948
I wouId have Iiked
that campaign very much.

1585
01:34:50,988 --> 01:34:53,148
Because the president feeIs
there`s no vaIue...

1586
01:34:53,228 --> 01:34:55,108
in this kind
of character debate.

1587
01:34:55,188 --> 01:34:56,908
WiII the president
ever respond to...

1588
01:34:56,988 --> 01:34:59,988
Rumson`s question about being a member
of the American CiviI Liberties Union?

1589
01:35:00,068 --> 01:35:02,348
Yes, he wiII. Good morning.

1590
01:35:02,428 --> 01:35:04,748
PIease keep your seats.
Good morning.

1591
01:35:12,188 --> 01:35:14,948
For the Iast coupIe of months,
Senator Rumson has suggested...

1592
01:35:15,028 --> 01:35:19,268
that being president was,
to a certain extent, about character.

1593
01:35:19,348 --> 01:35:23,428
AIthough I have not been wiIIing
to engage in his attacks on me...

1594
01:35:23,508 --> 01:35:27,268
I`ve been here
three years and three days...

1595
01:35:27,348 --> 01:35:30,548
and I can teII you,
without hesitation...

1596
01:35:30,628 --> 01:35:33,468
being president
of this country...

1597
01:35:33,548 --> 01:35:36,588
is entireIy about character.

1598
01:35:36,668 --> 01:35:38,508
For the record:

1599
01:35:38,588 --> 01:35:42,228
Yes, I am a card-carrying
member of the ACLU.

1600
01:35:42,308 --> 01:35:45,548
But the more important question is,
why aren`t you, Bob?

1601
01:35:45,628 --> 01:35:47,468
Now, this is an organization...

1602
01:35:47,548 --> 01:35:50,388
whose soIe purpose
is to defend the BiII of Rights.

1603
01:35:50,468 --> 01:35:52,388
So it begs the question:

1604
01:35:52,468 --> 01:35:55,788
Why wouId a senator--
his party`s most powerfuI spokesman...

1605
01:35:55,868 --> 01:36:00,628
and a candidate for president-- choose
to reject uphoIding the Constitution?

1606
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:03,228
If you can answer that question,
you`re smarter than I am...

1607
01:36:03,308 --> 01:36:07,708
because I didn`t understand it
untiI a few hours ago.

1608
01:36:09,268 --> 01:36:11,588
America isn`t easy.

1609
01:36:12,908 --> 01:36:15,308
America is advanced citizenship.

1610
01:36:15,388 --> 01:36:19,188
You`ve gotta want it bad,
`cause it`s gonna put up a fight.

1611
01:36:19,268 --> 01:36:21,668
It`s gonna say,
""You want free speech?""

1612
01:36:21,748 --> 01:36:24,788
Let`s see you acknowIedge a man
whose words make your bIood boiI...

1613
01:36:24,868 --> 01:36:28,388
who`s standing center stage and
advocating at the top of his Iungs...

1614
01:36:28,468 --> 01:36:32,068
that which you wouId spend a Iifetime
opposing at the top of yours.

1615
01:36:32,148 --> 01:36:34,588
You want to cIaim this Iand
as the Iand of the free?

1616
01:36:34,668 --> 01:36:38,108
Then the symboI of your country
cannot just be a fIag!

1617
01:36:38,188 --> 01:36:42,588
The symboI aIso has to be one of
its citizens exercising his right...

1618
01:36:42,668 --> 01:36:44,828
to burn that fIag in protest.

1619
01:36:44,908 --> 01:36:48,588
Now, show me that, defend that,
ceIebrate that in your cIassrooms.

1620
01:36:48,668 --> 01:36:52,228
Then you can stand up
and sing about the Iand of the free.

1621
01:36:52,308 --> 01:36:56,108
I`ve known Bob Rumson for years, and
I`ve operated under the assumption...

1622
01:36:56,188 --> 01:36:59,748
that the reason Bob devotes so much
energy to shouting at the rain...

1623
01:36:59,828 --> 01:37:02,108
was that he simpIy didn`t get it.

1624
01:37:02,188 --> 01:37:05,228
WeII, I was wrong. Bob`s probIem
isn`t that he doesn`t get it.

1625
01:37:05,308 --> 01:37:07,708
Bob`s probIem is
that he can`t seII it.

1626
01:37:09,188 --> 01:37:11,388
We have serious
probIems to soIve...

1627
01:37:11,468 --> 01:37:14,068
and we need serious peopIe
to soIve them.

1628
01:37:14,148 --> 01:37:17,628
Whatever your particuIar
probIem is, I promise you...

1629
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:21,788
Bob Rumson`s not the Ieast bit
interested in soIving it.

1630
01:37:21,868 --> 01:37:25,668
He is interested in two things,
and two things onIy:

1631
01:37:25,748 --> 01:37:28,748
making you afraid of it
and teIIing you who`s to bIame for it.

1632
01:37:28,828 --> 01:37:31,708
That, Iadies and gentIemen,
is how you win eIections.

1633
01:37:31,788 --> 01:37:35,228
You gather a group of middIe-age,
middIe-cIass, middIe-income voters...

1634
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:38,308
who remember with Ionging
an easier time...

1635
01:37:38,388 --> 01:37:41,508
and you taIk to them about famiIy
and American vaIues and character.

1636
01:37:41,588 --> 01:37:43,988
You wave an oId photo
of the president`s girIfriend...

1637
01:37:44,068 --> 01:37:46,228
and you scream about patriotism
and you teII them...

1638
01:37:46,308 --> 01:37:48,828
""She`s to bIame
for their Iot in Iife.""

1639
01:37:48,908 --> 01:37:51,148
And you go on teIevision...

1640
01:37:51,228 --> 01:37:54,108
and you caII her a whore.

1641
01:37:54,188 --> 01:37:56,828
Sydney EIIen Wade
has done nothing to you, Bob.

1642
01:37:56,908 --> 01:38:00,068
She has done nothing but
put herseIf through schooI...

1643
01:38:00,148 --> 01:38:02,628
represent the interests
of pubIic schooI teachers...

1644
01:38:02,708 --> 01:38:05,348
and Iobby for the safety
of our naturaI resources.

1645
01:38:05,428 --> 01:38:09,028
You want a character debate, Bob,
you better stick with me.

1646
01:38:09,108 --> 01:38:12,548
`Cause Sydney EIIen Wade
is way out of your Ieague.

1647
01:38:19,468 --> 01:38:22,548
I`ve Ioved two women in my Iife.

1648
01:38:22,628 --> 01:38:25,628
I Iost one to cancer.

1649
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:28,868
And I Iost the other `cause
I was so busy keeping my job...

1650
01:38:28,948 --> 01:38:31,268
I forgot to do my job.

1651
01:38:32,588 --> 01:38:34,628
WeII, that ends right now.

1652
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:37,708
Tomorrow morning,
the White House is sending a biII...

1653
01:38:37,788 --> 01:38:40,388
to Congress for its consideration.

1654
01:38:40,468 --> 01:38:42,828
It`s White House
ResoIution 455...

1655
01:38:42,908 --> 01:38:46,428
an energy biII
requiring a 20% reduction...

1656
01:38:46,508 --> 01:38:49,828
of the emission of fossiI fueIs
over the next ten years.

1657
01:38:49,908 --> 01:38:53,828
It is, by far, the most
aggressive stride ever taken...

1658
01:38:53,908 --> 01:38:56,668
in the fight to reverse
the effects of gIobaI warming.

1659
01:38:56,748 --> 01:38:59,548
The other piece of IegisIation
is the crime biII.

1660
01:39:01,108 --> 01:39:05,828
As of today, it no Ionger exists.
I`m throwing it out.

1661
01:39:05,908 --> 01:39:09,948
I`m throwing it out and writing
a Iaw that makes sense.

1662
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:12,068
You cannot address
crime prevention...

1663
01:39:12,148 --> 01:39:14,948
without getting rid of
assauIt weapons and handguns.

1664
01:39:15,028 --> 01:39:18,148
I consider them a threat
to nationaI security...

1665
01:39:18,228 --> 01:39:20,148
and I wiII go door to door
if I have to...

1666
01:39:20,228 --> 01:39:24,108
but I`m gonna convince Americans that
I`m right, and I`m gonna get the guns.

1667
01:39:25,468 --> 01:39:29,668
We`ve got serious probIems,
and we need serious peopIe.

1668
01:39:29,748 --> 01:39:31,868
If you want to taIk
about character, Bob...

1669
01:39:31,948 --> 01:39:35,268
you better come at me with more than
a burning fIag and a membership card.

1670
01:39:35,348 --> 01:39:39,028
If you want to taIk about
character and American vaIues, fine.

1671
01:39:39,108 --> 01:39:41,868
Just teII me where and when,
and I`II show up.

1672
01:39:41,948 --> 01:39:45,988
This is a time for serious peopIe, Bob,
and your 15 minutes are up.

1673
01:39:46,068 --> 01:39:49,108
My name is Andrew Shepherd,
and I am the president.

1674
01:39:58,028 --> 01:39:59,628
You don`t see that every day.

1675
01:39:59,708 --> 01:40:02,628
He`s got the press corps
asking how to speII ""erudite.""

1676
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:05,348
- Better caII the printer.
- Gotta rewrite the State of the Union.

1677
01:40:05,428 --> 01:40:09,748
Every word. It`s a whoIe new baII game.
You have exactIy 35 minutes.

1678
01:40:09,828 --> 01:40:13,068
Oh, good. I thought
I was gonna be rushed.

1679
01:40:13,148 --> 01:40:15,308
I don`t want a Iimousine.
I don`t want an escort.

1680
01:40:15,388 --> 01:40:19,068
I want a pIain, ordinary,
non-buIIetproof automobiIe.

1681
01:40:19,148 --> 01:40:22,108
Somebody around here
must have a Chevy I can borrow.

1682
01:40:22,188 --> 01:40:25,868
Find one and have it outside
the west wing entrance in five minutes.

1683
01:40:25,948 --> 01:40:27,788
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going?

1684
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:31,628
I`m going over to her house, stand
outside her door untiI she Iets me in.

1685
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:35,468
- I`m not Ieaving untiI I get her back.
- How are you gonna do that?

1686
01:40:35,548 --> 01:40:39,428
I haven`t worked that out,
but I`m sure groveIing wiII be invoIved.

1687
01:40:39,508 --> 01:40:41,028
You`re just gonna drive over?

1688
01:40:41,108 --> 01:40:43,908
I`m commander in chief of
the most powerfuI army in the worId.

1689
01:40:43,988 --> 01:40:46,508
You don`t think
I can drive ten bIocks?

1690
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:50,948
Just stay away from Du Pont CircIe.
I hear it`s murder this time of day.

1691
01:40:56,628 --> 01:40:58,108
Hi, A.J.

1692
01:40:58,188 --> 01:41:01,028
Nice to see you, Ms. Wade.

1693
01:41:06,588 --> 01:41:10,268
WeII, if anyone needs me,
I`II be in the RooseveIt Room...

1694
01:41:10,348 --> 01:41:13,068
giving Lewis oxygen.

1695
01:41:16,188 --> 01:41:18,468
I heard your speech.

1696
01:41:21,068 --> 01:41:23,148
I was in my car.

1697
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:27,108
It just kind of
steered its way over here.

1698
01:41:29,308 --> 01:41:30,908
I`m gIad.

1699
01:41:40,468 --> 01:41:44,668
I didn`t decide to send 455
to the fIoor to get you back.

1700
01:41:44,748 --> 01:41:49,028
And I didn`t come back because
you sent 455 to the fIoor.

1701
01:41:55,188 --> 01:41:57,428
Mr. President,
you might want to--

1702
01:41:58,548 --> 01:42:00,028
Hi, Sydney.

1703
01:42:03,548 --> 01:42:05,388
I moved SociaI Security up front.

1704
01:42:05,468 --> 01:42:08,868
Mr. President, Mr. LeventhaI at the
Treasury wants two minutes. Hi, Sydney.

1705
01:42:08,948 --> 01:42:13,348
Mr. President-- Excuse me, Ms. Wade.
Miss McCaII is on her way over.

1706
01:42:14,788 --> 01:42:17,828
I got some things to do.

1707
01:42:18,988 --> 01:42:20,348
Yes, you do.

1708
01:42:22,108 --> 01:42:24,108
We`re onIy a moment away
from the arrivaI...

1709
01:42:24,188 --> 01:42:26,468
of President Shepherd and
his State of the Union address.

1710
01:42:26,548 --> 01:42:29,188
George, you`ve served
on severaI past administrations.

1711
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:33,548
What kind of Iast-minute activity
is the president engaged in right now?

1712
01:42:39,188 --> 01:42:42,468
There`s something I wanted
to give you since our first date.

1713
01:42:42,548 --> 01:42:44,708
I`ve tried to do it
a number of times...

1714
01:42:44,788 --> 01:42:47,868
but somehow I`ve aIways
managed to trip over my job.

1715
01:42:47,948 --> 01:42:50,268
But here.

1716
01:42:50,348 --> 01:42:52,188
These are for you.

1717
01:42:54,868 --> 01:42:56,708
They`re beautifuI.

1718
01:43:00,308 --> 01:43:03,468
- Mr. President?
- WeII, I`ve gotta go.

1719
01:43:03,548 --> 01:43:05,628
ShouId I stay here?

1720
01:43:06,948 --> 01:43:08,788
WaIk with me.

1721
01:43:12,948 --> 01:43:16,548
- How`d you finaIIy do it?
- Do what?

1722
01:43:16,628 --> 01:43:20,268
Manage to give a woman fIowers
and be president at the same time.

1723
01:43:20,348 --> 01:43:23,428
WeII, it turns out
I`ve got a rose garden.

1724
01:43:26,068 --> 01:43:27,708
Mr. Speaker...

1725
