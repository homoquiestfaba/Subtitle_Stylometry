1
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,015
- Oh, I can't believe it.

2
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,266
- Oh, rough morning?

3
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,334
- Hey.

4
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,335
Yeah, you could say that.

5
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,704
- Why, what's wrong?

6
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,006
- It's just something
I saw on the way over.

7
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,940
- Okay.

8
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,676
Hey, don't forget about tonight.

9
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:55,943
- Uh, tonight?

10
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:57,444
- Yeah, my brother's
birthday, remember?

11
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,412
- I forgot.

12
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,014
- Meet me there at seven.

13
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,248
You have the address, right?

14
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,151
- Yes, but, I'm
not really invited.

15
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,820
- Yes, you are. I invited you.

16
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,555
- Okay,
okay, I'll be there.

17
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,657
- You need some fun.

18
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,962
- Good morning.

19
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,396
Sorry I'm late, guys.

20
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,134
All right, if we could
please take our seats.

21
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:21,536
All right, girls I'm
gonna have you pass out

22
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,071
these folders and
we're all gonna take

23
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:25,573
a couple of notes
before we feed up.

24
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,809
- Notes? Do we have to?

25
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:28,843
- Just a few.

26
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,444
And then you can take care of

27
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,479
the animals both inside and out.

28
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,682
But first, we need to
get a little perspective

29
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:37,085
on what it might be like
to pursue your goals

30
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:37,885
of farm life.

31
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,121
Let's talk stats.

32
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,023
Now, did you guys know
that farming is one

33
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,491
of the most dangerous
occupations?

34
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:45,693
It's near the top of the list

35
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:50,031
with 25 deaths for
every 100,000 workers.

36
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,398
- Yeah, remember that
guy that fell off

37
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,333
the silo ladder last year?

38
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,702
It was like 10 miles from here.

39
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,838
- Yeah, I knew that guy

40
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:59,107
and it's not just the danger.

41
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,743
I mean every year of
farming is a crap shoot due

42
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,778
to weather, falling prices,

43
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,047
even government policies.

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,348
You could be in business
successfully for 10 years

45
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,085
and lost it all on your 11th.

46
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,587
- My uncle lost his farm.

47
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,821
Had to auction off everything.

48
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,422
Didn't get much back.

49
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,525
- And that is happening
more and more.

50
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,660
Banks foreclose,
developers move in

51
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:22,163
and pretty soon
there's no farms left.

52
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,765
Even if you work really hard,

53
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:25,066
'cause guys, you
have to understand

54
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,535
that farming,
especially dairy farming

55
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,103
is seven days a week.

56
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,639
There's no going to the
beach on the weekends.

57
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,875
- Yeah, Holly, forget
working on your tan.

58
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:35,475
- Except maybe a farmer's tan.

59
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,478
- All right, all right, guys.

60
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:39,714
That's enough.

61
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,849
It can be difficult to get into.

62
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:44,552
There's a saying that
you either marry the farm

63
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,621
or inherit it.

64
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,055
Did you know that
the average age of

65
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,323
the farmer is 58 years?

66
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,794
So, I do hope that some
of you guys will try it.

67
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:55,630
We can definitely use you.

68
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:58,266
- Thanks for the encouraging
words, Ms. Stafford.

69
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,935
- All right, now that's
enough for today.

70
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,203
Tomorrow we will talk about some

71
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,039
of the more positive
aspects of farming.

72
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,943
Now Caroline, Bella, if you
will feed the goats outside.

73
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,845
Riley, Alexis will take
care of the chickens.

74
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,280
Everyone one else
will feed up in here.

75
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,514
Thanks, guys.

76
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,512
- You made it.

77
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,445
I was worried.

78
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,215
- I told you I'd be here.

79
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:48,816
I just, I feel weird.

80
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:50,885
- Why?

81
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,153
- I don't know anybody.

82
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,590
- Well, you know me
and here's a run down

83
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,024
on the name characters.

84
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:59,227
So Mike, who's turning 28,

85
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,630
he's my brother, so naturally
I think he's a jerk,

86
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,665
but he's actually
a pretty nice guy.

87
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,969
And then there's
Matt, our older bro.

88
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,503
He's going through
a divorce right now,

89
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,839
so he's living with Mike.

90
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,274
As far as the other guests,

91
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,109
your guess is as good as mine.

92
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,477
I do know one thing.

93
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:22,216
Our parents are not invited,
so, okay, brace yourself.

94
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:23,184
- Okay.

95
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,554
- Have you ever thought
about living on your own?

96
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,855
- No, I have to be home

97
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,389
on the farm to help my family.

98
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,425
Looks really fun, though.

99
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:41,702
- Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug.

100
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,204
- Whoo!

101
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,006
- So, there's the birthday boy

102
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,407
and our older brother, Matt.

103
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,246
- Nice.

104
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,348
- Oh, he's not always like that.

105
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:55,516
- Check this out.

106
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,151
- He's really
stressed out at work

107
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,153
and, hey, it's his birthday.

108
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,421
Mike.

109
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,091
Mike.

110
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:04,926
Mike.

111
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,160
- What, what?

112
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:06,827
- Hey, I want
you to meet somebody.

113
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,062
- Who? Oh.

114
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,797
This is Jodi, Jodi Stafford.

115
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,032
- Hey.

116
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,300
- She lives out
on Stafford farm.

117
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,434
You know, on Limestone Road?

118
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,870
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,638
- She invited me
out there next week

120
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:20,174
to help out around the place.

121
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,376
- So you're gonna be on a farm?

122
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,844
What if your hair gets messed up

123
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,546
or if you break a nail.

124
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,915
I get it, you're
gonna go can some jam

125
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,251
and bake some whole wheat
bread, right?

126
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,553
And you're gonna teach her?

127
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,421
That's great.

128
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,323
- Hey, you know what?

129
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,524
I've got an idea.

130
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,260
How about you come
help out on the farm?

131
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,460
You think you can handle it?

132
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,762
- Me? No.

133
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,764
I eat Wonder Bread, right?

134
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:44,799
- Mike.

135
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:45,700
- Okay, fine, I'm sorry.

136
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,868
I, um, farming?

137
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,603
Yeah, that sounds different.

138
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,572
Um, yeah, why not,
I'm up for it.

139
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,707
What about tomorrow?

140
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,809
- Okay.

141
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,110
I'll pick you up at 5:30.

142
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:58,713
- AM?

143
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,015
- Yeah.

144
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,684
- Yeah, no problem.

145
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:06,220
- All right, well, I'll
see you at 5:30 then.

146
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,154
- Definitely.

147
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:08,923
Bright eyed and bushy tailed.

148
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:09,790
- Hope so.

149
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,227
Um, Lynn, I'm gonna head out.

150
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,929
I have an early
morning tomorrow.

151
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,431
- You just got here, though.

152
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:18,332
Okay, all right.

153
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:19,266
I'll walk you out.

154
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:21,936
You're gonna like her.

155
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,475
- All right, all
right, here we go.

156
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,976
Got a surprise.
- Round two.

157
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,745
- I got a surprise.

158
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,014
- All
right, here we go, ready?

159
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,315
- You're gonna like him.

160
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:37,018
- Right.

161
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:37,952
- Three-

162
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,053
- Two, one, go.

163
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,522
- Go, go, go.

164
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:45,860
- Whoo.

165
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:46,694
Come on.

166
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,517
- Mike?

167
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:13,788
Mike?

168
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:29,937
Mike?

169
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,209
Mike?

170
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:37,845
- Oh, what?

171
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,149
What?

172
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:42,983
- Hi.

173
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,186
It's Jodi.

174
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,988
I'm here to pick
you up, remember?

175
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,858
Remember Jodi from the party?

176
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:51,959
From the party?

177
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,463
- Oh.

178
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:56,330
The party.

179
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,467
That was a bad idea.

180
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,373
- Well, are you coming?

181
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,012
- Am I coming?

182
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:12,880
With you?

183
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,217
- Yeah, that's the idea.

184
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:27,394
So, today or?

185
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,468
- Sure.

186
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,276
Just, um, hey, if you
would just give me

187
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,912
like a second or like a minute.

188
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:47,915
That was a good party.

189
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,554
- I'll just wait here.

190
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:07,962
- Ready.

191
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,600
- Okay.

192
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:12,466
- Is something wrong?

193
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,371
- No.

194
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,839
No.

195
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:19,708
Not at all.

196
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:22,476
Let's go.

197
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,174
- I'm so sorry.

198
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,845
Do you mind just, uh, not
doing that so loud, please?

199
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,014
- Sorry.

200
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,483
How do you feel?

201
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,653
- Oh, fine, just fine, you know.

202
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:05,654
Good.

203
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:06,854
Ow!

204
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,556
Holy.

205
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,224
- I, I'm sorry.

206
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,326
Are you okay?

207
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,562
- Yeah, I'm good.

208
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:15,429
I'm fine.

209
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:19,701
Are we, uh, we here yet?

210
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:21,969
- We are there.

211
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,372
- Wow, this is nice.

212
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,141
- Thanks.

213
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,581
- Hi, guys.

214
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:46,427
All right.

215
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,133
Ready?

216
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,602
- Yeah.

217
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,638
Hey, wait, what
is that guy doing?

218
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:58,906
- Oh, that's my dad.

219
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,676
- That's your dad?

220
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,945
- Yeah, he's just getting the
chickens ready for market.

221
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,447
Come on, I'll show you.

222
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,281
- That's great.

223
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:11,452
That's great.

224
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:13,722
- Hey, Daddy.

225
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:16,558
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,159
- Daddy, this is Mike Jared.

227
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:19,993
Remember my friend, Lynn.

228
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,228
This is her brother.

229
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,296
- How do you do, sir?

230
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,400
- No use complaining.

231
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,401
- Right.

232
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:31,071
- Um, Mike came
to help out today.

233
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:34,676
- Oh, really?

234
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,945
Okay, Jodi.

235
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,614
Let's see how you
do today, Mike.

236
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,383
- Come on, I'll show you around.

237
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:45,553
- Wow. God.

238
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,491
Was your dad wearing like a
baseball mitt or something.

239
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:51,425
- What?

240
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,192
- Yeah, his hands, it felt like

241
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,160
it was like, uh-

242
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:53,994
- Leather.

243
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,530
- Yeah and-

244
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:56,831
- So big.

245
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:58,499
- I mean, yeah.

246
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,535
- Yeah, that's from 50
years of milking cows.

247
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,574
They just got like that.

248
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,441
- Oh.

249
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,283
Could you excuse me
for a minute, please.

250
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:39,339
- Next time, boy,
clench your teeth.

251
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:40,542
Save some of them big chunks.

252
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:41,408
- Daddy.

253
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,144
- Yes, sir.

254
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,012
Thank you, sir.

255
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,853
- Uh, do you want
some breakfast?

256
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:55,022
- No, no, hey, no,
thank you, no thanks.

257
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,693
Just, um, hey, you
go ahead, I'm good.

258
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:00,194
- That's okay.

259
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:04,031
Um, hey, you know what, maybe
I should just take you back.

260
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,232
Here, come on.

261
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,267
- Aw, man.

262
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,407
I'm, uh, I'm really
sorry about this.

263
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,308
- No, I'm sorry.

264
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:19,514
You weren't feeling well.
- I wasn't feeling well.

265
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:20,748
- Yeah.

266
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,917
- Um, maybe you can
come back another time.

267
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,087
- Maybe, yeah.

268
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,590
- When you're feeling better.

269
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:29,456
- Yeah.

270
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,363
- Wow.

271
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,198
Okay then.

272
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,804
Coming?

273
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,473
- Yeah.

274
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,013
Hmm.

275
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,357
- Hi, Mom.

276
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,559
- Hey.

277
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,493
- Where did you get him?

278
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,630
- I told you, Daddy,
he's Lynn's brother.

279
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:11,966
- And has that boy got a job?

280
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,267
- Yeah.

281
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,234
Yes, he does.

282
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,803
- What does he do?

283
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:16,771
- I haven't asked him yet,

284
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,405
but I think he makes good money.

285
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,576
- Won't last long around here.

286
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,945
- He wasn't feeling well.

287
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:25,379
- I could see that.

288
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,482
- He'll be all right.

289
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:48,803
- Nope.

290
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,307
- What's up, Mikey?

291
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,374
- Who wants to know?

292
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,476
- Ooh, touchy, aren't we?

293
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,425
- Why not?

294
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,742
- Jodi.

295
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:28,943
- What?

296
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:31,244
- You have a call,
you forgot your phone?

297
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,379
- Who is it?

298
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,748
- He says it's Mike.

299
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,718
He sounds very polite.

300
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,253
- Oh, uh, okay,
I'll be right there.

301
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,126
Thanks.

302
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,967
Hello?

303
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,234
- Hey, Jodi.

304
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,103
This is Mike.

305
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,972
- Who?

306
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:02,110
- The guy who lost
the big chunks this morning.

307
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,613
- Oh, right, how could I forget.

308
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:10,150
- Yeah, so, you know
to tell you the truth,

309
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,319
the strangest thing
just happened.

310
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,221
Yeah, I put on an
old pair of pants

311
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,758
and found a $50
bill in my pocket.

312
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,695
So, anyway, I was just thinking

313
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:23,865
that since I have
this extra $50 and all

314
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:27,602
that maybe, you know, you'd
like to help me spend it.

315
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,904
- Uh.

316
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:34,341
Well, I'd like to,
but the thing is

317
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,443
it's getting real busy
around here right now

318
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,412
and I'm working almost
every night unloading hay

319
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,881
and I just-

320
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,850
- Okay, yeah, no problem.

321
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,789
- Wait, um, how about
you save your $50 for now

322
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:50,591
and just come over again.

323
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,260
We could go riding or something.

324
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:55,563
- Riding?

325
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,533
You mean, like a horse?

326
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,101
- Yes, a horse.

327
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:02,503
I don't have a Harley.

328
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,810
- A horse , of course.

329
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:11,679
I've done that.

330
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:17,752
- Okay, um, how about tomorrow?

331
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
- 5:30 again?

332
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,158
- No, um, eight's fine.

333
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,394
- Oh, I'll be there.

334
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:31,431
- Oh, and I promise
no chickens this time.

335
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,136
- Thanks.

336
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,007
- All right, I'll see you then.

337
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,216
- Use the old $50
bill line on her?

338
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,886
- Yeah, but it didn't,
it didn't work.

339
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,292
- We'll see how long you last.

340
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,751
- What are you looking at?

341
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:24,819
- Not much.

342
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,759
- Hey, you made it.

343
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,995
- Yeah, at your service.

344
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:35,229
What are we gonna do first?

345
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:37,965
- Well, uh, we're just
about finished milking.

346
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:40,134
How about a guided tour
of the cow stables?

347
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,736
- I would like that.

348
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:42,603
- Come on.

349
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,572
It's right this way.

350
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:45,438
- Right.

351
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,355
- Here we are.

352
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,692
- Hey, you guys use machines?

353
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:06,260
- What do you mean?

354
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:08,996
- Well, you know, I
just wanna milk by hand.

355
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,165
- Uh, yeah, yeah,
we use machines.

356
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:15,002
And hey, guess what, we
have indoor plumbing, too.

357
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:15,970
- Really?

358
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:16,904
- Hey, Jodi.

359
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:20,473
Give me a hand with
this heifer, will you?

360
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:21,676
- I'll be right back.

361
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:22,610
Make yourself at home.

362
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,145
This is my brother, Frank,

363
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,080
and our hired hand,
Willie, guys, this is Mike,

364
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:27,480
I'll be right back.

365
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,884
- Hey.
- Hey.

366
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,591
- Hey, Mike, let me
show you something.

367
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:37,558
- Yeah, what's up?

368
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:38,993
- Have you ever seen the pattern

369
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,595
at the end of a
guy's teat before?

370
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:42,630
It looks just like a
star, it's fascinating.

371
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,131
- No, no, I can't say I have.

372
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:45,333
- Yeah,
yeah, yeah, look,

373
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,668
look right here, right here.

374
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:49,136
- Oh!

375
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,071
- Frank!

376
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,305
- It just came out.

377
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:52,940
I thought this cow was dry.

378
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:55,076
- No, no, it's cool, it's fine.

379
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,110
- You okay?

380
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:57,377
- Is there anything?

381
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,646
- Yeah, you'll be fine.

382
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,114
Um, sorry about that.

383
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,717
Come on, um, you can
help me pick up the eggs.

384
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,551
- Okay.

385
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,222
- See you later now, Mike.

386
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,223
- See you.

387
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:11,592
- Willie!

388
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,198
I'm sorry, don't
worry about them.

389
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,132
Come on, let's go.

390
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:32,747
- Get that one.

391
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,681
Just reach in.
- Right there.

392
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:35,716
- Yeah, just reach your hand in.

393
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,717
- Easy.

394
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:51,599
- Oh, yeah.

395
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:52,465
See this?

396
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:54,635
Come on, buddy.

397
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:57,505
He hates me.

398
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:03,177
- You wanna hold him?

399
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,879
- I would, yeah, let's do it.

400
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:07,281
Take, take, take it.

401
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,217
- There you go.

402
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,185
- You good?

403
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:11,986
Oh, God.

404
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:24,332
- Oh, really, that's amazing.

405
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:49,757
Hey, Willie?

406
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:51,659
Where's the restroom?

407
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:56,464
- Right over there
will work, huh?

408
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,032
- Yeah, man, it's fine.

409
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:58,899
- Okay.

410
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:11,579
Oh, man.

411
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:32,066
- Hey, where'd you go?

412
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,702
- Oh, just, you
know, looking around.

413
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:35,970
- Oh, well, you're
gonna ride Billy.

414
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:37,538
It's my dad's horse.

415
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:38,472
His trots a little bumpy,

416
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:39,508
but he's real quiet.

417
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:42,176
- That's great.

418
00:25:43,444 --> 00:25:44,612
Yeah.

419
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:46,414
- You have done
this before, right?

420
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:47,281
- Oh, yeah.

421
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:49,750
Yeah.

422
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,185
- All right, let's mount up.

423
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,454
- Mount up.

424
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,697
- Not bad, here, let
me give you a lift.

425
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,232
- Yeah, it's just that the
jeans are tight, you know.

426
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,400
- Yeah.

427
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,368
- Just give me a little-
- All right, one.

428
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,969
- Something.
- Two, three.

429
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:11,172
- Gah!

430
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:16,844
- What's wrong?

431
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:19,514
- Nothing, I'm just, you
know, a little tight.

432
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:21,215
It's been a little while.

433
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,950
- All right, let's get this.

434
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:25,686
Here.

435
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,254
And, reins.

436
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:28,989
- Yeah.

437
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:34,563
Wow, that was good.

438
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,831
- I've done it a few times.

439
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:37,998
Ready?

440
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:38,866
- Oh, yeah.

441
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,103
Go, go, go, go, go.

442
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:45,072
Come on.

443
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:47,241
Ah!

444
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,277
Don't wait up.

445
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:52,046
I'm good.

446
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:02,823
Ugh!

447
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,625
What the heck have
you been doing?

448
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:05,693
- Farming.

449
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:07,128
- No, no, don't sit on that.

450
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,997
Go get in the shower, man.

451
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,200
Oh, God.

452
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:16,303
God, Mikie, is she worth it?

453
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:24,579
- Yeah.

454
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:36,924
- Hey.

455
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,593
What are you doing here?

456
00:27:38,627 --> 00:27:41,095
- Well, I was just
checking out a property

457
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:43,497
and I'm driving by and
I thought I'd, you know,

458
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:46,734
stop by and see what
you do here all day.

459
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:48,269
- Too late. Day's over.

460
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,705
You're, um, visit
wouldn't have anything

461
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:54,775
to do with a fellow
teacher of mine, would it?

462
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:55,610
- What?

463
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:57,778
No.

464
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,814
- That's too bad 'cause
here she comes now.

465
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:05,587
- Hi.
- Hey, Jodi.

466
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,522
- What are you doing here?

467
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:10,024
- Oh, it's funny, I
asked the same question.

468
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:13,928
- Well, I was-

469
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:16,230
- Oh, he was just driving by.

470
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:21,468
Sorry.

471
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:24,471
I'm late for something.

472
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:28,209
Mike, why don't you
walk Jodi to her truck.

473
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:29,443
- Oh, yeah.

474
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,145
Um, yeah, it's no
problem at all.

475
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,949
- It's, you really
don't have to.

476
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:36,383
- It's fine.

477
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,785
I have so much time before
my next appointment.

478
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:42,591
- Okay.

479
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:51,498
Are you okay?

480
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,501
- I'm fine, couldn't be better.

481
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,538
- You sure you're okay.

482
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,239
- Absolutely.

483
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:12,019
- Not to be rude, but is it
for a doctor's appointment?

484
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,420
- Doctor?

485
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:15,823
Oh, no, no, this
is, it's for my job.

486
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:17,091
- Ah.

487
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,326
Well, uh, what time?

488
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,062
- Um, oh, geez, it
starts in five minutes.

489
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:24,064
- Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm keeping you.

490
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:25,132
You should go.

491
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:26,934
- No, it's, um, it's fine.

492
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:30,004
Will I see you around?

493
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:34,074
- Well, actually I was
wondering if you might want

494
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:35,610
to come over for dinner tonight?

495
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:36,678
If you're not busy.

496
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,113
- Well, why don't you take me up

497
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:40,948
on my offer to help
you spend my 50 bucks,

498
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:43,050
'cause, you know, that's
not gonna last forever.

499
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,386
- Okay.

500
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,388
How about a compromise?

501
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:50,157
I'll go out with
you if you come over

502
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,058
for dinner first.

503
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:55,162
- Will your parents be there?

504
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:56,698
- Yeah.

505
00:29:56,731 --> 00:30:00,367
- Just, I have a feeling
sometimes they don't like me.

506
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,737
- Look, they will.

507
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:04,271
It just takes them
a while to get used

508
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:05,806
to somebody new coming around.

509
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,676
You'll see.

510
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,379
Uh, 6 o'clock okay?

511
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:15,082
All right.

512
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:15,949
Don't be late.

513
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:37,237
Peas?

514
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,214
- I heard Walt
Crossen has to sell?

515
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:50,484
- I saw that comin'.

516
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:51,985
- Yeah, he didn't have
much of a crop this year

517
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,120
to begin with.

518
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:54,789
- And then the four-wheelers.

519
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:56,090
- Oh, hey, my brother
actually bought

520
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:57,592
a couple of really
nice four-wheelers

521
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,959
for my nephews.

522
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:00,260
Give them something to do,

523
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:02,062
hopefully keep those
guys out of trouble.

524
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:03,997
- Yeah, four wheelers.

525
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,400
Ruined half the man's
crop just playing around.

526
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:08,235
Little bastards.

527
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:11,105
- Oh.

528
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:13,974
- So, what does your
family do, Mike?

529
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,377
- Uh, my dad is a
partner in a law firm

530
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,847
and my mom's an
interior decorator.

531
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:19,980
- Oh, how nice?

532
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:21,882
What about you?

533
00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:23,350
Jodi says you have a good job?

534
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:24,952
- Yeah, he's an astronaut

535
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:26,420
and he's taking up space.

536
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:27,722
- Daddy.

537
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:32,126
- Um, I'm a real estate
marketing specialist

538
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,461
for a company called
Poole and Associates.

539
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,931
- Yeah, yeah, I've
heard of them.

540
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,166
They're the ones building all

541
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,869
those McMansions out
on Walker's Road.

542
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:43,137
That used to be good land

543
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,806
until the bank foreclosed.

544
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:48,810
- Mike, would you like
some more oysters?

545
00:31:48,843 --> 00:31:50,411
- Oh, it's oysters?

546
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:52,547
I didn't realize
these were oysters.

547
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,649
I've never seen
anything like this.

548
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:55,750
Is it like blue point?

549
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:58,419
- Mountain.
- Mountain?

550
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,254
- Mountain oysters.

551
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,758
You know the low hanging
fruit of the bull.

552
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:04,659
- Bob!

553
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:32,720
- Mm, I'm sorry.

554
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:40,762
- It's not funny.

555
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:41,995
- Stop.

556
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,698
- You know that'd
boy grow more if he

557
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:44,833
could keep some food down.

558
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:45,700
- Daddy!

559
00:32:58,245 --> 00:32:59,079
Why?

560
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:10,825
- Hi.

561
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:13,761
Just too much.

562
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:17,899
- Feeling better?

563
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:19,868
- I could definitely use a beer.

564
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:21,201
- Well, do you wanna go
to the Triple Nickel?

565
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:22,670
It's right up here.

566
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:24,639
It's a country place, though.

567
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:26,406
What?

568
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,374
- Do they have beer there?

569
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,276
- Yes, turn left up here.

570
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:41,121
- Well, hello there, Jodi.

571
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:41,890
- Hey.

572
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:42,857
- How's your daddy?

573
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:44,759
- He's fine, ornery as ever.

574
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,493
- Oh, yeah, I know
what you mean.

575
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:47,962
- Oh, Mr. Miller, this is Mike.

576
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:49,898
Mike, this is Mr. Miller
from the farm down the road.

577
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:50,732
- How do you do?

578
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:51,666
- I'm doing great.

579
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:53,100
Pleasure to meet you, Mike.

580
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:53,935
Enjoy.

581
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:54,769
- Have a good night.

582
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:55,770
- Thank you.

583
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:13,655
- I really am
sorry about dinner.

584
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:15,122
- Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's okay, really.

585
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:17,025
Just don't worry about it.

586
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,191
- I guess I just wasn't thinking

587
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,861
about what we were having.

588
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,163
- Well, the chicken
casserole was really good.

589
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:25,733
- Chicken?

590
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:27,735
- Yeah, it was in the bowl next-

591
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,604
- That wasn't chicken.

592
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:32,306
- No, no, no, no, you really,

593
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,142
you don't have to tell me.

594
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:36,010
- Okay.

595
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,016
- What can I get you?

596
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,955

- Oh, no.

617
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:33,661
- Aw!

618
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:35,362
Are you kidding me?

619
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:37,264
- I guess they were looking
for something to do.

620
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,533
- Something to do?

621
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:39,967
Something to do?

622
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,334
God, what am I supposed to do?

623
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,642
It's no problem.

624
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:51,512
Stay back.

625
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:52,412
- Mike!

626
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:53,514
Mike!

627
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,064
Mike, you're too
close to the ledge,

628
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:12,166
you'll never make it.

629
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,601
- Watch me.

630
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:25,445
Get in.

631
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:30,918
See you later,
suckers, yee ha! Whoo!

632
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:49,036
It's a nice view.

633
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,437
- Right.

634
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,304
I love it.

635
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,008
I could come up
here a million times

636
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,510
and never get tired of it.

637
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:59,747
- Oh, so you just park
here all the time, huh?

638
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:02,683
- No, but I ride
Dixie up here a lot.

639
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,553
- Yeah, you must
really love this place.

640
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:10,390
- It's the only place
I've ever known.

641
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:12,994
I grew up here and
so did my father

642
00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:14,796
and his father bought the land

643
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,165
when he was young and farmed it.

644
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:18,431
I guess it's in my blood.

645
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:23,504
- I, I don't get it.

646
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,573
- What?

647
00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:26,674
- Like why I'm here.

648
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:30,077
- Gee, thanks.

649
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:33,681
- No, I'm just, all
right, think about it.

650
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:35,683
The first time I come
over to your house

651
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,952
on some mad mission to
prove myself or whatever,

652
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,188
I tossed my cookies
in your yard.

653
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:43,291
Then, I come back and make
a complete idiot of myself.

654
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,526
Tonight, I completely
degrade myself

655
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,761
in front of your parents

656
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:47,695
and then I almost get
myself killed trying

657
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,429
to get this car off a ledge.

658
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:50,665
So, what?

659
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:51,833
Am I being tested
by God or something?

660
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,269
- Maybe.

661
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,641
- Or maybe there's some
kind of fatal attraction.

662
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:07,048
- Maybe that, too.

663
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,256
- Maybe I'm starting to realize

664
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:16,891
there's a lot more to
life than just making

665
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:19,060
my future millions
in real estate.

666
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:24,298
- I hope so.

667
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:28,035
Speaking of, I
really wish I'd known

668
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,037
your career path before tonight.

669
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,438
- Well, you didn't ask.

670
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,308
Like I never imagined it'd
be a problem, you know,

671
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:36,077
and I was gonna
tell you at school

672
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,345
and then I had to
rush off like that.

673
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:42,350
- No, I, I'm trying not
to let it be a problem.

674
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,918
It's just-

675
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:44,886
- I get it.

676
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:48,289
I do have a question, though.

677
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:51,826
- What's that?

678
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,527
- The second time
you ride a horse,

679
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,696
can you walk the next day?

680
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,001
- Sometimes.

681
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:06,908
The hayfield.

682
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:08,342
- What do you mean?

683
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:09,110
- Mike there's four
wheelers in the hayfield.

684
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,044
We gotta go.

685
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,411
- Okay.

686
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,957
- Hey, four wheelers.

687
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,525
Four wheelers in the field.

688
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:25,526
- No!

689
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,493
- Let's go.

690
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:29,830
Let's go, let's go.

691
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:30,665
- Hey, what should I do?

692
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:31,699
- Frank.

693
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,041
- Wait!

694
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:46,547
All right.

695
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:52,019
Oh, no, no.

696
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:05,099
All right.

697
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:12,139
Okay.

698
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:19,880
Hey, boy.

699
00:41:19,914 --> 00:41:20,715
Good boy.

700
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:21,849
You remember me?

701
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:26,520
Stupid mutt.

702
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:41,235
Okay.

703
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,840
- He, Duke, shute up.

704
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:46,707
- Oh, great.

705
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:48,676
Good evening, sir.

706
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:52,613
- What the hell are
you doing up there?

707
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:57,551
- I, uh, Jodi and I,
we were up on the hill

708
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:58,986
and then we saw-
- Oh, yeah.

709
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,922
- Yeah, no, I mean, no I mean,

710
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:03,924
we weren't doing anything.

711
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,394
I don't do, I would never
do anything, you know.

712
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:07,595
- Uh-huh.

713
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:09,563
- Oh, God, oh, man.

714
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:19,340
- Hey!

715
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:20,941
Bastards.

716
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:22,676
- The four wheelers,

717
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,911
they're in the field.

718
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,880
That's where we're going.

719
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:28,517
- You won't
shoot farm boy.

720
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,418
- Watch me, you son of a bitch.

721
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,055
- Dammit.

722
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:11,025
- Willie, you jackass.

723
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,231
- Get up, idiot.

724
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,332
- Willie, Willie.

725
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:22,770
- I planted that field.

726
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:23,604
- I know.

727
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:25,106
Take a walk.

728
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,941
- Oh, my God, look what you did.

729
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:29,310
- What are you
talking about, boy?

730
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:31,546
Did you see what
you did to my hay?

731
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,080
- Danny?

732
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:33,914
- Uncle Mike.

733
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:35,149
What are you doing here?

734
00:43:35,182 --> 00:43:36,951
- No, the question is
what are you doing here?

735
00:43:37,985 --> 00:43:40,020
- This is your nephew?

736
00:43:40,054 --> 00:43:41,222
Well, that figures.

737
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,559
Frank, go get the
John Deere with

738
00:43:44,593 --> 00:43:46,060
the loader and turn him over.

739
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:48,530
Get him out of here.

740
00:43:48,563 --> 00:43:51,265
Jodi, call the cops.

741
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,400
- The cops, for what?

742
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:54,869
- I'm filing charges.

743
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:56,538
Trespassing,
destruction of property

744
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:58,906
and whatever else
I can get you on.

745
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:00,474
- What about the
guy with the gun?

746
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:01,842
He shot at me.

747
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:03,477
I could get him for attempted
murder or something.

748
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:06,147
And what about the
damage to my ATV?

749
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,414
- You're pathetic.

750
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:08,115
- Hey, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait,

751
00:44:08,149 --> 00:44:08,983
just wait, okay.

752
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:12,386
Danny, you've caused way
more financial damage

753
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:13,921
to them than they did to you

754
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,689
and you get get
someone for defending

755
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:16,657
their own property.

756
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,327
Look, Mr. Stafford.

757
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:25,032
Look, somebody Danny
wants to go to law school.

758
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,568
All right?

759
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:28,402
And if he has a record, he
may not be able to get in.

760
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,139
You don't want him to
go to jail, do you?

761
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:35,309
- Hell, yeah.

762
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:36,177
- Okay.

763
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:38,279
I see your point.

764
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:40,147
But I promise that
I'll make sure

765
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:44,385
that nothing like this
ever happens again, okay?

766
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:46,020
Right, Danny?

767
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:47,188
- Yeah.

768
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:48,489
- Right, Danny?

769
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:50,525
- All right, sorry.

770
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,929
- Frank, tow him out of here.

771
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,532
We gotta milk in four hours.

772
00:44:57,566 --> 00:44:58,667
Let's get some sleep.

773
00:45:10,444 --> 00:45:12,547
Well, I just scored about

774
00:45:12,581 --> 00:45:14,381
a million more
points with your dad.

775
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:18,953
- You stood up to
him, he likes that.

776
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:20,788
- Oh, yeah, I can tell.

777
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:21,922
- No, trust me.

778
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:23,592
I know him.

779
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:31,966
- Come on, you two,
let's get outta here.

780
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:33,033
Come on, let's go.

781
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,512
Hey, boy.

782
00:45:44,546 --> 00:45:46,780
- Mike, Daddy, his name is Mike.

783
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:49,049
- Oh, yeah, excuse me, Mike.

784
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:51,118
Have you ever baled?

785
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,821
- Uh, baled?
- Yeah.

786
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:57,258
- Yes, sir, on a camping trip.

787
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,325
Yeah, the canoe sprung a leak

788
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:00,127
and so I was-

789
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,364
- Hey, he means
have you ever baled hay?

790
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:05,799
- Uh, no, um, no, sir.

791
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,001
I have not.

792
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:08,869
- Well, be here tomorrow.

793
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:10,538
Maybe you'll learn something.

794
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,873
- Tomorrow, yeah,
uh, is 6 a.m. okay?

795
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:18,412
- You don't bale
until afternoon when

796
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:20,447
the dew dries.

797
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:21,382
- Of course you don't.

798
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:22,651
- And, oh, I should warn you,

799
00:46:22,684 --> 00:46:25,786
we still bale the
old-fashioned way.

800
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:48,842
Grab it when it's ready.

801
00:46:48,876 --> 00:46:52,580
- I got you, is this, one sec.

802
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:55,550
- Don't be scared.

803
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:11,965
Oh, thanks, sorry.

804
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:14,968
You all right?

805
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,378
How are your hands?

806
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:26,246
- Oh, there's no blood yet, so.

807
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,788
- Daddy, why'd you stop?

808
00:47:34,955 --> 00:47:37,424
- Hey, boy, don't you
think I wore gloves

809
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,859
the first time I baled.

810
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:42,396
Kids.

811
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:43,397
- That's good.

812
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,167
- Okay.

813
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:52,306
- You'll thank him later.

814
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,310
- Oh, yeah, I will.

815
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:04,719
- Thanks.

816
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:09,323
- It's so easy.

817
00:48:09,356 --> 00:48:10,224
With the gloves.

818
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:11,959
- Told you.

819
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:16,930
- Good job.

820
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:18,198
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

821
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:26,106
- Hello, son.

822
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,643
- Dad, Dad, I'd like
you to meet Jodi.

823
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:29,577
Jodi Stafford.

824
00:48:30,444 --> 00:48:32,514
- Jodi, so nice to meet you.

825
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:34,314
I've heard so much about you.

826
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:35,282
- Nice to meet you, sir.

827
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:36,216
- Please sit down.

828
00:48:38,753 --> 00:48:42,456
You know, son, your
mom couldn't make it.

829
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:43,390
Problems with a client.

830
00:48:43,424 --> 00:48:44,925
You know how her job is.

831
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:48,429
- Sure, Dad.

832
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,263
- Hi, Mr. Jared.

833
00:48:49,296 --> 00:48:51,131
Can I offer you a drink?

834
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:52,099
- My usual please.

835
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:53,400
- How about you?

836
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:55,102
- Just a soda for me, please.

837
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:57,605
- All right, and
I'll do the same.

838
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,406
- Terrific, be back in a minute.

839
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:05,613
- So, Jodi, what do
you plan on doing

840
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,582
with your summer now
that school's out?

841
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,116
- Well, I'll be working at home.

842
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:10,518
We're still milking twice a day

843
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:11,786
and doing some baling.

844
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,689
Mike's gotten really
good handling a bale.

845
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:16,089
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

846
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:19,159
- Sounds like a wonderful life.

847
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:20,562
Farming.

848
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:21,796
You know, your mom's
been pestering me

849
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,164
about buying a piece
of land somewhere out

850
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:25,733
in the boondocks.

851
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:27,034
Says she wants to
be able to get away

852
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,368
from the working world.

853
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:29,470
I don't know.

854
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:33,307
- Will you excuse me
just for one minute?

855
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:38,479
- Seems like a nice girl.

856
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:40,380
- Dad, why?

857
00:49:41,683 --> 00:49:45,052
- By the way, I saw Jim
Poole the other day.

858
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:47,655
Real estate is
booming apparently.

859
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:49,557
It's uncanny how
this guy always seems

860
00:49:49,591 --> 00:49:51,191
to get the best deals.

861
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:53,962
Said he just bought a
piece of land for a song.

862
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,295
Were you in on that deal?

863
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,396
- No.

864
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,031
Not that one.

865
00:49:58,065 --> 00:49:59,199
- He's got a lot
of wonderful things

866
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:00,367
to say about you, son.

867
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,703
Says you'll really
rise up in this company

868
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:02,537
if you'll stick with it.

869
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,338
- Oh, yeah.

870
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,406
- You know I'm
proud of you, son.

871
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,510
I pulled a lot of
strings to get you there

872
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:09,944
and you haven't let me down.

873
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:12,814
- Uh-huh.

874
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:15,482
Uh, you know I've
actually been working

875
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:18,085
at the Stafford
farm in my time off.

876
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:18,953
- Mr. Stafford?

877
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:21,255
- Jodi's father.

878
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:23,390
He didn't like me much at first,

879
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:24,559
but I think I'm starting

880
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:25,492
to make a good
impression on him.

881
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:27,629
I'm really learning a lot.

882
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:29,363
- Learning
a lot about what?

883
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:30,999
Pitching manure?

884
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:31,866
- No.

885
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:33,835
Yeah, a little.

886
00:50:35,637 --> 00:50:36,704
I don't know, it's just,

887
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:38,138
after a day's work there,

888
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:40,942
you actually feel like you've
accomplished something.

889
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:42,442
- Accomplished?

890
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:44,612
Mike, when you're
working on developing

891
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:45,847
a piece of land,

892
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,982
watching those buildings rise,

893
00:50:48,016 --> 00:50:49,584
providing people with jobs,

894
00:50:49,617 --> 00:50:51,151
a decent place to shop,

895
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:54,054
I mean, that, that's
accomplishment.

896
00:50:55,023 --> 00:50:57,559
- Yeah, it's, I don't know.

897
00:50:57,592 --> 00:50:58,993
- Son, you gotta know
what I'm talking about.

898
00:50:59,027 --> 00:51:01,161
I mean, look at the
money you're making.

899
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:04,164
A whole lot more money than
I ever did at your age.

900
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:06,099
Look, I know you like
this girl and all, but-

901
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,067
- Jodi.

902
00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:09,571
Dad, her name is Jodi.

903
00:51:09,604 --> 00:51:10,538
- Whatever her name is.

904
00:51:10,572 --> 00:51:11,873
Just don't lose sight of where

905
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:13,575
your real responsibilities lie.

906
00:51:16,744 --> 00:51:19,547
At any rate, Jim's expecting
great things from you.

907
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:40,568
- Hey, it's George Moore.

908
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,537
Morning, George.

909
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,404
- Hey, Florence, how are you?

910
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,040
Bob.
- What brings you out?

911
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:47,274
- Well, nothing good.

912
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:48,977
- Come on, George, sit
down, have some pie.

913
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,678
- No, thank you, Florence, yeah.

914
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:52,714
- What do mean nothing good?

915
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:55,349
- Walter Patterson's
had an accident.

916
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:56,884
Must have had his
shirt cuff undone

917
00:51:56,918 --> 00:52:01,589
or something and got it
caught up in the PTO shaft.

918
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:03,423
Ripped his shirt clean off.

919
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:04,659
Caught his arm up in it, too.

920
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:06,226
Mangle it up pretty bad.

921
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:10,130
Doctor says he might not ever
have full use of it again.

922
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:12,567
- Oh, Lord, how's Ruth?

923
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,736
- Well, you know, she's
at the hospital with him.

924
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,104
She been there all day.

925
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,271
- Well, what are we gonna do?

926
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:19,507
- I don't know.

927
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,775
I figured we'd come up
with some kind of a plan

928
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:23,778
or a schedule, get in
his wheat and his hay,

929
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:24,946
get his milking done for him

930
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:27,247
and Clyde, Bill, Ted Dawson said

931
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,884
they'd pitch in and
lend a hand, too.

932
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:30,752
- We'll be there.

933
00:52:31,986 --> 00:52:32,854
- Thank you, Bob.

934
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:34,656
Boys.

935
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:38,926
Florence.

936
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,496
- See you, George.
- All right, George.

937
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,732
- Bob, how are you gonna do it?

938
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:47,535
You're so far behind yourself.

939
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:48,670
- Yeah, I know.

940
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:50,805
It's gotta be done.

941
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:52,707
I mean, they'd do
the same for us.

942
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,174
- I know they would.

943
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:56,209
- I can work overtime

944
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:57,444
and that extension agent

945
00:52:57,477 --> 00:52:58,646
from down state is
coming tomorrow.

946
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,714
He might help out.

947
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:03,350
And there's always
Jodi's boyfriend.

948
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:06,319
- Yeah, that boy's
trying, though.

949
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,287
- Yeah.

950
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,255
- She won't have a boyfriend

951
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:09,222
after her fancy lunch today.

952
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,390
She's probably dumping soup

953
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:11,592
in his dad's lap right now.

954
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:12,459
- Frank.

955
00:53:13,628 --> 00:53:15,630
- Well, come on, we got
work to do, let's go.

956
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:19,366
We'll see you later.

957
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:20,200
- Okay.

958
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:32,013
- Thanks.

959
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:42,990
Need a hand?

960
00:53:43,024 --> 00:53:44,025
- Oh, nah, I got it.

961
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:47,562
- Hey.

962
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:53,433
You don't put gas
in a diesel tractor.

963
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:57,004
- Something must have gone wrong

964
00:53:57,038 --> 00:53:58,172
with the equipment.

965
00:53:58,206 --> 00:54:00,508
That gets him madder
than anything.

966
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,009
- Can't blame him.

967
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:02,910
I'm the same way.

968
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:05,146
- Hey, why don't you set

969
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,413
your suitcases down
by the truck for now

970
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:08,448
and I'll take you
down to meet him.

971
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,350
Maybe that'll calm him down.

972
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:14,354
- Lucky I caught
that when I did.

973
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:15,923
Now, I gotta drain the tank

974
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:17,424
and hope that it starts okay.

975
00:54:20,293 --> 00:54:22,063
I mean the John Deere's
already broke down.

976
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:22,997
I don't have time
for this this week.

977
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,498
- Mr. Stafford, I'm so sorry,

978
00:54:24,532 --> 00:54:26,868
I just, I got into
the wrong tank and-

979
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:28,035
- Yeah, you sure did.

980
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:31,906
All right, now the front
loader's broke down.

981
00:54:33,074 --> 00:54:34,142
Now we're gonna have
to finish loading

982
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:35,209
the manure spreader by hand.

983
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:36,978
Do you think, do you think

984
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:38,780
that you can do that
without breaking something?

985
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:40,114
- Daddy.
- What?

986
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:44,484
- Daddy, this is Skip
Stevens, the extension agent.

987
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:45,720
- Glad to know you.

988
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:46,721
I'm sorry about
all the commotion.

989
00:54:57,397 --> 00:54:58,298
- This is my dad, Bob Stafford.

990
00:54:58,331 --> 00:55:00,001
This is my brother, Frank.

991
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:01,569
And, uh, Willie our hired hand.

992
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:04,304
- Gas instead of diesel fuel?

993
00:55:04,337 --> 00:55:05,506
- Yeah, dad gum it.

994
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:07,440
- Daddy, it's not his fault.

995
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:08,709
The tanks aren't even marked.

996
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:10,211
- Yeah, but lucky I
caught it when I did.

997
00:55:10,244 --> 00:55:11,846
If I would have
started the tractor,

998
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,346
it would have ruined the motor.

999
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,149
- You know, we had a hired
hand do the same thing once.

1000
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:16,851
I drained the tank then.

1001
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:17,952
I could do it for you now.

1002
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:19,187
Just let me change my clothes.

1003
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,320
- Nah, don't trouble yourself.

1004
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:21,289
You're our guest here.

1005
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:22,355
- No, I'm happy to do it.

1006
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:23,490
Just give me a minute.

1007
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:40,074
- It's really nice
of you to help out.

1008
00:55:40,107 --> 00:55:41,209
- Yeah, it's not a problem.

1009
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,615
Well, the sooner it
get done, you know,

1010
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:49,416
the sooner I can get to work.

1011
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:52,920
- Yeah, I know,
it'll be helpful.

1012
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:14,374
- That was a blessed
meal, darling.

1013
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:15,375
- Thank you, dear.

1014
00:56:16,944 --> 00:56:19,547
- Sure like what you
did with the tractor.

1015
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,682
Ran like a charm this afternoon.

1016
00:56:21,716 --> 00:56:22,617
- Well, while I was in there,

1017
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,818
I changed the fuel filter.

1018
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:26,020
I like fooling
around with engines.

1019
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:27,221
- Skip's actually speaking at

1020
00:56:27,255 --> 00:56:28,689
the local ag conference tomorrow

1021
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:30,324
with a couple of other speakers.

1022
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:32,293
- Oh, yeah, who else?

1023
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:35,495
- Kelly Grant from upstate.

1024
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:36,964
He's talking about
manure management.

1025
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:38,199
- Yeah, I know him.

1026
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:40,635
He stayed with us
last year, nice guy.

1027
00:56:40,668 --> 00:56:42,536
Jodi had a big crush on
him, didn't you, Jodi?

1028
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:43,905
- Shut up, Frank.

1029
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:47,074
- So what's your topic, Skip?

1030
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:50,378
- One of my sessions is
on pasture management

1031
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,179
and poisonous weeds.

1032
00:56:52,213 --> 00:56:53,681
- That sounds fascinating.

1033
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:55,850
What about your
other session, Skip?

1034
00:56:55,883 --> 00:56:58,686
- I'll be discussing
the future of farming,

1035
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,088
trying to motivate
young farmers and others

1036
00:57:01,122 --> 00:57:03,925
to pursue agricultural
careers in tough times,

1037
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:07,528
the importance of
farming in today's world

1038
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:10,531
and how everyone can make
an impact on the future.

1039
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:12,900
- Well.

1040
00:57:12,934 --> 00:57:14,135
- Oh.

1041
00:57:14,168 --> 00:57:15,336
- Well, we sure need
someone promoting

1042
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,738
the farm way of life.

1043
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:19,540
People getting too
far away from it

1044
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:21,075
and you can't
understand something

1045
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,610
that you're too far away from.

1046
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:27,081
- Well, thank you so much
for dinner, Mrs. Stafford.

1047
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,015
It was really good,

1048
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:30,284
but Jodi and I better get going.

1049
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:31,419
Moving starts in half an hour.

1050
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:32,887
- Oh, that's right.

1051
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,722
- Oh, wait, Jodi, I thought
you and Mike were going

1052
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:36,691
to stay and watch
Skip's presentation

1053
00:57:36,724 --> 00:57:39,427
of the ag delegation
trip to Japan?

1054
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:41,195
- Oh, well.

1055
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:43,831
- I always like a presentation.

1056
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:44,765
Like a PowerPoint?

1057
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:47,601
- Well, I would like to see it,

1058
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:49,036
but let's go to the movies.

1059
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,470
I can see it some
other time, right?

1060
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:52,573
- But he'll only
be here two weeks

1061
00:57:52,606 --> 00:57:54,709
and, you know,
he's gonna be busy.

1062
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:04,885
- Hey, you just stay.

1063
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:05,820
I'll go home.

1064
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:06,854
I've got some work to do.

1065
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:07,788
- No, no, no, no.

1066
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:08,723
- Yes, it's fine.

1067
00:58:08,756 --> 00:58:09,957
I'll call you later.

1068
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:12,793
Thanks again, Mrs. Stafford.

1069
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:13,694
- You're welcome.

1070
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:23,537
- Hey, Mike.

1071
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:37,118
Who wants dessert?

1072
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:45,559
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1073
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:53,167
- Hello?

1074
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,035
Mike, hi.

1075
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:57,071
Oh, today?

1076
00:58:58,272 --> 00:59:01,175
It's, yeah, well, Frank
and I were gonna go down

1077
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,376
to the conference center

1078
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,246
to hear Skip speak, but
I'll be home by six.

1079
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,315
Oh. Okay.

1080
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:10,551
Call me tomorrow?

1081
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:13,487
Oh.

1082
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:18,426
Well, I'll talk
to you soon then?

1083
00:59:19,627 --> 00:59:20,728
Are you sure?

1084
00:59:23,097 --> 00:59:24,565
Okay.

1085
00:59:24,598 --> 00:59:26,167
All right.

1086
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,334
Bye.

1087
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:50,024
- Morning.
- Morning.

1088
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:52,927
- Nice horse.
- Thanks.

1089
00:59:54,361 --> 00:59:56,330
- You sure it's all right me
borrowing the truck this week?

1090
00:59:56,363 --> 00:59:57,364
I could just rent a car.

1091
00:59:57,398 --> 00:59:58,599
- Oh, no, it's fine.

1092
00:59:58,632 --> 00:59:59,568
I don't need it
when school's out.

1093
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,035
- Oh, thanks.

1094
01:00:01,068 --> 01:00:04,004
I'll have to thin of
some way to repay you.

1095
01:00:04,038 --> 01:00:05,039
- That's okay.

1096
01:00:05,072 --> 01:00:06,941
Uh, I'll see you this afternoon?

1097
01:00:06,974 --> 01:00:08,375
- Yeah.

1098
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:10,111
I'll be back to pick
y'all up around 1 o'clock?

1099
01:00:10,144 --> 01:00:11,378
- Sounds great.

1100
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:12,213
See ya.

1101
01:01:31,025 --> 01:01:31,892
Frank!

1102
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:57,117
Go home, girl.

1103
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:58,520
Frank, Frank, oh.

1104
01:01:59,453 --> 01:02:00,254
Frank.

1105
01:02:06,961 --> 01:02:07,761
Okay.

1106
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:15,670
Oh, God.

1107
01:02:15,704 --> 01:02:17,071
Frank.

1108
01:02:17,104 --> 01:02:19,306
No, hang in there, Frank.

1109
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,775
Help will be here real soon.

1110
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:22,810
Please, God.

1111
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:29,750
Help!

1112
01:02:36,357 --> 01:02:37,191
Help!

1113
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:50,237
- Bob!

1114
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:53,307
- That rope.
- Bob!

1115
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,378
- Come on, let's go.

1116
01:03:04,552 --> 01:03:06,420
- Paging Dr. Bender.

1117
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:07,921
Paging Dr. Bender.

1118
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:19,567
- He's going to be fine.

1119
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:22,737
His nose is broken,
but we can fix that.

1120
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:24,773
And he does have a concussion,

1121
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:26,675
so he'll have to take it easy.

1122
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:30,377
You can see him now
if you want to go in.

1123
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:31,812
Just the parents at first.

1124
01:03:31,845 --> 01:03:35,282
We don't to overwhelm him.

1125
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,221
- Thank God.

1126
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,424
- You know he wouldn't
have made it at all

1127
01:03:43,457 --> 01:03:44,726
if you hadn't been there.

1128
01:03:45,627 --> 01:03:47,494
If he'd fallen off the tractor.

1129
01:03:47,529 --> 01:03:48,862
- Don't, don't even say it.

1130
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:53,267
- I wonder how the rock got
in there in the first place.

1131
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,202
- I know how it got in there.

1132
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:00,107
- Willie, it wasn't
anyone's fault.

1133
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,409
- I'm sure that's true.

1134
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:03,911
- Yeah, right.

1135
01:04:03,944 --> 01:04:05,312
- What'd you say?

1136
01:04:05,346 --> 01:04:06,146
- Mike.

1137
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:10,217
Maybe you should just go home.

1138
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:18,526
Mike, wait.

1139
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:30,805
Mike.

1140
01:04:31,673 --> 01:04:33,107
Mike, where are you going?

1141
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,108
- Where am I going?

1142
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:36,176
I'm going home.

1143
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,411
Isn't that where
you told me to go?

1144
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:38,245
Yeah, that's the
best place for me.

1145
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:39,480
- Just wait.

1146
01:04:39,514 --> 01:04:40,414
- No, don't worry about it

1147
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,049
because this is my fault.

1148
01:04:42,082 --> 01:04:43,685
It's my fault for
thinking that any

1149
01:04:43,718 --> 01:04:45,486
of this was gonna work out.

1150
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,421
God, I've been working
my butt off trying

1151
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:48,455
to impress you and your family.

1152
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:49,390
- You have.

1153
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:50,625
- And, sure, look at this.

1154
01:04:52,259 --> 01:04:54,361
This accident was
probably my fault.

1155
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,600
How do you think
that makes me feel.

1156
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:01,736
And then you, I really
started to think

1157
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:03,437
that there may be
something here.

1158
01:05:04,739 --> 01:05:05,939
And then mister ag
extension shows up

1159
01:05:05,973 --> 01:05:07,441
and you act like
I'm not even there

1160
01:05:07,474 --> 01:05:10,244
and then you just, just a
second ago you sounded like

1161
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:12,647
you were sending me to
my room for being bad.

1162
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,515
I mean...

1163
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:19,987
Look, I'm, I'm
sorry, you're right.

1164
01:05:22,824 --> 01:05:23,825
I don't belong here.

1165
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,762
My dad was right.

1166
01:05:27,796 --> 01:05:28,730
It's time that I started

1167
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:30,497
to focus on my real job.

1168
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,536
So if you could just tell Frank

1169
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:36,136
that I'm sorry.

1170
01:05:37,872 --> 01:05:39,206
I've gotta go.

1171
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:41,008
- Mike.

1172
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:41,876
Mike.

1173
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:03,063
- Hey, back from the hospital?

1174
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:04,465
- Yep.

1175
01:06:04,498 --> 01:06:05,466
- How is he?

1176
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:08,770
- He's gonna be fine.

1177
01:06:08,803 --> 01:06:09,604
- Yeah?

1178
01:06:10,672 --> 01:06:12,039
- Yeah.

1179
01:06:12,072 --> 01:06:13,307
- How are you?

1180
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,174
- Me?

1181
01:06:17,545 --> 01:06:18,780
I'm just fantastic.

1182
01:06:20,013 --> 01:06:20,849
- Okay.

1183
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:25,486
By the way, your boss called.

1184
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:28,055
- What did he want?

1185
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:29,490
- To say he's got some
new project he wants

1186
01:06:29,524 --> 01:06:30,658
you to work on.

1187
01:06:32,092 --> 01:06:33,962
He said it can wait until
he sees you tomorrow.

1188
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:37,364
- That's great.

1189
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,235
I'm gonna hit the hay.

1190
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:43,103
- Is that a newly
learned farm expression?

1191
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:44,438
- That's very funny.

1192
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:45,573
- Hey, Mike.

1193
01:06:45,607 --> 01:06:46,406
- Yeah.

1194
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:49,009
- It never would
have worked out.

1195
01:07:30,685 --> 01:07:31,519
- Jodi.

1196
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:34,656
Jodi.

1197
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:35,890
- What, Dad?

1198
01:07:35,924 --> 01:07:37,224
- I think it's clean.

1199
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,408
- Oh, man.

1200
01:10:17,618 --> 01:10:18,619
- All right.

1201
01:10:19,721 --> 01:10:20,621
I'm comin'.

1202
01:10:21,756 --> 01:10:22,657
I'm comin'.

1203
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:27,829
- Hello?

1204
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:28,696
- Yep.

1205
01:10:29,997 --> 01:10:30,832
- Hey, Willie.

1206
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:35,169
- She's not here.

1207
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:39,574
Well, she must have
forgot her cell phone.

1208
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:44,478
No, she went out this morning.

1209
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:47,380
I don't know where she went.

1210
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:50,250
No, Skip took her.

1211
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,154
A while ago.

1212
01:10:57,892 --> 01:10:59,127
Yeah, I'll tell her.

1213
01:11:41,769 --> 01:11:43,604
- Michael, come right in.

1214
01:11:43,638 --> 01:11:44,539
- How you doin', sir?

1215
01:11:44,572 --> 01:11:45,940
- Good to see you. Take a seat.

1216
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:48,876
Look, I just wanted
to touch base

1217
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,545
and run something by you.

1218
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:52,146
I haven't talked to you lately.

1219
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,015
You've been a little distracted.

1220
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:57,285
- I'm sorry, I was,
uh, it's not important.

1221
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,920
I'm back with you now.

1222
01:11:58,953 --> 01:12:00,154
- Great, great.

1223
01:12:00,188 --> 01:12:01,789
So, uh, we've been
starting some research

1224
01:12:01,823 --> 01:12:02,957
on some available properties

1225
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,959
for transformational
development,

1226
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,594
first one in the area.

1227
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:09,263
- I did my master's thesis
on transformationals.

1228
01:12:10,363 --> 01:12:11,666
- I'm aware of that.

1229
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:12,800
That's why I wanted you on this

1230
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:14,401
from the ground floor up.

1231
01:12:14,434 --> 01:12:16,336
See, I need your
knowledge on how

1232
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:18,272
these projects have
worked in the past

1233
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:21,441
and also your research
and computer skills

1234
01:12:21,474 --> 01:12:23,410
as far as crunching the data

1235
01:12:23,443 --> 01:12:25,445
and finding the best
property for it.

1236
01:12:25,478 --> 01:12:28,716
So, sound like something
you'd be interested in?

1237
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:29,984
- Absolutely.

1238
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,152
I'm your man, I'll
get started today.

1239
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:31,986
- Perfect.

1240
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:33,254
Okay, great.

1241
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:35,523
See, thing is, though,
we're a little rushed,

1242
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:38,192
so if you could put
something together,

1243
01:12:38,226 --> 01:12:40,328
have it ready for
us early next week.

1244
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,696
- I'll do my best.

1245
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:43,297
- Excellent. Thank you so much.

1246
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:49,270
You're my guy.

1247
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:55,343
- These heifers
I'm about to show you

1248
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,277
are gonna save us.

1249
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:57,477
- Oh, yeah, how's that?

1250
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:58,913
- Well, Mom started
arguing with Dad

1251
01:12:58,946 --> 01:13:00,748
about a year ago
about selling out.

1252
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:02,617
Says she can't pay
the bills anymore.

1253
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:04,285
Dad can hardly stand
to talk about it

1254
01:13:04,318 --> 01:13:06,520
because the farm has been
in the family for so long,

1255
01:13:06,554 --> 01:13:09,090
so we made an investment
in artificial insemination

1256
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:10,358
from the best bulls.

1257
01:13:11,259 --> 01:13:12,159
When these heifers calf,

1258
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:13,327
they should raise the herd

1259
01:13:13,361 --> 01:13:15,830
from 30,000 to
35,000 pounds easy.

1260
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:18,465
And raise butter fat
from 3.5 to 3.9%.

1261
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:19,800
- Yeah, I've seen it happen.

1262
01:13:19,834 --> 01:13:21,636
- These heifers
are beautiful, too.

1263
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:24,205
The vet should be here any
minute to vaccinate them.

1264
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:25,072
What the hell?

1265
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,275
- Frank?

1266
01:13:27,308 --> 01:13:28,976
Frank, what's the
matter with them?

1267
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,912
- How the hell should I know?

1268
01:13:30,945 --> 01:13:32,780
- Almost looks like
they've been poisoned.

1269
01:13:32,813 --> 01:13:33,881
- Poisoned.

1270
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:35,082
- Here comes the vet.

1271
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:36,183
Thank God I called her today.

1272
01:13:36,217 --> 01:13:37,551
- What's happened here?

1273
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:38,819
- I don't know.

1274
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:40,321
We were just coming
out to look 'em over

1275
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:41,222
and wait for you.

1276
01:13:42,523 --> 01:13:43,423
They were fine yesterday,
they were fine.

1277
01:13:43,456 --> 01:13:44,926
- Take it easy, Frank.

1278
01:13:57,939 --> 01:14:00,675
I'm going to have to put
her down and get inside.

1279
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:02,176
- Why.

1280
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:04,745
It's obvious they've got
a hold of something toxic.

1281
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:06,446
Have you changed feeds lately?

1282
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:08,816
- No, they've been
eating the same hay

1283
01:14:08,849 --> 01:14:10,918
and say grain since
they've been out here.

1284
01:14:10,952 --> 01:14:12,186
- Jodi, can you walk the field

1285
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:14,021
to see if there's
anything unusual?

1286
01:14:14,055 --> 01:14:15,556
- Sure.
- I'll come with you.

1287
01:14:17,992 --> 01:14:19,660
- I don't get it.

1288
01:14:19,694 --> 01:14:21,529
I can't lose these heifers.

1289
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:23,463
- This will cause death
almost before I pull

1290
01:14:23,496 --> 01:14:24,332
the needle out.

1291
01:14:25,498 --> 01:14:27,168
- Are you sure you
have to do that?

1292
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:29,303
- I've got to examine
the stomach contents

1293
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:31,906
if you want me to try
and save any of them.

1294
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:33,207
- Frank!

1295
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,041
Frank!

1296
01:14:34,075 --> 01:14:35,009
- What the hell?

1297
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:36,043
- I found these.

1298
01:14:36,077 --> 01:14:37,244
They were thrown over the fence

1299
01:14:37,278 --> 01:14:38,446
at the far gate by the road.

1300
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:40,114
There's a whole pile
of them scattered about

1301
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,415
like the cows have
been into them.

1302
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:44,986
- Yew bushes,
poisonous to cattle.

1303
01:14:45,019 --> 01:14:46,486
I'm sorry, Frank.

1304
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,689
I can only help the ones
that aren't too far gone.

1305
01:14:48,723 --> 01:14:50,791
- How did they get out here?

1306
01:14:50,825 --> 01:14:52,793
- I don't know.

1307
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:54,829
- I bet I know how
they got there.

1308
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:57,098
It's the four-wheelers
getting revenge.

1309
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:58,332
And your ex-boyfriend.

1310
01:14:58,366 --> 01:14:59,300
I bet he's pretty pissed
off at you, ain't he?

1311
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:00,868
- No, no, he wouldn't do this.

1312
01:15:00,901 --> 01:15:02,069
- Wouldn't he?

1313
01:15:02,103 --> 01:15:03,604
I bet your ass I
can prove it to you.

1314
01:15:03,637 --> 01:15:04,472
- Willie!

1315
01:15:10,745 --> 01:15:12,013
- That's the end of it.

1316
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:14,181
- I'll get started
examining the others.

1317
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:16,584
I can't promise anything.

1318
01:15:31,098 --> 01:15:33,200
- There you are.

1319
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:34,201
- Dad said you're
pretty much running

1320
01:15:34,235 --> 01:15:35,236
the company now.

1321
01:15:35,269 --> 01:15:37,905
- Uh, yeah, not exactly.

1322
01:15:37,938 --> 01:15:39,573
- What do you do there?

1323
01:15:39,607 --> 01:15:40,875
- Marketing research.

1324
01:15:40,908 --> 01:15:42,910
So I tell companies
where to build,

1325
01:15:42,943 --> 01:15:44,645
where they can find
land dirt cheap

1326
01:15:44,678 --> 01:15:46,313
and they can make
millions on it.

1327
01:15:47,448 --> 01:15:49,083
- How much do you make?

1328
01:15:49,116 --> 01:15:50,684
- It's none of your business.

1329
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:54,155
- Well, I mean, at least
enough to pay for our lunch.

1330
01:15:54,188 --> 01:15:55,022
- Sure, Danny.

1331
01:15:55,856 --> 01:15:57,058
- Hey.

1332
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:58,859
- Uh-oh, here
comes the hillbilly.

1333
01:15:58,893 --> 01:16:00,127
- Hey, Willie.

1334
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:02,296
Is there something
I can help you with?

1335
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:03,397
- I should have known
you'd be here, too,

1336
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:04,899
you son of a bitch.

1337
01:16:04,932 --> 01:16:06,133
- Hey, what's the
matter with you, man?

1338
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:07,601
- You know what's
the matter with me.

1339
01:16:07,635 --> 01:16:08,836
You probably planned
the whole thing.

1340
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:10,304
- What the hell are
you talking about?

1341
01:16:10,337 --> 01:16:11,238
- Quit playing stupid.

1342
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:12,873
I'm talking about the heifers.

1343
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:14,075
- The heifers.

1344
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:17,311
- Yeah, the heifers, asshole.

1345
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:19,480
The ones you poisoned.

1346
01:16:19,514 --> 01:16:21,315
The ones laying
dead in the field.

1347
01:16:21,348 --> 01:16:23,250
- You little-
- Shut up, Danny.

1348
01:16:23,284 --> 01:16:26,053
Just, Willie, just
tell me what happened.

1349
01:16:26,087 --> 01:16:27,988
- Just one you planned on.

1350
01:16:28,022 --> 01:16:30,458
They ate the yew bushes
you dumped in the field.

1351
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:31,892
- Oh, yeah, that was us.

1352
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:33,562
Like we got nothing better to do

1353
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,564
than to poison some dumb cows.

1354
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:38,499
I ain't even never heard
of a yew bush before.

1355
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:40,401
- I hope you're happy,
you son of a bitch.

1356
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:41,635
Them heifers ain't
even good enough

1357
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:43,037
for making into
a dead hamburger.

1358
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:45,840
- Come on, come on,
Willie, not here.

1359
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:50,177
- You're disturbing
the peace, boy.

1360
01:16:50,211 --> 01:16:51,946
Get out of my restaurant.

1361
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:53,047
I'm gonna call the cops.

1362
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,482
- I'm going.

1363
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:55,649
- Damn right you are.

1364
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:58,520
- What a jerk.

1365
01:16:58,553 --> 01:17:00,688
- Shut up, Danny.

1366
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:02,256
I swear, if I find out
you guys had anything

1367
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:03,190
to do with this.

1368
01:17:03,224 --> 01:17:04,391
- We didn't Uncle Mike.

1369
01:17:04,425 --> 01:17:05,560
- You think we would
do something like that?

1370
01:17:05,594 --> 01:17:07,661
I know we wheeled the guys farm,

1371
01:17:07,695 --> 01:17:09,964
but I'm not into
killing dumb animals.

1372
01:17:11,332 --> 01:17:12,366
- Would you sit down?

1373
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,304
Sorry.

1374
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:30,519
- Yeah, I'm going, in
just a couple minutes.

1375
01:17:44,732 --> 01:17:46,834
I needed some body
work done anyway.

1376
01:17:52,706 --> 01:17:53,542
No!

1377
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,711
Stop, stop, I just had it fixed.

1378
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:03,350
- No, no, no, no, hey, whoa.

1379
01:18:03,384 --> 01:18:04,218
Whoa, no.

1380
01:18:05,554 --> 01:18:07,354
Whoa, whoa, hey!

1381
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:10,991
Hey, come on, open
the door, let's talk.

1382
01:18:11,025 --> 01:18:13,894
Let's talk, man, come on,
just, just open it, come on.

1383
01:18:13,928 --> 01:18:15,062
Willie.

1384
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:16,830
Willie, wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa, no.

1385
01:18:17,798 --> 01:18:18,633
Don't make this any worse, man.

1386
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:19,501
Come on.

1387
01:18:22,136 --> 01:18:24,038
Just, hold on.

1388
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:25,306
- Back up, back up, back up.

1389
01:18:25,339 --> 01:18:26,473
Out of the truck.

1390
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:28,142
Out of the truck.

1391
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:30,044
Turn around real
slow, real slow.

1392
01:18:30,077 --> 01:18:32,413
Hands behind your
back, slow, slow, slow.

1393
01:18:33,814 --> 01:18:34,649
Don't move.

1394
01:18:36,016 --> 01:18:37,017
All right, let's go.

1395
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,654
Let's go, come on.

1396
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:45,793
Get in the truck.

1397
01:18:54,502 --> 01:18:55,970
- You're gonna pay for this.

1398
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:57,238
You're gonna have
more than dead cows

1399
01:18:57,271 --> 01:18:58,540
to worry about next time.

1400
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:01,842
- Shut up.

1401
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:04,512
Just shut up, Danny.

1402
01:19:06,814 --> 01:19:08,382
- I just had it fixed.

1403
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:16,991
- It just won't work, Dad.

1404
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:17,858
- Why not?

1405
01:19:19,093 --> 01:19:20,828
- Those heifers
were our only chance

1406
01:19:20,861 --> 01:19:22,997
to pull ourselves
out of this hole.

1407
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:24,898
Now, we can't even
get ourselves out

1408
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,767
of the debt we
got ourselves into

1409
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,768
when we bred them,

1410
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:30,070
much less any of
the other bills.

1411
01:19:30,104 --> 01:19:31,740
- Bob, he's right.

1412
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:33,240
When you can't
even pay the bills,

1413
01:19:33,274 --> 01:19:35,376
you gotta make a change.

1414
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:36,343
- Change?

1415
01:19:37,411 --> 01:19:38,580
Change to what?

1416
01:19:39,748 --> 01:19:41,849
This is all that
I have ever done.

1417
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:43,685
This farm was handed
down in the family

1418
01:19:43,718 --> 01:19:46,820
to keep in the family and
that's where I'm gonna keep it.

1419
01:19:46,854 --> 01:19:48,690
- But, Dad, times have changed.

1420
01:19:48,723 --> 01:19:51,825
You just, you can't
make a living out of it

1421
01:19:51,859 --> 01:19:55,062
unless you expand or
diversify or something.

1422
01:19:55,095 --> 01:19:57,732
And when you get a drought
like we got two years ago

1423
01:19:57,766 --> 01:20:00,234
or with the heavy
rainfall from last year,

1424
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:01,603
or like what just happened,

1425
01:20:01,636 --> 01:20:03,237
you can't keep going.

1426
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:04,572
- Like hell I can't.

1427
01:20:05,674 --> 01:20:06,508
- With what?

1428
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:09,143
When you can't pay the bills

1429
01:20:09,176 --> 01:20:11,713
or even put food on the table.

1430
01:20:11,746 --> 01:20:13,347
We used up most of our
savings last year just trying

1431
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,582
to keep ahead.

1432
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,852
And most men your
age are retiring

1433
01:20:18,886 --> 01:20:21,221
and collecting their pensions.

1434
01:20:21,255 --> 01:20:22,524
You don't even have a pension.

1435
01:20:22,557 --> 01:20:24,892
You don't have anything
but this place.

1436
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:26,561
If we sold to the developers,

1437
01:20:26,594 --> 01:20:29,430
at least we'd have a
chance to live comfortably

1438
01:20:29,463 --> 01:20:30,598
at our old age.

1439
01:20:48,415 --> 01:20:49,883
Bob, I'm sorry.

1440
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:01,730
- Mom.

1441
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:03,598
Look, there's gotta be
something we can do.

1442
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:05,533
I'll start coming
up with a plan.

1443
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:08,335
Maybe the ag department at
the university can help.

1444
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:10,371
- Jodi, you don't know
what we're up against.

1445
01:21:10,404 --> 01:21:11,573
- I'm just saying
there's gotta be

1446
01:21:11,606 --> 01:21:12,540
some different
options of things-

1447
01:21:12,574 --> 01:21:14,308
- That was the cops.

1448
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:15,844
Willie's at the police station.

1449
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:17,679
We gotta go bail him out.

1450
01:21:17,712 --> 01:21:18,713
- Oh, God.

1451
01:21:18,747 --> 01:21:20,481
- Oh, what'd the fool do now?

1452
01:21:20,515 --> 01:21:22,182
- He went to get even
with the four-wheelers.

1453
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:23,917
- Oh, that dummy.

1454
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:30,525
Well, at least he's a
loyal dummy, let's go.

1455
01:21:44,304 --> 01:21:45,707
- Mom, don't cry.

1456
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,244
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

1457
01:22:23,343 --> 01:22:24,546
- How you guys doing?

1458
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:26,013
What seems to be
the problem, sir?

1459
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:28,382
- What are you doing with
those yew bushes, boy?

1460
01:22:28,415 --> 01:22:30,050
- Yew bushes? Oh,
those are yew bushes?

1461
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:31,318
- That's right.

1462
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:32,554
- Oh, wife and I just
moved into a new place

1463
01:22:32,587 --> 01:22:34,321
up there at, you know,
Creekside Farm Estates.

1464
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:35,623
- Farm estates?

1465
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:37,124
- Right, right, we're
just clearing out

1466
01:22:37,157 --> 01:22:38,927
the property and just was
gonna dump 'em over here

1467
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,194
in the pasture.

1468
01:22:40,227 --> 01:22:41,629
Those cows seem to
really love 'em.

1469
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:43,798
- Don't throw anymore out there.

1470
01:22:43,832 --> 01:22:45,934
- Oh, yeah, sure, I don't
wanna cause any trouble.

1471
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:47,869
- Those bushes aren't
good for cattle.

1472
01:22:49,036 --> 01:22:50,204
- Oh, I am so sorry.

1473
01:22:50,237 --> 01:22:52,973
I didn't know, I had no idea.

1474
01:22:53,006 --> 01:22:54,642
Like, really, I won't
dump 'em there anymore.

1475
01:22:54,676 --> 01:22:56,544
I'll find someplace else.

1476
01:22:56,578 --> 01:22:57,411
- You do that.

1477
01:22:58,245 --> 01:22:59,046
Come on, Frank.

1478
01:22:59,079 --> 01:22:59,881
- Have a nice day, guys.

1479
01:22:59,914 --> 01:23:00,748
- Come on.

1480
01:23:05,152 --> 01:23:08,055
- Is that all you're
gonna say to him?

1481
01:23:08,088 --> 01:23:10,057
Is that all you're gonna do?

1482
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:11,291
We should sue him or something.

1483
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:13,260
- Sometimes you just
gotta forgive 'em son.

1484
01:23:13,293 --> 01:23:14,896
He did not know
what he was doing.

1485
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:16,764
- But those heifers.

1486
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:18,566
- You gotta let it go.

1487
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,901
There ain't nothing
you can do about

1488
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:21,301
those heifers now.

1489
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:22,871
Sometimes you just
gotta forget about it

1490
01:23:22,904 --> 01:23:24,506
and go on.

1491
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:26,641
Sometimes you just gotta go on.

1492
01:23:37,852 --> 01:23:39,954
- All right, so this
new program I developed,

1493
01:23:39,988 --> 01:23:41,388
some made several variables

1494
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:43,257
to help us making
building decisions based

1495
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:45,927
on age demographics,
income levels,

1496
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,862
current population,
even traffic patterns.

1497
01:23:47,896 --> 01:23:50,565
Now, the program has taken
the information I fed it

1498
01:23:50,598 --> 01:23:53,066
and has come up with the
most feasible location

1499
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,134
for the building site

1500
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:55,970
of this transformational
development.

1501
01:23:56,004 --> 01:23:57,872
I saved the results to present

1502
01:23:57,906 --> 01:23:59,373
to you, Mr. Poole.

1503
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:00,909
I haven't even had a chance
yet to take a look at it.

1504
01:24:00,942 --> 01:24:02,142
- Oh, that's fine.

1505
01:24:02,175 --> 01:24:03,811
We didn't give you
a whole lot of time.

1506
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:05,078
Let's have it.

1507
01:24:05,112 --> 01:24:05,947
- Here goes.

1508
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:12,119
- Oh, yeah, there's
Lindon Hill Road

1509
01:24:12,152 --> 01:24:14,388
and that's where it
intersects with Limestone.

1510
01:24:14,421 --> 01:24:16,089
Yeah, I know that area.

1511
01:24:16,123 --> 01:24:17,926
There's a lot of
development going on there.

1512
01:24:17,959 --> 01:24:18,960
- Wait.

1513
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,161
- Michael, what is it?

1514
01:24:21,194 --> 01:24:22,564
- Isn't that, uh?

1515
01:24:22,597 --> 01:24:24,632
- Yeah, it's farmland.

1516
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:26,099
We'll probably
get it dirt cheap.

1517
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:28,302
Then we'll have to
rezone, build by spring.

1518
01:24:28,335 --> 01:24:30,270
It's the perfect spot, perfect.

1519
01:24:30,304 --> 01:24:32,507
- But what if they
farmer won't sell?

1520
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:36,878
- They'll sell, don't
worry about that.

1521
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:38,846
- You know there's other
variables I should put in.

1522
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,014
This may not be the best place

1523
01:24:40,048 --> 01:24:41,214
for us to build.

1524
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:42,416
This is only the first
time I've done it.

1525
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:45,385
- I'm satisfied.
Great job, Michael.

1526
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:48,121
I think this might be
worth another promotion.

1527
01:24:49,323 --> 01:24:51,425
I think it's cause
for a celebration.

1528
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,628
In fact, I have a lunch meeting

1529
01:24:53,661 --> 01:24:56,798
with someone that I would
love for you to meet.

1530
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:57,699
Are you free?

1531
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:03,871
- Yes, sir.

1532
01:25:03,905 --> 01:25:05,172
- Excellent.

1533
01:25:05,205 --> 01:25:07,174
Gentlemen, that'll be all.

1534
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,048
- Call me, Jim, son.

1535
01:25:14,082 --> 01:25:15,550
How many times I
gotta tell you that?

1536
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:17,184
We're on our way, kid.

1537
01:25:23,256 --> 01:25:24,424
- Yes, I know the place.

1538
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:26,060
That's the Stafford farm.

1539
01:25:26,094 --> 01:25:27,795
We handle their account.

1540
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:30,098
They've been having
some trouble lately.

1541
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,331
- Is that right?

1542
01:25:31,365 --> 01:25:34,569
- Seems some of their
AI heifers got poisoned.

1543
01:25:34,602 --> 01:25:36,904
They're really
behind on their loan.

1544
01:25:36,938 --> 01:25:39,040
I don't know how they're
going to pull out of it.

1545
01:25:39,073 --> 01:25:40,675
It's the same story with a lot

1546
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:43,343
of the other farm
loans, pitiful.

1547
01:25:43,377 --> 01:25:44,779
- I know, I know.

1548
01:25:44,812 --> 01:25:46,380
It's a shame.

1549
01:25:46,413 --> 01:25:48,583
I just don't understand
how so many farmers borrow

1550
01:25:48,616 --> 01:25:50,384
so heavily and get into debt

1551
01:25:50,417 --> 01:25:52,285
they're never gonna get out of.

1552
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:54,088
It's like they're
never gonna learn.

1553
01:25:54,989 --> 01:25:56,189
- Well, the bank's learning.

1554
01:25:56,223 --> 01:25:58,458
We're really picking up
on loans to developers

1555
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:00,260
as you know.

1556
01:26:00,293 --> 01:26:02,897
- Well, I hope we haven't
let you down now, have we?

1557
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:08,268
Uh, about Stafford, exactly
how far behind is he?

1558
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:10,605
- Far enough.

1559
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:12,106
- Far enough to sell out?

1560
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:12,974
- No.

1561
01:26:14,307 --> 01:26:15,510
- What was that, Mike?

1562
01:26:15,543 --> 01:26:18,780
- Oh, I mean, I meant
that it can be difficult

1563
01:26:18,813 --> 01:26:20,515
to get farmers to
sell sometimes.

1564
01:26:20,548 --> 01:26:22,150
- Well, if they won't sell,

1565
01:26:22,182 --> 01:26:23,551
then we have to convince them

1566
01:26:23,584 --> 01:26:25,687
that they're heading
for disaster,

1567
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,355
that they need to pursue
another line of work

1568
01:26:28,388 --> 01:26:31,425
and that we can't
support them any longer.

1569
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:34,461
- In other words, we'll
have to foreclose, right?

1570
01:26:34,494 --> 01:26:36,564
I mean, it's for their own good.

1571
01:26:39,033 --> 01:26:40,568
- Is it?

1572
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:41,669
- Certainly.

1573
01:26:41,703 --> 01:26:43,303
Most of the time
they're grateful

1574
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:44,972
when they change jobs

1575
01:26:45,006 --> 01:26:46,974
and realize they've
been working themselves

1576
01:26:47,008 --> 01:26:49,177
to death on the
farm for nothing.

1577
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:51,546
I've seen it happen many times.

1578
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:52,412
- Have you?

1579
01:26:53,581 --> 01:26:54,949
- Now all we gotta
do is put it in front

1580
01:26:54,982 --> 01:26:56,349
of the planning board first.

1581
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:58,686
- To which I have
just been appointed.

1582
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,821
- What?

1583
01:26:59,854 --> 01:27:01,556
Outstanding.

1584
01:27:01,589 --> 01:27:03,290
Then all we gotta do is
bring our presentation

1585
01:27:03,323 --> 01:27:06,094
to the county council
at the end of the month

1586
01:27:06,127 --> 01:27:08,529
and then we'll bring
along the model

1587
01:27:08,563 --> 01:27:10,031
and present that at the meeting

1588
01:27:10,064 --> 01:27:11,632
and we'll get the
town's people, you know,

1589
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:13,534
used to the idea.

1590
01:27:13,568 --> 01:27:15,870
And I think they're
gonna love it.

1591
01:27:15,903 --> 01:27:20,908
Maybe we should have you do
the presentation, Michael.

1592
01:27:22,043 --> 01:27:23,511
- Well.

1593
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:24,746
- Right?

1594
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:26,446
Then all we gotta do
is get a majority vote

1595
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,682
and we are in.

1596
01:27:29,117 --> 01:27:34,088
Just think, Michael, you're
responsible, congratulations.

1597
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:36,524
I'm telling you,
this young man is

1598
01:27:36,557 --> 01:27:37,658
the cream of the crop.

1599
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:46,801
- I'll go see if
Diane's ready to go.

1600
01:27:48,136 --> 01:27:48,970
Michael?

1601
01:27:51,572 --> 01:27:53,040
What's wrong?

1602
01:27:53,074 --> 01:27:55,877
You're not nervous about the
planning meeting, are you?

1603
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:57,078
- This is just the first step.

1604
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:58,913
We're just getting
the used to the idea.

1605
01:27:58,946 --> 01:28:00,181
- You don't even have
to open your mouth

1606
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:02,617
until the presentation
at the county council.

1607
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:04,519
That's at the end of the month.

1608
01:28:04,552 --> 01:28:05,352
- Cheer up, man.

1609
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:07,021
- No, I'm sorry.

1610
01:28:07,054 --> 01:28:09,289
I'm just, I've had
a lot on my mind.

1611
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:12,660
- Okay, you're sure
you'll all right then.

1612
01:28:14,629 --> 01:28:15,530
All right.

1613
01:28:15,563 --> 01:28:17,430
I'll be back in a few minutes.

1614
01:29:28,703 --> 01:29:29,537
- Well?

1615
01:29:31,672 --> 01:29:32,974
- Well, what do you think?

1616
01:29:34,842 --> 01:29:35,676
- Where's Dad?

1617
01:29:37,078 --> 01:29:38,445
- He's outside telling Mom.

1618
01:29:42,783 --> 01:29:45,720
I saw your boyfriend
at the bank.

1619
01:29:45,753 --> 01:29:47,154
- What?

1620
01:29:47,188 --> 01:29:50,358
- He was sitting in a
fancy car outside the bank.

1621
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:51,826
- Are you talking about Mike?

1622
01:29:53,127 --> 01:29:54,295
- That was the last
boyfriend you had, wasn't it?

1623
01:29:54,328 --> 01:29:56,097
- Well, what was he doing there?

1624
01:29:58,032 --> 01:30:00,001
- I don't know.

1625
01:30:00,034 --> 01:30:01,869
Maybe he was trying to rob
the place or something.

1626
01:30:01,903 --> 01:30:03,638
- Very funny.

1627
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:08,576
Frank.

1628
01:30:10,344 --> 01:30:12,113
What are we gonna do?

1629
01:30:14,348 --> 01:30:15,583
- I don't know.

1630
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:17,718
I just don't know.

1631
01:30:55,523 --> 01:30:58,059
- Michael, hey, good to see you.

1632
01:30:58,092 --> 01:30:59,126
Glad you stopped by.

1633
01:31:00,493 --> 01:31:01,362
- Hey, Dad.

1634
01:31:02,596 --> 01:31:04,464
- Hey, how'd
the planning meeting go?

1635
01:31:04,497 --> 01:31:06,200
- It was okay, I guess.

1636
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:07,401
- Good, good.

1637
01:31:07,435 --> 01:31:08,436
- They seemed to
really like the plans.

1638
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:09,704
- Great.

1639
01:31:09,737 --> 01:31:11,138
That'll make for an
even stronger case

1640
01:31:11,172 --> 01:31:12,573
at the county council meeting.

1641
01:31:14,442 --> 01:31:15,776
- Where's Mom?

1642
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:16,711
- She and your sister had

1643
01:31:16,744 --> 01:31:18,112
to go shopping somewhere.

1644
01:31:20,181 --> 01:31:21,916
But you know, Mike.

1645
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:24,852
Here lately, I've been
kind of worried about you.

1646
01:31:24,885 --> 01:31:27,421
You know, I felt like you
were just playing around

1647
01:31:27,455 --> 01:31:31,292
too much, but you've
really proven yourself.

1648
01:31:31,325 --> 01:31:33,627
Jim Poole, he speaks
pretty highly of you.

1649
01:31:34,662 --> 01:31:35,463
- Thanks, Dad.

1650
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:38,099
- You know, there comes a time

1651
01:31:38,132 --> 01:31:42,803
when you realize where
your responsibilities lie.

1652
01:31:42,837 --> 01:31:44,739
You just wake up one
day and you realize

1653
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:49,210
that you've got to take
charge and do what's right.

1654
01:31:49,243 --> 01:31:50,444
- What'd you say?

1655
01:31:50,478 --> 01:31:51,645
- I said there comes a time

1656
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,047
when you have to
wake up and realize

1657
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:56,817
you gotta take charge
and do the right thing.

1658
01:31:58,986 --> 01:32:00,554
- You're right.

1659
01:32:00,588 --> 01:32:02,156
You're absolutely right, Dad.

1660
01:32:03,224 --> 01:32:04,959
See you.

1661
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,027
- Where you going?

1662
01:32:07,228 --> 01:32:09,363
- I just got something
I need to tell somebody.

1663
01:32:09,397 --> 01:32:10,965
- Okay.

1664
01:32:10,998 --> 01:32:11,999
Bye.

1665
01:32:51,972 --> 01:32:53,508
- Jodi.

1666
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:54,341
It's getting late.

1667
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:55,810
- No, I know.

1668
01:32:55,843 --> 01:32:58,612
I have two more pages to
finish on this lesson plan.

1669
01:32:58,646 --> 01:32:59,480
School will be starting back

1670
01:32:59,514 --> 01:33:00,381
before I know it.

1671
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:04,485
All right, I'm going up.

1672
01:33:06,153 --> 01:33:07,388
Don't forget to
turn the lights out.

1673
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:08,289
- Goodnight.

1674
01:33:08,322 --> 01:33:09,123
- Goodnight.

1675
01:33:25,706 --> 01:33:26,774
- Skip.

1676
01:33:26,807 --> 01:33:27,808
- Hi, Jodi.

1677
01:33:30,144 --> 01:33:31,879
Well, can I come in?

1678
01:33:31,912 --> 01:33:34,748
- Yeah, sorry, I'm just
surprised to see you.

1679
01:33:36,717 --> 01:33:37,685
I thought you were going back

1680
01:33:37,718 --> 01:33:39,420
to North Carolina this month.

1681
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:40,354
- Well, I don't have to be back

1682
01:33:40,387 --> 01:33:41,523
till the end of the week.

1683
01:33:41,556 --> 01:33:45,092
So I thought I'd
stop by and say hello

1684
01:33:45,126 --> 01:33:46,727
before I leave for good.

1685
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,063
- Well, how's the
speaker circuit going?

1686
01:33:49,096 --> 01:33:49,930
- Really well.

1687
01:33:51,065 --> 01:33:52,900
But, it gets kind of lonely.

1688
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:57,071
Here, have a seat.

1689
01:33:57,104 --> 01:33:58,839
- Oh, no, thanks,
I'd rather stand.

1690
01:33:58,873 --> 01:34:00,774
Been in the car all day.

1691
01:34:00,808 --> 01:34:01,610
- Would you like some iced tea?

1692
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:02,676
I just made some.

1693
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:03,612
- That'd be great.

1694
01:34:10,151 --> 01:34:10,985
Thank you.

1695
01:34:14,054 --> 01:34:15,990
- You know, everybody
just went to bed.

1696
01:34:16,023 --> 01:34:16,924
Why don't I wake them up.

1697
01:34:16,957 --> 01:34:18,159
I know they'd like to see you.

1698
01:34:18,192 --> 01:34:19,960
- No, no, no, no,
don't wake them up.

1699
01:34:27,201 --> 01:34:29,370
Uh, lesson plans?

1700
01:34:29,403 --> 01:34:32,940
- Yeah, I, uh,
curriculum changed again,

1701
01:34:32,973 --> 01:34:35,376
so having to adapt.

1702
01:34:35,409 --> 01:34:36,377
- How's that going?

1703
01:34:37,311 --> 01:34:39,380
- It's okay.

1704
01:34:39,413 --> 01:34:40,714
I get tired.

1705
01:34:40,748 --> 01:34:42,082
My neck gets so stiff.

1706
01:34:42,116 --> 01:34:43,250
I don't know how people sit

1707
01:34:43,284 --> 01:34:45,085
and work at a computer all day.

1708
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:46,086
- Stiff neck, huh?

1709
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,288
- Yeah.

1710
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:48,856
- Well, I've always
been pretty good

1711
01:34:48,889 --> 01:34:49,990
at getting cramps out.

1712
01:34:51,192 --> 01:34:52,426
I learned the technique
when I played football,

1713
01:34:52,459 --> 01:34:53,595
here let me help you.

1714
01:34:53,628 --> 01:34:54,828
- No, that's okay.

1715
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:57,064
- Come on, you'll feel
better, I guarantee it.

1716
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:09,276
- You know, Jodi, I
really only came back here

1717
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:10,811
to see you.

1718
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:12,913
- You did?

1719
01:35:13,814 --> 01:35:14,649
- Sure did.

1720
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:18,819
I've been thinking about
you ever since I left,

1721
01:35:18,852 --> 01:35:20,221
after the heifer's died.

1722
01:35:21,388 --> 01:35:23,490
- Oh, come on, I bet
you have girls hanging

1723
01:35:23,525 --> 01:35:25,560
all over you on the road.

1724
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:27,061
- Well, sure.

1725
01:35:29,363 --> 01:35:31,832
But my mind kept
coming back to you.

1726
01:36:35,829 --> 01:36:37,364
- What are you doing?

1727
01:36:37,398 --> 01:36:38,332
- It's okay.

1728
01:36:38,365 --> 01:36:40,167
- No, no, no, it's not okay

1729
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,569
and my parents are
right upstairs.

1730
01:36:41,603 --> 01:36:43,505
- They won't hear
us, come on, Jodi.

1731
01:36:43,538 --> 01:36:44,572
- Cut it out.

1732
01:36:46,307 --> 01:36:48,208
- What the hell's
the matter with you?

1733
01:36:53,682 --> 01:36:56,183
- Get the hell out of here
before I have to use it.

1734
01:37:00,622 --> 01:37:02,256
- Okay.

1735
01:37:02,289 --> 01:37:04,626
I'm sorry, just
put the gun down.

1736
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:06,728
I'm going.

1737
01:37:06,761 --> 01:37:08,295
- Now before I wake my Daddy

1738
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:09,731
and he won't hesitate.

1739
01:39:00,842 --> 01:39:02,877
- Good evening
ladies and gentlemen.

1740
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:04,411
That doesn't even sound right.

1741
01:39:24,331 --> 01:39:27,902
- What do you mean
you changed your mind?

1742
01:39:27,936 --> 01:39:29,303
I thought we had a deal?

1743
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:38,913
You know I need
your vote on this.

1744
01:39:40,113 --> 01:39:41,081
Are you crazy?

1745
01:39:41,114 --> 01:39:44,218
I offered you $50,000.

1746
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:47,689
What are you doing to me?

1747
01:39:47,722 --> 01:39:49,490
Did you suddenly
grow a conscience?

1748
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:52,259
I got this through the
planning commission,

1749
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:54,495
but I need you to get
it through the hicks

1750
01:39:54,529 --> 01:39:56,296
on the county council.

1751
01:40:03,403 --> 01:40:04,739
I'll talk to you later.

1752
01:40:45,647 --> 01:40:47,414
- May I have your
attention please.

1753
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:49,817
At the top of the
agenda tonight,

1754
01:40:49,851 --> 01:40:51,819
we have a special presentation.

1755
01:40:51,853 --> 01:40:53,788
I think we'll all be
interested in hearing it.

1756
01:40:53,821 --> 01:40:56,691
Here's Mr. Jim Poole of Poole
& Associates Real Estate

1757
01:40:56,724 --> 01:40:57,892
to tell us all about it.

1758
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,060
- Thank you Mr. O'Neil.

1759
01:41:01,729 --> 01:41:03,998
It's wonderful to see
such a large turnout

1760
01:41:04,032 --> 01:41:06,400
for tonight's presentation.

1761
01:41:06,433 --> 01:41:08,736
My colleagues and I
are happy to share

1762
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,606
with your our most
ambitious project to date,

1763
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:14,241
a project that I'm
sure you'll agree

1764
01:41:14,274 --> 01:41:16,811
will benefit the
area many, many ways.

1765
01:41:16,844 --> 01:41:18,178
To present this project to you,

1766
01:41:18,211 --> 01:41:21,114
is our own Michael Jared,

1767
01:41:21,148 --> 01:41:24,384
who has been instrumental
in developing ideas

1768
01:41:24,418 --> 01:41:27,622
and also choosing the
location for the project.

1769
01:41:27,655 --> 01:41:30,658
Without further ado,
Michael, you have the floor.

1770
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:37,065
- Thank you, Mr. Poole.

1771
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:42,070
And as Mr. Poole said, this
project he's speaking of

1772
01:41:42,102 --> 01:41:44,639
would be of great
benefit to the people

1773
01:41:44,672 --> 01:41:45,506
of this county.

1774
01:41:47,174 --> 01:41:48,408
Marking studies show

1775
01:41:48,442 --> 01:41:51,613
that this project will
benefit the community

1776
01:41:51,646 --> 01:41:53,548
by creating fresh
housing and retail

1777
01:41:53,581 --> 01:41:54,816
along with job opportunities

1778
01:41:54,849 --> 01:41:56,985
to elevate the economy

1779
01:41:57,018 --> 01:41:58,886
and we spent many long hours

1780
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,253
with community studies

1781
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:01,522
and computer programs in order

1782
01:42:01,556 --> 01:42:03,223
to facilitate the best way

1783
01:42:03,256 --> 01:42:05,026
in order to put this
plan into action.

1784
01:42:05,059 --> 01:42:06,027
- What are you talking about?

1785
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:06,861
- What is it?

1786
01:42:06,894 --> 01:42:07,929
- Where is going to be?

1787
01:42:07,962 --> 01:42:09,597
- Please, just let me finish.

1788
01:42:10,765 --> 01:42:13,333
This, this project will
involve all of you.

1789
01:42:13,367 --> 01:42:15,402
The planning commission
has reviewed it

1790
01:42:15,435 --> 01:42:16,504
and they're in favor,

1791
01:42:16,537 --> 01:42:19,540
so this transformation
development

1792
01:42:19,574 --> 01:42:21,809
is a new concept in real estate.

1793
01:42:21,843 --> 01:42:23,978
This is a multi-use project,

1794
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:26,714
so residential,
single-family homes,

1795
01:42:26,748 --> 01:42:28,783
condos, senior living apartment,

1796
01:42:28,816 --> 01:42:30,384
as well as retail commercial

1797
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:32,654
and light industrial
uses are included

1798
01:42:32,687 --> 01:42:37,224
to create a lively work
and play community aspect.

1799
01:42:38,526 --> 01:42:40,728
And it will take place

1800
01:42:40,762 --> 01:42:42,096
on over 288 acres.

1801
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:42,964
- Where's it going to be?

1802
01:42:42,997 --> 01:42:44,364
- Yeah, where?

1803
01:42:44,398 --> 01:42:46,067
- Where's it gonna be?

1804
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,001
- Quit stalling.

1805
01:42:47,035 --> 01:42:48,335
- Yeah, come on.

1806
01:42:50,571 --> 01:42:53,473
Come on, hurry up.

1807
01:42:53,508 --> 01:42:54,742
- Computer studies show

1808
01:42:54,776 --> 01:42:59,547
that the most logical,
practical, accessible

1809
01:43:00,715 --> 01:43:01,883
and economic location
for this development

1810
01:43:01,916 --> 01:43:04,986
would be right here
where Limestone

1811
01:43:05,019 --> 01:43:06,521
and Lindon Hill Road meet.

1812
01:43:08,321 --> 01:43:09,524
- Hey, that's the
Stafford place.

1813
01:43:09,557 --> 01:43:11,191
- So that's why they're
foreclosing on them.

1814
01:43:11,224 --> 01:43:12,160
- To make room for this?

1815
01:43:12,192 --> 01:43:13,628
No.

1816
01:43:14,595 --> 01:43:15,830
- Please let me finish.

1817
01:43:15,863 --> 01:43:18,432
This is gonna benefit
the entire area, okay.

1818
01:43:20,902 --> 01:43:23,236
This is a department store,

1819
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:24,872
that's a full service
automotive center.

1820
01:43:24,906 --> 01:43:26,874
There's a bistro,
there's a cafe.

1821
01:43:26,908 --> 01:43:28,042
I mean, can't you just imagine

1822
01:43:28,076 --> 01:43:29,877
the beautifully
landscaped development

1823
01:43:29,911 --> 01:43:31,478
on this piece of farmland?

1824
01:43:31,512 --> 01:43:34,082
The playgrounds and
the restaurants?

1825
01:43:36,584 --> 01:43:38,820
It's gonna be a
great place to live.

1826
01:44:13,121 --> 01:44:14,055
This is ridiculous.

1827
01:44:14,088 --> 01:44:16,256
- Come on.

1828
01:44:20,293 --> 01:44:21,129
- Well.

1829
01:44:22,096 --> 01:44:24,599
- Jared. Michael sit down.

1830
01:44:24,632 --> 01:44:25,967
I'll finish the presentation.

1831
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,068
- Let him talk.

1832
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:33,875
- Okay.

1833
01:44:37,245 --> 01:44:40,948
- I thought this
was a good idea.

1834
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:45,787
You know, houses,
progress, stores,

1835
01:44:47,255 --> 01:44:49,123
jobs for people, it
all sounds great.

1836
01:44:50,892 --> 01:44:52,392
It does and maybe it would be,

1837
01:44:53,561 --> 01:44:56,463
but, I mean, you could
always use a new store,

1838
01:44:57,598 --> 01:44:59,534
a housing development,
road, skyscraper,

1839
01:44:59,567 --> 01:45:01,068
we could use all those things,

1840
01:45:02,335 --> 01:45:06,473
but the problem is you forget.

1841
01:45:09,577 --> 01:45:11,646
You forget what
you have to give up

1842
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,214
to get what you think you want.

1843
01:45:15,183 --> 01:45:16,717
Sure, we want this development,

1844
01:45:17,618 --> 01:45:18,686
but we need the farm.

1845
01:45:20,453 --> 01:45:21,255
Even if it is only to look at

1846
01:45:21,289 --> 01:45:22,422
when you drive by.

1847
01:45:23,991 --> 01:45:25,693
See the cows grazing
in the field,

1848
01:45:27,161 --> 01:45:28,863
the combines
harvesting the wheat.

1849
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,334
We need it to remind
us where we came from.

1850
01:45:36,637 --> 01:45:39,073
And the Stafford
family needs their farm

1851
01:45:39,106 --> 01:45:40,608
like their ancestors did,

1852
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:43,511
to live and to work on.

1853
01:45:47,515 --> 01:45:49,250
Sure, we could build
this development,

1854
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:53,554
but maybe we should
save the farm instead.

1855
01:45:55,523 --> 01:45:59,193
I worked hard on this project,

1856
01:45:59,227 --> 01:46:01,295
but not as hard as I
worked on that farm.

1857
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:06,834
And I'm asking the
county council tonight

1858
01:46:06,868 --> 01:46:08,435
to vote against this project

1859
01:46:08,468 --> 01:46:10,938
in accordance with the
American Farmland Trust.

1860
01:46:15,076 --> 01:46:16,711
Sorry about the
model, Mr. Poole.

1861
01:46:29,389 --> 01:46:30,423
- Wait.

1862
01:46:30,457 --> 01:46:32,660
You could talk all you want,

1863
01:46:32,693 --> 01:46:34,896
but it won't make
any difference.

1864
01:46:34,929 --> 01:46:37,665
Damn county council don't
care what they build on.

1865
01:46:38,766 --> 01:46:39,901
Next thing you
know, there won't be

1866
01:46:39,934 --> 01:46:42,036
any farmland left.

1867
01:46:42,069 --> 01:46:44,505
- Yeah, there's nothing
you can do about it.

1868
01:46:44,538 --> 01:46:47,775
They'll foreclose,
it'll go through.

1869
01:46:47,808 --> 01:46:48,809
- It always does.

1870
01:46:50,778 --> 01:46:52,780
- Let me address this.

1871
01:46:52,813 --> 01:46:54,982
- Yes, sir, you are right,

1872
01:46:55,016 --> 01:46:57,184
this will go through
'cause it's the best thing

1873
01:46:57,218 --> 01:46:58,418
for the area.

1874
01:46:58,451 --> 01:47:00,121
And for the Stafford farm,

1875
01:47:00,154 --> 01:47:02,489
it's the best thing
for you to foreclose

1876
01:47:02,523 --> 01:47:04,558
and you will find that
out in the long run.

1877
01:47:04,592 --> 01:47:06,394
- You son of a-
- Daddy.

1878
01:47:06,426 --> 01:47:07,261
- Wait, wait.

1879
01:47:08,996 --> 01:47:11,232
I don't think anyone's
foreclosing on anyone.

1880
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:14,201
- What?

1881
01:47:14,235 --> 01:47:15,803
- I hoped I wouldn't
have to do this.

1882
01:47:17,338 --> 01:47:18,839
- I thought we had deal.

1883
01:47:20,007 --> 01:47:22,610
You know I need
your vote on this.

1884
01:47:22,643 --> 01:47:23,644
Are you crazy?

1885
01:47:23,678 --> 01:47:25,546
I offered you $50,000.

1886
01:47:25,579 --> 01:47:27,181
What are you doing to me?

1887
01:47:27,214 --> 01:47:29,250
I got this through the
planning commission,

1888
01:47:29,283 --> 01:47:31,451
but I need you to get
it through the hicks

1889
01:47:31,484 --> 01:47:32,920
on the county council.

1890
01:47:32,954 --> 01:47:33,854
Let go of me.

1891
01:47:33,888 --> 01:47:34,889
You cretin, let go, I'll sue.

1892
01:47:34,922 --> 01:47:36,489
Let go.

1893
01:47:37,358 --> 01:47:38,259
I'll sue.

1894
01:47:38,292 --> 01:47:40,628
- Everybody calm down now,

1895
01:47:40,661 --> 01:47:42,363
everybody calm down now.

1896
01:47:42,396 --> 01:47:43,597
Settle down.

1897
01:47:43,631 --> 01:47:45,766
Settle down now.

1898
01:47:47,501 --> 01:47:49,203
Everything is under control.

1899
01:47:50,805 --> 01:47:51,605
Mr. Poole.

1900
01:47:51,639 --> 01:47:52,840
- Thank you.

1901
01:47:52,873 --> 01:47:54,175
- I think you just
better come with me.

1902
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,978
- You can't do this.

1903
01:47:57,011 --> 01:47:58,846
I didn't do any-, what,
I didn't to anything,

1904
01:47:58,879 --> 01:47:59,914
what are you doing?

1905
01:47:59,947 --> 01:48:01,782
The whole thing's a lie.

1906
01:48:01,816 --> 01:48:03,250
That tape is fixed.

1907
01:48:03,284 --> 01:48:06,053
Michael Jared, you'll never work

1908
01:48:06,087 --> 01:48:08,155
in real estate again.

1909
01:48:08,189 --> 01:48:09,290
- No problem.

1910
01:48:20,034 --> 01:48:20,935
- Proud of you.

1911
01:48:20,968 --> 01:48:23,104
It's prejudicious, it's amateur.

1912
01:48:23,137 --> 01:48:23,971
- Oh, thanks.

1913
01:48:24,839 --> 01:48:26,040
Hey.

1914
01:48:26,073 --> 01:48:28,743
- Mike, proud
of you, great job.

1915
01:48:41,589 --> 01:48:42,857
- What the?

1916
01:48:48,996 --> 01:48:50,331
- Whoo!

1917
01:48:50,364 --> 01:48:51,532
Where's it at.

1918
01:49:21,595 --> 01:49:22,997
- Thank you.

1919
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:24,565
- No, don't thank me.

1920
01:49:24,598 --> 01:49:27,368
I'm the one who
should thank you.

1921
01:49:29,403 --> 01:49:32,106
I'm, I'm sorry I ever left.

1922
01:49:33,307 --> 01:49:34,141
- Me, too.

1923
01:49:36,811 --> 01:49:38,712
- But what about, um...

1924
01:49:39,914 --> 01:49:40,981
- About what?

1925
01:49:42,049 --> 01:49:43,250
- Skip.

1926
01:49:43,284 --> 01:49:44,318
- Skip?

1927
01:49:45,786 --> 01:49:47,721
- Yeah, I thought you and he-

1928
01:49:47,755 --> 01:49:49,957
- That jerk's not worth
scraping my boot on.

1929
01:49:53,227 --> 01:49:54,261
- I was hoping you'd say that.

1930
01:49:56,764 --> 01:49:59,967
- Hey, boy, looks like
your ride left without you.

1931
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,801
- Yes, sir.

1932
01:50:02,002 --> 01:50:03,637
- Well, get in.

1933
01:50:03,671 --> 01:50:04,772
Come on over to our place.

1934
01:50:04,805 --> 01:50:06,440
I wanna talk to you.

1935
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:09,410
- Yes, sir, I'd like to
talk to you, too, sir.

1936
01:50:09,443 --> 01:50:11,445
It's just, sir,
I have some ideas

1937
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:15,149
that I would really like
to, uh, tell you about.

1938
01:50:15,182 --> 01:50:16,817
- I bet you do.

1939
01:50:16,851 --> 01:50:19,320
I guess we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

1940
01:50:20,522 --> 01:50:23,290
Now get in, you're
