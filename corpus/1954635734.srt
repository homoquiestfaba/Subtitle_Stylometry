1
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:46,240
You really think world
will be a safer place

2
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,556
without me, Tom?

3
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:52,401
The families of the twelve girls you
raped and murdered would think so.

4
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,660
I'm thankful to you
for coming all this way.

5
00:01:57,287 --> 00:02:00,288
Well, you know you and
I we've come full circle, Dimtri.

6
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,948
From your first killing
til I caught you.

7
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:06,747
You know? A reporter
came this morning,

8
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:09,878
asked if I feel,

9
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:13,096
if I could have been rehabilitated
after all these years...

10
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:14,377
I said yes.

11
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,515
But, you know what?

12
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:21,015
You let me out that door,

13
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,850
and I will find
the prettiest girl I see,

14
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,899
or maybe just the first girl I see,

15
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,067
and I will rape her,
and I will kill her.

16
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:38,244
After all the time
I spent wasting away in here,

17
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,958
I will enjoy even more.

18
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,456
You should
have given that to the reporter.

19
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,000
This is for you.

20
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,591
If you ever write a book,
you can write about me.

21
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,016
You don't need me
to make you famous.

22
00:02:57,185 --> 00:03:00,720
There's a pack of reporters out
there waiting for your execution.

23
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:02,895
You're right.

24
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,402
Perhaps we're all

25
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:09,365
a little fascinated by killing.

26
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:14,777
Well...

27
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,203
Will you stay and watch?

28
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,661
Goodbye, Dimtri.

29
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:35,174
Tom. Daniel.

30
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,058
Are you planning
on staying in Minsk much longer?

31
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,261
Not if i can help it.

32
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,018
<i>I need you to come in on a serial.</i>

33
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:42,769
The one they call Pygmalion.

34
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:46,189
He's killed three in Spain,
now we think he's in Southern France.

35
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:47,609
Where do I start?

36
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:50,701
<i>Cannes. Look, we are gonna
e- mail you the dossier, OK?</i>

37
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,907
And we've got you
on the 1:30 flight direct to Nice.

38
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:57,990
You'll met Agent Álvarez
who heads up our Spanish Division.

39
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,373
- See you at our Barcelona Office.
- I'll be there.

40
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:17,561
- Victim is Nadine Villon?
- Worked at a nearby pharmacy.

41
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:20,443
Young, brunette.
Went missing seven days ago.

42
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,475
The body?

43
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:25,942
From a cursory examination it seems
consistent with previous victims.

44
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:30,274
Severe lacerations on her torso
and no external signs of rape.

45
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:33,914
- Sorry, who are you?
- Ok, no problem.

46
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,916
This is Agent Brindle from Europol.

47
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,496
The house was
to be completed in a few days.

48
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:42,918
- The owners were set to move in.
- Some house warming.

49
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,847
- I'll need the autopsy. Protocols.
- OK. You'll have them.

50
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,072
Let's see.

51
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,086
Excuse me.

52
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,136
He moved her from
here to over there. Why?

53
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:33,387
The struggle.

54
00:05:33,773 --> 00:05:35,600
There's no struggle.

55
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:38,938
All the blood is contained here.
No on the floor or the carpet.

56
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:41,232
He killed her here,
left her over there.

57
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,074
No. She wasn't just moved.
She was placed.

58
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:16,443
We need to get this whole side
of the glass dusted for prints.

59
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,410
Paz, this is Brindle,
Crime Unit. This is...

60
00:06:32,587 --> 00:06:35,339
Your new best friend.
- What did you get of the window.

61
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:38,084
Can a girl get
a little foreplay first?

62
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:40,924
You were right about the hair.

63
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,054
Well, not sure
if it's a hair or an eyelash

64
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:45,133
but he definitely
leaned against the window.

65
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:49,435
There were partial prints from which
we built a composite that led us to.

66
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:50,270
A match?

67
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:54,687
A long and fruitless search against
Europol's DNA database, no match.

68
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:58,482
We then cross-referenced the print
with homeland security and nothing.

69
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,069
Then we run it through the Military.

70
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:03,327
They collect DNA of every
enlisted soldier and that gave us...

71
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:05,785
- A match.
- A match.

72
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,038
A corporal.

73
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,791
Marco Soler,
24 years old, brown eyes,

74
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,126
dark brown hair.

75
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:19,094
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Maybe some water? Something?

76
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,338
You the waiter?
- How about a brunette?

77
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,225
I'd like to know why I'm here.

78
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,387
Do you like to play dress up?

79
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,521
Put women on display?
Is that what you like to do?

80
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,273
- Why am I here?
- What are you doing here?

81
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:35,936
You're the sole suspect
on a serial murder case.

82
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:37,942
- That's what you're doing here.
- What?

83
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:40,359
We've got your DNA
linked to four murders.

84
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:43,283
You're full of shit!
- Don't play games with me!

85
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,365
You don't know nothing.
You don't know shit.

86
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,748
You can say it right now.
And it'll all be over.

87
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,461
Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you.

88
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,251
We know. We know exactly

89
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,258
what's going on with you.

90
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:57,293
We know your game.
We know how you do it.

91
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:59,133
Let me refresh your memory.

92
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:04,383
January fourth, Caroline Muñoz.

93
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,555
March ninth, Soledad Ramos.

94
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,098
May thirteen, Antonia Garcia.

95
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,815
Wait... wait... Wait.
I don't believe this.

96
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:15,483
July third, Nadine Villon!

97
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:23,405
Yeah?

98
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,749
- July 3rd?
Yeah.

99
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:28,911
Did I kill anybody else?

100
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:32,293
We've got you.
We've got your DNA.

101
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:33,423
Fuck you.

102
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:35,468
Your DNA is all over the place.

103
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,722
Your DNA on four separate murders.

104
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,642
You've got the wrong man.

105
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,809
I've never seen
these girls in my life.

106
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,016
I've never even been
to any of those fucking places!

107
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:49,602
- I'm in the fucking Army.
- Don't play games with me!

108
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:53,320
I can go nowhere
without my superiors knowing.

109
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,032
Tom, I gotta talk to you right away.

110
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,788
- Can I go, detective?
- No, you can't.

111
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:04,500
What?

112
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,957
You might want to hear this.

113
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,758
Soler's kept very busy here.
He's a mechanic.

114
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:14,303
Now I've gone over
the time tables for the murders

115
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,506
- you've supplied us with and...
Yeah! Yeah!

116
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,474
- It just doesn't add up.
- Why?

117
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:21,680
The last murder occurred in Cannes
approximately Thursday night?

118
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:23,598
- Right.
- Thursday afternoon,

119
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:27,565
Soler was involved in an altercation
with a superior officer.

120
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:30,312
He was sitting
in a holding cell all weekend.

121
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:32,899
- All weekend?
- Lock and key, sir.

122
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,862
Give me the incidental report.

123
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:39,077
What the fuck?

124
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,751
Could they've got the timing wrong?
On the killing.

125
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,258
Now we narrowed it down.

126
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,178
You know, we talked
to those people that saw her last.

127
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,511
The murder overlaps his lockup.

128
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,147
The alibi.
Is there any doubt about it?

129
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:04,605
It's just that the kid
doesn't fit the profile.

130
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:06,568
He's too young
and too hot-headed, he'd...

131
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:09,857
Look, Tom. Do we need the profile?

132
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:11,528
We've got DNA.

133
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:14,828
Look guys.
I'm gonna square with you.

134
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,370
The Judiciary,
they wanna charge him, now.

135
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,371
And personally, Tom,

136
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:22,877
I won't cut loose our suspect
'cause it doesn't feel right to you.

137
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:26,038
Understood.
I'm not asking you to cut him loose,

138
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,965
just don't let them
charge him yet. That's all.

139
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:33,217
What do you need
to sort out these discrepancies?

140
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:39,016
- Time.
- We can't hold him more than 48 hours.

141
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,020
I know the law.

142
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:48,237
48 hours.

143
00:10:57,835 --> 00:11:01,251
OK. You got it. 48 hours
before I give his name to the media.

144
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:02,086
OK.

145
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,461
I don't get it. You confront a kid
that age with what he's done,

146
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:07,385
they give you something,
a chink in the armor.

147
00:11:07,554 --> 00:11:10,341
- What happened?
- I pushed his buttons.

148
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:12,424
Tried to intimidate him.
Everything I could.

149
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,890
Usually, they get defensive.
Or quiet.

150
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,897
Their mind starts racing but
he exploded like a powder keg.

151
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,190
Who gets angry like that?

152
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:21,640
- Someone innocent?
- Right.

153
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:25,687
- Maybe someone planted the evidence.
- What? Partial prints, a hair?

154
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:28,866
A lot of trouble to lead us to
a suspect with an airtight alibi.

155
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:32,414
Or is it airtight?
I mean none of it makes sense.

156
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:35,037
Maybe it can make sense. Maybe.

157
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,626
Yeah? Explain.
And you can stay my new best friend.

158
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:44,045
Marco was born
in a fertility clinic. Take a look.

159
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,378
I compared the samples
you sent with my own files.

160
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:51,181
You have the right man
but you also have the wrong man.

161
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:54,974
- I don't catch your meaning.
- A clinic is not a hospital.

162
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,523
We are not just
delivering babies here.

163
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,315
We happen to create pregnancies...

164
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,441
And how does this relate
to my suspect?

165
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,103
He's one of the pregnancies
we helped bring about.

166
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:06,615
- So you have identified him?
- We have identified them.

167
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,863
Your lab sent me these samples
from the suspect in your case.

168
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:18,287
And this is a match
with our file on Birth Client CM884.

169
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,458
Okay, CM...

170
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:27,587
Caucasian male, number 884.
File date 10/12/83.

171
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,093
Currently this man
is 24 years of age.

172
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:32,180
Marco Soler. I follow.

173
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,060
Looks like this is your man.

174
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:37,932
Except Marco Soler
wasn't born from his natural mother.

175
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:40,311
He was an embryo
from our donor pool.

176
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:42,525
That led me to this discovery.

177
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:46,612
Birth Client CM167,

178
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:49,360
file date 8/22/1973.

179
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,998
A second perfect match.

180
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,617
You're telling me our guy's a twin?
- Correct.

181
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,337
An identical monozygotic twin.

182
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:59,879
At one point these two
shared the same embryo.

183
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:02,627
But they're born
more than ten years apart.

184
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:05,136
Let me explain how things
were done here back then.

185
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,973
Starts with the normal procedure.

186
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,858
We extract the client's egg,
fertilize it.

187
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,483
Early in the embryo's growth stage
we simply cut it in half

188
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:22,902
creating identical
monozygotic or 'twin' embryos.

189
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:26,580
One embryo
is then implanted in the mother.

190
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:30,372
The second is frozen
at minus 180 degrees Celsius

191
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:33,498
so it can be used
in case the first embryo fails.

192
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,668
That way clients get two chances
from the one egg extraction.

193
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,260
Cost reduction is substantial.

194
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:42,384
Unused embryos were released
and, with consent,

195
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:44,217
placed into our donor pool.

196
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:47,139
So you see it's very possible.

197
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:49,596
Twins, ten years apart.

198
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:52,312
One carried to term
by the host mother,

199
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:56,145
the other, from the donor pool,
carried to term by a different woman.

200
00:13:56,696 --> 00:14:00,860
I need everything on this birth
client, CM-167 and his mother.

201
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:04,321
Mr. Brindle specific information
about our clients is confidential.

202
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,828
I don't think you understand
the importance of all this.

203
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,744
But it's a matter
of our client's rights.

204
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,159
Your clients rights?

205
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:12,377
I'm a little more interested
in the victim's rights.

206
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:15,254
Let me show you my file

207
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,339
on your 'birth client'.

208
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,330
- Hey.
- Good to see you again.

209
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:53,458
Your Pizza. Large Cheese.
- OK. Thank you. Here.

210
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:58,340
- No. Keep it.
- Thank you, see you.

211
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:00,053
Bye.

212
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:20,702
Elena?

213
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,699
- Hey.
- Hi.

214
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,709
Sorry,
I probably should've called...

215
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:33,044
No. No, it's...

216
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:37,050
- It's lovely to see you.
You too.

217
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:46,439
- And who's this?
- This is Henry.

218
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,601
Thought I'd bring
an office warming present

219
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,405
that might live longer than flowers.

220
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:59,115
Never was good with flowers.
Or goodbyes for that matter.

221
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,413
Makes two of us.

222
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:08,880
Not there.

223
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,915
It's a Beta fighting fish.

224
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:15,214
If it sees it's own reflection,
it'll go crazy trying to attack it.

225
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:17,179
Charming.

226
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:22,262
- So where's this Marco now?
- He's still locked up.

227
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,356
I'm gonna arrange to get him released
once I clear with the agency.

228
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:26,809
Of what?

229
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,565
I think he could be useful to us,
to the investigation.

230
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,071
Don't know.

231
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,785
I wanted to.
See what you think.

232
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,296
Twin behavior
isn't my speciality, but...

233
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,004
I can tell you twins
who grow up together

234
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,135
they tend to individualize more,

235
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,980
they try to be their own person.

236
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:03,056
By contrast
twins who are raised apart

237
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:06,069
they often exhibit
startling behavioral similarities.

238
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,488
Favorite foods, hobbies,

239
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:13,242
even strange,
coincidental things, I don't know.

240
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:15,654
Like driving
the same make of car or...

241
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,740
marrying people with
the same names...

242
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,374
- So mostly superficial similarities?
- Not always.

243
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:25,960
But I've never heard of a case
like this... different ages.

244
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:30,423
So you're gonna build a profile

245
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,221
of the killer from this younger twin?

246
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,594
How accurate would it be?

247
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:38,559
If you knew their family histories,
it could be very accurate

248
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:40,474
but it's never been done.

249
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:45,647
Will you help me?
See Marco a couple times a week?

250
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:47,151
I don't know, Tom.

251
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:52,232
People here complain about homework,
not homicides and...

252
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:58,041
All those nightmares
I used to listen to.

253
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:01,584
They crept into my sleep too.

254
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:06,674
You don't have to be directly
involved with the investigation.

255
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:09,514
But Marco is. And I need
to know that he can handle it.

256
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:18,517
What's his situation like?

257
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,855
Well his adoptive parents

258
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,942
were killed when
he was twelve. Train crash.

259
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:28,489
He went into the Army
a couple of years ago.

260
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:32,619
He's had his problems:
issues with authority.

261
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,414
Assault, anger...

262
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:38,750
- Like his brother?
You tell me.

263
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:52,560
You okay?
Yeah.

264
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:56,689
No.

265
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,187
It's surreal, you know?

266
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,703
Yesterday
I was in the Army, easy life.

267
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:14,913
And suddenly you come
and tell me I'm some killer.

268
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,881
And now you're telling me
I was created in a lab

269
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:21,835
and I have a twin
ten years older than me?

270
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:23,884
Who likes to play
dress up with dead girls...

271
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,839
Am I supposed to be OK?

272
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:31,263
Please, sit down.

273
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:35,018
Marco, please.

274
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:50,832
All we want to do is run some tests.
Create a psychological profile...

275
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:55,206
You want me
to be some sort of lab rat?

276
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:56,709
Of sorts.

277
00:19:57,215 --> 00:20:00,050
Agency would like you
to see Elena twice a week.

278
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,096
You mean therapy? Therapy with her?

279
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:08,557
It's not as formal as that, Marco.

280
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:13,353
Just a way of making sure you're
comfortable with your involvement.

281
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:17,858
No. You mean to make
sure you're comfortable.

282
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,319
Well.

283
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:27,158
You know, Marco.

284
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:30,951
I've talked to your superiors.

285
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,701
And they have
told me they would

286
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:36,788
give you a leave
of absence from the army.

287
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:39,797
As long as you were helping us
we'd give you a corporate apartment

288
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,512
right here in Barcelona.

289
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,299
And if it happens that you

290
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:46,348
help us find this killer,

291
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:50,101
we can look
into a possible honorable discharge.

292
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,980
You can get me out of the Army?

293
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:55,607
I sensed that's
something you'd like.

294
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:13,244
You want a lift?

295
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:17,047
I live in San Jose.
Sure you don't mind?

296
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:19,258
- It's on the way.
- OK.

297
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,428
- How are you?
- Fine.

298
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:26,808
Yeah?
- Habit.

299
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:31,348
Stop!

300
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,841
Character and
personality assessment.

301
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:36,919
What the fuck is this?

302
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:42,763
You experience emotions intensely?

303
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:46,640
You see beauty in things
where others might not?

304
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:51,229
<i>... details and the identity of
the former suspect's release</i>

305
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:52,644
<i>are being protected.</i>

306
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:56,317
<i>Authorities did tell us however,
that he is fully cooperating</i>

307
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:59,329
<i>and may have special knowledge
which could prove helpful</i>

308
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:01,074
<i>in catching Pygmalion.</i>

309
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:05,667
<i>Coming up we'll have the latest
sports news with Chris Rutthefort...</i>

310
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:09,420
<i>But now we go over to Gloria Sanchez
with the latest weather details.</i>

311
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:10,999
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

312
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:13,757
<i>A high pressure system
has moved into the area...</i>

313
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,657
- How are you doing there, Marco?
- I filled these out.

314
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,954
Just leave it on the desk. It's fine.

315
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:31,714
That's our evidence board.

316
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:38,432
It helps to have everything
all laid out. All in one place.

317
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:41,146
You see all together.

318
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:45,236
If you look at it long enough
you start to think about

319
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:47,730
some other
things in different ways.

320
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:52,401
- This is our case?
Yes, that's the case.

321
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:55,785
Four killings
with striking similarities.

322
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:59,951
All the victims
have severe patterned scarring

323
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,160
on the torso.

324
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:05,582
Victims have similar red dresses.

325
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:09,800
He kills them, cleans them,

326
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:13,010
dresses them and then moves them.

327
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:19,432
Then, he places them
so they can be observed

328
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:21,974
from outside a window.

329
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:26,732
The blood spots and
splattered evidence indicates

330
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:29,612
the action of his blade.

331
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,286
He's right handed just like you.

332
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:36,698
Don't they fight back?

333
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:39,538
No, I don't think they fight back.

334
00:25:39,713 --> 00:25:42,085
I don't think they have a chance
because he drugs them.

335
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:45,841
An intravenous injection
in the carotid artery.

336
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:50,379
A very fast combination
of a coagulant and a sedative.

337
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:52,634
The sedative puts them
in a comatose state,

338
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:56,262
the coagulant, thickens the blood,
so they bleed slowly.

339
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,558
We haven't identified
the sedative yet.

340
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:00,732
Tom,

341
00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:04,148
- Got a minute?
- Sure, what?

342
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,451
Good news, bad news.
We tracked down the mother.

343
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:12,033
It's all right. I mean...

344
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:14,830
If you don't tell him now,
I'll tell him later. Marco.

345
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,495
Well, I just got
the records from downtown.

346
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:21,089
It's about your biological mother,
Isabel Luna.

347
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:23,715
You sure?
- I didn't know her.

348
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:28,929
She died in 1984. Cancer.
She was forty-one.

349
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:30,887
We have her last address there.

350
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:34,186
Sorry kid.

351
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,316
Well, I don't know if that's
the good news or the bad news.

352
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:41,353
What else you got?

353
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:45,659
I checked Child Services
for a Roberto Luna. Nothing.

354
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,865
Well, we need to...

355
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,412
maybe get her old address.

356
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:58,003
Find the landlord. Try to track
that down. Get a medical record.

357
00:26:58,174 --> 00:26:59,834
- That sort of thing.
You got it.

358
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:14,596
Come on. Let's get you started.

359
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,857
All right. Right this way.
Here we are.

360
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:20,770
This is Bonilla.

361
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:25,073
Marco, Bonilla is gonna be
sticking you with needles all day.

362
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:27,534
Call me Paz.

363
00:27:28,248 --> 00:27:30,075
Now, to build our profile
all we need to do

364
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,658
is use all your physical
and personal data.

365
00:27:33,003 --> 00:27:36,040
Paz here analyzes blood, DNA, urine

366
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:40,379
to help us identify any propensity
for disease, genetic anomalies...

367
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,136
If you're likely to have diabetes,
a stigmatism, allergies,

368
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:46,390
we can track the killer
through any prescriptions

369
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,802
or medical procedures
he may have had.

370
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:52,890
Then I'll compile all your raw data
to generate aged mug shots.

371
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:56,568
Yeah. Big brother gets bigger.

372
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:01,523
Marco, why don't you head over
to the scan machine there

373
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:02,946
and look straight ahead?

374
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,579
- Tom, is all that necessary?
- Don't worry.

375
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:09,949
It's gonna be fine. Just relax.

376
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,664
- Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit.
- There. Just relax.

377
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:20,127
Tom, could you please close the door
and turn off the lights for me?

378
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:22,179
Thanks.

379
00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:26,092
Just relax.

380
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:29,637
Look straight ahead, please.

381
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:40,153
Just try to stay still.

382
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:48,992
- Why is he so anxious?
- I don't know.

383
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,005
He's been that
way since we met him.

384
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,352
Excuse me.

385
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:07,055
I'm looking for the Gaspar building.

386
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:09,934
- Psych?
Yeah.

387
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:12,904
- I'm going right by there...
- Thanks.

388
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,694
That way?

389
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:20,156
- So. You a grad student?
Yeah, well no...

390
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:21,819
I was in the Army.

391
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:24,245
Now I'm looking for something new.

392
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:25,616
- Oh yeah?
Yeah.

393
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:28,205
It's a great place to study.

394
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:31,084
I'm doing a year abroad
here from the US.

395
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,628
Are you thinking about
coming here too?

396
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:37,298
Yeah. You know?
To be honest,

397
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:41,265
I'm thinking about it
a little more every step we take.

398
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:47,264
No. It's been a while
since I've had options.

399
00:29:48,443 --> 00:29:51,527
All this is beautiful and you know...

400
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:53,649
What do you study?

401
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:59,239
Educational psych, crisis counseling,
you know... that sort of thing.

402
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:02,956
Hopefully
one day I'll work with kids.

403
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:08,245
- Kids? They are great.
Yeah.

404
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:14,381
Well, this is it.
You know where you're going?

405
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:16,133
Yeah. I'll find it.

406
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,049
- I guess I better go.
- What's your name?

407
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:20,806
- Kate.
- Kate?

408
00:30:20,978 --> 00:30:23,018
- Kate. Marco.
- Nice to meet you.

409
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:26,854
Nice to meet you.
Do you want to see a movie tonight?

410
00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:28,516
No. I'm working.

411
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:29,692
Yeah?
Yeah.

412
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,489
- Where?
- Kitty's pub.

413
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:34,064
- Maybe I'll come by. OK?
- OK.

414
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:52,094
Hey! Hi, Marco. Please, come in.

415
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:55,966
You can sit anywhere you like.

416
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:00,601
Everything okay?

417
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,398
I don't know how to start?

418
00:31:07,154 --> 00:31:07,984
You know what?

419
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:12,525
Let's go
somewhere else for today.

420
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:16,370
We can grab some coffee
down the hall and talk?

421
00:31:17,164 --> 00:31:18,078
OK.

422
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:27,875
You know I've done this before.

423
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,555
You mean therapy?
Yeah. Therapy.

424
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,094
A lot of people get worried
for you when your parents die.

425
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,555
People need
to feel useful, I guess.

426
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,392
Let me level with
you about something,

427
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,772
maybe you can
be straight with me.

428
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:52,070
I'm here because you're
a potential liability to Europol.

429
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:56,326
When they have their man in custody,
you're free to go.

430
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,824
This case will end,
but you have to continue on.

431
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,956
I've worked on homicide cases.

432
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:11,135
You're going to do and see
things here you won't easily forget.

433
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,010
And I want you to feel
free to talk to me.

434
00:32:16,354 --> 00:32:17,350
To let me in.

435
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,649
Do you think you can do that?

436
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:23,482
Because

437
00:32:23,904 --> 00:32:27,569
otherwise we're just
having coffee. That's it.

438
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:31,239
Yeah, I can do that.

439
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:34,697
Let you in.

440
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:37,499
Okay, good.

441
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:41,624
That way I can feel useful.

442
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:10,234
Yes. Don't worry.
OK. Wait a second.

443
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:13,658
- Hey.
- Hey. Please come in.

444
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:19,582
Yeah. Listen.
We have lunch tomorrow?

445
00:33:21,383 --> 00:33:23,460
OK I call you and tell you.

446
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,839
Yes. Have some wine.

447
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:29,887
No, not with you...

448
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:32,727
OK. I'll call you.

449
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:39,525
Yes. Kisses.

450
00:33:39,695 --> 00:33:41,937
I love you, Bye.

451
00:33:44,784 --> 00:33:47,405
Your mother?
You're good.

452
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,834
So, let me guess.

453
00:33:54,628 --> 00:33:56,786
You told her
I was coming over and...

454
00:33:58,215 --> 00:34:02,047
And... Let's say
there's some mixed feelings

455
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:04,633
though she did say hello.

456
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:08,849
That's nice. That's a start.
To new beginnings.

457
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:15,812
Have a seat, please.

458
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,398
How did the meet go with Marco?

459
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:27,528
Good but...
He's holding on to a lot.

460
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,657
And I'm just not sure
he wants me pulling it out of him.

461
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:34,671
But that's what you do, people
come to you with their secrets and...

462
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:37,497
But he didn't come to me,
we came to him.

463
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,457
That's true.

464
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:43,219
How's he doing with you?

465
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:47,139
The psychological tests gives us
a geographical profile of the killer.

466
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,884
He's good with his hands,
a mechanic, so...

467
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,645
We're looking at the places
where the killer struck

468
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:56,106
and compiling
lists of possible garages

469
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:59,814
that maybe his brother worked at
and it's a long shot but...

470
00:35:00,158 --> 00:35:03,527
- But it's all you've got?
Yeah. It's all I got.

471
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:15,164
- So it is quite a place.
Yeah.

472
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,922
You live alone.

473
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:29,720
Don't play the detective, please.

474
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:41,025
So, Elena,

475
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:44,569
why did you leave Europol.

476
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:46,742
What would I have stayed for?

477
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:50,795
For me. I just needed some time.

478
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:52,631
Why didn't you ask for it?

479
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,876
I understood what
you were going through.

480
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:58,303
Yeah? What?
From a clinical point of view or?

481
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:02,139
No. From a human standpoint.

482
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:05,014
Don't do that. If you're going
to push me away again, then...

483
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:07,974
I didn't mean like that. I'm sorry.

484
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:12,267
OK? I'm sorry.

485
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,022
- That's not what I mean.
- Ok.

486
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:19,275
It's just what
was going on then and I...

487
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:22,867
You lost a wife.

488
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:28,287
I know it can't compare but...

489
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,333
I did lose someone too.

490
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,519
I hope not forever.

491
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,710
- Don't be silly!
- A glass of champagne?

492
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,087
The honeymoon's
not over 'til sunrise.

493
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:12,958
This stinks.

494
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:15,259
Oh, yeah. What is that?
It must be the rats again.

495
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,368
I was looking for you.

496
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,581
Really? Seems that you're looking
for something else as well.

497
00:37:48,007 --> 00:37:50,795
They haven't seen anything
like this in over a decade.

498
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:51,965
People are scared.

499
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:55,922
I was hoping that perhaps
we can put a mock-up of the killer

500
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,385
on the evening news tonight.
Show we are narrowing in?

501
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:02,229
Is that what we are doing?
Narrowing in?

502
00:38:04,776 --> 00:38:07,812
Whatever. It just helps
to take the pressure of it.

503
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:10,156
It puts the public at ease.

504
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:13,607
Is that him?

505
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:17,745
Sure. It's him.

506
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,657
Or try that one?

507
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:24,284
Maybe glasses,

508
00:38:24,756 --> 00:38:28,125
maybe 300 pounds
overweight from some tyroid defect.

509
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:31,303
You want to sell the public
some illusion, just say so.

510
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:35,640
But until
we have corroborating witnesses

511
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,261
and a profile that is legitimate,
it's all smoke and mirrors,

512
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:41,348
it's not gonna make sense.

513
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:44,181
What is
this profile of Marco telling us?

514
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:45,310
To be cautious.

515
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:49,486
I don't want Roberto knowing that
we are getting close.

516
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:50,903
He'll change his patterns.

517
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:53,484
He already has, Tom,
he's killing in shorter cycles.

518
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:55,496
He's gonna make a mistake.
They all do.

519
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,201
I know they always do.

520
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,536
We haven't got time
to wait for that mistake.

521
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:00,873
You know the way the public reacts...

522
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:04,379
Number five. Castelldefels.
Early morning, about 4 a.m.

523
00:39:04,591 --> 00:39:07,592
Couple arrived from Greece.
Discovered a body in the house.

524
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,126
Don't use any of those.

525
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:11,720
Damn.

526
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:38,500
Come in.

527
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:15,532
- Did you tell Marco to come here?
- No.

528
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:25,043
I'd say she's
been dead for four days,

529
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:31,720
Marco, outside!

530
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:34,934
You have the same DNA as the killer.
What are you doing?

531
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:38,440
You could contaminate the scene.
Impersonating an officer?

532
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,611
So. I guess it all started here?

533
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:45,741
The owners were away on honeymoon,
he had a three week window.

534
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,864
- How long she's been dead?
- Four days.

535
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:51,122
- What?
- Four days, I heard it.

536
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,034
All right. Fine. Four days.

537
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:56,376
So he revisits
Nadine Villon on the third in Cannes.

538
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:58,713
Within few days he abducts another.

539
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:01,463
We need to find out
who knew they were leaving.

540
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:04,128
They were on their honeymoon.
Everyone knew!

541
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,135
Look, he bleeds her for
a few days up here

542
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:10,559
and after he's done amusing himself,
he brings her downstairs, right?

543
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,395
Why not leave her here?

544
00:41:13,899 --> 00:41:16,520
Because he likes
to put them on display. All right?

545
00:41:16,693 --> 00:41:19,185
Most serial killers they either
hide them or they bury them.

546
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:20,359
He's different.

547
00:41:20,656 --> 00:41:23,610
- Maybe he thinks he's an artist.
- No. It's just...

548
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:25,279
it's something else.

549
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:29,118
He's got some kind of emotional
connection with the killing itself

550
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,248
or some kind of association
with his past.

551
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:34,502
He's trying to recreate
something here.

552
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:37,459
- I think he's resentful.
- Explain that.

553
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:40,298
He's sticking it
in the face of the rich.

554
00:41:40,803 --> 00:41:43,128
That's how he got his name.
Pygmalion.

555
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:46,971
Pygmalion.

556
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:06,324
How was she murdered?

557
00:42:29,106 --> 00:42:30,102
Marco!

558
00:44:32,782 --> 00:44:35,867
You okay? Come on. Let's go.

559
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:38,699
- What was he doing there?
- I didn't know it.

560
00:44:38,872 --> 00:44:42,787
- The pursuit was bad luck.
- He could have been killed.

561
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,961
The kid handles himself well.
He's got a real feel for this work.

562
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:49,796
Let's call human resources,
and start the paperwork.

563
00:44:50,343 --> 00:44:53,712
Apparently, we don't have enough
people if the killer's still free.

564
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,305
People don't just vanish.

565
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:58,551
We're missing something,
something obvious.

566
00:44:59,395 --> 00:45:02,728
There's something that
we haven't figured out. It's just...

567
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:06,898
Long time since
I had to worry about you.

568
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:11,115
You wanted to bring Elena
into this case, fine.

569
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,108
You pulled some strings
so Marco is involved, I say okay.

570
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:19,993
But you're pushing it. Girl number
five is lying in the morgue.

571
00:45:22,712 --> 00:45:25,583
Reassure me, Tom.

572
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:30,469
The kid's fine. Really.

573
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:33,797
I'm fine.

574
00:45:42,817 --> 00:45:45,604
So you feel a connection
to this man, your brother?

575
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:50,815
I...

576
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:54,743
I don't know what to feel.

577
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:59,076
I mean wonder sometimes
what kind of life he had.

578
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:02,830
Because if we'd grown up together
things would be different, for sure.

579
00:46:04,758 --> 00:46:06,964
What compelled you to go
to the crime scene?

580
00:46:09,012 --> 00:46:12,263
I just wanted to see... to know why.

581
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:15,600
To know something.
All the people speak about him and...

582
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:20,270
I don't know.
They say this guy is sick.

583
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:26,228
You know what makes
him want to do that to women?

584
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,069
Somebody knows?

585
00:46:28,992 --> 00:46:31,281
A killer's desire
for possession and control

586
00:46:31,453 --> 00:46:34,573
manifest obsessively
in violent behaviour.

587
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:39,247
With most of them
it starts out early in childhood.

588
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,543
Yeah. I know.
I was speaking with Tom,

589
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,669
and he called it
the rethoric of excuse. But come on.

590
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,462
Lot of people
got a fucked up childhood.

591
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,007
I think that's not an excuse.

592
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,099
Tom believes, as well as I do,

593
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:54,600
that killers are created, not born.

594
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,013
What do you think?

595
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,398
I can't speak
for the killers of the world.

596
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,939
- But you've been violent before.
- OK.

597
00:47:06,784 --> 00:47:10,651
My file says I have a lack of
impulse control, that what you mean?

598
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:13,328
- Do you?
- I think I'm in control.

599
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:18,127
Yeah, but to a degree
you can relate to your brother.

600
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:19,998
His propensity for violence.

601
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:22,296
No. It's not the same.

602
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,799
All I did was strike a superior.
That's all.

603
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:26,672
- A woman.
- A woman?

604
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,970
From day one she'd been ridin' me.

605
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:32,683
Criticizing my skills,
exercises, everything.

606
00:47:33,438 --> 00:47:35,561
One day, all I saw was white.

607
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:39,105
Something took over
in me and I let it.

608
00:47:40,696 --> 00:47:42,854
I let it. Just like this.

609
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:47,775
Goes in the file.
Aggressive guy. No impulse control.

610
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:54,621
You want to know
why the does what he does.

611
00:47:57,464 --> 00:48:01,082
Does it give you answers
to your own aggressive behaviour?

612
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:11,263
Victim is Alejandra Sol, age 23.
She's from Alicante.

613
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:14,856
Her roommate says she doesn't know
anyone in Castelldefels.

614
00:48:16,735 --> 00:48:20,069
He takes her from Alicante

615
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:21,652
to Castelldefels.

616
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:25,654
He risks quite a bit of exposure
moving her that distance.

617
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,994
I mean the guy is all over the map.

618
00:48:28,164 --> 00:48:31,284
Our geographical profile
on him is practically useless.

619
00:48:32,836 --> 00:48:36,252
These are girls that have gone
missing in the last few weeks

620
00:48:36,423 --> 00:48:38,582
and fit the profile of victims.

621
00:48:41,136 --> 00:48:44,802
I think we should release the photo
likenesses we made from Marco.

622
00:48:44,974 --> 00:48:47,097
The runner
in Castelldefels was our guy.

623
00:48:47,602 --> 00:48:49,595
He obviously saw Marco.

624
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:52,941
Maybe we can turn
the invisible man visible again.

625
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:54,646
That's a good idea, yeah.

626
00:48:54,818 --> 00:48:57,653
Release to law enforcement,
no media, no public, obviously.

627
00:48:57,821 --> 00:48:59,565
How about the mother?

628
00:49:00,032 --> 00:49:02,108
The Landlady's going to meet you
in the morning at the apartment.

629
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:03,993
- Right.
- Paz.

630
00:49:04,454 --> 00:49:06,031
Do you know anything
more about the sedative.

631
00:49:06,414 --> 00:49:09,451
Still drawing blanks.
Here's Isabel Luna's medical file.

632
00:49:13,463 --> 00:49:15,088
Are you kidding me?

633
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,751
She lost her lung to cancer.

634
00:49:22,723 --> 00:49:23,589
Bingo.

635
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,262
What do I have to do to get
a beer in this place?

636
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:06,847
You can show up for one.
What happened to your eye?

637
00:50:07,522 --> 00:50:09,432
Oh no, that's nothing.

638
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:13,894
Take this. I'll be right back.

639
00:50:28,086 --> 00:50:30,293
You may not remember
but there was a woman

640
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:34,083
who lived here
in the early-eighties. Apartment 3E.

641
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:37,463
- Named Isabel Luna?
Yes, of course.

642
00:50:37,638 --> 00:50:40,212
Saddest creature
that happened into this building.

643
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,468
- Moved in when she'd lost her job.
- What'd she do?

644
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:48,350
Worked with horses,
bred them I think...

645
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:51,142
no, a groomer, in Tossa de Mar.

646
00:50:52,697 --> 00:50:55,781
Can you imagine going
from Tossa de Mar to this hole?

647
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,618
You knew about her cancer?

648
00:50:59,496 --> 00:51:02,201
All over. Spread to her brain.

649
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:04,244
She lasted less than a year.

650
00:51:06,003 --> 00:51:08,790
- And her little boy.
- Roberto?

651
00:51:11,008 --> 00:51:14,508
Brave little soul, he was
the only one to take care of her.

652
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:18,588
Shopped, did laundry,
got her drugs for the pain.

653
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:21,015
Did you ever help them financially?

654
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:26,017
Once or twice I may have given
them something but...

655
00:51:26,775 --> 00:51:30,726
- I think it was some other family...
- Wait. Sorry.

656
00:51:30,905 --> 00:51:33,859
Was there someone who visited?
We aren't aware of other family.

657
00:51:35,618 --> 00:51:37,243
I never saw any visitors.

658
00:51:40,123 --> 00:51:44,121
It's mostly gutted apartments now,
we are tearing it down in two months.

659
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:48,668
- We can go up if you like.
Yes, if you don't mind.

660
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:56,473
She died February 1984, right?

661
00:51:57,392 --> 00:51:59,136
One of the coldest on record.

662
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,355
That's how come
we didn't know she was gone.

663
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,728
- What do you mean?
You don't know?

664
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:11,275
People complained of hearing
Roberto crying on and off for days.

665
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,694
When we opened the door,

666
00:52:14,452 --> 00:52:17,572
there she was,
laid out on the bed.

667
00:52:17,956 --> 00:52:19,866
The cold had stifled the smell.

668
00:52:21,627 --> 00:52:23,952
What do you mean laid out?
She was "laid out"?

669
00:52:25,631 --> 00:52:27,873
It was the red dress he put her in.

670
00:52:28,718 --> 00:52:30,841
I guess he wanted her to look nice.

671
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:35,172
Red dress.

672
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:38,558
Yes, he was lying next to her.

673
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:47,275
Excuse me.

674
00:52:54,913 --> 00:52:57,369
Álvarez, Tossa de Mar.
Look for every

675
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,542
horse breeder in operation
in the late seventies and eighties.

676
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,170
Look for any classified ads

677
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,871
on jobs for horse care and grooming.

678
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:07,172
Competition horses,
you know things like that.

679
00:53:09,012 --> 00:53:09,676
Yeah.

680
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:14,472
Oh my God, he was her whole world.

681
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:17,258
And she was his.

682
00:53:20,524 --> 00:53:22,564
Child services has no record of him?

683
00:53:23,277 --> 00:53:24,820
We're still checking.

684
00:53:25,113 --> 00:53:27,153
He might have run away
when the body was taken.

685
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:30,657
But he was ten years old,
someone must've taken care of him.

686
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:31,825
Yeah.

687
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,998
Marco's life has a similar tragedy.

688
00:53:38,794 --> 00:53:41,582
Marco has a great deal of...

689
00:53:42,006 --> 00:53:46,170
interest in his brother like,
I don't know,

690
00:53:46,511 --> 00:53:50,094
he was this horrifying
reflection of his own life.

691
00:53:50,432 --> 00:53:53,932
It could follow that Marco's brother
would also be curious about him,

692
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:55,259
if he knew.

693
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:01,766
If he knew...

694
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:05,987
That's interesting. If he knew.

695
00:54:08,035 --> 00:54:09,066
Could be useful, Marco.

696
00:54:09,244 --> 00:54:12,578
We could use
him to draw Roberto out.

697
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:17,538
Discuss it with Marco first...
If that's what you decide.

698
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,423
- This is a dangerous game.
Yeah.

699
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,670
- So, Marco, you come here a lot?
- No, not exactly.

700
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,306
- Hey you!
- Hey.

701
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,342
I wondered if you'll come back.

702
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,012
I was trying to build mystery.

703
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:36,392
- Well you did. And who's that?
- He's just my boss.

704
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:39,399
- Tom, Kate.
- Hi.

705
00:54:41,238 --> 00:54:43,563
Sorry, we're slammed.
What can I get you, guys?

706
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:45,361
- Do you want a beer?
- Sure.

707
00:54:45,534 --> 00:54:47,242
- OK, a couple beers.
- OK.

708
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:48,402
Thanks, babe.

709
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:55,327
- I know why you wanted to meet here.
Yeah.

710
00:54:55,628 --> 00:54:58,629
Listen, Tom, about yesterday

711
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:00,791
I know I wasn't supposed
to show up like that.

712
00:55:01,676 --> 00:55:02,590
Don't worry.

713
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,553
So it won't affect our arrangement?

714
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:10,057
No, No. I spoke to your superiors
and your discharge should be OK.

715
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:14,391
You know you should
consider getting into police work

716
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:16,475
- when all this is said and done.
You think?

717
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:19,771
- Sure.
- OK. Make me an offer. Yeah...

718
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:24,826
No, you know, Tom,
I got some plans of my own.

719
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:28,703
Maybe apply to university.
Make a better life for myself than...

720
00:55:28,873 --> 00:55:31,079
- than in the army.
- A student.

721
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,370
Yeah. Why not?
I was thinking about it and...

722
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:37,416
I can be like Kate.
Walk her to her classes.

723
00:55:37,632 --> 00:55:40,206
Carry her books
and all of these things.

724
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:44,594
Marco,

725
00:55:46,392 --> 00:55:50,176
Elena thinks that Roberto
may try to contact you.

726
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,558
Even try to harm you.

727
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:54,441
- Harm me?
Yeah.

728
00:55:54,693 --> 00:55:55,357
Why?

729
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:59,068
He kills like most serials,
out of need and habit.

730
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:02,940
And he takes pleasure in hunting
and killing his victims.

731
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,569
And the only thing that takes
him out of that behavioral pattern

732
00:56:05,746 --> 00:56:08,866
is if he feels that his existence
is being threatened.

733
00:56:12,212 --> 00:56:14,703
If he knew who I'm
and I'm working with you?

734
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:18,666
Exactly. He may look
at that as an act of betrayal.

735
00:56:18,844 --> 00:56:20,469
And that might
help us to catch him.

736
00:56:28,313 --> 00:56:32,227
Okay, the ad reads: Horse Groomer,
part-time, Tossa de Mar.

737
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,188
Competition experience a must.
Call for interview...

738
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:39,741
Well, this paper is
the August 22nd edition, 1983.

739
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:43,988
Isabel Luna's lease
in Valencia is dated a week before

740
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:46,114
these people placed
the ad for a groomer.

741
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:49,000
This has to be the job she lost.

742
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:52,211
- Get me a name.
- Right.

743
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,137
Years ago you
had a woman named Isabel Luna

744
00:57:09,441 --> 00:57:11,564
working for you as a groomer?

745
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:14,606
Yes, she trained
my horse for competitions.

746
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:18,400
Young Ms.
Luna. Was quite the beauty.

747
00:57:18,951 --> 00:57:22,285
- Such a tragedy, that illness.
- Is that why you let her go?

748
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,614
Was it affecting her ability to work?

749
00:57:24,999 --> 00:57:27,076
No, she never let on.
My wife, you know,

750
00:57:27,252 --> 00:57:30,621
was not a terribly happy woman.

751
00:57:30,797 --> 00:57:34,712
- She fired Isabel.
- Were you two?

752
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:35,715
No. No.

753
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:39,304
I'll admit, I was tempted,
but there was nothing between us.

754
00:57:40,058 --> 00:57:43,012
It was only after Isabel had left

755
00:57:43,353 --> 00:57:45,346
I learned of her condition.

756
00:57:46,314 --> 00:57:49,897
She had a son.
A young. Roberto was his name.

757
00:57:50,068 --> 00:57:52,524
- Do you remember him?
Yes, nice boy.

758
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:57,446
Do you know what happened
to him after she passed away?

759
00:57:57,952 --> 00:58:00,408
No. As I said,
I only found out after.

760
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:06,370
You don't have a picture
of them, do you?

761
00:58:15,638 --> 00:58:17,761
- Good night
- I thought I was alone.

762
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:19,755
Good night, Santi.

763
00:58:42,793 --> 00:58:43,955
Forgot something?

764
00:58:44,378 --> 00:58:48,127
Another late night? Playing God
must be a taxing trade, right?

765
00:59:26,215 --> 00:59:27,246
Yeah. Hello.

766
00:59:29,093 --> 00:59:31,252
Yeah. Wait. What time is it?

767
00:59:32,555 --> 00:59:35,556
Yeah. Ok. I can come in.

768
00:59:36,685 --> 00:59:40,350
One hour? OK.

769
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,514
Sorry sweetie. I woke you up.

770
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:49,322
- Don't go...
- I have to. I have to work.

771
00:59:50,617 --> 00:59:54,697
But I'll be right back
in a couple hours, OK?

772
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:56,738
OK.

773
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:01,460
I'll just conserve my energy
for when you get back.

774
01:00:03,047 --> 01:00:07,175
OK. I like that. Get back to sleep.

775
01:00:18,188 --> 01:00:19,599
FREEDOM

776
01:00:19,773 --> 01:00:22,858
The fire destroyed
most of the freezers and banks.

777
01:00:23,778 --> 01:00:26,020
They put it out before
the maternity wing burned.

778
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,528
There was also a message.
"Freedom".

779
01:00:33,205 --> 01:00:36,325
Marco, we're gonna have
to get you a security detail.

780
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:41,251
Freedom. Freedom.

781
01:00:42,048 --> 01:00:43,542
Maybe he means the unborn?

782
01:00:45,343 --> 01:00:49,127
They don't have to enter into
this shit world... they're free.

783
01:00:51,516 --> 01:00:53,593
What are the sounds you hear now?

784
01:01:00,568 --> 01:01:02,027
What are you trying to block out?

785
01:01:04,781 --> 01:01:06,359
Don't do that.

786
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,358
- Marco, I'm just trying to help you.
- Come on. Come on.

787
01:01:09,536 --> 01:01:12,703
You're all trying to decide
if I'm going to be like him.

788
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:15,993
I have his DNA,
his habits, his likes.

789
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:18,958
Why not his anger, his obsessions?

790
01:01:20,423 --> 01:01:23,045
- It's not like that.
- Isn't it?!

791
01:01:25,804 --> 01:01:26,468
Isn't it?

792
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,560
If I wasn't like him,
what the fuck am i doing here?!

793
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:35,976
Don't you see
how different you are, Marco?

794
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:38,015
Come on.

795
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,104
Marco, there are things
outside of genetics

796
01:01:44,282 --> 01:01:46,026
that shape a person's character.

797
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:50,706
Things were different for me,
but not necessarily better.

798
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,071
And you know that.

799
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,001
So you want to say it's fate?

800
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,918
It's all genetic so you have
the excuse to be violent?

801
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,089
Your DNA is the same, yes,

802
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,052
but there
is what's called gene expression.

803
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,136
What genes?
What do my genes 'indicate'?

804
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:14,353
It doesn't matter,
Marco, it's a choice.

805
01:02:18,862 --> 01:02:20,107
And you have to make it.

806
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:32,997
Sorry, sorry.

807
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:36,244
- Sorry.
- OK.

808
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:38,581
- I'm tired.
- It's OK.

809
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:43,011
<i>- Brindle.
- Hey, it's me.</i>

810
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:45,263
How is it going with Marco.

811
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,267
That's exactly why I was calling.
I'm worried about him.

812
01:02:49,729 --> 01:02:53,312
I really think this
case is starting to get to him.

813
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:57,316
<i>- Isn't that the idea?
- Marco is a person with many issues</i>

814
01:02:57,696 --> 01:03:00,365
<i>and I really think you should
consider what this is doing to him.</i>

815
01:03:00,866 --> 01:03:04,567
<i>- I'm just not sure he can handle it.
- Listen, listen, Elena.</i>

816
01:03:04,745 --> 01:03:06,323
<i>I know this is difficult staff,</i>

817
01:03:06,497 --> 01:03:09,451
but really, don't worry about Marco,
I got him under control.

818
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,867
<i>- He's gonna be fine.
- I don't know.</i>

819
01:03:13,463 --> 01:03:17,543
Could we maybe
meet tonight and talk about it?

820
01:03:18,051 --> 01:03:20,803
<i>- I'll make dinner...
- Dinner? Tonight?</i>

821
01:03:23,098 --> 01:03:24,427
That's gonna be a little difficult.

822
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,807
<i>I think I'm gonna be here pretty
much most of the night.</i>

823
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:30,062
About Marco, I'll go over there
and see if he's all right.

824
01:03:32,066 --> 01:03:34,736
- Thank you.
- We can do dinner tomorrow night.

825
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:40,110
- OK. If you can fit me in.
- I'll bring the wine.

826
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:43,409
- All right.
- Don't worry. OK?

827
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:46,409
Everything is gonna be all right.

828
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:06,434
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you gonna sleep with me?

829
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,438
Please. Please.

830
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:19,064
I just came by to see
how you're doing.

831
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:22,324
I'm fine, OK. Don't worry.

832
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:25,367
Not sure
if i like the bodyguard, OK?

833
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:29,910
I feel like I can't even fuck
without everybody knowing about it.

834
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:34,880
Don't worry.
It's a necessary precaution.

835
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:39,343
It's temporary.
Just to make sure you're safe.

836
01:04:41,893 --> 01:04:44,300
I'll tell you what. I'll have
the bodyguard stay in the hall,

837
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:46,685
so that you can have your privacy.

838
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:49,106
OK.

839
01:04:55,574 --> 01:04:59,489
By the way, I've been meaning
to give this to you.

840
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,287
I'm not sure if you want it but...

841
01:05:02,874 --> 01:05:04,783
Nonetheless, here it is.

842
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:09,085
She's pretty.

843
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,465
- She worked with horses?
Yeah.

844
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:15,293
Must have been nice.

845
01:05:16,806 --> 01:05:20,056
That's him? Pygmalion?

846
01:05:24,439 --> 01:05:28,437
Marco, I think the message
he left at the fertility clinic...

847
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:32,026
I think it was intended for you.
Freedom.

848
01:05:32,197 --> 01:05:34,819
I think that he was trying
to let you know that he has it.

849
01:05:36,285 --> 01:05:38,859
Freedom
to indulge his desires, to kill...

850
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:40,785
You sure?

851
01:05:44,252 --> 01:05:46,162
He wants me to be like him?

852
01:05:47,548 --> 01:05:48,579
You're not like him.

853
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:53,794
You ever wonder

854
01:05:56,057 --> 01:05:58,180
if you deserve to be happy?

855
01:06:00,729 --> 01:06:01,594
Sure,

856
01:06:04,149 --> 01:06:06,521
and you wonder if you're
capable of making others happy?

857
01:06:09,738 --> 01:06:10,853
Like Elena.

858
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:15,198
No. Elena was...

859
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:17,451
She was one among the people

860
01:06:17,914 --> 01:06:21,081
at Europol who
tended to the flock, as it were.

861
01:06:24,505 --> 01:06:27,541
My wife and I were apart,
most of the time

862
01:06:28,926 --> 01:06:32,093
and I pretty much left the marriage

863
01:06:33,848 --> 01:06:36,256
about a year before I even met Elena.

864
01:06:36,434 --> 01:06:40,598
But you know... That's all
rationalization for the affair.

865
01:06:42,357 --> 01:06:43,686
Kind of pathetic.

866
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:47,946
What happened?

867
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:51,357
Well you know... About year into it,

868
01:06:53,703 --> 01:06:55,281
I tried to

869
01:06:56,081 --> 01:06:59,699
find the right time, the right way

870
01:06:59,876 --> 01:07:01,668
to tell my wife.

871
01:07:03,756 --> 01:07:04,586
Did you?

872
01:07:05,174 --> 01:07:07,546
I didn't have to, as it turns out.

873
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:11,381
I remember just a perfect night.

874
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:15,091
We went for this great evening walk,

875
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,264
we went out we got some groceries,
made this amazing dinner together.

876
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:20,597
She laughed
at something stupid I said...

877
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,564
just a great day and a great night.

878
01:07:30,201 --> 01:07:32,823
And I kissed her good night...

879
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:39,534
next morning, she was gone.
She had a brain aneurism.

880
01:07:40,754 --> 01:07:42,035
She never woke up.

881
01:07:42,673 --> 01:07:45,247
- I'm sorry.
- But the hardest part

882
01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:48,755
I had to accept about myself

883
01:07:50,223 --> 01:07:53,557
was that at the funeral,

884
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:58,226
with all this people
hugging me, crying...

885
01:08:00,025 --> 01:08:00,855
As bad as it was.

886
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:04,562
I couldn't help but feel
this deep seated sense of relief.

887
01:08:05,198 --> 01:08:07,523
'Cause i had been denying
for so long who I was.

888
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:09,826
And her death set you free.

889
01:08:45,075 --> 01:08:46,450
You're wonderful.

890
01:08:50,372 --> 01:08:51,321
Great.

891
01:09:23,783 --> 01:09:24,815
It's OK.

892
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:30,411
<i>I need you
to rerun our sedative</i>

893
01:09:30,582 --> 01:09:32,492
<i>through
the pharmacological databases.</i>

894
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,454
You'd just be spinning your wheels...

895
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,706
Check veterinarian medicine.

896
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,332
<i>You're looking for a horse sedative</i>

897
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,418
possibly used for grooming

898
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:42,924
<i>maybe surgery.</i>

899
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:45,050
- I'm on it.
- Right.

900
01:09:48,811 --> 01:09:50,009
OK. Here we go.

901
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:53,261
It's an Alpha-2
Agonist called Clonodine IV.

902
01:09:53,733 --> 01:09:56,402
And he's got to be using large
doses since it's meant for a horse.

903
01:09:56,569 --> 01:09:58,728
Drugs affect the brain,
body mass doesn't factor.

904
01:09:58,905 --> 01:10:02,239
And we've got approximately
five times the brain mass so...

905
01:10:02,617 --> 01:10:05,405
Five times the dosage.
That will help us

906
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,989
track down
the purchases, anyway.

907
01:10:08,165 --> 01:10:10,205
Start within
the geographical profile.

908
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:12,167
We're looking
for large shipments.

909
01:10:12,503 --> 01:10:15,208
- We're closing in, Tom.
Yeah. I hope so.

910
01:10:15,423 --> 01:10:17,795
Why don't you go
and get some sleep for once?

911
01:10:18,093 --> 01:10:19,089
We'll keep working.

912
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:25,468
You're right. I'm actually
having dinner with Elena tonight.

913
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:29,392
I said get some sleep,
not get someone to sleep with.

914
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:35,436
All right.
You two think you're funny?

915
01:10:35,737 --> 01:10:38,857
Honestly, Tom. I didn't even know
Álvarez had a sense of humor.

916
01:10:39,157 --> 01:10:40,901
I just found out myself.

917
01:10:43,996 --> 01:10:46,154
- If we get something we'll call you.
Yeah.

918
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:57,417
Elena?

919
01:10:59,513 --> 01:11:00,426
Elena!

920
01:11:01,974 --> 01:11:02,804
Elena!

921
01:11:13,612 --> 01:11:15,403
No. No!

922
01:11:16,281 --> 01:11:18,570
No! No!

923
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,946
No!

924
01:11:24,749 --> 01:11:25,911
No! Come on.

925
01:11:31,005 --> 01:11:32,630
I'm sorry.

926
01:11:44,645 --> 01:11:46,722
I'm sorry.

927
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:19,840
That's all? Great.

928
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:23,516
I've taken a photo.

929
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:42,412
- How are you holding up?
- Just give it to me, Álvarez.

930
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,621
Are you sure?

931
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:51,623
Well it's the same M.O.

932
01:12:51,802 --> 01:12:54,839
Large laceration from
her abdomen to her breasts.

933
01:12:56,515 --> 01:12:58,674
Puncture wound on her neck,
same pattern.

934
01:12:59,978 --> 01:13:02,350
Found blood in the shower
and splattered stains

935
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:04,314
where she was most likely murdered.

936
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:08,024
They are now doing
a sweep for prints and...

937
01:13:10,155 --> 01:13:12,029
I did this to her.

938
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:16,577
- I'm sorry?
- I did this to her.

939
01:13:19,999 --> 01:13:21,826
She wasn't doing
this kind of work any more

940
01:13:22,002 --> 01:13:24,956
and I convinced
her to come onto the case and...

941
01:13:27,299 --> 01:13:30,253
- I did this...
You can't blame yourself.

942
01:13:31,846 --> 01:13:33,554
He did this to get to me.

943
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,602
He's a predator. He's a killer.

944
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:45,854
She's innocent. I just...

945
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,856
I'm responsible
for getting her killed.

946
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:58,580
Take it.

947
01:14:01,545 --> 01:14:02,375
Take it.

948
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:08,084
Yeah?

949
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:17,057
Ok.

950
01:14:18,313 --> 01:14:19,392
Tom, that was Paz.

951
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:23,939
She run initial R and the name
Luna in any orders for Clonodine 4

952
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:26,068
those names in the last two years,

953
01:14:26,864 --> 01:14:29,236
nothing popped up until

954
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,117
she run Martin's holding company.

955
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:36,329
A Large quantity of that
sedative was bought a year ago

956
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:37,994
and sent to a P.O. box.

957
01:14:38,585 --> 01:14:39,748
Under what name?

958
01:14:40,879 --> 01:14:42,539
Roberto Rosa.

959
01:14:43,507 --> 01:14:45,251
That Martin lied to us.

960
01:14:52,308 --> 01:14:54,978
I want him in cuffs
by the time I get there.

961
01:14:57,606 --> 01:14:58,519
All right.

962
01:15:05,948 --> 01:15:07,491
- Where's Roberto?
- I don't know.

963
01:15:07,867 --> 01:15:09,824
You knew all along.
You helped him.

964
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:13,328
You have to understand.
He was like a son to me, an orphan.

965
01:15:13,498 --> 01:15:15,123
- I did what I could...
You did?

966
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:18,328
Like teaching about
horse sedatives to drug women?

967
01:15:18,712 --> 01:15:21,168
I didn't know what
the shipments were being used for.

968
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:24,341
You knew we were looking
for him and you didn't say anything.

969
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:26,384
You lied to us! Where is he?!

970
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:28,921
He comes and goes.
I haven't seen him in months.

971
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,635
Comes and goes?
Comes and goes, where?!

972
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:32,552
Where does he live?
Where does he go?

973
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,304
He was so young
when his mother died.

974
01:15:36,815 --> 01:15:38,891
What was I suppose to do?
I felt responsible.

975
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:41,939
You're responsible for
the death of seven women.

976
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:43,109
Dead because of you.

977
01:15:43,322 --> 01:15:45,399
You're just as guilty as him.
You're an accomplice.

978
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:47,618
Unless you start talking
I'm gonna make sure

979
01:15:47,786 --> 01:15:50,787
you're put in a hole
for the rest of your fucking life.

980
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,370
He lives in Ibiza.

981
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:56,243
- I can give you an address.
- Good.

982
01:16:20,363 --> 01:16:21,109
Let's go.

983
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:28,658
We got a body here!

984
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:04,989
7, 8, 2, 2, 2.

985
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,782
7, 8, 2, 2, 2.

986
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:15,422
7, 8, 2, 2, 2.

987
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:25,761
Ávarez! What is Marco's
corporate apartment address?

988
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:28,592
Seventy-eight? Floor?
Twenty-two.

989
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:31,730
The apartment number? Two?

990
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:34,307
7, 8, 2, 2, 2.

991
01:17:35,987 --> 01:17:37,232
Get somebody there now.

992
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,720
Where are you going? Bro?

993
01:18:13,736 --> 01:18:14,768
We finally meet.

994
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:18,071
What do you?

995
01:18:23,372 --> 01:18:25,246
<i>Tom, he's gone.</i>

996
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,419
<i>We found the security guard
covered in blood in the stairwell.</i>

997
01:18:28,586 --> 01:18:30,958
He is ICU now so he can't talk.

998
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:34,708
<i>No signs of Marco, no forced
entry into his apartment.</i>

999
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:39,681
Tom. Tom.

1000
01:18:40,599 --> 01:18:42,675
<i>- Tom?
Yeah. I'm here.</i>

1001
01:18:44,812 --> 01:18:46,639
<i>Did you Id the girl
from the apartment?</i>

1002
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:51,020
Her name is Ana Llorca,
worked for a local pizza place.

1003
01:18:51,569 --> 01:18:53,692
<i>Apparently made
a few deliveries to his address.</i>

1004
01:18:54,114 --> 01:18:58,064
We also found a jeep registered
under the name Roberto Rosa.

1005
01:18:58,410 --> 01:18:59,739
<i>We are trying to locate it now.</i>

1006
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,612
<i>We're not sure if he keeps it
on the island or the mainland</i>

1007
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:04,866
<i>to get from one
crime scene to the next.</i>

1008
01:19:05,251 --> 01:19:07,921
<i>It's a lot of ground to cover
but we'll fucking find him, Tom.</i>

1009
01:19:08,379 --> 01:19:12,377
- No, you won't.
- What? Are you alright?

1010
01:19:14,094 --> 01:19:15,672
He's not using a car.

1011
01:19:18,933 --> 01:19:20,925
- He's using a boat.
- What?

1012
01:19:21,227 --> 01:19:24,928
Castelldefels. Cannes, Tossa De Mar,

1013
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,183
Alicante, lbiza...

1014
01:19:29,402 --> 01:19:33,021
- He's using boats.
- Jesus!

1015
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:36,825
<i>That's how he's able to move around
so easily from place to place.</i>

1016
01:19:37,036 --> 01:19:38,744
Listen we go with
our original premise

1017
01:19:38,913 --> 01:19:41,748
that he's a mechanic,
only he's not a mechanic on cars,

1018
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:42,947
he's a mechanic on boats.

1019
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:47,202
We should check out the houses
where he put the victim's bodies

1020
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:50,796
and see if those people
who own the houses also own boats.

1021
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:52,426
Where they get them serviced

1022
01:19:52,594 --> 01:19:54,338
<i>and if there is
some connection there.</i>

1023
01:19:54,513 --> 01:19:55,924
This guy knows something,

1024
01:19:56,140 --> 01:20:00,268
he knows when they are on vacation,
or honeymoon, or something...

1025
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:01,558
OK, got it.

1026
01:20:47,654 --> 01:20:51,735
- Make you feel eighteen again.
Yeah.

1027
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:56,287
I'm told the best day in a boat
owner's life is the day he buys one.

1028
01:20:56,456 --> 01:21:00,619
And the day he sells it.
Question is, which day is it for you?

1029
01:21:01,586 --> 01:21:03,912
Juan Martín got me hooked on these.

1030
01:21:04,548 --> 01:21:06,706
You know I sold him his first boat?

1031
01:21:07,426 --> 01:21:10,261
And Roberto got a job here.

1032
01:21:10,638 --> 01:21:13,674
Yeah. He's been working
for me for four years.

1033
01:21:14,308 --> 01:21:15,553
Is Roberto here today?

1034
01:21:16,519 --> 01:21:19,354
He's in a job in Nice.
I don't think he'll be back today.

1035
01:21:22,025 --> 01:21:22,689
You sure?

1036
01:21:27,948 --> 01:21:29,359
Let's talk.

1037
01:21:29,992 --> 01:21:32,530
Of course I understand.
I know you're right. Okay?

1038
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:34,907
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry about that.

1039
01:21:35,248 --> 01:21:38,831
I'll get someone out there first
thing in the morning, OK? Sorry.

1040
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:43,378
- He never showed.
- What boat is he using?

1041
01:21:43,549 --> 01:21:45,126
We'll track him using GPS.

1042
01:21:45,342 --> 01:21:47,418
Keep some of your guys
in here just in case.

1043
01:21:47,845 --> 01:21:50,799
Notify everybody that's in the water,
port authorities should be on alert.

1044
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:54,425
Get me an helicopter here.
Get a position on it?

1045
01:22:13,414 --> 01:22:16,202
Mom, look who's here,

1046
01:22:16,376 --> 01:22:18,748
mom, look who's here.

1047
01:22:22,341 --> 01:22:23,372
It's mom.

1048
01:22:30,183 --> 01:22:30,847
Our mother.

1049
01:22:42,154 --> 01:22:43,530
She was week.

1050
01:22:44,949 --> 01:22:46,740
Maybe it wasn't her fault, ok?

1051
01:22:49,329 --> 01:22:50,609
But that's what she was.

1052
01:22:51,498 --> 01:22:54,784
She didn't care how,
she just wanted a child.

1053
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:59,921
Here we are,
because of one woman's whim.

1054
01:23:00,132 --> 01:23:01,330
What do you want with me?

1055
01:23:03,302 --> 01:23:06,506
I just wanted
to talk to you, Marco.

1056
01:23:10,393 --> 01:23:11,674
To see you with my own eyes,

1057
01:23:12,604 --> 01:23:15,309
to see my brother before
your people hunt me down.

1058
01:23:15,732 --> 01:23:18,105
They're not my people.
They arrested me.

1059
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,736
They forced me into this. I...

1060
01:23:20,154 --> 01:23:21,317
I know.

1061
01:23:23,991 --> 01:23:27,990
- Why do you do it?
- It gives me pleasure.

1062
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:31,035
Marco, you are never more
alive than when you take a life.

1063
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:35,789
She taught me my first
lesson about that. It's delicate.

1064
01:23:36,422 --> 01:23:38,628
It's beauty... It's... It's...

1065
01:23:39,175 --> 01:23:41,298
I think you know that, right?

1066
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:44,009
You've known since
they first told you about me.

1067
01:23:47,684 --> 01:23:51,433
Maybe even before that.
We're cut from the same stone.

1068
01:23:52,189 --> 01:23:54,941
They call you sick,
they call you deranged...

1069
01:23:59,989 --> 01:24:02,445
It's not sick.

1070
01:24:03,576 --> 01:24:05,616
Take it easy, please.

1071
01:24:06,621 --> 01:24:10,536
It's not sick,
it's not unnatural... it simply is.

1072
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:13,040
Don't tell me you
don't know how good it would feel?

1073
01:24:13,212 --> 01:24:15,964
When you take
that girl in your arms,

1074
01:24:16,424 --> 01:24:17,752
all her weakness,

1075
01:24:17,967 --> 01:24:20,637
her frail mind, her fucking whim...

1076
01:24:20,803 --> 01:24:22,214
and you devour it.

1077
01:24:23,223 --> 01:24:25,429
They can try
to purify our genes in the womb,

1078
01:24:25,684 --> 01:24:27,926
but they can't clean
the world we're born into.

1079
01:25:15,947 --> 01:25:17,110
Come on. Hurry up.

1080
01:25:23,288 --> 01:25:24,948
It's OK, bro.

1081
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:45,103
Guys, slow, let go first.

1082
01:25:55,657 --> 01:25:58,195
I had no choice.

1083
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:07,918
Take over.

1084
01:27:17,037 --> 01:27:19,707
Dear Marco Soler;
In answer to your

1085
01:27:21,209 --> 01:27:23,996
application of registration
in the University of Barcelona,

1086
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,792
I'm pleased to advise you at
this moment we're going over it

1087
01:27:26,965 --> 01:27:29,337
and we hope we'll be able
to give you a response soon.

1088
01:27:41,981 --> 01:27:43,179
Are you there?

1089
01:28:07,342 --> 01:28:08,457
Marco.

1090
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:12,509
Why don't you
answer your phone?

1091
01:28:14,517 --> 01:28:17,434
I've been trying to reach
you for hours. You all right?

1092
01:28:20,356 --> 01:28:21,767
Somebody else here?

1093
01:28:24,945 --> 01:28:27,697
Listen, I just came by

1094
01:28:29,158 --> 01:28:30,189
to give you this letter.

1095
01:28:31,285 --> 01:28:34,203
You're taking
the college thing seriously.

1096
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:36,654
Congratula...

1097
01:28:40,879 --> 01:28:41,625
What's this?

1098
01:28:44,549 --> 01:28:45,415
It's not mine.

1099
01:28:46,426 --> 01:28:50,259
- What?
- The blood. It's not mine.

1100
01:28:52,099 --> 01:28:54,092
Who's in the shower, Marco?

1101
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:00,434
That was my new life.

1102
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:03,482
University.

1103
01:29:05,739 --> 01:29:07,317
Regular girlfriend.

1104
01:29:09,744 --> 01:29:12,151
Regular job.
Working with you guys.

1105
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,335
I thought about it.

1106
01:29:19,004 --> 01:29:21,791
I really did but...

1107
01:29:23,509 --> 01:29:25,382
there was something inside of me

1108
01:29:28,305 --> 01:29:30,263
that still wanted to destroy it all.

1109
01:29:33,311 --> 01:29:34,805
And it wasn't just the killing.

1110
01:29:44,073 --> 01:29:45,650
You are a good student, Marco.

1111
01:29:50,747 --> 01:29:51,660
Cleaning her.

1112
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:02,592
Where were
you going to put the body?

1113
01:30:05,721 --> 01:30:07,264
I got tired Tom.

1114
01:30:09,058 --> 01:30:11,431
Tired.

1115
01:30:13,063 --> 01:30:15,518
You can't know what
it's like to feel these things.

1116
01:30:17,234 --> 01:30:18,728
I brought you into this.

1117
01:30:19,153 --> 01:30:19,935
When...

1118
01:30:20,613 --> 01:30:23,530
When you kill,

1119
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:31,415
it's... Time stops.

1120
01:30:38,382 --> 01:30:39,331
You don't get it.

1121
01:30:42,887 --> 01:30:44,547
It's in me, Tom.

1122
01:30:46,933 --> 01:30:50,100
It's inside of me
and it will never go away.

1123
01:30:50,395 --> 01:30:51,391
And you know what?

1124
01:30:53,607 --> 01:30:54,887
It's not my first time.

1125
01:30:56,902 --> 01:30:58,444
I was waiting for you, Tom.

1126
01:30:59,196 --> 01:31:03,029
I sat in Elena's office answering
question after question.

1127
01:31:03,201 --> 01:31:05,656
She was gonna help me, wasn't she?

1128
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,908
- She's dead.
- Shut up, Marco.

1129
01:31:16,131 --> 01:31:17,246
You want to know a secret?

1130
01:31:19,385 --> 01:31:22,588
I think right until the last minute
she thought you were gonna come,

1131
01:31:23,014 --> 01:31:25,470
- burst into the door and rescue her.
- Shut up!

1132
01:31:25,892 --> 01:31:28,051
She should have known
you weren't the most reliable lover.

1133
01:31:28,228 --> 01:31:29,141
Enough!

1134
01:31:30,981 --> 01:31:32,356
Shut the fuck up.

1135
01:31:34,652 --> 01:31:36,063
I'm gonna speak now, OK?

1136
01:31:38,114 --> 01:31:39,988
I couldn't get the perfect dress.

1137
01:31:41,034 --> 01:31:44,782
The sedative was a problem.
When the autopsy comes back...

1138
01:31:44,955 --> 01:31:45,986
Enough, Marco.

1139
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,746
Part of me wanted
to take it back but part of me...

1140
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:51,124
It's power...

1141
01:31:51,628 --> 01:31:54,499
It's freedom.

1142
01:31:55,591 --> 01:31:57,714
It's power to take. Pleasure.

1143
01:31:58,177 --> 01:32:00,466
It's pleasure to take
that vulnerability,

1144
01:32:01,181 --> 01:32:03,304
that trust.

1145
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:06,390
Is that what you saw in Elena?

1146
01:32:07,938 --> 01:32:10,939
No. That's what I found in you.

1147
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:14,485
That's what I found in you.

1148
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:17,528
OK, Tom.

1149
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,274
It's better if it's you.

1150
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:24,449
Put the gun down.

1151
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:28,084
I like the silence.

1152
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,919
Just put the gun down.

1153
01:32:34,383 --> 01:32:35,842
She told me I had to chose.

1154
01:32:36,928 --> 01:32:37,924
And I choose this.

1155
01:32:54,322 --> 01:32:55,187
Tom.

1156
01:32:56,616 --> 01:32:57,612
Freedom.
