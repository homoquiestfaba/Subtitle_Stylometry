1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:20,886
please welcome Lisa Lampanelli!

3
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,658
¶

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,496
Hello, New York! All right.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,634
Welcome to the best night

6
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:40,572
of your sad, pathetic
freakin' lives.

7
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,840
This is gonna be a great night

8
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,777
'cause not only am I hilarious,

9
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:47,246
you get to look at me
for over an hour.

10
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,248
Go ahead. Oh, yes.

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,084
Work, bitch.

12
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,619
No, I'm telling you,
you may have noticed

13
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,354
I made some appearance changes,

14
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:58,257
recently lost 107 pounds.

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,892
What!

16
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:03,629
"What'd you say? Ooh, 107.

17
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,065
She look good."
And here's the thing.

18
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,734
It's enough of an accomplishment
to lose that weight,

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,970
but I actually kept it off
for three freakin' years,

20
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:16,608
and I know,
that's the hard part, right?

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,012
And you know what?
I know you guys look at me

22
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:25,451
like a life coach,
a mentor, a role model,

23
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,852
and so I'll you
how I kept it off.

24
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,188
I don't hold
no freakin' secrets.

25
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,190
Listen to this shit.

26
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:37,696
If you learn to use bulimia
the right way--

27
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,398
Just eat stuff
that tastes as good

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,801
coming up as it did going down.
Just saying.

29
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,603
No, that actually
isn't even true,

30
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,139
but it's God's cruel joke
that I was ever freakin' fat.

31
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,775
It freakin' sucked,
'cause I was born skinny.

32
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:53,912
I wasn't born to be a fat cunt.
Guess what happened.

33
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,748
I hit 18,
everything went crazy, it did,

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,218
so I went every goddamn diet
in the world,

35
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,120
and let me tell you
all about 'em,

36
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,088
'cause they're all designed
to make us fucking failures

37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,824
and hate ourselves more,
this diet industry.

38
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,493
First of all,
that Weight Watchers,

39
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:11,396
they can lick my left clam,
okay?

40
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,498
Right?

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,566
And oh, my God, Nutrisystem?

42
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,703
Are you fucking kidding me
what that shit?

43
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,771
All I can say about Nutrisystem

44
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:24,877
is that Marie Osmond
is a lying freakin' whore, okay?

45
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,013
That boxed food tastes like
Mrs. Dog the Bounty Hunter's

46
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,483
snatch hole.

47
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,286
Ugh, and then this Jenny Craig.

48
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,888
Jenny Craig.

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,991
I tried that horrible program
twice, it don't work.

50
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,126
Maybe the reason
it don't work is 'cause

51
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,295
every time I go there,
the counselor who's trying

52
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,964
to make me lose weight
is still fucking fat.

53
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,833
Really?

54
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,536
Oh, okay, I'm gonna trust
a fat bitch

55
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,437
on how to lose weight.

56
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,506
Why don't I just
call up Bill Cosby

57
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,177
for some rape prevention advice?

58
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:02,981
Yeah, you can clap.
He's a raper. He is a raper.

59
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,517
But seriously, I wasn't even
supposed to be fat

60
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,818
during my life.

61
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,353
Oh, my God,
but I went away to college.

62
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,721
That's when it all started.

63
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,157
I was lonely. It's terrible.

64
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,493
I used food
for emotional reasons.

65
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,262
Some of you fat bitches
know what I'm talking about.

66
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,964
Look at this whore.
No, not by rubbing it

67
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,900
on your junk, bitch.
I'm talking about

68
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,870
you use it as a friend, and yes,

69
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,673
did I eat an ice cream sandwich
in the shower?

70
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,642
Yes, I did,

71
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,244
but I'm a freakin' lady.

72
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:35,247
The one time I ate
pork chops on the toilet,

73
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:39,785
I flushed those bones.

74
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,187
But college was hard, man,
and honestly,

75
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,323
I'm telling you only the truth
tonight about myself.

76
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:48,660
Okay, the worst thing
that happened to me in college

77
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:52,464
was the night
that I had a date rapist

78
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:57,469
who took no for an answer.

79
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:03,275
How unattractive must you feel
when the known rapist

80
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:06,178
you thought you could count on
just to stick the tip in

81
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,881
just a little after all
the sororities rejected you,

82
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,883
how must you feel
when that guy looks at his watch

83
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,418
and says, "Eh, you know what?

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,454
"It's kind of late.

85
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:20,192
Those joggers in the park ain't
gonna rape themselves, so--"

86
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,997
I'm like, "Come back,
Dr. Huxtable, come back!"

87
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,403
So honestly,
I struggle with my weight.

88
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,972
18 years old to 50,

89
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,141
and three years ago,
I said, "Fuck it.

90
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,744
I'm gonna save my own life."
'Cause let me tell you,

91
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,647
if I die, who the hell else
is gonna come out here

92
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,117
and call you all spics
and blacks and cunts?

93
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,820
Nobody's brave
like Lisa Lampanelli.

94
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,792
So here's what ha-happened.

95
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,260
I go to this doctor,

96
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,796
and he says he's gonna
do this operation

97
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,032
called the "gastric sleeve."

98
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,335
This means they cut out
85% of your stomach

99
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:09,107
so you can't eat like
you got ten rectums no more.

100
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,043
And of course
I get the funny doctor.

101
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,711
Like, this is the thing, man.

102
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,213
Okay, everybody's nervous
during surgery,

103
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,749
but my doctor thinks
he's hilarious.

104
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,552
He's one of them
Indian doctors, you know?

105
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,920
No, no, not the, you know,

106
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:26,525
laying in a curb drunk
by a casino Indian.

107
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,627
You know,
not the bad negotiating,

108
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,928
they'll take a fucking necklace

109
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,931
and give us Rhode Island
fucking idiots.

110
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,499
Feather-headed morons.

111
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,737
No, I'm talking about
that other type of Indians.

112
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,107
You know, the stinky
cow-worshiping guys.

113
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,544
Expedia.com thinks
a freakin' cow is a god.

114
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,845
Are you fucking kidding me?

115
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,182
So headset not headdress Indian.

116
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,921
So anyway, so it ends up,
I go for the surgery.

117
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,689
5:00 a.m.,
I get to the hospital.

118
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,191
I get all nervous.
I said to him,

119
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:03,328
"Listen, Dr. Apu,
I have a question.

120
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:12,471
"Can I get my stomach back
reinstalled

121
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:15,974
if I get hungry?"

122
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:20,879
And guess what he says.
He's like, "Oh, no, no, no, no,

123
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:25,350
"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

124
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:29,254
"my friend, my friend,
my friend, my friend.

125
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,690
"We're going to use
your stomach to cover

126
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:36,695
the infield at Yankee Stadium."

127
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:40,098
You know what's wild too?
Ever since I lost the weight,

128
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,968
every interviewer
starts with, "Oh, my God,

129
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,936
you must love the way you look."

130
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,671
Let me tell you something.

131
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,940
I'm 53 freakin' years old.

132
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:53,712
In clothes,
I'm clearly ridiculously hot.

133
00:06:55,615 --> 00:07:00,419
In clothes, I am
a tasty piece of ass.

134
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,723
However, out of clothes,

135
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,426
just like the rest
of you messes over 40,

136
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,996
I am freakin' horrifying.

137
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:14,599
No, people, I don't give a crap
if you were a supermodel

138
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,834
when you were in your 20s.

139
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,969
Right now, keep
your goddamn clothes on.

140
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,173
You make me fucking vomit.
I hate you.

141
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:24,709
Especially you men,
have some goddamn dignity.

142
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,344
Shower in a freakin' robe.

143
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,747
Spare your fucking
significant other

144
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,183
some stress and drama.

145
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,220
Because there's always
something wrong

146
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,389
with somebody's body over 40.

147
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,791
There's always,
like, a cellulite mass

148
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,626
bubbling around back there,

149
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:46,364
a freakin' varicose bumpy vein
threatening to pop all over TSA,

150
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:50,869
and then my flight
is fucking cancelled,

151
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:54,806
a stray cunt hair
flailing in the breeze.

152
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,245
Now, I make it a specific point

153
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:04,516
never to see myself naked
in a mirror,

154
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:10,622
just to preserve the shred
of self-esteem I have mustered,

155
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,158
but oh, my God.

156
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,827
Today, the hotel
they have me in,

157
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,564
that mirror snuck up on me,

158
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,468
and I caught a glimpse
of my naked, cellulite-y,

159
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,573
flabby, flat,
Howard Stern-looking ass.

160
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:33,478
It looked like I sat on a gravel
driveway naked for five hours.

161
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,581
Like, "Holy crap.

162
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,951
"Is that an ass or a relief map
of the Himalayan Mountains,

163
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,486
for God's sake?"

164
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,523
Now, here's the deal.

165
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:49,628
As you probably know,
'cause I'm quite famous,

166
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,531
I recently got a divorce
from my ex-husband,

167
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,268
Jimmy Big Balls.
It's okay, it's very amicable,

168
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,005
thank God,
and he also lost 98 pounds.

169
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,374
Now, the reason
I call him Jimmy Big Balls,

170
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,110
you might not know
if you're fucking stupid.

171
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,511
You can't put two and--

172
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,281
Okay, picture this guy's
freakin' head.

173
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:16,021
Imagine two of those in a pair
of Hanes tighty whiteys.

174
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,157
Actual size.

175
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,326
I mean, that sack, Jesus Christ.

176
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,295
It looked like
two little midgets

177
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:27,599
fighting their way
out of a pink, hairy parachute.

178
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,834
I hadn't seen anything
that big and hairy

179
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,971
since I gave Snooki a Pap smear.

180
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,342
But see, this is how I know
that God hates me.

181
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,345
Even though Jimmy loses
all this weight and looks great,

182
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:43,915
every time he lost an ounce,

183
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,520
it gravitated and it migrated

184
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:52,624
and eventually settled
in that fucking beanbag chair

185
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:56,461
of a nut sack
until he had to hold it up

186
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,965
when he took a shit
just in case.

187
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,804
And you know how I knew
it was big?

188
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,939
Oh, <i>Madone!</i> One day,

189
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,574
he's laying in bed naked,

190
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:13,478
and he goes,
"Hey, check it out."

191
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,846
I look, sir.

192
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:19,718
His ball was resting

193
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,455
on my side of the bed.

194
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,693
See, now, I try to be positive

195
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:34,099
'cause I'm a person who projects
much light and love,

196
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,701
and it was like,
"Oh, my God, wow!

197
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:41,906
At least we never have to buy
throw pillows again."

198
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,642
But you know what, folks?

199
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,044
Since I'm telling you the truth,
I will tell you this.

200
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,613
I think that is the night

201
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,516
that I knew the marriage
was not meant to be.

202
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:58,189
No, you laugh, but seeing,
um, that ball

203
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,326
on the sheet and, um,

204
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,629
the other one
on the nightstand was--

205
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,436
Now, like I said,
I am one lucky bitch

206
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,471
that I do not have
a nasty divorce,

207
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,708
and part of it I think is--
Is that we didn't have kids.

208
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,446
Now, black guy, are you a black
or a half spic, half black?

209
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:27,018
That would make you
six years a slave, my friend.

210
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,420
The gay guys
are getting worried.

211
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:33,191
"Oh, my God! Help us."

212
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,293
Okay, are you a black guy then?

213
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,828
Let me--
Oh, you're Jamaican.

214
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,230
Oh, that--okay.

215
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,167
No wonder this hot bitch
is with you, holy shit.

216
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,202
How many kids you got?
You got "keeds"?

217
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,838
You got "keeds," motherfucker?
You got "keeds"?

218
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,972
How many you got? Two?

219
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,341
Two, two, two, two, two, two.

220
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,877
Yeah, son. Yeah, son.

221
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,112
How old are your kids?

222
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,982
Four and ten? Is this their mom?

223
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,919
Of course not. Why would she be?

224
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:07,158
You don't want to mess
with fine traditions.

225
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,861
No, but hey, God bless you
for having those kids.

226
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,963
Divorce is hard
if you have kids,

227
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:16,401
but here's the thing.
I never wanted no "keeds."

228
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,636
I'm like the gift
to the world, you know.

229
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,238
I don't want you to be tied down

230
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,941
to only loving
two little fucking idiot kids

231
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,843
that I gave birth to.

232
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:28,513
I am a gift to you people.
I'm like all of your ma,

233
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,583
but here's the problem.
I'm sad now

234
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,984
'cause I'll never have
grandkids.

235
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,319
That makes me kind of sad.

236
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,121
Like, does anybody here
have grandchildren?

237
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,256
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

238
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,557
Sir, sir, do you love them?

239
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,092
- Is it so much fun?
- Yes.

240
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,727
Oh, my God.
It's got to be a blast.

241
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,530
Listen, all of yous,
when you have grandkids,

242
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,866
do what I would do
and I'm sure what this guy does.

243
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:51,703
You have them over to your house
for a nice sleepover,

244
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,372
and you spoil the crap
out of those kids,

245
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,741
and you get them
all hopped up on sugar.

246
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,677
They get whatever
they freakin' want,

247
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,014
and then you get 'em
their own first Starbucks,

248
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,583
'cause it's never too early

249
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,419
for the one-year-old baby's
caffeine.

250
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,989
It's a beautiful thing.

251
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,425
Then you keep 'em up all night
as a way of paying back

252
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,328
your ungrateful
piece of shit son

253
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,931
who married
that know-it-all cunt

254
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,599
that he met in medical school,

255
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,468
and she thinks
she's better than you

256
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,570
and wouldn't take no suggestions
for the wedding

257
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,305
'cause she's
so fucking high class

258
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,240
with the fucking house
in Martha's Vineyard.

259
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,276
Fuck that cunt.
She don't know it all.

260
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,844
You even made your dress
for the wedding,

261
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,480
and she didn't even put out
nice feelings for you

262
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,015
from the goodness of your heart.

263
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,819
Well, fuck that whore.

264
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,556
Yes, you return that kid
to them with no sleep,

265
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:47,392
hopped up on sugar,
and with a big shitty diaper.

266
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:51,729
That shitty diaper--
The shitty diaper is king.

267
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,199
The shitty diaper is the way
of sending a message

268
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:57,502
home to your son. "Aha!

269
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,405
"This is what you get
for hitting puberty

270
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:04,509
and jerking off
into Mommy's fur coat."

271
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,316
You know who hates that joke?
Lesbians.

272
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,984
Dykes hate that joke.

273
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,788
They're all into the environment
and these fucking animals.

274
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,023
Who gives a shit?

275
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,561
Minks and chinchillas were bred
to be worn by Lisa Lampanelli.

276
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:27,232
I--they love being killed
for me.

277
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,035
No, lesbians really do
hate that joke.

278
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,371
Oh, my God, I remember.
Oh, my God.

279
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:38,376
I once got an angry email
from some "lesbeen"

280
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,279
because I had had
a chinchilla coat made.

281
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,815
Now, by the way,
don't even think of booing

282
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,750
fur coats, okay,
'cause the only people

283
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,587
who boo fur, hello,
can't freakin' afford fur.

284
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,491
I will kill and wear anything.

285
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,260
I do not give a crap.

286
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:58,796
Hector, I will come
to your house,

287
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,900
take your five little
Chihuahuas, sew 'em together,

288
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,036
and wear 'em like
Cruella de Vil on a Wednesday.

289
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,171
I don't care.

290
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,744
Hey, I'll do you one better.

291
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:17,115
If your children have
an interesting skin tone,

292
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:22,553
I'll skin those little bastards
and rub the lotion on its skin.

293
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:26,324
Oh, my God, not even one moan

294
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,661
for killing children
and wearing them.

295
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:32,463
I think this is
my type of town, folks.

296
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,601
Party!

297
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,338
Now, I called you a Latino.
Are you Latino?

298
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,140
Oh, my God, 100%?

299
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,842
Yes, Papi Chulo.

300
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:48,346
What don't you do for a living?

301
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,983
That's so unfair.

302
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,918
There's black people behind you.

303
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,521
I find that fascinating.

304
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,423
Thank you.
Speaking of black people,

305
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,824
here's the deal.

306
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,794
I--now that I'm single--
Oh, my God.

307
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,596
Now that I'm single,
my whore friends are like,

308
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,900
"Oh, Lisa, you should go
out there, and get out there.

309
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,601
You're like a cougar."

310
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,671
People,
I'm 50-freakin'-3 years old.

311
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:17,675
That's too old.
Cougar cutoff is 49.

312
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,212
I'm not a cougar.
I just have an old pussy.

313
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,083
Bob Barker keeps
chasing it around

314
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,386
trying to spay and neuter
the freakin' thing.

315
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,256
But here's what ha-happened.

316
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,659
I don't know what type of guy
I'm supposed to date

317
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,427
right now 'cause think about it.

318
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,096
Before I married Jimmy,

319
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:42,133
I had actually enjoyed
the chocolate love.

320
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,768
It is well documented.

321
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,871
I had more black guys
behind me than Obama.

322
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,673
Yes, I did.

323
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,310
But now,
these freakin' black guys,

324
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,878
they won't look at me no more

325
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,613
'cause I lost weight,
and they don't like

326
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,148
that I have no fucking ass.

327
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,951
They don't like that,
'cause you know, Tyrone,

328
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,920
the blacks enjoy--

329
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,757
They like an ass
with its own address

330
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,327
so the welfare checks
will go to the right place.

331
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,498
But then I said to myself,
"Ooh, Paco,

332
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,902
maybe I should date
one of these illegals."

333
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,540
No.

334
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,308
Are you legally
in this country, sir?

335
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,376
Yeah.

336
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,482
No, I thought to myself,
maybe I should date a Latino,

337
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,984
but oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

338
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,852
That's a little risky for me,

339
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:38,656
'cause right now,
I'm a rich white woman,

340
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,059
and a rich white woman
dating a Latino, please.

341
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,860
That's like somebody
who adopts a pit bull.

342
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,964
At some point something's gonna
go horribly wrong.

343
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,569
So I thought, "At least
give everybody a chance,"

344
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,871
and I figured out
the only type of nationality

345
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:57,208
I never had a date with
was an Asian.

346
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,877
I know.
It was just an oversight.

347
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,914
It's easy to see
over those little

348
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,751
fucking flat heads
and squinty eyes.

349
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,220
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
I am not dating an Asian."

350
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,589
I'm sorry.
No--no offense, but I spent

351
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,225
so much effort
getting rid of my extra chins.

352
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:18,162
I am not inviting anymore in.

353
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:19,564
But that did seem racist,

354
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,032
so I said,
"You know what I'm gonna do?

355
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:25,436
I'm gonna check it out slowly.
Put a toe in."

356
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,905
Figuratively. Freakin' fags,

357
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,542
always go to putting
something in the ass.

358
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,711
I rented this porno,

359
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:39,016
and it was an Asian dude
with a white broad.

360
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,319
No.

361
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,820
It was way too scary.

362
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,389
Every time she said
she wanted it doggy style,

363
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,659
he whipped out a frying pan.

364
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,463
Somebody has to explain this
to you?

365
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,133
You fucking retard.

366
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,202
He goes, "I don't know.
I don't know."

367
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,038
They eat dogs.

368
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,541
Putting two and three together,
you fucking idiot.

369
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,377
Jesus Christ. What are you?

370
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,678
- Are you a Latino, man?
- No.

371
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,514
What are you, sir?

372
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:12,350
Half black, half white. Yeah.

373
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,252
Nice combo.

374
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,053
So he works part-time.

375
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,358
Very nice. Very good.

376
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,763
So who--who was black,
mom or dad?

377
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,599
Mom? What's your father's name?

378
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,068
Dwight. Isn't that impressive,

379
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,804
that he knows who his father is?

380
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,876
Shocking.
You're a nice guy, man.

381
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,311
What's your name? I like you.

382
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,613
Don, is this your white bitch
right here?

383
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,482
This your white bitch?

384
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,750
Who are you hanging on,

385
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,519
lesbian Flock of Seagulls
haircut?

386
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,921
Who am I to fucking talk, right?

387
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:54,692
Justin Bieber fucked Miley Cyrus
for this hairdo.

388
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,495
I like this crowd.
This is a really good crowd.

389
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,530
Here's what I'm telling you.

390
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,335
You know why I like you?
'Cause you get the jokes.

391
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:08,339
You're supportive.
Here's LL's deal.

392
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,575
I'm talking about myself
in the third person.

393
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,643
Yes. With initials.

394
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,579
How freakin' pretentious
is that shit?

395
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,480
Okay, here's how I roll.

396
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,584
I feel like
the biggest thing I hate

397
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,452
is when comics
come up on a stage,

398
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,088
they just get a divorce,
and then they're anti-marriage.

399
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,089
That's bullshit.

400
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,824
I think
marriage is a beautiful thing,

401
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,259
a wonderful thing,

402
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,761
and I plan to do it
at least three more times,

403
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,430
'cause I love weddings.

404
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,134
What I think is even great
is most of these states

405
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:40,171
are getting on the case
and legalizing gay marriage.

406
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,439
Isn't that fantastic?

407
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,245
I do not understand how people
can be against gay marriage.

408
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,446
Guess what I figure.

409
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,814
If they're against gay marriage,

410
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,183
they're big closet-case
dick suckers.

411
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,451
That's what they are.

412
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,653
Yup, they are deeper
in the closet

413
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:59,523
than Melissa McCarthy's
workout clothes.

414
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,025
Fuck you.

415
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:04,962
I can say it till I gain
my weight back in three years.

416
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,797
But honestly and from my heart,

417
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,700
I really feel like if,
as a gay person,

418
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:13,804
you are lucky enough
to find someone to spend

419
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,706
the rest of your life with,

420
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,308
you have every right

421
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,479
to be just as miserable
as us straight people are.

422
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,815
In fact, you know what?

423
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,183
I think tomorrow,

424
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:31,689
all 50 states
plus Guam <i>y</i> Puerto Rico

425
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,958
should legalize gay marriage,

426
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,962
but then the very next day,
they should outlaw gay divorce.

427
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,797
Ah!

428
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,099
You asked for it,
you got it, cornholers.

429
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,304
Good luck splitting up
that Crate & Barrel registry,

430
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,773
you dirty homos.

431
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,107
You too, lesbians.

432
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:53,277
Fucking go to Home Depot
and get your money back.

433
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,148
I've been thinking
about marriage a lot,

434
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,582
and I've been thinking,
do you know what?

435
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,218
I have noticed
the only two people

436
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,821
who shouldn't be allowed
to get married,

437
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,458
two freakin' ugly people.

438
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,961
Have you seen the travesty

439
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:15,199
that can result
from that unholy union?

440
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:19,303
I'll give you a nice little
illustration and a parallel.

441
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:23,641
Say two nice fags like them
get married.

442
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,409
They move in next door to you.

443
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,479
They have
a beautifully manicured yard,

444
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,614
a lovely organized toolshed

445
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:34,352
with the vibrators
in descending order.

446
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,987
All the little cock rings
are color coded

447
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:40,257
on penis-shaped pegs.

448
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:44,061
Pretty soon they adopt
a little Asian baby

449
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:47,398
'cause an Asian is easier to get
than a real kid.

450
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,604
Pretty soon,
around the neighborhood,

451
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:57,174
a dry cleaning establishment
pops up,

452
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,610
then a nail salon.

453
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,979
Then when she's 21, they buy her

454
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:07,017
her own happy ending,
rub-and-tug massage parlor.

455
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,652
What's the worst thing
that could happen

456
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,321
when two ugly people
get married?

457
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:14,892
Three words, Honey Boo Boo.
That's what can happen.

458
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,496
Honey Boo Boo's the worst.

459
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:21,832
Did you see how Honey Boo Boo's
mom was dating a pedophile,

460
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,634
and Honey Boo Boo's
so fucking unattractive,

461
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,737
that guy wouldn't even fuck her?

462
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,174
Oh, come on, man.

463
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,277
You ever notice fat kids
never get molested?

464
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,179
'Cause the guy never
has enough candy

465
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,982
to get the kid into the van.

466
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,521
You know what's funny?

467
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:46,157
My audience happens to always be
the coolest people,

468
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,758
'cause they can
really take a joke,

469
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,226
but, oh, my God.

470
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:52,396
In 25 years in this business,

471
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:55,900
I've only gotten protested
four times.

472
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,735
That's pretty freakin' good,
right?

473
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,270
I mean, hello.

474
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,772
The first time I got protested--
You can look it up.

475
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,441
This is absolutely true.

476
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:08,846
I got protested in Rochester,
New York, by deaf people.

477
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,719
Now, you laugh,
but you didn't have to be there.

478
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:20,491
Do you know how confusing

479
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:24,762
a protest by deaf people is?

480
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,599
I go up to the theater,
like, "Uhh!"

481
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:32,603
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
did you just say I'm pretty?"

482
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:38,542
Now, the other three times
I got protested

483
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:44,181
was by the most disgusting,
hateful group on the planet,

484
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:48,219
the freaks
at the Westboro Baptist Church.

485
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:49,820
- Boo!
- Thank you.

486
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,057
If you don't know who
the Westboro Baptist Church is,

487
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:57,628
first of all, I object to anyone
who calls themself a church

488
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,699
when the church has
nothing to do with love, God,

489
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,133
or spirituality.

490
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,535
It's all about hating
other people,

491
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,837
so don't use
the word "church," bitch.

492
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:13,878
They are actually a group
of 70 inbreds

493
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,546
in Topeka, Kansas,

494
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:20,818
who have three real teeth
and four slack jaws between 'em,

495
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,854
and they've developed
this disgusting hate website

496
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,357
called godhatesfags.com,

497
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,160
which is reprehensible,
except the name's really funny.

498
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,263
I wish I had thought of it,
personally.

499
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:39,770
Now, these Westboro inbreds
don't like Lisa Lampanelli

500
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,939
because I have some gay fans,

501
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:45,876
so I figured out
how to get those assholes back.

502
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,812
I decided to become

503
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:53,117
an ordained minister

504
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,952
and marry 20 gay couples

505
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,454
right in front
of their inbred eyes.

506
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,989
Oh, yeah.

507
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,992
Yes.

508
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,496
Isn't that great?

509
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:08,065
But sadly, I find out
right before I get there,

510
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:12,002
they don't have no fag marriage
over in Topeka,

511
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,038
so I had a better idea.

512
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,509
I ran into the theater,
gathered all the gays,

513
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:20,344
and we ran outside.

514
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:24,181
We stood 10 feet
from those sign-waving retards,

515
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:30,287
and we all had a big, huge,
gay make-out session,

516
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,457
with tongues and everything,

517
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:36,293
and we all chanted,
"We're here. We're queer.

518
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:37,995
One beer and you'll be here."

519
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:46,470
John Travolta was
right there beside us.

520
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:49,340
Oh, finally,
people are getting on board.

521
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:54,645
Travolta--Danny Zuko
is a fucking fag.

522
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,513
Please, are you kidding me?

523
00:26:56,515 --> 00:27:00,117
50 massage therapists
are not lying, all right?

524
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,455
Grease is the word for what's
up his freakin' butthole.

525
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,295
Now, gay guys,
if you ever get married,

526
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,630
do you want children?

527
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:13,931
Do you want kids? No, no.

528
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,399
Listen, man,

529
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,268
I have a maternal instinct,
though, about one thing.

530
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,205
I always wanted a dog.

531
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,641
No, I love a little dog.
No, do me a favor, though.

532
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,342
I'm gonna say this
in all serious--

533
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,244
If you want to get a dog,

534
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,480
don't be a douche bag
and go buy one.

535
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:33,450
You go to the North Shore
Animal League, another shelter,

536
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:36,520
and you adopt one
of these little homeless mutts.

537
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,289
They need a home.

538
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,091
Now, this is a win-win
for everybody.

539
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,760
Think about it.

540
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:47,264
If you buy a dog, that's like
1,500 clams at the least.

541
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,134
You adopt one of these scroungy
little homeless mutts

542
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,536
running around,
you don't like him in two days,

543
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,938
just put him right back
in the middle of the street.

544
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,276
Nobody knows nothing.

545
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,911
Just give it to the Asian bitch.

546
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:04,281
She'll cook it up with tofu.

547
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,983
It's like
when you adopt a little kid.

548
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,185
You're not really that attached
to that fucking kid.

549
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,587
He didn't come out of your clam.
You don't care.

550
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,356
Send him back to Russia
to hang out

551
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,291
with the other communists,
Ivan the Terrible.

552
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,827
I give a fuck less.

553
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,697
Oh, adoptees are here? Wah.

554
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,032
Yeah, you're special
'cause you were chosen.

555
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,636
That's what the Jews
thought too.

556
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:28,072
I joke, you know I love
my heebie friends

557
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:31,642
and accountants and lawyers.

558
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:36,513
So anyway, I adopted
the greatest dog in history.

559
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:37,681
Oh, my God.

560
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:40,084
I named him Parker

561
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:43,520
after Sarah Jessica Parker.

562
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:47,558
No, because of the really
astounding resemblance.

563
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,563
You know what, people?

564
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:56,667
I'm, like, really disappointed
in you right now.

565
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:01,105
Let me set the goddamn record
straight.

566
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:07,578
SJP does not look like a dog.

567
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,715
She looks exactly like a horse.

568
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,786
Okay, this is really mean.

569
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,254
I can't even believe I joke
about her, 'cause she is, like,

570
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,290
my hero of my whole life,
but okay.

571
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,626
Listen, listen, listen.
Don't tell her.

572
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:27,731
There's a website
that's literally called,

573
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:35,506
www.SarahJessicaParker
lookslikeahorse.com,

574
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,141
and they asked her
on a talk show

575
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,103
if she ever read it,
and she went--

576
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,082
And the host said, "Come on,

577
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,084
how many times
have you looked at it?"

578
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,252
And she went--

579
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,429
Anyway, my dog is awesome,

580
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,031
but see, you got to know
the rules.

581
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,533
Here's what you do.

582
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:05,068
The first thing you do
when you get your dog home,

583
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,471
you go onto the computer,

584
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:12,309
and you Google the words
"service vest."

585
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,978
Ah, she knows the scam.

586
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,580
This thing is a vest

587
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:19,817
that you get to put
on your little, rotten dog,

588
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,119
and you get to take him
anywhere you want,

589
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:27,825
and nobody's allowed to ask you
what the hell is wrong with you.

590
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:30,794
Somebody made the mistake
of asking me why I had the dog.

591
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:34,131
I said, "'Cause I'm retarded."

592
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,435
Now, honestly, your dog
doesn't even have to be helpful.

593
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:42,005
My dog seriously
doesn't do shit.

594
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:48,045
He is about as useful
as a Kardashian in a library.

595
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,415
Okay, I'm not gonna get
all derailed

596
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,383
and talk about the Kardashians,

597
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,152
but I am gonna say one thing
about them

598
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,154
that I'm pretty freakin'
pissed at.

599
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,556
They stole my whole game, okay?

600
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:03,360
I was banging the black guys
first, all right,

601
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,830
not those three hos.

602
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,533
And by the way,
they're freakin' hypocrites.

603
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,836
Their names are Kim,
Kourtney, and Khloé, KKK.

604
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,606
Why do you fucking guys
take the risk?

605
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,943
So anyway,

606
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:23,513
this vest you put on your dog,
you take him anywhere,

607
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,049
because it's frowned upon,
apparently,

608
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:30,687
to leave your dog in a car
with the windows rolled up.

609
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,256
And you--you don't want
to be late.

610
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:35,292
Like, black guy,
suppose you are late.

611
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:38,996
Well, that's a given.

612
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:42,132
But suppose you're late
for your appointment

613
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,800
with your parole officer.

614
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,240
Other black, suppose...

615
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,310
they're about to rerelease
the McRib.

616
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,648
Black people love ribs.
It's a fact.

617
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,417
It's not something I made up.
We all know.

618
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,722
Now, like I said,
my dog's useless,

619
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,491
but now that the airlines
are asking

620
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:10,460
for a little note
of what's your problem,

621
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:13,897
I had my shrink write me
the note of notes,

622
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,033
'cause, first of all,
he's a perfect combo

623
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,268
to be a good fucking liar.

624
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,840
He's spic and a fag,

625
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:27,811
so this guy,
Dr. Lopez or some shit,

626
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,013
Lopez-a-fag-corn.

627
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:36,420
He wrote on my note
that I need the service dog

628
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:39,756
because I have
a rare fainting disorder,

629
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:44,661
and my dog wakes me up if I'm
about to hit my fucking head.

630
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,596
Is that not
the best excuse ever,

631
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:52,102
combining the shifty Hispanic
with the creative fag in one?

632
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:54,871
But trust me, when you fly
on these airlines and--

633
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,840
Freakin' airline--
You know what, what the fuck?

634
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:59,042
Who's old here?
Sir, you on the end.

635
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,544
It's not an insult.

636
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:01,912
You're an older man.
How old are you, sir?

637
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,747
73. God bless you.

638
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,616
Means he ain't long
for this fucking world.

639
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,554
Sir, don't you resent--
Remember in the old days

640
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,956
when you'd fly and everybody
would get dressed up,

641
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,393
and it was like an actual thing,
and the stewardesses were sexy?

642
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,328
They were hot.
There was a weight requirement.

643
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,632
<i>Oy vey,</i> I had two goddamn
stewardesses on the flight.

644
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:27,070
Looked like Shrek One
and Shrek Two.

645
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,639
I'm telling you, they won't
help you with nothing.

646
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:33,276
They will not put your crap
in your overhead bin,

647
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:34,878
even if you're faking

648
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,649
a really authentic-looking
rotator cuff injury like I was.

649
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,752
Matter of fact, the only guys
who ever helped me,

650
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:43,253
the only stewardesses
who ever did put it

651
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:46,623
in the overhead for me,
were a gay stewardess, a man.

652
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,058
Those men will help you.

653
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
Right, faggot?
You're very helpful.

654
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:51,828
I know.

655
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,397
Gay men love doing that for you

656
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,564
'cause they're used to shoving

657
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:58,001
big things
into tiny little spaces.

658
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:04,374
So I know all the rules
about taking my dog on a plane,

659
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,610
but one day,
I have him in his little bag.

660
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,779
He starts barking. Now, come on.

661
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,615
Your heart's got to go out
to a pet like that.

662
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:13,683
Oh, because I turn
into a total queer

663
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,052
when I'm talking to my dog.

664
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,620
You guys would not
recognize me in private.

665
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:19,022
I'm like--

666
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:23,260
"Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

667
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:26,596
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?"

668
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,732
But then I turn that way,
and I can't turn it off,

669
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,654
and my gay friends come over,
I'm like--

670
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,671
"Who's a good faggot?
Who's a good cornholer?

671
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:37,507
Who's a good cornholer?"

672
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,509
And then they all
lick each other's asses,

673
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,478
so it's nice.

674
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,184
So my dog's barking,
the plane's trying to take off,

675
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:52,055
I feel bad for the passengers,
I put his little bag on my lap,

676
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:55,625
and then all I did was
I took his little head out.

677
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,127
It was so cute. I know, right?

678
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,529
He was looking around,
and then I took that zipper,

679
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:03,700
and I put it against
that goddamn larynx of his,

680
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,803
and I put my lips
to his little doggy left ear,

681
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:10,273
and I said,
"Shut the fuck up, Parker.

682
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,741
"Shut your fucking mouth.

683
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:14,211
"Mommy's a fourth level
fake-ass celebrity.

684
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,779
"Shut your goddamn mouth.

685
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,714
"I'll fucking kill you
in your sleep and feed you

686
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,351
"to that chinky lady
over at the fucking buffet.

687
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,719
Shut the fuck up."

688
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,289
So he and I
come to a nice understanding,

689
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,591
but then guess what.

690
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:31,027
Shrek One has to come up
and interfere,

691
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,563
and she's like,
"Uh, you have to put

692
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,433
the head of the dog in the bag."

693
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,935
People, I'm no terrorist,

694
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,571
so I'm not gonna yell
at some bitch on a plane,

695
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,173
but I just poked the dog
in his ribs.

696
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,641
I said,
"No, it's so he won't bark,"

697
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,545
and I poke him,
and he goes, "Ahh."

698
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:51,281
So she's being cool,
but guess what.

699
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,618
Guess who has to pipe up,
get in the conversation.

700
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,187
Fucking asshole
sitting next to me

701
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:00,724
figures he's gonna state
his opinion,

702
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,826
but he don't realize

703
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:08,331
who the fuck he happens to be
sitting next to.

704
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:13,904
Another benefit
of losing over 100 pounds

705
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,438
and getting your hair cut

706
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,643
to look like Rod Stewart's
half-a-lesbo sister.

707
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:28,251
So the guy has the nerve to say,

708
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:32,889
"Uh, why don't you just
leave the freakin' dog at home?"

709
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,559
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
come on.

710
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,360
I don't act.

711
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,597
I react.

712
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,632
And I'm
Lisa freakin' Lampanelli.

713
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,734
Are you kidding me with this?

714
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,504
So, like,
I can't help what I say.

715
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,242
So I honestly said this.
It was so horrible.

716
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:57,714
He goes, "Uh, why don't you
leave the freakin' dog at home?"

717
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,316
And I go,
"Really, sir, great idea.

718
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,451
"In the meantime, why don't you
go fuck your mother?

719
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:04,120
"How's that sound?

720
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:05,989
"Yeah, 'cause I'm sure
at one time or another,

721
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:07,357
"I've had to listen
to your ugly kids

722
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,125
"screaming away
when you should have had them

723
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,760
"stowed
in the overhead compartment

724
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,530
wheels first, bitch."

725
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:16,700
Oh, oh, you guys didn't know?
That's the new rule.

726
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:19,703
If you have children under ten,

727
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:24,507
they must be stowed
in the overhead compartments.

728
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,976
Would that not be the greatest?

729
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:29,479
Oh, my God, I fucking hate
those screaming kids.

730
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,314
Oh, but by the way,

731
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,116
there's always a woman
after the show

732
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:36,853
who, like, really hates
that joke, and, um,

733
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:40,624
she finds it very difficult
to hear humor like that.

734
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:43,426
And she's always a mom,

735
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,530
always a white mom.

736
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:51,935
The healthy snack mom.

737
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:55,038
The mom who buys her kid
food gluten-free

738
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,175
as if gluten's
actually "a thing."

739
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:02,779
And she's that mom who,
now that she opened up

740
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,815
her horrible, splotchy,
bumpy thighs

741
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,884
and that little freakin'
bloody head

742
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:11,021
skyrocketed across the room,

743
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:15,959
that she was suddenly reborn--
Mother Earth knows all--

744
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,995
When a mere three years ago,
she had five black cocks

745
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,731
stuffed up
in that freakin' thing.

746
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,803
Well, you know something?

747
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,205
Due to your response
to those women,

748
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,840
I can tell
you all have a bone to pick

749
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,742
with that type of mother,
so you know what,

750
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:35,845
I think it's my responsibility

751
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,983
as an elected official

752
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,919
to give
a public service announcement

753
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,156
to those mothers out there
who are like that.

754
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,391
Yes, 'cause I don't know how,

755
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:51,895
but always at least a couple
find their way into my show.

756
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,463
I don't know how
they even heard of me.

757
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:55,131
It's like their husband said,
"No, no, honey, come on.

758
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,233
"No, she's fine. No, seriously.
No, come on, man.

759
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:58,935
"She's like Kathy Griffin.
It'll be great.

760
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:02,839
Don't worry about it."

761
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,241
Okay, so this is
a public service announcement

762
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,143
for those mothers,
and by the way,

763
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,479
if you guys look around
and you don't see

764
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,548
one of those moms, guess what.

765
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,885
You are that freakin' mom.

766
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:19,956
Okay, mothers, PSA number one.

767
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,793
There is no such goddamn thing

768
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:26,162
as a "peanut allergy."

769
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:29,332
That is
a bullshit made-up allergy

770
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,634
that your little, rotten,
spoiled white kid

771
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:32,969
made up in his own head,

772
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,537
so he could get
a delicious bologna sandwich

773
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,239
instead of the peanut butter
and jelly

774
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,908
on two stale heels
of Wonder Bread

775
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,444
that he so richly earned.

776
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,813
Yeah.

777
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,883
If you think your kid is
allergic to peanuts, guess what.

778
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,952
Go home tonight,
spread a jar of Jif

779
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:51,521
all over his ugly,
splotchy body.

780
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:54,057
He'll either break out in hives
and be cured instantly,

781
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,695
or he'll be dead, and either way
is fine with Lisa Lampanelli.

782
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,168
PSA number two.

783
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,105
Mothers, stop shopping

784
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:12,542
at Whole Foods.

785
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,913
Fuck Whole Foods
in the ass, mouth, and cunt.

786
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,848
Fuck 'em.

787
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,184
Who on God's green earth

788
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:26,689
needs two grapefruits
for $79.99?

789
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:33,396
They're like,
"Oh, they're organic and fresh."

790
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:34,197
Really?

791
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,265
So's my twat,

792
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:40,136
but I don't charge $79.99!

793
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,342
And by the way, did you ever
notice the only bitches

794
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,112
who shop at Whole Foods
are 400-pound women?

795
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,347
Bitch, it's called Whole Foods,

796
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,484
not "eat the whole
fucking store."

797
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:03,059
And PSA number three.

798
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:08,765
Stop with the god... damned

799
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:12,702
hand... sanitizer.

800
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,574
Quit it with the Purell.

801
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,742
You're turning your little boys

802
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:25,381
into little germophobic people
with compromised immune systems

803
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:28,518
like these two fucking fags.

804
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:35,024
This has been
a public service announcement...

805
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,061
By Lisa Lampanelli.

806
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:41,397
I approve this message.

807
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,668
That was insane.

808
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,306
I was, like,
yelling really loud.

809
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,041
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

810
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,577
There's always that bitch who
comes up to me after the show.

811
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:58,581
She's like, "Lisa, that joke
about the overhead compartment

812
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:03,953
"is very dangerous
and irresponsible.

813
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:09,926
"If I put my child
into the overhead compartment,

814
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:12,996
he could suffocate and die."

815
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:16,232
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
maybe if he does,

816
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:19,836
isn't that what's meant to be?"

817
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,006
See, I believe
in all that stuff.

818
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:24,774
"If it's meant to be,
it's meant to be."

819
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:27,043
I like all the sayings,
you know,

820
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,378
'cause I work on myself.

821
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,880
I've been doing
very intense work on my--

822
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,650
In fact, couple weeks ago,

823
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:37,353
I went
on this seven-day yoga retreat,

824
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:41,758
and get this, I don't do yoga.

825
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,129
I don't even know
what the fuck yoga is.

826
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:49,265
I thought it was
a frozen yogurt retreat.

827
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,870
Now, I can tell you honestly,

828
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:58,575
after seven days of boring hell
watching these fat bitches

829
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,843
who just wanted a place
to go for a week

830
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:06,149
that they didn't have to put
a zipper on their fucking pants,

831
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:08,551
after watching
these yeast infections

832
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:11,387
waiting to happen for a week,

833
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,489
I can honestly say and observe

834
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:16,526
that I am sure that yoga
was invented by some fag

835
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:19,562
who wanted to learn how to suck
his own cock for himself.

836
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:27,136
Pretty confident of that.

837
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,873
So I'm at this yoga retreat.
I'm bored to death.

838
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,842
There's no TV. There's nothing.

839
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:35,411
I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go
to the gift shop."

840
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,013
Well, get this.

841
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:39,649
All these rich whores
who go to those things,

842
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:41,184
they're easy marks.

843
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:43,319
They'll buy anything
with a nice saying on it.

844
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:46,022
They're so fucking stupid.

845
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:47,991
There was a little basket.
You're gonna die.

846
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:51,327
Spic, you'll die. Freakin'--

847
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,162
They have these rocks.

848
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:57,567
These whores are buying rocks
with a saying on it.

849
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:58,835
Are you kidding me?

850
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,236
Collect your own,
you stupid bitch.

851
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:03,539
You got a Sharpie?

852
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,977
They're banging 'em each
for 20 bucks for a rock,

853
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,379
and it says nice stuff on 'em.

854
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:13,216
It says, "Believe.

855
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:16,486
"Dream.

856
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:20,723
'Nam-ast.'"

857
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,158
I don't know what that is.

858
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,629
I don't speak Spanish,
but I will find out.

859
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:28,531
So I was so angry at these women

860
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:29,832
spending their money
on that crap,

861
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,035
I said, "I'm gonna--
When I go back,

862
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:35,672
I'm mixing up
a few rocks of my own."

863
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,907
I can do shit
that I would say to people.

864
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,642
Screw that,
I need a couple of rocks

865
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:41,010
and a freakin' Sharpie.

866
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,979
I'm golden.

867
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:44,847
My rocks will say stuff
that'll set

868
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,417
these bitches' heads spinning.

869
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:49,252
My rocks will say,

870
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:52,422
"You're worthless.

871
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:55,692
"You'll never find love.

872
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:58,828
Black guy,
that's not your real father."

873
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,966
the best new thing
for me to go into?

874
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:05,935
I could become
this crazy spiritual guru

875
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:08,171
who just got everybody going
on my wavelength.

876
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:11,708
I had my first
inspirational greeting card.

877
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:16,245
I'm going to perform it
for you right now.

878
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:21,617
"Dahnce"
as if no one's watching.

879
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:25,855
Love as if you'll never
be hurt again,

880
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:28,191
and queef

881
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:31,861
as if nobody's listening.

882
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,799
Old guy, do you know
what a queef is?

883
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,803
It's a cunt fart, is what it is.

884
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,907
The faggots
are laughing really hard.

885
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,211
His butt plug
almost shot right out.

886
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,645
What's a butt plug for?

887
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,547
Like, I don't even know.
Do you know?

888
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:55,218
Which one of you is the guy,
and which is the girl?

889
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,454
You don't have that logic?
No, you just versa?

890
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:01,591
Anytime, anywhere?

891
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,700
Well, good for you.

892
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,401
Boy, I tell you,
I did have to start

893
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,836
working on myself
after a divorce.

894
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:15,638
You have to figure
your stuff out.

895
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,707
Guess what my shrink says to me,
this bitch.

896
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:21,444
She told me
I have effed up ideas

897
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,613
about what
a relationship's like.

898
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:27,817
She told me I had to go
and take an inventory

899
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:32,688
of the crappy ways I was a wife
during the marriage

900
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,058
and how I also
contributed to its demise,

901
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,226
and I trust you people.

902
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,695
Can I read this to you tonight?
Is that okay?

903
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:42,732
Okay, 'cause it's
very vulnerable.

904
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:44,400
Okay, here it is.

905
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,602
It's six faults that you
probably don't know about me.

906
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:49,372
Okay, okay.

907
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:53,309
"I, Lisa Lampanelli,

908
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,878
am overly sensitive."

909
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,549
No, it's true.
I cannot take a joke.

910
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,951
I get my feelings hurt so easy.

911
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:05,855
How freakin' hypocritical
is that, though? Right?

912
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:08,491
I'm an insult comic
who can't take a joke.

913
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,859
That's like being a pedophile

914
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:14,530
who can't stand
children's parties.

915
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:17,800
That's like being an NFL player
who just can't bring himself

916
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:20,736
to punch his wife in the face
in an elevator.

917
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,177
Number two.

918
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,514
"I, Lisa Lampanelli,

919
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,049
have huge anger issues."

920
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:33,850
I do.

921
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,618
Honestly, my temper is hotter

922
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,420
than the black guy's
television set.

923
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:39,255
It's true.

924
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:42,391
If I was any angrier,
I'd be dating Rihanna.

925
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:43,759
I would.

926
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,328
Oh.

927
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,532
Shut up. She asked for it.

928
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,334
Big mouth.

929
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:54,070
Oh, and here's three.
Okay, fault number three.

930
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:57,773
I'm not technically bipolar--

931
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:01,811
But my moods swing a lot.

932
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,013
Like, when I'm not yelling,
I'm crying.

933
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:08,117
Honestly, my eyes leak more than
Cloris Leachman's "vaginer."

934
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,288
But here's the thing,
I won't cry

935
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,757
in front of a guy,
boyfriend, husband, nothing,

936
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,492
'cause it makes me
look too weak.

937
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:17,994
I'm afraid to be vulnerable.

938
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:21,297
I have put up more walls
than Pink Floyd.

939
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:25,268
I'm more emotionally distant
than Terri Schiavo.

940
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,204
Wait for it.

941
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:31,274
Oh, too soon?
It's ten freakin' years.

942
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:34,810
Let it go. She has.

943
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:37,580
No, seriously, I could be
colder in a relationship

944
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,248
than a penguin's asshole.

945
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:43,986
Bruce Jenner's face
is more expressive than I am.

946
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,257
Okay, this is a tough one.

947
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,961
Always get to number five
and I kind of struggle with it,

948
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:53,162
but I'm gonna be real.

949
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:55,064
I told you I would.

950
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,901
When I was married,
I weighed 248.

951
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,469
It's okay. I'm not ashamed.

952
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,506
Now I'm fucking sexy and hot.

953
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:04,974
However, when you're that big,

954
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:07,376
sometimes you hate your looks,
and, oh, man,

955
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,477
it was terrible in a marriage.

956
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:09,979
I couldn't take a compliment.

957
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,747
Poor Jimmy, he'd be like,
"Oh, you look nice."

958
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:16,686
I'd be, "Shut the fuck up,
you fat piece of shit."

959
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:20,656
After a year of intense
four-time-a-week therapy,

960
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,692
I have come to realize

961
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:26,963
that may have not been
the right response.

962
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,765
No, it's true. I learned that.

963
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,500
Like, they have
this thing in therapy

964
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:34,070
called "positive self-talk."

965
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:35,738
That's when you look in a mirror

966
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,774
and you say nice things
to yourself, so even back then,

967
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:40,776
I shouldn't have been
so hard on myself.

968
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:42,111
I should have looked
in the mirror

969
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:44,313
with a little self-compassion
and said,

970
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,015
"You know what, Lisa?

971
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:50,252
"It's okay you have a huge gut.

972
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:54,190
At least it makes your dick
look smaller."

973
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,426
Oh, my God.

974
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:59,462
Would that not be
the coolest thing ever

975
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:04,200
if I had a secret hidden penis
that I could whip out and use

976
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:05,334
whenever I needed to?

977
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,003
'Cause you know
my thing would be big,

978
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,338
and you know my shit
would be black.

979
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,540
Am I right?

980
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:16,679
See, you people laugh, but
I'm gonna tell you something.

981
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,814
If you have never been
overweight,

982
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:21,484
you do not understand
how hard it is.

983
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:25,221
Do you know how difficult it is
when I would walk onto a plane,

984
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:29,825
celebrity that I am,
250 fucking pounds,

985
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,228
and looking at all you
skinny fucking assholes

986
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,165
dreading that I would sit
my fat ass next to you?

987
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:39,869
You don't even have the nice
temerity to lift up that armrest

988
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:41,771
so it doesn't hit my ass cheek

989
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:45,908
every time
I walk down the aisle.

990
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,377
One time I sat next to a guy,
a skinny bastard,

991
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,279
and he gives me that look
like, "Ugh."

992
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:52,481
I just snapped.
I go, "Oh, really?

993
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:55,484
"Uh, you got that
screaming infant on your lap,

994
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:59,055
"and you're worried about my
love handle ruining your flight?

995
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:01,424
"Tell you what,
stop whining like a cunt,

996
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,592
"tuck in your elbows,
and just be happy you'll have

997
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:08,097
something soft to bump into
when the plane crashes."

998
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,867
That being said, you know what,

999
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,770
if you're out there
and you're overweight,

1000
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:17,406
you always have a place
on a plane

1001
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,308
next to Lisa Lampanelli.

1002
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,476
I love it.

1003
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:23,946
Fat people,
come and sit next to me, man.

1004
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:26,315
I love sitting
next to fat people.

1005
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:27,750
They don't talk.

1006
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,152
They're too busy chewing.

1007
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,494
And also, guys, do yourself
a favor and your woman.

1008
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,730
Even if you sense
she's getting a little chunky,

1009
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:44,567
do not call your woman fat.

1010
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:48,771
That is the last word
that a woman can be called,

1011
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:53,776
or she will twist your penis
into a balloon animal elephant.

1012
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,345
And I'll prove it.

1013
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,347
Even if you all
are skinny women in here,

1014
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:01,484
you would all
rather be called the C word

1015
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,753
than that particular F word,
and you know it.

1016
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:05,721
And I'll prove it.

1017
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,857
Not one of y'all bitches

1018
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:09,325
has ever said to your husband,

1019
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:12,862
"Honey, do these pants
make me look

1020
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:15,831
like a cunt?"

1021
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:21,704
We don't care.

1022
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,608
Ah, my last fault.

1023
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:29,111
Kind of--kind of hard to admit,
but it's just forewarning.

1024
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:31,780
If anybody wants to ask me out,
this is what you get.

1025
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,649
Fault number six.

1026
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:38,420
LL, lousy in the sack. Terrible.

1027
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,856
Sexually repressed,
won't try anything new.

1028
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:44,627
Do you blame me?
I'm from Connecticut.

1029
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:46,996
Oh, you know the sign
going into Connecticut says,

1030
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,264
"Welcome to Connecticut.

1031
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:52,501
You won't find
your clitoris here."

1032
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,905
I didn't learn how to do no sex.
I didn't know what to do.

1033
00:52:55,907 --> 00:53:00,409
I had one position--
"Ugh, hurry up."

1034
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:03,579
No, really, at heart, I--
In a lot of my specials

1035
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:07,049
in the past talk about sex,
but it's all fucking stories.

1036
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:10,019
You know, in reality,
I think I'm kind of

1037
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:15,691
more of a Charlotte
than a Samantha.

1038
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:16,959
Gay guys, could you explain that

1039
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:19,628
to the straight guys
in this area?

1040
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,830
No, 'cause you guys
heard of adventurous chicks.

1041
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,265
I ain't one of 'em, uh-uh.

1042
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:25,501
You guys all heard
of three input girls.

1043
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:28,671
Ew. Three input, that ain't me.

1044
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:30,606
I'm a three output girl.

1045
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:34,910
I can burp, fart, and queef
at the same time.

1046
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:37,947
But hey, who knows?

1047
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,782
Who knows what'll happen
in my life?

1048
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:42,618
I feel pretty freakin' lucky,
you know what I mean?

1049
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,486
I got a great career going,

1050
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:47,323
I'm working on my health,
and hey, who knows?

1051
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:49,291
Someday, I might find true love.

1052
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:51,594
We'll see. We'll see.

1053
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:58,234
I am just always reassured
by the words

1054
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:03,572
of my life coach
and mentor Meat Loaf,

1055
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:08,611
who once said,
"Two out of three ain't bad."

1056
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:13,249
Love me some Meat Loaf!

1057
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:19,221
Now, I didn't always play
lovely places like this.

1058
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:21,690
In your career, you have to play
some dumps, right,

1059
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,425
so check this out.

1060
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:24,693
Ten years ago,

1061
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,496
I'm working at this crap hole
in Vegas.

1062
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:32,268
I won't even say the name of it,
but it rhymes with Shmarrah's.

1063
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,672
So I'm doing the show,

1064
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:38,974
and I always bring
my opening act with me

1065
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:40,476
because I find them
really funny.

1066
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:43,145
I bring people I like,
so I have this gay guy

1067
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:46,548
opening for me years ago
named Wendel.

1068
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,284
He is the funniest fag.

1069
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,386
Oh, my God,
and he was super gay.

1070
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:55,024
I mean, this guy is so gay,
Cher buys his albums.

1071
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:00,562
This guy is so gay,
whenever he farts, it lisps.

1072
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:03,098
Sssss.

1073
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,102
So he's up onstage, right?

1074
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:08,504
I'm watching from the back,

1075
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:12,374
and I'm cracking up,
but get this rude crap.

1076
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:15,144
I notice there's six people
in the front,

1077
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:17,179
"high roller" types,

1078
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:21,150
who keep heckling him
with homophobic slurs,

1079
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:23,185
and I see that,
and I freakin' snap.

1080
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:24,853
I call over the hostess.
I'm like,

1081
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:28,190
"Get your freakin' minimum-wage,
$10-an-hour twat over here,

1082
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:32,828
"you fucking suck-a-high-roller-
cock-for-money bitch.

1083
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,831
"Those people are calling Wendel
homophobic slurs.

1084
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,166
"Get 'em out of here.

1085
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,034
"I won't have that energy
in the room.

1086
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,437
"Pay their ticket prices
back out of my pay.

1087
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:43,539
Get 'em out right now. Buh-bye."

1088
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:47,176
Am I right, or am I wrong?
I think that was moral.

1089
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:52,748
Well, I got to come up
onstage after him,

1090
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:57,186
and, oh, one other
little character flaw I have.

1091
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,555
Whenever I do something nice,

1092
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:02,424
I can't keep my mouth shut
about it.

1093
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:04,426
I always have to brag, you know.

1094
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:08,731
Oh, maybe that's why God
didn't give me a soul mate yet,

1095
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,632
'cause he's like,
"Lisa, if you would just

1096
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:14,403
"shut the fuck up,
do nice things,

1097
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,405
maybe I'll give you
a fucking good boyfriend,"

1098
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:18,974
and I'm like, "What the fuck
are you talking about, God?"

1099
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:21,577
And he's like, "Yeah, bitch,
maybe do something

1100
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:24,346
and not tell the freakin' world,
like, for charity."

1101
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:25,848
I'm like, "How dare you, God?

1102
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,283
"You have that goddamn book
full of all that crap

1103
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:29,385
"you ever did for anybody.

1104
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,086
"I see it in every hotel room.

1105
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:34,490
That's bragging if I ever saw
anything like that, God."

1106
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:36,325
And he goes, "Fuck you, Lisa."

1107
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:37,960
I'm like, "Suck this, God."

1108
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:44,299
Maybe that's why
I don't have a boyfriend.

1109
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:46,735
Jew, are you allowed
to say "suck it" to God?

1110
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,604
Jews, Jews, Jews, Jews?

1111
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:53,509
So anyway, when I
get these people kicked out,

1112
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:56,011
I come back on the stage,
and I'm all self-righteous.

1113
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:58,881
I come up, and I'm like...

1114
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:03,719
"You may have noticed there's
six empty seats up front.

1115
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:07,656
"That's 'cause these homophobes
were calling Wendel fag

1116
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:11,727
"and faggot,
and nobody does that

1117
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:16,398
in a Lisa Lampanelli show
except Lisa Lampanelli."

1118
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,169
Oh, yeah.

1119
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,373
So the audience is cool.
They start laughing.

1120
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,708
They're having a good time.
Well, get this.

1121
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,578
Halfway through the show,
I spot the guy.

1122
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,948
There's always this guy
at every show that I do.

1123
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,984
The arms folded like,
"You ain't gonna be funny

1124
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:38,554
'cause you a bitch" guy.

1125
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,622
Now, sir, I know you had
your arms folded the whole show.

1126
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,524
No, no, no, no, no. No, shut up.

1127
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:45,060
No, he's great, he's laughed
at every single joke.

1128
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:46,762
The arms folded was
just to separate

1129
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:47,796
the tits from the gut.

1130
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,998
I get it.

1131
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,269
Tit sweat is a bitch.
I've been a victim of it myself.

1132
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,007
No, but the guy in the audience
had the arms folded

1133
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:01,343
mean and scowly,
so I look at him,

1134
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:02,344
and I'm like a dog with a bone.

1135
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:04,012
I won't let it go.

1136
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,648
I'm like, "Oh, really, sir?
You're not gonna laugh once?

1137
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,183
"Really? Really?

1138
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:11,653
"Really? Really? Really? Really?

1139
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:12,955
"Really? Really?

1140
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:16,258
Well, guess what, bitch,
you can get the fuck out too!"

1141
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,961
And all of a sudden,
his wife goes, "No, no, no,

1142
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:20,195
"no, no, no, no, no, no.

1143
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:23,499
He's deaf."

1144
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,837
And you know what, folks?

1145
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:34,343
That is the moment that
I learned a little something

1146
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:39,848
about this elusive concept
we call self-esteem.

1147
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,584
I should have realized,

1148
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:44,820
if he wasn't laughing...

1149
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:52,561
He must be deaf,
'cause I'm Lisa Lampanelli.

1150
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:55,831
Thank you, guys! I love you all!

1151
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:59,034
Thank you, New York!
You freakin' rock!

1152
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:10,072
