00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:28,799
[Forrest] I once believed that no man can
own land any more than a tree squirrel can.

4
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:34,892
I found myself restless
in a place

5
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:38,722
where anyone can do
as they please yet very few do.

6
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,294
I was young and life was already
passing me by...

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,557
[water trickles]

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,085
...so, I unanchored,
burning my few seconds under the sun,

9
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,088
drifting in search of reality
rather than luxury.

10
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:00,613
I couldn't see it at the time,

11
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:03,529
but my lust was merely a lull

12
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:06,141
before a brutal
inescapable storm.

[mellow music playing]

18
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:14,198
Why do you live out here?

19
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:22,293
I love the smell...

20
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,215
and the birds and the turtles
and the cannonballs.

21
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,354
I love the way the light
reflects off the water...

22
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,663
and, yeah, these stars.

23
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,149
And it's quiet.

24
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,641
I don't know.

25
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,385
I just think
everybody struggles...

26
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:13,997
and if I'm going to struggle...

27
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,698
it better be for a life
that's worth it.

28
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:25,574
This to me, this is my life
that's worth the struggle.

29
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,449
This is how I want
to barely get by.

30
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:38,630
I don't really have
any big plans.

31
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:43,809
I think that's the best part.

32
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,120
Are you happy here?

33
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,692
I am.

34
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,743
[mellow music playing]

35
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,503
[Everly] Okay,
I've got a question for you.

36
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:26,896
Okay!

37
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,594
[Everly] What do you use
the binoculars for?

38
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,117
[chuckling]

39
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:32,684
Nothing!

40
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:36,949
[Everly] Oh, my God,
busted lone man on his boat.

41
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,517
[Forrest]
What would you use them for?

42
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,258
- Perving on people.
- [Forrest] Exactly.

43
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,564
[laughing]
Exactly.

44
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,653
Well,
I'm really no better than you.

45
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,568
Do you want a beer?

46
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:49,832
Well, no,
because then it'll make me pee.

47
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,444
And then I'll...
And I don't know where you...

48
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,533
I don't know where that happens.

49
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:58,493
There's a toilet.
You have to flip the bed up.

50
00:06:58,536 --> 00:06:59,711
[Everly] Oh, my gosh.

51
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:01,713
You don't have a curtain
or anything?

52
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:05,282
- [Forrest] I mean, I go outside, obviously.
- What, for all of it?

53
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,676
[Everly] Yeah, I haven't quite...

54
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,548
[Everly] You poo in the lake?
[chuckles]

55
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:13,290
Well, if you have to, yeah.

56
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,945
[Everly] If you have to?
You have to, like, every day.

57
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:17,773
You do that every day.

58
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,689
Well, I'll use the bathrooms.

59
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,561
I mean, it's all right
to pee in the lake but...

60
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:25,520
- [Forrest] You can't poop in the lake?
- No!

61
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:27,130
[laughs]

62
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:28,871
[Everly] Oh, my God.

63
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:31,874
Have some manners.

64
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:36,748
[upbeat music playing]

65
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:44,843
[motorcycle engine revving]

66
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,202
Hey!

67
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,553
Can you, uh...
do that somewhere else, please?

68
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,424
[laughs]

69
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:19,835
[water splashes]

70
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,707
Wait a minute! Oh, oh.

71
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,187
- Oh, why?
- People are watching.

72
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,580
[laughs]

73
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:39,245
[mellow music playing]

74
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:12,365
[laughs]

75
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:43,962
[Forrest] Where'd you learn
to dance like that?

76
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,703
[chuckles]

77
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:47,966
Kind of all over, you know, I...

78
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:56,801
Well, I first started ballet
when I was seven, in New Zealand

79
00:09:56,845 --> 00:10:01,110
and then we moved to Australia
for a little bit

80
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:04,548
and then I learned more,
like, modern and stuff,

81
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:07,116
and then we came to Missouri.

82
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,118
- [Forrest] And here you are!
- Here I am!

83
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:11,337
[chuckles]

84
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,732
[Everly] Yeah, on the lake
dancing on a boat.

85
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,957
So, how do you plan
on taking care of me

86
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,264
when we get older,
Mister Lake Man?

87
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,092
I thought you were going
to take care of me.

88
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:28,703
[gasps]

89
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,574
[Everly] No, I got to dance.

90
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh, we'll figure it out.

91
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:39,409
The money will come.

92
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:41,063
I think it's probably
more important

93
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:45,154
we measure success
in life experiences.

94
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:47,983
Don't you?

95
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,944
Yeah.

96
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,207
I like that.

97
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:56,600
You want to turn her port?

98
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:06,305
Not bad!

99
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,265
- [Everly] I get it right?
- You did.

100
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:12,181
Oh, I knew I had a 50-50 chance.

101
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:15,532
Port and left
both have four letters.

102
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,099
Okay. Good to know.

103
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,014
- [Forrest] Does that make sense?
- Yeah, it does, it does.

104
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:20,667
What's the front
of the boat called?

105
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:23,148
That's the bow.

106
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:25,977
What's that rope
that you've been playing with?

107
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:30,112
- This rope? Halyard.
- [Everly] Mm-hm.

108
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,201
It raises and lowers
the mainsail.

109
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,989
And what are those little things
blowing in the wind?

110
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:41,210
- These little things?
- Mm-hm.

111
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:42,864
Telltales.

112
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:44,735
Man, does everything
have a name?

113
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,694
I think so.

114
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,831
Okay. What's this thing called?

115
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,139
Gunnel, gunwale, gunwale.

116
00:11:57,182 --> 00:12:00,446
- It's a weird one.
- Mm-hm.

117
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,275
What's this?
What's this little guy called?

118
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,239
- I don't know.
- [Everly] Uh-huh.

119
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:12,415
I knew there would be something.

120
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:18,900
Well, I'm going to hit the head.

121
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:21,772
- [Everly] The what?
- To run the bilge.

122
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,602
No?

123
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,996
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

124
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:35,351
[water trickling]

125
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:37,570
- Cue wind.
- [Everly] We're not going anywhere.

126
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:38,528
[chuckles]

127
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:39,616
We're in a dead spot.

128
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:45,100
Here, cut us port, other way.

129
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:46,362
[Everly] No.

130
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:47,929
So, that's... It's opposite.

131
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:49,931
- [Everly] Okay, well...
- Yeah, I know.

132
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:52,411
I, technically, was right.

133
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:55,197
See the little ripples
in places,

134
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,027
lines of ripples
across the surface, that's wind.

135
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,813
Take us starboard.

136
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:04,771
- [Everly] Starboard.
- Starboard.

137
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:11,648
And then watch, watch the little telltales.
They level out

138
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:17,132
and it's time to tack,
and the wind will pick us back up.

139
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:18,916
Yeah, we did it too slow.

140
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,179
Oh, there we go!

141
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:23,921
Good, let that go.
Come over here real quick,

142
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,749
pull really hard.

143
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:26,924
- There it is!
- Look at that!

144
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:29,274
- [Forrest] There it is.
- I did it.

145
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:31,624
- Not bad.
- Sailing.

146
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,931
- Sailing.
- We are sailing, mate.

147
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:36,586
[Forrest] There's actually a really good
place to go camping right down here.

148
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,240
[Everly] I've never been
camping before.

149
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,676
[Forrest] You've never been
camping before?

150
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,939
- [Everly] No!
- You're kidding.

151
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:44,246
[Everly] No, I mean,
I've always wanted to go.

152
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,857
The idea of dinner over the fire

153
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:51,296
and waking up to the
birds chirping is quite lovely.

154
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,255
But I've never been.

155
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,779
I don't know
how I feel about that.

156
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:58,086
What kinda dad
doesn't take his kid camping?

157
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,045
[birds chirping]

158
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:21,065
[Forrest] Where do you see us
in the future?

159
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,982
In the future?

160
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:27,593
Yeah, together?

161
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,249
I see us in the wild.

162
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:39,736
[Forrest] My Uncle Ellis, he has his
business up in the San Juan Islands.

163
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,479
It takes people fishing
and whale watching.

164
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:44,741
Does pretty good.

165
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:51,226
Maybe some point, we can move
the boat up there, do that too.

166
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,713
You know, we really wouldn't even have
to wait if we don't want to, right?

167
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:08,373
- Mm.
- Mm.

168
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,896
No, I guess not.

169
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,774
Hey, do you have
any measuring cups?

170
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:21,604
I don't.

171
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:22,866
Mm.

172
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:33,616
[giggles]

173
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:38,316
- [Everly] What?
- [Forrest] What are you doing?

174
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,754
- What else am I supposed to do?
- I don't know, you're hilarious.

175
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:47,586
[Everly] Don't drink out
of the bottle, you grump!

176
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,720
- You're kidding me, right?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

177
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,026
Have some manners!

178
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,071
You just poured that
in your hands.

179
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:57,161
Yeah, well, I mean, I'm...
it's different.

180
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:00,338
Well, here's
your measuring cup right there.

181
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,344
What?

182
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:08,868
[laughs]

183
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:10,261
You're not going to get any,

184
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:13,525
you're not going to get any pud.
No, pud for you.

185
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:17,268
[mellow music playing]

186
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:24,841
[Forrest] All right.

187
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,799
I usually use hotdogs
but we're all out

188
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:28,888
so we're using
rotten chicken right now.

189
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,368
[Everly] That's revolting.

190
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,327
- [Forrest] They love it.
- [Everly] Okay!

191
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,285
[Forrest] They love anything
if you're patient.

192
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:35,808
That's a trick.

193
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:38,246
You know what?
I think you have something.

194
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,725
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

195
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:42,859
Here, stand up! One, two, three!

196
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,426
No!

197
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,862
No, no, no, no! No slow down.

198
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,820
- [Forrest] Look at that!
- [Everly] It's huge!

199
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:51,215
- Oh, my God!
- It's making a noise.

200
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:54,131
Oh, my God. It's tentacles.

201
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:55,828
[laughs]

202
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:58,875
Oh, oh, crikey!

203
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:04,620
What... what is, what is it?

204
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:07,057
[Forrest] I don't know. You must
have snagged something on the way in.

205
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,190
What on earth!

206
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,626
Is fishy okay?

207
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,062
- It's okay.
- Okay.

208
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:14,282
- What do you got there?
- I don't know.

209
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,153
- It's a little bit wet.
- What's it say?

210
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:19,287
I don't know. I can't tell.

211
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,680
It's got a little fishy.

212
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:28,557
It's supposed to say,
"You're a keeper, move in with me."

213
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,343
Aw!

214
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:35,259
- Are you sure?
- Come here, yeah! Of course.

215
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:38,175
You're okay with living on a
boat with me and catfishy?

216
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,786
I mean,
I pretty much already do.

217
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,137
All right.

218
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,010
[smooches]

219
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:48,446
All right, now,
take that guy off the hook.

220
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,056
No way!

221
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,623
[laughs]

222
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:15,256
[Forrest] I'm going to go get some
things from the country market.

223
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,519
- Do you want anything?
- I'm good.

224
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:38,366
Surprise!

225
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:41,195
[Forrest] Wow!

226
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:46,939
These look great.

227
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:49,333
- Did you make them?
- Yeah.

228
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:54,338
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

229
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,213
What's wrong?

230
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:08,700
I just got into it with my mom
earlier before I left the house.

231
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,009
Was it bad?

232
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:18,406
Yeah.

233
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,192
She wasn't exactly thrilled

234
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:25,848
that I was moving out here
with you, so.

235
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:32,811
Well, I can't say I blame her.

236
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:39,557
I guess I didn't really turn out
how they wanted.

237
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:40,906
[Forrest] Neither did I.

238
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,564
Well, I can't wait to meet them.

239
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:48,697
[laughs]

240
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,134
Anyway, look, none of that,
none of that matters.

241
00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:53,223
- No, it does not.
- Doesn't matter

242
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:59,490
Look, you've got sail...
sailboat curtains and folded rags.

243
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,753
I bought you something.

244
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:03,842
Oh, yeah?

245
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,279
Do you want to
tuck those behind you?

246
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:06,845
Yes.

247
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,239
- You bought me a little kiwi.
- That's a little kiwi.

248
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:11,023
And it does have two stickers,
give me that.

249
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,677
Who needs that?

250
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,333
- Well, thanks.
- Let me make sure.

251
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:17,813
[crunches]

252
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:19,162
Oh, well, it's good.

253
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:22,557
- You eat the skin?
- Not normally.

254
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,342
[laughs]

255
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:28,258
I got that a little later.
It's still good.

256
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:30,086
I like your dedication.

257
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:35,352
Oh, my God!
Look, I look like a little fish.

258
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:36,701
Pretty little fish.

259
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:38,007
[laughs]

260
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,748
Mm-hm.

261
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,710
Oh, God.

262
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:49,410
[huffing]

263
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:58,114
You ever feel like so many
people have it all wrong?

264
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,161
How do you mean?

265
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:04,076
They spend all this time

266
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,343
and energy
investing in retirement...

267
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:14,043
they may never see

268
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:17,829
and they don't invest anything
in the right now.

269
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:19,222
[chuckles]

270
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:20,354
Does that make sense?

271
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:24,749
[chuckles]

272
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:28,362
I mean, maybe they don't want
to be huge financial burdens

273
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:30,407
on their families
as they get older.

274
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:34,237
[sighs]

275
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:39,764
Yeah, if you live that long.

276
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:44,508
Why wouldn't you plan
to live that long?

277
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:52,516
[calm music playing]

278
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:19,064
- Mogul Bandit.
- Who's Mogul Bandit? - Why, I am.

279
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:48,442
[mellow music playing]

280
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:53,681
- [wind howls]
- [rope rattles]

281
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:02,559
[Forrest] You okay?

282
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:06,258
Yeah, I'm okay.

283
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:08,739
I was just really feeling
those waves up front.

284
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:13,744
[Forrest] My first mate's
never gotten seasick before.

285
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:15,267
[Everly groans]

286
00:24:15,311 --> 00:24:17,400
Don't worry, we'll be back
to the cove soon.

287
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:20,359
[rattles]

288
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:28,803
[calm music playing]

289
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:40,510
Not hot.

290
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:44,383
- [Everly] How are you?
- Well, getting off here soon.

291
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:46,168
[Forrest] It's busy like
it's a weekend or something.

292
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:50,172
[cashier] Yeah, fortunately,
I won't be here tomorrow.

293
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:52,914
Oh, that's lucky.

294
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:55,656
Neither of you
have your ears pierced, do you?

295
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:56,657
[Everly] I do.

296
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,223
- Really?
- [Everly] Yeah.

297
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:00,791
[cashier] My uncle just got
his ears pierced.

298
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,533
- [Everly] Really?
- It's like two weeks ago, but they're still,

299
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:04,926
they're getting infected.

300
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:06,754
[coin rattles]

301
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,277
- [cashier] You want your receipt?
- [Forrest] I'm good.

302
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,973
- [cashier] All right.
- [Forrest] Thank you.

303
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:10,061
Bye!

304
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:17,068
[Forrest] You got up early.

305
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:22,291
Oh, yeah, I went to see
that place where you said

306
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:25,599
you could see the elks
but I didn't find any.

307
00:25:32,693 --> 00:25:37,785
Listen,
I've been thinking about it.

308
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,004
If we wanted to move the boat,
we wouldn't have to wait.

309
00:25:41,963 --> 00:25:44,139
- My uncle Ellis didn't...
- I'm pregnant!

310
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:06,117
- [Forrest] You're sure?
- I'm sure.

311
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:12,863
- How do you know?
- I took a test.

312
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:17,607
When?

313
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:18,956
[Everly] I can't believe
my mom was right,

314
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,305
she said this exact thing
would happen

315
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,655
if I came out here with you.

316
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:25,920
[Forrest] Your mom?

317
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:28,574
How could your mom have
possibly known this whole thing?

318
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:30,446
Did you tell her?

319
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,709
I'm not going to tell them.

320
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:34,276
[Forrest] You have to tell
your parents.

321
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,322
[Everly] I can't tell them.

322
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:38,323
[sighs]

323
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,203
[yells]

324
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,945
Just a spider, Jesus.

325
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:57,386
[Everly] You don't understand,
I can't tell my parents.

326
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:00,476
I don't have that sort
of relationship with them.

327
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:08,702
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

328
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:14,142
We can't afford a baby!

329
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:19,321
What were you thinking?

330
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:24,021
What?

331
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:25,631
I can't believe I fell
for this whole thing.

332
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:27,808
[Forrest] Fell for this?

333
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:29,897
Yeah, all this talk of adventure
and travel

334
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,377
and we'll get off the lake and
it was never going to happen.

335
00:27:32,421 --> 00:27:34,379
It could happen.

336
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:37,426
[Everly] How? How's it going
to happen? We've got no money.

337
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:39,907
We live in the middle of the
damn continent on a lake,

338
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,257
on a boat, and I'm pregnant.

339
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:48,219
Even hospital bills alone.
You don't even have a job.

340
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:49,873
You don't have a job either.

341
00:27:56,314 --> 00:27:57,751
Just get it aborted.

342
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:03,800
Are you kidding?

343
00:28:03,844 --> 00:28:05,628
Well, it's obviously the worst
thing that could happen to us.

344
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,935
[Everly] You make me sick.

345
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,067
[Forrest] People do that.

346
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:12,417
[Everly] I can't believe
you'd even say that to me.

347
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:17,771
I didn't think
you were like that.

348
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:19,294
Well, I thought we were
on the same team.

349
00:28:22,123 --> 00:28:24,952
That didn't take long
to fall apart, clearly,

350
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,564
you've done nothing wrong here,
and this is entirely my fault.

351
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,783
You're a jerk!

352
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:46,800
[Everly]
We are on the same team.

353
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:51,848
I'm sorry.

354
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:54,677
I'm sorry too.

355
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,593
I mean, it's not like it's the first
time it's crossed my mind, you know?

356
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:03,817
I guess I just freaked out
when you said it out loud.

357
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,123
- You sure?
- Yeah.

358
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:10,562
I can't really see
any other way.

359
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:16,133
[huffing]

360
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:18,657
It's not like I can go home
like this anyway.

361
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:26,840
We'll figure it out.

362
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:06,836
[motorcycle engine revving]

363
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:11,319
Hey.

364
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:15,801
Talk to me.

365
00:30:15,845 --> 00:30:18,152
[sobbing]

366
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:22,243
It's too much. I don't know if I can
go through with this whole thing.

367
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:24,898
I'm with you, you know that.

368
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,643
You're not doing this alone,
I'm with you.

369
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:35,560
Whatever you want to do,
we can make it work.

370
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:36,910
You don't have to.

371
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:49,139
Well, I don't want to know if it's
a boy or a girl until it's born.

372
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:55,145
I don't want to know.
I don't want to...

373
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:03,110
- You don't want to know?
- No.

374
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:07,288
[sighs]

375
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,205
You know what this means?

376
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:16,732
We're going to have
to baby-proof the boat.

377
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,212

378
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:21,041

[laughs]

380
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:23,391
Stupid.

381
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:25,132
[laughs]

382
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,524
[Forrest] So, now that
we're going to have a kid

383
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:29,136
for the rest of our lives...

384
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,137
[scoffs]

385
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:35,098
...we're probably going to have
to move off the boat.

386
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:40,799
Well, I don't necessarily think
that's true.

387
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:43,454
[Forrest] You don't think so?

388
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:49,373
I mean, maybe...
maybe when it gets to school age

389
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:51,897
but I think while it's still
little, it'll be okay.

390
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,336
Anyway, by the time
it gets older,

391
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,686
we'll have a sidecar
for the bike, so...

392
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:59,514
[chuckles]

393
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:01,690
This is crazy,
we're going to have a family.

394
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:03,866
[Everly] Yeah!

395
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:04,780
[chuckles]

396
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:08,262
[sighs]

397
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:09,698
[Everly] Good crazy?

398
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,224
Yeah!

399
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:21,971
[birds chirping]

[cawing]

401
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,378
Just get it over with.

402
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,211
[rattles]

403
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:52,958
Hey, it's me!

404
00:32:53,002 --> 00:32:54,960
I'm sorry I haven't called
in a while.

405
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:59,052
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm still out at the lake.

406
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:04,970
How have you... No!

407
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:08,800
Mom, no, I'm happy!

408
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,802
Isn't that what you want
to hear?

409
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:13,979
I don't...
Look, that's not why I call...

410
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,764
I didn't call
to fight with you, mom.

411
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:20,682
Mom, I wanted to tell...
I don't know!

412
00:33:20,725 --> 00:33:23,859
I don't know when.
Yeah, he's taking care of me just fine.

413
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:27,080
He's treating me
really well, actually.

414
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:30,213
I don't know what you want.
I... Yeah, you know what?

415
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:32,476
I'll talk to you later.

416
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,740
Mm-hm. Yeah. I'll send you
a Christmas card, okay? Bye!

417
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:36,698
[phone thuds]

418
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,880
I'm sorry.
I just can't talk to her.

419
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:48,449
[leaves rattling]

420
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:49,624
It doesn't matter.

421
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:56,326
Just start calling her grandma.
She'll get it.

422
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,675
It's not funny.

423
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,775
[indistinct chatter]

424
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:14,431
Mmm!

425
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:16,041
I knew you were going
to do that.

426
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:18,696
If it wasn't you, it was someone
that was going to...

427
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,613
Can you see the little...
my little belly?

428
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:23,701
I can see it.

429
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,270
I can see it just barely.

430
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:29,533
- You're not just pushing it out?
- No!

431
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:31,753
That's really there.

432
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:34,364
[groans]

433
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,279
How's it going?

434
00:34:36,323 --> 00:34:40,457
I'm almost done
and then I have that one...

435
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:42,285
- Yes.
- ...and then I have that one.

436
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:52,774
- Look at the dinosaur!
- That's cute!

437
00:34:52,817 --> 00:34:54,079
That is really cute.

438
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:00,738
[Everly] Hey, did you see the top
over there with the raccoon on it?

439
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:02,479
- I saw that.
- Isn't it cute?

440
00:35:02,523 --> 00:35:04,873
- It's adorable.
- Yeah.

441
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,180
I can't afford anything
in this store.

442
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,492
- I know.
- I'm sorry.

443
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,366
I understand. It's okay.

444
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,371
Why does it have
to be so expensive?

445
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,199
- It's tiny.
- Hmm

446
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:30,203
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

[truck engine revving]

00:35:42,215 --> 00:35:44,739
Keep it coming.

00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:45,827
Yup.

450
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,093
- Oh, man!
- Nailed it!

451
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:52,747
Is that gonna be okay?

452
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,575
- That'll work.
- All right.

453
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:57,230
- Hope you're thirsty!
- Well, yeah.

454
00:35:57,273 --> 00:36:00,494
Yeah. That would be great.
That's a ratty ass boat.

- You ever fish out of it?
- Occasionally.

You do any good fishing with it?

458
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:09,764
Oh, absolutely not.

459
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:12,070
Oh.

460
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:13,594
So, when are you going
to get a real job?

00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:18,163
- I'll let you know.
- Hey, I appreciate the beer.

463
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:19,295
[Forrest] Don't drink all those
on the way home.

No!

Yes, I'm learning a lot,
actually.

469
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:41,317
Someone calculated
that enough sperm

470
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:44,494
to provide the present
world population

471
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,496
could be put in a top hat.

472
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,501
That's how little they are.

473
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:57,333
That's really gross.

474
00:36:57,377 --> 00:36:58,465

00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:21,939
- That looks perfect.
- It's going to work.

480
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,205
[Everly]
So, I've been thinking...

481
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:29,207
The baby's already
getting pretty expensive

482
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,296
and we haven't even been
to the doctor yet.

483
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:36,214
[sighs]

484
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:38,695
I know.

485
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:40,697
I've been looking.

486
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:44,440
I have, but if I take a
full-time job in town right now,

487
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:46,442
I'm never going to be able to
finish painting the hulls

488
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:48,444
by spring like I said I would.

489
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:52,883
I think the money we get from
that, plus what we have now,

490
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:55,016
we're going to be fine.

491
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:57,018
It'll be enough to get us
through pregnancy.

492
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:00,761
[Everly]
Well, that's the other thing

493
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:05,113
is that I don't think we're
covered on my parents' insurance.

494
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:09,334
[calm music playing]

495
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:19,040
We don't have to worry
about that right now, not yet.

00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,128
[Everly] You don't think?

497
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:25,046
No, and even if we wanted to
invest in a real place to live,

498
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:26,700
we're never going to be able
to sell a boat

499
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:28,266
in the middle of winter time.

500
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,531
Yeah.

- [Everly] Yeah.

508
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,603
I still like the name Mahi.

510
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:31,825
You won't let that go.

its whole life.

its name twice.

00:41:39,223 --> 00:41:42,096
- What about Marlin?
- What's with you and fish names?

515
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:44,707
[Forrest] What's wrong
with fish names? Fish are cool.

516
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:47,580
I mean, there's not a fish
in my belly.

518
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:51,584
No fish names.

Well, let's just call it Bruce.

521
00:41:57,851 --> 00:41:59,287
What about Mako?

522
00:42:03,378 --> 00:42:06,773
- I like that.
- [Forrest] Mako, the boy

523
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,472
or Mako, the girl.
Just, Mako, the baby.

524
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:13,083
- Baby Mako.
- [Forrest] Baby Mako.

525
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:14,607
- That's sweet!
- [Forrest] You like it?

526
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,520
I like that.

527
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,220
I like it.

528
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,743
Oh, my gosh, it's kicking.

529
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:22,527
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

530
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:24,138
Do it again!

531
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:26,488
Kick me! Come on!

532
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:28,577
[Everly] I don't know
if it does it on demand.

Oh, do not go out there.

536
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:51,905
It's a bit chilly.

537
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,042
What do you think the baby's
going to be like?

538
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:02,611
[calm music playing]

539
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:05,353
I can't wait to take it
to my grandparents' place.

540
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:13,404
I can't wait
to take it swimming.

Forrest!

547
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:46,019
[Forrest] Hang on!

548
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:48,021
Forrest!

549
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:50,632

- I think the baby's coming.

[tense music playing]

551
00:44:52,547 --> 00:44:55,245

- The baby's coming.

552
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:57,639
[Forrest] Already?

553
00:44:57,682 --> 00:44:59,641
- You're sure?
- Yes!

554
00:44:59,684 --> 00:45:02,383
Put the stuff that I folded,
put it in your bag.

[tense music playing]

556

[motorcycle engine revving]

558
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:31,194
Sorry.

559
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:50,126
All right coming in right here.

Okay, okay.

563
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:12,975
Squeeze my hand.
Squeeze it hard.

564
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,585
Push, push.

565
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:19,852

567
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,379
You're doing good.

568
00:46:25,422 --> 00:46:27,381
[doctor] Deep breath.
Deep breath.

569
00:46:30,906 --> 00:46:32,038
Okay.

577
00:47:23,872 --> 00:47:25,961
No!

578
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:29,399
- Why is... why isn't it crying?
- I don't know, baby.

579
00:47:29,443 --> 00:47:34,709
[tense music playing]

580
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:37,364
- It's okay.
- What?

581
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,441
He's all cleaned up, if you guys
would like a moment with him.

582
00:48:53,135 --> 00:48:54,267
Wake up.

583
00:48:58,619 --> 00:48:59,663
Wake up.

584
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,740
His name is Mako.

585
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:38,267
Thank you.

586
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:41,879
- [nurse]How do you spell that?
- M-A-K-O.

587
00:49:50,105 --> 00:49:51,715
[nurse] Would you like a picture
with Mako?

588
00:49:54,979 --> 00:49:57,025
- No, thank you.
- [Everly] Yes.

589
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,377
I don't want to bury my son

590
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:03,945
without being able to remember
what he looks like.

[door opens]

595
00:51:08,227 --> 00:51:10,707
[nurse] I'm going to have to ask
you a couple questions if it's okay.

596
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:17,279
We never actually got
your address, what is it again?

597
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,025
We live on our boat right now
on Lake Lotawana.

598
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:26,549
[nurse] So...

599
00:51:26,593 --> 00:51:29,335
I can give you
my parents' address if you like.

600
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,641
[nurse] Okay, that will work.

601
00:51:31,685 --> 00:51:33,295
And as a service,

602
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:35,645
we provide
for our families here,

603
00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:37,560
we can offer cremation for free.

604
00:51:39,258 --> 00:51:41,173
Does that sound like something
you would like to do?

605
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:51,618
Can you give us some time
to think about it?

606
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:56,797
[nurse] Unfortunately,
due to the situation,

607
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,625
we need to go ahead
and make our decision.

608
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,775
[water bubbling]

609
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,169
I love you.

610
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:12,133
I love you too.

616
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:26,327
[Forrest] Hey, Everly.
Hey, Everly.

00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:30,853
[sobbing]

618
00:56:34,596 --> 00:56:36,076

[sobbing]

620
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:48,480
I can still feel him kicking.

621
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:01,014
And hear him crying.

622
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,193
[Forrest] I'm so sorry.

623
00:57:11,415 --> 00:57:13,200
I don't want to be here anymore.

626
00:57:32,654 --> 00:57:37,572
This is stupid, the way we've
been acting towards each other.

627
00:57:37,616 --> 00:57:40,096
We're supposed
to be on the same team.

628
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,185
Remember that?

629
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:43,709
[Everly]
What are we going to do?

630
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,667
We can't even pay
the hospital bills.

631
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:47,539
It's not really any way
I'm getting around that.

632
00:57:47,582 --> 00:57:50,019
You can't really measure that
in life experience

633
00:57:50,063 --> 00:57:51,891
and pay them that way.

634
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:54,284
- [Forrest] We will figure it out.
- We'll figure it out?

635
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:55,677
- Yeah.
- Really?

636
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:57,244
That's what you say every time,

637
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:58,985
that's your answer
for everything.

638
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:03,119
- You're just lazy.
- Yeah, and you...

639
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:05,557
This is your excuse
for being lazy.

640
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:10,474
[Forrest] You know, you've been
really enjoyable lately,

641
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:11,954
especially tonight.

642
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:16,002
[Everly] I don't even know
what we're doing anymore.

643
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,578

I don't really know either.

Hey, loner, over there on the
boat, I got a surprise for you.

664

You're going to need to put
some pants on though.

I just got it
when I was out the other day.

01:15:42,874 --> 01:15:45,006
Sweetie, don't forget
to go to the bathroom!

707
01:16:08,247 --> 01:16:09,422
[switch taps]

708
01:16:19,127 --> 01:16:22,783
[mellow music playing]

709
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,443
Shh!

710
01:16:38,146 --> 01:16:40,627
Michael, do you need any help?

711
01:17:09,482 --> 01:17:13,268
[door closes]

712
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:08,933
Hey!

713
01:18:13,328 --> 01:18:14,765
Hey!

714
01:18:14,808 --> 01:18:18,769
- [Everly] They're gone.
- Are you crazy?

715
01:18:18,812 --> 01:18:23,599
This is so stupid, come on!
We got to get out of here.

716
01:18:26,385 --> 01:18:27,908
Oh, my God.

717
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:41,661
Are you done?

718
01:18:44,098 --> 01:18:45,012
[door opens]

719
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:49,582
[door closes]

720
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,806
Who the hell are you?

721
01:19:07,078 --> 01:19:10,385
Hey! Hey!

722
01:19:17,262 --> 01:19:18,132
Run!

723
01:19:18,176 --> 01:19:19,307
Right, right, right.

724
01:19:28,403 --> 01:19:29,883
Oh, my God.

725
01:19:29,927 --> 01:19:32,320
[panting]

726
01:19:32,364 --> 01:19:33,669
That was crazy, huh?

727
01:19:44,724 --> 01:19:46,900
We took their stuff.

728
01:19:46,944 --> 01:19:48,597
[sighs]

729
01:19:48,641 --> 01:19:50,686
[laughs]

730
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,166
That was incredible.

731
01:19:58,869 --> 01:19:59,957
Let's get out of here.

732
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:09,967
[birds chirping]

733
01:20:14,797 --> 01:20:17,191
- Look at this!
- [Forrest] This looks amazing.

734
01:20:17,235 --> 01:20:19,541
[laughs]

735
01:20:19,585 --> 01:20:22,849
I do feel a little bad though.

736
01:20:22,893 --> 01:20:25,330
- Now they got to go get more.
- Oh, don't.

737
01:20:27,767 --> 01:20:29,638
Next time,
we'll get some milk too.

738
01:20:31,945 --> 01:20:35,340
[spoon clanks]

739
01:20:35,383 --> 01:20:37,864
Next time?

740
01:20:37,908 --> 01:20:40,084
[Everly] Yeah,
I was thinking tonight

741
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:42,869
we could go to that cove
over near the canoe club.

742
01:20:49,702 --> 01:20:52,400
We almost got caught last time.

743
01:20:52,444 --> 01:20:54,968
This time, we were stupid.

744
01:20:55,012 --> 01:20:58,145
[Forrest] We weren't stupid.
We had no idea they'd come home.

745
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,627
It's just bad luck.

746
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:03,977
I haven't even ever been close
to getting caught before.

747
01:21:06,588 --> 01:21:08,286
I thought you might be over it
after that.

748
01:21:10,723 --> 01:21:13,595
No way. That was the best one.

749
01:21:20,385 --> 01:21:22,039
I can't change your mind, can I?

750
01:21:25,825 --> 01:21:30,786
[upbeat music playing]

751
01:22:26,668 --> 01:22:29,671
This whole thing
is a refrigerator.

752
01:22:29,715 --> 01:22:31,630
There's ice.

753
01:22:31,673 --> 01:22:34,676
Your favorite.

754
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,026
[laughs]

755
01:22:36,069 --> 01:22:38,071
We should have brought
a bigger bag.

756
01:22:38,115 --> 01:22:39,594
Should have bought
a bigger house.

757
01:22:47,515 --> 01:22:50,083
But I still love this
wee octopus.

758
01:22:50,127 --> 01:22:51,606
Hello.

759
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:53,608
It can live in our zoo
with our new pelican.

760
01:22:53,652 --> 01:22:56,002
Oh, they match. So mean.

761
01:22:56,046 --> 01:22:57,612
[Forrest] We're going to have
to separate them

762
01:22:57,656 --> 01:22:59,223
because I don't think
they get along in real life.

763
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,921
Where are we going to put
all this shit?

764
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:03,749
I can't believe I took this.

765
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,011
[giggles]

766
01:23:05,055 --> 01:23:06,752
Damn, this is a hard one.

767
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:10,060
He should actually go on
the other side of the piranha.

768
01:23:10,103 --> 01:23:12,627
- Oh, you're right.
- [Everly] If we made a base for him.

769
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:14,281
[Forrest] Oh, my God,
you're right.

770
01:23:14,325 --> 01:23:16,588
[Everly] Yeah. Oh, look at them!

771
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:17,980
They're friends.

772
01:23:18,024 --> 01:23:20,026
[Forrest] We don't need
any of this shit.

773
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:21,419
[laughs]

774
01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:24,857
- But look how nice it looks.
- It's true.

775
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:28,861
[upbeat music playing]

776
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,302
[ball thuds]

777
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,175
We got to get back here.

778
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:12,791
What are you going to do
with that?

779
01:25:12,834 --> 01:25:14,967
Mm, I was thinking
we could sell it.

780
01:25:19,798 --> 01:25:21,582
I don't like this.

781
01:25:21,626 --> 01:25:22,670
We should go.

782
01:25:24,759 --> 01:25:25,891
This isn't us.

783
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:34,856
Really, we should leave.

784
01:25:36,902 --> 01:25:38,251
This doesn't feel right.

785
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:42,342
Hey!

786
01:25:48,174 --> 01:25:49,044
Hey!

787
01:25:51,786 --> 01:25:53,005
Are you listening to me?

788
01:25:54,789 --> 01:25:58,184
Hey! Can you wake up?

789
01:25:58,228 --> 01:25:59,446
Wake up?

790
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,926
I don't even know you right now.

791
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:03,320
Well, you think
you've got it all figured out?

792
01:26:03,363 --> 01:26:06,018
You think you understand
everything? You don't!

793
01:26:06,061 --> 01:26:08,107
I don't understand.

794
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:12,938
I'm standing right here
and I understand.

795
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:15,506
You're losing it
and you know it too.

796
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:26,908
We messed up. I'm not going to
let that happen again.

797
01:26:34,046 --> 01:26:35,743
[Forrest] This is what
I don't understand.

798
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:39,138
[gunshot]

799
01:26:41,706 --> 01:26:46,188
