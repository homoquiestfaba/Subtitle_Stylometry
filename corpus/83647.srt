do this shit by yourself.

162
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,993
Look, man.

163
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,054
I got uptown on lock.
My man Drama runs Southeast.

164
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,224
Together, we could lock
this whole city down.

165
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,735
Look, all we need is the starter keys,
baby, and that's it.

166
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,568
That's all from there.
That's it.

167
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,479
A'ight. Tell you what
I'm gonna do then.

168
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,038
You know you my man. Your shit
always been tight all the time.

169
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,017
We'll go up top.
Go check my piece.

170
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,554
If everything a'ight
up there when I get back...

171
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,386
I come back here in about a week or two.
We'll come check you.

172
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,551
- We could rock. That's cool?
- All right.

173
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,993
- That's cool.
- All right, man.

174
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,064
[D-Mo, Narrating]
Now all I had to do...

175
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,998
was convince Drama
into hustling...

176
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,899
and bring all that bullshit
I just told Kenny to life.

177
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,140
Drama ain't really no hustler,
but all I really needed...

178
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:49,613
was another face, to make Kenny
feel a li'l bit more confident.

179
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,879
Huh. I told Kenny Drama had
Southeast on the lock.

180
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,284
Man, that was some bullshit.

181
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,618
Drama straight outta Northeast.
Lincoln Heights.

182
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,784
He don't even know
how to hustle.

183
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,125
The little money he do get
come from stickin'up crap games.

184
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,357
Or breakin'in nigga's cars
at the Go-Go.

185
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,833
Stealin'they guns.
Sellin' 'em to other dudes.

186
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,461
But if I could get him
to follow my lead...

187
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,200
[Chuckles] the young 'un would
be down with the program.

188
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,669
What's up?

189
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,738
Look, right? I don't even like bein'
here. I wanna make this quick.

190
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,819
Look, I know you and your moms kinda
been hurtin' for money, right?

191
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,753
- Yeah.
- But I was hollerin' at my man
from Houston last night.

192
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,222
He talkin' about puttin' us on,
helpin' us make some real money.

193
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:38,558
- Some real money, man.
- I ain't about sellin' no drugs.

194
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,825
Ain't no drug dealer,
I'm a thug, nigga.

195
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,094
It's better than this robbin'
and stealin' you doin'.

196
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:47,002
- It pay my bills.
- You ain't makin' no real money.

197
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,564
You can't honestly tell me you happy with
the way you livin'. Look at this, man.

198
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,769
Come on. Look.

199
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,142
Your moms still on ya, bro.

200
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,614
[Rick, "Drama"] This bama right.
I'm fucked up in the game.

201
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:02,517
'Cause I don't have no money.
And money rule all this shit.

202
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,580
If I don't have no cash,
I can't make no moves.

203
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:11,527
If I can't make no moves,
Mama gonna smoke her life away.

204
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,531
Still wearin' the same clothes
you had on last year.

205
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,158
You ain't never got no money.

Don't no women want nobody
that ain't never got no money.

207
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,539
- I ain't worried about that.
- Yeah. Well, look.

208
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,973
You need to worry about this:
You owe me money.

209
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,103
- How much money do you owe me, Drama?
- I don't remember owin'nothin'.

210
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,309
Yeah, you owe me. Look. I needs mine.
You need your own money. What's up?

211
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,718
- What you gonna do?
- [Sighs] Man...

212
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,087
I just got off two years' probation, dog.

- I don't know, man.
- Look, man. Look.

threaten me. I can handle my business.

marks... Its stretch marks looked good.

240

[Drama] Bein'as though I was
new to the dope game.

241
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,025
To me? Man, I had to add
my own little touch to it.

242
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:00,929
Everybody knew, but they
would have never figured out.

243
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,002
I was moving keys
in a matter of days.

244
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:08,630
In a big duffel bag,
with my hammer, on a bike.

but D-Mo...

246
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,135
was sendin'dudes to me
from his side of town...

247
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:19,809
and after a while, it's like itjust
started gettin'out of control.

248
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,978
[D-Mo] Now, you already know
Drama wasn't really no hustler.

249
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,080
On this job,
he caught on real quick.

250
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,058
And pretty soon, we had
the whole city on lock.

251
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,595
That's when things
really started movin'.

252
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,893
I went from meetin'with Kenny
once a week...

253
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
to twice a week.

254
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:41,803
And every time we met,
we got more and more work.

255
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,274
And the more we got,
the cheaper the number.

256
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,538
So I started makin'power moves.

Uh, he's been locked up for
about a year and a half now.

273
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,409
- Oh, yeah?
- Didn't even leave me a dime
to help take care of her.

I'm at college, gettin' my degree.

you were gonna do it.

- And you did.
Still lookin' good too, baby.
