1
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,179
All of our</i>
<i>earliest memories are lies,</i>

2
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,945
<i>family mythologies</i>
<i>handed down to us repeatedly</i>

3
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,578
<i>until they become as real</i>
<i>as what actually happened.</i>

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,317
Get the door, Mama.

5
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:05,263
<i>You may be king,</i>
<i>you may possess the world and it's gold</i>

6
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:10,196
<i>But gold won't bring you happiness</i>

7
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,706
<i>When you're growing old</i>

8
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:19,975
<i>The world still is the same,</i>
<i>you never change it</i>

9
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,547
Get the damn door, Mama.

10
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:26,949
<i>As sure as the stars shine above</i>

11
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:33,089
No one in the family can say</i>
<i>exactly when my mother went crazy.</i>

12
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,753
<i>According to Grandma,</i>
<i>she was always that way.</i>

13
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,592
Get the damn door, Mama.

14
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,633
<i>Dad said it started</i>
<i>when she lost the babies.</i>

15
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,466
<i>Seven miscarriages in eight years</i>
<i>can tend to do that to a person.</i>

16
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,301
<i>That's why my arrival on the scene</i>
<i>came as somewhat of a surprise.</i>

17
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,270
<i>I was born with the umbilical cord</i>
<i>wrapped around my neck.</i>

18
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,973
<i>I've been pissed off ever since.</i>

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,361
<i>The world still is the same,</i>
<i>you never change it</i>

20
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,271
The miscarriages had taken</i>
<i>such a toll on Mom</i>

21
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:27,245
<i>that she somehow got it in her head</i>
<i>that she'd lost me as well.</i>

22
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:35,654
<i>Well, you're nobody</i>
<i>'til somebody loves you</i>

23
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:42,761
<i>So find yourself somebody to love</i>

24
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,075
Shortly after I was born,</i>

25
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:06,482
<i>my mother drove me to California</i>
<i>and placed me in a Catholic orphanage.</i>

26
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,251
<i>I wish I could tell you</i>
<i>about my earliest memories there,</i>

27
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,655
<i>but the truth is, no one knows.</i>

28
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,528
<i>Back home, she claimed I had died at birth</i>
<i>and couldn't tell anyone where I was.</i>

29
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,696
What?

30
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,302
<i>Two years later, after another miscarriage,</i>

31
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,140
<i>she suddenly remembered</i>
<i>where she'd left me.</i>

32
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,114
<i>Despite all of Mom 's craziness,</i>
<i>Dad never stopped loving her.</i>

33
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,274
<i>But they divorced,</i>

34
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,150
<i>and I was passed around</i>
<i>like an unwanted Christmas fruitcake.</i>

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,563
<i>Eventually, my mother decided</i>
<i>she needed to be a full-time mom again,</i>

36
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,265
<i>and that we needed a fresh start.</i>

37
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,364
<i>I disagreed.</i>

38
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,501
- You'll have your own room.
- I already have my own room.

39
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,601
I'll get you bunk beds.

40
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,738
But why do I need bunk beds?
I'm an only child.

41
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,514
<i>It wasrt all bad.</i>
<i>The best thing in my life was my dad.</i>

42
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,185
<i>His name was Dell Fong,</i>
<i>and he was Chinese.</i>

43
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,725
<i>I identify him as being Chinese,</i>

44
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,317
<i>because his race</i>
<i>is the most vibrant memory I have of him.</i>

45
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,489
Richard, that's not safe.
Come on, time to work.

46
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,532
Maybe you can be a cook, too, someday.

47
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,921
<i>I could never be a cook like my father</i>

48
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,552
<i>because I'd already made</i>
<i>my career choice.</i>

49
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,220
<i>Superhero.</i>

50
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,698
<i>As a superhero, you occasionally</i>
<i>have to deal with something annoying,</i>

51
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,359
<i>like Kryptonite.</i>

52
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,665
<i>My Kryptonite was called home.</i>

53
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,308
<i>My mother had this ritual.</i>

54
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,743
<i>Every year, she'd celebrate the birthday</i>
<i>of each of the children she miscarried</i>

55
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,681
<i>by buying them a birthday card</i>
<i>and taking an overdose of sleeping pills.</i>

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,809
<i>That happened seven times a year.</i>

57
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,845
<i>I wouldn't call her successful at suicide,</i>
<i>but she was punctual.</i>

58
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,595
<i>My dad's Kryptonite?</i>

59
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,494
<i>Soy sauce.</i>

60
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:59,450
"Most people go to their graves
with their music inside them."

61
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,586
What was Mr. Holmes saying?

62
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,600
Come on, guys, it's not that hard.

63
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,694
He's saying that most people die

64
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:16,265
without discovering their own genius,

65
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:21,507
without expressing the uniqueness
that makes them special.

66
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,572
And that's what
this little exercise is about.

67
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:30,213
I want you to give me three minutes
about something, anything that you know,

68
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,757
that your classmates may not know.

69
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,997
Mr. Pimentel, I like your spirit.
Come on up.

70
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,768
Butt kisser.

71
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,334
Funny how things happen.</i>

72
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,673
<i>Only in hindsight do you realize how</i>
<i>something as small as raising your hand</i>

73
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,871
<i>can change your entire life.</i>

74
00:06:54,981 --> 00:07:01,011
Well, have any of you ever eaten chicken
at the Golden Dragon,

75
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,248
the Rickshaw Gardens
or the Chinese Gardens?

76
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,847
Well, you know the restaurants
don't buy live chickens, right?

77
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,654
They buy dead ones.

78
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,356
And you know where they get those
chickens and how those chickens die?

79
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,594
I do, 'cause I killed them.
I killed your dinner.

80
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,070
I've chopped the head off chickens
for every Chinese restaurant in the city.

81
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,470
You find the biggest knife you can find,

82
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,510
then you have to grab the chicken
by the lower of its neck and swing...

83
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,341
<i>I could've talked for hours.</i>

84
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,247
<i>Mr. Parks was almost as happy as I was,</i>
<i>because he ran the speech club.</i>

85
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,184
warnings of</i>
<i>approaching missiles over the Arctic.</i>

86
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,745
<i>And in other news, Soviet Premier</i>
<i>Khrushchev has made great strides</i>

87
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,124
<i>in his policy towards peaceful coexistence</i>
<i>with non-Communist countries.</i>

88
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,722
And I believe Premier Khrushchev
has made great strides

89
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,861
in his policy towards peaceful coexistence
with non-Communist countries.

90
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,768
<i>I may not have been</i>
<i>the most original speaker,</i>

91
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,397
<i>but I became a star.</i>

92
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,570
<i>Forget that superhero dream,</i>
<i>now I knew what I really wanted to be.</i>

93
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,936
Mom?

94
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,341
<i>I forget whose birthday it was this time.</i>
<i>I just know it wasrt mine.</i>

95
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:39,674
<i>My mother ended up surviving</i>
<i>only to leave me a few months later.</i>

96
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,983
<i>It didn't matter, though,</i>
<i>because I had plans.</i>

97
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,180
<i>Things didn't happen</i>
<i>as quickly as I expected.</i>

98
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,982
<i>A few years after high school, I got a job</i>
<i>working in the kitchen of a go-go bar</i>

99
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,546
<i>to earn money for college.</i>

100
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:23,186
Richard, I need that order 10 minutes ago.
I don't pay you to stand around.

101
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,027
<i>I still had my dream,</i>
<i>but there were a few distractions.</i>

102
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,676
<i>Bambi was a visual effect</i>
<i>that would only be rivaled years later</i>

103
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,179
<i>by my first viewing of</i>Star Wars.

104
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,557
Tiff, you're exposed.

105
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,423
What are you working on?

106
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,728
There's a tournament
at Portland State University,

107
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,496
and it's open to anybody.

108
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,367
So I figured if I went there
and I did really well, I might get noticed,

109
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,135
and who knows, maybe a scholarship.

110
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,470
No shit.

111
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,342
- What are you gonna wear?
- I don't know. Probably a sweater.

112
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,876
Oh, honey, no way.

113
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:24,017
You see that guy over there?
He owns the biggest mers store in town.

114
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,285
Girls.

115
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,373
<i>Did you hear about the midnight rambler?</i>

116
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,243
<i>Everybody got to go</i>

117
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,148
<i>Did you hear about the midnight rambler?</i>

118
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,207
Well done.

119
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,048
Yeah, thank you, sir.

120
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,547
Hey.

121
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,293
Mr. Pimentel?

122
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,990
I'm Ben Padrow with the University.
I'm chairman of the Speech Department.

123
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,033
Hi, Dr. Padrow, I know who you are.

124
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,694
Well, congratulations. I'm impressed.

125
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,359
Nice suit.

126
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,564
Oh, thank you very much.

127
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,663
Where do you go to school?

128
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,765
Actually, sir, I'm not in school right now.

129
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,642
I'm a little strapped financially.
But I'd love to come to State.

130
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,740
Well, we have scholarships
and financial aid. We'd love to help.

131
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,011
Come see me.

132
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,347
Yes, sir.

133
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,767
You're late.

134
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,539
I'm sorry. I was over at the admissions...

135
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,876
No time for apologies.
On the stage, let's go, come on.

136
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,042
I picked three speeches, like you asked.
Now, which one do you wanna see first?

137
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,518
The good one. Tick, tock. Come on.

138
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,952
All right.

139
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,861
Last meal's been eaten.

140
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,659
Last prayer has been said.

141
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,066
The prisoner is strapped
into the electric chair...

142
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,835
My black brothers will gladly sacrifice
for freedom overseas

143
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,206
when there's freedom in Birmingham...

144
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:30,738
...until my right to vote in this country
precedes my obligation to die for it.

145
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,019
Just sit down there, please. Right here.

146
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,166
You like it up there?

147
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,601
Yeah, I...

148
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,833
I like it better than anything.

149
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,999
Why?

150
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,008
I don't know.

151
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,601
Stop right there.

152
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,580
That's the first honest thing you've said,
"I don't know."

153
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:08,211
You don't know why you're up there.
You don't even know what you're saying.

154
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,686
Sure, you're talented and passionate.

155
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,485
You could fool some blue-haired judge
in high school, but not here.

156
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,492
This is another league.

157
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,454
Wait a minute, I...

158
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,523
I've won every single tournament
I've ever entered.

159
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
You didn't think that I was good?

160
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,836
I think you're the most gifted,
natural speaker I have ever seen,

161
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,876
and you have incredible potential.

162
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,503
And you are completely full of shit.

163
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:41,278
Hold on, wait a minute. So that's it?

164
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,117
I've been working towards this
for the last six years, all right?

165
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,125
I'm not asking... It doesn't have to be
a full scholarship. I can...

166
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,957
Look, my advice? You're not ready.

167
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,397
Go live a life. Fill yourself up.

168
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,696
Find out what's important,
earn a point of view.

169
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,793
- I...
- Earn.

170
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,136
Earn a point of view. Then come back
when you've got something to say.

171
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,135
"Get a life,"my ass.</i>

172
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:36,265
<i>I had a life, and there was no way</i>
<i>I was going back to it.</i>

173
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,469
<i>Fortunately, the government</i>
<i>had this program</i>

174
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,036
<i>where you could gain valuable</i>
<i>life experience and see the world.</i>

175
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:46,380
<i>They would guarantee your education</i>
<i>in exchange for services rendered.</i>

176
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,351
<i>It was called Vietnam.</i>

177
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,355
<i>Now my girl you're so young and pretty</i>

178
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,030
<i>And one thing I know is true</i>

179
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,535
<i>My reaction may have been a bit hasty.</i>

180
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:11,940
<i>After six months in country,</i>
<i>life in Portland didn't seem all that bad.</i>

181
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,276
<i>Watch my daddy in bed a-dyir</i>

182
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:19,044
<i>Watched his hair been turnirgrey</i>

183
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,986
<i>He's been workirand slavirhis life away</i>

184
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,320
<i>Oh, yes, I know it</i>

185
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,518
<i>Yeah</i>

186
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,655
<i>- He's been workir so hard</i>
<i>- Yeah</i>

187
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,223
<i>- I've been workir too, baby</i>
<i>- Yeah</i>

188
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,327
<i>Every night and day</i>

189
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,999
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

190
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,207
<i>We gotta get out of this place</i>

191
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,278
<i>If it's the last thing we ever do</i>

192
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,008
<i>We gotta get out of this place</i>

193
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:58,955
<i>'Cause girl, there's a better life</i>
<i>for me and you</i>

194
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,588
So we're gonna move off this hill
before they decide to take it from us.

195
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:12,103
I need four volunteers to stay behind.
This is your chance to be a hero.

196
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,966
I always wanted to be a hero.

197
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,905
All right, there we go. I need three more.

198
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,911
<i>Watch my daddy in bed a-dyir</i>

199
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,884
<i>- Yeah</i>
<i>- Every single day</i>

200
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,855
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

201
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,726
<i>We gotta get out of this place</i>

202
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,431
<i>If it's the last thing we ever do</i>

203
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,894
Sector One. Sector One. We need help!
Under fire in the sector. Over.

204
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,633
Let's move!

205
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,470
We're out. Let's go. We're out.

206
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:57,080
What you did out there took courage.
Know your outfit is proud of you.

207
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,550
I just wanted you to understand
that I'm personally proud of you.

208
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,109
I got something planned for you
you can enjoy,

209
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,314
while you're right here in Vietnam.

210
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,652
Carry on.

211
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,062
<i>Come here, sister</i>

212
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,299
<i>Papa 's in the swing</i>

213
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,132
Oh, the mother Iode.

214
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,938
Who needs a medal, huh?

215
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,033
I don't want a medal, man.

216
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,111
<i>He ain't no drag</i>

217
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,307
To surviving the surviving.

218
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,442
<i>Papa 's got a brand new bag</i>

219
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,053
<i>Come here, mama</i>

220
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,353
<i>And dig this crazy scene</i>

221
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,220
<i>He's not too fancy</i>

222
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,064
<i>But his line is pretty clean</i>

223
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,362
<i>He ain't no drag</i>

224
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,663
Bring it on, gooks.

225
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,205
<i>Papa 's got a brand new bag</i>

226
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,775
Incoming!

227
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,860
Richard! Point to where it hurts.
Can you hear me?

228
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,196
<i></i>

229
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,145
You got tinnitus. It's ringing in the ears.

230
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,814
I can't hear you.

231
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,494
<i></i>

232
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,053
You're lucky.
You only lost half your hearing.

233
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,066
Your friends lost theirs completely.

234
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,967
If I'm deaf,
why do I hear this noise all the time?

235
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,096
You lost your upper register,
and hearing aids won't help.

236
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,641
By the time you can hear
those high sounds,

237
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,542
the low sounds will be so loud,
you'd go crazy. You understand?

238
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,705
Can you just make the noise stop?

239
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,749
I can't. That's tinnitus.

240
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,378
Some days will be better than others,
but it won't stop.

241
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,379
Ever.

242
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:22,089

244
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,460
This is my letter of acceptance
to the university.

245
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,865
And I also brought
a couple of recommendations.

246
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,302
No, no, I can't authorize this.

247
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,438
I'm sorry. Could you speak up
and look at me when...

248
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,874
Thank you.

249
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,737
I can't authorize government funds
to send you to college.

250
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,941
Why?

251
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,415
You're deaf.

252
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,448
I'm what?

253
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,886
It's a deaf joke.

254
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,459
You're worse than deaf, you're confused.

255
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,224
You can hear only vowels, no consonants.

256
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,689
Yeah.

257
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,859
Well, if you can only hear vowels,
you've got two choices,

258
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,529
learn to read lips or move to Hawaii.

259
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,903
I don't wanna go to Hawaii,
I wanna go to college.

260
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,547
Listen, even if you graduate,
they won't be able to place you.

261
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,139
Why? 'Cause I'm deaf?

262
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,843
Helen Keller was deaf and blind.
She had a job.

263
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,011
- No.
- No, I know she had a job...

264
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,214
No, because of the ringing.

265
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,485
- Night and day, right?
- Yeah.

266
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,527
- In both ears?
- Uh-huh.

267
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,121
You won't be able to concentrate.
You'll forget what you've read.

268
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,893
You won't have any friends.

269
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,628
You'll be incompetent
and you'll be foul-mouthed.

270
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,135
No shit?

271
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,670
You know what?
Who the hell are you, huh?

272
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,237
You got a desk and a clipboard.
You don't know me.

273
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,875
'Cause if you did, you'd know
how close I am to coming over that desk

274
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,011
and shoving that clipboard
up your fat, pompous ass.

275
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,818
I'm gonna go to college, and I'm gonna
graduate, and then I'm gonna get a job,

276
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,792
and you can stick that
in your goddamn chart.

277
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,467
You ungrateful piece of shit!

278
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,938
Get your hands off me, bro!

279
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,406
- Don't touch me.
Get the hell out of here.

280
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,308
Don't fucking touch me.
- Don't come back.

281
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,152
Hey, bro, could you hold it a sec?

282
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,319
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

283
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,036
What the hell's wrong with you?

284
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,538
Thanks, man.

285
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,642
Damn thing only lights half the time.

286
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,348
Hell, I only work half the time myself.

287
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,588
You don't say much. Got a light?

288
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,125
Buddy, you got a light?

289
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,427
Hey, man, you deaf?

290
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,633
Yeah, I am.

291
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,931
I heard that. I lost a wheel.

292
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,634
Fucking peaceniks.

293
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,170
I'd hate them a lot more
if I didn't agree with them.

294
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,438
You wanna get a beer?

295
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,536
What?

296
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,776
A beer. A brew. Cold one.

297
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,681
It's 10:00 in the morning, man.

298
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
So?

299
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,745
No, no thanks.

300
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,461
Mike Stolz.

301
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,458
Mike.

302
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,464
Richard.

303
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,900
Like Nixon?

304
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,767
That's awesome. Here you go, bro.

305
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,832
That shit's good for you.

306
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,091
They overran us. Swarmed us, bro.

307
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,660
And it's just me and Jimmy left,
and I'm like...

308
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,164
I'm fucking gone. Fuck Jimmy, bro.

309
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,728
And I fucking stand to run,

310
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,864
and Jimmy pulls me down
and greases this guy that was right on me.

311
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,199
I never saw him.

312
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,640
Jimmy saved my life.

313
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,540
Then I look over, tell him, "Let's go, bro."

314
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,583
And Jimmy's head was just gone.

315
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,318
Motherfuckers!

316
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,901
He saved my life.

317
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,806
And God forgive me, bro,
I was gonna leave him there.

318
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:52,549
What the fuck, man?
Can nobody afford a decent roach clip?

319
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,986
Look at this shit.
What the fuck is this, bro?

320
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,035
Clearly, Kesey's expressing
his hatred for conformity.

321
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,765
Yeah, he's celebrating the individual,

322
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,534
but I think it's more about
the abuse of power.

323
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,939

324
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,874
The individual is disengaged
from the society, although...

325
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,435
I think it's more about the abuse of power.

326
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,483
As a result, he acts
as a spiritual and emotional...

327
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,677
...authority figure, right?

328
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,045
I...

May I?

342
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:23,999
I...

343
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,438
I don't...

344
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,811
Yeah, don't bother, all right? I'm deaf.

345
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:35,647
I can read lips, but not that well.
Those are gonna make me seasick.

346
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,215
You're welcome.

347
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,353
All right.

348
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,192
Damn boy scout.

349
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:57,305
You think you're too good to talk to me?

350
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,142
Wait a minute, I understood that.

351
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,545
You want a fucking medal?

352
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,379
No, I wanna hug you.

353
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,051
How about I shake your hand? Richard.

354
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,649
Art.

355
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,594
You better wash your hands.

356
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,658
This may be contagious.

357
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,333
You wanna sit down, Einstein?

358
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,137
Yeah, sure.

359
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,234
You wanna...

360
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,643
The only person on the planet</i>
<i>that I could hear</i>

361
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,013
<i>was a wickedly obscene genius</i>
<i>with cerebral palsy.</i>

362
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,848
<i>And the only person that could</i>
<i>understand him was a deaf vet.</i>

363
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,286
<i>We were like a traveling freak show.</i>

364
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,822
How old is that chair, anyway?

365
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,825
I saw tanks in Nam
smaller than that thing.

366
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,225
No.

367
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,493
Why the hell would I need a new one?

368
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,267
There's nowhere for me to go.

369
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,601
Hey, watch it!

370
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,003
Oh, sorry.

371
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,665
Can't you go forward in that thing?

372
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,869
Yeah, sure, if you blow me.

373
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,644
What? What's so funny?

374
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:10,738
What'd she say?

375
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,443
Oh, she just wants to blow me.

376
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,509
What did that spaz say?

377
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,490
Art is what I'm called.
A work of art, some would say.

378
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,460
Support Art and blow me.

379
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,091
He said he's very, very sorry,
and he'll try to be more careful.

380
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,294
- Yeah, right.
- Freaks.

381
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,030
Oh, and blow him.

382
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:01,521
This reminds me of my childhood.

383
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,294
You used to skate?

384
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:10,205
I used to sit here with the grandmas

385
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,903
and watch everyone else skate.

386
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,707
Times they are a-changing.

387
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,977
Yeah.

388
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,644
Are you a good skater?

389
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,120
Oh, hell no.

390
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,091
<i>It's your thing</i>
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

391
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,820
Oh, yeah.

392
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,823
<i>I can't tell you</i>

393
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,922
<i>Who to sock it to</i>

394
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,331
<i>It's your thing</i>

395
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,768
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

396
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,070
<i>I can't tell you</i>

397
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,938
<i>Who to sock it to</i>

398
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,409
<i>If you want me to love you</i>

399
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,242
<i>Maybe I will</i>

400
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,409
<i>I need you woman, it ain't no big deal</i>

401
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,714
Go faster, go faster.

402
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,723
<i>You need love now, just as bad as I do</i>

403
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,985
<i>Make's me no difference now</i>

404
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,427
<i>Who you give your thing to</i>

405
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,225
<i>Oh, it's your thing</i>

406
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,933
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

407
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,798
- Whoa, watch it.
- Hey!

408
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,702
Art! Honeyman, stop!

409
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,480
I can't tell if he's hurt or not.

410
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,341
Art, are you okay?

411
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:30,444
I was kicking ass
till this chick knocked me down.

412
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,785
She's dangerous.

413
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,256
You okay?

414
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,294
- Yeah, next time use a blinker.
- Ah, yeah.

415
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,309
Wait here.

416
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,176
You're a lousy date.

417
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,322
Are you listening to me?

418
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,825
You wanna repeat that to my face?

419
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,187
- What?
- What did you say?

420
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,025
- What?
- You heard me.

421
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,257
No, I didn't, actually, I'm deaf.

422
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,959
But I can see
what you're saying from over there.

423
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,400
Hey, easy, tiger.
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

424
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,165
First of all, you're eavesdropping
on a private conversation.

425
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,070
Secondly, I can say whatever I want.

426
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,666
Yeah? So can I. You're an asshole.

427
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:26,903
My friend is not a retard.

428
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,913
Actually, he's probably smarter
than the three of us put together.

429
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,505
He's certainly smarter than you.

430
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,346
He's got cerebral palsy.
See, it affects his motor skills.

431
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,250
It means that his brain
is perfectly functioning

432
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,414
while his body is more or less useless.

433
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,616
If you have a little trouble
wrapping your head around that,

434
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,752
think of it as the opposite of you. Asshole.

435
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,197
Who the hell is this guy?

436
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,304
I'm sorry about my friend.

437
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,866
Yeah, I'm sorry for you, he's a jerk.

438
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,741
Sometimes.

439
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,010
You didn't have to threaten him.
That was puerile.

440
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,751
What'd she say?

441
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,719
She said you're a dick.

442
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,047
Oh.

443
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,983
You know what, why don't you
just head back over to your friend?

444
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,118
The two of you deserve each other.

445
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,026
What is your problem?

446
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,458
You believe that?

447
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,469
She's a fox.

448
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,665
You should've asked her out.

449
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,902
What are you talking about?
She just called me a dick.

450
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,843
Actually, she said you were immature.

451
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,004
What?

452
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,107
How come you said "dick"?

453
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,083
Because it was funnier.

454
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:12,505
<i>Sunshine came softly</i>
<i>through my a-window today</i>

455
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,879
<i>Could've tripped out easy</i>
<i>a- but I've a-changed my ways</i>

456
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:26,120
<i>It'll take time, I know it</i>
<i>but in a while</i>

457
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,762
Oh. You.

458
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,599
Yeah, remember me? Immature guy.

459
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,003
Yeah. I got class.

460
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,132
Oh, I'll walk you.

461
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,573
No, thanks.

462
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,111
<i>You're going to be mine</i>

463
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,071
<i>I'll tell you right now</i>

464
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,412
<i>Any trick in the book now, baby</i>

465
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,715
<i>All that I can find</i>

466
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,199
It's sold out.
How are we going to get in, genius?

467
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,432
We'll figure that out.

468
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,839
What if that guy's coming?

469
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,104
Then the two of you can hold hands.
Don't worry about it.

470
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,043
Okay, here she comes.

471
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,154
No. You're Richard?

472
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,851
Oh, my God, this is so trippy.
What are the odds?

473
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,416
Where's your friend? He's not coming?

474
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,326
Nikos? Nah.

475
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,257
Aw, man.

476
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,861
I don't think this is a good idea.

477
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,599
Come on. You need the gas money,
we need the ride.

478
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:47,804
Look, come on, I'll be nice.
I promise. Please?

479
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,272
Yeah, well, if you're mean, I'll leave you.

480
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,910
All right, that sounds fair.
Art, that sound fair to you?

481
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:59,144
- Art thinks that's fair.
- Oh, come on, baby. I'll drive.

482
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,516
<i>I like to dream</i>

483
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:06,324
<i>Yes, yes, right between my sound machine</i>

484
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,527
<i>On a cloud of sound I drift in the night</i>

485
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,831
<i>Any place it goes is right</i>

486
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,635
<i>Goes far, flies near,</i>
<i>to the stars away from here</i>

487
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:21,235
<i>Well, you don't know what we can find</i>

488
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,746
<i>Why don't you come with me, little girl</i>

489
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,873
<i>On a magic carpet ride</i>

490
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,784
<i>You don't know what we can see</i>

491
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,049
<i>Why don't you tell your dreams to me</i>

492
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,250
<i>Fantasy will set you free</i>

493
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,364
Are you guys coming?

494
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,424
Yeah, we'll be right in.

495
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,105
Pardon me.

496
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,799
Hi.

497
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,543
You better not molest me back here.

498
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,812
I have a plan. Bite me.

499
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,147
Do what?

500
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,712
Oh, my God, he's got me! Help!

501
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,987
Help! For the love of God,
somebody help me! Help!

502
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,051
No, no, he's contagious. He'll get you, too.

503
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,221
Go, go get help. Hurry!

504
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:27,337
<i>When the truth is found to be lies</i>

505
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:34,576
<i>And all the joy within you dies</i>

506
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,120
You didn't have a ticket, did you?

507
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,382
Sorry?

508
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,890
You didn't have a ticket, did you?

509
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,550
<i>Don't you need somebody to love?</i>

510
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,824
<i>Wouldrt you love somebody to love?</i>

511
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:50,458
Hey, hey. I really can't see
anything from here.

512
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,230
<i>You better find somebody to love</i>

513
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,466
Hey!

514
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,471
That is so uncool.

515
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,544
<i>Yes, and your mind</i>

516
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,847
Better?

517
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,412
<i>Your mind is so full of red</i>

518
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,983
<i>Don't you want somebody to love?</i>

519
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,552
<i>Don't you need somebody to love?</i>

520
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,474
You knew it was me, didn't you?

521
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,575
All my signs disappeared off the campus
and you're the only one that called.

522
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,986
I like that.

523
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,893
I need to shower.

524
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:29,423
You know, I just can't stop
thinking about last night.

525
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,524
Jesus Christ!

526
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,035
Hey, morning, Tarzan.

527
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:37,063
I'd invite you in, but I don't think
there's room for both of us in here.

528
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,871
- Hey, babe.
- Hey. You remember Richard.

529
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:40,933
Uh-huh.

530
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,306
What, do you guys, like, live together?

531
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,849
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

532
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,976
What, are you guys, like, friends or what?

533
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,848
We have an open relationship.

534
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:57,021
You look a little confused, man.
You need me to draw you a picture?

535
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,828
You just spent the night with me
and you sleep with this guy, too?

536
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,925
I'm not confining myself.

537
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,974
So are you trying to get back at me?

538
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,378
No, Richard, this is my life.

539
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,408
We had fun last night, right?
I like you, but I like Nikos, too.

540
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,845
Yeah, I like you. I like you a lot.

541
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,815
I can't handle this shit.

542
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,425
Richard?

543
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,659
Richard, I know you hear me.

544
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,328
Look, I guess I should've warned you.

545
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,132
Maybe before I looked in the shower.

546
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:45,164
Well, let's just have fun. I mean,
we don't even know what we have yet.

547
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,734
I think what we have
is one too many sausages in the bun.

548
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:53,512
Look, I like to have fun, too,
but your idea of fun is a testicle tag team.

549
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,575
No, that's... Wrong guy.

550
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,887
You're old-fashioned. That's cute.

551
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,654
Am I going to see you again?

552
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,153
Hmm?

553
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,891
Okay.

554
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,736
Here's how this works.

555
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:20,132
If you're with me,
when you're with me, you're with me.

556
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,510
I don't wanna hear about him,
I don't wanna see him,

557
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,550
I don't wanna smell him.

558
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,516
That's fair.

559
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,986
<i>Well, I don't know why I came here tonight</i>

560
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,757
<i>I got the feeling that something ain't right</i>

561
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,025
<i>I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair</i>

562
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,804
<i>And I'm wondering</i>
<i>how I'll get down the stairs</i>

563
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,705
Pass the towel, baby.

564
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:55,108
<i>Clowns to the left of me</i>
<i>Jokers to the right</i>

565
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,910
<i>Here I am</i>
<i>Stuck in the middle with you</i>

566
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:02,544
<i>Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you</i>

567
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,152
<i>And I'm wondering what it is I should do</i>

568
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,524
<i>It's so hard to keep this smile from my face</i>

569
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:14,291
<i>Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place</i>

570
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,198
<i>Clowns to the left of me</i>
<i>Jokers to the right</i>

571
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,761
<i>Here I am</i>
<i>Stuck in the middle with you</i>

572
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,239
<i>Well, you started out with nothing</i>

573
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,708
<i>And you're proud</i>
<i>that you're a self made man</i>

574
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,836
<i>Please</i>

575
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,577
<i>Please</i>

576
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,043
Your grades are excellent.

577
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,981
You're a decorated veteran.

578
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,924
You mind telling me
where you were wounded?

579
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:48,663
I don't usually divulge that information
till the second date.

580
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,927
So what do you wanna do
with your life, Richard?

581
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,565
I wanna help people.
And make a lot of money.

582
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:01,870
Yeah!

583
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,514
After graduation,</i>
<i>I lied about my experience</i>

584
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,884
<i>and got a great job</i>
<i>with an insurance company.</i>

585
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,116
<i>They had no idea I was deaf.</i>

586
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,557
<i>

587
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,940
Right here.

588
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,641
Careful.

589
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,773
Where do you want this?

590
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,875
Yeah, right... Over here.

591
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,851
Hey.

592
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,030
- What do you think?
- I love it.

593
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,932
Nobody's asking for handouts, man.

594
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,995
All these cats here,
they all wanna work, bro.

595
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,633
They just need somebody
to front them, you know?

596
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:11,580
Some buttoned-down asshole who's
already got his nose up the mars ass.

597
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,312
Somebody with a job, bro.

598
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,188
Yeah, somebody like me.

599
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,783
Good idea, bro.

600
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:29,122
<i>I will give you those things</i>
<i>you thought unreal</i>

601
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,963
<i>Follow me now and you will not regret</i>

602
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:45,980
New shirt?

603
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,191
Baby, the phone.

604
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,237
Hello?

605
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,809
Wait, whose birthday?

606
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,659
They better be
the best pancakes on the planet.

607
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,629
Forget it, I'm not hungry anymore.

608
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,462
Oh, that's funny.

609
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,199
- You know what else is funny?
- What?

610
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,367
A guy with CP
rolling down a flight of stairs.

611
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,475
Hey, buddy, can you hold that for...

612
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,846
Thank you, appreciate that.

613
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,436
Hi.

614
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,783
Just here.

615
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,783
Yes, your highness.

616
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,349
- You want your coat on or off?
- Off.

617
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,415
Okay.

618
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,498
All right.

619
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,426
You need a menu?

620
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,605
No, no. I...

621
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,335
I know what I want.

622
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,134
Good evening.

623
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,545
I mean, good morning.

624
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:58,706
Hi.

625
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,148
Hey, we'll just have the pancakes.

626
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,344
Yeah.

627
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,982
Actually, my manager
told me that we can't serve.

628
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,188
- You can't serve pancakes?
- Why? They...

629
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,288
They got them.

630
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,833
Look, I don't want to sound rude...

631
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:21,962
No, no, no. You're not rude, it's...
I'm the only one who understands him.

632
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,241
I'm trying my damnedest
to not make this a scene.

633
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,905
Good. I don't feel there is one.

634
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,078
I think you two need to leave.

635
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,018
You're making the other customers
very uncomfortable.

636
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,312
Oh.

637
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,919
Why?

638
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,885
Hey, we can refuse to serve
whoever we want here.

639
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,089
You gotta be kidding me.

640
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,724
It's my friend's birthday.
All he wants is pancakes.

641
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,667
I... I think

642
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,933
she needs some hot man love.

643
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,707
Maybe. I'll ask her,
but I don't think she's your type, Art.

644
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,505
Okay, don't you dare.

645
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,743
You are the ugliest,
most disgusting thing I have ever seen.

646
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,377
I thought people like you died at birth.

647
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:12,320
How do you expect people
to eat around you?

648
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,482
Normal people
shouldn't even have to look at you.

649
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,889
Listen, lady.

650
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:17,987
I'm

651
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,463
sorry if I'm

652
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,240
doing your job for you.

653
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,977
He says he's very sorry
for turning your customers' stomachs.

654
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,984
- That's obviously your job.
- Yeah.

655
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,647
Okay, you know what?
You guys can leave, or I can call the police.

656
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,212
Oh, oh, wait.

657
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,733
Call them.

658
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:06,875
That night we were arrested for</i>
<i>violating what was known as an Ugly Law.</i>

659
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,913
<i>This law made it a crime</i>
<i>for anyone to appear in public</i>

660
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,381
<i>who was diseased,</i>
<i>maimed or deformed in any way</i>

661
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,941
<i>so as to be</i>
<i>an unsightly or disgusting object.</i>

662
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,413
Hey, hey, buddy.

663
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,321
Watch it, dickwad.

664
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,991
<i>No parkirby the sewer sign</i>
<i>Hot dog, my razors broke</i>

665
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:35,027
<i>Water drippir up the spout</i>
<i>But I don't care, let it all hang out</i>

666
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,304
<i>Let it all hang out</i>

667
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,583
<i>Let it all hang out</i>

668
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,151
<i>Let it all hang out</i>

669
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,156
That horrible waitress</i>
<i>had done me a huge favor.</i>

670
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:03,698
<i>I'd been trying to hide from my past.</i>
<i>She made me embrace it.</i>

671
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,698
<i>I quit my nice, high-paying job</i>
<i>and went to work for a real jerk.</i>

672
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:11,968
<i>Me.</i>

673
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,786
I cold-called every business</i>
<i>in the phone book.</i>

674
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:28,018
<i>I wouldn't take no for an answer.</i>
<i>I found jobs for every vet I knew,</i>

675
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:31,356
<i>and in the process,</i>
<i>I found a life calling for myself.</i>

676
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,992
All right, Richard,
let's see how this sounds.

677
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,339
Dr. Collins,</i>
<i>please call extension 21-10, stat.</i>

678
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,774
<i></i>

679
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:50,040
<i>Dr. Collins, please call extension 21-10.</i>

680
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:53,082
At that time, the only people</i>
<i>vets trusted were other vets,</i>

681
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,176
<i>so I got a job at a government agency</i>
<i>helping them find work.</i>

682
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,153
What is it that you're afraid of,

683
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,290
that he can't work with you,
or that you can't work with him?

684
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,195
You had to stop
and think about that, didn't you?

685
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,326
<i>As soon as I was hired,</i>
<i>Mike said he wanted a job.</i>

686
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,425
<i>Nothing tickled him more</i>

687
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:15,403
<i>than trying to tear down a system</i>
<i>that made no sense to him.</i>

688
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,666
<i>Mike was a natural headhunter.</i>

689
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,571
I'm like Chinese water torture, lady.

690
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:22,100
I'm gonna keep calling you back
till you pull your head out of your ass.

691
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,773
Listen, lady, listen to me.

692
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,748
I left my leg in a rice paddy.

693
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,648
I get a big, fat check every month.

694
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,709
I don't need to be
begging work for these guys.

695
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:31,947
But they need me.

696
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,614
And they need
somebody like you with balls

697
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,784
to give them a freaking chance
to make your company better.

698
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,854
What?

699
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,961
Yeah? Well, amen, sister.

700
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,832
Listen, maybe you and I
could get a drink sometime.

701
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,104
All right, maybe not. All right, take care.

702
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,900
The word was out.</i>

703
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:59,039
<i>I could find jobs for any disabled person,</i>
<i>veteran or otherwise.</i>

704
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:03,052
She's a file clerk and she hasn't missed
a day of work in 20 years.

705
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,611
Sounds good.</i>
- Tell him I'm a dwarf. Tell him.

706
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,121
<i>- Can she start tomorrow?</i>
- Yeah. And she's a dwarf.

707
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,055
<i>- A what?</i>
- A dwarf.

708
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,491
<i>How the hell can a dwarf be a file clerk?</i>

709
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,088
She specializes in L through Z.

710
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:20,162
- I have a step stool, stupid.
- She got a step stool. Come on.

711
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,038
<i>- Okay, I'll give her a shot.</i>
- Right.

712
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,266
<i>- Have her come in tomorrow.</i>
- Great.

713
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,256
Hello?

714
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,529
Is this the Governor's office?

715
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:58,237
Yeah, well, this is Richard Pimentel.
I have a note to return a call.

716
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,468
Okay.

717
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,474
Hello.

718
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,578
Yes, sir.

719
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,347
Well...

720
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,922
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much. I certainly try.

721
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:18,324
'Cause you're an ungrateful piece of shit.
'Cause you're selfish.

722
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,919
What kind of offer?

723
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:20,985
What?

724
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:24,329
What? You wanna fucking take me on?
You wanna take me on, tough guy?

725
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:27,734
Yeah, I would love
to talk about that. Absolutely.

726
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,533
I don't give a shit, man.

727
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,464
Okay. Thank you very much.

728
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,702
Listen, bro, how about
I come down there right now

729
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:36,507
and I beat you to death
with my plastic leg?

730
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,605
What? When?

731
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,375
You can start tomorrow?

732
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,645
He'll be there.

733
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,053
Hey, bro, listen, you're doing
a great thing for a vet, man.

734
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,485
Don't fuck it up.

735
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,368
- To our future.
- Absolutely.

736
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,968
So, when the Governor's office
called me last week...

737
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,476
Whoa. Excuse me?

738
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,604
I guess his office
had heard something about me.

739
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,084
I don't remember the exact words,
but something like innovator or genius.

740
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:18,416
- But you don't remember?
- No, not the exact words.

741
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,115
Anyway, the upshot is

742
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:24,618
they want me to create a program

743
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:28,323
to train employers to hire
and work with the disabled persons.

744
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:32,562
- Seriously? Honey, that's amazing.
- That's what I thought.

745
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:33,933
What were they doing before?

746
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,666
There is no before.
This is the first time they've done this.

747
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,732
- I'd be starting from scratch.
- Well, you little groundbreaker, you.

748
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,073
You heard about this for a week
and you never told me?

749
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,478
Well, I didn't know
it was going to be definite yet.

750
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:48,608
And the bad news is
I'd have to quit my job.

751
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,119
But the good news is,
is that once the program was created,

752
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:54,315
they wanna send me around
the country and train all the trainers.

753
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,790
So the good news is you'll be traveling?

754
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,887
Yeah. If you want to,
you could come with me for some of it.

755
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,731
What's wrong?

756
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,567
I just... Nothing. Nothing.

757
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,933
Well, come on, you seem bummed.

758
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,532
I'm not bummed. It's...

759
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,338
It's just that I hardly see you now as it is,

760
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,042
so what's it going to be like
when you start traveling?

761
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:23,574
No, no. This... Look,
this is a completely different job. Okay?

762
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,644
When I'm in town, I'm gonna be at home.

763
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,683
I've been working a lot lately
and you've been really great about that.

764
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,227
This is a really big deal.

765
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:34,757
I know.

766
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,233
Okay. I'm proud of you.

767
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,938
So when are you gonna tell Mike
you're leaving?

768
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,576
Mike's the hardest worker you got, okay?
He's a little bit volatile.

769
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,840
He's a ticking time bomb.

770
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,280
He's effective.
That's the important thing, right?

771
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,318
He's completely out of control.

772
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,986
What happens when you're not here
to baby-sit him?

773
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,490
As it is, no one wants to work with him.

774
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,050
The people that he got work for
will work with him.

775
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:09,121
Look, I'll talk to him. This job is his life.

776
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,632
I don't care.

777
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,334
I want him gone.

778
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,779
I'm on time, bro. I'm never late.

779
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,010
I wear nice clothes.

780
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,280
Who's placed more people than me,
even more than you?

781
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,720
No doubt, I know.

782
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:38,024
You got an unorthodox style, man.
It makes management nervous.

783
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,823
So when are you leaving, man?

784
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,058
I go in a week.

785
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,097
Fucking A, brother. You're gonna be great.

786
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,297
Thanks.

787
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,339
Look, man, I don't have to do this
if you're not...

788
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,811
No, don't worry about me.

789
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,815
I'm a survivor, brother. I'm gonna be fine.

790
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,276
Yeah.

791
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:29,769
<i>Sometimes late when things are real</i>

792
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:35,807
<i>And people share the gift of gab</i>
<i>between themselves</i>

793
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,785
<i>Some are quick to take the bait</i>

794
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,587
<i>And catch the perfect prize</i>

795
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,595
They wanted me to write</i>
<i>the book on hiring the disabled.</i>

796
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,497
<i>I finally had something to say,</i>
<i>I just didn't know how to say it.</i>

797
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,627
<i>But oz never did give nothing</i>
<i>to the tin man</i>

798
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:58,201
<i>That he didn't, didn't already have</i>

799
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:04,013
<i>And cause never was the reason</i>
<i>for the evening</i>

800
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:09,050
Come on, guys.
Now, I don't wanna see text in your eyes.

801
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,143
Has he told you yet you're full of shit?

802
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,883
'Cause if you're any good he will, trust me.

803
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,797
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet Richard Pimentel,

804
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,594
the best student I never had.

805
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,831
That's all for today, thank you.

806
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,868
<i>Tilting at Windmills.</i> You a Quixote fan?

807
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:33,731
Yeah.

808
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,779
I was reading it one night
and I had an epiphany.

809
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,678
You know, the hardest thing
about being disabled

810
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,808
is the way that other people treat you.

811
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,349
Employers, they don't wanna
hire people with disability.

812
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,820
Why is that?

813
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,983
They lack confidence in us.

814
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:54,727
- I think you may have that wrong.
- What do you mean?

815
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,766
You don't need to change their minds
about people's disabilities,

816
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,928
you need to change their minds
about themselves.

817
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,233
I wanna show you something.

818
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,610
- Lithium?
- Yeah.

819
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,247
I'm what they call a manic-depressive.

820
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,121
That medicine you're holding
allows me to function.

821
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,125
I don't share that with a lot of people.

822
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,354
For years,
I didn't wanna accept what I was.

823
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,032
The day you auditioned for me
was not a good day.

824
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,268
No, I got a life 'cause of you.

825
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,464
- You could've lost it because of me.
- I make my own decisions.

826
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,535
I lost my hearing.

827
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,807
I gained a superpower, lip-reading.

828
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,111
I can spy on conversations
a hundred feet away.

829
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,648
I could have some fun with that
at those god-awful faculty lunches.

830
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,887
- So you don't wear hearing aids?
- No, they don't help.

831
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:03,229
I get them from the government, but I just
pass them out like candy for Halloween.

832
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:08,300
Do me a favor,
I want you to meet someone.

833
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,883
- Richard?
- Yeah.

834
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,924
Bill Austin. Come on back with me.

835
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,285
- Right in here, please.
- All right.

836
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,021
No offense,
but this is all kind of a circle jerk.

837
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,068
I'm just here to humor Ben.

838
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,002
See, I have this ritual with Uncle Sam
every year where he tells me

839
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,039
how much more deaf I am
than the year before,

840
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:45,802
and then I cash his disability checks.

841
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,536
Well, there doesn't seem to be
too much purpose

842
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,909
in living a life with a hearing problem
if we can find the right solution.

843
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,277
Wait, wait.
What are you gonna do with that thing?

844
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,906
I'm going to stick it in your ear,

845
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,645
unless you have another place
you'd rather I stick it.

846
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,918
Ear's good.

847
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,161
Now we're ready to try
the new hearing aids.

848
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,788
Is that them?

849
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,732
They're like a contact lens for the ear.

850
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,928
We've found that
smaller's better.

851
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,700
We get a more efficient coupling
for the ear when the aid is in the canal.

852
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,401
<i></i>

853
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,502
Can you hear me, Richard?

854
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,643
How does it sound? Can you hear me?

855
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,048
<i></i>

856
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:30,710
Can you hear me?

857
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,488
Oh, yeah. That's great.

858
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:53,005
<i>Wash away my troubles</i>
<i>Wash away my pain</i>

859
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,603
<i>With the rain in Shambala</i>

860
01:01:56,779 --> 01:02:00,112
<i>Wash away my sorrow</i>
<i>Wash away my shame</i>

861
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,118
Once I started writing again,</i>
<i>it was like I tapped a vein.</i>

862
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,121
<i>My central focus was</i>
<i>to change the attitudes of employers</i>

863
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,453
<i>about persons with all disabilities.</i>

864
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,719
<i>It took me a year to write.</i>

865
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:16,393
<i>Ah, ooh, yeah</i>

866
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,697
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

867
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:23,569
<i>Everyone is helpful</i>
<i>Everyone is kind</i>

868
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,268
<i>On the road to Shambala</i>

869
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:31,211
<i>Everyone is lucky</i>
<i>Everyone is so kind</i>

870
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,978
<i>On the road to Shambala</i>

871
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,620
What page are you on right now?

872
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,422
I'm on page shut the fuck up.

873
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,182
I've got CP, I'm not deaf.

874
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,453
All right, come in.

875
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,296
Come on, man. Say something.

876
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:37,479
Why did you want me to read this?

877
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,274
'Cause I don't think
I know what I'm doing, Art.

878
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:45,184
But I never would've written that
if I hadrt met you.

879
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,289
Now, you're the smartest guy that I know,

880
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:51,485
and if you don't think that's any good,
I'm just gonna tear it up.

881
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,225
You don't have

882
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,068
a clue...

883
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,436
- All right, shit.
- No, let me finish.

884
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:12,706
You don't have a clue how good this is.

885
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:21,789
You know what we cripples want

886
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,918
besides getting laid?

887
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,462
To be seen.

888
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:32,167
When they look at me out there now,

889
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,035
you know what they see?

890
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:38,801
Nothing.

891
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,408
I'm ignored.

892
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,275
How can you ignore this?

893
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,874
But they ignore me,

894
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,343
because

895
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:57,454
I am so disturbing

896
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:02,190
to their definition of human,

897
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,824
that I make them feel.

898
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:11,639
I love that.

899
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:16,611
What you've created

900
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:22,246
will help to make them see us.

901
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:28,514
If you try to tear this up,

902
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,717
I'll kick your ass.

903
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:36,720
All right.

904
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,461
<i>

905
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,662
I threw myself into my career.</i>

906
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,765
<i>I was changing lives and ignoring my own.</i>

907
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:51,774
<i>I was keynote speaker for</i>
<i>the US government, training every agency.</i>

908
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:56,443
<i>CIA, NASA, the VA, all of them.</i>

909
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,215
<i>My own subversive little goal</i>
<i>was to make the federal government</i>

910
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,655
<i>into the biggest employer</i>
<i>of disabled persons in the country.</i>

911
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,658
<i>Mike would've dug the irony.</i>

912
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,965
Richard, we made plans
for this months ago.

913
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,371
Why did you wait till now
to tell me you can't go?

914
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:23,310
- I just forgot all about it. I'm sorry.
- So tell them that.

915
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,143
It's an important conference,
I'm the speaker.

916
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,547
I can't just not show up,
people count on me.

917
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,141
And I don't?

918
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:33,655
They're strangers at a convention,
an audience.

919
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,917
They applaud, you eat it up.

920
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,687
So I have to wonder,
are you doing this for them or for you?

921
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,752
I'm doing it for them
and I'm doing it for me.

922
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,699
We'll do something special
when I get back.

923
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,562
Okay?

924
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,634
Richard, this is important to me.
I'm asking you not to go.

925
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:58,407
Stop it! I am not doing this right now.

926
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,283
I'll call you from the hotel.

927
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:18,356
<i>Until you've seen</i>
<i>this trash can dream come true</i>

928
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:25,230
<i>You stand at the edge</i>
<i>while people run you through</i>

929
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,038
<i>And I thank the lord</i>

930
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:33,710
<i>There's people out there like you</i>

931
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,843
<i>I thank the lord</i>

932
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:39,979
<i>There's people out there like you</i>

933
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,390
<i>While Mona Lisas and mad hatters</i>

934
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:52,195
<i>Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers</i>

935
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:57,732

936
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:03,136
<i>For unless they see the sky</i>

937
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:12,449
Hey, baby, it's me.
I know it's late, but pick up if you're there.

938
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,885
Hello? Just wanna say that</i>

939
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,086
<i>today went really well</i>

940
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:24,294
<i>and I wanted to see how you were doing</i>

941
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:27,767
and tell you that I miss you a lot.

942
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,198
And...

943
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,602
Pick up if you're there
'cause I really wanted to tell you that I...

944
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,906
<i></i>

945
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,646
I think I messed up.

946
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,969
Christine?

947
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,074
Christine?

948
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:33,763
Oh, boy.

949
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:36,661
The minute I turn my back,
you come sniffing around.

950
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:39,536
You just don't get it, do you?

951
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:42,270
Just go get Christine
before I have your visa revoked.

952
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:44,705
It's okay, Nikos.

953
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,021
You've been seeing him behind my back?

954
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,030
No. I'm just here until I find my own place.

955
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,963
I'm not getting back with Nikos.

956
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,969
- Does he know that?
- Of course.

957
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,532
You two sleeping
in the same bed together?

958
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:13,700
- Jesus. You don't get it.
- What?

959
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,773
I just want you to come home.

960
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,640
- I'm not coming home.
- Why?

961
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:24,185
Is this because
I don't give you enough attention?

962
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:27,450
No, it's because
I don't give me enough attention.

963
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:29,081
I've always depended on men like you

964
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:31,888
to make me feel better
and take care of me.

965
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,258
I need to be on my own.

966
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,059
All right, well, be on your own.
Be on your own with me.

967
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:40,165
I mean, I'm traveling,
I can give you all the space you want.

968
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:44,603
I'm flailing here, okay?
I don't know what you want me to say.

969
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:49,340
- I love you. I wanna be with you.
- You don't wanna be with me.

970
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,680
You just wanna win me and put me
on a shelf to remind you that you won me.

971
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:59,585
That's not a relationship, Richard,
I think we need to be apart.

972
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,720
I need to figure out who I am and...

973
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:07,990
And I think you need to figure out
what's important to you, too.

974
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,210
Margaret, you have a visitor.

975
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:29,879
Hi, Mom.

976
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,814
How you feeling?

977
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,924
The doctors tell me I'm doing well.

978
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:46,456
But I don't feel like it, and neither do I.

979
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,639
Schizophrenia humor. That's good, Mom.

980
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,002
You know what I miss?

981
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:58,378
Dancing.

982
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:02,682
You know who was a good dancer?
Richard.

983
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,815
Not really.

984
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:11,155
He took foxtrot, cha-cha, tango lessons.

985
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,428
I used to take him to the nightclubs.

986
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,828
Oh, we had so much fun.

987
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,890
No, Mom, actually, I didn't.

988
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:22,095
No 12-year-old boy
really wants ballroom dancing lessons.

989
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,832
That's a lie.

990
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:31,010
- Why'd you do it for two years?
- So that I could be with you.

991
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:42,449
I wanna take a nap now.

992
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:48,127
- But your son came so far to visit you.
- That's all right.

993
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,927
That's all right. That's okay, it's fine.

994
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:56,769
Here, I wanna give you something.

995
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:01,503
This is a new standard for disability
training for employers nationwide,

996
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:03,101
and I wrote it.

997
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,513
I don't feel like reading anything.

998
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,614
Well, I just wanna tell you, Mom,
I'm doing great.

999
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,319
I love my job, I'm making a difference.

1000
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:23,791
What do you want?

1001
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,597
You want me to pat your hand,
say you're a good boy?

1002
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,661
I'm not wired that way.

1003
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:48,220
The average able-bodied person
doesn't give a damn about the disabled.

1004
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,781
Would we care about womers rights
if they hadrt mobilized?

1005
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:53,293
We're not gonna care about
disabled people

1006
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,763
until they set aside their differences,
stop being invisible,

1007
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:59,130
and come together
for the passage of the ADA.

1008
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,260
That would be the Americans
with Disabilities Act, am I right?

1009
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,099
Yes, exactly,
Americans with Disabilities Act.

1010
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,835
This bill, simply put, says that
you can't discriminate against people

1011
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:09,434
simply because they don't look like you.

1012
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,911
Okay. Why don't we hold that thought
right there until...

1013
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,278
Now that the election
has come down to Bush and Dukakis,

1014
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,146
I have it on very good authority

1015
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,676
that the very first candidate who
comes out publicly in support of the ADA

1016
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:22,622
is gonna get the disabled vote.
The whole thing, all of it.

1017
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:25,751
Everybody, which is
millions of votes for the first candidate

1018
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,693
that has the balls
to come out and support this.

1019
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:29,628
- Richard, please, just...
- One second.

1020
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:35,295
Rumor has it that one of our senior
elected officials was told by his advisors,

1021
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,203
okay, "Sir, we have a problem.

1022
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,763
"There is a horrific disease.

1023
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:43,903
"It is infecting homosexuals
and drug addicts at an alarming rate,

1024
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,776
"and it is always fatal."

1025
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,214
And you know what he said?
You know what his reply was?

1026
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:51,184
He said,
"What did you say the problem was?"

1027
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,918
That is the kind of Nazi Germany
mentality that we're looking at

1028
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:59,392
here in America, in the late 20th century.

1029
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:02,624
That's it. We're off the air, all right?

1030
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:08,093
Somewhere along the way</i>
<i>I realized my heart wasrt driving me.</i>

1031
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,637
<i>My anger was.</i>

1032
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,506
<i>I think Art noticed it first.</i>

1033
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,776
You're a complete asshole.

1034
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:21,916
You used to be a partial one,
but you graduated.

1035
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,883
How the hell did you get in here?

1036
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,513
When you're not looking, I can walk.

1037
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:34,989
So you're too busy
to see your friends anymore?

1038
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:38,396
Too deaf to hear the phone ring?

1039
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,662
You know what?
Don't bring your wobbling ass in here

1040
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,796
and try and guilt-trip me, all right?
You know who I lectured last week?

1041
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,861
I do.

1042
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,738
The CIA, man. Fucking CIA.

1043
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,572
I'm doing great.

1044
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,239
But you don't look great.

1045
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,446
Yeah? Well, who's this?

1046
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,753
"But you don't look great."

1047
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,966
Who's this?

1048
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,743
<i></i>

1049

Mike.

1055
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:49,696
<i>Like you had survived hell and from</i>

1056

01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:58,139

01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:00,948
<i>Later, bro.</i>

01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,824
Mike. Mike. Hey.

1061
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:27,533
Shit.

It's Bush. Bush, Bush, Bush.

1068
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,606
If Bush wins, you know what that means?

1069
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,547
That means I'm gonna have to
renovate this whole place

1070
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,050
just to service these retards.

1071
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,380
You know what that's gonna cost me?

1072
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:13,250
No, what's it gonna cost you?

1073
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:17,280
I'm just talking about
this Disabilities Act, it's gonna...

1074
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,054
Yeah, what's it gonna cost you?

1075
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,823
It means I have to put in ramps,
I have to put in all these kinds of things.

1076
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,525
It's gonna wind up...
It's gonna be a big deficit.

1077
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:28,933
Right. You might have to spend, what,
$1,000 to get a wheelchair ramp

1078
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,802
and widen a toilet stall
so somebody can take a piss?

1079
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,567
Sir...

1080
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,636
I don't mean anything by it, all right...

1081
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,112
Yeah, you do.
I'm one of those retards, okay.

1082
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:40,739
I lost my hearing in the war.

1083
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:43,580
You wanna talk about
how much that's gonna cost you?

1084
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:48,655
Tell you what, go ahead.
Go ahead, talk about it, all right?

1085
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:52,116
I won't listen. Say something funny.

1086
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,123
Tell him.

1087
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:57,197
Why don't you tell him a joke
about a guy who's got a 180 IQ

1088
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,428
but he a has a brain disorder
so he can't tie his shoe?

1089
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,526
Huh?

1090
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:05,471
Or a world-class skier who breaks her neck
and now she needs a machine to breathe?

1091
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,440
That's funny stuff.

1092
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,807
And poor you, 'cause now you gotta
sink a little bit of money

1093
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:12,779
into this piece-of-shit restaurant.

1094
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:16,746
You know what? Here you go.

1095
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:22,621
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Buy yourself a conscience.

1096
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:31,729
Richard? Richard, it's me.

1097
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,262
Hey, Christine.

1098
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:36,304
It's been a while. How are you?

1099
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,931
Good, yeah, I'm just...
I'm meeting some friends.

1100
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:42,969
So are you still
leading seminars, traveling...

1101
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:44,534
Yeah. Yeah, it's good,

1102
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,104
- it's going really well.
- Yeah? I'm glad. How's Art?

1103
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,878
The same old Art. Is that your husband?

1104
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:51,743
No.

1105
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,521
No? You know, it's strange to see you.

1106
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:01,061
I was thinking about you
just the other day.

1107
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:05,327
Thinking about you a lot, actually.
I... Well...

1108
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,698
I was remembering the trip to Seattle.

1109
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:10,260
I'm engaged. He's my fianc.

1110
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:14,205
Well, is it hot in here
or is my life going up in flames?

1111
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:16,710
- Richard...
- I'm kidding.

1112
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:20,043
Well, I'm gonna go.

1113
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,751
Are you okay?

1114
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:26,816
Yeah, absolutely.

1115
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,922
He's just an old friend.

1116
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,824
<i></i>

1117
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:44,235
Mr. Pimentel, it is urgent that you</i>
<i>call us back regarding your mother.</i>

1118
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:47,070
<i></i>

1119
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:10,727
I'm right here, man.</i>

1120
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,670
Richard, open the door!

1121
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:25,243
- Hey.
- There's a gas leak. Can't you smell that?

1122
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,448
What are you doing, Richard?

1123
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:41,694
Why would you do that?

1124
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:45,528
She died.

1125
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:49,602
My mother finally died.

1126
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:58,910
It's okay.

1127
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:11,086
It's hot.

1128
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,858
I feel like an idiot.

1129
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:20,197
All the shit I've dealt with,
and the thing that gets me

1130
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:24,170
is I can't get some mentally ill woman
I barely know to ever love me.

1131
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,970
Well, that's not your fault.
She's the one that was damaged.

1132
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,709
And she missed being close
to a really great person.

1133
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:36,648
What are you doing here, anyway?

1134
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:41,014
I was worried about you.
And I came to thank you.

1135
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,355
If not for you, I wouldn't be
as happy as I am now.

1136
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:49,657
I don't think that's a compliment.

1137
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,631
No, it is, it is.

1138
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,931
I learned a lot from you.
And I came to apologize.

1139
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:01,105
I never told you how glad I am
that you're a part of my life.

1140
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,571
So after spending my whole life
trying to prove myself

1141
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,978
to someone that was not capable
of accepting me,

1142
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:11,212
I finally realized I actually had something
in common with my mother,

1143
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:14,346
that neither of us much cared
whether or not I lived.

1144
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:16,253
But I didn't like that.

1145
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:19,316
So I did what she could never do.

1146
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:21,891
I accepted myself.

1147
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:24,387
Two years ago,

1148
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:28,197
the Americans with Disabilities Act
was passed through Congress.

1149
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:30,669
And last week it became a reality.

1150
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:36,866
Congratulations. You did that.

1151
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:46,020
My teacher, Mr. Parks, would say
that I've been able to find my music.

1152
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:49,454
Now does that mean that
I became a superhero? No, I don't think so.

1153
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:52,857
Although, I do like to wear spandex
and a cape around the house sometimes.

1154
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:59,423
The differences that you make
that are the ones of lasting importance,

1155
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:05,338
they're the little differences that
you make in the life of another person.

1156
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:08,638
And all of these people
that I got to tell you about tonight,

1157
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,577
they all made a difference in my life,

1158
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:15,104
and I can only hope that somehow
I made a difference in theirs.

1159
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:21,122
And that after years and years and years
of trying to become larger than life,

1160
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:25,518
I'm now working on maybe
being a little smaller.

1161
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:32,666
Hey, you're late.

1162
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,099
Blow me, Ironsides.

1163
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:40,367
Last one in pays.

1164
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,345
All right, easy there, Andretti.

1165
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,651
Come on, cowboy.

1166
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:00,250
Two?
Please.

1167
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:01,625
Follow me.

1168
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,489
Is this one okay?

1169
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:06,693
Yeah, if you're big tippers.

1170
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:11,735
He's paying,
but he's a cheap son of a bitch.

1171
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:15,833
But if you play your cards right,

1172
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:21,041
you could have a ride on my chair, baby.

1173
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,944
He says I'm buying
and I'm a cheap son of a bitch,

1174
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:28,182
but if you play your cards right,
you can have a ride in his chair.

1175
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:31,384
Honey, only if you promise to go real fast.

1176
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,532
No, thank you.
I think we know what we want.

1177
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,160
Yeah.

1178
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,401
You got a live one, Honeyman.

1179
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:45,905
Yeah.

1180
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,466
Here you go.

1181
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:53,907
Thank you.

1182
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,473
Well, that's the slowest service
I've ever seen.

1183
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:59,213
It only took us 20 years to get these.

1184
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,449
Be cool.

1185
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:07,461
You're gonna get us arrested again.

1186
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:12,929
And I probably wouldn't mind.

1187
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:25,841
I think he likes it.

1188
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:28,740
Oh, yeah.

1189
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:36,348
So, I guess this one's mine, huh?

1190
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:39,689
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1191
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:41,092
You've gotta be kidding me.

1192
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:44,427
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1193
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:48,765
<i>Happy birthday, dear Richard</i>

1194

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1195
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:58,010
Hey, come on, make a wish.

1196
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:03,839
Yeah.

1197
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:14,059
- Hey, Richard.
- Yeah?

1198
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:20,226
There's something
I have always wanted to ask you.

1199
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:21,359
What's that?

1200
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:24,599
Does this wheelchair

1201
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:29,536
make my butt look big?

1202
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:32,611
I'll see you around, Art.

1203
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,874
Yeah.

1205
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:26,059

1206
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:30,596
<i>Why am I knocking on your door?</i>

1207
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:37,141
<i>It never opened for me before</i>

1208
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:41,240
<i>Up against the glass</i>

1209
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,807
<i>I wonder what it's like</i>

1210
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:47,184
<i>For ordinary people</i>

1211
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,850
<i>Running through your life</i>

1212
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:54,224

1221
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,590
<i>I thought I heard you say</i>

1222
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:35,193
<i>You wish you'd never come</i>

1223
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:40,000
<i>Tearing through the time</i>

1224
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:45,637
