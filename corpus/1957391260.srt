1
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,208
Mustafar.

2
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:34,583
From its fiery depths I rose
just as my new castle rises

3
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:39,208
as the ultimate testimony
to the awesome power of the dark side!

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,250
So... What do you think?

5
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,167
A little on the nose
is what I think.

6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,250
I mean, you can say evil fortress
on the hill without saying it, you know?

7
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,583
Look at this place,

8
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,083
you could really
use something, anything...

9
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,583
A chair, perhaps.

10
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,500
Anywho, no time to sit around.
We've got a galaxy to conquer.

11
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,958
-Master!
-Gah! Who is that? Who are you?

12
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:10,667
Vaneé is but the humble servant
to Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith.

13
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,958
I've prepared your bath, master.

14
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:22,125
Conquer now, tubby time later. Let's go.

15
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,500
- But my castle...
- Fine.

16
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,833
You. Darth Hideous.
Keep an eye on the place.

17
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:32,583
It would be
Vaneé's honor to serve...

18
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,667
What are you, the last five guys
in the galaxy to get the news?

19
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,708
The First Order is destroyed.

20
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:59,500
The war is over. You lost! Go home!

21
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,833
Okay, suit yourself.

22
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,667
I'm not scared of these bucketheads!

23
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,042
Watch this!

24
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,750
Like taking candy
from a baby porg.

25
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,458
Now let's go home!

26
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't be such a worry wampa! I got this.

27
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:33,917
Okay, still got this.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,500
I just need to make an emergency landing
on that bright red lava planet.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,750
I got this, I got this,

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,875
I got this.

31
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,625
See? Told ya, I got this.

32
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:03,167
We'll just call for help and...

33
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,167
Comm's dead. Hmm.

34
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,750
Okay, no biggie.

35
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,542
Come on. Let's go find some help.

36
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,792
I was not showing off!
That TIE got off a lucky shot!

37
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,875
Oh, I bet we can find help there!

38
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,667
Okay, you can stay here alone...
In these dark, creepy woods.

39
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,500
That's what I thought.

40
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,833
What is this place?

41
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:45,833
-Hello? Excuse me?
-Gah!

42
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,500
Don't sneak up on a guy
like that, will you?

43
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,958
I got a condition, you know?

44
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,375
Oh, sorry. What are you buildin' here?

45
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,042
Castle Vader!

46
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:59,708
The galaxy's first all-inclusive,
Sith-inspired luxury theme resort.

47
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:04,750
A place for fun-lovin', free-spending
families from across the galaxy

48
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,792
to finally indulge
in their inner dark side!

49
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,000
What do you think?

50
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,375
You're building a hotel.

51
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,375
-In Darth Vader's old castle.
-Mmm-hmm.

52
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,375
No offense, but that sounds
like a really bad idea, Mr... um...

53
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,791
Graballa! The Hutt!

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,583
Legendary entrepreneur?
Real estate tycoon?

55
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,208
Um...

56
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:29,250
Cousin of the late Jabba,
may he rest in peace.

57
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,083
And you are who exactly?

58
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,167
Poe Dameron.

59
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,250
Poe Dameron!

60
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,042
The fearless pilot
who destroyed Starkiller Base

61
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,125
and led the Resistance on Exegol?

62
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,667
I mean,
a lot of folks helped... But, uh, yes.

63
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,792
It is an honor, General.

64
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,708
Please, allow me to give you a tour.

65
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,583
Raam, Baash...
Help the gentleman with his luggage.

66
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,958
Oh, no, no, that's not my lugg... Okay.

67
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:01,667
We've been working around the clock
and I've spared no expense.

68
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,458
Castle Vader is gonna be class
all the way.

69
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,917
Lava fountain. We got one.

70
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,167
So... My X-wing took some damage
back there and...

71
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,708
And wait'll you see the lobby!

72
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:18,625
General, are you familiar
with the term, "celebrity endorsement"?

73
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,750
A stranger enters.

74
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,875
Could they finally be the one
to fulfill the Prophecy of Mustafar?

75
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,167
A fearless pilot arrives

76
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,958
with the strength to unlock
the treasures of my master's castle?

77
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,292
Perhaps...

78
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,375
The troopers set the mood
the second you walk in.

79
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,667
And I got 'em all.

80
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,625
Storm, shore, scout, snow, death...

81
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,750
Even my own creation, the skelo-trooper.

82
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,792
Feel the power of the dark side...

83
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,667
Of the dark side... Of the dark side...
Of the dark side...

84
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,667
Ow! I'll show you a dark side!

85
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,250
Um, excuse me, Mr. The Hutt?
I might be able to fix it.

86
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,208
I highly doubt that.

87
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,708
All right, go ahead, kid.

88
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:16,917
So, what do you say? Ready to be
Castle Vader's official S-Poe-ksman?

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,125
You see what I did with your name there?

90
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,667
I put the Poe in spokesman!

91
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,458
Feel the power of the dark side...

92
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:27,125
at the Empire Emporium! Now open.

93
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,083
-Oh, you've got skills, kid.
-Thank you, sir, I...

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,250
Hey! You... You're...

95
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,333
Hi. Poe Dameron. What's your name?

96
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:44,833
I'm Dean! I can't believe
I'm meeting the Poe Dameron!

97
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,000
You're the best pilot in the galaxy!

98
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:51,458
Oh, I don't know about "best."
Maybe top three. Or two.

99
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,250
You're pretty good with those tools.

100
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,625
I could use some help fixing my X-wing.

101
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:59,458
Me, fix your X-wing? I'd be honored!

102
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,375
I wanna be a pilot too someday,
and you know...

103
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,792
The grown-ups are talking.

104
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,542
So, it looks like we each
have something the other wants.

105
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,375
So I'll make you a deal.

106
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:15,917
You record a holovid for Castle Vader,
and I'll have the kid fix your X-wing.

107
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,792
After my X-wing is running.
You're not the first Hutt I've dealt with.

108
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,333
-Come on, kid.
-No!

109
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,833
The fearless pilot mustn't leave.

110
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:29,833
Vaneé! What've I told you
about sneaking up on people?

111
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,125
Sorry. He came with the place.

112
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,917
Sort of a creepy caretaker.
Emphasis on "creepy." Just ignore him.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,750
Hmm...

114
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,208
- Uh, that's kinda tough.
- Hmm...

115
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:43,792
Okay, Vaneé.
We've talked about sniffing the guests.

116
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,875
Boys...

117
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,667
But Vaneé has something
to show the brave pilot.

118
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,167
Some other time. We're kind of in a rush.

119
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,000
NI-L8, show them.

120
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,500
Behold, The Helmet of Ren!

121
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,542
Did you say Ren? As in Kylo?

122
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,458
This helmet belonged
to the one who helped create him.

123
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:08,292
Would you like to hear its tale?

124
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,208
The man said he's in a rush!

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Tell me.

126
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:22,083
This is the tale of a powerful warrior
who longed for more...

127
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:29,250
Excellent, Ben.

128
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:32,832
This is such
a waste of time, Uncle Luke.

129
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,292
I'm so much stronger than all of them.

130
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:41,332
Patience. There are no shortcuts
to becoming a Jedi.

131
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:45,042
How is this lame rock-stacking
gonna make me a great Jedi?

132
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,750
I sense your frustration, nephew.

133
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:52,083
Really? Wow!
Did you use the Force to sense that?

134
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,917
He'll be fine, R2.
He just has more to learn.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,708
Master Skywalker! I think I did it!

136
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,333
Oh! Ow!

137
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,292
Every time with you, Cozler!

138
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:09,417
- "No shortcuts to becoming a Jedi."
- Hey!

139
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,458
How long did he train on Dagobah?
Like, 20 minutes?

140
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,458
The Knights of Ren are coming!
Be afraid! Be very afraid!

141
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,542
Knights of Ren, feast on their fear!

142
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:30,625
Take all that you want!

143
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,208
See you around, kid. Let's roll!

144
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,292
Join us, Ben.

145
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,042
Solo... Join us, Ben.

146
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:19,833
Don't listen to him, Ben.

147
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,708
Stay out of it, Skywalker!

148
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:24,708
Power is yours for the taking, Solo.

149
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,792
We're doing dream sequences now?

150
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,083
Sorry to interrupt, son,

151
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,833
Mom and I were wondering
if you're coming homing for dinner...

152
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:35,333
Chewie made your favorite.
Roast Tip-Yip in Bantha sauce.

153
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,000
Join us, Ben.

154
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,917
Stay on the path, Ben.

155
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:55,958
Solo...

156
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:05,208
Solo... Solo... Solo.

157
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,417
You aren't Jedi. Are you Sith?

158
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,042
The Knights of Ren live by our own code.

159
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,292
Use our power to take what we want.

160
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,667
You have skills.

161
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,333
Yet you follow that fossil Skywalker
when you could have so much more.

162
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,833
You could be one of us.

163
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,167
Or are you afraid?

164
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,833
Yeah!

165
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,000
Not in those old rags.

166
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,292
The Knights of Ren
have a reputation to keep.

167
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,167
Really? Not again.

168
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,042
Would you please...
Could you just... This isn't funny.

169
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,917
You got the knight fever, Ben!

170
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,042
Yeah! Play that kloo horn!

171
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,250
- He's so good.
- You're moving like a real champ.

172
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,417
Whoo!

173
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,958
That was so fun! I am in!

174
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:28,333
No, no, no.
There's still the initiation.

175
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,792
Uh... Wasn't the beach dancing
the initiation?

176
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,958
My uncle's lightsaber. How did you get...

177
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,958
I told you. We take what we want.

178
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,125
Now, take what you want.

179
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,333
To create a Knight of Ren
requires destruction.

180
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,792
Destroy what Skywalker has built
and you will be free.

181
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,333
No... I don't know.

182
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,667
Don't waste
your time with him, Ren.

183
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,250
The kid's a total Kylo.

184
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,333
Kylo?

185
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:05,958
Yeah, Kylo. Small. Weak. Scared.

186
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:10,917
Kylo... Kylo... Kylo... Kylo...

187
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,708
I'm not scared! I'm not a Kylo!

188
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,667
Then take what you want.

189
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:21,625
What I want is for you to leave me alone!

190
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,125
Wrong choice, kid.

191
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,208
Knights of Ren, destroy the Temple!

192
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,542
Destroy the Temple.
Yeah!

193
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,083
Ow!

194
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,000
Power was yours for the taking.

195
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,833
But you're too scared... Kylo.

196
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:05,542
Keep calling me that.
I'm starting to like it!

197
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,167
Rock stacking. Go figure.

198
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,458
Ben?

199
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:32,958
-Ben!
-No, Uncle Luke. Call me...

200
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,417
Kylo.

201
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,500
And that night was Kylo Ren's
first step on his path to power!

202
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,708
And how did that work out for him?

203
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,333
What was even the point of that story?
To scare us?

204
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,542
It worked!

205
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,417
No.

206
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,833
To remind you that there is much
to be taken by those unafraid to take it.

207
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:05,917
Sith artifacts
lie beyond this door.

208
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,792
The Prophecy of Mustafar

209
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:14,500
foretells the arrival of a fearless
stranger with the strength to open it.

210
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:19,417
Perhaps, a brave pilot
who has fought many battles?

211
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,958
Sounds like my cue.

212
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,250
What about your X-wing?

213
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,000
If there's even a small chance
Vaneé is telling the truth,

214
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,125
there's no way I'm letting a Hutt
get his slimy hands on Sith artifacts.

215
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,500
Come on. Give me a hand.

216
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,875
Yes... Follow Vaneé!

217
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,708
Much to see. Much to find...
Come on!

218
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,125
Monster!

219
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,792
Would you bantha brains focus?

220
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,167
I mean, look at all this space!

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,917
We can add a business center and a gym!

222
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,167
You said you want to be a pilot.

223
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,708
So, how'd you wind up
on Graballa's clean-up detail?

224
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,583
You saving for a ship or something?

225
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:35,583
For my family. My mom was a mechanic.
We had a shop on Arkanis.

226
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,833
Had a shop? What happened?

227
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:41,875
The First Order accused her of helping
the Resistance and destroyed it.

228
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,708
People got scared
and wouldn't hire her anymore.

229
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:48,250
- So now it's all on you.
- Yeah.

230
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:53,125
I'm afraid if I lose this job,
my family has nothing.

231
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:58,833
Hey, I get it.
I had a tough childhood, too.

232
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,875
But it's a big galaxy.

233
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,083
You can't let fear get to you. Look at me.

234
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,916
We got room for luxury suites!

235
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Was not.

236
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,250
The ancient lightsaber repository.

237
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:21,375
We're looking for something very special.

238
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,666
The Saber of Scardont.

239
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,292
Said to be a Sith lightsaber
of unusual power.

240
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,333
How dare you!

241
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,458
Ooh! This must be priceless!

242
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,875
What the... Dean! Fix it!

243
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,500
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

244
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,167
That's a Sith lightsaber, kid.
I wouldn't mess with it.

245
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,542
I told you, I can't lose this job.

246
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,500
While the boy toils,

247
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,833
would any of you care to hear
the Tale of the Saber of Scardont?

248
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:02,542
Why do I have the feeling
no matter what we say, you're gonna...

249
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,750
-It is a tale of two monstrosities.
-And there it is...

250
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,708
Was that lightning... Inside?

251
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:20,208
Left for dead
by a Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi,

252
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,792
Darth Maul nonetheless survived.

253
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:30,083
And made his way to a clan
of witches known as the Nightsisters.

254
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:34,875
Now, you shall rise! Rise!

255
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,167
But of course, Mother.

256
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,125
Ow!

257
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:42,792
Uh-oh.

258
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,000
Rise!

259
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,667
Rise!

260
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,708
Ah, so close.

261
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,000
- Now... Rise!
- Rise!

262
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,458
Rise!

263
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,958
Hang on. A guy gets cut in half, lives,

264
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,333
and gets put back together
by a bunch of witches.

265
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,125
Is anybody buying this?

266
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,792
Oh, tell us more!

267
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,417
Yeah, does he take the legs off to sleep?

268
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,792
But Maul was not the only one
who returned after being left for dead.

269
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:24,833
A loyal student of Count Dooku
once known as Qymaen jai Sheelal,

270
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:29,708
but reborn as General Grievous.

271
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,292
-You clumsy fool!
-Excuse me?

272
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,375
Kidding.

273
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,708
General Grievous, we are receiving
a transmission from Lord Sidious.

274
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,042
How may I be of service, my lord?

275
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:49,875
There is an ancient Sith Saber located
on the sixth moon in the Scardont system.

276
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,458
You will find it and bring it to me.

277
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:57,292
And be warned,
the Saber of Scardont's power is so great,

278
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,667
anyone who attempts to wield it
will be driven mad.

279
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,792
I shall not fail.

280
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,667
Oh, no!

281
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,375
Really scraping
the bottom of the barrel

282
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,125
with General Wheezius there.

283
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,625
You know, back in the day,
I had Darth Maul.

284
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,083
You know, before he "came apart."

285
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:26,042
I have returned, my master.

286
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,833
No!
Hey, hey! Well, look at you.

287
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,667
You're... You're alive.

288
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,792
Oh, and look you've got legs...
A whole bunch of legs.

289
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,292
- Yes. So, many legs.
- No, no, no. Turn... Turn left.

290
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,500
-I... No!
-My left.

291
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,125
One, two, three, four, five, six.

292
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,542
I will retrieve the Saber of Scardont

293
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,125
so that I may once again
stand by your side.

294
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,250
Oh, you heard that.

295
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:00,875
Though the journey was difficult,
Grievous would not yield.

296
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:16,292
The Saber of Scardont's
power is so great,

297
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,792
anyone who attempts to wield it
will be driven mad.

298
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:28,917
Ah, a rival to bring
the saber to Lord Sidious.

299
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,458
The power.

300
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:39,208
Too bad it can't be split in half, Maul.

301
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,917
Unlike you!

302
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:47,333
At least I can wield the Force.
Force spin! Force leap!

303
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,333
I'm taking it to Sidious!

304
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,333
- It's mine! Let go!
- You let go!

305
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,667
You let go! Coochy coochy coo...

306
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,792
Cut that out!

307
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:16,458
I will destroy you!
Power is mine!

308
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,750
Force flip!

309
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:29,042
Come on, I just got these!

310
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:34,250
I've destroyed Jedi.
A half-Sith is no match for me!

311
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,833
- What?
- It appears you are un-armed!

312
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,208
And without a leg to stand on.

313
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:54,375
Hmm, perhaps you need a cough drop!

314
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,917
That's not funny!

315
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,083
Warm up the oil bath!

316
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:15,083
So, did you find it?

317
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,208
Ooh! Give me, give me, give me!

318
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,333
Uh, what's with the eyes?

319
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:29,833
The blade is mine! All...

320
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,833
Oh, you know, uh, funny thing,
it must have been damaged in the fight.

321
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:38,417
Oh, too bad. Pushity push!

322
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,667
Goodbye!

323
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,667
Ow!

324
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,542
There it is.

325
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:57,417
I can't believe he broke it.
Apprentices. Am I right?

326
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:01,417
Defeated, but not destroyed,

327
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,208
Darth Maul gained
a valuable insight into his feeling...

328
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,375
I got it.

329
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,917
Whoa...

330
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,000
So strong.

331
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,875
Uh, Dean? You okay?

332
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,458
Maybe you wanna stop staring
into the scary saber?

333
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,833
As Vaneé was saying,

334
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:25,833
Darth Maul gained a valuable insight.

335
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:30,250
Power comes
not from serving others, but...

336
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,875
From serving yourself.

337
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,875
Very good, boy.

338
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:40,292
Now, see where the saber leads you.

339
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,750
Uh, what is that?

340
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,792
Perhaps Vaneé placed his hopes
on the wrong pilot.

341
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,917
Perhaps.

342
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,958
Follow me, everyone.

343
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:13,333
I got a bad feeling...

344
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:14,833
It's still worth mentioning.

345
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,042
The first Temple of Mustafar.

346
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,792
Built generations ago.

347
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,667
A repository of ancient lore!

348
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,542
Lore schmore.

349
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:33,250
I mean,
this stuff must be worth a fortune.

350
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,792
Pack it up, boys.

351
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,125
Hey!

352
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,750
All treasure is the property
of Graballa the Hutt Enterprises, LLC.

353
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,750
Graballa, we need to talk.

354
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:51,875
Let me guess, Dameron, now,
you want the spokesman gig, right?

355
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:54,500
-Too late!
-No. This Sith stuff.

356
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,458
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is?

357
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:57,917
I'm a Hutt.

358
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
The only thing I fear is poor cash flow.

359
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:05,750
- Power.
- Here, boy.

360
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,000
- Freedom is yours.
- Save your mother.

361
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,042
- Take what you desire.
- Fear no more.

362
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,500
- This is yours.
- What do you desire?

363
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,292
Whoa!

364
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,292
Yes! The boy has found it.

365
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,500
Found what?

366
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,375
This has the power
to make any dream come true.

367
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:29,750
That little triangle
makes wishes come true.

368
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,083
Oh, please.

369
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:34,250
Nothing in the galaxy can do that.

370
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,125
A Wookiee's Paw can.

371
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:39,917
Oh, the child knows of the Wookiee's Paw?

372
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,917
The pilots who came to my mom's shop
would tell stories.

373
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,917
I've heard those stories, too.

374
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,167
-They're made-up.
-Are they?

375
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,042
Submitted for your approval.

376
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:55,042
The tale of a boy in search of more.

377
00:26:55,125 --> 00:27:00,250
Of a better life. Much like you.

378
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:14,375
Uh, the droid
on the South Ridge broke down.

379
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,667
Again. Useless.

380
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,667
Luke, I want you to go to Mos Espa
and get a new one.

381
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,917
But, Uncle Owen,

382
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,458
I was going to Tosche Station to drop off
my application for the Academy.

383
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,042
You get your head out of the stars.

384
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:29,458
Harvest is coming up
and we're short-handed. Now go.

385
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,625
I'll show him.

386
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,875
I will be a pilot one day
and get off this dust ball planet.

387
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:46,667
You look like you want
to get off this dust ball planet.

388
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,792
I got something that might help.

389
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:52,667
-What is that?
-The Wookiee's Paw.

390
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:58,167
Make a wish
and your dream instantly comes true.

391
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,833
I wish I was off this rock.

392
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:06,958
Hey! You look like
you want to get off this rock.

393
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,333
You should join the Imperial Academy.

394
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,042
Really?

395
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,958
And as he wished,

396
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:18,375
the Wookiee's Paw
took Skywalker off of Tatooine.

397
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:21,208
Yet, he still wasn't satisfied.

398
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,917
Ow!

399
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,833
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

400
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,792
I wish I was a pilot.

401
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,500
Sir, what should I do
with this extra pilot gear?

402
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,750
Give it to him.

403
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:40,625
He looks too short to be
a stormtrooper anyway.

404
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm a pilot!

405
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:45,500
Everything Skywalker wanted,
he got.

406
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:48,125
Yet, he still wanted more.

407
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,375
Patrol duty.

408
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:54,083
I wish I had the chance
to show everyone how great I can be.

409
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,917
Lord Vader's
squadron is under Rebel ambush.

410
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,625
All fighters assist.

411
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,167
It's about time.

412
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,083
Hmm?

413
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,208
Hmm?

414
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:21,375
Not so fast, Rebel scum. Eat proton.

415
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,375
You. Pilot.

416
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:36,500
That maneuver,
what do you call it?

417
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,958
The 180 Reverse Proton Move.

418
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:41,875
Most impressive.
What's your name?

419
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,625
Luke Skywalker, sir.

420
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,250
Skywalker?

421
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,792
I knew a Skywalker once.

422
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:53,625
- Um, Lord Vader?
- Huh? Oh, yeah. Right.

423
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,667
You are sensitive with the Force.

424
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,833
You remind me of... A young me.

425
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,583
I will train you.

426
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:05,708
Whoa! I only wish I could be
as powerful as you.

427
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:07,583
Then come with me.

428
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:14,333
Actually, I wish to be
more powerful than you.

429
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,083
Your eyes can deceive you.

430
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,583
Don't trust them.

431
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,000
I can still see.

432
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,458
Firm touch.

433
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,333
Focus. Focus.

434
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,333
It tickles.

435
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,833
More like this.

436
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,958
Try again.

437
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,625
For luck.

438
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,917
You have mastered
the dark side of the Force.

439
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,292
Yet, I sense you are still unsatisfied.

440
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,167
I want more.

441
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,917
I wish I could fight the rebellion

442
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,708
and become the most famous pilot
in the galaxy!

443
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,167
The Death Star is under attack!
Vader, scramble your men.

444
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:39,375
- All wings report in.
- Red Two standing by.

445
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,417
Red Ten standing by, Princess Leia.

446
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,250
Red Five standing by.

447
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:47,042
Good to have you, General Kenobi.
And thank you for rescuing me earlier.

448
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:51,250
No, thank you for rescuing me
from that trash compactor, Your Highness.

449
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:54,083
I wasn't sure I'd make it
off the Death Star alive.

450
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,542
Lock S-foils in attack position.

451
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,667
I'm making my run. Cover me!

452
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,500
Enemy fighters coming our way.

453
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:13,125
Like Beggar's Canyon back home!

454
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm hit! I can't stay with you!

455
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,875
Get clear, Obi-Wan.
You can't do any more good back there.

456
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,250
- I'm on the leader!
- No, I am!

457
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,292
Oh, no! He's trying the...

458
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:33,667
One-eighty Reverse Proton maneuver!
Oh, yeah!

459
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,458
I don't think so, fly boy!

460
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

461
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:46,208
-Oh!
-No!

462
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:51,417
You're going to be
the most famous pilot in the galaxy.

463
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,542
Yes!

464
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,333
For blowing up the Death Star!

465
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,417
No.

466
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,208
Is that really what happened?

467
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,292
No, it's not.

468
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,958
You're saying Luke Skywalker
did not blow up the Death Star?

469
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,167
Well, yeah, but not like that.

470
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:11,542
Just as the Wookiee's Paw
gave Skywalker all that he wanted,

471
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:16,000
this holocron will grant
whatever you desire.

472
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:20,083
No! That story is a warning.
Be careful what you wish for!

473
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,708
I know what you want.

474
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,958
For your family to be safe.

475
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:28,792
Open this and never fear for them again.

476
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,000
No, don't do it!

477
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:40,875
Not with your hands. With your heart.

478
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,417
You said this makes dreams come true!

479
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,208
It does make dreams come true.

480
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,750
Mine!

481
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:07,083
Long has Vaneé waited for this.

482
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:10,500
I thought you were the one
to make it happen.

483
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:14,958
But little did I know,
it was the boy I needed.

484
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,375
One who is strong with the Force.

485
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,542
I'm strong with the Force?

486
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:27,542
Oh, my whole life I was weak.

487
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:31,417
Pitiful. Afraid to seize power.

488
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,875
Like in the Mask of Ren story.

489
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,625
Always toiling for others.

490
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,167
Like Darth Maul.

491
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,958
Now Vaneé has all he desires.

492
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,833
Like the Wookiee's Paw!

493
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,833
Those stories were for him!

494
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,208
Okay, really, like you had it figured out?

495
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:56,542
For a generation,
the galaxy feared my master!

496
00:34:56,625 --> 00:35:00,958
Now it shall fear... Me.

497
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:02,833
Yeah, you and what army?

498
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:07,208
Yeah, some army. One droid.

499
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,333
Roger, roger. Roger. Roger.

500
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:20,458
These fools have served
their purpose.

501
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:23,583
NI-L8, annihilate them.

502
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:24,875
As you command.

503
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,500
- Oh!
- Destroy...

504
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:31,583
NI-L8, "annihilate."
Should have put that together sooner.

505
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:35,250
Swarming killer droids
and you focus on the wordplay? Run!

506
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,250
We gotta grab that holocron!
It's the source of his power.

507
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,833
-How?
-We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

508
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,292
Whoa! Nice shot!

509
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,000
Grab it, kid!

510
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,542
Master, are you all right?

511
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:55,625
Without the holocron,
my power will not hold! Get them!

512
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,167
Destroy...

513
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:58,958
In here.

514
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,875
Whew!

515
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:15,917
Roger, roger, roger, roger, roger.

516
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:20,333
I think I lost 'em.

517
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:24,083
Mama! That's a big one.

518
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,333
My dreams are crumbling around me.

519
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:33,667
Here's B-14961138815...

520
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,500
- Took you long enough!
- Here's...

521
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:49,667
Destroy, roger. Destroy, roger.

522
00:36:55,458 --> 00:37:01,792
Destroy. Destroy.
Destroy. Destroy...

523
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:05,208
Destroy. Destroy...

524
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:12,375
Vaneé's right behind us.

525
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:17,000
-What do we do now?
-I have an idea.

526
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,292
Where is my holocron?

527
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:31,458
I find
your lack of souvenirs disturbing...

528
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,833
Disturbing. Disturbing...

529
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:35,375
Destroy.

530
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,875
We gotta get to the ship

531
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,625
and get that holocron
as far away from Vaneé as possible.

532
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,125
This way!

533
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,708
-It's all my fault.
-Kid.

534
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,917
I fixed that lightsaber.

535
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,250
I opened the holocron.
All because I was scared.

536
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,250
Everyone gets scared, kid.

537
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,333
You don't.

538
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:57,708
Well, no, but, you know,
sometimes the adrenaline gets going...

539
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,833
I'm scared right now.

540
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,250
You can't control fear.

541
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,500
But you can choose what to do with it.

542
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:12,708
Because without fear,
you can't have courage.

543
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:19,333
Destroy. Destroy. Destroy.

544
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:20,792
BB-8! What are you doing?

545
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,167
Now let's get outta here.

546
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,000
Oh, we never fixed it!

547
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:49,292
Way to go, Dameron!
Always having to prove how brave you are!

548
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,542
-Poe...
-Pulling that move in the X-wing!

549
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,792
-Poe?
-Opening that stupid door.

550
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:54,917
Poe!

551
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,208
I got this.

552
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,417
May the Force be with you.

553
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,667
-I'll buy us time.
-How?

554
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,750
I have no idea!

555
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:15,792
Destroy. Roger. Destroy.
Roger. Destroy. Roger. Destroy...

556
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:21,750
The energy of the dark side
is slipping away.

557
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,458
Where is the holocron?

558
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:27,708
Ah!

559
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:29,792
Blast! Missed!

560
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:33,333
Roger. Roger. Roger.

561
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:36,000
Ro-Ro-Roger.

562
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,833
They're wrecking my place! We gotta fight!

563
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,833
Hide me!

564
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,958
I could get used to this.

565
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:56,167
Yes, destroy him!

566
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,625
Come on, come on.
Got you right where I want you.

567
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:27,417
Destroy. Destroy.
Destroy. Destroy. Destroy...

568
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,792
Yeah! This is so fu...

569
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,042
Whoa!

570
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,417
Dean!

571
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:41,958
My holocron.

572
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,583
I got this.

573
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,208
Nice flyin', kid.

574
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:56,333
Master is gone!
The Emperor is gone!

575
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:59,500
Finally, the galaxy shall fear me!

576
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm not scared.

577
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,917
Okay, maybe a little.

578
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,167
Hey!

579
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:11,750
Give me the holocron
and I will spare your friend's life.

580
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:15,625
No! Fly away! He's getting weaker!

581
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,625
Soon he'll be nothing. Whoa!

582
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,542
You don't have that kind of time.

583
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,500
The choice is yours, boy.

584
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,167
Whoa!

585
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,417
All right!

586
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:44,792
Although, this reminds me
of the story of the Wookie's Paw.

587
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,167
And how is that?

588
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,083
Careful what you wish for!

589
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,208
No!

590
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,458
No!

591
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:04,792
Ow.

592
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,000
Cut it a little close there,
don't you think?

593
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,458
Still, it was a gutsy move. How'd you...

594
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:15,458
Like you said,
without fear you can't have courage.

595
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:19,750
-Thank you, Poe.
-Oh! Don't get all mushy on me, kid.

596
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:24,458
Aw! Is the brave Poe Dameron
afraid of a little mushiness?

597
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,708
Terrified.

598
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,917
Oh!

599
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,167
My hotel. My beautiful hotel.

600
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:38,292
Ah! You! Look what you did!

601
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,458
You have any idea
what this'll cost for me to fix?

602
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:45,750
You're not fixing anything.
You're leaving.

603
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:48,667
And don't even think
about taking those Sith artifacts.

604
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,958
I'm not scared of you, Dameron.

605
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:57,125
Okay, fine, I am. Let's go, boys.
That means you, too, kid. Come on.

606
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,750
-No.
-No?

607
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,375
I'll never work for you again.

608
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,667
See? That's what greed gets you, Graballa.

609
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,917
Nothing.

610
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,042
Yeah, you're right.
I really learned my lesson.

611
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,458
Gotta start small!
Like a bed and breakfast!

612
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:13,792
Come on, boys! We're gonna be rich.

613
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,417
-Ooh, breakfast!
-Breakfast!

614
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:19,583
I just realized. My wish came true.

615
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:22,667
What? You actually wished
on that Sith holocron?

616
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,917
Of course not.

617
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,708
But I have been wishing to quit

618
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:28,940
pretty much from the day
I started working for Graballa.

619
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:32,833
Well, then I guess you're out of a job.
What're you going to do now?

620
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:34,250
I don't know.

621
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:37,792
I saw how you handled that X-wing.
We always need pilots.

622
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:39,792
Really? Thank you, Poe.

623
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,958
And you should meet my friend, Rey.

624
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:44,208
She knows a little about the Force.

625
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,208
So you were scared back there?

626
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,958
Nah, I just said that
to make you feel better.

627
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:53,250
I wasn't scared.

628
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:55,417
Was not!

629
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,167
Master, forgive me.
I have failed you!
