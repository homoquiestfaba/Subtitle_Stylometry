1
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,845
Isn't it funny how a few short days
can change your whole life.

2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:19,894
And sometimes, its not until later, much later,
that you realize what happened to you,

3
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:28,319
and when it happened, and why it happened.
Life sure is strange... sometimes.

4
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,037
Hop in.

5
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,048
Let's hit it man.

6
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,344
I'm Harmer and this is Stokes.

7
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,804
I'm Harmer and this is Stokes.

8
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,389
Hey, how's it goin'?

9
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,307
I'm Allen.

10
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,683
Ya feel that earthquake?

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,559
When?

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,478
I don't know, just like ten minutes
ago.

13
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,438
I didn't feel it.

14
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,023
Well, there will be another one.

15
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,525
Where you from?

16
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,277
From Kansas.

17
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,820
Kansas? Woah.

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,988
Kansas?

19
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,200
Yeah, right near Kansas City.

20
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,746
Well, you're not in Kansas anymore
Elder.

21
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:15,927
Welcome to Los Angeles, Elder, the
greatest mission in the world.

22
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,675
I got a letter here from your bishop
about your father.

23
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,012
He's going to be in prison for a very
long time.

24
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,391
My stepfather.... he's my stepfather.

25
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,936
Says here that you are sealed to
him, that makes him your father.

26
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,522
How's your mom doin'?

27
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,279
She asked to have her name removed from the records of the church.

28
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:21,451
I suppose you are wondering what you are doing out here
on a mission while your family is falling apart back home.

29
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,453
Your dad served a mission.

30
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,954
A lot of good it did him.

31
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,917
You're not here to do good for yourself.
You've been doing that for nineteen years.

32
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:34,505
You come here to do good for other people.
Help them turn their lives around.

33
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:40,887
Your parents made some decisions that were bad decisions.
There's nothing you can do about that.

34
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,305
No.

35
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:47,143
Your job is to help some people make right decisions,
to turn their lives around. To do some good in this world.

36
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,771
Do you think you can get out and
do that?

37
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,940
I don't know.

38
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,318
Well, why don't we go out and find
out?

39
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:03,076
He's such a sweet boy. I know,
I know he's a sweet boy but he's driving me crazy.

40
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,913
I'm going to put you with one of my
best men.

41
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,082
...flipped back his coat, he's looking
up at the guy, and he's smiling..

42
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:14,379
He's 29 years old.
He's one of the oldest ones we ha ve.

43
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,215
His name's Dalton but mostly they
just call him Pops.

44
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,802
Dalton!
Yes Sir!

45
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,221
I think your husband caught us
flirting.

46
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,223
Oh, no!

47
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:31,354
Elder Dalton, this is Elder Allen,
your new companion. He's from Kansas.

48
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,485
So... you're the one.

49
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,531
Alright, let's do some good.

50
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,455
Is this our place?

51
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,289
No.

52
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,291
Well who lives here?

53
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,293
We're about to find out.

54
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,337
Why can't we just go home first?

55
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,339
We are going home...

56
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,301
...one door at a time...

57
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,932
Hi I'm Elder Dalton, this is my companion Elder Allen.
We're missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ...

58
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,392
Listen, I'm a little busy.

59
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,894
Well, we just have a short message
we'd like to share with you today.

60
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,646
Look, I don't have time right now.

61
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,898
What would be a more convenient
time for us to come back?

62
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:20,862
Look, I don't want to be rude but I'm just
not interested in what you have to say.

63
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,283
Well, I think if you aren't interested in what we have to say,
you must not know what it is that we have to say.

64
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:29,954
I'd like to leave you with this pamplet that talks a
little bit about Jesus and his visit to the Americas.

65
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,874
Do you know that Christ came to
the Americas after his resurrection?

66
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,750
No.

67
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:38,504
Well, he did.
And I think you'll be very interested in what he had to say.

68
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,841
I gotta go.

69
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,721
If you have any questions, give us a call,
the number is on the pamphlet. Thanks.

70
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,932
I could ne ver do that.

71
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,436
Yes you could. Right now in fact.
You got the next one.

72
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,286
You don't knock on people's doors
like that!

73
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,877
At that rate,
we'll be home before you know it.

74
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,473
Ok, why are we here?

75
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,476
To gain physical bodies, experience
and wisdom.

76
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,479
No, not everybody, just us, just
missionaries.

77
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,815
To baptize.
No.

78
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,484
To preach the gospel.
Wrong. Wrong?

79
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:46,948
Wrong. It's to preach the gospel by the spirit. Ok?
It can't just be you and me, it's gotta be me, you, and the Holy Spirit.

80
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,116
Right.
Right.

81
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,993
Yeah, good afternoon sisters.

82
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,703
Hey, you lonely today elder?

83
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,789
I'm lonely everyday. Did you read
that book I gave you?

84
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,082
Oh, we've been too busy.

85
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,961
Well read that book. Then you'll stop and talk?
Just read the book....

86
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,799
Okay, its not about us. Its not about how smart we
are or how fast we can flip through the scriptures.

87
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,467
Who were those girls back there?

88
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,303
How many people are you going to con vert?
What? In my whole mission?

89
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:15,143
Over the next two years, how many people are you going to convert?
I don't know. Like 30, yeah like 30.

90
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:19,564
Wrong. You're not going to convert any.
You're not going to convert a single soul. Because it's not about you.

91
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,066
It's not about me. It's between them
and the Lord.

92
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,862
We give them some tools, some information.
We're like the telephone company.

93
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,782
The Lord's on one end. We hook up
the line, but it's their conversation.

94
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:35,913
The Lord converts them. They convert themselves.
All we do is teach... by the spirit.

95
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:42,086
The field is white Elder, ready to
harvest. Even in Los Angeles.

96
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,673
That was kind of a trick question.
Yeah.

97
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,927
So where are we going? And who
were those girls back there?

98
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,767
Your turn.

99
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,936
I did the last one.
You need the practice.

100
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,857
Yeah?

101
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,735
Hi, I'm Elder Allen and this is my
companion Elder...

102
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,653
Dalton.

103
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,406
...Dalton, and we're missionaries
from the Church of Jesus Christ...

104
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,824
Not again.

105
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,951
We have a short message..

106
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:19,624
How many times do I have to tell you guys? If you come knockin' on my
door again, I'm gonna step out there and I'm gonna beat you to death.

107
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:25,963
Hey buddy, take it easy. We're just trying to share something with you.
If your'e not interested that's fine but there's no reason to be rude.

108
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,506
Rude?
Yeah.

109
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:33,804
I'm rude? I'm not the one knocking on your door all day.
I'm not even going to listen to this.

110
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,390
He y!
Hey, get your foot out of my door!

111
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,185
I'll get my foot out when you
apologize to my companion.

112
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,062
Yeah, I'm not apologizing to
anybody!

113
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,316
You're going to apologize,
and then you're going to sit down and listen to what we have to say.

114
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,401
Yeah, I'm going to get my gun!

115
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,821
Open this door... get in there and
teach him a lesson!

116
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,292
That gets the award, that gets the
award.

117
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,380
I'd like to thank the academy and all
those who voted for me.

118
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:15,721
It was pretty good man. I'm going to
laugh myself to sleep tonight.

119
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:23,479
Yo, this dude that took your picture,
for which you will always be remembered...

120
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,315
...his name is Magnum.
Hi.

121
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,567
Hey, hey. I want a copy of the
picture.

122
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:36,617
Yeah, before the second coming man. Yeah, right. Not happening.
Come on. And this worthless bum right here is Sandavol.

123
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,328
How's it goin' man. That was great
man. It really was!

124
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,666
Sandy was just pla ying the blues because his
girlfriend is going to marry his big brother.

125
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,543
She's my fianc'e.

126
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:53,801
She's your sister-in-law. I'm Banks,
and that funny looking spud over there, that's my companion, Kinegar.

127
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,263
This immature beha vior has got to
stop.

128
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:02,018
Come on man, I'll show you your room.
This isn't funny guys, it's not funny.

129
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,979
Did you see his face?

130
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,706
Who was were before?

131
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:28,252
Lambert. He left to Culver City
about five hours ago.

132
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,463
Five hours. Wow.

133
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:34,091
That's one of the blessings of the life of poverty.
Doesn't take long to pack.

134
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,219
Yeah.

135
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:44,644
Hey, tell me. What do you think of
Pops?

136
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,649
Um, I don't know.

137
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:59,075
He means well. I think he tries a little too hard.
Ya know? I guess you don't do ya? Yeah.

138
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:06,082
Well, anyway, welcome. And I'll
watch out for you, ok?

139
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:25,142
Singing

140
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,439
Dear heavenly father, thank you for
a good day's work.

141
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,819
Thank you for sending Elder Allen and forgive
us for the manner in which we welcomed him.

142
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,531
Please bless us as we go along and
just help us through our days.

143
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,493
In the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.

144
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,288
Alright, goodnight!

145
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,502
Don't touch me.

146
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,296
Thanks.

147
00:11:55,047 --> 00:12:05,141
We give thee thanks for our Savior and through Him
we may be forgiven of our sins and our weaknesses.
That we may serve thee in worthiness we pray.

148
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,519
In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

149
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,895
Amen.

150
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,859
It's good to have you.

151
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,415
We're not finished?

152
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,086
It's a personal prayer.

153
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,645
It's 10:30 Elder, lights out.

154
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,672
Pops, hey Pops wake up.

155
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,383
What time is it?

156
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,220
Its two o'clock. Get up. Your greenie
just went AWOL.

157
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,243
What time does the bus leave?

158
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,995
6:30.

159
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,458
That's quite a wait.

160
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,086
You don't have to stay.

161
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:04,051
No, yes I do. See, I'm your companion.
At least until you get on that bus.

162
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,889
So what? You're going to try and
talk me out of it now?

163
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,976
No, you're a big boy. You can make
your own decisions.

164
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,651
It's bad timing. That's all. I might
come back later.

165
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:26,574
No... they won't let you. You throw it
away and it's gone.

166
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,242
They'll let me come back.

167
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:33,122
Well, yeah.
When you are 65 and you've got arthritis and kidney stones,

168
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,001
maybe they'll let you help people
with their family history...

169
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,961
Boy, wouldn't that be fun?

170
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,381
I just didn't think I should be here.

171
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:51,265
Well then you shouldn't. Three hours from now you won't be. Good for
you. And good for me. I don't need anymore deadbeat companions.

172
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,684
I'm not a deadbeat.

173
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,687
Then you must be a coward.

174
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,735
Ya know, you don't know anything
about me.

175
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,616
Alright, fine. Why are you leaving?

176
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,203
What, I've known you for half a day and
you expect me to bare my soul to you?

177
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,165
At least no one can say I didn't try.

178
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,503
Yeah. You gave it a whole 12 hours.

179
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,386
He y!

180
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,804
He y!

181
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,474
You got a girlfriend?

182
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,393
You miss her I bet.

183
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,395
It's not a girl, I don't even have a
girlfriend.

184
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,106
He doesn't want to talk about it.

185
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:46,987
Ok! So what are we going to do
here for the ne xt three hours?

186
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,243
Maybe its a word of wisdom
problem.

187
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,330
Maybe he likes to take a drink now
and then.

188
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,667
Maybe...

189
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:08,592
Or maybe its a morality problem.
Maybe he's in love with you.

190
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:12,513
Fine, I'll go back! Just leave me
alone!

191
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,556
Ok, good decision.

192
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,184
What?

193
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,063
I told you, I don't want any
deadbeat companions.

194
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,065
I can sta y if I want.

195
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,528
You do it my way. You do the work,
you keep all the rules.

196
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,779
Fine.

197
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,614
Fine.

198
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,077
But I'm keeping my ticket.

199
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,664
Good idea.
And, I'm not unpacking my bags.

200
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,832
Fine.

201
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,250
Alright then.

202
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,459
Alright.

203
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,564
That hurt?

204
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,732
Yeah.

205
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,017
What?

206
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,269
It's nothing.

207
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,606
The Book of Mormon talks about
horses in America.

208
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,149
What?

209
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:52,321
There were no horses in America before Columbus.
It's pretty much a documented fact.

210
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,408
Why you still reading that stuff? It's
as bad as pornography.

211
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,994
How do you expect to defend
yourself against these people?

212
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,497
Man, these people are the enemy.
You want to look stupid in front of them?

213
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,665
You gotta know their weapons and
their strategy!

214
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,626
You know, you got some weird
terminology there.

215
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,629
You ought to be reading the
scriptures, not this garbage.

216
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,257
Whatever you say.

217
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,243
Hey did I ever tell you what the snail said
when he was riding the turtle's back?

218
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,994
What?

219
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,955
Weeeeee!

220
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,708
Ha ha

221
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,922
How many of those are you going
to do anyway?

222
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,173
160...

223
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,676
Hey Pops, why don't you get down
there and do a few?

224
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,470
I could be dead in six months, what
do I want to exercise for?

225
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,182
Because it's fun Pops. Don't it look
like fun?

226
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,726
What do you call three lepers in a
hot tub?

227
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,229
A stew.

228
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,775
OK. Why did the lepers have to
stop the poker game?

229
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,111
Cause they threw their hands on
the table.

230
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,698
Ok. This will do it.

231
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,409
Why did the lepers have to stop
their hocke y game?

232
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,997
There was a face off on the ice.

233
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,798
Yeah, that's pretty good

234
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,948
It's 7:30. Personal study.

235
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,159
Right...

236
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,672
What am I supposed to be
studying?

237
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,928
Well then, that would be personal.

238
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:39,196
Hey wake up! It's 8:30, companion
study.

239
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:47,245
Why don't you turn to the book of
First TImothy? Chapter 1.

240
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,585
First TImothy. It's in the Bible?

241
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,383
Page 1506... second column.

242
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:09,101
In the New Testament. Top of the
page.

243
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:15,899
Ok. "But we know that the law is
good if a man use it lawfully.

244
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:20,153
Knowing this that a law is not made
for a righteous man...

245
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,557
Alright. Let's do some good!

246
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,492
Hi. I'm Elder Allen and this is my
companion Elder Dalton.

247
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:51,304
Look, I'm very busy right now.
Why don't you just go and talk to somebody else?

248
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,689
Ahh, there's no nobody home.

249
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:21,459
Hi, I got to go to the bathroom. I've
got to go to the bathroom

250
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,720
Hey Pops.
Hey.

251
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,432
Man that looks good.

252
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,603
Hey guys.
Hey Connie.

253
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,356
You must be the new one.
Hi.

254
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:30,320
Yes this youngster here is my new companion.
Hi, I'm Connie. I'm Brandon.

255
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,198
I mean, I'm Elder Allen.

256
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:38,954
Connie I would like one of those great big greasy double cheese burgers

257
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,791
With a couple of onion rings.
On the side this time?

258
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,293
No, no, no, no, no in the burger.

259
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:49,548
No lettuce, no pickle,
some of those french fries around the side like you do.

260
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,134
And one of those great big
chocolate shakes with extra syrup.

261
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:57,639
Anything for you Brandon?
No. I'm fine.

262
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:02,269
Will you close your mouth when
you're eating? It's disgusting.

263
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,108
Man, is she really pretty or have I
just been out too long?

264
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,943
You've definately been out too long.

265
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,653
I think she's pretty.

266
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:18,076
Yeah well, you know what they say, if you don't look once
you're not a man, but if you look twice you're not a missionary.

267
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,037
How many times you guys look?

268
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,456
I looked once. What about you?

269
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,043
I'm still looking once.

270
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,131
Here you go.

271
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,466
Gracias. Thank you.

272
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,927
And here's your check.

273
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,764
Hey, uh, Connie...
Yeah?

274
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,809
You know we're missionaries, right?

275
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,645
Sure. I know. You guys come in
here all the time.

276
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,772
So, you know what we do, right?

277
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,651
Yeah, you're kinda like nuns, but
you're men?

278
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:56,114
Yeah, kind of. But you know we only
do this for two years

279
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,617
and then, you know,
we go home and go to work or go back to school...

280
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,287
Or get married.
Sure, sure. We could do that.

281
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,832
You know, I mean I could do that.
You know, with someone.

282
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,711
Okay.
Can I ask you a question?

283
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,964
If I gave you a book, would you
read it?

284
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,091
You don't have money for a tip, do
you?

285
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:20,388
No, we'll leave you a tip and the
Book of Mormon. If you'll read it.

286
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,808
I like to read.

287
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,320
Thank you.

288
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,489
You're welcome.

289
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,119
I sure do lo ve missionary work.

290
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,456
I'm not quite clear on this. Was that
called finding or flirting?

291
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:50,752
I wasn't flirting. I was being flirted.

292
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,340
Yeah, that's right. I wasn't dancing
president. I was being danced.

293
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,967
I wasn't kissing president.
I was being kissed. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,304
Are you going to eat that?
Yeah.

295
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:08,186
Hey, did you guys know that Joseph Smith
gave four different accounts of the first vision?

296
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,774
Did you?

297
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,152
Why don't you put that stuff away man?
That's really starting to get on my nerves.

298
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:20,115
Alright.
I just thought you might want to learn about your own religion.

299
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:27,080
He gave different accounts because he was talking
to different audiences in different circumstances.

300
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:33,461
That must be why the first presidency never e ven mentioned
that God and Jesus Christ appeared until after the 1900s.

301
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,214
It's not true.
It says it right here.

302
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:40,718
Look its not true.
Orson Pratt and John Taylor both taught it, repeatedly.

303
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:45,223
Why don't you look it up? In our
books for a change.

304
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,685
How many lies do you have to find in there before you're going to get it?

305
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,896
Just forget it okay?
No I'm not going to forget it.

306
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,731
Look at this stuff.

307
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,817
Who are these people?

308
00:28:56,317 --> 00:29:00,613
Don' they have anything better to do with their time?
I mean we've got drugs, disease, people living out on the street

309
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,825
and these people spend their time
trying to tear down other people's faith.

310
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,578
Doesn't that give you a clue?

311
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,748
Why are you getting so upset
elder?

312
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:16,045
I'm getting upset because you're wasting your
time with that garbage instead of doing your work.

313
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,881
And why aren't you with your
companion?

314
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,550
Because he's sick of listening to this
stuff.

315
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,012
You're dragging him down and you're dragging the rest of us down too.

316
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,347
So why don't you get it together?

317
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,308
Excuse me...

318
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,144
...I have to use the restroom.

319
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,356
I better go.

320
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,452
I'm Catholic and your mother was
Catholic.

321
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,245
I know Papa.

322
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,208
And your grandparents and your
great grandparents were Catholic.

323
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:58,755
We know that Papa. You've been good to us.
You and Mama always took us to mass.

324
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,131
You're mother was devout.

325
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,009
But these missionaries, they have
the Lord's spirit.

326
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,096
Laura felt it. She felt it at my
baptism.

327
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:13,019
I feel it every week at church and when I
pray and when I read the scriptures Papa.

328
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,356
Do you feel the spirit when these
boys come to visit?

329
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:21,236
I do. Do you feel it now?
I do Papa.

330
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,487
I feel nothing.

331
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,073
We have a baptism scheduled for
Saturday.

332
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:31,496
Laura still lives at home. She needs
your blessing, your consent.

333
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:37,085
Laura has already been baptised.
We're Catholic.

334
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,379
We're Catholic.

335
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,846
Hello there sisters. You're out early
today.

336
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,640
We're the early birds. We get all the
worms you know.

337
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,058
Did you read that book I gave you?
No.

338
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,601
I read it.

339
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,439
You read the book?

340
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,400
I read the book.

341
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,236
You read the Book of Mormon?

342
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,447
Yeah. What, you don't think I can
read or something?

343
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,491
No, it's just...

344
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,536
What was your fa vorite part?

345
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,294
I like the part where that prophet...

346
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,463
Abi-nadi?

347
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,007
Abinadi, yeah.

348
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,468
Yeah! Where he tells the king and
all the people to repent and all

349
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,972
and they won't do it. And so they tell
him to deny Jesus

350
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:37,895
and he won't do that and so they tie him up and the y put sticks
under him and they set him on fire and they burn him to death.

351
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,983
It was kind of sad.

352
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,320
But I like that part a lot.

353
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,698
So can I have that appointment
now?

354
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,952
How about Saturday night?

355
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,537
We're working Saturday night.

356
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,999
Yeah.
Ok, how about Saturday day?

357
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,335
Yeah, we can do that.
Alright.

358
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,463
Can I do that?
Yeah, we can do that.

359
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,601
So what is your dad like?

360
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,228
What?

361
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:24,859
I mean, we're companions. I'm
supposed to get to know you, right?

362
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,239
My dad's a really great guy.

363
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,412
Not much of a sense of humor
though.

364
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,915
What does he do?

365
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,293
He's a janitor actually.

366
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,632
Yeah, he works at my old high
school.

367
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:52,804
He was always hoping that I'd be a surgeon in the military.
You know, become an officer.

368
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,223
So, he didn't want you to go on a
mission?

369
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,933
No, he's not Mormon.

370
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,643
Oh.

371
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,187
Not yet.

372
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,402
When he found out that we don't get paid for this,
for being missionaries,

373
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:14,075
you should have seen him. He
didn't understand that at all.

374
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,621
How about your mom?

375
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:24,419
My mom died a long time ago. She
had cancer.

376
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,506
What about your mom?

377
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,925
She's still alive and all.

378
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,720
Well, that's a good thing.

379
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:43,187
Yeah. My dad... left when I was
seven.

380
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,898
I haven't seen him since.

381
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,612
I don't remember much about him.

382
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:55,616
Just that he took me to this baseball
game once.

383
00:33:55,616 --> 00:34:00,538
And the last time I saw him... he
gave me this autographed baseball.

384
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,832
...Hank Aaron.

385
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,376
Really?
Yeah...

386
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,795
Wow!
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

387
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:12,675
But then when I was thirteen...
and I saw Hank's real signature on a baseball...

388
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,511
...didn't look anything like mine.

389
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,930
No wa y!

390
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:22,393
That's the kind of guy he was, huh?

391
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,566
Hey, Dalton!

392
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:38,201
Brother Rose! This tadpole here's my new companion,
his name's Elder Allen. He's from Kansas.

393
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,285
Kansas?

394
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,412
Yeah, right near Kansas City.

395
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,498
Well Elder, you're not in Kansas any
more.

396
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,291
Yep, heard that one already.

397
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,214
Brother Rose, are you in our ward?

398
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,008
Brother Rose isn't baptised yet.

399
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,803
Why is that I keep forgeting...

400
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,598
Brother Rose can't give up his
coffee.

401
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,892
I'm trying.

402
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:07,480
We got a deal going. For every cup of coffee he drinks,
we get a free ride somewhere.

403
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,856
What are we up to now?

404
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,360
67.

405
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,447
You know there's only one way to
pay that off...

406
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,157
clean the slate.

407
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:18,866
I know.

408
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,620
Benny's getting baptised on Saturday.
Feel like going for a swim?

409
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,925
Elders, Brother Rose, hi!

410
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,843
Hey, Benny.

411
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,969
How ya doing?

412
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,139
Great. Benny, I would like you to
meet my brand new companion.

413
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,475
Elder Allen.

414
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,143
Elder Allen, hi.
Hi.

415
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,437
Where're you from?
Kansas.

416
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,814
Where?

417
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,484
Back east, mid-west.
You know, Toto, Dorothy, yellow brick road.

418
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,444
Yeah, I love that movie

419
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,990
Come on out back, Brother Rose.

420
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,075
How are ya?
I'm doing well. How are you?

421
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,660
Good to see you.

422
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,953
Hi elders.

423
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,330
Oh, my gosh, what is this?

424
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,791
Oh Elaine, you didn't have to do
that.

425
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,167
Oh, yes she did.

426
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,044
I see you finally made it.

427
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,421
I am right on time.

428
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,673
If you're not ten minutes early,
you're late.

429
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,425
Yeah, who told you that?

430
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,384
You did.

431
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,512
So is this the greenie?

432
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,763
I'm Elder Allen.

433
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,849
Hi Elder Allen, I'm Sister Monson.

434
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,976
Hi. Nice to meet you.
You too.

435
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,728
This is Benny's sister Elaine.

436
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,395
Hi.
Hi.

437
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:33,524
Benny, do you want to eat first or
shall we have an interview?

438
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,694
Honestly, I think I'd rather eat first. If
that's alright.

439
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,239
Give you time to relax.
That's right.

440
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,535
Benny, who would you like to say
the blessing?

441
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,164
Brother Rose, will you say it?
Okay.

442
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,881
Our Father in Heaven, we thank
you for this food...

443
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,301
Okay, Benny...

444
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:08,184
the reason l'm here today is to talk with
you a little bit about your baptism.

445
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,896
Yes, it's on Saturday.
Yeah.

446
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:18,319
And to be sure that you understand the
covenants that you'll be making with the Lord.

447
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,782
And also to be sure that you are ready
and worth y to make those covenants.

448
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,743
So I need to ask you a few
questions.

449
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:30,539
And whatever we talk about is just
between you and me.

450
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,042
Do you understand?

451
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,378
Yes.

452
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,214
Alright.

453
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,561
What do you play?

454
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,107
I played a little baseball...

455
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,236
No, I meant musical instrument.
Piano? Guitar?

456
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:06,450
No. Not really. Do you... play
anything?

457
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,327
Cello.

458
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,872
It's shaped like a really big violin.

459
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,376
I know what a cello is.

460
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,381
My brothers were all jocks.
I'm not a jock.

461
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,635
They could bench press 300 pounds,
but they wouldn't read a book to sa ve their lives.

462
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,762
I like to read.

463
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,347
Oh really?

464
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,016
Yeah, I do.

465
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,185
Alright then...

466
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,855
in a jock's opinion of course,

467
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:40,067
what would you sa y are the three
greatest books ever written?

468
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,528
Wow, there's so many...

469
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,780
why don't you go first?

470
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,368
Alright that's easy.
First would be "Grapes of Wrath" by John Steinbeck.

471
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:55,666
Second would be Tolstoy's "War and Peace" or "Ana Corinnina".
You take your pick.

472
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,919
And then maybe Chaim Potok's "My
Name is Asher Lev".

473
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,005
Have you ever read any of those?

474
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,966
I think I read one of Steinbeck's
back in high school.

475
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,970
It was about the dumb guy and he
strangles the rabbits, you know?

476
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,430
"Of Mice and Men"?

477
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,557
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a short one.

478
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,476
Okay, your turn.

479
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,603
Wait, let me guess.

480
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,857
Volumes one through three of the
Goosebumps series.

481
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:25,613
Actually um, hmmm, I think my
choices would be...

482
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:31,744
...the Bible, the Book of Mormon
and the Doctrine and Convenants.

483
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,081
Yeah, those would definately be my
picks.

484
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,250
You set yourself up for that one.

485
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,135
So, you think I'm ready?

486
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,304
I think you are.

487
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,561
Elder?

488
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,607
Do you think...

489
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,612
...could someone like me teach the
gospel?

490
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,865
...be a missionary I mean?

491
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:16,413
Absolutely. You just take a year or
so to prepare and study and then...

492
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:21,877
if you're worthy and able, you could
be a missionary, yeah.

493
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:25,297
I can run faster than you can in
these.

494
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,550
I know you can. I know it.

495
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,471
But I'm 24 years old.

496
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:42,690
Benny... when I was baptised I was
25.

497
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,401
I was in my second year of medical
school.

498
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,780
You could have been a doctor by
now.

499
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:57,663
This is the best thing I've ever done.
It's the best thing I'll ever do.

500
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,045
So, what do you think of the
sisters?

501
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,883
I think Monson's nice. I don't know
about that other one though.

502
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,593
Yeah. Sister Fronk.

503
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,969
Yeah, what a...

504
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,346
What?

505
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,932
She's a very smart girl.

506
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,351
She thinks so.

507
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,981
Well, she is pretty, don't you think?

508
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,858
No, I didn't notice that.

509
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,777
Maybe if she'd smile once in a
while.

510
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:32,239
She had on a nice dress though...

511
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,409
don't you think?

512
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,622
You know, I didn't notice.

513
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:03,145
Kinegar! Elder Kinegar! Kinegar!

514
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,901
Hold him down!

515
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,488
C'mon, his tongue, hold it down!

516
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,365
Not with your fingers. He'll bite your
fingers off

517
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:19,119
Oh great, here we go again. Call
9-1 -1 now!

518
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,246
We need some oil.

519
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,957
Wait, I've got oil. Hold him!

520
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,584
I'm holding him.

521
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,462
C'mon!...

522
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,091
Say the blessing man!

523
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,388
Hold him!

524
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,225
No, no, no. It's North Lincoln. Just a
block from Bundy.

525
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,436
Marcus James Dalton,
by the authority of the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood,

526
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,564
l annoint you with this oil which has been
set aside for the blessing of the sick.

527
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,817
In the name of Jesus Christ Amen.

528
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,985
North Lincoln.

529
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,445
Let me seal. Take his hands.

530
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,826
Marcus James Dalton, in the name
of Jesus Christ and by the power

531
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,579
of the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood,
I seal this anointing which has been made by a worthy

532
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,916
and faithful preisthood holder. I
leave a blessing upon thee...

533
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,152
Okay, let's go, let's go!

534
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:06,477
Dr. Betrune, 7203.
Dr. Betrune, 7203.

535
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,662
Why don't you come with me?

536
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,380
A brain tumor is a very difficult thing
to treat.

537
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:21,301
They operated and took most of it
out before his mission...

538
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,846
but, they didn't get it all.

539
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,641
It stopped growing and that's when
he put in his papers.

540
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:33,355
He had to go through chemotherapy, radiation.
He lost a lot of his hair,

541
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,315
he lost his energy.

542
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:42,156
I think that's why they sent him here,
because we have the best cancer center in the world here. Just in case.

543
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,075
He's got maybe three or four
months left.

544
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,537
You can learn a lot from him in that
time.

545
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,956
You're not sending him home?

546
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,500
I tried sending him home. He won't
go!

547
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,398
Hey, how ya doing?

548
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,485
What day is it?

549
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,737
It's Thursday.

550
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,949
We got a 3:30 appointment.

551
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,162
Take Sandoval.

552
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,206
Yeah, sure.

553
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:37,002
Just rest.

554
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,046
3:30.

555
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,592
I got it.. .3:30... Sandoval.

556
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,053
Take Sandoval.

557
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,349
I'll take him. I'll take Sandoval.

558
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,034
What's that again?

559
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:15,666
As l was saying, family relationships
do not have to end with death.

560
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,336
Couples can be married for eternity
in temples.

561
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,672
Didn't I tell somebody to take out
this trash?

562
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,716
I'll do it in a minute! I'm talking to
somebody here!

563
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,304
I'm sorry.

564
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,223
Go ahead.

565
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:41,358
Families can have the promise that if they live
worthy the y can endure forever, not just until death.

566
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,277
Let me get this straight...

567
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:49,283
You're telling me that even after I'm dead...
I'm gonna be with my family and all?

568
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,035
That's right. But only if you live
worthy, of course.

569
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,455
Look guys...

570
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,335
I really don't think I'm interested.

571
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:10,929
That's my mom and that's my dad.
He lost a little weight since then, though.

572
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:16,101
Those... are my little brothers.

573
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,232
There she is. The one I told you
about...

574
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,570
she's waitin' for me.

575
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:31,366
My little brothers are gonna get at
her. I know they will.

576
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,995
Isn't she gorgeous?

577
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,581
She's beautiful.

578
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,958
Where's the rest of them?

579
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,544
...the mission pictures?

580
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,880
Oh, right here.

581
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,550
Wow!

582
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,052
Can't afford to get them developed.

583
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,805
I figure... I'll just wait until I get
home and do it all at once.

584
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,726
Probably cost me... about a
hundred thousand bucks.

585
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,365
Hey! Get outta here!

586
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,993
That's not funny!
That's just plain childish!

587
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,958
Somebody get back here and close
that door!

588
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,635
I've had enough of this
childishness.

589
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,138
Short sheetin' beds, pictures on the
toilet.

590
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,433
It's getting way out of hand. Way
out.

591
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,399
I can't pray this morning. I don't feel like praying.
I feel like strangling somebody.

592
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,360
Mangum, you sa y the prayer.

593
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,653
I said it yesterday.

594
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,948
While Pops is gone I'm in charge.
That's what the president said, so you say the prayer.

595
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:59,788
Father in Heaven, thank thee for
this day and for a good night's rest.

596
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,875
And please bless Pops that he'll be
back with us again very soon.

597
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,921
And bless us today that we'll have a
good day out there on the streets.

598
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:12,092
In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

599
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,595
Amen. Let's just eat and put this
childishness behind us.

600
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,140
What'd you want? Granola?

601
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,601
No, I think we got a bad box.
Gimme the sugar puffy things.

602
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,323
Dalton's death bed...

603
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,533
Pops, its Allen?

604
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,034
Yeah. Where are ya?

605
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,620
I'm just on the street right now in
Hollywood.

606
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,164
Are you wearing your watch? Do
you know what time it is?

607
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,623
Yes, I know what time it is.

608
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,708
Alright, what are you doing?

609
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,669
We're on our way to that discussion.
Who are you taking?

610
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,545
Kinegar.

611
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,379
Take Banks.

612
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,425
Why? Just take Banks. And hurry up,
you're going to be late.

613
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,136
Fine. I'll take Banks.
Alright. Goodbye.

614
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,640
Take Banks.

615
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,517
Figures.

616
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:13,737
Yeah, okay, you see what I'm asking... what's that all about?
Blacks aren't good enough to be priests?

617
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:19,159
I already told you blacks can be priests.
Look at me. Do I look white to you?

618
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,537
You are starting to look a little white
to me, yeah.

619
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:27,918
And what is this 1978 stuff?
Why couldn't we hold the priesthood before then?

620
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,714
My daddy was a good preacher.
Why couldn't he have been a Mormon preacher?

621
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,842
The first thing you gotta
understand...

622
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,094
Oh, I understand all right.

623
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:41,932
It's that the priesthood isn't a right,
it's the authority to act in God's name.

624
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,811
It's not just something you can take on yourself.
I mean, it has to be given to you.

625
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,522
By the white man?

626
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,650
No, you're missing the whole point.
It's not about race.

627
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,445
It is about race! It's always about
race!

628
00:51:55,445 --> 00:52:00,450
And what about that part in the Bible, you know the part where
it says God accepts e verybody no matter what race they are?

629
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,495
Right! That's absolutely right!

630
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:07,707
And that's when the apostle Peter was
commanded to take the church to the gentiles,

631
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,752
the white people, because before
that it had only gone to the Jews.

632
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:15,590
It's another kind of parallel.
It's the ancient church of Christ with the Latter-Day Church of Christ.

633
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:21,137
And it's probable that we were the first church in the country
to have black leaders in front of white congregations.

634
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,765
That's right. And I think what Elder
Banks is trying to say...

635
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,852
Hey, nobody cares what you think.
Alright?

636
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:32,774
And even when the Jews had the gospel,
even when they had the priesthood, not all the men had the priesthood.

637
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:37,988
Only the tribe of Levi. They were the only ones that
were given the authority to officiate in the temple.

638
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,198
And that's in the Old Testament.
You can look it up.

639
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,366
And that's another thing,

640
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,660
Why just the men?

641
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,996
Why couldn't I be a Mormon
preacher?

642
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,748
I'm sure I know more about the
Bible than he does.

643
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:53,420
Yeah.
That's the last thing that you all want is a black woman behind the pulpit

644
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,966
It's the Lord's Authority. It's the
power to act in his name.

645
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:03,138
He gives it to whome ver he sees fit,
whenever he sees fit. That's all there is to it.

646
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,182
So, when is he gonna let us
women have a bit of it?

647
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,310
Is he ever gonna let us have it?

648
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,644
I don't know.

649
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,980
You'll just have to ask him that.

650
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,276
Boy, they are makin' a fool outta
you.

651
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,282
You're going. I know you're going.

652
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,533
How do you know?

653
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,077
Because we've been together three
months.

654
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,246
I've been in the same ward for five.

655
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,290
Yeah, there's no way. You're outta
here.

656
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,834
Hey, Steerman was in Westwood
for seven.

657
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,419
No wa y!
Yeah.

658
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,504
I could talk to Beecroft for you.

659
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,799
What? We're kinda tight.

660
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,927
That guy owes me.

661
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:42,886
I'm sure.

662
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:44,763
Here.

663
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,890
Thanks.

664
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,434
Thanks.

665
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:58,610
I didn't even know about this stuff
until after I was baptised.

666
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,697
Threw me for a loop you know?

667
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:07,452
It's like the Lord just led me smack
up against a big, brick wall.

668
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,956
I read everything I could find on it.

669
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,125
I asked everbody else what they
thought.

670
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:25,637
I called this guy, this African guy, I
mean, a real African guy.

671
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:31,393
This Mormon guy and I didn't even meet him,
I just knew that he was black.

672
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,729
He didn't help any.

673
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:43,488
You know,
my brother served his mission in Mexico and he baptised like 80 people.

674
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,280
No wa y!

675
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,951
Yeah, I'm gonna be pretty embarrassed when I go home with,
like twelve.

676
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,121
Twelve is good. That's nothing to be
ashamed of.

677
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,665
Really... 12's good?

678
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,291
Yeah.

679
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,627
80's better, but 12's good.

680
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,047
80's better.

681
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,591
Well, 12's good.

682
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,803
I was on this youth activity thing
and...

683
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:12,100
We rode a bus out to Nauvoo,
to Carthage where the prophet was killed.

684
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,018
Have you ever been there?

685
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:18,106
Well, they walk you through the jail and they show you the rooms and...

686
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:23,194
then they take you to the room where
the mob broke in and killed the prophet.

687
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:29,451
And they play this tape, this audio
tape.

688
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,290
Man, my heart just broke open,

689
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,753
and all my pride went away.

690
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,549
And trying to look good in front of
my friends and I just started to cry.

691
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,262
And not because I was sad,

692
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,474
...because I was full of light.

693
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,477
I was full of heat.

694
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,981
And it wasn't me.

695
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:07,155
It was like the Spirit of the Lord just
came in and sat in my body.

696
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,117
And I knew right then...

697
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,037
that all of it was true...

698
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,664
all of it.

699
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,087
It's like I wanted to share that with
them you know?

700
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,465
But I couldn't...

701
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,802
cause it's sacred.

702
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:36,142
Sometimes I think God does it on
purpose.

703
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,356
It's like He gives you a hundred
reasons to believe,

704
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:45,401
and then He just drops one or two
for you not to believe.

705
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,696
So that you can choose,

706
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,867
to see if you really want to believe.

707
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:03,461
I am Sandoval the Lamanite!

708
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:10,760
Oh, Hollywood! The days of your
probation are past.

709
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,430
You have procrastinated the day of
your salvation

710
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,016
until it is everlastingly too late,

711
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,644
...and your destruction is made
sure.

712
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:24,899
You have sought all your life for that
which you could not obtain,

713
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:29,112
You have sought for happiness in
doing inquity.

714
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,197
So repent, oh Hollywood!

715
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,784
Repent I say. For the day of the
Lord is coming.

716
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:38,997
For not your houses, nor your
mansions, nor your movie deals

717
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,416
will save you from the wrath of God!

718
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,185
Hey.

719
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,854
Oh. Hey.

720
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:10,653
What would you think if the apostles
and prophets weren't telling the truth?

721
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,075
I mean, what if the y believed all
their lives...

722
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,412
worked their way up to the top and
now...

723
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,918
they know it's all a big lie.

724
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:31,466
I mean not just mormonism, but
Christianity, the whole thing.

725
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,012
They won't tell us.

726
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,193
Hey there.

727
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,195
Hi.

728
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,280
The man that was here Markus
Dalton?

729
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,532
I'm sorry, he's gone.

730
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,993
Is he dead?

731
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,538
We came to bring him breakfast, he
had snuck off on us.

732
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,291
Kay, thanks.

733
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,091
Come on!

734
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,832
Gwen Yule, having been
comissioned of Jesus Christ

735
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:49,419
I baptise you in the name of the
Father

736
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:54,924
and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen.

737
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:13,318
"The spirit of God like a fire is
burning

738
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,863
the latter-day glory..."

739
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,698
Well, looked who showed up.

740
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,742
They're looking for you at the
hospital.

741
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,368
I don't think they're gonna find me.

742
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,203
Where's Benny?

743
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,705
He didn't show?

744
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,392
Hi.

745
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,477
Hi.

746
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,149
Can I sit down?

747
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,610
I guess.

748
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,030
Just don't be rude to me, okay?

749
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,656
I wasn't rude...

750
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,912
I was rude...

751
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,414
I'm sorry.

752
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,625
Do you forgive me?

753
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,211
Sure.

754
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,259
I wrote down the names of those
books that you told me about.

755
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,262
I'm gonna read them when I get
home.

756
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,354
Yeah, look at Pops.

757
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,315
Thinks he's still young.

758
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,327
Do you know wh y I came on a
mission?

759
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,248
Because you couldn't get married?

760
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,711
I'm sorry.

761
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,841
I can be a real jerk sometimes.

762
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,177
I almost did get married...

763
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:09,434
I backed out two weeks before the
wedding.

764
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:14,814
He was a returned missionary. We'd
grown up together.

765
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,736
I loved him so much.

766
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:29,412
I wrote him every week... and sent him cookies...
and neck ties... and everything.

767
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:34,250
But when he came home he was
just so... different.

768
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,712
Better, you know?

769
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:42,592
He was just so strong.

770
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,804
And his faith, when he bore his
testomony... wow.

771
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:53,728
And, I couldn't bear my testimony.

772
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,150
I mean, it's not like I was shy or
anything I just

773
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:05,406
...I couldn't say it was all true.

774
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,743
That Joseph Smith was a prophet...

775
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,497
the Book of Mormon's the word of
God.

776
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,625
I believed it, but I

777
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:19,295
I wanted to know.

778
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:23,090
I wanted to be strong like he was.

779
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:33,559
He wrote every couple of weeks
for the first few months...

780
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:39,023
but, he doesn't write anymore.

781
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,324
I'm sorry.

782
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,952
Now I know...

783
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,288
I really do.

784
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,712
Harmer took the van.

785
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,381
Yeah, that figures.

786
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,424
No sign of Benny?

787
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,344
I think maybe he changed his mind.

788
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,846
Let's go get him.

789
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,308
Should we take the bus?
I don't wanna take the bus.

790
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,810
You're not tired.

791
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,938
I'm exhausted, but if I sit down I'll
fall asleep

792
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,357
and if I fall asleep I'll probably lapse
into a coma.

793
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,443
And if I lapse into a coma I'll probably die,
so I don't want to take the bus.

794
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,404
Pops, what time is it?

795
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,572
It's late.

796
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:32,535
What about those girls?
What girls? You know. The girls.

797
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:51,262
What time is it?
They're early.

798
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,615
Hi. We're the sister missionaries.

799
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,284
Elder Dalton said you might like to
speak with us?

800
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:22,418
Man, this is really strange. They're
always here this time of day.

801
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:28,758
Check this out, there's like three
days worth of mail in here.

802
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,232
Have you been a member all your
life?

803
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:47,401
No...

804
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:50,613
Well, yeah, kind of...

805
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:56,410
My mom married this Mormon guy
when I was seven.

806
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,330
So, you know, I got baptised when I
was eight.

807
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:02,416
We were Pentecostal before that.

808
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,961
Pentecostal?
Yeah.

809
01:06:05,961 --> 01:06:07,380
Cool.

810
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,465
Yeah.

811
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,886
You close to him?

812
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:14,929
Your stepdad?

813
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,474
No...

814
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,894
No...

815
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,900
He's in prison now.

816
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:33,114
Turns out he molested some kids.

817
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,492
He traveled around a lot and

818
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,704
he did it in a bunch of different
states.

819
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,835
So, they're taking turns keeping
him.

820
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,046
I'm sorry.

821
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,974
He never touched me or anything.

822
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,396
I'm grateful for that, you know?

823
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:12,111
Count your blessings I guess.

824
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,871
He brought us the church.

825
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:26,459
He baptised me, ordained me.

826
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:33,424
Sometimes I can't...

827
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,718
separate what he gave me

828
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:40,389
I mean, where does the good stuff
stop and the bad stuff start?

829
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:45,936
When I think of what he did...

830
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:56,322
When my mom married him, he...

831
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,908
I had to take his last name.

832
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,203
She wanted me to.

833
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:07,124
Sometimes I just wish I would
change it back, you know?

834
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:15,758
I guess, I just haven't had much
luck in the dad department.

835
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:22,389
Well, people let you down...

836
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,936
at least your real father's there for
you.

837
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,272
I haven't seen him in thirteen years.

838
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,152
I was talking about your real father.

839
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,612
Pops, Pops...

840
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:21,240
Wake up.

841
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,283
What?

842
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,784
Kinegar's gone.

843
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,769
Let's go.

844
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,056
Don't tell me, it's past curfew.

845
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,729
What, are you guys gonna go with
me?

846
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,857
Actually. I was hoping you'd come
back with us.

847
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,533
Read those books I left you.

848
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:48,869
There's a lot of things
in there you should know.

849
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:55,250
Get your hands off me!

850
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,213
Look, I've read e verything you've
read and then some.

851
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,965
Why do you think it took me four
years to join the church?

852
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:04,593
Because I had to know every stupid
accusation.

853
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:08,847
You're gonna go home,
you're gonna research and then you're gonna wish you could come back.

854
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,015
Well guess what?

855
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:14,853
Naw, I know what you're thinking. Look at you,
you were so afraid that you were just gonna disappear.

856
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:18,065
Well maybe I'd believe a little more
too if I had cancer.

857
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,987
You know it's true.

858
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:25,906
I've heard you say it.

859
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,785
I was lying.

860
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,981
This bus goes right through Kansas
City.

861
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,652
Come on.

862
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:11,618
Suit yourself.

863
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:30,262
Elder?

864
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:33,766
Elder?

865
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,061
Yeah?

866
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:45,986
He is wrong... isn't he?

867
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,880
Why are you still here?

868
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:11,720
I keep training you guys...

869
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,014
kids like you.

870
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:19,019
Guys I came out with, they're zone
leaders, assistants to the president,

871
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:22,523
and he just keeps sendin' me you
guys.

872
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,695
Nobody made you come out here.

873
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,534
You could have stayed home.
Nobody would have cared.

874
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,790
What were you thinking?

875
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:44,795
...that you'd put on a name tag and necktie...
and suddenly you'd be a different person?

876
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,881
Your faith would be stronger?

877
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:51,301
Didn't you pray before you came
out here?

878
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,763
Didn't you study?

879
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,975
I can't solve your problems.

880
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:02,479
I can teach you the rules, I can teach you the discussions,
but what you really need to know,

881
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,273
what's gonna get you out of bed in
the morning,

882
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:07,484
get you out on the street and talking
to strangers,

883
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:10,654
I can't teach you that.

884
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:18,078
And I can't convert you, Elder.

885
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:48,478
Father in Heaven...

886
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,900
...I've been in this place for days.

887
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,573
I don't know if I'm doing the right
thing.

888
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,368
I ask...

889
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:10,208
I ask you now to tell me...

890
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:16,882
if this is true.

891
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,694
Father in Heaven...

892
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,374
Father...

893
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:23,115
Father.

894
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:38,588
Hey.

895
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,632
Get up.

896
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,509
Let's do some good.

897
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:50,934
Elders.

898
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,811
Brother Morales, hi.

899
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,689
Hi. Laura's not here yet...

900
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:58,984
she didn't tell me you were coming.

901
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,820
Today we're... here to see you.

902
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,031
Brother Morales...

903
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:10,162
I know you might not believe this,
but we're here on our Father's business.

904
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:15,167
And you might be the first person
that's hearing me say this...

905
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:16,251
...you are.

906
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,671
The messages we've taught you
are true.

907
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:21,882
I know they're true.

908
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:26,178
And I can feel the Lord's spirit is
with us right now...

909
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,889
right here.

910
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:31,975
Can't you feel it?

911
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,107
Well, I know that Laura's felt it.

912
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,651
I know that's she's found what I've
found

913
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,655
and I know that the Lord

914
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,492
wants you to let her join his church.

915
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:53,580
Elders, I really have to get back to
what I was doing.

916
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:58,084
I'll tell Laura you came. She'll be
sad that she missed you.

917
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:01,004
Would you mind if we left with a
pra yer?

918
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,465
Could we kneel?

919
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,425
Of course.

920
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:10,764
Who would you like to say the
pra yer?

921
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,939
Our Father in Heaven...

922
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,786
Would you mind saying the prayer?

923
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,508
Our Father...

924
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,053
who art...

925
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,806
in hea ven...

926
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,456
Our Father

927
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,169
who art in heaven...

928
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:34,097
hallowed be thy name...

929
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:39,936
Elders..

930
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,940
Hi. We just saw your dad.

931
01:21:53,158 --> 01:22:00,165
Thank you, elders, thank you.

932
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:15,347
...and we ask Thee to help us find
Benny as soon as possible...

933
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:19,934
and we ask thee to look after him

934
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:23,980
and watch over him carefully
wherever he may be,

935
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,861
And... we...

936
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:35,367
Yeah, he would have been admitted
probably yesterday or the day before.

937
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:38,953
Okay, yeah, thank you.

938
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:49,381
Hi, yeah,
I'm looking for a friend of mine I'm worried he might have been

939
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,091
in an accident or something...

940
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:53,885
His name is Benny Yao.

941
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:57,555
Y -- A -- O, Yao... Benjamin.

942
01:23:00,892 --> 01:23:01,976
Uh-huh...

943
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,190
Thank you very much.

944
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:11,695
Sent him home an hour ago.

945
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:30,130
What am I gonna do?

946
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:35,135
I never even saw them coming.

947
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:39,097
I was just walking, you know?

948
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:41,057
I was just walking.

949
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,184
They took your money?

950
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:46,020
I didn't have any money!

951
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:51,443
They saw that I didn't have any
money, so they beat me even more.

952
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,988
I can't even walk.

953
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:57,991
I can't sit up.

954
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,536
Hurts so bad.

955
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:03,830
I think I'm infected.

956
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:06,332
Gonna die.

957
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:08,418
Benny, you're not gonna die.

958
01:24:09,043 --> 01:24:12,797
They wouldn't have released you from the clinic if you were gonna die.

959
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:16,009
They sent me home because I don't
have any money...

960
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:19,095
They sent me home because I don't
have an y insurance.

961
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,686
I don't wanna die.

962
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,072
It'll get better.

963
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:41,659
This is just like when my mother
died.

964
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:47,415
I knew that something was wrong,
and the doctor said she would be fine.

965
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:49,793
But she's not fine.

966
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:54,923
My brother, he's laying in the bed and the doctor says he'll be okay,
and he's not.

967
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,929
I thought the y were gonna kill me.

968
01:25:04,098 --> 01:25:06,059
They beat me with their guns.

969
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,605
They beat me, kicked me,

970
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:13,107
they stood on my throat.

971
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:18,655
Look...

972
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,826
they broke my crutches.

973
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:27,080
Why would they break my
crutches?

974
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,798
Elder Dalton...

975
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:39,592
they say you're a doctor?

976
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:44,806
No... I never finished medical
school.

977
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,102
I'm sorry..

978
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:52,063
But is there anything you can do?

979
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:32,562
Do you belie ve in Jesus Christ?

980
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,523
I do.

981
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:39,527
Do you believe that he died for your
sins and that he has all power,

982
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:42,697
even to raise you from the dead if it
is his will?

983
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:48,912
I do.

984
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:19,067
Benjamin Yao,

985
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,528
by the authority of the Holy
Melchizedek priesthood

986
01:27:22,528 --> 01:27:28,534
I anoint you with this oil in the name
of Jesus Christ, Amen.

987
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,753
Benjamin Yao...

988
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:41,005
by the authority of the Melchizedek
priesthood

989
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:46,010
I seal this anointing and following the prompting
of the Spirit I leave a blessing with you

990
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:48,429
our Saviour has told us that...

991
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:51,474
...if we knock, he will answer, if we
ask...

992
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,768
we shall receive.

993
01:27:56,646 --> 01:28:03,486
Our Father in Heaven has heard your many prayers these
many nights as you ha ve asked for the ability to walk.

994
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:13,246
This day, Benn y, you will receive
this great blessing.

995
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:20,169
Through your faith in our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ, and through the power of the priesthood

996
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:25,967
you may rise from this bed and walk
and from this day forward you will walk

997
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,510
and not be weary,

998
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:30,596
and you will run and not faint.

999
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:37,395
This is the blessing you desire,
and this is the blessing that our father in Heaven desires for you.

1000
01:28:37,895 --> 01:28:42,442
And I leave it with you in the name
of Jesus Christ, Amen.

1001
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:44,986
Amen.

1002
01:29:31,115 --> 01:29:32,700
They just called me at work, and...

1003
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:45,546
I don't know. I was just thinking, they didn't let
me out, and then I couldn't see him. And then I
thought that maybe he died. I don't want him to die.

1004
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:49,258
He's not gonna die... he's not gonna
die.

1005
01:29:51,177 --> 01:29:53,054
Elaine.

1006
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:34,345
I'm so glad

1007
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:53,281
Wow...

1008
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,326
I feel...

1009
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:07,670
Hey, Pops...

1010
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:09,547
You doin' okay?

1011
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:15,219
Yeah, are you kidding? We've got
three baptisms on Saturday.

1012
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:16,888
Yeah.

1013
01:31:17,471 --> 01:31:18,681
Yeah.

1014
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:21,601
Yeah! Woo!

1015
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,362
Hey, Elder?

1016
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:34,739
Yeah?

1017
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:37,408
We did some good today.

1018
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:41,996
Yeah...

1019
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:44,081
Yeah we did.

1020
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,859
Hey, its 6:30, let's go...

1021
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:18,324
Companion prayers, let's go!

1022
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:22,370
Pops?...

1023
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:24,580
Elder Dalton?

1024
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,961
I'm Gene Dalton, Mark's dad.

1025
01:33:55,212 --> 01:33:57,423
Excuse me.

1026
01:34:10,686 --> 01:34:12,313
Hi, pal.

1027
01:34:42,134 --> 01:34:47,139
If a few of you will come forward and grasp the casket
by the handles firmly, then we'll proceed to the...

1028
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:51,394
We'll handle this. Can you just give us a few minutes alone?
We'll take care of it... thank you.

1029
01:34:54,438 --> 01:34:56,148
Elders, come on up here and help.

1030
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:00,111
President...

1031
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:02,238
maybe you could...

1032
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:07,243
say a few words since we're not really
gonna get a chance to say good-bye.

1033
01:35:22,174 --> 01:35:24,510
I can't help but think of the
scripture...

1034
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:28,639
"Greater love hath no man than
this,

1035
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,226
that he lay down his life for his
friends.

1036
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:36,939
Three years ago Elder Dalton found
out...

1037
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:39,817
that He wouldn't grow old...

1038
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:44,363
that he probably wouldn't get married,
and that he wouldn't have children.

1039
01:35:44,363 --> 01:35:50,661
Most men would've cursed God and
given up, he came here.

1040
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:52,663
He chose to be with us.

1041
01:35:53,706 --> 01:36:00,212
And there isn't a day goes by that I don't run
into somebody whose life Elder Dalton touched.

1042
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:12,641
Somebody that he taught. Somebody that he trained,
or reached in and pulled out of the world and into the light of the gospel.

1043
01:36:13,392 --> 01:36:17,062
Now, he wasn't perfect, we all know
that.

1044
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:21,484
He had faults and weaknesses and
he made mistakes.

1045
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:25,946
He lacked patience, he lost his
temper.

1046
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:28,240
He even flirted with my wife.

1047
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:37,374
But he was just like we are, imperfect,
even clumsy spiritually sometimes.

1048
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:41,879
But other times perfect...

1049
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:45,549
if only for a moment, in his heart,

1050
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:49,762
and he had his eye single
to the Glory of God.

1051
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:54,266
Now I want you elders to know

1052
01:36:54,808 --> 01:36:58,354
that even though you may not give your
lives as dramatically as Elder Dalton,

1053
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:02,358
that you are heroes and martyrs.

1054
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:13,285
You are giving your lives,
your hours and your days and your months and years in service of God.

1055
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:20,751
"Whosoever will save his life shall
lose it,

1056
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:25,548
and whosoever will lose his life for
my sake shall find it."

1057
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:30,594
Elder Dalton has lost his mortal life,

1058
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:35,140
but we know that he's found his
eternal life.

1059
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,602
Amen.

1060
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:39,770
Amen.

1061
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:43,774
Amen.

1062
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:09,652
President Beecroft didn't let us
grieve too long.

1063
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:13,739
He told us to get right back to work.
Transfers came two days later.

1064
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:17,201
Only one person from our district
was moved.

1065
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:18,869
We knew it was going to happen.

1066
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:22,373
I'm gonna miss you.

1067
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:23,540
I'm gonna miss you.

1068
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:27,127
Sister, Costa Mesa, huh?

1069
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:28,337
Yup.

1070
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:29,338
Go get them.

1071
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:30,798
Thanks.

1072
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:33,092
Sister, it's been a pleasure.

1073
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:34,218
Good luck with everything..

1074
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:35,344
Thank you.

1075
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:38,806
Hey, I'll call you when I come
across some good books.

1076
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,307
Alright..

1077
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:45,145
Try not to drive too many people out
of the church.

1078
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:50,234
Yeah, maybe somebody in Costa Mesa can do something with that hair.

1079
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:20,973
Kinegar's replacement finally
showed up,

1080
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:24,184
...another spud named Elder Rex.

1081
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:26,729
He arrived with my new companion,

1082
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:29,982
...Elder Downey, from Salt Lake
City.

1083
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:32,025
How ya doin'?

1084
01:40:32,025 --> 01:40:32,735
Hey.

1085
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:34,153
So where're you from?

1086
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:35,446
Kansas.

1087
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:38,615
Ah, Kansas, wow! Big tornadoes,
right?

1088
01:40:38,782 --> 01:40:39,116
Yeah.

1089
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,162
Cool.

1090
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:51,211
Help my sister please, she's been
looking for a job for so long...

1091
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:59,011
I just hope that she finds a job that she
likes and that she feels good about.

1092
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:02,514
"For all have not every gift given
unto them.

1093
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:08,812
"For there are many gifts,
and every man is given a gift by the spirit of God".

1094
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:25,788
...and bless us with thy spirit as we go out on the streets today,
we pray,

1095
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:28,207
in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

1096
01:41:28,207 --> 01:41:29,291
Amen.

1097
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:36,340
Alright. Let's do some good.

1098
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:39,843
Hi.

1099
01:41:42,304 --> 01:41:45,182
Everything worked out as Pops had
hoped.

1100
01:41:45,974 --> 01:41:48,769
On Saturday I performed my first
baptism,

1101
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:52,815
...actually my first three baptisms.

1102
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:55,734
Thanks Mangum.

1103
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:59,822
Later that night we taught 15 of
Benny's friends and family.

1104
01:42:00,155 --> 01:42:05,369
Within the next three months,
eight of them were baptised, including his sister.

1105
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:11,917
Dalton was right, the field is white and ready to harvest,
even in Los Angeles.

1106
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:19,007
The last I heard Laura was going to Ricks college and she was engaged.

1107
01:42:19,424 --> 01:42:21,677
Her father never did join the church.

1108
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:24,638
He died of a heart attack three
years later.

1109
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:31,812
One year to the day after Benny's baptism,
he left for his mission to Taiwan.

1110
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:37,693
He served a successful mission and he's now the
mission leader in the Santa Monica Third Ward.

1111
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:43,448
Brother Rose ne ver went back to drinking coffee,
but he is still giving free rides to the missionaries.

1112
01:42:43,448 --> 01:42:46,994
I recently heard that Carla did get
baptized.

1113
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,663
It took two years and a major career
change,

1114
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:53,333
but now she's the spiritual living
teacher in her relief society.

1115
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:59,798
Sister Monson went home and somehow within a year,
she became a secretary for one of the general authorities.

1116
01:42:59,798 --> 01:43:03,552
She married a construction worker
and ga ve birth to twins.

1117
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:07,764
Magnum found out that his father had
sold his car to help pay for his mission,

1118
01:43:07,764 --> 01:43:12,769
so he stole his father's motorcycle and went off on a cross country tour.
He didn't come back.

1119
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:16,565
Finally, President Beecroft bumped
into him in Casper, Wyoming.

1120
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:19,443
He was living in a trailor behind a
truck stop.

1121
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:23,697
He was a cook,
his girlfriend was a waitress who was expecting their first child.

1122
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:28,243
They gave president a free bowl of chili,
president gave them a free wedding.

1123
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:38,378
Sandoval the Lamanite used the Navy to help him finish college.
The Navy is now using him to train torpedo men somewhere in Virginia.

1124
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:40,213
He's married, no kids yet.

1125
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:44,384
He says he's going to retire at 42 and
live the rest of his life on a houseboat.

1126
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,720
His wife says otherwise.

1127
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:50,098
Banks returned to Los Angeles after
his mission.

1128
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:56,855
He studied comparative religion at Loyola University and
married Elder Sandavol's little sister in the L.A. Temple.

1129
01:43:56,855 --> 01:44:00,817
He now teaches seminary to high school students in St.
George, Utah.

1130
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:06,239
I don't know what happened to Kinegar.
I ne ver heard if he came back to the church or not.

1131
01:44:06,531 --> 01:44:09,076
My parents, so far, have not.

1132
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:14,414
Elder Downey and I became good friends.
We still talk every month or two.

1133
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:22,381
We talk about all the people we taught, all our companions,
all of our funniest, and all of our most sacred experiences.

1134
01:44:23,423 --> 01:44:29,972
As for me, when I went home,
I transferred all my credits to Brigham Young University.

1135
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:33,600
My first day of class, my freshman
English teacher became ill

1136
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,438
and was permanently replaced by a
graduate student named Jeanine Fronk.

1137
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:40,732
We were married two months later.

1138
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:44,027
Somehow I still got a C in English.

1139
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:50,826
We're thinking 40 years from now,
maybe we'll go on another mission...

1140
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,744
...together.

1141
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:57,416
Oh, yeah, two months shy of our
first anniversary

1142
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,710
we had a baby boy,

1143
01:45:00,752 --> 01:45:03,255
a beautiful baby boy.

1144
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,215
We named him Dalton.

1145
01:45:05,674 --> 01:45:07,926
Dalton Allen...

1146
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:11,263
Mostly...

1147
01:45:11,346 --> 01:45:13,890
we just call him Pops.
