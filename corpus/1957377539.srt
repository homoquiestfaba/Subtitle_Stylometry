for your bail?

until my trial.

food on the table
when you're locked up?

You're gonna have to go on welfare.

- No. No, no. Uh-uh.
- Just for a little bit.

no welfare case, all right?

on welfare? Huh?

some insurance, Chino.

away from me, what do I got?

on your finger?

you need from me.

do me a favor and take them.

I don't have any money left
and that's all they gave me
was the stamps.

00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:16,402
We're thinking about marketing...

689
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,238
Price, Price...
Let her talk.

690
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:21,307
Okay.

691
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:25,211
Okay, I got, I got a lot of ideas,

692
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,546
but, um, my first idea,

693
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,782
and, I don't want to diss...

694
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,452
But I, uh...

695
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,321
I think you should
get your teeth fixed.

696
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,923
- Huh?
- (LAUGHS)

697
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,291
My teeth? What the fuck
is wrong with my teeth?

698
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,960
There is nothing wrong
with his teeth.

699
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,729
I tell him all the time
about his teeth.

700
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,197
Ricky, look,
let me tell you something.

701
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,266
I think that you're really fine.

702
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,868
But, I mean,
sometimes I see you
in your videos, right?

703
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:54,273
And you look so sad
and serious, you know, like,
like you don't want to smile.

704
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,308
Yeah, and he sucks on his lip.
Like that.

705
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,410
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- He does that every time.

706
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,212
I can't wear braces.
I got an image.

707
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,847
Nobody wants you to wear braces.

708
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:05,051
Who said...
That's not gonna happen.
He doesn't need braces.

709
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:08,454
My sister Alexis
is all about her image.

710
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,022
She wore braces.

711
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,923
She had them
in the back of her teeth.

712
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,392
Nobody could see them.

713
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,728
Yo, Rick, that's a fat idea, man.

714
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,864
You should listen
to this girl, man.

715
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,899
Yeah, I mean, listen,
we're just being straight
with you.

716
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,803
- Yo, thanks for everything,
man.
- I think he's drunk.

717
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,505
Our lawyers'll be
in touch, all right?

718
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,274
- I am very happy.
- Better be all that.

719
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,608
All right, and more...

720
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,110
You can't leave me
with him, please.

721
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:33,145
- Can I take you home?
- Oh, guys, guys,

722
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,381
I can take her home,
it's right on my way.

723

724
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,385
Yeah, well, I mean, I can...

725
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,919
It's not far from me.
It's not far.

726
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:43,789
I know when I'm not wanted, man.

727
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,657
Listen, baby, maybe
some other time.

728
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:46,892
- Take care.
- Okay. Take it easy.

729
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,761
- Bye, Ricky.
- Bye, Lissy. Be cool.

730
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,463
- Yo, we'll be in touch.
- All right, you guys.

731
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,764
Later, Price.

732
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,534
Bye!

733
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,603
What a night.

734
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,405
Oh, I can't believe it, man.

735
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,340
Tony and Ricky Mendez.

736
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,509
They were so nice.

737
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,811
They'd better be nice.
I'm doubling their
record sales.

738
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,246
I really like this job.

739
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,748
Job? Who said
anything about a job?

740
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,583
Val said that if it
worked out, you know,

741
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,286
maybe I could be your
assistant for real.

742
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,754
I helped you sign them.

743
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,489
No. Wait a minute.

744
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,790
Wait a minute. I signed them.

745
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:22,361
I. Me.
I signed the Mendez brothers.

746
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,029
Maybe Tony Mendez
thought you were cute.

747
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,932
No, no, no, no.
They liked my ideas.

748
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,901
Look... There's no job.

749
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,073
Whoa. Hey.
Whoa, whoa.

750
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:36,608
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

751
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,845
You said... You said
you were gonna drive me home.

752
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,514
To the Bronx?
Are you out of your mind?

753
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:43,815
No, no.

754
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,417

755
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:46,885
I don't think so.

756
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:49,121
Oh, oh, I think so.
Here. Here's more money.

757
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,824
Look, don't make me go off,
all right?

758
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,393
You don't want to see me go off.

759
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,229
I don't want to
see you "go off"?
What does that mean?

760
00:34:57,296 --> 00:35:00,599
I don't want to
see you go off?
Maybe I do.

761
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,001
But I want to see you get out.

762
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,336
That's what I want. I want.

763
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,971
Now is the time
to get out of my car.

764
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,706
Come on, we've had fun.

765
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,242
Time to go. Taxi!

766
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,444
Out we go. Come on, come on,
come on, let's go.

767
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:13,945
Let's go!

768
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,114
Look, how about I
tell Tony Mendez you didn't
even drive me home.

769
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:17,483
Ooh, yeah, let's do that.
Come on.

770
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:20,085
Or how about I tell him
I'm not your assistant?

771
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,254
- What's that?
- His phone number.

772
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,590
Oh, yeah? Really?

773
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,325

776
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,070
Too much air for you?

777
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,372
Yeah, could you just
watch the road, all right?

778
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,641
Keep your eyes forward
and watch the road.

779
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,144
What are you doing?

780
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:47,513
Look, give me, I'll put it, I'll...

781
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,680
Look, you're gonna make us...

782
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,748
Just relax.

783
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:50,916
I'll do it, all right?
I'll do it.

784
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,118
Then put it on.
It's a great tape.

785
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:55,787
Oh, please,
I'm not putting them on.
I heard of them.

786
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,289
You have not heard of them.

787
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,659
They're so new they haven't
even made a record yet.

788
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,794
They played at my cousin's
block party, all right?

789
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,963
- They got booed
off the street.
- Yeah, right.

790
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,233
I've heard them sing.
Listen to the demo.

791
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,335
Yeah, well, maybe
you heard them,
but I saw them.

792
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,802
I'm telling you...
Uh, the...

793
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,638
One of the guys sings,
he does everything.

794

795
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,309

lip-synchs to his tape.

796
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,011

it's your business?

okay? Oh, shit.

801
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,898
No, I'm just vacationing.

No. It's because I'm such
a nice guy.

also to Mr. Soto,

859
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:04,803
No, no, no. No, no.
I don't want to talk to him.

860
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,406
Just, um... Tell him
about my cubicle, all right?

861
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:10,075
Okay. Okay. Bye.

862
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,276
Mami!

863
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,447
What are you doing here?

864
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,215
I came for my tits.

865
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:18,684
You said I could borrow them.

866
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,487
For one night, Nana.
Not for your whole life.

867
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:24,289
If I give them back to you
now, my boss is gonna know
that I stuffed myself.

868
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,857
How embarrassing is that?

869
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,193
Look, you wouldn't even
have this job
if it wasn't for me,

870
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,161
and then you turn around
and you steal my tits.

871
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,097
No, Nana, that's too shady, okay?

872
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,732
All right, fine.
Okay, you want them?

873

(BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH)

874
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,335
- Come on!
- Wait a minute.

875
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:39,705
You're so greedy and selfish
with everything. Here.

876
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,306
I'm so selfish?
They're my tits!

877
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,709
Why is it being selfish
if I wanna put on
my tits, huh?

878
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,179
You want socks?

879
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,616
No, I don't want socks.
I don't want nothing from you.
Thank you very much.

880
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,618
Bitch.

right?

ALEXIS: No, not a bitch,
you're a thief.

883
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:56,988
Did you lose this?

884
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,324
Hi.

885
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,426
Ninita, give Pee Wee
his bottle, please.

886

This is... This is
my sister Alexis.

887
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,463

with the Lamborghini, huh?

890

- Uh, yeah.
- Uh, Mr. Price, I, um,

891
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:15,306
I wanted to talk to you about
the, um, marketing campaign.

892
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,474
The marketing campaign?

893
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:19,244
- No.
- No. What do you mean, no?

894
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,713
No, I, um...

895
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,849
I don't think that, uh...

896
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,450
It's not a good idea.

897
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,721
What's not a good idea?

898
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:34,025
You know, uh,
let Val and I come up
with the ideas. Okay?

899
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,128

Oh, Mr. Lamborghini...

902
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:45,370
Do you notice
anything different
about Lisette?

903
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,975
Yeah. I think so... What...

904
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,309
Your hair.

905
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,845
Your hair looks different.

906
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:55,747
I like it.

907
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,054
You get so stupid sometimes.

908
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,023
How come you didn't
tell me he was fine?

909
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,658
Because I'm married, all right?

910
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,760
- But you think
he's fine, right?
- No, I do not think he's fine.

911
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:11,630
Ma, you like that white man?

912
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,232
No, I do... Alexis,
do you see what
you're starting?

913
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:17,703
Look, this is the only man
that I like, okay?

914

915
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,472

918

and go for yours.

- Word.
- With who?

926

927
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,598
I was hurting for you, man.

928

like somebody
was getting fucked.

Man, you didn't see it.
Stop making shit up, man.

930
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:54,272
But Jose, from 246,
he told me he saw everything
from his window, bro.

931
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:55,907
- Yeah?
- So everybody knows my shit?

932

or something, bro?

they was doing, so, all right?

actually swear, Chino,

there were actually
fucking and shit.

of that Lamborghini, B.

- Yo, Lamborghini, bro.

He was fucking her, man.

940

You better not
be bullshitting me, man.

941
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,668
What'd I tell you?
We shouldn't have
said shit, bro.

942
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,836
Because he gets all sensitive, man.

943
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,471
I ain't sensitive.

Hi.

00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,781
Where's Alexis?

1201
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:26,316
I don't know.
Pee Wee was crying.

1202
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:30,054
Give him to me.
You could go now.

1203
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,156
-No, I got him.
Look, he's calm now.
-What's the matter with him?

1204
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:36,160
Sit down, relax,
take a load off your feet.

- Chino...
- Here you go. Look.

1210
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,575

Sniff it.

put him down and go?

is what you want,

Could I have a puppy now?

00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:32,042
Did Papi promise you
a puppy if you came
out here, mama?

1240

Did he? It's okay.

Huh?
Was that for me?

1283
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:26,590
Maybe I had to go to Magdalena
because I wasn't getting
what I needed at home!

What weren't you getting?

1286
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:33,230
Maybe I got tired of hearing,
"Hurry up and finish!"

1287
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:36,033
Well, maybe
if you did it right,
I wouldn't want you to finish.

1288

I do it right! All right?

spontaneous.

I make crazy, stupid love...

1291
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,442
But you don't appreciate that
because you don't know how
to make love to a man!

1292

Maybe if I had a man, I'd know!

and Magdalena, okay?

Yes, and I wasn't
drinking sangria, either.

well, how come
you married me?

Mama, you were pregnant.

1320

- Alexis, I am
a very sexual person, okay?
- Hey, don't scream.

1326

telling me what I am
and what I'm not, all right?

something else?

more money than you do.

LISETTE: You hear that,
Chino?

1334
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:12,990
The stupidest bitch you
ever met makes
more money than you.

1335

If I went on welfare, Chino,
I would still bring home
more money than you did!

Come on, Minnie.

1339
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:28,505
So you gonna come with me
or you gonna stay with her?

1340
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:41,518
- Ouch!
- What's your problem, Minnie?

1341
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:42,987
You never cry like this
when Mami combs your hair.

1342
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,554
Mami doesn't hurt my head.

1343

- Ma.
- What?

1344
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,992
Ma, could you fix her hair?

1345
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:49,960
I don't know how
to comb nappy heads.

- Come on, come on.
- Come on, Ma, please!

Stop it! Get back here!

1348
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,734
Listen, the problem
is that you married
a women with bad hair.

1349
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,437
In my family, nobody
had nappy heads.

1350

-In my family, we all had
pure Castilian blood.

- Well, excuse me.
- Stop.

And listen, you can
do me a big favor...

1353

When you find this wild
little animal,
will you put this on him, huh?

1354
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:17,621
C, don't give Abuela
a hard time, okay?

1355
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,323
I got to go to work.
Put your clothes on.

1356
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:20,925
I ain't wearing that 'mo shit.

01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:12,067
You want to do that as a cover?

1856
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:16,605
Yeah, yeah,
and then they could do it
in English and in Spanish.

1857
01:31:16,672 --> 01:31:18,306
That way, it could cross over.

1858
01:31:20,576 --> 01:31:22,811
-What? What?
What's the matter?
-Shh.

1859
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:25,413
I don't know, I'm just...

1860
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:29,885
I'm looking at the video.
Uh, okay.

1861
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:32,287
So you got
the Mendez brothers, right?
They're on the beach...

1862
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:33,722
- Right.
- Coney Island.

1863
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:35,891
Beautiful women.

1864
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:37,392
(STAMMERING) Wait.

1865
01:31:37,459 --> 01:31:39,327
No, I mean, the beach,
I like the beach, right?

1866
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:42,765
- But it's gotta
be one girl. One.
- Okay. One woman.

1867
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:45,133
But one amazing woman.

1868
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,604
Yeah, but not some
oiled-down video ho.

1869
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:51,206
No, no, because the song
is about talking.

1870
01:31:51,273 --> 01:31:54,376
- It's actually not
about fucking at all.
- Exactly, exactly. That's it.

1871
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,846
And then, and then, like,
we could show,
like, Ricky Mendez, right?

1872
01:31:57,913 --> 01:32:00,448
And he's walking
behind surf, you know,
and he's like,

1873
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,417
"Man, what could I do
to bring her back?"

1874
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:03,686
You know?
He's, like, really...

1875
01:32:03,752 --> 01:32:05,988
And then, and then, Tony Mendez,

1876
01:32:06,054 --> 01:32:08,356
- he comes along with
his brothers, right?
- Right.

1877
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:10,225
And he comes up to Ricky,
who's all sad,

1878
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,094
and he says, "Hey, man,
why don't you just try..."

1879
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,797
"Try a little tenderness,"
right! Yeah!

1880
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:16,498
I'm gonna train you for Val's job.

1881
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:17,600
Wait a minute.

1882
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:19,034
I know. Hold on.

1883
01:32:19,101 --> 01:32:20,402
Look, Price, why are you fronting?

1884
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:21,604
You don't want to sleep with me.

1885
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:24,472
Oh. Oh, yes, yes, I do.

1886
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,141
Come on, Price,
you do this all time.

1887
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:27,843
You got your desk drawer
full of condoms.

1888
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:29,612
You got your pine air freshener.

1889
01:32:29,678 --> 01:32:32,514
Yeah, I've made love
with women here before.
Does this bother you?

1890
01:32:33,148 --> 01:32:34,983
- No.
- Good.

1891
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:37,720
What bothers me is being
with somebody who doesn't
even know I'm there.

1892
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:40,055
I had to make a phone call, okay?

1893
01:32:41,089 --> 01:32:43,358
Look, I don't want to diss...

1894
01:32:43,425 --> 01:32:46,528
- Good.
- But you're not
a very sexual person.

1895
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,198
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

1896
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:52,567
Is this because I had
to make a phone call?

1897
01:32:52,635 --> 01:32:54,569
- No. No.
- You know, there was
a crisis in Puerto Rico.

1898
01:32:54,637 --> 01:32:55,638
Do you understand that?

1899
01:32:55,704 --> 01:32:57,640
What do you want me to have said?

1900
01:32:57,706 --> 01:33:02,210
"I was making love to my young
and talented assistant.
I'll call you right back"?

1901
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:05,247
Whatever. Okay, look...
Do you want me
to set up a meeting

1902
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:08,383
- with the Mendez brothers?
- No, I don't. I don't. I'm...

1903
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:13,622
This is weird, you know?

1904
01:33:13,689 --> 01:33:15,290
I'm feeling very uncomfortable.

1905
01:33:16,659 --> 01:33:19,728
Look, Price, there's no
weirdness here, okay?

1906
01:33:19,795 --> 01:33:22,397
I did it with you once,
I'm not gonna do it again,
that's it.

1907
01:33:23,365 --> 01:33:24,933
I'm not a sexual person?

1908
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,869
I... Yeah... No.
I can't work like this.

1909
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:31,173
So...
What do we do now?

1910
01:33:34,677 --> 01:33:36,044
Maybe, uh...

1911
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,883
Maybe, uh, you should find a...

1912
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:45,120
Maybe you should work
for a different boss.

1913
01:33:45,187 --> 01:33:48,490
- Are you quitting?
- No. No, I'm not quitting.

1914
01:33:53,095 --> 01:33:54,863
So what are you saying?

1915
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,598
You gonna fire me?

1916
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:03,171
Fine, fire me.

1917
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:08,643
Book some studio time
for the Mendez brothers.

1918
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:11,079
And get outta here, please.

1919
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:13,081
I gotta make a phone call.

1920
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,217
I know how much you hate that.

1921
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,407
(CLATTERING)

1922
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:42,577
What are you doing?

1923
01:34:56,558 --> 01:34:58,626
Can you throw me
that roller, please?

1924
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:06,068
Thank you.

1925
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:18,947
You got the gas on?

1926
01:35:25,253 --> 01:35:26,554
I'm talking to you.

1927
01:35:32,427 --> 01:35:34,229
Chino, you can't just turn it on.

1928
01:35:34,296 --> 01:35:36,031
You gotta light it.

1929
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:50,678
So... How's your new job?

1930
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:54,149
- You like it?
- It's kind of boring.

1931
01:35:54,216 --> 01:35:56,718
I just sit in one place.
It's not like riding a bike.

1932
01:35:56,785 --> 01:36:00,388
You should get one of those,
you know, portable TVs.

1933
01:36:02,657 --> 01:36:04,426
- Maybe next blackout.
- (CHUCKLES)

1934
01:36:07,229 --> 01:36:08,797
So how's your boyfriend?

1935
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:12,400
I don't got a boyfriend.

1936
01:36:12,467 --> 01:36:13,902
Then what about that thing
you gave me?

1937
01:36:13,969 --> 01:36:15,838
Look, it only happened once,
all right, Chino?

1938
01:36:15,904 --> 01:36:17,505
It's not even any of your business.

1939
01:36:18,673 --> 01:36:19,875
All right, all right, I know.

1940
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:21,844
It's none of my business.
It's over between us.

1941
01:36:22,945 --> 01:36:24,312
You do what you want to do.

1942
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:26,014
I wasn't asking because
I was jealous or anything.

1943
01:36:27,349 --> 01:36:28,851
I was a little curious.

1944
01:36:28,917 --> 01:36:30,518
So how is Magdalena?

1945
01:36:36,091 --> 01:36:37,625
I wouldn't know.

1946
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:39,227
I'm not with her anymore.

1947
01:36:40,428 --> 01:36:42,464
Angel is Ritchie's father.

1948
01:36:47,769 --> 01:36:48,803
Oh.

1949
01:36:52,007 --> 01:36:54,042
I'll be honest with you.

1950
01:36:54,109 --> 01:36:56,644
Everything I ever felt for you
is dead,

1951
01:36:56,711 --> 01:36:59,447
and I would never, ever want
to get back together.

1952
01:36:59,514 --> 01:37:00,983
Yeah, well, I feel
the same way, Chino.

1953
01:37:01,049 --> 01:37:02,717
I'm just staying for the kids.

1954
01:37:09,024 --> 01:37:12,227
I mean, I look at you
and I see you and him
doing the rawest shit.

1955
01:37:12,294 --> 01:37:13,962
I mean, things
that we didn't even do.

1956
01:37:14,029 --> 01:37:15,363
Well, it's none of your business...

1957
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,465
So you shouldn't even
think about it.

1958
01:37:17,532 --> 01:37:19,167
Believe me, I don't want
to think about it.

1959
01:37:19,234 --> 01:37:20,903
All I'm saying is that
if we talk about it,

1960
01:37:20,969 --> 01:37:22,604
then maybe we won't
wonder about it.

1961
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,172
But if you're too shy...

1962
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,908
I'm not shy...
What do want to know?

1963
01:37:27,209 --> 01:37:28,310
Wait a minute.

1964
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,822
You write down everything
that you and him did,

1965
01:37:40,889 --> 01:37:42,690
and I'll write down everything
me and Magdalena did.

1966
01:37:42,757 --> 01:37:45,293
Then we'll pass notes
and we'll never
talk about it again, okay?

1967
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:52,200
Concentrate on your own paper.

1968
01:38:13,155 --> 01:38:14,722
- You finished?
- Yeah.

1969
01:38:41,383 --> 01:38:43,185
How did you find time
to go to work?

1970
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,556
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

1971
01:38:48,623 --> 01:38:50,959
Wait, here, number 11,
you guys didn't do that?

1972
01:38:51,026 --> 01:38:52,427
Is it on my fucking paper?

1973
01:38:52,494 --> 01:38:54,229
If I didn't write it down,
it didn't happen.

1974
01:38:54,296 --> 01:38:56,698
I just wanted to make sure
we both wrote everything down,
okay?

1975
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,601
Yeah, well,
I wrote everything down,
all right?

1976
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:00,735
I'm going to bed.

1977
01:39:00,802 --> 01:39:02,437
Lisette, Lisette.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1978
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:06,074
Could I just ask you
one more question?

1979
01:39:10,178 --> 01:39:11,513
Go ahead, Chino.

1980
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:13,581
Ask me one more question.

1981
01:39:17,085 --> 01:39:18,720
Was he better than me?

1982
01:39:24,926 --> 01:39:27,529
Um, let me think...

1983
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:29,831
Well?

1984
01:39:40,442 --> 01:39:41,476
No.

1985
01:39:45,213 --> 01:39:47,649
Ah! Yeah!

1986
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:51,253
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew he...

1987
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:52,687
How could he be better than me?

1988
01:39:53,588 --> 01:39:55,257
Yes! Yes! I knew it.

1989
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,724
I knew that. I knew that.

1990
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:58,026
You didn't even have to...
I knew it.

1991
01:39:58,093 --> 01:39:59,527
I'm telling you
I feel so much better now.

1992
01:39:59,594 --> 01:40:00,962
Oh, my God!

1993
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:03,331
Lisette, let me...

1994
01:40:03,398 --> 01:40:05,167
Lisette, Lisette...

1995
01:40:05,233 --> 01:40:06,634
I feel so much better now.

1996
01:40:06,701 --> 01:40:09,337
I don't know about you,
but I feel... I feel great.

1997
01:40:09,404 --> 01:40:10,905
I mean, it's getting better now.

1998
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:12,840
I'm looking at you right now,
and I don't see you and him

1999
01:40:12,907 --> 01:40:14,376
doing a bunch
of horrible things anymore.

2000
01:40:14,442 --> 01:40:17,212
I don't. I mean,
I see you guys doing...

2001
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:18,413
I see you guys doing...

2002
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,382
One horrible thing, I'm...

2003
01:40:20,448 --> 01:40:25,453
Yeah, and now I just see
you and her
doing 42 horrible things.

2004
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,988
Thanks a lot, Chino.

2005
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:42,036
- What's your problem?
- You know
what your problem is?

2006
01:40:43,105 --> 01:40:46,007
You never think
about the other person.

2007
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:05,860
# She may be weary

2008
01:41:08,029 --> 01:41:12,100
# And them young girls
They do get weary

2009
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:16,238
Good night, other person.

2010
01:41:16,304 --> 01:41:20,074
# Wearing that
same old shaggy dress

2011
01:41:20,142 --> 01:41:21,343
It's morning, Chino.

2012
01:41:22,777 --> 01:41:24,979
# But when she gets weary

2013
01:41:25,046 --> 01:41:26,381
Good morning.

2014
01:41:26,448 --> 01:41:28,850
# You gotta try
a little tenderness

2015
01:41:30,785 --> 01:41:33,588
# You know she is waiting

2016
01:41:34,489 --> 01:41:37,091
# Just anticipating

2017
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:39,161
# The things

2018
01:41:39,227 --> 01:41:44,999
# That she'll never, never
possess... No, no, no

2019
01:41:45,066 --> 01:41:47,502
# Oh, as she's waiting there

2020
01:41:49,704 --> 01:41:52,140

But I gotta live
my life strong

2087
01:46:17,271 --> 01:46:21,175

it's gonna take some time

2088
01:46:21,242 --> 01:46:26,280
# I wanna make up my mind
'Cause I am wasting
precious time #
