Mark.

7
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,949
Now, remember, gentlemen,I want Komati taken alive.

8
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,606
There's that look again.

00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,260
What look?

00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:14,438
Been some different aboutyou the last few missions.

You're right.

20

Let's go to work.

21
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:41,030
Yeah.

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:41,987
It's not work.

23
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:42,901
It's justice.

I don't need to
remind you that there

So you get to Komati and
you get to him quickly.

27
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,749

cut off your balls

them if they catch you.

make it out of here.

00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,670
What about Alex and Val?

78
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:28,715
They broke discipline.

79
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:29,672
That was their decision.

This is mine.

We're never gonna make it.

83
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,074
No.

84
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,292
Just go and hold the chopper.

00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:42,206
Go, man!

We've got wounded coming in.

Let's get out of here.

89
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:27,687
One minute is all I'm
asking for, one minute.

90
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,384
Put that away before
you hurt someone.

91
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,396
You know, if
this was the army,

92
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,354
you'd be court marshalled again.

Hi.
I'm Alex.

00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:21,392
You're expected, sir.

Mr. Russo.

102
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,905
I don't like getting involvedin decisions at this level,

103
00:12:56,036 --> 00:13:00,997
but people count on the TNT,important people, many of them

104
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,520
in the US government.

105
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:08,396
But Alex, I cannot havemy two best men bickering

106
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,006
over petty differences.

107
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:22,889
I could quit.

108
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,109
Oh, you can't quit.

109
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,763
There's too much at stake.

110
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:28,764
There's too much to be done.

111
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:33,464
Can I get you a scotch?

112
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:34,378
Huh?

113
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,166
Miles, why don't you takea break for a few minutes?

114
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,732
Go wait in my office, would you?

115
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:48,088
Miles, a by the book soldier.

116
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:51,961
He'll do anything you ask him toand not a damn thing you don't.

117
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,397
And that's the problem.

118
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,705
You see, I need men who
can think on their feet,

119
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:02,363
react to changing situations,improvise, adapt, overcome.

120
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,279
That's why I brought
you in from Europe.

121
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:10,414
You will have your own TNTteam, Alex, one day very soon.

122
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:15,419
But in the meantime, Milesis your commanding officer.

123
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,552
It's a difficult
reality, but the reality

124
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:24,951
is always difficult.

125
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:25,865
Thanks for the drink.

126
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,393
Alex, the hostage
whose life you saved,

127
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:35,700
he is the general managerof our uranium mine.

128
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:45,145
The people who support the TNT,they know who you are, Alex.

129
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,798
And they're not going toforget anyone who's helped

130
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:47,887
them out of a tight spot.

131
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:00,377
Well?

132
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,425
I wouldn't let
him out of my sight.

133
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,998
Gentlemen, meet
Carlos Saldivia,

134
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:14,217
Cuban trained leader
of the second largest

135
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:17,090
drug cartel in Mexico.

136
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,570
Our estimates figure thatin just the last year,

137
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,964
half of the Colombian
dust snorted

138
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:28,362
or smoked in the southeasternUS netted Carlos $2.3 billion.

139
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,191
That's tax free.

140
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:36,326
A very rich man with onlyone vise, his mistress.

141
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:40,461
He visits her in
Tampico every Thursday.

142
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:45,118
Naturally, the wife and familyare at home in Mexico City.

143
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:49,513
So everyone in the
convoy is fair game.

144
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,237
They're late.

145
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:02,412
Maybe they're not coming.

146
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:03,674
They'll be here.

147
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:04,849
Let's just keep alert.

148
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,124
OK.

149
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,690
All right.

150
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,563
You gonna tell me what'sbothering you or what, Alex?

151
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:25,783
I don't trust Russo
and I don't trust Miles.

152
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:29,265
Maybe we are doing
their dirty work.

153
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,788
What makes you say that?

154
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,139
I'm not sure we'reworking for the government.

155
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,488
All right.

156
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:37,665
Let's say Russo is
being dishonest with us.

157
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,145
What can you do?

158
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,494
Quit.

159
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:41,886
Nobody quits unless
Russo wants them to.

160
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:45,151
You know that, Alex.

161
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,326
You'd be looking
over your shoulder

162
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,240
for the rest of your life.

163
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:08,043
Yeah, I need to
account for four

164
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,349
shipments that were
supposed to come

165
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,915
through our warehouse in Texas.

166
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:14,310
I do business with
who and where I want.

167
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,269
I no fear you.

168
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:19,141
I fear no one, not even God.

169
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:27,018
They always think
they're invincible.

170
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:30,631
And then, they die.

171
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,519
Here they come.

172
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,477
Show time.

173
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,391
All right.

174
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,479
What do you got?

175
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,438
It's a four unit convoy.

176
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,440
I thought there weresupposed to be three vehicles.

177
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,615
Nothing's changed.

178
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,749
Let's just stick to the plan.

179
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:02,663
One leading.

180
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:03,577
One clean.

181
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,720
I got a visual.

182
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:31,518
I am go in 5, 4, 3, 2--

183
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:32,432
Fire.

184
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,613
Hey, Carlos, what's the rush?

185
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:28,792
Finish him, shooter six.

186
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,887
Get him before he
breaks for the woods.

187
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,427
Please, god.

188
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:55,254
No.

189
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:58,779
No.

[gunshots]

191
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:41,604
It's not your fault. Alex.

192
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,432
Alex, don't.

193
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:44,303
Alex.

194
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:57,577
Alex.

195
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,447
Alex.

196
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:05,411
I killed the wife and the kid.

197
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,022
And you told me no civilians.

198
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:08,892
Yeah.

199
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:11,286
So?

200
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,374
You knew it.

201
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:13,375
Didn't you?

202
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,507
You fucking knew it.

203
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:15,377
Yeah.

204
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:16,987
So?

205
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:17,901
Hold it.

206
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,340
Alex.

207
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:26,736
Alex.

208
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,176
Come on.

209
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,235
Come on, Alex.

210
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,498
Let's get out of here, man.

211
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,282
ALEX [RECORDING]: My
name is Alex Cheval.

212
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,763
For the past five years, I'vebeen a member of the Tactical

213
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:56,853
Neutralization Team, theprivate armed force financed

214

00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:02,381
to perform assassination
and acts of terrorism.

216
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:14,131
Names, dates, missionprofiles, it's all in here.

217
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:17,657
Plus, he's made copies
to send to the media,

218
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:20,355
in case anything happens to him.

219
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,618
I told you to watch him.

220
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:23,532
Sir--

221
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:25,752
No one does this to me.

222
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:26,840
Now, you go out today.

223
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,582
You find him right now.

224
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:31,714
And you eliminate him.

225
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,934
Sir, he was the
best man on the team.

226
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:36,719
And even if we
could locate him--

227
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,765
Carrying out orders
is what I pay you for.

228
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:39,635
OK?

229
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:08,316
Hey, Murphy.

230
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,231
Can you get that
tied up by yourself?

231
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,232
Yeah.

232
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:12,668
[inaudible]

233
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,236
Whoa, whoa, whoa wait.

234
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,763
You haven't paid
for the trip yet.

235
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:21,634
Hm?

236
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:35,909
I'm gonna go take a shower.

237
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:41,392
Looks like you
don't need a shower.

238
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:42,350
I am wet.

239
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,569
I am cold.

240
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:44,787
I'm gonna take a shower.

241
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:47,486
So let's go take it together.

242
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:52,360
If we shower together,I will never get to class.

243
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,494
Well, you know what's
important, don't you?

244
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:56,886
I know that I
have 30 psychology

245
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:59,149
students waiting for me.

246
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,063
I have to go.

247
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:03,589
ALEX: Don't go.

248
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,860
I'll be back in
two hours, Sailor.

249
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:21,476
Do you think she like us?

250
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:22,346
Yes, she does.

251
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,224
Top of the morning
to you, Sheila.

252
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,138
Good morning.

253
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:32,095
How's the family?

254
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,837
Fine.

255
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:35,838
Hey, Mark.

256
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,231
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey, guys.

257
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,580
What's up?

258
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:39,538
I've been following
your diet and I'm

259
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,061
really starting to bulk up.

260
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,323
Can't you tell?
- Yeah.

261
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:43,237
You're looking great.

262
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:44,107
Thanks a lot.

263
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,108
See you later.

264
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,153
Bye.

265
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:47,807
See you guys.

266
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:48,677
Hey, be careful.

267
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,291
Morning, sheriff.

268
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:55,989
Morning.

269
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,602
I am the Maytag repair
man of law enforcement.

270
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,996
That's because
of your reputation.

271
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,128
See, criminals, they
live in fear of you.

272
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:06,782
So they stay away.

273
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:09,829
Is that right?

274
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:12,266
So where's your better half?

275
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:15,835
She's enlightening the
youth of this nation.

276
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:16,923
Yeah?

277
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:17,750
When did she give up teaching?

278
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:23,756
I know it's none of mybusiness, but when are you gonna

279
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:24,931
ask that girl to marry you?

280
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,589
You're right.

281
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,765
It's none of your business.

282
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:35,768
She;s a good girl,Jamie, smart as they come.

283
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:38,988
Although I have seriousdoubts about her taste in men.

284
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,644
I think she'd make
you very happy.

285
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:45,516
What makes you think
she'd even say yes?

286
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,083
You got to ask, friend.

287
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:49,346
That's the only way youever get any kind of answer.

288
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:51,218
You gotta ask.

289
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:52,436
I got to go to work.

290
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:53,350
See you.

291
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:19,159
Is there a problem, sheriff?

292
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,030
Is this your vehicle?

293
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,510
Yeah.

294
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,121
SHERIFF: It's a crosswalk.

295
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:26,427
Oh.

296
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,168
Sorry.

297
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:29,909
I didn't see the-- the markings.

298
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,522
Normally, that's a $15 fine,but this one's on the house.

299
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,219
Oh, thanks.

300
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,438
I appreciate that.

301
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:39,440
Visiting or passing through?

302
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,270
Oh, I'm visiting.

303
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,575
Well, enjoy your stay.

304
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,752
But obey the
parking regulations.

305
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,362
We've got some
seniors in town who

306
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:50,756
work themselves into a
pretty good lather when

307
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,409
their crosswalks disappear.

308
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,893
[stomach grumbles]

309
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,826
[inaudible]

310
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:39,500
OK, everybody,
the last 30 seconds.

311
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,936
[inaudible]

312
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:48,378
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

313
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:49,292
Cool down.

314
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:52,687
Nice job, everybody.

315
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:53,601
OK.

316
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,515
Everybody, that's it.

317
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,299
The same time tomorrow.

318
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,953
And don't forget to stretch.

319
00:28:58,084 --> 00:28:58,780
All right.

320
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:04,438
BARBARA: Mark.

321
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,919
Yeah?

322
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,703
I like sweating with you.

323
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:09,791
You're a good coach.

324
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:10,792
Sure.

325
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:12,011
Sweating is good for us all.

326
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,013
Yeah.

327
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:17,059
You know, I'm sure you're busymost nights, but, you know,

328
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,150
if you ever feel like spendinga couple hours, maybe we could--

329
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:24,197
Thanks, Barbara, but
I'm in a relationship.

330
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:26,373
Oh.

331
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:28,244
Doesn't seem to
matter to most people.

332
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,550
ALEX: No.

333
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,508
I don't suppose it
does, but thanks.

334
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,083
She is such a slut.

335
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:42,258
Who's that.

336
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:43,129
Boob-bra.

337
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,046
The world is a lonely place.

338
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,699
Yeah.

339
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,441
Well, I doubt she's spenttoo much time alone in it.

340
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:54,401
Hey.

341
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:55,881
It's my dad's birthday today.

342
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,013
You didn't mention that.

343
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,408
Yeah, well, he says at his age,he's trying to forget them.

344
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:04,280
Sheriff Jim, he can't
be much older than what?

345
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,238
70?

346
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:06,979
75?

347
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:09,111
Look, we're having alittle surprise party tonight

348
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,418
at 8 o'clock, Bullwinkles.

349
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:13,942
Mind if I bring Jamie?

350
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,815
That'd be OK I
guess, just as long

351
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:19,165
as you don't ruin the surprise.

352
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:21,036
Just remember, there's
a great jukebox there

353
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:25,084
and I love to have
the first slow dance.

354
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:27,913
I don't think Jamie wouldlike that, but it's OK.

355
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,829
I think a little jealousy'sgood for a relationship.

356
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,096
That one's mine.

357
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:38,967
Hey, hey.

358
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:41,230
You guys look like a
couple of smart kids.

359
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,627
Ever seen this guy before?

360
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,455
And if we did?

361
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:53,852
Uh, well, an extra
candy bar for you.

362
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:58,726
Never saw him
before in my life.

363
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:08,997
Ow.

364
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:20,879
ALEX: Well, let's
play Blackjack.

365
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:27,886
Another one?

366
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,322
[bark]

367
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:34,109
OK.

368
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,632
What about another?

369
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:36,851
[dog whines]

370
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:37,721
Just checking.

371
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,731
I'm tired of losing
all the time.

372
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:50,386
So what do you get if you win?

373
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,822
He buys the
groceries for the week.

374
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:55,478
Thanks.

375
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:58,220
SHERIFF: You're welcome.

376
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,918
Well, I guess I should
wish you a happy--

377
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:00,788
oops.

378
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,224
Birthday?

379
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,573
That's all right.

380
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,401
I already know about
the surprise party.

381
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:06,925
Carrie doesn't know I know.

382
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,317
Oh, but I know.

383
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,885
She tried, put it off
to the last minute,

384
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,932
hoping she could fool me, butshe's pretty much hopeless.

385
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:20,721
You know, I've been
thinking about what

386
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,941
you said this morning.

387
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:26,422
And I've done things
I'm not very proud of.

388
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:27,728
No convictions.

389
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,599
No outstanding warrants.

390
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,080
And you never served any time.

391
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,603
You checked me out.

392
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:36,041
I check out everybodythat moves into this town.

393
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,651
It's nothing personal.

394
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,393
It was before I knew you.

395
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:43,352
I feel I can't reallyask Jamie to marry me if I

396
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:46,921
don't tell her about my past.

397
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:50,664
And if I do, I'm not
sure she will marry me.

398
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,886
I'm not sure she will
talk to me again.

399
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,541
Just exactly what did you do?

400
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:01,980
[music playing]

401
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:17,473
Well, you're gonna have to tellher about it sooner or later,

402
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:19,998
because the past has a wayof jumping out of the bushes

403
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,263
and biting you in the asswhen you least expect it.

404
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:25,438
Hey, Jim.

405
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,266
Hi yourself.

406
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:28,180
ALEX: Hi, honey.

407
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,616
Hi, baby.

408
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:31,270
You know, I'd like to
stay, but I gotta run.

409
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,272
I know the two of youget plenty to talk about.

410
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,361
And I've got a surprise
birthday party to go to.

411
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:36,275
Yeah?

412
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:37,319
Whose?

413
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,233
Mine.

414
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:43,804
So what?

415
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:44,979
What do we have to talk about?

416
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:53,031
Do you want to go to Jim'sbirthday party tonight?

417
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:53,944
JAMIE: Yeah.

418
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:54,945
ALEX: Good.

419
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,164
Well, let me get dressed.

420
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,061
[SINGING] For he's
a jolly good fellow,

421
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:27,456
for he's a jolly goodfellow, for he's a jolly good

422
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:32,592
fellow, which nobody can deny.

423
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:33,897
SHERIFF: Thank you.

424
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,595
I appreciate that.

425
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:38,032
You know, I always admiredpeople who could carry a tune.

426
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:41,122
And you can't.

427
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,646
Don't ever quit your day job.

428
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:45,605
You've got a lot to
say for an old man.

429
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:48,564
Why not use some of that
hot air on the candles?

430
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:58,400
Oh, I love this song.

431
00:34:58,531 --> 00:35:00,359
Let's go dance.

432
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:01,490
What about the cake?

433
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:04,754
It'll be here
when we get back.

434
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,321
Save me a big piece.

435
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,844
Oh, I'll keep you a big one.

436
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:08,976
JAMIE: Cut me off a corner.

437
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,283
All right.

438
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:14,112
Pass me a few plates and
I'll serve everybody.

439
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:15,025
OK.

440
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,222
Really do look like theybelong together, don't they?

441
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,358
Not all that much they don't.

442
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,364
Hey.

443
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:50,931
Want another round?

444
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,411
OK.

445
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,934
$3.50.

446
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:55,892
All right.

447
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:56,893
How about now?

448
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:06,686
You count it.

449
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:07,600
It's all there.

450
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:24,791
He promised me
his first dance.

451
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:27,446
Well, if he promised
you the first dance,

452
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,143
we can't disappoint him, can we?

453
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:30,057
No.

454
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:38,283
I know what you're
worried about.

455
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:42,461
You think I'm too young.

456
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:48,554
So does your father.

457
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,208
And he has a gun.

458
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:57,171
Hi.

459
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,216
Hi.

460
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:00,043
Can I get a couple beers please?

461
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:01,131
Yeah.
Sure.

462
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,307
Are you with the party?
- Yeah.

463
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,177
Great.

464
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:03,482
I'll put it on the tab.

465
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,444
Here you go.
- Thank you.

466
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:10,358
Bye.

467
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:19,193
Whoa, whoa, whoa now.

468
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,804
This is where you
belong, sweetheart.

469
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:24,503
The sheriff is
right over there.

470
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:25,678
Yeah.

471
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,636
Well, let him get his own woman.

472
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:33,294
Excuse me.

473
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,219
We're not looking for
trouble, gentlemen.

474
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,176
Then, go away.

475
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:56,796
Which part of go away
don't you understand?

476
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,540
I'm not here to fight, guys.

477
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,544
Oh, now, I see why
they call it gay Paris.

478
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,256
Oops.

479
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:23,605
Look like I spilled a little.

480
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:27,174
Excuse me.

481
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,658
Boy, I think that's
about enough, don't you?

482
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:34,355
Hey, sheriff.

483
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:37,227
He started it, sheriff.

484
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,882
I know you boys probablywant to apologize to Mark here,

485
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,188
don't you?

486
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,058
Sorry.

487
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:51,416
Course, I know for afact, he wouldn't accept it.

488
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:54,114
So just leave it
be and sit down.

489
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:57,247
Yes, sheriff.

490
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:58,161
Thank you, Jim.

491
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:05,473
That was a very
noble thing to do.

492
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:10,696
They're jerks.

493
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:12,132
What else can you say?

494
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,046
Nothing.

496
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:20,749

moment, won't you, Basu?

Is this the fifth timeyou found him or the sixth?

503
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:39,855
No, no, no.

504
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:42,684
This time, I really found him.

505
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,469
Is that so?

506
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,645
You showed some real
restraint there, friend.

507
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,041
You know, I have a lectureto give in the morning at 9:00.

508
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:53,521
I haven't even
started to prepare it.

509
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:56,829
So maybe we should go.

510
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,439
OK.

511
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,354

Wasn't me.

it's gotten a hell of alot easier since the days

JAMIE [PHONE]: OK.

556
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:32,827
ALEX [PHONE]: I'll
see you there.

557
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:33,698
JAMIE [PHONE]: Bye.

558
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:40,182
Conversation just now.

559
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:43,751
And the conversation you hadwith Alex in this offense

560
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:46,667
for the mission down in Mexico.

561
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:49,017
Mhm.

562
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:50,889
Perfect match.

563
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:52,630
Mhm.

564
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,979
OK.

565
00:43:54,109 --> 00:44:00,550
Just-- just what are
the odds of two men

566
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:03,684
having the same voice print?

567
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:05,425
About the same as
me becoming the pope.

568
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:06,295
Not likely.

569
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:25,880
Where we going?

570
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:27,055
Colorado.

571
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:28,013
What's the OP?

572
00:44:28,143 --> 00:44:28,840
Taking down Alex.

573
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,671
You got a problem with that?

574
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:35,542
Why would I have
a problem with that?

575
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,459
Well, I don't expect him togo down without a serious fight.

576
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:42,070
I can't risk insubordination.

577
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:45,421
We're all professionals
here, Miles, all of us.

578
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:46,292
Good.

579
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:06,268
Look around you, Mark.

580
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:08,618
This is where I grew up.

581
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:13,972
This is who I am just,everything out in the open.

582
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:14,842
No secrets.

583
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:21,980
I've been with you
for almost a year now.

584
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,678
How much do I really
know about you?

585
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:25,548
I mean, really?

586
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:31,772
It's so great when
we're together.

587
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:34,601
I love being with you.

588
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:39,171
But last night, you were likea complete stranger to me.

589
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:41,260
There is so much about
you that I don't know.

590
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:51,270
What you don't know about meis not worth knowing, Jamie.

591
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:57,667
My life was nothing
before I met you.

592
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:58,538
Nothing.

593
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:05,893
I don't want to lose you, Jamie.

594
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:37,289
Good to have you
back, [inaudible]..

595
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:39,247
Let's get this place wired.

596
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:47,212
Hey, where's the
swimming pool out here?

597
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:58,805
You giver her the ring yet?

598
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,328
I'm working on it.

599
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:02,635
Welding it in your shop?

600
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:03,549
Here.

601
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:04,419
Try this one.

602
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:08,119
Whoa.

603
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:09,685
That's a big gun.

604
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:10,599
Yeah.

605
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:11,774
I'm sorry.

606
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:12,688
That way.

607
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:20,218
What are you doing?

608
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:34,145
Nice shooting.

609
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:36,756
Thank you.

610
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:42,327
First, you have to
get to know the gun,

611
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:44,677
til it feels kind
of like part of you.

612
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,334
Kind of like a
woman you relate to.

613
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,521
Pretty good.

614
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:04,566
Thanks.

615
00:50:04,697 --> 00:50:05,698
Why don't you just do it, man?

616
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:08,483
Just ask her to marry you.

617
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:11,269
Tell her whatever
she wants to hear,

618
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,836
even what you won't tell me.

619
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:14,924
And then, pop the question.

620
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:20,017
Try the small one.

621
00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:24,804
Alex, don't.

622
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:26,284
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

623
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:39,645
Nice shooting.

624
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:40,515
Thanks, Jim.

625
00:51:56,548 --> 00:52:02,554
You know what makes Alex trulydangerous is the way he thinks.

626
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:05,513
He won't come in the
way we expect him to.

627
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:08,734
He knows we'll be channelingour efforts there.

628
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:11,302
He won't come in the
second way either.

629
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:14,566
He'll know that we'll at
least have that covered.

630
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:16,350
No.

631
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:17,960
We'll be coming in a third way.

632
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,753
Stay with her,
but not too close.

633
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:28,667
Don't worry, boss.

634
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:29,624
I got her.

635
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:50,036
And that's where we'll
be waiting for them.

636
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,646
Yeah.

637
00:52:51,777 --> 00:52:53,909
We'll just have to resistthe temptation of blowing

638
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,824
his brains out til
we at least know he

639
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:58,087
has the tapes, all the tapes.

640
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:29,989
But we can still
fuck him up, right?

641
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:30,859
Of course.

642
00:53:45,483 --> 00:53:47,354
Shit.

643
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:48,355
Where is she?

644
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:49,269
I don't know.

645
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,183
BASU: Where is she?

646
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:51,097
She disappeared.

647
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,426
Come on, Mark.

648
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:16,775
Oh, baby.

649
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:17,645
Thank god you're there.

650
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:19,386
ALEX [PHONE]: Hello.

I'm not here to take yourcall, but please leave

653
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:24,957
your message after the beep.

654
00:54:25,087 --> 00:54:26,654
Mark, listen, where are you?

655
00:54:26,785 --> 00:54:27,960
I need you.

656
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,397
Somebody followed
me from school.

657
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:32,791
And um-- OK.

658
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:33,661
Wait.

659
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,712
DORRIS [PHONE]:
Sheriff's department.

660
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:42,017
Oh, hi.
It's Jamie Wheeler.

661
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:44,150
Listen, somebody's following me.

662
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:49,547
Um, I'm at my house right now,but they were really close.

663
00:54:49,677 --> 00:54:51,549
Hello?

664
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:52,376
Hello?

665
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:57,685
DORRIS [PHONE]: Station

666
00:54:57,816 --> 00:55:00,340
Are you there, Jim?

667
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:02,168
About a mile and a half
away from you, Dorris.

668
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,996
DORRIS [PHONE]: Jim, wejust got a call from Jamie

669
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:05,214
Wheeler up at her place.

670
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:06,781
She's real upset.

671
00:55:06,912 --> 00:55:07,956
I think she was
trying to tell me

672
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:09,306
that someone was following her.

673
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:10,872
And then, she got cut off.

674
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:12,221
10-4.

675
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:13,179

DORRIS [PHONE]: OK.

676
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,093
Out.

677
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:23,363
That's great.

You're amazing.

Thanks.

680
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:53,741
We just walked up.

681
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:55,700
And there he was.

682
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,701
Oh my god.

683
00:55:56,831 --> 00:55:58,137

684
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:05,840
VAL [VOICEOVER]: Nobody quits,unless Russo want them too.

685
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:07,102
You know that, Alex.

686
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:08,277
You'll be looking
over your shoulder

687
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:09,235
for the rest of your life.

688
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:13,761
Shit.

689
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:14,849

ALEX: Jamie?

698
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:56,081
Correct me if I'm
wrong, but I think

699
00:57:56,211 --> 00:58:00,433
your past just snuck out of thebushes and bit me in the ass.

700
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:02,087
I'm going to call for help.

701
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:03,523
Take your time.

00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:05,482
Listen, if you
die on me, I'm never

703
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:08,615
going to speak to you again.

704

00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:19,583
The Sheriff has been shot.

709
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:20,584

711
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,505

[phone ringing]

713
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,922
Alex?

714
00:58:55,053 --> 00:58:57,185
Or should I say, Mark?

715
00:58:57,316 --> 00:58:58,796
Is she all right?

716
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:02,321
Oh, she's just peachy.

717
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:05,542
Miles, don't hurt her.

718
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:08,806
Alex, Alex, I'm notinterested in hurting her.

719
00:59:08,936 --> 00:59:11,852
What I'm interested
in is a trade.

720
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:13,637
Your friend for the tapes.

721
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:14,942
OK.

722
00:59:15,073 --> 00:59:17,249
Whatever you want,
I'll give it to you.

723
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:18,990
You know where to find me?

724
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,469
Yeah, I do.

725
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,212
Good, then I'll expect
you sooner than later.

726
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:28,695
And Alex, don't
get cute with me.

727
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:38,313
This woman of yours, she'svery, very breakable.

728
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:21,988
Did you boyfriend
ever tell you about us?

729
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:28,560
Yes?

730
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:29,430
No.

731
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:40,354
He didn't tell you he usedto kill people, for money?

732
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:41,616
No.

733
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:42,661
He never got around
to that, did he?

734
01:04:52,714 --> 01:04:55,674
You're lying.

735
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:56,588
Am I?

736
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:56,648
He's down in the woods, justthe other side of the river.

737
01:05:56,778 --> 01:05:58,650
[inaudible],, go and

01:07:00,233 --> 01:07:01,539
Come in.

746
01:07:01,669 --> 01:07:03,410
Advance from the bridge
and secure the woods.

747
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,977
He hasn't crossed
the river yet.

748
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:05,934
He has to cross the river.

749
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:06,848
Do it.

750
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:07,719
Now.

751
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:11,549

CHOI: Roger that.

755
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:57,638
How do you do it?

756
01:07:57,769 --> 01:08:05,472
I mean, how do you
kill a woman, a child?

757
01:08:05,603 --> 01:08:06,821
I mean, how?

758
01:08:06,952 --> 01:08:10,086
They're-- they're
innocent people.

759
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:13,219
I mean, do you do
it from a distance

760
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:16,744
so you don't have to
look into their eyes?

761
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,050
Or do you just
come in from behind

762
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:20,618
so you don't see their face?

763
01:08:20,748 --> 01:08:24,230
That's a terrible thing, tolet go of your own humanity

764
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:25,101
[inaudible].

765
01:08:28,756 --> 01:08:29,931
You can get it back.

766
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:35,502
It's called collateral damage.

767
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:43,075
And the only reason
you're still here

768
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:45,121
is because we want tokill you in front of him.

769
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:52,650
He's gonna kill you.

770
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:56,828
He's gonna kill all you.

771
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,612
And no one will even care.

772
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:10,494
Ramirez, stay sharp.

773
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:12,365
Ramirez, don't be a moron.

774
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:44,005
Choi.

775
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:07,507

776
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:08,465
No, Alex.

Are you OK?

778
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:40,312
I've had better days.

01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:44,534
Mark.

780
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:52,063

No.

789
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:04,516

805
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:34,780

807

Nice wheels.

811
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:46,139
SHERIFF: Yeah, right.

812
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,272
You know, you watchthese all news channels ,

813
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:51,536
you see the same story
15, 20 times a day.

814
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,059

of seeing this one.

REPORTER [TV]:

816

01:17:59,413 --> 01:18:00,284
Well, you look good.

818
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:01,546
He does, doesn't he?

819
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,679
Yeah, you look great.

820
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:06,116
I feel like a Swiss cheese.

821
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:08,118
I owe you an apology.

822
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:11,295
SHERIFF: How's that?

823
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:13,297
Well, for dragging
you into all this.

824
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:14,646
I don't know if
you've noticed,

825
01:18:14,777 --> 01:18:16,256
but I am the law in these parts.

826
01:18:16,387 --> 01:18:19,477
So being dragged into
all this is my job.

827
01:18:19,607 --> 01:18:21,305
Besides, it kind of brokeup the week a little bit.

828
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:31,619
Shoot.

829
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:32,795
I forgot to ask Jim something.

830
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:33,709
What?

831
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:38,888
If he'd be my best man.

832
01:18:43,196 --> 01:18:45,068
If what?

833
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:45,982
It's OK.

834
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:46,809
I'll ask him later.

835
01:18:51,204 --> 01:18:53,380
So what do you think?

836
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:56,688
I think Jim will make
a wonderful best man.

837
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:58,777
Who's the lucky girl?

838
01:18:58,908 --> 01:19:01,214
Well, someone I met.

839
01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:03,173
Well, I hope the two of youwill be very happy together.

840
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,136
We will be.

841
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:11,572
I'm sure of it.

842
01:19:18,144 --> 01:19:19,450
Sorry.

843
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:21,495
It's OK.

844
01:19:21,626 --> 01:19:25,064
So think they're talkingabout getting married?

845
01:19:25,195 --> 01:19:27,458
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

846
01:19:27,588 --> 01:19:29,155
They really do looklike they belong together.
