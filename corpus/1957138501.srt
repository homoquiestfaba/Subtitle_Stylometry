into allegedly
fraudulent tax return filed

929

by three of Alvarez's
six South Texas car dealerships.

930

denying the affair with

for over 30 years.

941

Johnson has been struggling to
overcome his waning popularity

942

in the face of increasing
violence in the county

943

He lives in Del Rio.

He's got a wife,

That was back when being a Texas
lawman still meant something.
