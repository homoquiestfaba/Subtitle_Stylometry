You've always

Buddy: Hey,
you can count on me, okay?

I'll be there.

<i>One Chicken Shake.
Anything else?</i>

26
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,791
No, no, no. I don't want a Chicken Shake.
I was just asking what is it?

27
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,291
<i>Our new Chicken Shake,

I'll just take a Barnyard Bucket.

a Mega Barnyard Bucket</i>

Preble: Hi,
are you Miss Arabella Isadora?

48
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:23,391
Ah, just one second.
I'll get her for you.

49
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,425
Okay.

00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:33,825

51

Arabella Isadora
at your service.

52

What can I do for you,
young man?

53
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:50,892
Ma'am, did you
send me this letter?

54
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:54,592
Ah, yes,
I suppose I did.

55
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,592
Ms. Isadora, it appears we
have no tax records for you.

56
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,491
Please call me Bella.

57
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,892
Bella, it appears we have no tax
records for you or your property.

58
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,892
Ooh, I see.

59
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:07,892
I'm here to perform
a preliminary audit.

60
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,425
Uh, so you'd like
to come in?

61
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:11,959
Yes ma'am,
the sooner I get started,

62
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,925
the sooner I'll be
out of your hair.

63
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,158
Out of my hair
and into my home.

64
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:24,425
To enter, you must lick
the ice cream cone.

65
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,425
No thank you.

66
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:36,458
No thank you.

67
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,391

71
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:14,058
Okay, and what is your
occupation or former occupation?

72
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,924
I... I never know
how to answer this.

73
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,658
Well, recently
I've been painting.

74
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,024
Oh, I'd love
to show you some.

75
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:23,958
And of course
I'm always writing.

76
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:26,892
At the moment I'm writing
a story about an astronaut

77
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,425
who falls in love
with a supernova.

78
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:33,924
And then I've been
composing songs for years

79
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:38,458
and working with machines
and gadgets, constructing.

80
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:43,458
I think of myself
as an atmosphere creator.

81
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:48,491
(sighs)

82
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,693
Okay, um,
I couldn't help but notice

83
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,659
all the tapes have been not
updated to the new format.

84
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,693
No, I'm old-fashioned.

85
00:09:56,825 --> 00:10:00,792
You know the air sticks became
mandatory seven years ago.

86
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,425
I guess I lost track of time.

87
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:06,124
(foreboding synthesizer music)

88
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:09,991
I have to admit there's a lot
more than I was anticipating.

89
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,758
Well, then I better
make us some tea.

90
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:20,425
(sighs)

91
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,258

(fly buzzing)

93
00:10:57,158 --> 00:11:00,491
Just how many tapes
would you say you have?

94
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,124
2,000 or more?

95
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:04,425
(sighs)

96
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,693
Perhaps you could
recommend a motel nearby?

97
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,792
Oh, don't be silly.

98
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:18,659
You'll stay here with me
in Sugarbaby's room.

99
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,258
Oh no, I, I couldn't impose.

100
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:22,792
Oh, I insist.

101
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:26,525
Ma'am, I can't stay
in your home.

102
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:30,458
- I, it's, it's fine...
- It'll be no bother to me or Sugarbaby.

103
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,791
You just make yourself
at home.

104
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:46,191
Well, thank you for being so helpful.
I appreciate it.

105
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:48,791
Of course.
Well, this is gonna be fun.

106
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,058
Come on, Sugarbaby.

107
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:57,258
Let's let the tax man
do his work, heh.

108
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,857
(sighs)

109
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:35,857
Arrived at the home of Arabella
Isadora on September 22nd, 2035.

110
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:39,358
It is now 2:51.

111
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,593
Arabella or Bella as she has
requested I call her has put me

112
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,024
in a spare room
on the second floor.

113
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:49,391
It appears
she has over 2,000 tapes.

114
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:52,693
I will begin
my audit immediately.

00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:36,924
Man:
I'm right here.

123
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,924
I miss you, Dad.

125
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,191

- What are you doing?
- I was watching you work.

140
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,791
You were smiling.

141
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:29,824
Bella, I hate to be rude,
but I prefer to do my work in private.

142
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,159
Of course.
My apologies.

143
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:37,791
Some dinner
for the tax man.

144
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:43,292

Listen to me, Preble.
You don't have much time.

Well, this stuff
is pretty good.

170
00:22:28,258 --> 00:22:31,325
A couple sprays of this

00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:00,092
I'll get it.

181
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:05,625
We're not interested.
Thanks.

182
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,491
Woman:
Can I speak to James Preble?

183
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,791
Buddy: (sighs) Look,
he's not accepting visitors at this time.

184
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:12,158
Woman:
Well, is he here?

185
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,258
Buddy: He's very,
very busy, okay?

186
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:16,158
But I'll be sure
to tell him you stopped by.

187
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,091
Woman: Please,
I really got to speak to him.

188
00:23:18,225 --> 00:23:21,225
Buddy: Look, James has
everything he needs, okay?

189
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,325
If there's anything new
that he needs,

190
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,391
he can just get it from me.

191
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:29,025
(door slam echoes)

192
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,791
(laughs)

193
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:32,059
Who was it?

194
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:34,025
Forgot I ordered us
some chicken.

195
00:23:34,158 --> 00:23:36,858
Extra crispy, double gravy,
just the way you like it.

196
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,358
Mmmm.

197
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:43,491
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm.

198
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,391
(Buddy laughing)

199
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:51,992
- Come on, help me.
- (bottle hissing)

200
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:54,358
(laughing)
Look at them squirm.

201
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:00,425
(machine whirring)

202
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:10,325
(rooster crowing)

203
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:16,858
(hens clucking)

204
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:18,792
(Bella imitating hens clucking)

205
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:53,358
How long have you been
auditing dreams?

206
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,858
I've been with the federal
government for about 15 years now.

207
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:03,491
And...
do you enjoy it?

208
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:08,858
Yes, ma'am.
I do enjoy the work.

209
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:16,124
(brooding synthesizer music)

210
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:19,191
And are you
enjoying my dreams?

211
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:33,991
Waiter: And will anyone
be joining you this evening?

212
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:35,258
No, it'll just be me.

213
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,225
Can I start you
with anything to drink?

214
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:39,991
- Yeah, can I have a glass of wine please?
- Oh, sure thing.

215
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:42,592
Thank you.
And what's your soup of the day?

216
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,358
Today we have
a cream of asparagus.

217
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:46,858
Ooh, that sounds good.

218
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:49,792
Oh, madame,
it is delicious.

219
00:25:49,858 --> 00:25:53,625
Oh. You know, you have a very deep voice.
It's nice.

220
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,225
Oh, thank you,
madame.

221
00:25:55,358 --> 00:25:57,491
No, no, I mean it.
You could be on the radio.

222
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,958
- I've been told that before.
- I bet you can sing.

223
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:03,191
Well, actually,
I play the saxophone.

224
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:08,792
(mysterious saxophone music)

225
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:20,924
(pensive synthesizer music)

226
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:40,792
(bird chirping)

227
00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:43,991
There's a bird in here.

228
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:48,491
Yes, madame. We are working
to remedy the situation.

229
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:49,792
Thank you.

230
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:03,792
Oh, hello, friend.

231
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:08,358
(static)

232
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,358
Our apologies about the bird.

233
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:16,391
Here's some (speaking
gibberish) on the house.

234
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:17,391
Thank you.

235
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:18,391
Waiter:
Yes, of course.

236
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:20,991
(eerie music, buzzing)

237
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:27,325
(customers speaking faintly)

238
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,924
(match striking,
music fades)

239
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:46,325
(faint pensive music)

240
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:58,792
(person whistles)

241
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:01,958
Did you hear that?

242
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,991
It's probably just the pipes.

243
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,024
Do you wanna kiss me?

244
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,626
What?

245
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,857
How do you like the wine?

246
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:26,291
Um, can you excuse me
just for a second?

247
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,491
(water splashing)

248
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,225
(Preble breathing heavily)

249
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:42,024
(stammering) I'm very sorry,
but I should go to bed.

250
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:44,958
- I'm not feeling well.
- Oh, well, you should sit down.

251
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,958
I think I drank
too much wine.

252
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:50,024
Or maybe not enough.

253
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:51,358
No, no.

254
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:54,024
Well, at least
sit with me while I finish.

255
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:58,791
(Preble sighs)

256
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:01,958
(thunder rumbling)

257
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:09,857
Looks like there's gonna
be a storm tonight.

258
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,325
I need to see you again.

259
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:24,626
I think I'm losing my mind.

260
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:26,791
Well, it's about time.

261
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,924
To losing one's mind.

262
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:37,857
There's something
I don't understand.

263
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:39,425
I'm glad to hear that.

264
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,791
There was a bucket
of chicken in your dream,

265
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:44,225
but I couldn't see it.

266
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:47,626
Maybe you couldn't see it because
it wasn't supposed to be there.

267
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:51,425
(somber synthesizer music)

268
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,058
Let me ask you something.

269
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:58,291
Do you believe that your
dreams are your own?

270
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:02,258
Of course.

271
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:04,891
And you don't think
anything should be transmitted

272
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:07,891
in there against your will?

273
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,459
Of course not.

274
00:30:11,824 --> 00:30:13,991
What are you trying to say?

275
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:34,358
Jim and I developed
this together.

276
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:43,492
Once we started wearing this,
the ads disappeared.

277
00:30:44,857 --> 00:30:46,459
What ads?

278
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:51,958
The ads transmitting into our
dreams without us knowing.

279
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:55,158
That doesn't happen.

280
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,258
You of all people should know.

281
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:01,924
Don't you see them in there
when you're doing your work?

282
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:05,658
That's crazy.
Why would they do that?

283
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:09,459
Because it makes them money.

284
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:11,426
(tense synthesizer music)

285
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:37,426
(music stops)

286
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,459
Thank you for dinner.

287
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:11,359
(tense mysterious
synthesizer music)

288
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:14,924
(fly buzzing faintly)

289
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:38,024
Buddy:
Hey buddy, let me in.

290
00:32:42,091 --> 00:32:44,791
Buddy, let me in.

291
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:46,592
(loud knocking)

292
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:47,791
Hey.

293
00:32:49,991 --> 00:32:51,592
Hey, what's going on?

294
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,259
I got a fresh tube here
for you.

295
00:32:53,392 --> 00:32:55,791
Fresh and minty. Sure to keep
your teeth clean all day long.

296
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:59,158
(laughs) Come on, it's me.
I just wanna talk.

297
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,791
She told me.

298
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:05,891
Told you what?

299
00:33:06,024 --> 00:33:08,292
You know she's crazy,
right?

300
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:18,392
You can't keep me out,
James.

301
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:22,791
(discordant synthesizer music)

302
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,991
(loud knocking)

303
00:33:35,924 --> 00:33:38,392
James, I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

304
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:40,891
Hey, have a cold one.

305
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:42,592
(loud whirring,
Buddy groans)

306
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,558
James, don't do it.

307
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:45,891
You know she's just gonna...

308
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:50,824
(static buzzing,
speech distorted)

309
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:01,857
(mysterious synthesizer music)

310
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,158
Hi, Preble.

311
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:14,292
Man:
Who's that? (echoing)

312
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:27,791
(thunder rumbling)

313
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:30,891
(rain falling)

314
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:41,091
(pensive synthesizer music,
thunder rumbling)

315
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,259
(thunder rumbling)

316
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:41,159
(fire crackling)

317
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:48,958
(thunder rumbling faintly)

318
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:52,857
Does anybody else know?

319
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:56,192
I'm not sure.

320
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,791
What am I supposed
to do with this?

321
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:08,125
That's up to you.

322
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:14,259
Well, then why did you
bring me here?

323
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:19,824
I wanted someone
to share my dreams with.

324
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:32,159
I want you
to look at this.

325
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:39,125
You and I are more
connected than you know.

326
00:36:47,558 --> 00:36:51,192
(thunder rumbling faintly)

327
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:56,991
(rain falling)

328
00:37:15,325 --> 00:37:16,791
Morning, Bella.

329
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:22,791
Bella?

330
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,358
(low somber synthesizer music)

331
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:29,291
Bella?

332
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,692
Bella.

333
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:36,958
Bella!

334
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,358
I don't know,
she seemed... good.

335
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:59,458
(speaking faintly)

336
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:02,091
I used to make
them for my son,

337
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,458
but he was never interested.

338
00:40:04,592 --> 00:40:06,291
You have a son?

339
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:10,425
Yes.

340
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,059
We don't see
much of each other.

341
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,791
Oh yeah?
Why is that?

342
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:22,892
We don't see
eye to eye.

343
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:27,925
I was very young
when Peter was born.

344
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:32,992
His father and I
went to school together.

345
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:35,858
He was much older.

346
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,892
(sighs)

347
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:41,858
(suspenseful synthesizer music)

348
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:49,358
He was an evil man.

349
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:53,391
And unfortunately,
Peter took after him in that regard.

350
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:59,225
If I could go back...

351
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:01,858
I would do
things differently.

352
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,425
But that's life.

353
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:10,625
What was your
second husband like?

354
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:13,291
He was a dream.

355
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:15,825
We had a wonderful life
together.

356
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:19,792
(soft nostalgic
synthesizer music)

357
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:22,825
(doorbell chiming)

358
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,625
- Peter: You must be James Preble.
- Yes.

359
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:36,358
Peter Bloom.
Bella was my mother.

360
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:37,991
Ah yes. Hello.

361
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,091
Terrible thing to lose your mother.
Very sad.

362
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,358
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

363
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:53,191
She was rather old,
so I guess it wasn't terribly surprising.

364
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:57,091
- She was a lovely woman.
- Yeah, she was. Listen, James.

365
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:01,358
I'd like to have a few words with
you about the last couple of days.

366
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:03,692
To be honest
I think her mind was slipping

367
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:07,458
these past few years,
or since Jim died.

368
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:10,991
I hope she didn't fill your
head with any of her nonsense.

369
00:42:12,258 --> 00:42:16,124
You understand she was
totally delusional?

370
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:19,925
I wasn't aware.

371
00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:24,124
Listen, my wife and son
are arriving this afternoon.

372
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:26,158
Why don't we all
have dinner here tonight

373
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:29,924
and we can all talk
and send you on your way.

374
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:32,525
Okay.
That sounds fine.

375
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:33,558
Great.

376
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:35,892
(somber synthesizer music)

377
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:57,391
(music stops)

378
00:43:24,924 --> 00:43:28,924
(nostalgic synthesizer music)

379
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:53,693
Grass Man: I've loved you in
many lifetimes, in many forms...

380
00:43:53,825 --> 00:43:57,091
in many places
through many storms.

381
00:43:57,225 --> 00:44:00,491
In the desert,
lost at sea,

382
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:03,158
with little hope
to comfort me.

383
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,659
But there you were,
all alone,

384
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,291
arm in arm,
we made it home.

385
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,824
(music swells)

386
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:49,024
(music ends,
loud knocking)

387
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:52,857
There you are.
Come on down for dinner.

388
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:16,091
This is my son,
Brian.

389
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,225
Chicken?

390
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:25,924
Here's Martha.

391
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:36,425
Martha, dear,
why don't you take Brian

392
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,824
and start going through
Mother's belongings?

393
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:40,824
(Martha snickers)

394
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:48,991
So did my mother
ever mention me?

395
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:51,358
(somber pulsating
synthesizer music)

396
00:45:51,492 --> 00:45:52,291
Um...

397
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,258
just, just once,
briefly.

398
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:59,291
But I didn't ask her
about her personal life.

399
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,425
I'm just here
doing my job.

400
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,358
You find anything
interesting on the tapes?

401
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:07,459
She had a very vivid
imagination.

402
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:09,559
(laughs)
Indeed she did.

403
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:12,358
So listen, I'm curious
if you don't mind my asking.

404
00:46:12,492 --> 00:46:17,459
What is the protocol
on cases of this nature?

405
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:26,091
Well, it can be tricky
when someone passes mid-audit.

406
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:28,459
I personally deal
with the living

407
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:33,791
so there will be a specialized unit
who comes in and takes over the case.

408
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,091
So your work is complete?

409
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:38,225
Well, my, my work
is complete,

410
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:41,124
but the audit
will be finished.

411
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:55,091
You understand
why someone in my position

412
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:57,593
needs to make sure
that his family is protected

413
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,426
from unwanted attention?

414
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:08,958
If you'll excuse me,
I should finish packing.

415
00:47:15,692 --> 00:47:18,492
- What are you doing?
- Peter: All of these belong to us now.

416
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:20,891
They're still
part of the audit.

417
00:47:27,225 --> 00:47:28,526
What's wrong
with you people?

418
00:47:28,658 --> 00:47:30,058
Hey, bub.

419
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:34,492
My mother's dead.

420
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,091
The audit is over.

421
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:39,325
No, you'll have to square
that away with the Bureau,

422
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:41,692
but just so you know,
you and your family

423
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:45,225
have just committed a federal crime and
I'll have no choice but to report it.

424
00:48:00,024 --> 00:48:04,024
(nostalgic synthesizer music)

425
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:06,958
(music stops,
machine thuds)

426
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:17,225
(dramatic unsettling
synthesizer music)

427
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:27,958
Peter:
<i>Hey, bub, bub, bub.</i>

428
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,791
(echoing)
<i>My mother is dead.</i>

429
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:33,158
(echoing)
<i>This is over.</i>

430
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:34,958
<i>(distorted voices
speaking faintly)</i>

431
00:49:35,091 --> 00:49:36,692
Peter:
<i>Nonsense.</i>

432
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:41,592
<i>Listen, my son and wife
are arriving this afternoon.</i>

433
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:44,158
<i>Why don't we all
have dinner here tonight?</i>

434
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:46,592
(head squelches)

435
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:48,158
(Martha cackling)

436
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:50,024
<i>Why don't we all
have dinner here tonight</i>

437
00:49:50,158 --> 00:49:54,791
<i>and then we can all talk
and send you on your way.</i>

438
00:49:59,924 --> 00:50:02,024
<i>(loud whooshing)</i>

439
00:50:02,158 --> 00:50:06,158
(unsettling discordant music)

440
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:29,158
(high-pitched
discordant string music)

441
00:50:45,426 --> 00:50:46,924
Uh, excuse me, Peter?

442
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:50,857
Uh...

443
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:52,891
You've been a bad boy.

444
00:50:53,024 --> 00:50:55,558
(audio crackling)

445
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:57,192
(howling)

446
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:04,791
(music lowers in intensity)

447
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,891
Excuse me,
I've been a bad boy.

448
00:51:20,058 --> 00:51:22,891
(music swells)

449
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:24,958
(music stops)

450
00:51:25,091 --> 00:51:28,692
Death to all bad boys.

451
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:32,958
(loud suspenseful music)

452
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:36,491
You should watch
where you're going,

453
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:39,791
you dumb donkey boy.

454
00:51:39,857 --> 00:51:41,391
I'm lost.
My head hurts.

455
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:43,359
(howling)

456
00:51:44,592 --> 00:51:47,791
Death to all bad boys.

457
00:51:47,924 --> 00:51:52,525
Martha And Brian:
Death to all bad boys.

458
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:55,625
Death to all bad boys.

459
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:59,791
Death to all bad boys.

460
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:03,125
Bella?

461
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,358
Brian:
Death to all bad boys.

462
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,791
Brian And Martha:
Death to all bad boys.

463
00:52:10,891 --> 00:52:12,491
- I'm in trouble.
- I know.

464
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:15,558
Look, first thing's first,
I have to get you out of this closet.

465
00:52:15,692 --> 00:52:19,159
- Well, how are you gonna do that?
- We're gonna swim.

466
00:52:20,525 --> 00:52:23,292
(Brian sniffing)

467
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:29,958
(laughs)
Hey, Dad, he's in here.

468
00:52:30,092 --> 00:52:32,692
- How are we gonna swim?
- Hold your breath.

469

00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,924
(banging)

471
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:46,924
Now I'm angry.

472
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:51,092
- Open this fucking door!
- (banging)

473
00:52:51,226 --> 00:52:52,226
(snarling)

474
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:53,192
One...

475
00:52:54,525 --> 00:52:55,325
two...

477
00:52:56,857 --> 00:52:57,891
three.

479
00:53:08,092 --> 00:53:11,291

482
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:35,658
Preble, it's okay,
it's okay.

483
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:38,325
- Bella?
- Hi, Preble.

484
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:05,924
(inspirational
synthesizer music)

485
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:21,258
This island became our home.

486
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:25,125
We had everything we needed.

487
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:28,959
<i>Fresh coconut water to drink.</i>

488
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:31,125
<i>Vegetables from
underneath the sand.</i>

489
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:36,325
<i>And all the fish
you could ever eat.</i>

490
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,491
(Bella laughing)

491
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:43,425
<i>We invented games
with seashells and pebbles</i>

492
00:54:43,558 --> 00:54:45,325
<i>and pieces of driftwood.</i>

493
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:46,358
Oh.

494
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,857
(Bella laughs)

495
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:51,391
<i>And wrote novels
in the sand.</i>

496
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:55,658
(dolphin chirping)

497
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,225
<i>For every dolphin in the water,

<i>Anything was possible

499
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,959
<i>One morning Bella
turned me into a balloon</i>

500
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:17,391
<i>and I floated high

00:55:26,891 --> 00:55:29,791
<i>Some days we were joined
by an old friend.</i>

502
00:55:29,857 --> 00:55:32,959
<i>Played us some of the smoothest
tunes we'd ever heard.</i>

503
00:55:35,158 --> 00:55:37,992
<i>We danced until
we couldn't dance anymore.</i>

504
00:55:42,158 --> 00:55:44,059
<i>We fell in love.</i>

505
00:55:47,525 --> 00:55:50,791
<i>And one night
we turned into beets...</i>

506
00:55:50,892 --> 00:55:54,124
<i>and had a front row seat to the
first dinner we ever shared.</i>

507
00:55:55,092 --> 00:55:58,325
To our house guest,
Mr. Preble.

(Preble whistles)

509
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:02,992
Did you hear that?

510
00:56:07,225 --> 00:56:10,791
Preble: <i>Days stretched out in front
of us like diamonds on a necklace.</i>

511
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:22,959
I don't feel so good.

512
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:25,091
(gasps)
You're bleeding.

- <i>(static)</i>
- <i>Fast acting double strength.</i>

514
00:56:33,325 --> 00:56:34,925
These puppies will
take away the pain.

- <i>Take away the pain.</i>
- <i>(static screeching)</i>

516
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:38,692
Preble, there's something
I have to tell you.

517
00:56:38,824 --> 00:56:39,791
What?

518
00:56:39,892 --> 00:56:41,592
They're trying to kill you.

519
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:44,391
Come on, we have to go.

520
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:48,124
- Wait, why are they trying to kill me?
- Because of what you know.

521
00:56:48,258 --> 00:56:51,458
- What do I know?
- You know about the ads.

522
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:56,124
- Do you know who my son is?
- No, who is he?

523
00:56:56,258 --> 00:56:58,058
Guavatron industries
is the largest ad agency

524
00:56:58,191 --> 00:57:01,058
in the whole country
and my son's their CEO.

525
00:57:01,191 --> 00:57:02,791
<i>Spider Death,
three times more deadly</i>

526
00:57:02,892 --> 00:57:04,058
<i>than the other leading brands.</i>

527
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:06,191
Don't look at that.
Come on.

528
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:10,191
Do you know how they became the
biggest ad agency in the country?

529
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:13,091
- No, how?
- Because they put ads in our dreams.

530
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:15,091
- How do you know all this?
- <i>Red Rocket soda, one sip...</i>

531
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:17,625
Because the experiments,
the rats.

532
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:18,992
Come on Preble,

want until I give it to you!

01:19:09,425 --> 01:19:12,291
(static crackling)

714
01:19:15,857 --> 01:19:19,358
(bright synthesizer music)

715
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:26,024
Preble: <i>And then suddenly
everyone I knew was there.</i>

716
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:30,358
<i>And they were all cheering.</i>

717
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:34,791
<i>Cheering for us.</i>

718
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,891
<i>But something was wrong.</i>

719
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:02,158
- Peter: Hello, mother.
- Peter.

720
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:05,559
I'm so sorry
about everything.

721
01:20:05,692 --> 01:20:10,124
I love you so,
so, so much.

722
01:20:12,426 --> 01:20:14,158
Preble:
<i>He shouldn't be here.</i>

723
01:20:16,757 --> 01:20:18,593
Hello, Preble.

724
01:20:18,724 --> 01:20:19,891
It's time you go home.

725
01:20:22,593 --> 01:20:25,891
Step right up.
The ride's about to begin.

726
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:31,958
Ha ha!

727
01:20:36,593 --> 01:20:39,459
Preble: <i>But everyone
was smiling and happy.</i>

728
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:44,824
<i>Maybe people change.</i>

729
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,924
<i>Maybe things change.</i>

730
01:21:23,824 --> 01:21:26,359
(snarls)

731
01:21:31,857 --> 01:21:32,991
Preble:
What's happening?

732
01:21:33,857 --> 01:21:35,392
We're separating.

733
01:21:36,824 --> 01:21:38,058
He tricked us!

734
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:41,225
We're disintegrating!

735
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:43,791
Bella:
No, I don't believe that.

736
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,857
Preble:
I can feel the fire.

737
01:21:46,824 --> 01:21:48,492
It's overtaking me.

738
01:21:51,459 --> 01:21:54,924
Fight it, Preble.
You can fight it.

739
01:21:57,857 --> 01:21:59,791
I can't stop it.

740
01:22:07,824 --> 01:22:09,091
Goodbye, Bella.

741
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,791
I'm melting.

742
01:22:11,924 --> 01:22:14,791
Melting, that's it.

743
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:17,658
The ice cream cone.

744
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:21,791
Ice cream cone?
What ice cream cone?

745
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:26,191
(grunts)

746
01:22:28,525 --> 01:22:30,459
(screaming)

747
01:22:33,326 --> 01:22:36,191
(nostalgic synthesizer music)

748
01:22:56,558 --> 01:22:59,058
(gasps, coughing)

749
01:23:11,558 --> 01:23:14,292
(breathing heavily)

750
01:23:20,824 --> 01:23:23,326
(pensive synthesizer music)

751
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:28,226
(dramatic music)

752
01:24:53,658 --> 01:24:55,824
(music fades)

753
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,425
(static)

754
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:46,159
(gentle nostalgic music)

755
01:25:56,058 --> 01:25:57,325
I like your song.

756
01:25:58,824 --> 01:26:00,259
Thank you.

757
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,391
Would you like
to go for a walk?

758
01:26:06,325 --> 01:26:07,192
Okay.

759
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:40,226
Grass Man: I've loved
you in many lifetimes,

760
01:26:41,358 --> 01:26:43,025
in many forms,

761
01:26:44,791 --> 01:26:48,958
in many places
through many storms.

762
01:26:49,092 --> 01:26:51,425
In the desert,
lost at sea,

763
01:26:51,558 --> 01:26:55,192
with little hope
to comfort me.

764
01:26:55,325 --> 01:26:58,125
But there you were,
all alone.

765
01:26:58,258 --> 01:27:00,857
Arm in arm
we made it home.
