[slow music]

2
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:03,827
- [Lawyer] Your honor,
this news comes as a shock

3
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:05,172
and surprise.

4
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:09,482
[slow tragic music]

00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:13,034
[lawyers talking quietly]

6
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:51,034
- I am very disappointed.

7
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:54,724
Counselors proceed
in your seats please.

00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:04,862
This morning, a prison van
traveling from Huntsville

10
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:09,931
to Austin was exploded at a
truck stop near Roane's Prairie.

11
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:12,137
[audience gasps]

12
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,931
Two deputy sheriffs and Mr.
Delbert McKitrick were killed.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,379
The cause of the
explosion is unknown,

14
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:20,275
no suspects have
been apprehended.

15
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,724
Since Mr. McKitrick was the
prosecution's chief witness,

16
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:30,275
the state has no choice but
to withdraw all seven charges

17
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:32,310
of murder against the defendant.

18
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:33,931

[Lawyer slams table]

20
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,931
It is with the deepest and
the most profound regret,

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,724
Mr. Slate that I am
obligated to set you free.

22
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:43,310
Now get your despicable
butt out of here.

23
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,413
[gavel slams]

24
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:46,655
[crowd exclaims]

25
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:48,862
- [screams] You
killed my daughter,

26
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,275
I want you dead, dead, dead!

27
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:55,586
- Order in this
court! [gavel slams]

28
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:57,586
Order in this court,
bailiff, remove this man!

29

[people clamor]
[man hollers]

30
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:03,068
Get that man out of here!

31
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:11,137

[Jack hums]

36
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:31,206
- [Rip] The coffee's
thick as 40 weight oil,

37
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:32,793
tastes like it to.

38
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:36,931
- Here look out.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,206
- You know I don't
eat breakfast.

40
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,517
- Now listen to me, son,
breakfast is the cornerstone

41
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:43,655
of a man's day, that's
what Mama always said.

42
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:45,103
- You ain't my mama, Jack.

43
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:47,965
- I wouldn't take the job if
they served dinner afterwards

44
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,896
but someone's got
to worry about you

45
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:54,241
because you have been abandoned
by every woman in your life.

46
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,862
- Abandoned.
- That's right, abandoned.

47
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,965
Jewel's gone to L.A.

48
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,448
- With my blessings.

49
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:01,655
- Well, Debbie's
run off to El Paso.

50
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,344
- For college, kids
leave home, Jack.

51
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:07,310
- Well, Rose ain't kin,
she's the finest woman

52
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,275
you'll ever know and she's
up and gone to Del Rio,

53
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:11,793
what the hell's in Del Rio?

54
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:13,206
- Her daddy needs her.

55
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,482
- He ain't the only
one who needs her.

56
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,689
- Family's important.

57
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:18,517
- Ain't nothing more.

58
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:21,000
That's exactly why
I'm bunking here.

59
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,689
I'm just trying to help fill
up some of the empty spots

60
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,034
in your life.

61
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:29,689
- Free room and board don't
hurt nothing, does it?

62
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,413
[Jack chuckles]

63
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:33,689
- That just ain't right.

64
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:36,344
- I was just kidding, Jack.

65
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:38,137
- No, I'm talking about this.

66
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:41,758
Everybody knows that
Slate had McKitrick killed

67
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,310
so he wouldn't testify.

68
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,206
Now Slate's out free as air.

69
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,379
- It's a sad story.

70
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:49,448
- It's a story that
wouldn't have been

71
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:50,896
written 100 years ago.

72
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,689
Justice would have been served.

73
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:55,034
- Yeah, well things change.

74
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:58,482
- That's because too
many people are afraid

75
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:01,000
to stand up for what's right.

76
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,793
Thank god, there's some
of us who ain't afraid

77
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:06,137
and never will be.

78
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,965
[powerful music]

79
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,724
You want some more potatoes?

80
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:14,827
- [Colonel] Just drive over

81
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,620
to Hoffner campaign
headquarters, they're

82
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:21,310
- Hell, Colonel, I hate
politicians worse than taxes.

83
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:25,034
- [Colonel] So do I, rip but
Hoffner's making a big stink.

84
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:27,310
He claims he's had
threats against his life.

85
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:30,310
- [Rip] That comes with the
territory in politics, don't it?

86
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,965
- [Colonel] That's
true enough but Chief,

87
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,965
Vernan asked us to lend a hand

88
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:35,827
while Hoffner's
campaigning in Austin,

89
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,862
it makes him feel safe.

90
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,068
He could be governor
and we're gonna have to

91
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,758
take him seriously.

92
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,413
- [Announcer] Vote
for Bud Hoffner,

93
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,896
Texas can ride tall
in the saddle again.

94
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:50,655
Vote for Bud Hoffner in
the capital as governor.

95
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,793
He'll stop the rising crime rate

96
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:55,068
and he'll turn on
his [indistinct]

97
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:58,758
and then the [indistinct].

98
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:03,413
[engine revs]

99
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:18,275
- My friends and fellow Texans,
it's been four years now,

100
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:20,724
the governor's been sitting
out there in the capital-

101
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,172
- Excuse me Mr. Hoffner.
- What do you want!

102
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,862
Can't you see I'm rehearsing.

103
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,689
Get that away from me.

104
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:29,137
[Ben whispers to himself]

105
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:30,586
[Ben clears throat]

106
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:32,344
My friends and fellow Texans.

107
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:33,241
- Pardon me sir.

108
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,000
- Not now you idiot!

109
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:41,310
My friends and fellow Texans,
it's been four years now,

110
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,827
the governor's been, not
while I'm rehearsing dialogue.

111
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:46,482
- [Director] Hoffner, we're
ready for you on camera now,

112
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,896
ready for you please.

113
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:51,137
- All right, all
right, don't push me.

114
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:54,620
- [Staff] Okay, here
he comes, stepping in.

115
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,517
- Who's the idiot that
go the 16 hand horse?

116
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:58,103
That's all I need.

117
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,068
- [Director] All right,
we're ready to roll, please,

118
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:08,655
get ready to slate.

119
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:11,896
We have speed now and slate it.

120
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,034
Ready please and action.

121
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:17,517

It's been four years
now the governor's

123
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,206
been sitting up there-

124
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,517
- [Man] What will we do
with the horse, John-

125
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:23,586
- [Director] That's all right,
it happens all the time.

126
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:24,586
Here we go.

127
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,758
- My friends and fellow Texans,

128
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,068
it's been four years now, the
governor's been sitting up

129
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:33,000
there in the capital.
- This is not a commercial

130
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,827
about a microphone!

131
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:41,655
Here we go.

132
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:44,379

133
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:45,931
it's been four years now,

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,586
the governor's been
sitting up there

135
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,931
in the capital in his
big [stutters] office.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,275
- [Director] Stop, stop, stop,

137
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,241
that's all right, Mr. Hoffner,
it happens, it happens

138
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,793
to the best of them.

139

[ominous music]

140
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:58,275
- This is Rip, Colonel,
you remember a hired gun

141
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:00,655
from Tyler named Danny Schmits?

142
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:03,793
Wasn't he doing time in
Huntsville for attempted murder?

143
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:05,448
- [Colonel] Was, they
cut him loose in October,

144
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:08,172
time off for good behavior, why?

145
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:13,517
- Well, he just showed up,
I'm gonna go have a look.

146

[ominous music]

147

governor's been sitting up there

148
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:38,517
in the capital in his
big office behind his-

149
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,551
- [Director] Okay,
ready for another take,

150
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,758
now can we please have
it quiet on the set?

151
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:47,172
[gun fires]

00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,379
[people holler]

153
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:49,517
- [Man] He's got a gun!

[people holler]

155
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:54,620
- [Director] I can't
shoot like this,

156
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,448
now quiet on the set!

157
00:07:58,482 --> 00:07:59,931
All right, action.

158
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:03,931
[ominous music]

159
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,724
- Well, now that things
are under control,

160
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:10,862
only if it ain't the cavalry,
how are you doing, Captain?

161
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,310
- What the hell
are you doing here?

162
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,206
- Lying and by god cheating.

163
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:15,758
- We've been playing
dominoes four days running

164
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,448
and he ain't lost but two times.

165
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:18,586
- Now that ain't luck
and that ain't skill,

166
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,793
that's yellow dog cheating.

167
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:22,517
- And that's a damn
lie and you know it.

168
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,275
You all are just bad
losers, I'm a good winner.

169
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:26,862
They even brought the
National Guard in here

170
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,241
to steal my money.

171
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,551
- They're here because
we got a belly full

172
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,724
of this sidewinder.
- Cheating us blind!

173
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:36,413
- I wouldn't do nothing
like that, Captain,

174
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:41,413
I'm a man of integrity and
certain spiritual inclinations.

175
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:42,896
- Spiritual my butt.

176
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:44,206
- Check his inside pockets.

177
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,896
- Why he even stole my
diamond-studded money clip.

178
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:47,172
- Oh, horseshoes.

179
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:51,000
- Let's have a look at
that belt buckle, Ace.

180
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,000
- I'm really disappointed
in you, Captain,

181
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:06,793
I thought we were a
little closer than that.

182
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:11,758
- Okay, boys game's over,
get out of here, go home.

183
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:13,275
- What about our money?
- My money, you're both wrong,

184
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,241
it's evidence.

185
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,000
Not so fast, Rodriguez.

186
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:20,034
Last time around, I told you
I never wanted to see you

187
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,482
in Texas again.

188
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:22,655
- Hmm-mm.

189
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,137
- Well, why am I seeing you?

190
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:26,068
- Because these gentlemen
over here brought me

191
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:27,379
all the way up from Mexico

192
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:28,793
to teach them how
to play dominoes.

193
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:31,620
As a true son of Texas,
how could I refuse?

194
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,000
- Just say no.

195
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:34,000
- Next time I will.

196
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,689
- Too late.

197
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:37,137
- You gonna arrest me
for playing dominoes?

198
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:39,241
- Well, what the hell am
I supposed to do with you?

199
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,965
You're an escaped felon.

200
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:42,206
- Oh, you cleared me
of all that stuff.

201
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:44,034
- And you lied to me.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,517
- [Man] You have been selected
to uphold the tradition

203
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:57,931
begun 150 years ago
in this great state.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,310
Then as now the legal
system failed the people

205
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:05,448
and the people joined together
to uphold law and order

206
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:08,482
to ensure justice was done.

207
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:12,689
What rough beast, it's
hour come round at last,

208
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:16,206
slouches towards
Bethlehem to be born.

209
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:20,965
The beast is alive again and
we must stop its progress.

210
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:23,896
Do you accept this
responsibility?

211
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:27,517
- I do.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,310
- [Man] This body has found
Richard Slate guilty of murder

213
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:35,000
and has sentenced him to death.

214
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,896
[patriotic music]

215
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:43,896
- [Announcer] Now
back to Mister Radio,

216
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:45,586
the Stanley Aldridge Show.

217
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:46,862
- [Man] Speaking of
old Sug Campbell,

218
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:48,482
when I was visiting yesterday

219
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:50,620
with a favorite football coach,

220
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,448
Sug came from one
of [indistinct].

221
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:57,310
So, Sug tells me he's got
a bunch of young players

222
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,482
coming up size 15 feet,
shoulders about the size

223
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,172
of your motorcycle.

224
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,965
God, I hope they can just
read numbers good enough

225
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,379
to find their locker,
just kidding Sug.

226
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:10,034
But hey, if you need a
helmet for one of them boys-

227
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,551
[rain pours]

228
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,275
And in other
political news today

229
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:35,620
both candidates for governor
were in the capital city

230
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:37,000
looking for votes.

231
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,758
Gary Bud Hoffner told the-

232
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:41,517
[ominous music]

233
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:43,517
- Hi.

234
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:50,206
Life's sweet as new corn
when you're living ain't it?

235
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,068
- What the hell
are you doing here?

236
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:55,586
- I'm the angel Gabriel, there's
gonna be a new face in hell

237
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:56,758
in about a second here

238
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:59,068
and you ain't gonna
be happy about it.

239
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:02,034
[sirens blare]

240
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:04,448
[gun fires]

241
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:09,034
[gun fires]

242
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:10,965
[policeman grunts]

243
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,862
- Stay down!
- Get down.

244
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:13,965
- Come on get in the back!

245
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,551
You two get in the house!

246
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,034
- All right, I'm going in!

247
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,137
Stop!
[gun fires]

248
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,172
[gun fires]

249
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,413
- It ain't right taking
me to Fort Worth,

250
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,965
I thought we was friends,
I stayed at your house,

251
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:29,206
I know your kids, I thought
I was part of the family.

252
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,793
[phone rings]

253
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:34,344
- Ranger unit six.
- Stand by for Boone.

254
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:38,344
- [Man] Rip, we've got
a problem, a big one,

255
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:41,068
a shootout at the Dinemark
cottages in Mancheck,

256
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:44,000
a ranger's involved,
Jack Parsons.

257
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:46,241
- Has he been shot?

258
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,551
- [Man] The report I got says
he's been doing the shooting.

259
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,068
One dead, one wounded,
you get on over there.

260
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,586
- [Policeman] Take her away.

261
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
[ambulance sirens blare]

262
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,655
[people chattering]

263
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:18,517
- You know I don't recall
asking for anymore rangers.

264
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,206
- I don't recall
needing an invitation.

265
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:21,862
- Is that right?

266
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,413
Well, I don't need
the aggravation.

267
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:25,379
I've already got one
dead and another deputy

268
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:27,551
with a bullet hole in his lung,

269
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,655
both compliments
of Jack Parsons.

270
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,206
- Who's the body?

271
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,931
- Richard Slate, been
free about 48 hours

272
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,310
before Parson's found
him and put a bullet hole

273
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,551
in the back of his head.

274
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,793
Is that frontier
justice ranger style?

275
00:13:43,862 --> 00:13:45,310
- There ain't been a ranger born

276
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,689
that'd shoot a man from behind.

277
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:51,655
- I saw Parson's run out, there
wasn't anyone else in there.

278
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,034
- You see him pull the trigger?

279
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:54,551
- I heard the shot close enough.

280
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,655
- This ain't horseshoes.

281
00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:59,586
- Captain, this is a nice,
clean hole going in there,

282
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,448
looks like a nine
millimeter to me.

283
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:02,793
- Who the hell are you?

284
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,344
- Technical consultant, sir.

285
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:07,551
- Nine millimeter,
Parson's wore a 45

286
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,931
and his rifle's been
hanging on the wall

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,413
since his eyes blurred.

288
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,172
- Let me tell you fellas
something, I don't care

289
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:16,862
what he was carrying or
where his rifle was hung,

290
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,448
I saw him, I'm gonna find him.

291
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:23,689
- All right, let's
go, excuse me.

292
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,758
- Where's your cuffs?

293
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:39,793
- I got sensitive skin,
Captain, I really do,

294
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,827
but I love the scene of
the crime, don't you?

295
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:43,068
That's Ricky Slate over there,

296
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:44,793
spent some time
together in Huntsville.

297
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,275
Why are you taking
me back to Hanson?

298
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,586
You're gonna hate
yourself when you do.

299
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,965
Can we talk?

300
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:52,413
- Talking's exactly the
last chance you've got, Ace.

301
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,586
You tell me everything
you know about Slate,

302
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:57,517
I might not turn
you over to Hanson.

303
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,724
Might even give you back
some of your domino winnings.

304
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:04,068
You try to run, even a
step, I'll shoot you myself.

305
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,551
- He was born in
Falfurrias, Texas, 1957, 58,

306
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,793
I believe it was.

307
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:11,034
We spent a lot of time
together in prison,

308
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,310
got to know him
pretty well, you know.

309
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,241
I think he was a
Capricorn, I'm not sure,

310
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,758
but I'm sure I have it
written down somewhere

311
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,172
and I'll be glad to
look it up for you

312
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,344
as quick as we get somewhere.

313
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:38,310
[intriguing music]

314
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:01,241
Boy, this is a big old empty
house without the girls,

315
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,344
I bet you get lonesome.

316
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:05,758
- There's worse things
than being alone.

317
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:09,241
- True story, have to put
up with a lot of small talk,

318
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,620
people in your ear are
all the time bugging you.

319
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:13,000
Bothers me worse than anything,

320
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,689
somebody right up in
your face when you-

321
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:18,482
I've heard too, though
that man's made bigger

322
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,689
by a positive female presence,
have you ever heard that?

323
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:24,275
- Dr. Ruth, give it a rest.

324
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:26,344
- The press is gonna have
a field day when they hear

325
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:28,896
about that Slate story,
also I can see it now,

326
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:32,620
accused murderer shot dead by
revenge-crazed Texas Ranger.

327
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,068
I knew that guy was a
psycho the minute I saw him.

328
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,965
He's loonier than
a coyote in heat.

329
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,689
- Jack Parsons ain't crazy.

330
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:41,586
- He's wily, too, he offed
that guy with a nine millimeter

331
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:42,827
just to cover his tracks.

332
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,206
- He didn't kill anyone.

333
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:45,896
- [Rodriguez] Captain, the
sheriff saw him coming out

334
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:47,551
of the building, you
think he was just

335
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,862
passing through the area?

336
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:50,827
- Listen, if I want anymore
crap out of you today,

337
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:51,931
I'll squeeze your head.

338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,068
- Excuse me, I knocked
at the front door

339
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:57,068
but there wasn't an answer,
so I came around back.

340
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:58,931
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm Susan Davis.

342
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:02,655
- Oh, hi, I'm Billy Roy
Barker, nice to meet you.

343
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:05,620
This is Captain
Elvin Cecil Metcalf,

344
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:07,724
the gentleman that just
said he's gonna kill me.

345
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,379
- Captain Metcalf, I'm with
the FBI, Boston office,

346
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,172
temporarily assigned
to San Antonio

347
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,482
to handle the Slate case.

348
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:18,551
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about Jack Parsons

349
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,551
if I could.

350
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:28,448
I happen to understand that
you and Parsons are friends.

351
00:17:28,517 --> 00:17:29,724
- You do, huh?

352
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:38,379
- Captain, everyone is convinced
that Parsons killed Slate.

353
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,655
The police, the
papers, my colleagues.

354
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,896
Now based on what we
have, I'm not convinced

355
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:44,689
that he did or didn't.

356
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:48,068
I'm just looking for
the truth, that's all.

357
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:49,724
- The truth is he
didn't kill Slate.

358
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:51,137
- Then maybe he knows who did

359
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:54,206
and if so he could be in
great danger out there.

360
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:57,862
We can offer government
protection for him.

361
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:04,344
Look, you want what's
right and so do I.

362
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,344
- It takes him
awhile to warm up.

363
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:33,275
- I'll tell you
one thing, Captain,

364
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:34,551
getting busted by
a cop like that

365
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,379
could be a spiritual experience.

366
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,068
- I ain't planning
on getting busted.

367
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:40,793
- Well, I wouldn't be too hasty.

368
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:43,724
A little of that might
take some of the thorns

369
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,379
out of your cactus.

370
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:20,172
- Rooms are eight dollars
a night, sheets 50 cents,

371
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,448
towels a quarter.

372
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:26,655
You make your own bed
and no women on Sunday.

373
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:29,103
- Don't need a room, I'm
looking for Jack Parsons.

374
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:30,448
- No Parsons here, you might

375
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:35,551
check the Metropolitan
Baptist Church. [man laughs]

376
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:40,551
- Mother of grace, is that
safe a Harin Hall, Marvin.

377
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,896
- Nothing less.

378
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,206
- Built in Dallas, about 65.

379
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:47,034
- Close, but no cupid
doll, built in 64.

380
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,206
Once held a fortune
in Confederate gold.

381
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:53,172
- You mind if I
take a closer look.

382
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,793
- Feast your eyes, son.

383
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,689
She's a grand old baby.

384
00:19:57,758 --> 00:20:00,034
Got a triple lot serial number.

385
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:00,965
- No.
- Fact.

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,689
- Hey wait a minute.

387
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:10,137
Now hold on, you
can't go up there.

388
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,827
Are you hard of hearing?

389
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,689
[dramatic music]

390
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:20,068
[Rip knocks]

391
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,310
- Jack, it's Rip, open up.

392
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,827
What the hell are
you doing here?

393
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:26,034
- Parson's is in
there, isn't he?

394
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:28,896
Captain Parson,
Susan Davis, FBI.

395
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:33,586
[gun fires]
[woman screams]

396
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:36,413
[dramatic music]

397
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,827
[car engine starts]

398
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,482
[tires squeal]

399
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,551
A foot or two lower
and we'd all be dead.

400
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,827
- That was warning.
- A warning,

401
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,103
you're his friend.

402
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,517
- But you ain't.

403
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,241
- You said he was
living with you,

404
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,379
why would he be keeping a
room here, friends, family,

405
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,620
maybe a woman?

406
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,965
- Not likely, Jack
ain't the social type.

407
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:26,068
He's only got two friends,
Rip and Jack Daniels.

408
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,551
- Nobody asked you, prisoner.

409
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:31,724
- You're a prisoner?

410
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:35,206
- Only of life's
little whimsies, the

411
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:37,448
and my own foolish heart.

412
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:38,965
- God knows what he's up to.

413
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:43,172
- Hold it, there's one
little stone left unturned.

414
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:47,448
- Can't open the safe, it's
against company policy.

415
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:51,862
- I'm company policy.
- And I'm with the FBI.

416
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:55,241
- I wouldn't open that safe
for the ghost of Elvis.

417
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,724
And you two ain't even close.

418
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:08,482
- Just relax, darling, I'll
be real slow and gentle.

419
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:14,448
- What are you, Jesse James?

420
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:17,137
- Don't talk to a man
while he's making love.

421
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:19,000
- You'd have better luck finding
a virgin in a whore house

422
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:21,344
than getting into
her. [man laughs]

423
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,793
[Billy laughs]
[man laughs]

424
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:26,862
- It's not luck, it's skill.

425
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:30,275
[dramatic fiddle music]

426
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:48,448
- You can't take that evidence,
this is a federal case,

427
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:52,413
the FBI has jurisdiction here.
- Not over me.

428
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:54,689
- You're unbelievable, just
because you carry a badge

429
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:56,206
and a gun doesn't make you God.

430
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,965
This isn't the
wild West anymore.

431
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:59,965
- It's still Texas.

432
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,000
- May I use your phone?

433
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,689
- Give me that.

434
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:12,517
- I bet you don't care that
I've seen that brand before.

435
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:16,103
I knew it rang a bell but
I couldn't remember where.

436
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:18,137
And all of a sudden
there it was.

437
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:20,448
- There it was where?

438
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:22,241
- Uncle Hall's house, a
picture, I was nine-years-old,

439
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,551
he beat me half to death
too, 'cause I saw it.

440
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,758
- What was it a picture of?

441
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:28,586
- That's William
Matthews Barker,

442
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:33,034
Billy Roy's great granddaddy.

443
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:36,068
He got stretched for
stealing a dozen eggs

444
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:37,896
to feed his family.

445
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:39,862
- He was hung for taken eggs?

446
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:44,620
- That and the chicken and
the farmer's wife as well.

447
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,103
[man laughs]

448
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:50,172
- What's the flag draped on it?

449
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:53,103
- Oh, it's an ad for the
bunch that killed him.

450
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:57,448
Regulators, they always
left a calling card,

451
00:23:57,517 --> 00:24:00,862
so you'd know who to
give the credit to.

452
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,517
- The Regulators
were vigilantes.

453
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:06,137
- Yeah, and a bunch of citizens

454
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:10,482
who made it their civic duty
to keep the law and order

455
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,206
in east Texas.

456
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:16,310
There wasn't much separating
them from the crooks.

457
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:19,827
Some folks finally got mad
enough to start shooting them.

458
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:23,206
Called themselves
the Moderators,

459
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:24,896
there wasn't a damn thing
moderate about them,

460
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,758
they started a civil war,

461
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:29,413
lasted till the end of the
century, blood flowed like wine

462
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:34,310
and ow [man coughs] it went
straight to their head.

463
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,724
- Is this a Regulators sign?

464
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:40,413
- Yeah, it is,
where'd you get that?

465
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:45,413
- You mind if I borrow
this book and this picture?

466
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:46,344
- All right.

467
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,344
Did you get that?
- Huh?

468
00:24:54,413 --> 00:24:56,172
- Right in here.
- Oh.

469
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,172
You sure you don't wanna
ride over to the church?

470
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,241
- No, no, Cissy
Lane's gonna get me,

471
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,068
we're going to pictures later
and then the dancing maybe.

472
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:12,068
- Well, don't you overdo it.

473
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,068
- Oh, I ain't
aiming to overdo it,

474
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,931
at my age, I'm just
happy to do. [man laughs]

475
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,448
[Billy laughs]

476
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,551
- Well, you take care
of yourself, okay.

477
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,482
- Yeah.

478
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:22,413
- I love you, Uncle Hall.

479
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:24,310
- Let's go Ace.

480
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,172
- I'll see you soon, be careful.

481
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:29,137
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

482
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,655
[slow music]

483
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:37,793
- Family's important, Captain,
you oughta remember that.

484
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,448
Uncle Hall gave me my
first pair of boots,

485
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:44,689
my first drink of whiskey.

486
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:49,724
He was more like a daddy to me

487
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:52,310
than my real daddy really was.

488
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:57,172
Funny how you start out
fighting the men in your lives

489
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:00,517
and wind up being
just like them.

490
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:03,241
Your daughter tells me
that your dad was killed

491
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,275
by his father.

492
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:05,482
How'd all that happen?

493
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:08,206
- Jewel talks too much.

494
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:12,862
My granddaddy was a Ranger,
caught his son, the sheriff

495
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,482
taking money from gamblers.

496
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:21,827
- So, he killed him for
breaking the law a little.

497
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:23,827
That's pretty strict.

498
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,655
- [Rip] Breaking the law's
like getting pregnant, Ace,

499
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:28,655
you can't do it just a little.

500
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:31,517
I guess he got what he earned.

501
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:34,689
- You figure you
got what you earned?

502
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,896
Listen your father's pretty
hard, did you ever forgive him?

503
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:50,206
Holding stuff like that inside
it really eats at your heart.

504
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:54,379
- Who are you, Dear Abby?

505
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,448
Seven o'clock at my place,

506
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,758
don't bother calling
Colonel Boone

507
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,103
about this, Harvey, thanks.

508
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,000
- Parsons had
clippings on nine guys

509
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:08,965
and they all had slipped
through the cracks

510
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:13,275
of the legal system and
walked but not too far.

511
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:15,137
This map shows where they died,

512
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:17,724
all of them murdered but one.

513
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:19,344
Now, Captain, it
don't Sherlock Holmes

514
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:20,862
to figure this one out.

515
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,758
The line between upholding
the law and breaking it

516
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:24,103
is might thin.

517
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:25,758
- If Jack Parsons
was guilty of murder,

518
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:28,413
I'd run him down, slip the

some stopping, you hear?

687
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:44,689
[dramatic music]

688
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:13,827
- May I help you?

689
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:15,517
- Where's Agent Davis's offices?

690
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:17,448
- Is she expecting you?

691
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:19,896
- No, we're just dropping by.

692
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,655
- Well, I'll see
if she's available.

693
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:26,551
Before I do, though firearms
aren't allowed in the building.

694
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,862
- I wore this on my honeymoon,

695
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,827
I'm not taking it
off for the FBI.

696
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,241
[alarm rings]

697
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,310
- It's in reception.
- Let's go!

698
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:40,344
- Hold it right there.
- Hold it.

699
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:44,068
- Looks like the
OK Corral, Captain.

700
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:45,896
- It's too bad you
ain't Wyatt Earp.

701
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:47,965
- That firearm
has to be checked.

702
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:49,413
- The state of Texas
made me swear to die

703
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,413
before given up this gun.

704
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:56,310
- Relax, everybody, I'll keep
an eye on these desperadoes.

705
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:09,034
What do you think you're doing,

706
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:10,655
you can't just come
barging in here like this.

707
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,586
- I got the idea from you.

708
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:15,793
- [Susan] Touché, so
what are you doing here?

709
00:37:15,862 --> 00:37:17,344
- I need some help.

710
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:18,413
- What kind?

711
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,000
- Well, Jack Parsons ain't
gonna let nobody chase him down,

712
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:23,275
so we gotta figure out
where he's gonna surface.

713
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:25,689
- There's one guy on
the list who's alive,

714
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:27,241
his name is Boltinghouse

715
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,068
and Jack's gonna be
watching him real close

716
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:30,655
to see who comes after him.

717
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:32,827
I wanna know where he is.

718
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:37,689
- Can't the rangers
help you on this one?

719
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:40,241
- I've been asked
to stay off it.

720
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,310
I'm asking for your help
on this, not the FBI's.

721
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,689
- Understood, I'm kind of
the lone ranger on this one

722
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:54,344
around here myself.

723
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,034
Boltinghouse is
living in San Marcos,

724
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,689
he's been working
the night shift

725
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:01,310
at the Central
Solvent Warehouse.

726
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,655
Been quiet as a mouse
for months though.

727
00:38:04,724 --> 00:38:06,068
- Some mouse, him and
his old lady stole a car,

728
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:07,965
running all over Texas
shooting and killing

729
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:09,655
like Bonnie and Clyde.

730
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:11,655
[man knocks]

731
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:12,965
- I'll get it.

732
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:14,137
- Yeah and then some
jerk in Waco forgot

733
00:38:14,206 --> 00:38:15,827
to read them their rights.

734
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,551
- It's the law, Rip.

735
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,827
- I worry about that sometimes.

736
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:22,655
- We all do and then we
spend the rest of our lives

737
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:25,034
trying to make the law work.

738
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,758
Isn't that why you're a ranger?

739
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:31,517
- The neighborhoods going
to the dogs, Sheaty's here

740
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:33,517
and he's got a warrant.

741
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,206
- Howdy, Ms. Davis.

742
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:42,137
Let's make this as easy
as possible, Captain.

743
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:43,689
- Nothing hard about it,

744
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:45,310
you're not putting
a foot in my house.

745
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:47,862
- Well, now the search
warrant says that I am.

746
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:50,206
- Am I talking
with my mouth full?

747
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:53,827
- No but maybe you'd
better read my lips,

748
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:58,517
I'm legally authorized
to search these premises,

749
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,413
[speaks in foreign language]?

750
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:02,655
- Actually, you're not, Sheriff,

751
00:39:02,724 --> 00:39:04,758
this warrant is for
Sims Lane in Austin,

752
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:07,034
you're in Dripping Springs.

753
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:09,310
I believe you have
the wrong house.

754
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:12,172
- Who's side are you on?

755
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:16,724
- Who's side, aren't we all
in this together, Sheriff?

756
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:27,137
- Boy, she sure handled
him, huh, Captain?

757
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:29,034
- Thanks for the hand.

758
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:31,655
- Happy to lend it.

759
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:32,896
- Keep that up, we'll make
you an honorary Texas.

760
00:39:32,965 --> 00:39:35,655
- My mom would love that.

761
00:39:35,724 --> 00:39:38,551
Her family, the Jackson's
settled near Shelbyville

762
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,103
in 1820.

763
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:42,896
- East Texas, my
great grand-daddy

764
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:45,344
you never did seem
like east coast to me.

765
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:48,482
You know I can feel
Texas in a person.

766
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,931
- Yeah, but I never lived here,

767
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,103
the family moved
back east in 1900.

768
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,206
- It don't matter, once you
get Texas in your blood,

769
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:56,793
it's always there.

770
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:03,551
Well, I can see the
barometer rising.

771
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:13,206
So, I think I'll check it out.

772
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:22,862
- I can see what he means by
getting Texas in your blood.

773
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:24,206
I love it here.

774
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:27,655
- It gets under your skin.

775
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,206
- I like being in your
house, it feels lived in.

776
00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:35,448
- It should, I raised
three kids here.

777
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:40,724
- [Susan] Nice family,
your wife's very pretty.

778
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,931
- She was, I lost
Pauline and my boy, Sonny

779
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,620
in a car accident
a few years back.

780
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:49,448
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

781
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:57,310
I had the girls living here
with me till just recently.

782
00:40:57,379 --> 00:40:58,896
That helped a lot.

783
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:05,103
And so does time.

784
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:08,482
[slow music]

785
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:22,758
- I never kissed a
Texas Ranger before.

786
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:26,172
- Well, I sure never
kissed an FBI agent.

787
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,448
- This can get
under your skin too.

788
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:31,344
- It can be dangerous.

789
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:35,206
- I'm with the bureau,
I can handle myself

790
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:37,758
in dangerous situations.

791
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:41,034
- I'm not worried about you.

792
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:43,517
[slow music]

793
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:04,241
There's Boltinghouse.

794
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:16,000
- Midnight, every night
at midnight he clocks out,

795
00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:18,310
goes to the bar, gets a beer,

796
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:22,137
a bag of Tom's toasted peanuts,

797
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:26,551
goes over to the jukebox
and plays "Misery and Gin."

798
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,793
Every night it's the same.

799
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:38,482
[dramatic country music]

800
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:40,896
- He's a man of routine.

801
00:42:40,965 --> 00:42:42,689
- I got my feel
of that in prison.

802
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:44,862
I walk around it every chance.

803
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:49,896
Still there is something
nice about the right routine.

804
00:42:49,965 --> 00:42:54,896
Something you depend on, like
a family and job and a woman.

805
00:42:57,206 --> 00:42:58,655
- There ain't nothing
you can depend on, Ace,

806
00:42:58,724 --> 00:42:59,758
not for sure.

807
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:05,724
- No, I guess there ain't.

808
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:10,137
You miss your wife and son
something terrible, don't you?

809
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:12,551
- Terrible don't come close.

810
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,068
Don't you ever
get tired of that?

811
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:20,448
- Tired of what?

812
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:12,000
- There's Jack.

813
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:19,034
[ominous music]

814
00:44:22,896 --> 00:44:24,241
Stay in the car.

815
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:48,448
- Rip, Rip.
- I told you to stay put.

816
00:44:48,517 --> 00:44:50,689
- There's a couple of buzzards
circling around the back.

817
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:53,620
- Come on, they'll be
waiting for Jack too.

818
00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:56,482
[dramatic music]

819
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:41,000
- Hi.
[gun fires]

820
00:46:02,965 --> 00:46:06,172
- It's Boltinghouse.
- Was Boltinghouse.

821
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:14,931
- Bullet through the head.
- That's the same way Slate

822
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,137
was killed.

823
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:21,931
- Jack, wait a minute.
- You better get.

824
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:26,310
- Damn it Jack wait up.

825
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:28,551
Jack?

826
00:46:31,793 --> 00:46:33,206
- Grenade!
- Jump!

827
00:46:34,413 --> 00:46:39,482
[glass breaks]
[men holler]

828
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:43,068
[grenade explodes]

829
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,068
[fire rages]

830
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:02,827
[dramatic music]

831
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:08,172
[slow organ music]

832
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:15,000
- Amen.
- Amen.

833
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:15,931
- Amen.

834
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:23,793
- Jack Parsons never could
tolerate a lot of talk,

835
00:47:23,862 --> 00:47:26,068
so this is gonna be short.

836
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:30,206
He walked tall and
he spoke the truth.

837
00:47:33,137 --> 00:47:35,896
His life made our lives special

838
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:40,344
and his death blows out a
candle that's long shed light

839
00:47:40,413 --> 00:47:41,689
on a dark road.

840
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,862
We're gonna miss him but
we'll never forget him.

841
00:48:03,586 --> 00:48:04,448
- Excuse me.

842
00:48:08,034 --> 00:48:09,448
Are you all right?

843
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:10,379
- Yeah.

844
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:12,655
- I promise we'll
do everything we can

845
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,000
to find who killed him.

846
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:18,137
And if there's anything
I can do, please call.

847
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:18,931
- Thanks.

848
00:48:29,862 --> 00:48:33,137
- You know, I'll tell
you that we discovered

849
00:48:33,206 --> 00:48:35,689
another body in the ashes.

850
00:48:35,758 --> 00:48:37,896
Any idea who that
might be, Captain?

851
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:38,827
- Not yet.

852
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,344
- You know I'm curious
just what the hell

853
00:48:42,413 --> 00:48:44,655
you were doing out
there at that warehouse.

854
00:48:44,724 --> 00:48:46,310
- Halfway expecting you.

855
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:48,655
Seems like every time
I turn around lately,

856
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:51,310
you're breathing down my neck.

857
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:57,172
- Yeah, well that's my job,
I'm looking for a murderer.

858
00:48:57,241 --> 00:48:59,517
Now I've got two more
dead and I'm still looking

859
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:00,931
for a murderer.

861
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:07,413
but stay out of my way or
I'll take you out myself.

862
00:49:08,965 --> 00:49:11,551
- You know a remark like that
doesn't surprise me at all

863
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,827
coming from you, Metcalf.

864
00:49:13,896 --> 00:49:18,724
Going after sheriffs sort of
runs in the family, don't it?

865
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:21,655
- You don't mind if I cut
in here, do you, Sheriff?

866
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:23,068
- Colonel Boone.

867
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,827
- That was a fine eulogy, Rip,

868
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:29,655
Jack would have really liked it.

869
00:49:29,724 --> 00:49:31,551
There's something I'd like to,

870
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,310
why don't you take off
for about a month or so

871
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:37,206
and go fishing and get all
this pain out of your system.

872
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:40,862
- Jack Parsons was the closest
thing I had to a father.

873
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:43,896
He's been taken before his time

874
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:47,137
and someone's gonna
answer to that to me.

875
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:50,068
- You answer to me, Captain.

876
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:51,793
You're like a lightning rod,

877
00:49:51,862 --> 00:49:54,000
you're making things
harder on everybody.

878
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:56,586
I'm not gonna allow that, Rip.

879
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,448
- I never thought I'd find
something more important

880
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:03,689
than being a Texas Ranger.

881
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:09,551
- There is nothing
more important than

882
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:21,137
Come on, Maurice, let's go.

883
00:50:28,689 --> 00:50:29,965
- I don't know if it
means anything or not

884
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:31,758
to you, Captain, but I'd
done the same thing as you,

885
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:33,965
of course I'm extremely crazy.

886
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,206
Now the same people
that killed Parsons

887
00:50:35,275 --> 00:50:37,068

know it'd be a strange pair

welcome to come along.

890
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,551
- I've got my hands
full here, Ace.

891
00:50:45,551 --> 00:50:46,896
- You know me and Parsons
spent a lot of time together

892
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:50,896
and we didn't see eye to
eye on a lot of things.

894
00:50:54,413 --> 00:50:58,068
In fact, we didn't see
eye to eye on nothing

but we did have a lot
in common and he's gone.

hell's gonna be like.

899
00:51:10,965 --> 00:51:12,310
Hey.

900
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:13,586
- Come on, help me
get him out of here.

901
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:17,172
- Not me, I wouldn't touch
him, that's blasphemy.

902
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,551
- Blasphemy, hell,
this is reincarnation,

903
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,620
I got blown out from
way to Copeland.

904
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:23,586
Rip here thought I
should stay dead,

905
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:26,000
that warehouse
was like a cinder,

906
00:51:26,068 --> 00:51:28,551
there wasn't enough left
there for big buzzard bacon.

907
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,275
Well, spic and span, where
were you when it hit the fan?

908
00:51:31,344 --> 00:51:32,758
[Jack laughs]

909
00:51:32,827 --> 00:51:34,344
Why, you with that hair, you
should have been blown up there

910
00:51:34,413 --> 00:51:36,172
like a sky rocket.

911
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:38,517
Well, Rip, I'm ready to go.

912
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:42,137
- Captain, close the lid.

913
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,103
- Thanks for pairing
me for this old 38,

914
00:51:58,172 --> 00:52:00,620
you give me some bullets,
I'll be ready to go.

915
00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:01,931
- I don't need nothing,
you got Parsons,

916
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,862
just give me my
money and I'm gone.

917
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:05,827
- Neither one of you
are going anywhere.

918
00:52:05,896 --> 00:52:07,482
- What the hell are
you talking about?

919
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,965
- The people who want you
dead think you're dead,

920
00:52:09,034 --> 00:52:10,586
let's keep it that way.

921
00:52:10,655 --> 00:52:13,034
- Well, you can't go this alone.

922
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:14,448
- I ain't planning to.

923
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:16,344
Ace here's gonna help me.

924
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:19,413
He'll guard you
if it's necessary.

925
00:52:19,482 --> 00:52:22,068
- Him, that low life
sore rat of a felon.

926
00:52:22,137 --> 00:52:23,931
- I wouldn't spend 10
seconds with that crazy man,

927
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,103
he'd kill me.

928
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:26,620
- You will if you
want your money.

929
00:52:26,689 --> 00:52:29,689
Besides Jack never
shot a deputy Ranger.

930
00:52:29,758 --> 00:52:33,275
- A deputy, you've been pounded
nails by your forehead, Rip.

931
00:52:33,344 --> 00:52:35,931
- Billy Roy Barker, a
deputy Texas Ranger,

932
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,241
how does that sound?

933
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,517
- Like a cow making flop.

934
00:52:45,241 --> 00:52:47,517
I don't even like talking
to a skunk like you

935
00:52:47,586 --> 00:52:50,172
but the Captain told me I
had to tell you everything,

936
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:51,551
so here it goes.

937
00:52:52,413 --> 00:52:53,827
You know a guy
named Nate Tillman?

938
00:52:53,896 --> 00:52:55,344
- Yeah.

939
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:56,793
- Yeah, you were busted there
when you were 14, weren't you,

941
00:52:58,689 --> 00:53:00,103
He's a difficult
man to get to know

942
00:53:00,172 --> 00:53:02,068
but it didn't take me
long to get onto him.

943
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,000
I sat his around his
bar soaking up beers,

944
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:08,344

longing for the days

was so convincing I almost

946
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:13,482
believed it myself.

947
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:14,793
Tillman finally asked me

948
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:16,551
if I'd ever heard
of the Regulators.

949
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,241
I say they was a brave bunch,

950
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,896
it was a damn shame they'd
ever gone out of business.

951
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:22,827
He smiled.

952
00:53:24,758 --> 00:53:27,931
About a month later I
got a note inviting me

953
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,379
to a get together.

954
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:31,172
The signal was a
stuffed armadillo

955
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,655
that Tillman put in the
front window of his bar.

956

They're real clever folks.

957
00:53:36,689 --> 00:53:41,000
I went to three or
four of their meetings.

958
00:53:41,068 --> 00:53:42,310
- Was it three or was it four?

959
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:43,793
- It was four.

960
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:46,655
I never saw a face, 'cause
they had a light in my eyes.

961

Just this big Texas
voice talking.

962
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:51,793
I'd heard that voice before.

963
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,551
I still can't place it.

964
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,137
Finally they gave
me an assignment,

965

Richard Slate.

But the whole thing
was a damn setup.

millimeter killed Slate

970
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:12,103
and then picked up a rifle

971
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:13,827
and then shot that
deputy sheriff outside,

972
00:54:13,896 --> 00:54:16,517
then they knocked
me in the head.

973
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,068
I guess they figured when
I come stumbling out,

974
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:20,896
the police would
shoot me on sight.

975
00:54:20,965 --> 00:54:23,586

[punches face]
[Zeke grunts]

1199
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:31,310
- Careful, Jack, don't kill him.

1200
01:10:31,379 --> 01:10:35,620
- I ain't gonna kill him,
we're just gonna talk.

1201
01:10:39,931 --> 01:10:41,448
- Here.
- That's enough Jack.

1202
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:43,206
- Back off, Rip,
this is personal.

1203
01:10:43,275 --> 01:10:45,689
- Beating up Zeke gonna
right any of them wrongs?

1204
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:47,034
- Give me that.

1205
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,517
- How'd you find us, Captain?

1206
01:10:50,586 --> 01:10:52,586
- You weren't at the cabin,
I figured you'd be here.

1207
01:10:52,655 --> 01:10:53,620
[gun fires]

1208
01:10:53,689 --> 01:10:55,344
[Zeke grunts]

1209
01:10:55,413 --> 01:10:57,793
[climactic music]

1210
01:10:57,862 --> 01:11:00,724
[motorcycle revs]

1211
01:11:13,448 --> 01:11:17,931
- Take these to pathology.
- Right away, doctor.

1212
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,034
- He's out of danger
and he's safe.

1213
01:11:20,103 --> 01:11:22,482
- His danger's just starting,
when can I talk to him?

1214
01:11:22,551 --> 01:11:24,172
- Hour or two.

1215
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:26,931
[machines beep]

1216
01:11:31,965 --> 01:11:34,758
[dramatic music]

1217
01:11:39,827 --> 01:11:42,758
- Parsons is alive,
Metcalf's got him.

1218
01:11:42,827 --> 01:11:45,517
[ominous music]

1219
01:11:47,931 --> 01:11:49,344
No!
[gun fires]

1220
01:11:49,413 --> 01:11:51,206
[Zeke grunts]

1221
01:11:51,275 --> 01:11:53,965
[machine beeps]

1222
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:09,241
- You know, I've been thinking.

1223
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:11,586
- Well, don't think, don't
talk, don't do nothing,

1224
01:12:11,655 --> 01:12:12,793
just stay out of my way.

1225
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,448
- You think this
damn rig will work?

1226
01:12:14,517 --> 01:12:16,689
- I try to mind my own business,

1227
01:12:16,758 --> 01:12:18,448
I suggest you do the same thing.

1228
01:12:18,517 --> 01:12:20,206
- Well, if it was mine, I'd
use 30 weight motor oil,

1229
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:22,310
paint that string black.

1230
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:38,724
- Of the six plates you gave me,

1231
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:40,413
I came up with names on five.

1232
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:42,206
They're still working
on the other one,

1233
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:46,103
something to do with the
change in registration.

1234
01:12:46,172 --> 01:12:47,379
Now if I knew where
these came from

1235
01:12:47,448 --> 01:12:51,310
or why you were interested,
maybe I could help.

1236
01:12:51,379 --> 01:12:55,344
- I think they might
have killed Jack Parsons.

1237
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:59,689
- Henshaw's a Texas Ranger
and Sheaty, are you sure?

1238
01:13:04,344 --> 01:13:05,172
- No.

1239
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:10,482
- What do you think
is going on, Rip?

1240
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:13,724
- What do you know
about the Regulators?

1241
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:16,482
[phone rings]

1242
01:13:16,551 --> 01:13:18,551
- Colonel.
- Rip,

1243
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,965
someone just put three
bullets through Zeke Henshaw

1244
01:13:21,034 --> 01:13:23,310
in the hospital, it's
probably the same character

1245
01:13:23,379 --> 01:13:24,965
that killed Parsons.

1246
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:26,379
They'll be coming
after you next.

1247
01:13:26,448 --> 01:13:27,620
- I hear that.

1248
01:13:32,413 --> 01:13:34,379
- What's even crazier is
that the governor thinks-

1249
01:13:34,448 --> 01:13:37,034
- I brought Zeke Henshaw
into the rangers,

1250
01:13:37,103 --> 01:13:38,862
taught him everything I know,

1251
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:40,965
I must have left something
out, 'cause he's dead.

1252
01:13:41,034 --> 01:13:43,689
- Henshaw, Sheaty
Tillman, George Lockwood,

1253
01:13:43,758 --> 01:13:45,103
Billy Lee Brunner.

1254
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:47,379
- Billy Lee Brunner, he
owns half of Pflugerville,

1255
01:13:47,448 --> 01:13:49,206
I used to fish with his dad.

1256
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:50,896
- Money and power,
some heavy hitters.

1257
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:53,655
- More rattles, we gotta
find the head of the snake.

1258
01:13:53,724 --> 01:13:57,448
- There's something seriously
rotten in the great state

1259
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:58,896
of-
- Him!

1260
01:13:58,965 --> 01:14:03,275
That's him, that's the head of
the snake, that's the voice!

1261
01:14:03,344 --> 01:14:04,517
- The governor's office-

1262
01:14:04,586 --> 01:14:07,172
- I've heard this campaign ad

1263
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:10,000
so many times I stopped
listening to it.

1264
01:14:10,068 --> 01:14:12,413
- Nobody pays any attention
to campaign ads anyway.

1265
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:16,206
- That's right, that's why
I couldn't place this voice.

1266
01:14:16,275 --> 01:14:18,689
- [Man] Without the law and
people willing to fight for it.

1267
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:22,551
We have no society,
we have a jungle.

1268
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,896
- A little too much-

1269
01:14:23,965 --> 01:14:25,310
- Right out of the
mouth of the snake.

1270
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:26,793
- [Announcer] Paid
for by the Committee

1271
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,206
to Elect Bud Hoffner governor.

1272
01:14:28,275 --> 01:14:29,448
- Come on, let's go
get him, I know how

1273
01:14:29,517 --> 01:14:30,931
to skin a rattlesnake.

1274
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,896
- Not yet, a tape and a hunch
ain't gonna hold up in court.

1275
01:14:34,965 --> 01:14:36,965
- Well Hoffner and his bunch
don't care about courts.

1276
01:14:37,034 --> 01:14:38,586
- Well, we're not them.

1277
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:39,931
That's what this is all about.

1278
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,448
- Oh, hell, Rip, who put that
morality bug in your ear.

1279
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,275
- You did.

1280
01:14:49,724 --> 01:14:51,827
- The license plate Susan
couldn't find must be Hoffners.

1281
01:14:51,896 --> 01:14:53,793
That would put him
at the farmhouse

1282
01:14:53,862 --> 01:14:55,931
and then that tape would
be worth something.

1283
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,482
- Susan's working on it.

1284
01:14:57,551 --> 01:15:00,413
- Well, let's give Susan a hand.

1285
01:15:06,862 --> 01:15:10,448
- This license plate is part
of a classified sequence

1286
01:15:10,517 --> 01:15:11,931
assigned by the
federal government.

1287
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
- What part of the government?
- FBI.

1288
01:15:18,103 --> 01:15:19,275
- It ain't necessarily
her, Captain,

1289
01:15:19,344 --> 01:15:22,034
there must be 10 or 15
agents in Austin alone.

1290
01:15:22,103 --> 01:15:23,965
- In the middle of the
picture, what do you see?

1291
01:15:24,034 --> 01:15:25,379
- A man who died for no reason.

1292
01:15:25,448 --> 01:15:27,241
- No that sign.

1293
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:29,931
- Shelbyville Liberty,
well he's from Nacogdoches,

1294
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,172
that's not far away.

1295
01:15:31,241 --> 01:15:34,620
- Susan's family's
from Shelbyville.

1296
01:15:34,689 --> 01:15:35,551
- Uh-oh.

1297
01:15:38,379 --> 01:15:40,551
The Regulators started
in Shelby County.

1298
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,862
The base operation
was Shelbyville.

1299
01:15:42,931 --> 01:15:45,931
The leader was named
Charles W. Jackson.

1300
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,931
- Jackson's Susan's family name.

1301
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,793
- Well ain't you slicker
than soap on a door knob.

1302
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:56,103
Of course she couldn't
trace that car, it was hers.

1303
01:15:56,172 --> 01:15:57,482
- It looks that way.

1304
01:15:57,551 --> 01:16:00,379
- FBI agent dancing cheek
to cheek with Hoffner,

1305
01:16:00,448 --> 01:16:03,482
using whatever she could
to get close to you

1306
01:16:03,551 --> 01:16:05,448
so she could pick your brain.

1307
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:08,137
- You should have known better.

1308
01:16:08,206 --> 01:16:12,034
- Well, Rip, that's
spilled milk, so to speak.

1309
01:16:14,517 --> 01:16:16,103
Now look here, let me
tell you one thing.

1310
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:18,586
Hoffner's gonna have this
big fundraiser tomorrow.

1311
01:16:18,655 --> 01:16:20,793
Let's get over there and
stick a pistol in his ear

1312
01:16:20,862 --> 01:16:23,413
and make him sing
like Julio Iglesias.

1313
01:16:23,482 --> 01:16:26,241
[dramatic music]

1314
01:16:28,724 --> 01:16:30,448
[ominous music]

1315
01:16:30,517 --> 01:16:32,379
[bottles rattle]

1316
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:34,379
- There goes my
perimeter tent system.

1317
01:16:34,448 --> 01:16:35,689
- What?

1318
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,586
- Beer bottles and bailing
wire but it's working.

1319
01:16:37,655 --> 01:16:39,448
Captain we got bogies.

1320
01:16:40,482 --> 01:16:44,068
- Sure do, Rip, about
maybe five, maybe six,

1321
01:16:46,517 --> 01:16:49,172
the more the merrier, beats
the hell out of "Kojak" reruns,

1322
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:51,827
well I got the front,
you cover my back, okay.

1323
01:16:51,896 --> 01:16:54,896
Deputy skunk here will
pass the ammunition.

1324
01:16:54,965 --> 01:16:56,620
- Hell with that, I'm a
deputy, throw me a gun.

1325
01:16:56,689 --> 01:16:59,448
[dramatic music]

1326
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:07,827
[glass breaks]

1327
01:17:07,896 --> 01:17:11,413
- I'm here, come on,
come to Uncle Jack,

1328
01:17:11,482 --> 01:17:13,793
let me give you the
hot kiss of death!

1329
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,000
[gun fires]

1330
01:17:16,068 --> 01:17:18,310
[glass breaks]

1331
01:17:18,379 --> 01:17:21,689
Ha, it don't get no better
than this, does it, criminal!

1332
01:17:21,758 --> 01:17:23,275
- [Billy] Yeah, this is a
real piece of heaven, Jack!

1333
01:17:23,344 --> 01:17:24,689
- Ha, I love it.

1334
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,517
- Who's driving?
- You.

1335
01:17:30,172 --> 01:17:31,620
- Ah-yeah.
- Damn!

1336
01:17:37,172 --> 01:17:40,068
[car crashes]

1337
01:17:40,137 --> 01:17:42,482
[gun fires]

1338
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:51,517
- [Billy] I bet this road was
rough before they taped it.

1339
01:17:51,586 --> 01:17:53,931
- [Jack] Boy you just drive.

1340
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:12,793
- What's going on?

1341
01:18:15,413 --> 01:18:18,137
Rip, what are you doing?

1342
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:22,000
Billy Roy, what's going
on here guys, come on?

1343
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,517
Will someone tell
me what's going on?

1344
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:28,517
- Sit down.

1345
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,448
- Just say something, anything,
what the hell is going on?

1346
01:18:31,517 --> 01:18:32,724
- Me, for one.

1347
01:18:34,344 --> 01:18:35,379
- And a couple of other things,

1348
01:18:35,448 --> 01:18:37,241
I've been reading up
on the Regulators,

1349
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:40,137
Charles Jackson made
quite a name for himself

1350
01:18:40,206 --> 01:18:41,517
over in Shelbyville.

1351
01:18:41,586 --> 01:18:43,965
- We traced those license plates
you couldn't seem to find.

1352
01:18:44,034 --> 01:18:45,827
- It isn't what you think it is.

1353
01:18:45,896 --> 01:18:50,413
- You don't wanna know what
I think but I want the truth.

1354
01:18:50,482 --> 01:18:52,758
- All right, the truth is,
I'm working with Hoffner

1355
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:53,862
and the FBI.

1356
01:18:55,206 --> 01:18:58,793
I've been undercover
inside Hoffner's group

1357
01:18:59,896 --> 01:19:01,482
now for three months.

1358
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:03,275
No one knows, not
even the bureau.

1359
01:19:03,344 --> 01:19:04,827
- Oh shoot.

1360
01:19:04,896 --> 01:19:08,896
- I didn't know who I
could trust, not even you.

1361
01:19:10,103 --> 01:19:11,379
I met Hoffner at a fundraiser,

1362
01:19:11,448 --> 01:19:14,344
somehow the family name
came up and he recognized it

1363
01:19:14,413 --> 01:19:16,517
and started talking
about the Regulators.

1364
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:20,241
I could tell he was
fishing so I nibbled.

1365
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:22,103
We stayed in touch
and he finally told

1366
01:19:22,172 --> 01:19:24,137
and invited me to join.

1367
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:28,551
He loved the fact that the
great-great granddaughter

1368
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,310
of Charles Jackson was involved.

1369
01:19:31,379 --> 01:19:34,551
He trusted me, I got
close to him fast.

1370
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:42,172
Henshaw knew Parsons
was undercover.

1371
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:43,758
Slate's murder was a set up.

1372
01:19:43,827 --> 01:19:45,448
- Where were you?

1373
01:19:45,517 --> 01:19:46,965
- I got word to Sheaty
about the set up

1374
01:19:47,034 --> 01:19:48,206
through an informant.

1375
01:19:48,275 --> 01:19:50,103
I figured that would
protect Slate and Parsons.

1376
01:19:50,172 --> 01:19:53,482
It was only later that
I found out that Sheaty

1377
01:19:53,551 --> 01:19:54,827
was one of them.

1378
01:19:54,896 --> 01:19:57,931
And when Parsons got away.
- Oh, call me Jack.

1379
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,344
- When Jack got away,
Hoffner was furious.

1380
01:20:04,172 --> 01:20:06,827
It was everyone's
job to find him.

1381
01:20:06,896 --> 01:20:09,448
- So, you snuggled up to me
hoping I'd take you to him?

1382
01:20:09,517 --> 01:20:11,931
- Yes before they found him.

1383
01:20:14,724 --> 01:20:17,310
I needed you alive, you're
the best witness I've got.

1384
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:18,689
- Hell, I ain't had so
much fun since the hogs

1385
01:20:18,758 --> 01:20:20,827
ate my little brother.

1386
01:20:20,896 --> 01:20:24,482
- That's why I went to the
hotel to try to warn Parsons

1387
01:20:24,551 --> 01:20:26,620
without blowing my
cover with Hoffner.

1388
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,068
- You could have told me.

1389
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:30,068
- No I couldn't, I didn't
know who was involved.

1390
01:20:30,137 --> 01:20:33,793
I couldn't take that
chance for Jack's sake.

1391
01:20:36,034 --> 01:20:38,137
I had to protect him.

1392
01:20:38,206 --> 01:20:40,862
I'm an agent and a good one

1393
01:20:40,931 --> 01:20:44,413
but I'm a rotten liar
when it comes to things

1394
01:20:44,482 --> 01:20:46,689
that matter to me.

1395
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:49,068
And if I was working for them

1396
01:20:50,172 --> 01:20:53,758
you would have known I was
pretending when I was with you.

1397
01:20:53,827 --> 01:20:56,275
You know I wasn't pretending.

1398
01:21:02,655 --> 01:21:05,206
Hoffner's the only one that
knows everyone involved.

1399
01:21:05,275 --> 01:21:06,517
He keeps the whole
membership list

1400
01:21:06,586 --> 01:21:10,103
in a 25 cent three by five
purple spiral notebook.

1401
01:21:10,172 --> 01:21:13,379
It has a TCU insignia
on the front.

1402
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:14,827
He's a big Froggies' fan.

1403
01:21:14,896 --> 01:21:16,103
- Do you know where it is?

1404
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:18,344
- I've seen it several
times in his hotel suite.

1405
01:21:18,413 --> 01:21:20,482
He hides it somewhere
in the library.

1406
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:25,103
Now how to get it is another
question all together.

1407
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,172
- Well, it's a good thing

1408
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:30,413
you all got a criminal
like me around.

1409
01:21:33,034 --> 01:21:36,862
- It's so good to see
you, so good to see you.

1410
01:21:39,517 --> 01:21:41,758
I appreciate that, Sweetie.

1411
01:21:42,655 --> 01:21:44,724
How are you, how are you?

1412
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:55,034
- Mr. And Mrs. R.
Johnson, $100,000.

1413
01:21:55,103 --> 01:21:56,896
- Jobeth, how are you?

1414
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:02,034
[people chatter]

1415
01:22:12,275 --> 01:22:14,862
[violin music]

1416
01:22:18,344 --> 01:22:19,862
- Okay you all go on,
I'll see you later,

1417
01:22:19,931 --> 01:22:22,793
I'm gonna find a
limb to perch on.

1418
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:30,724
[people chatter]

1419
01:22:31,689 --> 01:22:33,034
- What is that?

1420
01:22:33,103 --> 01:22:35,689
- Crab soufflé on marinated
hearts of palm, delicious.

1421
01:22:35,758 --> 01:22:37,275
- No thank you.

1422
01:22:37,344 --> 01:22:38,413
What's that?

1423
01:22:38,482 --> 01:22:40,241
- This is quail egg
wrapped in seaweed.

1424
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,413
- And how's that cooked?

1425
01:22:41,482 --> 01:22:44,793
- Well, it's not, it's
supposed to be raw.

1426
01:22:50,379 --> 01:22:53,344
- How are you, good to see you.

1427
01:22:53,413 --> 01:22:54,862
- Looks like Tiffany's
Christmas catalog,

1428
01:22:54,931 --> 01:22:56,448
Captain, I think
I'll browse around.

1429
01:22:56,517 --> 01:22:57,965
- No you won't.
- Five minutes.

1430
01:22:58,034 --> 01:23:00,793
Four minutes.
- Forget it.

1431
01:23:00,862 --> 01:23:03,241
- This is like locking
Trevino on a golf course

1432
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:04,965
and not letting him play.

1433
01:23:05,034 --> 01:23:07,000
- What a lovely outfit.

1434
01:23:14,344 --> 01:23:16,758
[indistinct]

1435
01:23:19,827 --> 01:23:21,275
- Hoffner's has a suite
on the ninth floor,

1436
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:25,344
I'll get you in the private
elevator, follow me.

1437
01:23:35,172 --> 01:23:37,379
Here, this will get
you into his suite,

1438
01:23:37,448 --> 01:23:38,896
now use the back entrance,
'cause there's always a guard

1439
01:23:38,965 --> 01:23:40,068
by the front.

1440
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:46,103
Be careful.
- Nice dress.

1441
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:52,275
[Susan sighs]

1442
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,068
I'll check out the guard.

1443
01:24:11,206 --> 01:24:13,551
He's right outside the door.

1444
01:24:17,103 --> 01:24:18,206
- You know sometimes
you gotta let the room

1445
01:24:18,275 --> 01:24:21,000
tell you what
you're looking for.

1446
01:24:25,896 --> 01:24:27,931
Ego is an amazing thing.

1447
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:37,931
It was just one of
them old Wrigley's,

1448
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,310
I don't know why they bothered

1449
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:42,034
hiding a piece of tin like this.

1450
01:24:46,862 --> 01:24:47,896
- He's here.

1451
01:24:50,275 --> 01:24:51,137
[dramatic music]

1452
01:24:51,206 --> 01:24:52,103
- Let's go.

1453
01:24:58,137 --> 01:24:59,000
There it is.

1454
01:25:07,862 --> 01:25:10,206
- Let's get out of here.

1455
01:25:10,275 --> 01:25:11,068
[ominous music]

1456
01:25:11,137 --> 01:25:13,103
- Gun belt, cowboy.

1457
01:25:13,172 --> 01:25:17,034
- Well now, isn't this
a sad site, right now,

1458
01:25:17,103 --> 01:25:19,862
another Texas Ranger gone bad.

1459
01:25:19,931 --> 01:25:22,413
Seems like an epidemic lately.

1460
01:25:22,482 --> 01:25:23,344
- Hmm-mm.

1461
01:25:26,137 --> 01:25:28,241
- You're smoother than
14-year-old whiskey.

1462
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:29,379
- Thank you.

1463
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,827
- Isn't she, though.

1464
01:25:33,896 --> 01:25:37,413
Sold you on that idea
about being a double agent.

1465
01:25:37,482 --> 01:25:39,689
And then set you all
up to come over here

1466
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:43,965
looking for that, just
so you could get caught

1467
01:25:44,034 --> 01:25:47,551
with your fingers
in the cookie jar.

1468
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,896
Law and order is the issue
of this campaign gentlemen.

1469
01:25:49,965 --> 01:25:51,931
You've proven my point.

1470
01:25:52,931 --> 01:25:54,620
- No, you proved it.

1471
01:25:56,103 --> 01:25:59,620
- We know all about
the Regulators,

1472
01:25:59,689 --> 01:26:03,206
Boltinghouse and the Slate and
the others you had murdered.

1473
01:26:03,275 --> 01:26:05,689
And we know you
killed Zeke Henshaw.

1474
01:26:05,758 --> 01:26:09,620
- Yes, yes and I'm
proud, we're all proud

1475
01:26:09,689 --> 01:26:13,275
to be the instrument of
justice in a lawless time.

1476
01:26:13,344 --> 01:26:15,551
- You won't be able
to hide the truth.

1477
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:19,655
- Truth [laughs], who's
gonna believe a couple

1478
01:26:19,724 --> 01:26:22,344
of petty criminals, hmm?

1479
01:26:22,413 --> 01:26:24,000
- Maybe no one but they
might believe a Texas Ranger

1480
01:26:24,068 --> 01:26:25,931
and FBI agent and you.

1481
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:28,344
[gun fires]

1482
01:26:28,413 --> 01:26:31,103
[man grunts]
[climactic music]

1483
01:26:31,172 --> 01:26:32,965
- Stop him fool!

1484
01:26:33,034 --> 01:26:34,413
- Watch her.

1485
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:35,620
[gun fires]

1486
01:26:35,689 --> 01:26:38,551
[climactic music]

1487
01:26:48,241 --> 01:26:50,862
[women scream]

1488
01:27:03,655 --> 01:27:04,517
- Hey!

1489
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:16,517
[people exclaim]

1490
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:21,586
- Read this.

1491
01:27:25,172 --> 01:27:27,793
[women scream]

1492
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:45,137
Damn.

1493
01:27:46,482 --> 01:27:49,413
[climactic music]

1494
01:27:51,172 --> 01:27:52,793
Break his damn neck.

1495
01:27:52,862 --> 01:27:54,379
- Hold it, let go!

1496
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:59,413
- Excuse me, sir could I have
that gun please, thank you.

1497
01:27:59,482 --> 01:28:02,448
- Thank you, deputy.
- You're under arrest.

1498
01:28:02,517 --> 01:28:05,482
- Well, Rip, it's over.
- Not yet.

1499
01:28:07,103 --> 01:28:08,896
[punches man]
[audience exclaims]

1500
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:10,275
[glass breaks]

1501
01:28:10,344 --> 01:28:12,551
[Jack hollers]

1502
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,862
- [Billy] Nice left.

1503
01:28:15,931 --> 01:28:18,137
- We got the main honchos,
Hoffner and Sheaty.

1504
01:28:18,206 --> 01:28:21,586
- Yeah, without that notebook,
the rest of those crazies

1505
01:28:21,655 --> 01:28:23,137
stay free.

1506
01:28:23,206 --> 01:28:26,862
- Let's keep our chin
up, we'll get them all.

1507
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:28,965
- You all wait a minute.

1508
01:28:30,517 --> 01:28:31,655
- What in the hell's this?

1509
01:28:31,724 --> 01:28:35,310
- Susie, you got a lot
to learn about women.

1510
01:28:36,931 --> 01:28:38,206
- Hell all a ranger
needs to be happy

1511
01:28:38,275 --> 01:28:41,965
is a horse with a smooth gait
and a gun that don't jam.

1512
01:28:42,034 --> 01:28:43,655
- Hey that's good, because
the thought of you procreating

1513
01:28:43,724 --> 01:28:45,827
with anybody scares me to death.

1514
01:28:45,896 --> 01:28:46,931
- It should.

1515
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,068
- My cowboys.

1516
01:28:57,517 --> 01:29:00,137
- I'm starving to death,
ain't you?

1517
01:29:00,206 --> 01:29:01,689
- We ate a half an hour ago.

1518
01:29:01,758 --> 01:29:02,620
Oh yeah.

1519
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,034
[slow music]

1520
01:29:20,034 --> 01:29:21,310
- Those are very thoughtful.

1521
01:29:21,379 --> 01:29:23,896
- It was Billy Roy's idea.

1522
01:29:23,965 --> 01:29:27,275
- It don't matter.
- It don't matter?

1523
01:29:27,344 --> 01:29:29,310
- It's the Texas in my blood.

1524
01:29:29,379 --> 01:29:30,827
- It's the drugs.

1525
01:29:32,068 --> 01:29:37,034
- I've been promoted,
supervisory special

1526
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,551
- It's what you deserve,
is it what you want?

1527
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:49,310
- It's what I wanted.

1528
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:52,034
- Well, give it a try.

1529
01:29:57,103 --> 01:29:58,586
If it don't work out you
could always come back here,

1530
01:29:58,655 --> 01:30:01,655
get a pickup truck,
a pair of boots,

1531
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:05,344
see if you're a real Texan.

1532
01:30:05,413 --> 01:30:07,379
- Yeah.

1533
01:30:12,827 --> 01:30:14,000
- Where's Jack?

1534
01:30:14,068 --> 01:30:15,724
- Watching TV over
in the waiting room,

1535
01:30:15,793 --> 01:30:18,517
"The Wild Bunch" is on, said
he'd meet you at the house.

1536
01:30:18,586 --> 01:30:19,758
You okay, Captain?

1537
01:30:19,827 --> 01:30:22,413
- Susan's being
transferred to Pittsburgh.

1538
01:30:22,482 --> 01:30:24,517
- Well, that invitation
to Mexico is still open

1539
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:26,241
if you wanna go
down there with me,

1540
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:27,965
it's a good place to relax.

1541
01:30:28,034 --> 01:30:30,103
- I'll keep that in mind.

1542
01:30:31,137 --> 01:30:33,068
Bus station.
- Bus station?

1543
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:37,448
Bus station, last time you
run me out of Texas, I flew,

1544
01:30:37,517 --> 01:30:38,931
this set a precedent.

1545
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,793
- Don't get comfortable with
it, you ain't coming back.

1546
01:30:41,862 --> 01:30:44,689
- Well, it's gonna be hard
to leave without money.

1547
01:30:44,758 --> 01:30:47,344
- You earned it this time, Ace.

1548
01:30:49,413 --> 01:30:51,827
- I earned it the first time.

1549
01:30:58,965 --> 01:31:01,379
Good-looking money
clip, ain't it?

1550
01:31:01,448 --> 01:31:04,689
Looks even better when
it's full of money.

1551
01:31:04,758 --> 01:31:05,965
Oh, one thing.

1552
01:31:09,344 --> 01:31:10,689
I slipped that up my
sleeve the other night

1553
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:15,103
over at Hoffner's, I had a
backup that I brought with me.

1554
01:31:17,517 --> 01:31:19,448
You could at least
say thank you.

1555
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:21,896
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1556
01:31:22,965 --> 01:31:27,620
I need a favor, one more thing
that needs taken care of.

1557
01:31:29,758 --> 01:31:34,689
Cecil Merritt Metcalf, your
middle name is Cecil, isn't it?

1558
01:31:36,034 --> 01:31:39,000
It's a good thing
they call you Rip.

1559
01:31:39,068 --> 01:31:40,068
Of course when it's family

1560
01:31:40,137 --> 01:31:43,724
you gotta take the
good with the bad.

1561
01:31:43,793 --> 01:31:45,586
- Needs some tending.

1562
01:31:48,827 --> 01:31:51,275
[slow music]

1563
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:52,448
[car starts]

1564
01:31:52,517 --> 01:31:53,379
- I'll park it in the
white zone, Captain

1565
01:31:53,448 --> 01:31:55,137
with the keys under the mat.

1566
01:31:55,206 --> 01:32:00,206
[upbeat country music]
[Billy laughs]

1567
01:32:03,827 --> 01:32:06,344
- You're a piece of work, Ace.

1568
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:12,793
[slow country music]

1569
01:32:58,896 --> 01:33:03,931
[whimsical music]
[baby laughs]
