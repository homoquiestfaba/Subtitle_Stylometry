I guess it's no.

Keri. - Thank you so much for coming.

a sneak peek at, uh...

33

I guess what I'm
trying to say, Carl,

34
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,700
is that the other four agencies
are probably laughing,

35
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,831
at the fact that we're
even in the running

36
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:03,830
for your business.

37
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:08,210

Yup, it's me again.
Not cool blowin' off your dad.

All right, well, call me

Hey, can I... Can I get
some volume on this?

Hey, excuse me!

52
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,410
Can I get some sound?
Can you turn this up, please?

53
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,639
<i>A tragedy of this magnitude...
absolutely heartbreaking</i>

54
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:26,996

<i>Sarah had dreamed

61
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:12,316
- ... quite a bit.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:15,867

that we are here for you.

68
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,844
You have got to let go
of this, honey. Just cry.

69
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,568
You're just being too strong
Give me a call, sweetie, okay?

70
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,584
Oh, God.

71
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,495
I'm sorry.

72
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:16,846
Ms. Tamburg said
I could come up.

73
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,238
I'm Kate.

74

75
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,391
Sort of, we dated.

76
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,316
For about a year.

77
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,131
That's me.

78
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:37,082
You're his dad, right?

79
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,805
You're Sam.

80
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,226
He spoke about you.

81
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:47,739
Highly of you.

82
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,924
He was really sweet to me.

83
00:08:56,642 --> 00:08:59,010
He was always
very sweet to me.

84
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,037
Honey.

85
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:03,633
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

86
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:06,695
- I'm so sorry.
- I know, honey.

87
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:10,287
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

88
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,889
I know.

89
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,458
- Okay! It's him.
- We got him.

90
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:20,289
All right,
let's rock and roll.

91
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:23,431
- Okay, lemme get a three-quarter shot.
- Good, good, good.

92
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,310
Catch him out of the car.
Catch him out of the car.

93
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,518
Mr. Manning! Have you spoken
to any of the other parents?

94
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:36,484
Has anybody been
in contact with you?

95
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:38,592
Mr. Manning,
how was the funeral?

96
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:40,505
Just a statement.
Mr. Manning!

97
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:43,619
Mr. Manning!
Please, just one second.

98
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:46,554
Mr. Manning,
how is your ex-wife?

99
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,204
Fuck!

100
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:33,417
Oh, shit.

101
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,889
Hey, excuse me.
Do you have a back way out?

102
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:44,078
Yeah...
An exit?

103
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,114
You do?
Oh, never mind.

104
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,229
Just, uh, keep it.

105
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,133
Mr. Manning?

106
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:54,669
Mr. Manning!
I hate to bother you.

107
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,273
Oh, yeah? Well, if you hated it so much,
you wouldn't be doin' it, would you?

108
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,510
Do you feel that the school
bears any responsibility for...

109
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:01,631
You know, lemme ask
you a question first.

110
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:04,324
You're a heartless,
bottom-feeding motherfucker.

111
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:07,194
Well, I guess it's not really
a question, is it?

112
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,902
- Sam.
- Hey. I'm fine.

113
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,474
I'm okay. I'm serious.
Hey, hey, hey.

114
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:51,769
- Sam! - Does that seem
like I'm not okay?

115
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,012
You shouldn't be here, okay?
You should probably go home.

116
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,432
Hey, hey. Wanna come inside?
Check how fine I really am.

117
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,051
Sam!

118
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,739
How nice to see you, too!

119
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:05,672
She can't keep
her hands off me.

120
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,310
- Professional help.
- Yes, yes, yes.

121
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,298
How many times
did you go see him?

122
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,498
Well, I mean, I didn't actually
see the guy yet, but...

123
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,449
I didn't see him, but I did talk to him
on the phone, and... Nice guy.

124
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,484
Listen.

125
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:24,431
We're doing fine here.

126
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,848
- Take the time that you need to...
- Hey, hey.

127
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,158
I appreciate that concern.
I really do.

128
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,978
But what I need is to work.

129
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:39,287
What I need is to come in here every
day and I'm gonna sell some tacos.

130
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:41,111
Okay? I gotta write
some catchy copy

131
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:44,295
and I gotta put
on a suit, tie and smile.

132
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,407
Face the future.
That...

133
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,074
That's what I need.

134
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:50,232
Sam, I need to talk to you.

135
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:52,430
Late for work.
Catch me tonight.

136
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:55,209
- No, this is important.
- Late for work, Alard.

137
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:59,532
No, this is important! I implore you.
We can walk and talk.

138
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:29,229
Was beginning to wonder if you
needed a written invitation

139
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,014
- to come to work today.
- No invitation necessary.

140
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,241
Days with these fine gentlemen
is what I get out of bed for.

141
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,928
Don't be late again.

142
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:41,833
You know what I'm sayin'?

143
00:15:42,478 --> 00:15:44,372
Don't be late again.

144
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:51,381
Yeah, you wouldn't
wanna lose this job, huh?

145
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,526
You wanna get
a beer after work?

146
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:59,571
Me and Carlos are gonna go
over to Trill to get some.

147
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:01,711
I don't drink.

148
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,720
You best check your cologne,
because...

149
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,606
you smell like you drink.

150
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,632
Evenin'.

151
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,726
<i># Don't call me

152
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:31,162

153
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,562

155

156
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:40,625
<i># And that the girl that I

157
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,531
<i># Wasn't anybody...</i>

158
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:44,465
Hey, man, I didn't think you
were gonna make it.

159
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:46,310
Yeah, what you drinkin'?

160
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:50,127
- Uh, I'm gonna get a Mustang Wheat.
No lemon. - Wheat?

161
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:53,791
<i>#You're whore!</i>

162

00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,941
So what's your
story anyway, man?

165
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,740
I mean,

166
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:07,578
why you paintin' houses?

167
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,089
And don't give me that shit
about NASA again.

168
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,195
All right, promise
you won't tell?

169
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:15,864
I'm in the witness

00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,879
I fingered Gotti.

171
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:21,544
Fine.
Don't tell me.

172
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,000

Thank you.

176
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:39,547
Okay!
That was, uh...

177
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:43,667
That was Peaches.
Thank you... Peaches.

Hey, stranger.

184
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:28,518
You're not really gonna
stroll up acting like

185
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,242
- we're running into one another
at the mall? - Oh, this is gonna be

186
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:33,982
one of those moments where no
matter what I say, it's wrong, isn't it?

187
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,118
Tell me, Sam,
how should I be acting?

188
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,400
What is the appropriate tone
for having to track down

189
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:43,008
your ex-husband who's hiding out two
and a half hours away on a boat?

190
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:44,721
I'm not hiding.

191
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:48,341
- You're not hiding?
- What do you want, Em?

192
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:51,449
Your signature. I'm putting
the house on the market.

193
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:55,896
And I'm here. And I'm tired. And
I have a long drive ahead of me.

194
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:57,624
Could've forged it.

195
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:00,714
You're right, I could've.

196
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,393
Maybe I was worried about you.
Should I be worried?

197
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:06,606
I'm fine. Come on, I'm livin'
the dream. On a boat.

198
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:14,493
It's marked everywhere
I need a signature.

199
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:23,585
His name's Phillip.

200
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,262
Wow. Okay.
Yeah.

201
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,633
He's 11 months old.

202
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:32,206
That's fantastic.

203
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:34,662
He is a miracle.

204
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:39,923
A $200,000 miracle,
but he is a...

205
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,215
beautiful, healthy boy.

206
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,007
We're moving to Tulsa.

207
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,823
Tom's dad isn't
doing so well.

208
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:54,678
That's great.

209
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:56,002
I mean, I'm sorry.

210
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,955
And I finally decided
to let go of a few things.

211
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,516
I saved this for you.
Music was always you guys' thing.

212
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,331
I couldn't even
open the boxes.

213
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,372
Hold on, I don't
have room for that.

214
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:08,788
- What do you mean? - Like, the boat.
It's not big enough. Sorry.

215
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,896
- You can't be serious.
- What do want me to say?

216
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:15,722
I don't know. It took me over two
years to get to a point where I can

217
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:19,527
clean out his room, and you,
you don't care about his stuff?

218
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,469
- That's not fair.
- Isn't it?

219
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:24,294
- Well, get pissed! It's not going to
make my boat any bigger. - No! No!

220
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:29,497
If you wanna act like
Josh never existed,

221
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:32,161
if hiding makes it
easier for you, great.

222
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:35,120
But make no mistake,
you are hiding!

It's Alaird.

Ooh, these are the kind of
days worth working for, huh?

- I just wanna be forthright
and honest. - Oh, good.

250
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:57,436
I had to file another complaint about
you relieving yourself in the lake.

they wouldn't know greatness if it...

They just wouldn't know it.
They wouldn't... know it.

I don't mean to be rude,
but you're, uh,

00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:28,010
you're quite drunk, Mr. Dick.

give you a ride?

306
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:47,974
Oh, crap.
Crap.

00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,256
Hello?

312
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:47,957
- Hello!
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

313
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:51,578
You're supposed to
be invited on board.

314
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:54,782
- Sorry, sorry.
- Stop. Come back.

315
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:07,029
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

316
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:11,324
I thought you might like a donut. Buck's
Space Age. They're like edible heaven.

317
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:14,259
Good, as in I'd have
one over sex.

318
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:16,661
Well, you're doing it
wrong, then.

319
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:28,686
So is this even, uh, legal?

320
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:34,255
Not that. That's...
That is not even sanitary.

321
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,350
- I mean, living on a... - You're here
to give me a ticket, Quentin?

322
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:42,317
No. No, no, no. And I'm not like your
ewest stalker or anything. I just...

323
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,819
I just can't get that song
out of my head.

324
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:47,740
'Round and 'round and around,
and I'm laying there and I think,

325
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,872
"What it needs is a harmony. "

326
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:52,360
Nothing over the top.
Just simple.

327
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:56,140
And then I think, "If that song is
that good, there have to be others. "

328
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,742
And if there are others,
someone ought to play them.

329
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:01,934
- We could play them.
- Let me stop you right there.

330
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:05,030
I'm not interested.

331
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:08,672
Sure, no. Right. Totally,
I get ahead of myself sometimes.

332
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:11,484
Are there other songs?

333
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:13,504
Thank you for the coffee.

334
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:15,226
Sure.

335
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,709
Just to clarify, you don't want
to play at the Trill again,

Excuse me?

350
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:30,738
You're here every week
for a shower.

351
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:32,817
- Wife pissed at you?
- No.

352
00:32:33,357 --> 00:32:35,243
Nope.
No wife, no kids.

353
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:38,181
Live on a boat.

354
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:41,903
Sexy for everything except
for taking a shower.

355
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:51,924
- Mr. Dick?
- Oh.

356
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:54,054
Ah, sorry, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

357
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:56,608
It's Quentin,
in case you forgot.

358
00:32:57,112 --> 00:33:00,145
I have to put a bell
around your neck.

359
00:33:00,943 --> 00:33:04,908
I missed you the other night.
Kinda held out hope.

360
00:33:09,644 --> 00:33:13,462
- You know, I don't get the
appeal of fishing. - Really.

361
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:16,599
Well, I would imagine that most
activities performed in silence

362
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,780
don't make
much sense to you.

363
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:23,594
Uh, permission
to come aboard?

364
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,539
If I say yes,

365
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:31,283
- you promise to help
with dinner? - Done.

366
00:33:31,314 --> 00:33:33,481
All right.
Here, clean these.

367
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:46,708
Uh...

368
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,921
Mr. Dick, I don't know
if I can do this.

369
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:51,858
Don't call me Mr. Dick.

370
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,663
- Okay, Alard.
- Don't call me Alard either.

371
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:58,265
- Well, if I need to talk to you,
should I just whistle? - Call me Sam.

372
00:33:58,818 --> 00:34:01,179
- Okay, why not?
- Think you can handle that?

373
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:23,217
You never told me if you've written others,
but I'm guessing you have because...

374
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,750
- it doesn't really sound like a first
try kind of tune. - Back to this, huh?

375
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:29,864
What I don't understand is,
you don't write stuff like this

376
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:32,089

people to hear it.

- Just hold on. Hold on.

better than you imagined...

told me to recognize you.

- Aiken, this is Tolly.

really drunk.

this was, uh, your idea.

Quentin.

435

I don't know what
you're talking about.

502
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:32,181
Okay.

503
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:41,094
All right, fine.

504
00:42:41,248 --> 00:42:45,790
Willie plays bass and I think a bass
would really bring the songs to life.

505
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,199
- I'm too old to start a band.
- Start a band?

506
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:50,302
No. I don't...
We're not...

507
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,793
I don't wanna start a band.

508
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,755
I just think a little bass
would make us sound better.

509
00:43:01,149 --> 00:43:03,102
Can we go?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:33,216
- Voilà. Not bad, huh?
- You could even park a car in here.

511
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:43,184
Oh, you like the Lips?

512
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:47,552
Yeah, I like the poster. Where...
Is this your parents' place?

513
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:51,422
No, no. Ruth...
I'm sort of the caretaker.

514
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:54,635
- My apartment's upstairs.
- You from around here?

515
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:57,921
No, not...
Not really.

516
00:43:58,258 --> 00:44:01,787
- Um, do you want a drink? - Well, where
you from? What do your folks do?

517
00:44:01,846 --> 00:44:04,779
It's complicated.
Er, let me see what I got.

518
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:09,981
Got water and a... more water.
Pretty much water.

519
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:14,217
Dude! You killed it, man!
Can you give me a hand?

520
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:17,079
- Hey, did you get the chords
and lyrics? - Yeah, I got 'em.

521
00:44:17,493 --> 00:44:19,332
'Sup Sam!
Good to see you again.

522
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,826
- Yep. Hi, Willie.
- Let me get that piece.

523
00:44:21,984 --> 00:44:23,882
How do you come up
with this shit?

524
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,730
- Oh, they just come to me.
- You write on guitar or keyboard?

525
00:44:27,877 --> 00:44:29,759
Yep, they just come.

526
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,649
'60s Marshall?

527
00:44:35,657 --> 00:44:38,954
- Oh, good eye. You like it?
- Is Chuck Norris a badass?

528
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:42,384
This thing's like new, man.
I mean, crisp.

529
00:44:42,702 --> 00:44:44,567
You must've dropped
some serious cash.

530
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:48,149
- A couple of dollars. You guys ready.
Let's go! - All right, let's do this.

531
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:51,684
So it goes D to B minor.
Sort of circles around a little bit.

532
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,527
- All right, I got that, yeah.
- Bridge goes G major, E minor, B minor...

533
00:44:55,671 --> 00:44:57,038
Yeah. I got it.
It got it.

534
00:44:57,054 --> 00:44:59,678
All right, well, just listen in for a couple
verses and join in when you're ready.

535
00:44:59,832 --> 00:45:01,480
No, I got it.

536
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,378

Think you guys could put together
enough songs to play a full set?

563
00:47:52,226 --> 00:47:54,648
Thinking of making you
a regular on Saturdays.

564
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:56,686
Seriously?

565
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:01,405
- Yeah! - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hey, we only know four songs.

566
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:04,410
Well, we'll do covers.
Yeah, we're in.

567
00:48:05,246 --> 00:48:07,295
Last call, by the way.

568
00:48:07,562 --> 00:48:09,723
That's what I'm
talking about. Yeah!

569
00:48:10,174 --> 00:48:13,367
Hey, guys, guys, guys.
Hey, I already have a job.

570
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:16,362
Oh, well, wouldn't
wanna jeopardize that.

571
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:18,611
Heard you might get
promoted to sanding.

572
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:34,418
Sam?
Sam!

573
00:48:35,408 --> 00:48:38,911
- Alard! Moment of your time?
- Oh, for you, pal? Two.

574
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:43,525
The board has asked me to ask you if
you would consider moving your boat

575
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:45,487
for the regatta.

576
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:48,004
There's a regatta?
I hadn't heard.

577
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:51,980
Can we count on you? This is
the premier event of our season.

578
00:48:52,074 --> 00:48:55,107
We'd like you to anchor on
the south end of the lake.

579
00:48:55,234 --> 00:48:56,651
I'll tell you what.

580
00:48:57,062 --> 00:49:01,615
I'll be on my best behavior if you stop
circulating that petition, or whatever,

581
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:03,840
trying to get me
kicked off the lake.

582
00:49:04,467 --> 00:49:06,484
You think I don't
know about that?

583
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,648
The name's Alaird,
by the way!

584
00:49:12,275 --> 00:49:14,204
I'll move the fucking boat!

585
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,693
- Well? - He's moving the boat.
- All right.

<i>Nah? I guess it's no.</i>

592
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:12,526

00:50:48,515 --> 00:50:50,739
- We thought 'cause...
- No, I get it.

599
00:50:51,502 --> 00:50:54,649
- You know, 'cause your
boat and all. - I get it.

600
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:56,854
- You don't like it.
- No, it's fine.

601
00:50:58,732 --> 00:51:01,478
- Sam hates the name.
- What? No way.

602
00:51:01,735 --> 00:51:03,384
I don't hate the name.

603
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,917
Man, I told you it
was too artsy, bro.

604
00:51:06,036 --> 00:51:08,797

Hey, man, I got a big day tomorrow,
so I'm gonna head home.

637
00:54:14,203 --> 00:54:18,014
You want me to send one of
them over here on my way out?

638
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,195
Come on.

639
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:23,516
Look, I can get my head around
the stage fright, but not this.

640
00:54:25,036 --> 00:54:29,550
They're just hoping to talk to you guys.
This is fish in a barrel.

641
00:54:30,027 --> 00:54:31,584
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

642
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:34,222
- What's the worse that could happen?
- Gee, I don't know.

643
00:54:34,422 --> 00:54:37,115
I think looking like an idiot and
fainting would rank right up there.

644
00:54:37,305 --> 00:54:38,685
Okay, so don't do that.

645
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:40,919
You know,
your advice sucks.

646
00:54:41,246 --> 00:54:43,655
- Does it?
- Oh, yes, yes it does.

647
00:54:44,005 --> 00:54:45,939
Bad. Like, but just
listen to yourself.

648
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:47,944
I say, "I'm nervous. "
You say, "Don't be nervous. "

649
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:49,757
I say, "I feel sick. "
You say, "Don't puke. "

650
00:54:49,884 --> 00:54:52,300
- I say "I don't wanna go over there... "
- Okay, I get it. I get it.

651
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:54,863
All right, well, first listen.

652
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,963
Don't go to hit on them.
Go over to talk to them.

653
00:54:59,102 --> 00:55:02,016
- I just wanna drink my beer.
- No, you don't. - Yeah.

654
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,439
No, no they're
begging to talk to you.

655
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:06,035
So stand up.
Good man. Listen.

656
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:08,815
You're gonna ask them about the show.
A little market research.

657
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,311
See if they like the band.
Okay? Come on.

658
00:55:11,593 --> 00:55:14,632
Look, try to focus on them.
All right?

659
00:55:14,913 --> 00:55:17,577
Go. All right, go.
Have a nice night.

660
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:24,973
- Who's winning?
- Oh, God. He's killin' me, man.

661
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:27,372
I'm yankin' his heart, bro.

662
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:30,813
- Did you just...
- I did. It's kinda cool.

663
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,357
# Rely on your friends
they will get you through

00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:38,602
<i># They're there for you... #
- Hey, Sam!</i>

665
00:55:38,984 --> 00:55:41,331
My kid sister saw you guys. She
thought you guys were excellent!

666
00:55:41,496 --> 00:55:43,332
- What was excellent?
- Your band!

667
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,987
- My band?
- Yeah! Your band.

668
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:50,115
My kid sister saw you guys and
thought you guys were great.

669
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:54,564
Well, yeah, tell her...
Tell her thanks!

670
00:55:54,683 --> 00:55:56,492
<i># Don't let it
get you down</i>

671
00:55:56,738 --> 00:56:01,859
<i># It will bury you, very soon
Oh, yeah #</i>

672
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,917
- Effects pedals?
- Don't judge.

673
00:56:06,198 --> 00:56:07,604
Oh, I wouldn't
dream of it.

674
00:56:07,663 --> 00:56:10,745
- What you lookin' for? - A good loop.
- I wouldn't call any of them good,

675
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,806
but I happen to have some quality
ones to your right there.

676
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:18,956
I don't understand, man.
I just don't understand.

677
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:22,112
Why not play an instrument that
works with the power off?

678
00:56:23,783 --> 00:56:25,614
- Thank you for coming in, Fred.
- Yeah, bye, Del.

679
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:27,444
That's the Korg.
It's very popular.

680
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,255
- If you ask me, the Keeley's better.
- Okay. Sold.

681
00:56:31,669 --> 00:56:33,305
- Big spender?
- Mmm-hmm.

682
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:37,889
You are a godsend, Sam.

683
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:39,461
What?

684
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,786
You know, what you're doing
for that boy.

685
00:56:42,238 --> 00:56:45,188
So, let's see...
I'll give you 20% off of that,

686
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:50,499
so it's gonna be $174.52.

687
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:54,551
We'll call it an even $180.
There ya go.

688
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:00,695
Hey, hey, Sam.

689
00:57:01,112 --> 00:57:03,191
Forgettin' somethin'?

690
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,578
- There you go.
- Okay.

691
00:57:30,437 --> 00:57:32,689
- Did you write that?
- Oh, Jesus.

692
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,765
Haven't you heard
of knocking?

693
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,737
- Is that yours? - Yeah, yeah.
It's not... It's not finished.

694
00:57:40,846 --> 00:57:46,620
- Can I hear it? - No, no. Now is...
Now is not... Not a good time.

695
00:57:46,758 --> 00:57:49,154
Oh, yeah.
You seem really busy.

696
00:57:50,628 --> 00:57:51,987
Oh!

697
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:55,609
- Hi.
- Hey. Hello.

698
00:57:58,465 --> 00:58:00,585
Uh, Joyce,

699
00:58:00,855 --> 00:58:02,449
this is Sam.

700
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,300
- We play in a band together.
- Nice to meet you.

701
00:58:09,317 --> 00:58:10,916
- I should...
- Yeah.

702
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:19,373
Just drive carefully, okay?

703
00:58:25,732 --> 00:58:27,420
Call me sometime.

704
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:29,540
I will.

705
00:58:39,284 --> 00:58:40,884
You wanna go to the mall?

706
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:46,176
Oh, come on. Lighten up, man.
You think I haven't been there?

707
00:58:46,449 --> 00:58:48,099
Been where?

708
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:52,303
Well, you know. Desperate times
call for yada, yada, yada...

709
00:58:53,022 --> 00:58:54,599
You know,
the girls in the Trill.

710
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:58,010
I mean, the phrase "fistful of 20s
in a whorehouse" comes to mind.

711
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:02,878
Joyce is my mom.

712
00:59:11,387 --> 00:59:12,484
<i>Excuse me.</i>

713
00:59:12,691 --> 00:59:16,116
God, sorry.
Quentin, I'm sorry, man.

714
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:17,710
I'm really...

715
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,016
For what it's worth, you have
a very attractive, young mom.

716
00:59:20,282 --> 00:59:22,298
You want me
to set you two up?

717
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:27,840
It's tough when
she shows up.

718
00:59:29,681 --> 00:59:31,753
She's got problems.

719
00:59:32,065 --> 00:59:35,050
My junior year of high school,
we lived out of the car.

720
00:59:35,494 --> 00:59:36,621
Wow.

721
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:38,290
She's better.

722
00:59:38,332 --> 00:59:41,037
But I will never be
that poor again.

723
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:47,891
Seriously?

724
00:59:49,832 --> 00:59:51,899
What do you think
about these?

725
00:59:52,261 --> 00:59:55,286
Man, you're not the least bit
embarrassed to be shopping here?

726
00:59:55,413 --> 00:59:57,588
- Well, I would be, but they're for you.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

727
00:59:57,649 --> 01:00:01,833
Hey, hey, hey.
Style breeds confidence.

728
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:04,420
Sounds like
a bad commercial.

729
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:07,492
That's Leo Burnett.
I didn't do that one.

730
01:00:08,629 --> 01:00:10,886
Here, here you go.
Try those on.

731
01:00:32,855 --> 01:00:34,321
- What? - Stand still.
- What?

732
01:00:34,886 --> 01:00:36,615
What has gotten
into you today?

733
01:00:36,855 --> 01:00:39,176
I gotta admit, you're kinda
freakin' me out, man.

734
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:42,426
And try smiling, okay? You look like
you stepped in a pile of dog shit

735
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,065
and everyone can smell it.

736
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:47,001
Seriously, I'm looking for my
friend Sam, maybe you know him.

737
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:50,162
He's about, oh, yay tall,
he's kind of a dick.

738
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,018
Oh, God.

739
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,330
Come on, stand up straight.
You look like a zombie. Please.

740
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:00,782
You're crushing my soul.
Here we go.

741
01:01:00,935 --> 01:01:03,222
- That's so dramatic!
- Hey, how's it going, girls?

742
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,966
- Oh, God. - We are not drunk enough
to buy what you're selling.

743
01:01:07,106 --> 01:01:09,771
Wow, hey! Does it look like I'm
trying to sell you something?

744
01:01:09,936 --> 01:01:11,667
- Yes. - Yeah. Absolutely.
- Pretty much.

745
01:01:11,729 --> 01:01:13,311
No, fair enough.
Listen, I just wanted to see

746
01:01:13,425 --> 01:01:15,290
if you guys were going to
stay for the band.

747
01:01:15,851 --> 01:01:17,389
We have to work early.

748
01:01:17,892 --> 01:01:20,683
- No. What do you do?
- Teach third grade. - First grade.

749
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,528
Oh, wow, teachin'
on Sundays now, huh?

750
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:27,293
Um...

751
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:32,956
- Is the band any good? - Well, I like
to think so, but I'm a bit biased.

752
01:01:33,277 --> 01:01:35,391
I'm Sam and that's Quentin. Q.

753
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:37,286
- You're in the band?
- Watch it.

754
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,064
That really hurts.
What?

755
01:01:42,749 --> 01:01:44,467
I play guitar.

756
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:47,105
I'm April.

757
01:01:47,518 --> 01:01:48,558
I'm Lizzie.

758
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,632
April and Lizzie, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna make another round here,

759
01:01:51,785 --> 01:01:53,961
see if I can drum up some more
people to stay for the show.

760
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:56,060
You keep my friend here
company and we'll play

761
01:01:56,399 --> 01:01:59,134
whatever song you
want to open with.

762
01:01:59,304 --> 01:02:00,875
- Any song?
- You name it.

763
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,808
<i>Paparazzi.</i>

764
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,621
- Lady Gaga.
- I know.

765
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,380
- Bullshit!
- You did not know!

766
01:02:07,398 --> 01:02:09,191
All right,
give me one more chance.

767
01:02:42,923 --> 01:02:47,171
<i># The wheels on the bus go

- Let's pick up some stuff to make
margaritas. - Good idea.

793
01:03:59,646 --> 01:04:01,174
Can we stop on the way?

794
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:03,265
Hey, that was awesome.

795
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:05,708
- Oh, good. Thank you.
- See you over there, man.

796
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:09,136
Hey, you need a ride?

797
01:04:09,273 --> 01:04:12,231
- No. Imma ride my bike. I'll meet you
over there. - Okay, all right. - Okay.

798
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,358
What kind of car is this?
Is this safe?

799
01:04:15,661 --> 01:04:17,566
Yeah, we can
all ride up front.

800
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:36,022
- Hi. - "Rudderless" rocks!
- Yeah!

801
01:04:36,805 --> 01:04:38,836
You just see the show?

802
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,091
You don't remember me,
do you?

803
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,185
- Were you sitting at the bar?
- I'm Kate Lucas.

804
01:04:44,654 --> 01:04:48,237
We've already met,
in Josh's room.

805
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,004
Oh, my God.

806
01:04:53,279 --> 01:04:55,085
It's been better lately.

807
01:04:55,473 --> 01:04:59,825
Things have died down. I even go
out sometimes, like tonight.

808
01:05:00,277 --> 01:05:03,708
- Oh, Kate. - I go by Ann now.
It's my middle name.

809
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:06,308
So you're a rock
star now, huh?

810
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:09,296
Except you didn't write
those songs, did you?

811
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:12,226
- Listen... - How could
you play those songs?

812
01:05:12,244 --> 01:05:13,942
Shame on you!

813
01:05:49,161 --> 01:05:50,434
Hey, Sam!

814
01:07:03,488 --> 01:07:05,530
I was not expecting this.

815
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,245
Oh!

816
01:07:07,959 --> 01:07:10,783
- Shit. Hey.
- I have to stay ahead of it.

817
01:07:11,755 --> 01:07:17,412
Paint thinner's the only thing that...
But it's hell on your hands.

818
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,320
Tequila?

819
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:28,464
Yeah, I thought it was a good
choice for the occasion.

820
01:08:19,503 --> 01:08:21,367
Happy birthday, Josh.

821
01:08:21,605 --> 01:08:23,494
Happy birthday, Josh.

822
01:08:26,525 --> 01:08:29,075
I think for mothers and daughters,
it's sweet 16.

823
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,821
For fathers and sons, it's 21.

824
01:08:33,807 --> 01:08:35,824
Was I always
such an asshole?

825
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,110
You really grew
into it, though.

826
01:08:40,775 --> 01:08:42,688
Was I always the ice queen?

827
01:08:42,854 --> 01:08:45,606
There were some
notable thaws.

828
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:52,783
I had breakfast with
one of the moms.

829
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:56,150
She wanted to talk,
to forgive Josh...

830
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,843
- Eh. - She didn't blame us.
It was amazing.

831
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:00,553
- Don't. Don't.
- It was like a weight lifting.

832
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:02,602
I've been thinking about
reaching out to the others.

833
01:09:02,809 --> 01:09:04,426
- I'd like you to do it with...
- You know what, I should go.

834
01:09:04,644 --> 01:09:07,018
- It wasn't our fault. - You think I
don't know it wasn't our fault?

835
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:09,984
- I don't know, Sam. I don't know what
you think! - Hey, are you okay to drive?

836
01:09:10,321 --> 01:09:11,967
We did everything right.

837
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,799
We did everything we could.
Josh was sick.

838
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:17,530
You might want to dwell on this,
but I don't.

839
01:09:18,302 --> 01:09:20,702
What does it matter?
His fault, your fault, my fault.

840
01:09:20,877 --> 01:09:22,524
Who cares?

841
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:25,108
I don't need to ask
for anybody's forgiveness.

842
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:28,274
And I sure as fuck don't need
to meet any of the parents!

843
01:09:40,215 --> 01:09:43,573
<i># Stop staring</i>

844
01:09:45,494 --> 01:09:48,957

845
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:39,030
Man, you look like shit.

846
01:10:39,563 --> 01:10:42,177
Well, hard to look better
than a man in uniform.

847
01:10:42,181 --> 01:10:43,892
Must have been
one hell of a weekend.

848
01:10:44,124 --> 01:10:46,740
You know, me and Earl caught the Crimson
and Cream game on Saturday.

849
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:49,063
- Sounds like fun.
- Nah.

850
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,736
Okay, I'm gonna grab
some more water.

851
01:11:12,428 --> 01:11:14,153
What the hell you doin'?

852
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:17,809
Well, most people
call it a nap.

853
01:11:18,184 --> 01:11:21,800
In fact, in some cultures it's considered
a real boost to productivity.

854
01:11:22,131 --> 01:11:24,705
- You're fired, smart guy.
- Well, if it weren't sad,

855
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:30,198
it'd be kind of endearing that you don't
realize I quit about an hour ago.

856
01:11:33,525 --> 01:11:37,926
- Whoo! - I keep trying to get Sam to go.
- Oh, he will. On the deck!

857
01:11:38,269 --> 01:11:40,168
- Yeah, yeah. He's not into it.
I don't know why. - Damn!

858
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:45,306
- Look at this boat you have, man.
- I'm gonna be really disappointed.

859
01:11:45,645 --> 01:11:48,292
- Like, terribly upset.
- Naw, I'm just kiddin'.

860
01:11:53,123 --> 01:11:55,979
- Permission to come aboard?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,922
I know. I mean, seriously,
man, it's that good.

862
01:12:14,256 --> 01:12:16,853
I mean, sooner or later
someone's gonna sign us.

863
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:20,629
- "Real Friends" is a hit. - We do a
regional tour and we're set.

864
01:12:20,773 --> 01:12:22,421
You really think so?

865
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:26,139
- Fuck, yeah, dude. And we're talking
eight to 10 a night. - No way, dude.

866
01:12:26,454 --> 01:12:30,052
- Yeah. Thousand? - You're not
making donuts anymore, man.

867
01:12:32,604 --> 01:12:35,932

872
01:12:57,819 --> 01:12:59,251
Oh, fuck
What?

873
01:12:59,763 --> 01:13:01,791
I'm not gonna beat around
the bush, or pussy foot.

874
01:13:02,022 --> 01:13:05,876
I think the best thing to do is say it...
Like a Band-Aid. Quick and...

875
01:13:06,223 --> 01:13:09,456
Well, not really painless because
usually that hurts. But what I mean is...

876
01:13:09,534 --> 01:13:11,357
We were asked to play
the BUZZ 104 Block Party.

877
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,074
Look, we've been more
than cool, man.

878
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,939
You only want
to play Saturdays, fine.

879
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,371
You don't want to play other bars,
okay, we can swallow that for now,

880
01:13:17,622 --> 01:13:19,439
- but this is big, man. You owe us.
- Dude, dude, dude.

881
01:13:19,765 --> 01:13:21,895
Wilco. Death Cab, radio promos.

882
01:13:22,071 --> 01:13:24,822
Do you know what this could mean, dude?
This could be the first step.

883
01:13:24,837 --> 01:13:26,980
I mean, I don't wanna think
about the audience. Yes, I do.

884
01:13:27,226 --> 01:13:29,356
But if Ben Gibbard
digs it, who knows?

885
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:32,380
Yeah, they want us to play
15 minutes, three songs or so.

886
01:13:32,498 --> 01:13:34,583
You can do this
one thing for us.

887
01:13:34,629 --> 01:13:39,800
Guys, I know I'm dragging,
but it's... complicated.

888
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:42,463
I should think about it.

889
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:45,203
There's nothing to think about, man.
We need this, Sam.

890
01:13:45,374 --> 01:13:47,870
I need to think about it.

891
01:13:50,783 --> 01:13:54,866
<i>All right, easy. Stop! There's a pole!
I know there's a pole back there!</i>

892
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,312
- I can see the damn pole.
- There's a gas thing up there!

893
01:13:57,347 --> 01:14:00,193
Don't tell me what to do, I can drive!
I've been drivin' all my damn life.

894
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:02,868
- Just a little bit, just a little bit.
Stop! - Son of a bitch!

895
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:05,632
Hey, come on, come on.
Comin' back, comin' back!

896
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:08,471
You must be Tina.
And you must be Sam.

897
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:10,252
Who are you talkin' to?
What are you...

898
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,779
Are you help,
are you gonna help me?

899
01:14:11,963 --> 01:14:15,522
- Well, that is a big sucker.
- Watch it! - Has its own zip code.

900
01:14:15,959 --> 01:14:18,105
- Stop!
- What? Motherfuckin'...

901
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:20,254
Let me see if I can...
I wouldn't...

902
01:14:20,391 --> 01:14:22,081
Son of a bitch!
All right.

903
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,857
Man. Did... Did you try...
You're... Can you...

904
01:14:34,892 --> 01:14:37,273
- You need to cut it a bit...
- Yeah, yeah. Tried that twice.

905
01:14:38,526 --> 01:14:41,581
You know, I'm not too old to whoop
yo' ass if you start laughin', yeah?

906
01:14:41,806 --> 01:14:44,223
I would not think of that.
Did you buy this?

907
01:14:44,858 --> 01:14:46,007
Test drive.

908
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:51,011
Oh, oh, all right. Oh, yeah, hold on.
Hold on.

909
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:53,652
Wait a minute.
Go ahead, keep laughing.

910
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:55,554
So it's funny now.

911
01:14:57,748 --> 01:15:00,266
Go ahead and laugh it up!
Keep laughin', both of you!

912
01:15:00,354 --> 01:15:04,229
Ha-ha-ha! Yeah, as long as I'm
here to amuse you.

913
01:15:04,729 --> 01:15:06,359
- I told you so.
- Come on, Sam.

914
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:09,332
Sooner I can get you what you need,
the sooner I'm done with you.

915
01:15:09,494 --> 01:15:11,372
Hey, can I give it a shot?

916
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,672
All right, you get it out
without a scratch,

917
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,640
I'll give you whatever
you came for for free.

918
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:24,208
Come on, Tina,
don't help him.

919
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:30,736
- I got it! - You did not.
You're full of shit!

920
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:35,004
Have you got one of these?

921
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:36,467
I do.

922
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:40,034
I packed those tubes away.
I know where they are.

923
01:15:40,186 --> 01:15:42,942
- Nice to finally meet you, Sam.
- And you, too, Tina.

924
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:53,368
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mmm.

925
01:15:54,943 --> 01:15:57,046
How come you're not playing
the gig on Saturday?

926
01:15:57,348 --> 01:16:00,735
- How do you know about that?
- Shit, that's all I do know about.

927
01:16:00,996 --> 01:16:03,586
If Q ain't in here asking me to play
the damn guitar, I got to hear him

928
01:16:03,614 --> 01:16:05,590
runnin' his mouth about how
you ain't playing the gig.

929
01:16:05,635 --> 01:16:08,429
Well, I never said I wasn't going to play
the gig. I said I had to think about it.

930
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:11,527
What's there to think about?
You're a band. It's a gig.

931
01:16:11,726 --> 01:16:15,509
- They're not that easy to come by.
- I need to think about it, though.

932
01:16:15,753 --> 01:16:18,761
I'm just... I'm too old
for this shit, man.

933
01:16:19,872 --> 01:16:21,074
Wow.

934
01:16:21,499 --> 01:16:23,311
What you talkin' about,
too old?

935
01:16:23,364 --> 01:16:27,354
T - Bone Walker played till he was 77.
Died with a guitar in his hand.

936
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,507
Well, I don't want to die
with a guitar in my hand.

937
01:16:29,748 --> 01:16:31,459
Then what you
doin' in a band?

938
01:16:31,942 --> 01:16:34,268
Beginning to wonder
that myself.

939
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:38,525
- Hey, Slim!
- Hey.

940
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:40,695
So what's up with that
"for sale" sign in the window?

941
01:16:40,806 --> 01:16:42,536
Yeah, man. Puttin' the
business up for sale.

942
01:16:42,771 --> 01:16:44,546
- Me and Tina are gonna do
some traveling. - Oh, really?

943
01:16:44,815 --> 01:16:46,806
Take a look around.
See somethin' you like, let me know.

956
01:17:32,698 --> 01:17:35,831

- When was the meeting where we made

957
01:17:35,925 --> 01:17:38,574
you lord and master of the band?
'Cause I think I missed it.

958
01:17:39,807 --> 01:17:42,558
- It's the only way I'll do the show.
- It's a good song.

959
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:45,005
Makes me nervous to agree
with Sam, but he's right.

960
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:47,877
So it's settled.

961
01:17:48,457 --> 01:17:50,590
- Count it off.
- Let's do it.

962
01:18:02,881 --> 01:18:05,305
Fine with me, I didn't wanna
play that show anyway.

963
01:18:05,615 --> 01:18:07,185
Ah, come on, Q.

964
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:09,390
- Come on, bro. - Okay, okay, okay.
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

965
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:12,131
All right, fine.
We'll play the fucking song.

966
01:18:13,997 --> 01:18:15,372
It's a good song.

967
01:18:15,744 --> 01:18:17,675

Tonight when everyone
is cheering for those songs,

979
01:19:23,188 --> 01:19:25,147
how are you gonna
feel about that?

980
01:19:25,186 --> 01:19:28,628
This whole thing, this fantasy you're
living in, it's... it's impressive.

981
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:31,107
- Kate... - Ann.
It's Ann, remember?

982
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:34,333
- Ann, please. - Do you even know
why I changed my name?

983
01:19:34,668 --> 01:19:36,517
Because they kept calling me.

984
01:19:36,592 --> 01:19:37,941
What kind of sex
did we have?

985
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:40,246
Did we have a cult?
How many were there?

986
01:19:40,535 --> 01:19:43,070
I had to quit school.
Josh ruined my life.

987
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,957
- That's what your son did to me.
- I'm so sorry. - Sorry?

988
01:19:46,242 --> 01:19:48,021
Know what?
I should thank you.

989
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:51,710
I think I'm finally finished
with you and your son.

990
01:20:11,211 --> 01:20:12,867
Is it true?

991
01:20:14,507 --> 01:20:15,964
Yeah.

992
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:22,673
Today is really not turning out
like I thought it would.

993
01:20:23,072 --> 01:20:24,879
I should have told you.

994
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:26,934
You think?

995
01:20:27,021 --> 01:20:29,951
Dude, we can still play the show, man.
Think about it. - We're only doing

996
01:20:29,966 --> 01:20:32,375
- three songs, one of them's yours.
Yours is the best one. - Guys...

997
01:20:32,742 --> 01:20:34,557
- Yeah, I don't know what she
told you... - You need this.

998
01:20:34,601 --> 01:20:37,895
After tonight we stop playing 'em forever,
and we never play 'em again.

999
01:20:38,146 --> 01:20:40,052
No one's the wiser,
but we don't miss this chance.

1000
01:20:40,188 --> 01:20:42,045
- No one would know.
- I would know.

1001
01:20:42,332 --> 01:20:44,395
Playing these songs is wrong.

1002
01:20:44,796 --> 01:20:46,621
It's wrong.

1003
01:20:50,923 --> 01:20:52,706
Isn't it, Sam?

1004
01:20:55,587 --> 01:20:57,093
It's wrong.

1005
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:00,363
All right,
I'm gettin' my stuff.

1006
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:03,298
Q, please, man.
Seriously, think about this.

1007
01:21:03,404 --> 01:21:04,186
Come on, bro.

1008
01:21:04,535 --> 01:21:06,673
Pack up the rest
of my shit, all right?

1009
01:21:06,976 --> 01:21:08,465
You screwed us, Sam.

1010
01:21:08,729 --> 01:21:10,178
He was...
He was my son.

1011
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:12,656
Yeah, and you must have
been a hell of a father.

1012
01:21:12,761 --> 01:21:13,827
Listen.

1013
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:20,749
Shit.

1014
01:21:39,823 --> 01:21:40,779
What are you havin'?

1015
01:21:41,324 --> 01:21:43,529
Whiskey.
Neat.

1016
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,190
Double it up for me, will ya?

1017
01:22:08,483 --> 01:22:09,955
Well, fuck you.

1018
01:22:30,855 --> 01:22:32,342
Oh, fuck.

1019
01:22:41,595 --> 01:22:42,971
Oh, fuck!

1020
01:22:51,947 --> 01:22:53,274
Hell, no.

1021
01:23:00,411 --> 01:23:01,906
Oh, no, buddy.

1022
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:28,308
Fuck.
Fuck.

1023
01:23:34,131 --> 01:23:35,429
Fuck.

1024
01:23:41,293 --> 01:23:42,732
What the fuck?

1025
01:23:54,619 --> 01:23:56,385
Shut the fuck up!

1026
01:23:59,131 --> 01:24:00,876
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1027
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:04,653
<i>the annual Lake Channing
Summer Regatta is underway!</i>

1028
01:24:13,745 --> 01:24:16,394
<i>...beginning at 2:00.
And the silent auction...</i>

1029
01:24:16,573 --> 01:24:18,748
Okay, a little to the right!
Nice.

1030
01:24:18,997 --> 01:24:21,403
- Nice.
- Looks great, guys.

1031
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:23,433
Hey.
Do you see that?

1032
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,107
That's it.
You hear that?

1033
01:24:30,869 --> 01:24:31,950
Hey, check it out!

1034
01:24:32,209 --> 01:24:34,544
What the hell
is he doing?

1035
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:47,534
- Look! - Bring it around!
- Break left! Tag left!

1036
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,586
- Get away!
- God, what is he doing?

1037
01:24:53,953 --> 01:24:55,257
Break off!

1038
01:24:55,521 --> 01:24:56,908
What a jerk!

1039
01:25:03,873 --> 01:25:05,269
You're a jerk!

1040
01:25:15,408 --> 01:25:17,526
I'm gonna remember
your face, douche.

1041
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,738
What's wrong with you?

1042
01:25:20,261 --> 01:25:21,468
What are you doing?

1043
01:25:21,755 --> 01:25:24,269
What the hell do
think you're doing?

1044
01:25:31,415 --> 01:25:32,757
I'm over here.

1045
01:25:34,044 --> 01:25:38,056
I'm sorry it's so late, I...
I didn't have anyone else to call.

1046
01:25:57,048 --> 01:25:58,906
You remember the
university shootings

1047
01:25:58,927 --> 01:26:01,407
at Smythe Library
a couple of years ago?

1048
01:26:01,434 --> 01:26:04,149
Yeah. You talkin'
about your boy, huh?

1049
01:26:06,204 --> 01:26:08,716
Oh, yeah, I recognized you when
you first came into the shop.

1050
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:12,352
Just took me a minute
to figure out where from.

1051
01:26:12,618 --> 01:26:14,144
Well, then,
you know my story.

1052
01:26:14,404 --> 01:26:17,151
No. I don't know your story, man.
All I know is what I read.

1053
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,720
What would you say
if I told you that...

1054
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:30,962
my son wrote all the songs
the band plays?

1055
01:26:34,036 --> 01:26:35,125
Damn.

1056
01:26:36,392 --> 01:26:38,520
I'd say, "I didn't
see that comin'. "

1057
01:26:39,732 --> 01:26:42,338
- Wait, does Quentin know?
- He does now.

1058
01:26:42,676 --> 01:26:44,505
Oh, yeah?
How'd he take it?

1059
01:26:45,011 --> 01:26:47,665
- There ya go.
- Well, I can't say as I blame him.

1060
01:26:47,971 --> 01:26:50,251
Damn! Your boy wrote
all that music?

1061
01:26:50,452 --> 01:26:52,502
Well, what were
you thinking?

1062
01:26:55,057 --> 01:26:57,437
- He was my son. - They were
all somebody's sons, Sam.

1063
01:26:57,654 --> 01:27:01,245
- Somebody's sons, somebody's daughters.
Your boy killed them. - I know, but...

1064
01:27:03,546 --> 01:27:05,738
but he was my son.

1065
01:27:10,629 --> 01:27:15,643
Well, I can't say I know half of
what you've been through, man.

1066
01:27:15,895 --> 01:27:19,395
But...
Quentin deserves better.

1067
01:27:24,503 --> 01:27:26,207
I know.

1068
01:28:22,956 --> 01:28:24,076
My little boy.

1069
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:29,831
My boy, my boy.

1070
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:33,871
My boy.
Oh, my boy.

1071
01:28:34,128 --> 01:28:35,834
My boy...

1072
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:21,302
- You okay?
- No. Not yet.

1073
01:29:23,599 --> 01:29:25,413
- What are you doin' here?
- I...

1074
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:29,691
I think someday, Phillip's gonna wanna
know who his brother really was,

1075
01:29:29,932 --> 01:29:31,902
or just what he's
going to read.

1076
01:29:31,937 --> 01:29:34,942
And when that happens,
I think you should give him these.

1077
01:29:38,713 --> 01:29:39,978
Wait.

1078
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,351
Just listen.

1079
01:29:59,182 --> 01:30:01,458
Thought you played
that old Epiphone.

1080
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,020
Not anymore.

1081
01:30:07,606 --> 01:30:09,903
I just wanted
to come by and...

1082
01:30:10,617 --> 01:30:12,753
And say thanks.

1083
01:30:13,172 --> 01:30:16,261
No need, man.
Not even a little bit.

1084
01:30:16,913 --> 01:30:18,328
Okay.

1085
01:30:18,902 --> 01:30:23,306
- Okay. - Are those Quentin's guitars?
- Yeah. Stubborn little bastard.

1086
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:26,000
I told him I'm damn near givin'
things away around here, but,

1087
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:29,966
he won't take no for an answer.
Wants me to sell 'em on consignment.

1088
01:30:31,822 --> 01:30:33,327
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1089
01:30:35,558 --> 01:30:39,756
Oh, I forgot to ask.
How's this goin'?

1090
01:30:39,979 --> 01:30:41,363
Got an offer.

1091
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:43,525
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1092
01:30:44,785 --> 01:30:46,209
Well...

1093
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:51,581
You take care of yourself.

1094
01:30:54,076 --> 01:30:55,617
- Okay.
- All right.

1095
01:31:06,344 --> 01:31:07,906
A good offer?

1096
01:31:16,496 --> 01:31:19,615
Heard the donuts in here
are better than sex.

1097
01:31:21,992 --> 01:31:24,184
You're doin' it wrong, then.

1098
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:31,200
- Can we talk?
- I'm kind of behind here.

1099
01:31:32,023 --> 01:31:35,557
Okay. Guess I need to
order something then, huh?

1100
01:31:37,776 --> 01:31:40,297
- What are those?
- Cherry.

1101
01:31:42,508 --> 01:31:43,968
That one?

1102
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:46,230
Blueberry fritter.

1103
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:54,943
That first night that we
got up there and played,

1104
01:31:56,366 --> 01:32:01,851
it was like I got to meet
a Josh that I never knew.

1105
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:05,789
And every new song we played,
I learned more about him.

1106
01:32:05,858 --> 01:32:07,097
It was intoxicating.

1107
01:32:07,328 --> 01:32:09,714
I couldn't stop.
I didn't wanna stop, but,

1108
01:32:10,766 --> 01:32:13,841
it wasn't Josh.

1109
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:18,863
It was you.

1110
01:32:19,819 --> 01:32:21,885
Oh, my God, Quentin.

1111
01:32:22,133 --> 01:32:24,619
I am so sorry.

1112
01:32:24,903 --> 01:32:28,775
The last thing I ever wanted to do was
fuck up another young man's life.

1113
01:32:28,786 --> 01:32:30,643
Is that what you think?

1114
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,600
Well, you can let yourself
off the hook for that one.

1115
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:36,587
I've been fuckin' up
my life for 21 years, man.

1116
01:32:36,814 --> 01:32:38,111
Then stop.

1117
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:41,481
Stop fucking it up.

1118
01:32:41,692 --> 01:32:45,868
Keep going. You don't need those
songs. You don't need me.

1119
01:32:46,235 --> 01:32:48,705
I want you to keep going.
I want you to write songs.

1120
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:50,290
I want you to make music.

1121
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:53,579
Don't give up
because of me.

1122
01:32:53,905 --> 01:32:55,574
Quitters never win.

1123
01:32:57,441 --> 01:32:59,216
"Quitters never win"?

1124
01:32:59,608 --> 01:33:03,864
Is that seriously the best you've got?
"Quitters never win"?

1125
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:06,015
I... I...

1126
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:16,720
That's the best I got.

1127
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:19,787
Quitters never win.

1128
01:33:55,277 --> 01:33:56,728
Hmm.

1129
01:34:18,443 --> 01:34:21,450
