1
00:00:47,942 --> 00:00:52,338
<i>My Dear Holmes, today I walked
14 miles across rough terrain</i>

2
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:55,675
<i>and hardly a twinge from
either my leg or my shoulder.</i>

3
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,637
<i>The landscape is as handsome
as it is reported.</i>

4
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:04,433
<i>I still entertain the hope that
I can prevail upon you to join me.</i>

5
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:09,021
<i>I appreciate, of course that the
beauties of nature mean little to you,</i>

6
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,193
<i>but I believe you would have found some
of the guests at my hotel most intriguing.</i>

7
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:21,450
<i>Moral splendor is on display in the
person of the striking Major Shlessinger,</i>

8
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,536
<i>a hero of the Boer War,</i>

9
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:28,666
<i>sadly crippled in the defense of Ladysmith
and now engaged in charitable work.</i>

10
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:33,796
<i>His nurse is a Miss Calder
whose attentiveness suggests not only</i>

11
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:38,968
<i>that she is his disciple but also
that tenderer feelings may be involved.</i>

12
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,265
<i>Most fascinating of all, however,
is an extraordinary woman,</i>

13
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:47,560
<i>one who would stand out
in any society,</i>

14
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:50,938
<i>the Lady Frances Carfax.</i>

15
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:54,483
<i>I suppose one would call her modern</i>

16
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,904
<i>except that she seems to come from
an ancient line of English eccentrics.</i>

17
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:02,616
<i>Yesterday, as if to confirm
the general opinion of her oddity,</i>

18
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:07,121
<i>she declared that she would sail herself
to church across the lake.</i>

19
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,454
<i>There was much speculation
in the hotel carriage</i>

20
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,916
<i>as we traveled towards the charming
little lakeside chapel</i>

21
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:55,461
<i>about whether Lady Frances
would be as good as her word.</i>

22
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:58,798
<i>And those of us foolish enough to
doubt her were soon rebuked</i>

23
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,592
<i>by the sight of a skiff moored
in the shallows</i>

24
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:05,679
<i>and by the stern gaze of its captain
when she greeted us within.</i>

25
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:15,606
A surprisingly jolly sermon, Vicar,
I laughed like a cat.

26
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:20,820
<i>Well, she appears to care not a jot
what her fellow guests make of her</i>

27
00:03:20,886 --> 00:03:23,405
<i>and seems quite insensible to
the vivid impression</i>

28
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:25,658
<i>she creates wherever she goes.</i>

29
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:35,668
<i>We were all amused, certainly, at the
sight of her trying to board the skiff,</i>

30
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:39,296
<i>but since she had accomplished
the outward journey with such skill,</i>

31
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:42,508
<i>we had no reason to suppose
that her return voyage</i>

32
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,677
<i>would present her with
any greater difficulty,</i>

33
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:48,222
<i>or that it would end
in the way that it did.</i>

34
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:16,584
<i>I had decided to
walk back across the fill</i>

35
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,169
<i>so I was not amongst
those who waited</i>

36
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:20,504
<i>to cheer Lady Frances
on her return.</i>

37
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,464
<i>I arrived a little later</i>

38
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,218
<i>at exactly the moment when
tragedy threatened to strike.</i>

39
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,262
Help!

40
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:32,683
Help, here!

41
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:38,772
Help!

42
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:43,986
I was helpless, my dear Holmes,
helpless.

43
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:48,199
I have never felt so powerless
in my life,

44
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:52,328
as powerless, so I thought,
as the old soldier in his wheelchair

45
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,247
who had only been able to shout,
it seemed, for help.

46
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:59,418
As with many men, I have noticed
a weakness in one part of the body

47
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:02,755
is compensated by
great strength elsewhere.

48
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,217
Unable to walk,

49
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:10,054
Shlessinger was yet able to swim
powerfully with his arms alone.

50
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:21,106
Reinforcements arrived in
due course from the hotel,

51
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:24,610
and tragedy was happily averted.

52
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,946
Now, all parties are recovered,

53
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:31,158
it is reported that the Lady Frances
is resentful of her rescue

54
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:35,537
as if her suffragette principles
had been somehow compromised.

55
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:40,834
All agree at any rate that Major
Shlessinger is the hero of the hour.

56
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:47,007
Miss Calder's attentions are now
translated into patent adoration.

57
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,135
No doubt further praise
will be in order

58
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:53,847
when he lectures on his missionary
activities at the hotel tomorrow.

59
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,643
He is, by the way,
the British representative of

60
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,229
the Mission Church of
Christ the Healer

61
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:03,941
whose theater works
in the high Andes of Peru.

62
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:14,618
Morning.

63
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,833
Major Shlessinger is avoiding me.

64
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,169
The poor man is embarrassed by
his own heroism.

65
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:28,590
Perhaps he now thinks I'm obliged to
contribute to his work.

66
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:33,012
Men have such extraordinary
weaknesses.

67
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,805
Don't you think?

68
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:39,226
Oh, yes, certainly, we do,
of course, I agree.

69
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:44,106
Would you care to take a turn
by the lake, Doctor?

70
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:03,375
Major Shlessinger works tirelessly
for his church, does he not?

71
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:07,588
I understand the need for
funds is considerable.

72
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,799
He's lecturing on his cause
tomorrow here in the hotel

73
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:12,092
hoping to raise some money.

74
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,469
He'll do well.

75
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:16,431
The local matronage will happily part
with half a guinea each

76
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:20,059
for the company of such a man
albeit in public.

77
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,853
Do I shock you?

78
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,146
Not at all.

79
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:25,731
I shock my brother.

80
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:29,777
As the Earl of Rufton, I think
he feels it is his duty to be shocked.

81
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,572
Oh, it's very beautiful here,
isn't it?

82
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:39,286
I spent every summer of
my childhood here by this lake.

83
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:43,248
It's very beautiful.

84
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:44,792
It is indeed.

85
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,254
He's to visit me tomorrow.

86
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:51,924
- Who?
- My brother.

87
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,218
That is duty, too, of course.

88
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:58,972
Damn him.

89
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,101
Damn him!

90
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,456
Ah, Lady Frances!

91
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,835
What a pleasant surprise!

92
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:33,424
<i>I must confess that her behaviour
continues to fascinate me.</i>

93
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:38,762
<i>I grant that her reaction to this
unknown horseman was extreme,</i>

94
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,223
<i>but many of her reactions are.</i>

95
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:43,809
<i>Had she known him, I wonder?</i>

96
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:47,980
<i>What lies in her past to
prompt this fear of him?</i>

97
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,732
<i>In looking for an explanation,</i>

98
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:53,694
<i>I am placing some hopes in the visit
we expect this afternoon</i>

99
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,280
<i>from her brother, the Earl of Rufton.</i>

100
00:08:57,056 --> 00:09:00,284
<i>By all accounts, his oddities are
of an entirely different order</i>

101
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,077
<i>from those of his sister.</i>

102
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,288
<i>Where she flouts convention,</i>

103
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:08,667
<i>he has raised the conventions of
a former era to the status of a faith.</i>

104
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:14,256
<i>As for myself, I notice
an increasing indifference</i>

105
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,758
<i>to the natural beauty
which lies about me.</i>

106
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:20,971
<i>My thoughts return constantly
to the Lady Frances.</i>

107
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:25,309
<i>There is something about her life
which prompts my sympathy, some-</i>

108
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:29,521
<i>unhappiness I can sense
which I would dearly like to dispel.</i>

109
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:34,526
<i>It is to be hoped that her spirits
will be lifted by her brother's visit,</i>

110
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:38,947
<i>for she remains subdued
from yesterday's strange encounter.</i>

111
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,118
<i>Who is he, Holmes?</i>

112
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:46,705
<i>Why does he not wish
to make himself known?</i>

113
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:53,045
Why indeed?

114
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:17,444
Watson, you're a brick,

115
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:22,032
I came here, Fanny, to see how
you were, not to be lectured.

116
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,493
It's not a lecture,
it's a request.

117
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,618
It sounds like a lecture.

118
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:26,703
It's quite simple,
I need some money.

119
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:27,955
Just like that?

120
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,707
I suppose you've been overdoing it
again, haven't you?

121
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:32,668
I do not "overdo" it, John.

122
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:35,754
If I have ever overspent the wretched
allowance you give me,

123
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,548
it's because someone
has been in need.

124
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:40,551
Oh, yes,
your famous heart of gold,

125
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:43,178
except that it's my money
and there isn't any.

126
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:46,932
You know perfectly well there isn't.
The hall is falling to bits.

127
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,602
There's a family of owls
in the East Wing and you think...

128
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:56,108
What is it this time?
Helping penniless poets in Islington?

129
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:58,986
You only know how to be cruel,
don't you?

130
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:01,613
When have you ever cared for
what I want?

131
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:04,950
The last 15 years of my life
have been wretched.

132
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,160
And now, at last, I had a chance

133
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:10,122
to make something of it. Doesn't that
have any meaning for you?

134
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:21,049
Good afternoon.

135
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:26,305
The difference it makes is that
I'm being told what to do.

136
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,806
You know I loathe it.

137
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:30,216
The trouble is you won't even
take advice, will you?

138
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,520
You've been offered everything.
You've turned it all down.

139
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:35,647
- What have I been offered?
- Marriage. Good marriages.

140
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:41,403
To be the unpaid slave of
a titled yokel

141
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:43,030
who hasn't even read a book,

142
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,699
who thinks Bach is
something terriers do?

143
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:47,659
All right, all right.

144
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:50,495
What have you got against
me doing this? What?

145
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,000
I want to get out of this
miserable mess my life is in,

146
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,337
to be my own woman,
for God's sake,

147
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:02,382
to fulfill just a portion of my life.

148
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:05,886
Why do you always hold me back?

149
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:11,016
Think of it, John, think of it.

150
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,019
Just one payment. One.

151
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,229
You could see the back
of me forever.

152
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:20,400
The mule express,
as we have dubbed it,

153
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:23,695
brings the mail once a month,
letters, of course,

154
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:26,907
and food for the mind from
the Library of Christ.

155
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:30,369
And medicines for
the well being of my flock

156
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:35,582
whom you may see here
posing outside the mission

157
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,501
below a temporary belfry.

158
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:40,504
When I show you the next picture

159
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,423
of a leading member
of my congregation,

160
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:47,552
you will understand how the parable
of the shepherd and the lost sheep

161
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,513
has become transmuted
in our teaching

162
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:52,766
into that of the llama herd
and the lost llama.

163
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:57,521
And finally, our church.

164
00:12:58,046 --> 00:13:02,359
Humble as it is rough
and poor indeed,

165
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,319
I'm proud to tell you that
the word of God

166
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:07,739
is preached as fervently
within its walls

167
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,992
and is as joyously received there

168
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:14,079
as in any great cathedral
here at home.

169
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:28,635
Thank you, thank you.
It was inspiring as I predicted.

170
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:32,139
I regret to say that
the rigours of his itinerary

171
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:34,725
press hard upon Major Shlessinger

172
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,602
who will shortly be departing
for Whitehaven.

173
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:39,354
We shall be taking up a collection

174
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,649
on behalf of his estimable mission,
of course.

175
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:44,214
What do you mean?

176
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:46,778
I mean that the remedy lies
in your own hands.

177
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:47,945
How?

178
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,281
You know how.

179
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:52,075
If you're really serious,
you'll know what to do! Damn it!

180
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,370
I'm sick of you coming to me
with these crackpot notions.

181
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:57,247
You know my responsibilities.

182
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,083
If you hadn't thrown
away all your chances,

183
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:00,834
you wouldn't be
in this position now.

184
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,169
Well, I've had enough.

185
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,632
You know what you have to do.
Grow up and do it!

186
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:09,009
My last resort.

187
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:12,053
My very last resort!
How can you suggest it?

188
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:13,847
Groom!

189
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:16,308
Groom!

190
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,769
Where the devil are you?

191
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:07,317
In which room is Mr. Shlessinger's
meeting taking place?

192
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:10,362
I am afraid the meeting finished
half an hour ago, Madam.

193
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,031
Mr. Shlessinger will have left for
Whitehaven by now.

194
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:17,661
Oh, yes. Yes, I've forgotten.
Thank you.

195
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,375
Lady Frances!

196
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:35,720
Leave me alone.

197
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:41,059
Excuse me.

198
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:43,270
You, sir!

199
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:49,025
<i>I've no doubt you will tell me
my fears are unfounded, Holmes,</i>

200
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,904
<i>but the repeated appearance of this
man has cast a shadow over her life</i>

201
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,866
<i>which, try as she might,
she cannot lift.</i>

202
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:11,089
Evening paper, Mr. Holmes.

203
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:22,976
Mrs. Hudson, fetch me a cab!

204
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:24,245
Mrs. Hudson. As soon as
the telegraph office is open,

205
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:31,544
to Dr. John Watson, Lake Hotel,
Fellmere, Cumberland.

206
00:17:31,987 --> 00:17:33,755
But Mr. Holmes?

207
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,076
I shall not be here, Mrs. Hudson.

208
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,218
<i>Dr. Watson!</i>

209
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:40,345
I shall be on the 8:17 out of Euston.

210
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,055
Dr. Watson!

211
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,016
My cab awaits you downstairs.

212
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,143
Read.

213
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:49,312
- Mr. Holmes...
- Read!

214
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:58,154
"Grave danger Lady Frances, stop.
Never let from sight, stop."

215
00:17:58,388 --> 00:18:01,074
"On my way, Holmes."

216
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,867
How long has this been here?

217
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:40,572
Holmes.

218
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:45,243
Disappeared, Watson.

219
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,081
Disappeared.

220
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:53,543
- Did Lady Frances pay her bill?
- No, sir.

221
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:56,546
Did she order any transport?

222
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,089
No, sir.

223
00:18:58,156 --> 00:18:59,841
And she took none of her luggage?

224
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:01,718
We think not, sir.

225
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:04,763
Where is Mr. Holmes?

226
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,477
Nothing yet, Holmes.

227
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:14,814
I'm beginning to fear the worst.

228
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:17,525
I blame myself. I knew I should
have pursued that fellow.

229
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,235
It is a possibility.

230
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:21,780
What is?

231
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:24,240
Do you not see it?
It is most conspicuous.

232
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:28,036
The skiff, Watson,
the sailing skiff.

233
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:30,121
- It's not here.
- Precisely.

234
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:34,459
It is possible there lies the Lady
Frances Carfax silent road to Arranside.

235
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:36,419
It is the nearest railhead
as you know.

236
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:39,506
You don't mean that this fellow
abducted her by boat?

237
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:44,594
Silk. It is one of the three
more likely possibilities.

238
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,766
Best French sewn, dove gray.

239
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:51,585
She had a gray silk shawl.

240
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:52,853
No, that will tell us
nothing more.

241
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:54,857
What other three possibilities,
Holmes?

242
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,232
In what did she usually
wear the shawl?

243
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:59,526
Oh, her outside clothes.
The three possibilities?

244
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,029
She may have run away with
her intended abductor.

245
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:05,323
He may have abducted her by boat
as you suggest or by some other means.

246
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,111
She may, considering
her emotional condition,

247
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:09,620
have been deceived
into going with him.

248
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:12,330
I can hardly believe that. She was
terrified of him, believe me.

249
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:13,581
I believe you.

250
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:16,668
Yes.

251
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:20,421
A stray chicken in
the world of foxes.

252
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:23,633
Once she's gobbled up,
she's hardly missed.

253
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:25,970
Come, Watson.

254
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,788
And our horses should
be saddled by now.

255
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:28,789
Horses?

256
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:31,349
I have been somewhat extravagant
in choice of mounts,

257
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,018
but delay must be dangerous
in this matter.

258
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:36,521
We should be
at Rufton Hall at dusk.

259
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:48,700
I don't see what possible interest
it could have for you, sir.

260
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,326
Considerable interest
I assure you.

261
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:52,370
One of the most dangerous classes
in the world

262
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,706
is the drifting and friendless woman

263
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,958
with no one to
protect and guide her.

264
00:20:56,983 --> 00:21:00,253
She is the inevitable inciter
of crime in others.

265
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:05,592
I treat the disappearance of
your sister with utmost seriousness.

266
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,719
Do you think I do not?

267
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,846
I'm merely suggesting that
it is frivolous

268
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:13,016
to keep from me
the substance of your quarrel.

269
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:17,520
It was after all this quarrel which
immediately preceded her disappearance.

270
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:23,276
Might it have something to do with
a drunken poet she once knew?

271
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:25,070
What?

272
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:28,823
I understand of my colleague that
she may have seen him recently.

273
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,491
Green?

274
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,245
I thought I'd seen the last of him.

275
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:39,918
I sent him packing 15 years ago.

276
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:42,003
What is his connection
with your sister?

277
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:45,673
He used to court her,
great brute of a fellow.

278
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:47,592
She wouldn't have anything
to do with him.

279
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:53,806
The Honorable Philip Green.
Never was a title so abused.

280
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:57,852
He went to the dogs completely,
drink, gambling.

281
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:02,357
Ended up destitute in Islington
pretending to write poetry.

282
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:07,070
Of course, Frances became interested
in him as soon as he lost everything.

283
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:09,489
How did you send him packing?

284
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,035
He was a violent fellow,
and he drank.

285
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,122
I'd heard talk of prosecution,
debt, assault.

286
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:22,335
I gave him 100 pounds and
bought him a ticket to Australia.

287
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:25,463
Show his face around here,
I'll set the dogs on him.

288
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,342
Now, your quarrel with your sister.

289
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:35,556
Money. She wanted money.

290
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:37,642
She has none of her own?

291
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:40,019
I make her an allowance
out of the estate.

292
00:22:40,253 --> 00:22:43,231
It's modest, but
you've seen the place.

293
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:44,941
She has no assets herself?

294
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:50,738
Yes, she has.

295
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:55,702
I told her if she wanted money,
she could sell this.

296
00:22:56,895 --> 00:22:58,955
It's a priceless collection.

297
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:07,755
That was designed for
the French royal family by Fragonard.

298
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:11,676
We acquired it all at the revolution,
and now, it's hers.

299
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:16,973
What I have is owls,
owls in the East Wing.

300
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:18,516
Want to see the owls?

301
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,980
Where does she keep them?
Does she travel with them?

302
00:23:24,846 --> 00:23:25,941
No.

303
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,692
Well, now, where are they kept?

304
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:33,573
My Lord, your sister
has vanished!

305
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,701
How and why we do not know,

306
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:40,830
but I have reason to believe
that she is in the gravest danger.

307
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,667
Were we to know the
whereabouts of the jewelry,

308
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:46,627
we might have some chance
of saving her.

309
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:52,008
The Oxford and Lombard Maritime
Bank in Pall Mall.

310
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:53,843
Thank you.

311
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:04,479
The Oxford and Lombard Bank
opens its doors in 12 hours.

312
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,798
She may already have
come and gone.

313
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,717
The bank's been open
for 20 minutes.

314
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:11,712
I've been quite blind, Holmes.

315
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,508
I had the evidence in the palm of
my hand. If anything's happened...

316
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,510
Calm yourself, my dear friend.

317
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,183
Holmes, look!

318
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,814
May I help you, sir?

319
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:34,610
Yes, please, I wish to see
the manager, Sir Paulo McNeil.

320
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:37,447
It's a private matter concerning
a family deposit with the bank.

321
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:38,614
My colleague...

322
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:46,455
Watson!

323
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:47,622
You, sir.

324
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:52,044
You, sir! What have you done with
the Lady Frances Carfax?

325
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,172
I insist upon an answer.

326
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:05,308
Mr. Green, sir,
please excuse my friend.

327
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:08,060
He spent the last night
on the Carlisle rail express.

328
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:11,355
No, Watson, please, please.

329
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:19,864
Frances!

330
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:28,331
Frances!

331
00:26:57,135 --> 00:26:58,361
I blame myself.

332
00:26:58,386 --> 00:27:01,030
No, you need not.

333
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:04,709
Nevertheless, I do.

334
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:09,255
We all bear equal blame.

335
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:12,049
She's disappeared again,
and that is that.

336
00:27:13,284 --> 00:27:15,636
It is pointless to dwell on it.

337
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:19,682
Our task now is to find her.

338
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,310
Mr. Green,

339
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:25,313
let us go back to that moment
by the lake yesterday morning.

340
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:28,983
I was out riding in the dawn

341
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:33,654
and I saw the skiff sailing across
the lake toward Arranside.

342
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:36,210
And you realized that it was
the Lady Frances?

343
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:37,408
Yes.

344
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:38,618
Was she alone?

345
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:39,993
Yes.

346
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,038
Please continue.

347
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,749
I managed to board the same train.

348
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,752
I begged her to speak to me.

349
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:53,257
I told her how I'd traveled the world
and had become a very rich man.

350
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:57,887
I told her that I'd
never stopped loving her,

351
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:01,682
and that she could have
whatever she wanted.

352
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:05,645
I can see her now.

353
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:10,941
She sat saying nothing,
smiling like a sphinx.

354
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:18,949
"No," she said...
She wanted to go her own way.

355
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:23,454
When we got to London,
I followed her as best I could,

356
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:27,875
but she seemed determined
to be rid of me.

357
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:31,587
I lost her somewhere
near Sellick Bridge.

358
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:35,216
Sellick?
Oh, that is most interesting.

359
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,300
Why?

360
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:41,597
I'm reliably informed that his usual
haunts are west of Westminster.

361
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:44,016
Who's haunts?

362
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:46,519
How did you come to
be at the bank?

363
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:49,647
I reasoned that she would be needing
money while she was in London,

364
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:52,858
and I know the address of
the family bank well enough.

365
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:56,612
I had the wild idea of
enlisting the manager's help.

366
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:02,785
Do you know where she is,
Mr. Holmes?

367
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:09,834
No, I do not.

368
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:12,420
Where do you think she is?

369
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:15,548
I believe that through
our efforts to save her,

370
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,343
we have driven her into
the hands of her worst enemy.

371
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,262
But we saw her free.

372
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,765
My dear Watson, a person may
walk over the edge of the cliff

373
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:26,350
because they've been
invited to gaze at the moon.

374
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:30,896
Her eyes may be open, but
she is, I believe, at this moment

375
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:34,275
walking into mortal danger.

376
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:42,950
Shlessinger?

377
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,786
Mr. Shlessinger.

378
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:49,457
This last week I sought
to acquaint myself

379
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:51,751
with the world of
apostolic missions.

380
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,630
I've also made a search of
the records of Scotland Yard.

381
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,677
Shlessinger

382
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,806
is also known as
the Reverend Joseph Cubbington,

383
00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:08,893
Amos Callow, the Dean of Masaro,

384
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:13,147
and Edmund, the Bishop of Lima.

385
00:30:14,298 --> 00:30:18,110
His real name, in fact, is Peters.
He's a confidence trickster,

386
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,613
known at Scotland Yard
by the uninspired logic

387
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:23,115
of that place as Holy Peters.

388
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:25,493
What is not yet suspected,

389
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:28,913
but incontrovertible, nonetheless, is
that he is a murderer.

390
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:37,004
Peter's specialty is the beguiling of
single women with private means

391
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,174
by playing on their religious and
charitable feelings.

392
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:46,430
Helena Rosenbloom had been engaged
in charitable work for ten years

393
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:48,182
when she met Shlessinger.

394
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:53,896
He inspired her to devote her energies
to a new mission in the Andes.

395
00:30:54,922 --> 00:31:00,361
Miss Rosenbloom changed her will,
said good-bye to her former life,

396
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:06,075
and boarded the SS Almeria at
Glasgow bound for South America.

397
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:11,038
She was lost overboard
the first night at sea.

398
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,837
The SS Almeria docked
at Liverpool

399
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:20,214
for the family to retrieve
her effects.

400
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,759
Shlessinger also disembarked.

401
00:31:23,784 --> 00:31:25,761
He went to ground at
the Lake District

402
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:28,764
where he met his next
intended victim,

403
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:33,727
the Lady Frances Carfax.

404
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:56,625
At last, gentlemen!

405
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,794
At last!

406
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:02,798
Where was it pawned?

407
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:04,008
Riley's of Stockwell.

408
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:07,344
It was by my calculation
the 27th shop I tried.

409
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:09,972
Riley has received two sentences
to my knowledge

410
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:12,808
for the receipt of stolen goods.
He will cooperate with us.

411
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:16,228
What does this mean?
What does it mean?

412
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:19,189
Please, Mr. Green, this is pointless.
Don't torture yourself.

413
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:21,775
Do you think the torture is
self-induced?

414
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:25,321
The thought of Frances
in the hands of criminals.

415
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:28,782
Such thoughts come unbidden,
Mr. Holmes.

416
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:30,576
They break through
the strongest defenses

417
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,536
the mind can raise against them.

418
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:36,874
Calm yourself, Mr. Green,
calm yourself.

419
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:38,834
If she's still innocent

420
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:42,087
of Shlessinger's true identify,
she may well be safe for a time.

421
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:44,506
And if not?

422
00:32:45,324 --> 00:32:49,428
Then it is clear that he cannot let
her loose without his own destruction.

423
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:57,353
Now, we must continue to hope that
she remains ignorant of who he is.

424
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:01,357
Fifteen years.

425
00:33:03,175 --> 00:33:06,320
I knew I could never come back
until I'd made something of myself.

426
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:09,950
Perhaps it was foolish
of me to think

427
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:13,160
that she would look kindly on me
after all these years, but...

428
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:17,915
I was ridiculously encouraged
by the fact that she was not married.

429
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:23,462
And now, my stupidity has driven her
into the arms of a murderer.

430
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:27,132
What can I do?

431
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:31,512
Is there nothing I can do?

432
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,391
Does Shlessinger know you
by sight?

433
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,016
No.

434
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:40,854
Ah, well, then there is something
that you can do.

435
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,815
But it'll demand great patience.

436
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,152
I have waited for 15 years,
Mr. Holmes.

437
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:50,447
Shlessinger's had a fair price for
the jewelry and no questions asked.

438
00:33:50,472 --> 00:33:53,075
He'll almost certainly return
to Riley's shop.

439
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,663
And Rosenblooms attorney for the will.
Now, give this note to Riley.

440
00:33:57,688 --> 00:33:58,832
He will let you wait at the shop.

441
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:02,918
It may be a long wait but
you must possess your soul in patience.

442
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:05,671
And above all, no violence.

443
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:19,828
It's late. Well, it should have
been here before now.

444
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:23,707
Daresay it took longer being
out of the ordinary.

445
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:26,293
The address, dear, remind me.

446
00:35:29,238 --> 00:35:30,798
Yes, sir, can I help?

447
00:35:30,948 --> 00:35:34,426
Argyll Street.
I'm looking for Argyll Street.

448
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:37,346
There's a post office
round the corner. Try there.

449
00:36:40,642 --> 00:36:43,120
Mr. Green, we can do nothing
without a warrant.

450
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:45,038
This is intolerable.

451
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:47,541
Until we have some wretched
signature on a piece of paper,

452
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:48,834
we can do nothing.

453
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:51,962
Meanwhile these fiends can do
with her what they will.

454
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:53,465
Are you certain that
you've told me every detail?

455
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:56,216
Every detail, I promise.

456
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:58,385
Then take this note to
Scotland Yard.

457
00:36:58,786 --> 00:37:01,013
They will understand
the urgency of it.

458
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,307
And I am to wait there
for the warrant.

459
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:04,975
You will not get it today.

460
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:11,565
Some delay is inevitable.
A magistrate must be found.

461
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:15,527
The process of the law can be
encouraged but not goaded.

462
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:19,031
Tomorrow may be too late
for God's sake.

463
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:22,701
Mr. Green, everything that can
be done will be done.

464
00:37:23,268 --> 00:37:24,368
Go.

465
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:29,249
Tomorrow may indeed be too late.

466
00:37:29,274 --> 00:37:30,542
I'm well aware of it.

467
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:35,380
Arm yourself, Watson.

468
00:37:36,573 --> 00:37:41,261
We are as usual the irregulars
who must take our luck together

469
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:43,931
as we have occasionally
done in the past.

470
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:52,272
8:00 tomorrow morning
Brixton Cemetery.

471
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:20,092
I fancy that you've been
misdirected, sir.

472
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,345
Possibly it you try further
down the street.

473
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,597
That will do.
We have no time to waste.

474
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:29,601
You are Henry Peters,
late Major Albert Shlessinger

475
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:30,936
veteran of the Boer War.

476
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:33,855
Your further aliases I will not bore
you by repeating.

477
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:36,900
And what is your name?

478
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:40,320
Sherlock Holmes. My friend and
companion I think you know.

479
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:43,949
The house will shortly be
under police observation

480
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:47,035
until a warrant is prepared
authorizing a search of the premises.

481
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,998
Your name does not frighten me,
Mr. Holmes. I have nothing to hide.

482
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:52,541
What is your business?

483
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:55,168
I'm looking for
the Lady Frances Carfax.

484
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:57,129
I'm delighted to hear it.

485
00:38:57,404 --> 00:39:00,215
If anyone can find her,
I imagine you can.

486
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,884
Perhaps you'd be so good
as to tell me when you do.

487
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:06,513
I've a note against her
for nearly 100 pounds,

488
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,224
and nothing to show for it
but a couple of trumpery pendants

489
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:11,184
that the dealer would
hardly look at.

490
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:12,728
The woman's a leech.

491
00:39:12,753 --> 00:39:14,771
How dare you, sir.

492
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:18,525
You imposed upon us as a man
crippled in a military action.

493
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,068
You are a fraud.

494
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:22,989
Oh, it may not have been
a military action

495
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:26,116
to satisfy your standards
of slaughter, Doctor,

496
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,036
but it was enough for me.

497
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:33,957
Hm-mm. I salute your powers
of improvisation, sir,

498
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:36,668
and your effrontery,
but it will not do.

499
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:40,964
Oh, I'm perfectly serious.
You find her, and I'm your debtor.

500
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:43,175
I mean to go through this house
until I do.

501
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:45,093
You have a warrant?

502
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:47,054
This will serve until
a better one comes.

503
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,722
Why, you're a common burglar.

504
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:50,640
And my friend is
a dangerous ruffian.

505
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,406
Together we mean to
go through your house.

506
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,561
I'm in no position to stop you.

507
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:58,231
Search where you will.
I have nothing to hide.

508
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:01,735
Where is the coffin that you had
brought in to this house?

509
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:03,820
That is none of your business.

510
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:05,572
I repeat. Where?

511
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:10,202
Is it not enough that you force
your way into my home,

512
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:12,454
that you threaten me at gunpoint

513
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:16,500
must you also now invade
the peace of the dead?

514
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:17,709
Where?

515
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:20,420
I shall not tell you.

516
00:40:20,946 --> 00:40:22,422
Hold him here, Watson.

517
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:31,932
I don't believe you'd use that
on an unarmed man, Doctor,

518
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:34,017
and in my condition.

519
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:38,438
I was a soldier in India, sir.
I've shot nobler creatures than you.

520
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:40,857
Lights, Watson! Lights!

521
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:48,323
I smelled formaldehyde
and astringent.

522
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:01,711
Thank God. It's not her.

523
00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:10,013
Get them out.

524
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:14,516
You have violated the peace of
the dead. You will now leave.

525
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,143
Who is she?

526
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:19,104
- Get them out.
- Her name is Rose Spender.

527
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:20,189
Get them out!

528
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:22,232
She is my wife's old nurse.

529
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:24,943
She's been with
the family for half a century.

530
00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:28,947
She died two days ago. We are to
bury her tomorrow morning.

531
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:32,951
Now, get out before
I ask the police,

532
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:36,329
you have summoned to my home
to come in and throw you out.

533
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:11,364
I've been considering
the problem, Holmes.

534
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:18,163
It does seem to me that they could
not have murdered Lady Frances

535
00:42:18,188 --> 00:42:21,124
and thought to have disposed of
her body in that coffin,

536
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:27,130
for they would then be faced
with burying the old lady.

537
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,221
It may be that this burial
has no connection

538
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:36,598
with Lady Frances' disappearance
after all.

539
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:38,850
I mean she was, as you know,
the most-

540
00:42:41,336 --> 00:42:43,063
unpredictable creature.

541
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:47,526
It may be that she had
second thoughts about Shlessinger.

542
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:50,904
She may even have had some inkling
of the kind of man we-

543
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:53,490
believe him to be and
removed herself from the house.

544
00:42:53,932 --> 00:42:56,368
He was, after all,
happy to let us search it.

545
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:01,998
What do you think?

546
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,421
What is your theory then?

547
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,839
I have none.

548
00:43:13,243 --> 00:43:16,263
There are insufficient facts to
construct a theory.

549
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:50,046
You think there's something
you've overlooked?

550
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,126
<i>It's late.</i>

551
00:44:29,277 --> 00:44:31,630
<i>And, it should have been
there before now.</i>

552
00:44:32,781 --> 00:44:35,842
<i>Daresay it took longer
being out of the ordinary.</i>

553
00:44:48,463 --> 00:44:51,274
What has happened to any brains
that God has given me?

554
00:44:54,636 --> 00:44:55,862
Watson!

555
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,407
Quick, man! It's life or death.

556
00:44:59,432 --> 00:45:02,035
A hundred chances on death
and one on life.

557
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:15,090
Oh, God most mighty, holy,
most merciful savior,

558
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:17,342
and our most worthy
judge eternal,

559
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:21,763
suffer us not at our last hour
for any plains of death...

560
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:35,443
And never continuous in one stage.
In the midst of life, we are in death.

561
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:39,197
Of whom may we seek for succour
but of thee, oh, Lord,

562
00:45:39,222 --> 00:45:42,367
who for our sins art
justly displeased.

563
00:45:42,392 --> 00:45:45,120
Yet, oh, Lord, God, most holy...

564
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,002
For as much as it hath pleased
almighty God of his great mercy

565
00:45:53,028 --> 00:45:57,757
to take unto himself the soul of
our dear sister here departed,

566
00:45:57,782 --> 00:46:00,760
we therefore commit
her body to the ground.

567
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:07,267
Earth to earth

568
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:09,978
ashes to ashes

569
00:46:10,837 --> 00:46:13,940
dust to dust
in sure and certain...

570
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:15,191
Stop!

571
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:18,820
Raise that coffin.

572
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,199
What the devil do you mean
by this sacrilege?

573
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,868
Murder, sir,

574
00:46:26,436 --> 00:46:28,288
Murder is what I mean.

575
00:46:28,855 --> 00:46:32,792
Why such a deep coffin
for such a small old lady?

576
00:46:32,817 --> 00:46:34,043
A sovereign to each of you

577
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:36,463
if you can lift the lid off
that coffin in one minute.

578
00:46:50,126 --> 00:46:51,311
Watson.

579
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:02,781
Stop or I'll shoot!

580
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,571
It's chloroform.

581
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:47,325
She's known literally
the terrors of the grave.

582
00:47:47,642 --> 00:47:49,702
God knows what this will
have done to her.

583
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,921
I've failed.

584
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:16,020
<i>I have brought her back here
to the country of her childhood</i>

585
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:19,274
<i>which is one of the most beautiful
on this planet.</i>

586
00:48:20,759 --> 00:48:23,862
<i>There has been
a great improvement as a result.</i>

587
00:48:24,596 --> 00:48:28,366
<i>A landscape so familiar and
so intimate to her</i>

588
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:31,703
<i>will prompt in time
a full response I feel sure,</i>

589
00:48:32,353 --> 00:48:34,581
<i>as will the company of
friends and family</i>

590
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:37,333
<i>who've all been most
kind and dutiful.</i>

591
00:48:39,444 --> 00:48:42,213
<i>Her poor brother, the Earl,
is beside himself</i>

592
00:48:42,238 --> 00:48:44,132
<i>with anger at the criminals</i>

593
00:48:44,157 --> 00:48:46,926
<i>and with mortification at
his having quarreled</i>

594
00:48:46,993 --> 00:48:50,096
<i>with Frances before
all this happened.</i>

595
00:48:52,248 --> 00:48:57,520
<i>Finally, please accept the enclosed
as a token of my gratitude</i>

596
00:48:57,545 --> 00:49:01,566
<i>for your saving of
my dear Frances, Mr. Holmes,</i>

597
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:06,487
<i>and I look forward to our
entertainment of you and Dr. Watson</i>

598
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:08,656
<i>in a happier future.</i>

599
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:11,200
I cannot accept it.

600
00:49:13,144 --> 00:49:16,789
I refuse to be rewarded
for fostering a tragedy.

601
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,003
I've never suffered such a
complete eclipse of my faculties.

602
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:25,924
Well, like any eclipse, Holmes,
it's only temporary.

603
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:29,010
There's every hope of
a full recovery.

604
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,305
I wonder...

605
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:41,814
I wonder.

606
00:49:48,346 --> 00:49:49,614
Frances?
