1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,800
Was it all just a dream?

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,160
God bless you, Florida! Thank you!

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,040
Did the last four years
not really happen?

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Look, there's Ben Affleck.
He's often in my dreams.

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,280
And the Taxi Driver guy.
He was there too.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,040
And little Stevie Wonder,
he seemed so happy...

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,560
...like a miracle had taken place.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,600
Was it a dream?

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,120
We want Gore!

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,120
Or was it real?

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,680
It was election night 2000, and things
seemed to be going as planned.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,440
In New York, Al Gore is
our projected winner.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,240
The Garden State is green for Gore.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,280
We project Mr. Gore the winner in
Delaware. This state has voted with...

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,680
Excuse me, one second.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,040
Mike, I wouldn't do this
if it weren't big.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,360
Florida goes for Al Gore.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,800
CNN announces that we call Florida
in the Al Gore column.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,960
Then something called the Fox News
Channel called the election...

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,480
...in favor of the other guy.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,480
Fox News now projects George
W. Bush the winner in Florida...

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,040
...and thus it appears the winner of the
presidency of the United States.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
All of a sudden, the other
networks said:

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,200
"Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true. "

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,160
All of us at the networks made
a mistake...

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,560
...and projected Florida
in the Al Gore column.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,120
It was our mistake.

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,120
What most people don't know is
that the man in charge...

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,560
...of the decision desk at Fox
that night...

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,480
...the man who called it for Bush...

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,080
...was none other than Bush's
first cousin John Ellis.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,320
How does someone like Bush get
away with something like this?

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,400
Well, first, it helps if your brother is
the governor of the state in question.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,360
You know something? We are gonna
win Florida. Mark my words.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,040
You can write it down.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,320
Second, make sure
your campaign chairman...

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,320
...is also the vote-count woman
and that her state hires a company...

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,680
...to knock voters off the rolls
who aren't likely to vote for you.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,040
You can usually tell them
by the color of their skin.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,320
Then make sure your side fights
like it's life or death.

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,880
This talk about legitimacy
is overblown.

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,640
President Bush! President Bush!

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
And hope the other side
sits by.

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,600
And even if numerous independent
investigations...

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,920
...prove that Gore got the
most votes...

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,560
If there was a statewide recount,
Gore won the election.

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,120
...it won't matter, as long as all
your daddy's friends...

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,640
...on the Supreme Court vote
the right way.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,800
While I strongly disagree with
the court's decision, I accept it.

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,360
What we need now is acceptance.

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,440
We have a new president-elect.

52
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,600
It turns out none of this was a dream.
It's what really happened.

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,280
On the day the joint session of both
the House of Representatives...

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,040
...and the Senate was to certify
the election results...

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,920
...Al Gore, in his dual role
as outgoing vice president...

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,680
...and president of the Senate...

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,360
...presided over the event
that would officially anoint...

58
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,160
...George W. Bush
as the new president.

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,000
If any congressman wanted to raise
an objection, the rules insisted...

60
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,000
...that he or she had to have the
signed support of just one senator.

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,480
Mr. President, and I take great pride
in calling you that...

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,440
...I must object because
of the overwhelming evidence...

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,400
...of misconduct, deliberate fraud
and an attempt to suppress voter...

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,080
The chair must remind members
that under Section 18 of Title 3...

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,240
...United States Code, no debate
is allowed in the joint session.

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Thank you, Mr. President.
To answer your question...

67
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,720
...the objection is in writing, signed
by a number of members...

68
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,080
...of the House of Representatives,
but not by a member of the Senate.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,720
Mr. President, it is in writing and
signed by several House colleagues...

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,720
...on behalf, and myself, of the 27,000
voters of Duval County...

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,400
...in which 16,000 of them are
African-Americans...

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,360
...that was disenfranchised
in this last election.

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,800
Is the objection signed by a member
of the Senate?

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,520
Not signed by a member
of the Senate.

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
The Senate is missing.

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,760
It is in writing and signed
by myself...

77
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
...on behalf of many
of the diverse constituents...

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
...especially those
in the 9th Congressional District...

79
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,520
...and all American voters who
recognize that the Supreme Court...

80
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,600
...not the people of the United States,
decided this election.

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,200
Is the objection signed
by a senator?

82
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,560
Unfortunately, Mr. President, it is
not signed by one single senator.

83
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,440
I have no authority
over the United States Senate...

84
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
...and no senator has signed.

85
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,920
Mr. President, it is in writing and
signed by myself and several...

86
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,960
...of my constituents from Florida.
A senator is needed, but missing.

87
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Is the objection in writing...

88
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,680
...and signed by a member
of the House and a senator?

89
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,080
The objection is in writing,
and I don't care...

90
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,760
...that it is not signed by a member
of the Senate.

91
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,840
The chair will advise that the rules
do care...

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,320
...and the signature of a senator...

93
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,280
Not a single senator came to the aid
of the African-Americans in Congress.

94
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,240
One after another, they were told
to sit down and shut up.

95
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,400
It's a sad day in America,
Mr. President, when we can't find...

96
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,480
...a senator to sign the objections...

97
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,640
- The gentleman will suspend...
- New Democratic senators won't sign.

98
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,640
- I object.
- The gentleman will suspend.

99
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
Inauguration coverage, 2001...

100
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,760
...on a nasty, but it could be worse,
kind of day in Washington.

101
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,640
- What do we want?
- Justice!

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
- When do we want it?
- Now!

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,920
On the day George W. Bush was
inaugurated...

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,080
...tens of thousands of Americans
poured into the streets of D. C...

105
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,440
...in one last attempt to reclaim
what had been taken from them.

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,320
They pelted Bush's limo with eggs...

107
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,200
Stay back! Get back!

108
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,880
...and brought the inauguration
parade to a halt.

109
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,480
The plan to have Bush get out
of the limo for the traditional walk...

110
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
...to the White House
was scrapped.

111
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Bush's limo hit the gas to prevent
an even larger riot.

112
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,600
No president had ever witnessed
such a thing on his inauguration day.

113
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,320
And for the next eight months, it didn't
get any better for George W. Bush.

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,760
He couldn't get his judges appointed,
he struggled to pass his legislation...

115
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,720
...and he lost Republican control
of the Senate.

116
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,280
His approval ratings in the polls
began to sink.

117
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,840
He was already beginning to look
like a lame-duck president.

118
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,440
With everything going wrong,
he did what any of us would do.

119
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,120
He went on vacation.

120
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,080
Oh, no!

121
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,680
In his first eight months in office
before September 11 th...

122
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,760
...George W. Bush was on vacation,
according to The Washington Post...

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,760
...42 percent of the time.

124
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,920
If I hit every shot good, people would
say I wasn't working.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It was not surprising that Mr. Bush
needed some time off.

126
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,680
Being president is a lot of work.

127
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,280
What about these folks that say that
you're taking too long of a vacation?

128
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,040
They don't understand the definition
of work, then.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm getting a lot done. You don't
have to be in Washington to work.

130
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,760
It's amazing what can happen
with telephones and faxes.

131
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Thank you so much.

132
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,920
- Is this to Destiny and Bubba?
- Yeah.

133
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
What are you doing the rest
of the day?

134
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,680
Karen Hughes is coming over.
We're working on some things.

135
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,120
And she'll be over here. We're working
on a few things, a few matters.

136
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,320
I'm working on some initiatives.
We're... You'll see.

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,280
There'll be some decisions
I will have made while I'm here.

138
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,560
We'll be announcing them
as time goes on.

139
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,760
The first time I met him, he had
some good advice for me.

140
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,800
Governor Bush, it's Michael Moore.

141
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
Behave yourself, will you?
Go find real work.

142
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,680
And work was something he knew
a lot about.

143
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
- Anybody want some grits?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Relaxing at Camp David.
Yachting off Kennebunkport.

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,480
How you doing?

146
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Or being a cowboy on the ranch
in Texas.

147
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,240
I love nature, getting
in the truck with my dogs.

148
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,120
Oh, hi.

149
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,120
George Bush spent the rest
of August at the ranch...

150
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,400
...where life was less complicated.

151
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,080
Armadillos love to dig the soil
looking for bugs.

152
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
And...

153
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,040
So I went out there the other day,
and there was Barney...

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,600
...buried in this hole,
chasing an armadillo.

155
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
It was a summer to remember.

156
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,040
Afterward, he left Texas for
his second-favorite place.

157
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,600
On September 10th, he joined
his brother in Florida...

158
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,920
...where they looked at files
and met important Floridians.

159
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,760
He went to sleep that night in a bed
made with fine French linens.

160
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Do you suppose he's pretty
confident...

161
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
...on those numbers on Iraqi
security forces?

162
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,360
Make me look young.

163
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,960
Yeah, I've got a little,
sort of air noise.

164
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,560
Yeah, just don't turn it up too much.
I don't want to blow my head off.

165
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,960
I got a mike here
if they want to use it.

166
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,160
Testing, one, two. This is
the Oval Office. Testing, one, two.

167
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,720
Testing, one, two.
This is the Oval Office.

168
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Testing, one, two, three, four, five.

169
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,480
We have something that has
happened here...

170
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,560
...at the World Trade Center.
We noticed a flame...

171
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,360
...and an awful lot of smoke...

172
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,160
This is horrible.

173
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,280
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

174
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,640
Oh, my, dear.

175
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,800
Let's go! Let's go, back!
Come on, let's go!

176
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,520
Oh, my God!

177
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,760
Save their souls, Lord.
Save their souls, Lord.

178
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,880
Oh, they're jumping.

179
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,560
On September 11 th, 2001,
nearly 3000 people...

180
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,760
...including a colleague of mine,
Bill Weems...

181
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,320
...were killed in the largest foreign
attack ever on American soil.

182
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,880
The targets were the financial
and military headquarters...

183
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,840
...of the United States.

184
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,240
If anyone has any idea or they've seen
him or knows where he is, to call us.

185
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,600
He's got two little babies.
Two little babies.

186
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,080
As the attack took place,
Mr. Bush was on his way...

187
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,080
...to an elementary school
in Florida.

188
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,920
When informed of the first plane
hitting the World Trade Center...

189
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,480
...where terrorists had struck
just eight years prior...

190
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,480
...Mr. Bush decided to go ahead
with his photo opportunity.

191
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,760
- Good morning, boys and girls.
- Good morning.

192
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,760
Good morning.

193
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,520
Read this word the fast way.
Get ready.

194
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,320
- "Mad"!
- Yes. Get ready.

195
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,920
- "Calf"!
- Yeah.

196
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,280
Get ready to read the words on this
page without making a mistake.

197
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,720
When the second plane hit
the tower...

198
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,240
...his chief of staff entered
the classroom...

199
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,520
...and told Mr. Bush,
"The nation is under attack. "

200
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Not knowing what to do, with no one
telling him what to do...

201
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,600
...and no Secret Service rushing
in to take him to safety...

202
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,000
...Mr. Bush just sat there...

203
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,480
...and continued to read
My Pet Goat with the children.

204
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,240
Nearly seven minutes passed
with nobody doing anything.

205
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,480
As Bush sat in that Florida
classroom...

206
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,160
...was he wondering if maybe
he should have shown up...

207
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,120
...to work more often?

208
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,640
Should he have held at least one
meeting since taking office...

209
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,680
...to discuss the threat of terrorism
with his head of counterterrorism?

210
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,360
Maybe Bush wondered why he had
cut terrorism funding from the FBI.

211
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,720
Or perhaps he just should have read
the security briefing...

212
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,120
...that was given to him on
August 6th, 2001...

213
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
...which said Osama bin Laden
was planning...

214
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,840
...to attack America by hijacking
airplanes.

215
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,520
Maybe he wasn't worried, because
the title of the report was too vague.

216
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,200
I believe the title was
"Bin Laden Determined...

217
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,240
...to Attack Inside the United States. "

218
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,560
A report like that might make
some men jump...

219
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,200
...but, as in days past,
George W. Just went fishing.

220
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,480
As the minutes went by, George Bush
continued to sit in the classroom.

221
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,120
Was he thinking, "I've been hanging
out with the wrong crowd.

222
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,800
Which one of them screwed me?

223
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Was it the guy my daddy's friends
delivered a lot of weapons to?

224
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,040
Was it that group of religious
fundamentalists...

225
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,120
...who visited my state when
I was governor?

226
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,680
Or was it the Saudis?

227
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,160
Damn. It was them. I think
I better blame it on this guy. "

228
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,240
In the days following
September 11 th...

229
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,640
...all commercial and private airline
traffic was grounded.

230
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,000
The FAA has taken the action to close
all of the airports in the United States.

231
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,280
Even grounding the president's
father, former President Bush...

232
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,480
...on a flight forced to land
in Milwaukee.

233
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,080
Thousands of travelers were stranded,
among them Ricky Martin...

234
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,720
...due to appear at tonight's
Latin Grammy Awards.

235
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,400
Not even Ricky Martin could fly.
But really, who wanted to fly?

236
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,360
No one, except the bin Ladens.

237
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,600
We had airplanes pick up...

238
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,080
...Osama bin Laden's family
and other Saudis...

239
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,920
...and transport them out
of the U.S.

240
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,520
The White House approved planes...

241
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,440
...to pick up the bin Ladens
and numerous other Saudis.

242
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,200
At least six private jets and nearly
two dozen commercial planes...

243
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,160
...carried the Saudis
and bin Ladens...

244
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,760
...out of the U.S. After
September 13th.

245
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,600
In all, 142 Saudis, including 24
members of the bin Laden family...

246
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,560
...were allowed to leave
the country.

247
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,240
Osama's always been portrayed
as the black sheep in the family...

248
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,920
...that they cut off all relationship
with him in 1994.

249
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,280
It's more complicated than that.

250
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
Osama has had contact with
other family members?

251
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,240
Right. In the summer of 2001, just
before 9l11, one of Osama's sons...

252
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,200
...got married in Afghanistan,
and several family members...

253
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
...showed up at the wedding.
- Bin Ladens?

254
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,920
That's right. So they're not cut off
completely. That's an exaggeration.

255
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,280
We now welcome to
Larry King Live...

256
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,320
...Prince Bandar, ambassador of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the U.S.

257
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,440
You had about 24 members
of bin Laden's family, and...

258
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
- Here?
- In America. Students and...

259
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,960
His Majesty felt it's not fair for those
innocent people to be subjected...

260
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,040
...to any harm. On the other hand,
we understood the high emotions...

261
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,800
...so, with coordination with the FBI,
we got them out.

262
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,960
This is retired FBI agent
Jack Cloonan.

263
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,680
Before 9/11, he was a senior agent
on the joint FBl-CIA...

264
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,120
...al Qaeda task force.

265
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,320
I, as an investigator, would not
want these people to have left.

266
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,600
I think, in the case of the bin Laden
family, it would have been prudent...

267
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,160
...to hand the subpoenas out, have
them come in, get on-the-record.

268
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,600
You know, get on-the-record.

269
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,520
- That's the proper procedure?
- Yeah.

270
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,320
How many people were pulled off
airlines after that...

271
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,080
...coming into the country
who were Middle Eastern...

272
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,280
...or they fit a very general picture.

273
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,440
We held hundreds of people
for weeks and months at a time.

274
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,720
Did the authorities do anything when
the bin Ladens tried to leave?

275
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,480
No. They were identified
at the airport.

276
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,400
They looked at their passports,
and they were identified.

277
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,760
That would happen to us
if we left the country.

278
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
- Exactly.
- Interview, check the passport.

279
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,600
- What else?
- Nothing.

280
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,800
I don't know about you,
but usually...

281
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,760
...when the police can't find
a murderer...

282
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,880
...don't they usually wanna talk
to the family members...

283
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,120
...to find out where they think
he might be?

284
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,000
You don't know
where your husband is?

285
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,800
If you hear anything,
let us know.

286
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Can you come downtown,
give a statement?

287
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,560
- How long?
- You've got time.

288
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
Mine's worth money. Yours isn't.

289
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,240
- Send a bill.
- I asked you a question.

290
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,840
- Answer them. Don't ask them.
- I pay your salary, cop.

291
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,320
Sit down. I'm gonna earn it.

292
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah. That's how cops do it.
What was going on here?

293
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,680
We need to know more about that.

294
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,360
It needs to be the subject
of an investigation.

295
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,920
What happened? How did it happen?
Why? Who authorized it?

296
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,520
Lmagine what those poor bastards
were feeling...

297
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,880
...when jumping off that
building to their death.

298
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,640
Those young guys and cops
and firemen...

299
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,560
...that ran into that building,
never asked a question.

300
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,200
And they're dead.
And families' lives are ruined.

301
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,480
- And they'll never have peace.
- That's right.

302
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,280
And if I had to inconvenience...

303
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,840
...a member of the bin Laden family
with a subpoena or a grand jury...

304
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
...do you think I'd lose sleep over it?
Not a minute.

305
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,280
No one would question it.
Not even the biggest civil libertarian.

306
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,560
- No, no. It's just...
- No one would question it.

307
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,560
You know, you got a lawyer? Fine.
Counsel? Fine.

308
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,400
Mr. Bin Laden, this is why I'm asking.
It isn't because I think you're anything.

309
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,520
I just want to ask you the questions
that I would anybody.

310
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,280
- Right.
- And that's all.

311
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,760
None of this made any sense.

312
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,840
Can you imagine in the days after
the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing...

313
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,200
...President Clinton helping to arrange
a trip...

314
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,200
...out of the country
for the Mc Veigh family?

315
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,160
What would have happened
to Clinton...

316
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,840
- ... if that had been revealed?
- Burn him! Burn him!

317
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
Prince Bandar, do you know
the bin Laden family?

318
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
- I do, very well.
- What are they like?

319
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,400
They're really lovely human beings.
He is the only one I never...

320
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,880
I don't know him well,
but I met him only once.

321
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,240
What was the circumstance
under which you met?

322
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,120
This is ironic. In the mid-'80s...

323
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,440
...if you remember,
we and the United States...

324
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
...were supporting the mujahideen...

325
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,480
...to liberate Afghanistan
from the Soviets.

326
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,640
He came to thank me for my efforts
to bring the Americans, our friends...

327
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,320
...to help us against the atheists,
the Communists. Isn't it ironic?

328
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,720
He came to thank you for helping
bring America to help him.

329
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,880
And now he may be responsible
for bombing America.

330
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,920
- Absolutely.
- What did you make of him?

331
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,040
- I was not impressed.
- Not impressed?

332
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,880
No. I thought he was a simple
and very quiet guy.

333
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,040
A simple and quiet guy, whose
family just happened to have...

334
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,920
...a business relationship with
the family of George W. Bush.

335
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Is that what he was thinking about?

336
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,360
Because if the public knew this,
it wouldn't look very good.

337
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,320
Was he thinking, "You know...

338
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,800
...I need a big, black marker"?

339
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,640
In early 2004, in a speech during
the New Hampshire primary...

340
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,320
...I called George W. Bush
a deserter...

341
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,600
...from his time
in the Texas Air National Guard.

342
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,880
In response, the White House
released his military records...

343
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,720
...in the hopes of disproving
the charge.

344
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,840
What Bush didn't know is
that I already had a copy...

345
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,680
...of his military records, uncensored,
obtained in the year 2000.

346
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,960
And there is one glaring difference
between the records released...

347
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,360
...in 2000 and those he released
in 2004.

348
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,920
A name had been blacked out.

349
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,760
In 1972, two airmen were suspended
for failing to take...

350
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:47,320
...their medical examination.
One was George W. Bush.

351
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,800
And the other was James R. Bath.

352
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,840
In 2000, the documents show
both names.

353
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,720
But in 2004, Bush and the White
House had Bath's name blacked out.

354
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,080
Why didn't Bush want the press
and the public...

355
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,320
...to see Bath's name
on his military records?

356
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,920
Perhaps he was worried that the
American people would find out...

357
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,600
...that at one time, James R. Bath...

358
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,880
...was the Texas money manager
for the bin Ladens.

359
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,760
Bush and Bath had become
good friends...

360
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,200
...when they both served in the
Texas Air National Guard.

361
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,800
After they were discharged...

362
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,520
...when Bush's dad was head
of the CIA...

363
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,680
...Bath opened up his own aviation
business after selling a plane...

364
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,120
...to a man by the name
of Salem bin Laden...

365
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,640
...heir to the second-largest fortune
in Saudi Arabia...

366
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
...the Saudi Binladin Group.

367
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
W. At that time was just starting off
in the world as a businessman.

368
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,960
Because he's a guy who's always
tried to emulate his father...

369
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,120
...he went into the oil business.
He founded an oil company, Arbusto...

370
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,080
...which was very good at drilling dry
holes that nothing came out of.

371
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,760
But the question has always been,
"Where did this money come from?"

372
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,040
Now, his dad was rich. His dad
could have done this for him...

373
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,200
...but his dad didn't do this for him.

374
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,480
There's no indication Daddy wrote a
check to start him off in his company.

375
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,840
So where did George W. Bush
get his money?

376
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,760
I'm George Bush.

377
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,200
One person who did invest in him
was James R. Bath.

378
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,680
Bush's good friend, James Bath,
was hired by the bin Laden family...

379
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,880
...to manage their money in Texas
and invest in businesses.

380
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,680
And James Bath himself, in turn,
invested in George W. Bush.

381
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,240
Bush ran Arbusto into the ground...

382
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,200
...as he did every other company
he was involved in...

383
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,920
...until finally one of his companies
was bought by Harken Energy...

384
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,160
...and they gave him a seat
on their board.

385
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,720
A lot of us suspected through
the years that there has been...

386
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,120
...Saudi oil money involved
in these companies:

387
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,600
Harken, Spectrum 7, Arbusto
Drilling, all the Bush companies.

388
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Whenever they got in trouble,
there were these angel investors...

389
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,760
...who flowed money into
the companies.

390
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,320
The question is, why would Saudis,
who had all the oil in the world...

391
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,200
...go around the globe to invest
in this lousy oil company?

392
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,360
And the thing is, Harken had one
big thing going for it...

393
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,040
...which is that George W. Bush
was on its board of directors...

394
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,280
...at a time when his father was
president of the United States.

395
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,480
When you're the president's son
and you've got unlimited access...

396
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,760
...combined with some credentials
from a prior campaign...

397
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,920
...in Washington, D.C., people tend
to respect that. Access is power.

398
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,720
And I can find my dad and talk
to him any time of the day.

399
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,160
Yes, it helps
to be the president's son...

400
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,440
...especially when you're being
investigated...

401
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,840
...by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

402
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,800
In 1990, when Mr. Bush was
a director of Harken Energy...

403
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,080
...he received this memo
from company lawyers...

404
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,800
...warning directors not to sell stock
if they had...

405
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,160
...unfavorable information about
the company.

406
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,560
One week later, he sold $848,000
worth of Harken stock.

407
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,520
Two months later, Harken announced
losses of more than $23 million.

408
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,080
The James Baker law partner
who helped Bush...

409
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
...beat the rap from the SEC...

410
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,120
...was a man by the name
of Robert Jordan...

411
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,920
...who, when George W. Became
president...

412
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,400
...was appointed ambassador
to Saudi Arabia.

413
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,840
After the Harken debacle, the friends
of Bush's dad got him a seat...

414
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,320
...on another board, of a company
owned by the Carlyle Group.

415
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,000
We looked at which companies gained
from September 11 th.

416
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,360
We turned up this company, Carlyle
Group, a multinational conglomerate...

417
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,240
...that invests in heavily
government-regulated industries...

418
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,480
...like telecommunications, health care
and particularly, defense.

419
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,560
Both George W. Bush
and George H.W. Bush...

420
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,960
...worked for the Carlyle Group,
the same company that counted...

421
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,920
...the bin Laden family among
its investors.

422
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,000
The Carlyle Group was holding
its annual investor conference...

423
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,960
...on the morning
of September 11 th...

424
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,480
...in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel
in Washington D.C.

425
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,320
At that meeting were
all of the Carlyle regulars...

426
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,920
...James Baker, likely John Major,
definitely George H.W. Bush...

427
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,600
...though he left the morning
of September 11 th.

428
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Shafiq bin Laden, who is
Osama bin Laden's half brother...

429
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,360
...was in town to look after his family's
investments in the Carlyle Group.

430
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
All of them together in one room,
watching...

431
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,960
...as the planes hit the towers.

432
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
In fact, the bin Laden family
was invested...

433
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,040
...in one of their defense funds,
which ironically meant...

434
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,120
...that as the U.S. Increased defense
spending, the bin Laden family...

435
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,480
...stood to gain from those investments
through the Carlyle Group.

436
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,760
Our commander in chief,
President George W. Bush.

437
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,000
With all the weapons companies
it owned...

438
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,920
...the Carlyle Group was, in essence,
the 11 th largest...

439
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,960
...defense contractor
in the United States.

440
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,680
- Thanks a lot.
- It owned United Defense...

441
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,240
...makers of the Bradley armored
fighting vehicle.

442
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,880
September 11 th guaranteed that
United Defense...

443
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,200
...was going to have
a very good year.

444
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,760
Just six weeks after 9/11...

445
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,800
...Carlyle filed to take
United Defense public...

446
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
...and made a one-day profit
of $237 million.

447
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
But sadly, with so much attention
focused...

448
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,440
...on the bin Laden family being
important Carlyle investors...

449
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,240
...the bin Ladens eventually
had to withdraw.

450
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,280
Bush's dad, though, stayed on
as senior adviser...

451
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,200
...to Carlyle's Asia board
for another two years.

452
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,240
As unseemly as it seems
to know that George H.W. Bush...

453
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,720
...was meeting
with the bin Laden family...

454
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,280
...while Osama was a wanted terrorist,
well before September 11 th...

455
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,920
...it's very discomforting
for Americans to know that.

456
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,680
George H.W. Bush is a man who
has, obviously, incredible reach...

457
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,400
...into the White House.

458
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,840
He receives daily CIA briefings,
which is the right of any ex-president...

459
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,320
...but very few ex-presidents
actually exercise that right. He does.

460
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,000
And, I think, in a very real way they
are benefiting from the confusion...

461
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,360
...that arises when George H.W. Bush
visits Saudi Arabia...

462
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,240
...on behalf of Carlyle
and meets with the royal family...

463
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,720
...and meets
with the bin Laden family.

464
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,600
Is he representing the United States
of America?

465
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,400
Or is he representing an investment
firm in the United States?

466
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,440
Or is he representing both?

467
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,960
This company is about money,
not conspiracies to run the world...

468
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,520
...or engineer political maneuvering
and things like that.

469
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,880
It's about making money,
and it's about making a lot of money.

470
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,360
And they've done very well.

471
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,640
I could get you on-the-record
on this question.

472
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,080
In the White House view,
there is no ethical conflict...

473
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,200
...in former President Bush and
former Secretary of State Jim Baker...

474
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,360
...using their contacts
with world leaders to represent...

475
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,520
...one of the most well-known military
arms dealers, the Carlyle Group?

476
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,280
The president has full faith
that his family will conform...

477
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,320
...with all proper ethics laws
and will act properly in their conduct.

478
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Okay, let's say one group of people,
like the American people...

479
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,800
...pay you $400,000 a year
to be president of the United States.

480
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,960
But then another group of people
invest in you, your friends...

481
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,960
...and their related businesses,
$ 1.4 billion over a number of years.

482
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,800
Who are you gonna like?
Who's your daddy?

483
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,280
That's how much the Saudi royals
and their associates...

484
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,280
...have given the Bush family, their
friends and their related businesses...

485
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,040
...in the past three decades.

486
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,600
Seems like a very nice reunion
with friends.

487
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,400
Is it rude to suggest
that when the Bush family...

488
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,240
...wakes up in the morning,
they might be thinking...

489
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,440
...about what's best for the Saudis
instead of what's best for you or me?

490
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,920
Because 1.4 billion just doesn't buy
a lot of flights out of the country.

491
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,160
It buys a lot of love.

492
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,120
Sooner or later,
this special relationship...

493
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,080
...with a regime that Amnesty
International condemns...

494
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,760
...as a widespread human-rights
violator...

495
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,640
...would come back to haunt
the Bushes.

496
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Now, after 9/11, it was
an embarrassment.

497
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,280
And they preferred that no one
ask any questions.

498
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,800
Investigation should have begun
on September 12th.

499
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,440
There's no reason it shouldn't have.
Three thousand were dead.

500
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,120
It should've gotten started
immediately.

501
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,720
First, Bush tried to stop Congress
from setting up...

502
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,760
- ... its own 9/11 investigation.
- It's important for us...

503
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,840
...to not reveal how
we collect information.

504
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,120
That's what the enemy wants.
And we're fighting an enemy.

505
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,280
When he couldn't stop Congress,
he then tried to stop...

506
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,480
...an independent 9/11 commission
from being formed.

507
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,840
The president's position was a break
from history.

508
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,960
Independent investigations were
launched after Pearl Harbor...

509
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,000
...and President Kennedy's
assassination.

510
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,000
But when Congress did complete
its own investigation...

511
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,320
...the Bush White House
censored 28 pages of the report.

512
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,360
The president is being pressed
by all sides to declassify the report.

513
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,440
U.S. Officials tell NBC News
most of the secret sources...

514
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,240
...involve Saudi Arabia.

515
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,080
We've given extraordinary cooperation
with Chairmen Kean and Hamilton.

516
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
We haven't gotten the materials
we needed...

517
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,040
...and haven't gotten them
in a timely fashion.

518
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,120
Will you testify
before the commission?

519
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,720
This commission? You know, I don't...
Testify? I'd be glad to visit with them.

520
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,360
What it will do is, the hole
that's in my heart...

521
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,880
...and has been in my heart
since September 11 th...

522
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,520
I lost my husband of 15 years.
I am now by myself.

523
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I need to know what happened
to him.

524
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,160
I know what I got back
from the autopsy.

525
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,920
That man was my life,
and I have no plan.

526
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,880
I was taking a class,
and they asked me...

527
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,480
...what was I gonna do in the next
five years.

528
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,240
And if I'm not doing something
with this, I don't know what reason...

529
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,000
...I have to live.
So it's very important.

530
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,280
Very important. Okay.

531
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,440
Okay.

532
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,920
Ignored by the Bush administration...

533
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,120
...more than 500 relatives
of 9/11 victims...

534
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,480
...filed suit against Saudi royals
and others.

535
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,080
The lawyers the Saudi
defense minister hired...

536
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
...to fight the 9/11 families?

537
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,840
The law firm of Bush family confidant,
James A. Baker.

538
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,480
So right here in the center of three
important American landmarks...

539
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,160
...the Watergate Hotel
and office building...

540
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,640
...the Kennedy Center over there...

541
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,320
...and the embassy of Saudi Arabia.

542
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,920
Yeah.

543
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,680
How much money do the Saudis
have invested in America, roughly?

544
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,760
I've heard figures as high
as $860 billion.

545
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,920
- Eight hundred and sixty billion?
- Billion.

546
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,480
- That's a lot of money.
- A lot, yeah.

547
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,200
And what percentage of our economy
does that represent?

548
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,640
It seems like a lot.

549
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,560
Well, in terms of investments
on Wall Street in American equities...

550
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,400
...it's roughly 6 or 7 percent
of America.

551
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,080
They own a fairly good slice
of America.

552
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,280
Most of that money goes into
the great blue-chip companies.

553
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,320
Citigroup, Citibank,
the largest stockholder is a Saudi.

554
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,240
AOL-Time Warner has
big Saudi investors.

555
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,480
So I read where, like, the Saudis have
a trillion dollars...

556
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,560
...in our banks of their money.
What would happen...

557
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
...if they pulled that trillion out?

558
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,440
A trillion dollars? That would be
an enormous blow to the economy.

559
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,400
Can I speak to you for a moment,
please, sir?

560
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
- How are you doing?
- Good, how you doing?

561
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,080
Steve Kimball with the Secret Service.
We're just ascertaining information.

562
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,240
Are you doing a documentary
on the Saudi Arabian Embassy?

563
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,440
No. I am doing a documentary,
and part of it is about Saudi Arabia.

564
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,200
Even though we were nowhere near
the White House...

565
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,040
...the Secret Service had shown up
to ask us what we were doing...

566
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,640
...standing across the street
from the Saudi Embassy.

567
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,400
- We're not here to cause any trouble.
- Okay.

568
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,200
- You know. Is that...?
- No, that's fine.

569
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,360
We just wanted to get
some information as far as...

570
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,960
What's going on, yeah.

571
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,280
I didn't realize the Secret Service
guards foreign embassies.

572
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,440
- Not usually, no, sir.
- No. Do they give you any trouble?

573
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,600
- Saudis?
- No comment on that.

574
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,480
Okay, I'll take that as a yes.

575
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,080
Good. Thank you very much.

576
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,840
It turns out that Saudi Prince Bandar
is perhaps...

577
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,360
...the best-protected ambassador
in the U.S.

578
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,600
The U.S. State Department provides
him with a six-man security detail.

579
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Considering how he and his family
and the Saudi elite...

580
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,880
...own 7 percent of America,
it's probably not a bad idea.

581
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,520
Prince Bandar was so close
to the Bushes...

582
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,120
...they considered him a member
of the family.

583
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,480
They even had a nickname for him:
Bandar Bush.

584
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,040
Two nights after September 11 th,
George Bush invited Bandar Bush...

585
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,360
...over to the White House
for a private dinner and a talk.

586
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,120
Even though bin Laden
was a Saudi...

587
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,080
...and Saudi money
had funded al Qaeda...

588
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,880
...and 15 of the 19 hijackers
were Saudis...

589
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,840
...here was the Saudi ambassador,
casually dining with the president...

590
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
...on September 13th.

591
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,680
What were they talking about?

592
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,000
Were they commiserating
or comparing notes?

593
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,160
Why would Bandar's government...

594
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,920
...block American investigators
from talking to the relatives...

595
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,600
...of the 15 hijackers?

596
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,480
Why would Saudi Arabia
become reluctant...

597
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,840
...to freeze the hijackers' assets?

598
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,080
The two of them walked out
on the Truman Balcony...

599
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,800
...so that Bandar could smoke a cigar
and have a drink.

600
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,960
In the distance, across the Potomac,
was the Pentagon, partially in ruins.

601
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,200
I wonder if Mr. Bush
told Prince Bandar not to worry...

602
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,080
...because he already had a plan
in motion.

603
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,280
You come in September 12th...

604
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,520
...to plot our response to al Qaeda.
Let me talk about the response...

605
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,080
...you got from top administration
officials.

606
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,680
On that day, what did the president
say to you?

607
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,200
The president, in a very intimidating
way, left me and my staff...

608
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,240
...with the clear indication
he wanted us to come back...

609
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,400
...with the word that there was
an Iraqi hand behind 9l11.

610
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,320
They planned to do something about
Iraq before they came into office.

611
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,360
Did he ask about any other nations
other than Iraq?

612
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,920
No, not at all. It was, "Iraq, Saddam,
find out, get back to me. "

613
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,640
Were his questions more about Iraq
than al Qaeda?

614
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,080
Absolutely. He didn't ask me
about al Qaeda.

615
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,200
And the reaction you got from
the defense secretary, Rumsfeld...

616
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,760
...from his assistant, Paul Wolfowitz?

617
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,360
Donald Rumsfeld said...
When we talked about bombing...

618
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,760
...the al Qaeda infrastructure
in Afghanistan...

619
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,400
...he said, "There are
no good targets in Afghanistan.

620
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,800
Let's bomb Iraq. "

621
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,560
And we said, "But Iraq had nothing
to do with this. "

622
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,680
That didn't make much difference.
The reason they had...

623
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,520
...to do Afghanistan first was, it was
obvious al Qaeda attacked us.

624
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,640
And it was obvious that al Qaeda
was in Afghanistan.

625
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,280
Americans wouldn't stand by
if we'd done nothing on Afghanistan.

626
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,480
The United States began bombing
Afghanistan...

627
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,240
...just four weeks after 9/11.
Mr. Bush said he was doing so...

628
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,040
...because the Taliban government
of Afghanistan...

629
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,680
...had been harboring bin Laden.

630
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,360
We will smoke them
out of their holes.

631
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,960
We're gonna smoke them out.

632
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,160
- We'll smoke him out of his cave.
- Let's rush them and smoke them out.

633
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,920
For all his tough talk,
Bush really didn't do much.

634
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,080
Well, what they did was slow
and small.

635
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,280
They put only 11,000 troops
into Afghanistan.

636
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
There are more police here
in Manhattan.

637
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,040
More in Manhattan than there are
U.S. Troops in Afghanistan.

638
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,080
The president botched the response.
He should have gone after bin Laden.

639
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,960
The U.S. Special Forces didn't get into
the area where bin Laden was...

640
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,760
...for two months.
- Two months?

641
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,400
A mass murderer who attacked
the United States...

642
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,120
...was given a two-month head start?

643
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,880
Who in their right mind
would do that?

644
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,760
- Dang! Anybody say "nice shot"?
- Nice shot.

645
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,520
Hell of a shot.

646
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,320
Or was the war in Afghanistan
really about something else?

647
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,000
Perhaps the answer
was in Houston, Texas.

648
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,360
In 1997, while George W. Bush
was governor of Texas...

649
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,800
...a delegation of Taliban leaders
from Afghanistan flew to Houston...

650
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,000
...to meet with Unocal executives...

651
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,480
...to discuss the building of a pipeline
through Afghanistan...

652
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,680
...bringing natural gas
from the Caspian Sea.

653
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,240
And who got a Caspian Sea
drilling contract...

654
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,240
...the same day Unocal
signed the pipeline deal?

655
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,280
A company headed by a man
named Dick Cheney. Halliburton.

656
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,560
From the point of view
of the U.S. Government...

657
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,960
...this was kind of a magic pipeline...

658
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,400
...because it could serve
so many purposes.

659
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,920
And who else stood to benefit
from the pipeline?

660
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,360
Bush's number-one campaign
contributor, Kenneth Lay...

661
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,080
...and the good people of Enron.

662
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,120
Only the British press
covered this trip.

663
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,120
Then in 2001, just five and a half
months before 9/11...

664
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,200
...the Bush administration welcomed
a Taliban envoy...

665
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,840
...to tour the United States...

666
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,840
...to help improve the image
of the Taliban government.

667
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,600
You have imprisoned the women.
It's a horror, let me tell you.

668
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm sorry to your husband. He must
have a difficult time with you.

669
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,960
Here is the Taliban official
visiting our State Department...

670
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,240
...to meet with U.S. Officials.

671
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,240
Why would the Bush administration
allow a Taliban leader...

672
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,400
...to visit the United States,
knowing that the Taliban...

673
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,880
...were harboring the man
who bombed the U.S.S. Cole...

674
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,560
...and our African embassies?

675
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,360
Well, I guess 9/11 put a stop to that.

676
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,520
When the invasion of Afghanistan
was complete...

677
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,000
...we installed its new president,
Hamid Karzai.

678
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,480
Who was Hamid Karzai?

679
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,120
He was a former adviser to Unocal.

680
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,240
Bush also appointed,
as our envoy to Afghanistan...

681
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,000
...Zalmay Khalilzad, who was also
a former Unocal adviser.

682
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,640
I guess you can probably see
where this is leading.

683
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,120
Faster than you can say, "Black gold,
Texas tea, " Afghanistan signed...

684
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,600
...an agreement with her
neighboring countries...

685
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,880
...to build a pipeline carrying
natural gas from the Caspian Sea.

686
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,320
Oh, and the Taliban?

687
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,720
Oh, they mostly got away.

688
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,480
As did Osama bin Laden
and most of al Qaeda.

689
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,600
Terror is bigger than one person.

690
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,040
And he's a person who's now
been marginalized.

691
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,760
So I don't know where he is.

692
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,200
I just don't spend that much time
on him, to be honest with you.

693
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,320
Didn't spend much time on him?
What kind of president was he?

694
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,360
I'm a war president. I make decisions
here in the Oval Office...

695
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,840
...in foreign policy matters
with war on my mind.

696
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,920
With the war in Afghanistan over
and bin Laden forgotten...

697
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,600
...the war president had
a new target:

698
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,440
The American people.

699
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,200
We've got an unusual terror warning
from the feds to tell you about.

700
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,480
Fox News has obtained
an FBI bulletin...

701
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,080
...that warns terrorists could use
pen guns, like in James Bond...

702
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
...filled with poison.
- Good evening.

703
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,920
America is on high alert tonight,
just four days before Christmas.

704
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,480
- A possible terror threat.
- As bad as or worse than 9l11.

705
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,280
But where? How?
There's nothing specific to report.

706
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,360
Be on the lookout for model airplanes
packed with explosives.

707
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,600
The FBI is warning ferries may be
considered particularly at risk...

708
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,680
...for hijacking.

709
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,080
Could these cattle be a target
for terrorists?

710
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,720
- Fear works.
- Fear does work, yes.

711
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,480
You can make people do anything
if they're afraid.

712
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,400
And how do you make them afraid?

713
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:23,240
Well, you make them afraid
by creating an aura of endless threat.

714
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,920
They played us like an organ.

715
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:30,000
They raised the orange, up to red,
then they dropped it back to orange.

716
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,160
I mean, they gave these mixed
messages, which were crazy-making.

717
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,640
The world is changed
after September the 11 th.

718
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,120
It's changed because
we're no longer safe.

719
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,480
Fly and enjoy America's
great destination spots.

720
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,680
We have entered what may
prove to be the most dangerous...

721
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,040
...security environment
the world's known.

722
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,760
Take your families and enjoy life.

723
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,120
Terrorists are doing everything
they can...

724
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,520
...to gain even deadlier means
of striking us.

725
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,880
- Go down to Disney World in Florida.
- It's like training a dog.

726
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,880
You tell him sit down and roll over
at the same time, dog doesn't know...

727
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,120
...what to do. American people
were being treated like that.

728
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,080
It was very, very skillfully and ugly,
in what they did.

729
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,640
We must stop the terror.

730
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:23,240
I call upon all nations to do everything
they can to stop these terrorist killers.

731
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,520
Thank you.

732
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,880
Now watch this drive.

733
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,560
All right. You give me another one.

734
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,920
They will continue, in my view, as long
as this administration is in charge...

735
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,280
...of every once in a while,
stimulating everybody to be afraid.

736
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,880
Just in case you forgot.

737
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,360
It's not gonna go down to green
or blue. It's never gonna get there.

738
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,960
There clearly is no way
that anyone...

739
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,400
...can live constantly on edge
like that.

740
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,280
The reality facing
American families...

741
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,960
...is they're not as safe
as they used to be.

742
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,640
Drug dealers and users looking
for their next fix.

743
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,840
Gangs who roam the streets
in search of their next victim.

744
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,600
And the growing threat of terrorists
means the need for protection...

745
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,000
...is ever greater.
And now that protection is here.

746
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,560
Zytech Engineering, LLC has
developed and tested a safe room...

747
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,600
...finally affordable to the average
American citizen.

748
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,520
Protection formerly obtainable
only by the wealthy or powerful.

749
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,280
Heck, you can be sitting in here,
drinking your finest Bordeaux...

750
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,520
...and enjoying life, while chaos
is erupting outside.

751
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,040
Every family in America
should prepare itself...

752
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,880
...for a terrorist attack.

753
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,880
Now to escaping from a skyscraper.
John Rivers is the CEO...

754
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,360
...of the Executive Chute Corporation.
Good morning to you, John.

755
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,520
- Good morning, Matt.
- Tell me about the product.

756
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,800
It's an emergency escape chute.
It's an option of last resort.

757
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,960
How high do you have to be
in the building...

758
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,760
...for that chute to actually
take effect?

759
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,720
You only have to be on the 10th floor
or above.

760
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,920
They can put this on themselves?

761
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,400
Right. They can put this on
themselves in as easy...

762
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,680
...as about 30 seconds.
It's real easy to put on.

763
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,440
- Here.
- Sorry.

764
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,160
That's okay. Real easy to put on,
but...

765
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,520
When you first get this chute,
you're gonna wanna put it on...

766
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,400
...and try it on a few times yourself.
- Jaime's having trouble putting that on.

767
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,960
Is this something that you honestly
think, in a moment of panic...

768
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,440
...that someone can operate
properly?

769
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,200
Oh, yeah. It is. This is actually...
Jamie's probably never...

770
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,600
...put this thing on before in her life.

771
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,960
It's okay. It's something that,
when you get it...

772
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,560
...you're gonna wanna put it on
several times.

773
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,320
Despite the raising of the terror alert
level, residents here continue...

774
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,320
...with their Christmas errands.

775
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,680
Frances and her family do some
last-minute holiday shopping...

776
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,280
...knowing al Qaeda is planning
to attack.

777
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,640
She says being in Saginaw doesn't
make her feel any safer...

778
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,840
...than if she was in New York City.

779
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,200
Midland is close by...

780
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,800
...and I said,
"Detroit's not that far away. "

781
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,840
I said, "That could be something...
And Flint could be something... Be...

782
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,960
...concerns for people around here. "
- You never know...

783
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,120
...where they're gonna hit.
Never know.

784
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,400
But one potential target specifically
mentioned by the terrorists...

785
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,880
...has security officials baffled.
It's tiny Tappahannock, Virginia...

786
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,720
...population, 2016.

787
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,040
Such an attack could generate
widespread fear...

788
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:33,520
...that even here in rural, small-town
America, no one is entirely safe.

789
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,440
On the news there was
an alert in Tappahannock.

790
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,640
- What did the FBI tell you?
- Well, they contacted me by phone.

791
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,120
Basically let me know about this,
were it Tappahannock.

792
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,000
- That's how it started.
- In the so-called chatter they pick up...

793
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,560
...they wasn't sure Tappahannock.
There's a Rappahannock County...

794
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,640
...Rappahannock River.
- There is a Rappahannock...

795
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,440
A place called Rappahannock.
They got it mixed up.

796
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,600
This is Tappahannock,
not Rappahannock.

797
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,880
- Is there any target around here?
- Not that we can think of.

798
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,840
- It can happen anywhere.
- Wal-Mart.

799
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,960
A big spaghetti supper in here.

800
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,400
Wal-Mart, probably.

801
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,000
Do you feel extra suspicious
of outsiders?

802
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,200
Oh, everybody does that.

803
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,280
That's just something that happens.

804
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,880
When I look at certain people,
I wonder, "Oh, my goodness.

805
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,120
Do you think they could be
a terrorist?"

806
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,440
- Never know what's gonna happen.
- Right.

807
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,120
It could happen right now.

808
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,480
Never trust nobody you don't know.

809
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,000
And even if you do know them,
you really can't trust them then.

810
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,360
From Tappahannock
to Rappahannock...

811
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,120
...to every town and village in
America, the people were afraid.

812
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,080
And they turned to their leader
to protect them.

813
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,480
But protect them from what?

814
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,880
Meet John Ashcroft.

815
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,480
In 2000, he was running for
re-election as senator for Missouri...

816
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,840
...against a man who died
the month before the election.

817
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,000
The voters preferred the dead guy.

818
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,760
So George W. Bush made him
his attorney general.

819
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,360
He was sworn in on a stack
of Bibles.

820
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,600
Because when you can't beat
a dead guy...

821
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,000
...you need all the help you can get.

822
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,160
During the summer before 9/11...

823
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,360
...Ashcroft told acting FBI director,
Thomas Pickard...

824
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,240
...that he didn't want to hear
anything more about terrorist threats.

825
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,640
Mr. Watson had come to you and said
that the CIA was very concerned...

826
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,680
...that there would be an attack.

827
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,280
You said that you told the attorney
general this fact repeatedly...

828
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,440
...in these meetings. That correct?

829
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,320
I've told him at least
on two occasions.

830
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,600
And you told the staff,
according to this statement...

831
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,360
...Mr. Ashcroft told you that he did not
want to hear about this anymore.

832
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,240
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

833
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,840
His own FBI knew that summer
there were al Qaeda members...

834
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,880
...in the U.S. And bin Laden was
sending his agents to flight schools...

835
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,680
...around the country.

836
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,360
But Ashcroft's Justice Department
turned a blind eye...

837
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,960
...and a deaf ear.

838
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,320
But after 9/11, John Ashcroft
had some brilliant ideas...

839
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,520
...for how to protect America.

840
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,280
The Patriot Act, adopted by Congress
and signed by Bush...

841
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,160
...six weeks after the attacks...

842
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,640
...has changed the way
the government does business.

843
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:50,120
The Patriot Act allows for searches
of medical and financial records...

844
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,400
...computer and telephone
conversations...

845
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,600
...even for the books you take out of
the library. But people we spoke to...

846
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,040
...say they're willing to give up
liberties to fight terrorism.

847
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,560
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- It's sad, but it has to be done.

848
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,320
Yes, something needed to be done.

849
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,760
These are the good people
who make up Peace Fresno.

850
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,920
A community group
in Fresno, California.

851
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,840
Unlike the rest of us,
they received an early lesson...

852
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,680
...in what the Patriot Act is all about.

853
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,200
Each week, they meet to discuss
matters of peace.

854
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,640
They sit around, they share stories,
they eat cookies.

855
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,400
Some have more than one.

856
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,960
This is Aaron Stokes,
a member of Peace Fresno.

857
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,160
The other members liked him.

858
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,040
He had come to the meetings,
he went with us.

859
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,120
We go out on Friday nights and stand
on a very busy corner in Fresno.

860
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,400
And he had gone with us,
he had handed out fliers.

861
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,680
He went with us in June
to a WTO protest.

862
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,760
Then one day, Aaron didn't show up
to the meeting.

863
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,200
My friend Dan and I were reading
the Sunday newspaper...

864
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,000
...and when I picked up the paper,
in the local section...

865
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,880
...Aaron's picture caught my eye.

866
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,160
The article said that a sheriff's deputy
had been killed...

867
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,840
...and I saw it had a name
that wasn't the right name...

868
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,280
...that said that he was a member
of the sheriff's antiterrorism unit.

869
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,840
That's right.

870
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,560
The photo of the man
in the newspaper...

871
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,040
...was not the Aaron Stokes
they had come to know.

872
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:34,600
He was actually Deputy Aaron Kilner,
and he had infiltrated their group.

873
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,480
Sheriff Pierce made it very clear
that, yes...

874
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,640
...Aaron Kilner was assigned
to infiltrate Peace Fresno...

875
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,040
...that he was able to infiltrate
organizations...

876
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,000
...that are open to the public.

877
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,080
You could understand why the police
needed to spy...

878
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,960
...on a group like Peace Fresno.

879
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,960
Just look at them.

880
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,840
A gathering of terrorists
if I ever saw one.

881
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,400
This is Barry Reingold,
a retired phone worker...

882
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,080
...from Oakland, California.

883
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,160
Barry likes to work out in the gym.

884
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,640
Somewhere between his cardio
and his strength training...

885
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,320
...Barry got political.

886
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,080
We were up in the gym,
and it was after we were working out...

887
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,080
...and a number of us were talking
about 9l11 and Afghanistan...

888
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,640
...and bin Laden, and someone said,
"Bin Laden's a real asshole...

889
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,120
...for murdering those people. "
And I said, "Yeah, that's true.

890
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,760
But he'll never be as big
an asshole as Bush...

891
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,560
...who bombs all over the world
for oil profits. "

892
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,440
Barry didn't have to worry
about the police spying on him.

893
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,520
His fellow weightlifters
were more than willing to turn him in.

894
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:48,400
I was taking a nap, and I guess
it was 1:30, 2:00 in the afternoon.

895
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,640
And they came to my place,
and I said, "Well, who's there?"

896
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,720
And they said, "The FBI."
I said, "The FBI? Why are they here?"

897
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,981
Yes, the FBI had come to see Barry.

898
01:00:00,016 --> 01:00:02,162
And they weren't there to Jazzercise.

899
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:08,827
The FBI said, "Have you been talking
to people about 9l11 and bin Laden...

900
01:00:08,862 --> 01:00:14,012
...and oil profits and Afghanistan?"
I said, "A lot of people are talking...

901
01:00:14,132 --> 01:00:15,934
...about these things. "

902
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:20,017
I feel my rights have been,
you know, trampled on.

903
01:00:20,057 --> 01:00:24,261
I mean, if you have something to say
to me in the gym, well, then, fine.

904
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:29,385
Don't tell the FBI, and they come to
my apartment while I'm taking a nap.

905
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,827
Nothing to be ashamed of.
There's full transparency.

906
01:00:33,629 --> 01:00:36,231
There's nothing about the Patriot Act
I am ashamed of...

907
01:00:36,311 --> 01:00:38,113
...in any way, shape or form.

908
01:00:38,313 --> 01:00:40,315
I have a 1-800 number. Call me.

909
01:00:41,796 --> 01:00:44,398
I'm the guy you call
if there's a violation or an abuse.

910
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,362
If you've got a poster child on this,
I wanna see it.

911
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:51,965
I'm hired by the people to provide
oversight. I provide oversight.

912
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:55,047
Trent Lott said,
the day the bill was introduced:

913
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:59,411
"Maybe now we can do things
we've wanted to do the last 10 years. "

914
01:00:59,771 --> 01:01:04,375
No, a dictatorship would be a heck
of a lot easier, no question about it.

915
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:08,539
I mean, they had all this on the shelf
somewhere.

916
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:13,023
Ideas of things they would like to do.
And they got 9l11...

917
01:01:13,143 --> 01:01:15,665
...and they said, "It's our chance.
Go for it. "

918
01:01:15,825 --> 01:01:17,907
There was an assumption
of the administration...

919
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,113
...that there had to be a surrender
of certain of our rights.

920
01:01:25,273 --> 01:01:27,195
There's troubling definitions
in the bill.

921
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:34,041
The definition of terrorist,
it's so expansive...

922
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:38,204
...that it could include people who...
- Like me.

923
01:01:38,324 --> 01:01:40,807
No one read it.
That's the whole point.

924
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:45,691
They wait till the middle of the night,
drop it in the night, print it in the night.

925
01:01:45,851 --> 01:01:48,333
And the next morning when we
come in, it passes.

926
01:01:48,533 --> 01:01:53,938
How could Congress pass this
Patriot Act without even reading it?

927
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:56,260
Sit down, my son.

928
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,984
We don't read most of the bills.

929
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:04,267
Do you really know what that
would entail...

930
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:08,831
...if we were to read every bill
that we passed?

931
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:15,717
Well, the good thing, it would
slow down the legislative process.

932
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:18,879
I couldn't believe that virtually
no member of Congress...

933
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,722
...had read the Patriot Act
before voting on it.

934
01:02:21,922 --> 01:02:25,245
So I decided the only patriotic thing
to do...

935
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,048
...was for me to read it to them.

936
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,930
Members of Congress,
this is Michael Moore...

937
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:34,813
...I would like to read you
the U.S.A. Patriot Act.

938
01:02:34,973 --> 01:02:36,174
"Section 1:

939
01:02:36,414 --> 01:02:39,817
Section 210 of this code
reads as follows... "

940
01:02:39,977 --> 01:02:41,899
"Section 2703C... "

941
01:02:41,979 --> 01:02:45,582
My job is to secure the homeland.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

942
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:48,545
But I'm here to take
somebody's order.

943
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:50,907
That's you, stretch.
What would you like?

944
01:02:51,107 --> 01:02:53,509
- Right behind you.
- I'm gonna order some ribs.

945
01:02:53,709 --> 01:02:55,911
We all know you can't
secure the homeland...

946
01:02:56,071 --> 01:02:59,074
...on an empty stomach.
And in order to remain secure...

947
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,636
...everyone needs to sacrifice.

948
01:03:02,637 --> 01:03:05,639
Especially little Patrick Hamilton.

949
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:11,604
I'm sure each of us has our own
airport-security horror story.

950
01:03:11,965 --> 01:03:14,287
But here's my favorite.

951
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:18,971
The terrorist threat that was posed
by his mommy's breast milk.

952
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:22,894
I thought if I put a little bit on my lips,
that would be sufficient...

953
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:26,257
...because I'm tasting it.
She looked at me, and I felt like...

954
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:30,100
...she was telling me, "Chug that. "
She goes, "You need to drink more. "

955
01:03:30,261 --> 01:03:32,583
And of a 4-ounce bottle,
I wound up drinking...

956
01:03:32,663 --> 01:03:34,464
...2 more ounces of breast milk...

957
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:37,547
...that then, because it's touched
my lips, has to be tossed.

958
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:40,709
While homeland security
was making sure breast milk...

959
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:42,471
...was kept off our planes...

960
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:46,074
...they were also doing everything
possible to ensure no one...

961
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,116
...could light a firebomb onboard.

962
01:03:48,716 --> 01:03:52,440
- I can bring that on the plane?
- Actually, yes, you're fine.

963
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,641
One too many books of matches.

964
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:57,284
You can have four books
and two lighters.

965
01:03:57,404 --> 01:03:59,205
When we already have
the shoe-bomber...

966
01:04:01,367 --> 01:04:03,169
...who would have blown up
an airplane...

967
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:06,051
...if he had a butane lighter,
according to the FBI...

968
01:04:06,131 --> 01:04:08,734
...why would Transportation Security
say it's okay...

969
01:04:08,934 --> 01:04:11,336
...to take four books of matches
and two lighters...

970
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:14,378
...as you board a plane? I'm guessing
somebody put pressure on...

971
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:18,862
...to say, "When an airplane lands,
people wanna light up...

972
01:04:19,062 --> 01:04:20,864
...so don't take their lighters away. "

973
01:04:20,904 --> 01:04:22,906
Let me see if I got this straight.

974
01:04:23,106 --> 01:04:26,909
Old guys in the gym, bad.
Peace groups in Fresno, bad.

975
01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:28,390
Breast milk, really bad.

976
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:31,593
Matches and lighters on the plane?
Hey, no problem.

977
01:04:31,793 --> 01:04:36,878
Was this really about our safety?
Or was something else going on?

978
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:42,963
This is where the Pacific Ocean
meets the shores of Oregon.

979
01:04:43,123 --> 01:04:48,328
Over 100 miles of beautiful,
open coastline on our border.

980
01:04:48,448 --> 01:04:51,851
And, thanks to the budget
cutbacks...

981
01:04:52,011 --> 01:04:55,494
...the total number of state police
protecting it:

982
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:57,375
One.

983
01:04:58,576 --> 01:05:00,258
Part-time.

984
01:05:00,738 --> 01:05:02,820
Meet Trooper Brooks.

985
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,223
I maybe get a chance to hit
this stretch of highway...

986
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:11,107
...once, maybe twice a week
during my shifts.

987
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:14,590
You know, just to even drive up here
and look.

988
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:18,874
You know, I mean, as far as I know,
there's lots of things they could do.

989
01:05:19,074 --> 01:05:22,477
I don't even wanna suspect,
because it just makes me ill inside.

990
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:26,520
Back at the state trooper patrol office,
thanks to the budget cuts...

991
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,002
...Trooper Kenyon had to come in
on his day off...

992
01:05:29,082 --> 01:05:31,004
...to catch up on some paperwork.

993
01:05:31,164 --> 01:05:34,247
For the most part, especially during
summer, when people show up...

994
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:36,449
...this is what they get.
They close the door.

995
01:05:36,609 --> 01:05:39,011
They can read the sign
about the office closure.

996
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:42,734
It just basically explains
that due to our cutbacks...

997
01:05:42,774 --> 01:05:45,777
...our office is not open
for administrative business.

998
01:05:45,937 --> 01:05:49,460
There's a sign that explains
when the office is closed...

999
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:54,544
...they can use the phone booth
to get in touch with our dispatch.

1000
01:05:55,105 --> 01:05:57,627
Ironically enough, that phone
is a piece of junk.

1001
01:05:57,827 --> 01:06:00,229
It doesn't work very well,
so half the time...

1002
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:03,432
...they pick up the phone
and dispatch gets static.

1003
01:06:03,632 --> 01:06:05,033
They don't hear anything.

1004
01:06:05,514 --> 01:06:08,516
For Tuesday, there'll be
no troop on patrol.

1005
01:06:08,716 --> 01:06:10,718
Wednesday, there'll be no troop
on patrol.

1006
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,880
Thursday, there'll be
no troop on patrol.

1007
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,682
You get calls all the time.

1008
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:16,843
People will call in
a suspicious vehicle...

1009
01:06:16,924 --> 01:06:19,125
...or somebody looking suspicious.

1010
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:22,128
And I don't hardly ever respond
to that anymore.

1011
01:06:22,288 --> 01:06:23,890
I just don't have the time to do it.

1012
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,612
I asked, "How many people do
we have in Oregon...

1013
01:06:26,812 --> 01:06:28,213
...on duty tonight?"

1014
01:06:28,413 --> 01:06:30,615
And we had eight troopers...

1015
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:33,658
...on for the entire state of Oregon,
working.

1016
01:06:35,339 --> 01:06:40,023
I think Oregon is a prime example
that homeland security...

1017
01:06:40,103 --> 01:06:44,107
...is not as secure as what people
would like to believe.

1018
01:06:44,187 --> 01:06:47,910
Nobody's sent me a manual that says,
"Here's how you catch a terrorist. "

1019
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:52,354
If I had that manual, I'd read it.
But I don't. So...

1020
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:54,316
Yeah.

1021
01:06:54,836 --> 01:06:57,719
The Bush administration
didn't hand out a manual...

1022
01:06:57,879 --> 01:07:00,001
...on how to deal
with the terrorist threat...

1023
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:03,844
...because the terrorist threat
wasn't what this was all about.

1024
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:07,007
They just wanted us
to be fearful enough...

1025
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:11,170
...so that we'd get behind
what their real plan was.

1026
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:13,282
Four minutes.

1027
01:07:13,482 --> 01:07:15,284
- Right from the top.
- All right.

1028
01:07:17,766 --> 01:07:20,248
- How much time?
- Three minutes.

1029
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:25,532
- Okay, folks.
- Thirty seconds.

1030
01:07:26,373 --> 01:07:29,376
- Stand by.
- Fifteen seconds.

1031
01:07:31,738 --> 01:07:36,742
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1032
01:07:36,902 --> 01:07:41,106
...four, three, two, one.

1033
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:42,667
My fellow citizens...

1034
01:08:15,495 --> 01:08:18,498
At this hour, American
and coalition forces...

1035
01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:21,380
...are in the early stages
of military operations...

1036
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,822
...to disarm Iraq...

1037
01:08:22,942 --> 01:08:26,625
...to free its people and to defend
the world from grave danger.

1038
01:08:26,785 --> 01:08:29,988
On my orders, coalition forces
have begun striking...

1039
01:08:30,188 --> 01:08:32,710
...selected targets
of military importance...

1040
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:36,473
...to undermine Saddam Hussein's
ability to wage war.

1041
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:01,815
On March 19th, 2003...

1042
01:09:01,895 --> 01:09:05,178
...George W. Bush
and the United States military...

1043
01:09:05,378 --> 01:09:07,900
...invaded the sovereign nation
of Iraq.

1044
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:12,344
A nation that had never attacked
the United States.

1045
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:18,229
A nation that had never threatened
to attack the United States.

1046
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:24,595
A nation that had never murdered
a single American citizen.

1047
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:48,895
We're going to find this...
I think this piece of my neighbor.

1048
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,778
Young girl, age 20.

1049
01:09:52,218 --> 01:09:56,742
I think it's the other part
of her body. That's all.

1050
01:09:58,784 --> 01:10:01,706
There is a lot of innocent civilians
that were killed.

1051
01:10:01,867 --> 01:10:05,750
And I think that is because
the U.S. Army...

1052
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:08,953
...we came in, and we knew
it wasn't gonna be easy.

1053
01:10:09,113 --> 01:10:11,635
And pretty much at first
shot anything that moved.

1054
01:10:11,835 --> 01:10:13,637
When war happens
and fighting starts...

1055
01:10:13,837 --> 01:10:16,439
...it's like we're pumped up,
motivated, ready to go.

1056
01:10:16,639 --> 01:10:17,920
It's the ultimate rush.

1057
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,483
Because you know
you're going into the fight...

1058
01:10:20,603 --> 01:10:23,205
...then you got a good song
playing in the background.

1059
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:27,569
And that gets you real fired up.
Ready to do the job.

1060
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:29,410
You can hook your CD player up...

1061
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:32,012
...to the tank's internal
communications system.

1062
01:10:32,173 --> 01:10:35,095
When you put your helmet on
you can hear it through the helmet.

1063
01:10:35,175 --> 01:10:36,897
This one we listen to the most.

1064
01:10:36,937 --> 01:10:39,859
This is the one... When we travel,
we kill the enemy...

1065
01:10:39,939 --> 01:10:42,461
Drowning Pool.
"Let the bodies hit the floor"...

1066
01:10:42,582 --> 01:10:44,063
...is fitting for the job.

1067
01:10:50,388 --> 01:10:52,070
We picked "the roof is on fire"...

1068
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:55,232
...because it symbolized
Baghdad being on fire.

1069
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:58,956
At the time we wanted it to burn
to get Saddam and his regime out.

1070
01:10:59,116 --> 01:11:03,199
The roof, the roof
The roof is on fire

1071
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,283
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn

1072
01:11:07,443 --> 01:11:10,445
Burn, motherfucker, burn

1073
01:11:21,255 --> 01:11:25,658
This is a totally different picture here
being pushed into the city.

1074
01:11:25,819 --> 01:11:27,940
Urban warfare in a tank.

1075
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:30,222
Civilians.

1076
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:31,944
The civilians...

1077
01:11:32,104 --> 01:11:34,906
You don't know who's friendly,
who's the enemy.

1078
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:38,389
This is a lot more real and true
than just a video game.

1079
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:42,073
People thought it was gonna be, "Look
through the sight and shoot. " No.

1080
01:11:42,113 --> 01:11:43,714
A lot of this is face to face.

1081
01:11:43,914 --> 01:11:47,437
Especially riding by after
some of the bombs went off...

1082
01:11:47,597 --> 01:11:50,600
...and seeing all the people
on the side of the road bloated up.

1083
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,084
And all the smells around you
from the people lying dead, rotted.

1084
01:11:55,204 --> 01:11:57,726
It's a lot more gruesome
than you think.

1085
01:11:57,886 --> 01:12:01,169
We called in with some artillery
and some napalm and things.

1086
01:12:01,369 --> 01:12:03,291
Some innocent women
and children got hit.

1087
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:05,333
We met them on the road,
and they had...

1088
01:12:05,573 --> 01:12:07,975
...little girls with noses
blown off. And...

1089
01:12:08,135 --> 01:12:09,456
And...

1090
01:12:09,656 --> 01:12:12,539
...husbands carrying their dead wives
and things like that.

1091
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:15,621
That was extremely difficult
to deal with. You're like:

1092
01:12:15,701 --> 01:12:18,624
"Shoot. What the hell
do we do now?"

1093
01:12:19,184 --> 01:12:23,468
The targeting capabilities
and the care that goes into targeting...

1094
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:29,834
...is as impressive as anything
anyone could see.

1095
01:12:32,276 --> 01:12:33,677
- Got him.
- Good. Second one.

1096
01:12:33,877 --> 01:12:35,558
Get the other one.

1097
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:41,444
The care that goes into it,
the humanity that goes into it.

1098
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:42,936
Honestly, I think we should
just trust our president...

1099
01:13:43,096 --> 01:13:45,699
...in every decision he makes,
and we should support that.

1100
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:49,222
You know? And be faithful
in what happens.

1101
01:13:49,262 --> 01:13:52,064
- Do you trust this president?
- Yes, I do.

1102
01:13:53,145 --> 01:13:55,747
Britney Spears was not alone.

1103
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:57,629
The majority
of the American people...

1104
01:13:57,789 --> 01:14:01,192
...trusted the president.
And why shouldn't they?

1105
01:14:01,432 --> 01:14:04,155
He'd spent the better part
of the last year...

1106
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:07,918
...giving them every reason
why we should invade Iraq.

1107
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:11,161
Saddam Hussein has gone
to elaborate lengths...

1108
01:14:11,361 --> 01:14:13,082
...spent enormous sums...

1109
01:14:13,122 --> 01:14:17,726
...taken great risks to build and keep
weapons of mass destruction.

1110
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:21,850
Saddam Hussein is determined
to get his hands on a nuclear bomb.

1111
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:24,372
Nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapon.
Nuclear weapon.

1112
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:29,216
Active chemical munitions bunkers.
Mobile production facilities.

1113
01:14:29,376 --> 01:14:31,178
We know he's got
chemical weapons.

1114
01:14:31,378 --> 01:14:33,380
He's got them. He's got them.
He's got them.

1115
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,461
Huh, that's weird.

1116
01:14:35,662 --> 01:14:39,265
Because that's not what Bush's
people said when he first took office.

1117
01:14:40,946 --> 01:14:42,467
He hasn't developed capability...

1118
01:14:42,628 --> 01:14:44,709
...with respect to weapons
of mass destruction.

1119
01:14:44,909 --> 01:14:48,112
He's unable to project conventional
power against his neighbors.

1120
01:14:49,674 --> 01:14:52,996
We're able to keep arms from him.
Military forces haven't been rebuilt.

1121
01:14:53,036 --> 01:14:57,040
Saddam Hussein aids
and protects terrorists...

1122
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,362
...including members of al Qaeda.

1123
01:14:59,522 --> 01:15:02,525
There was a relationship
between Iraq and al Qaeda.

1124
01:15:02,685 --> 01:15:04,967
Saddam. Al Qaeda.
Saddam. Al Qaeda.

1125
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,570
Saddam. The al Qaeda. Saddam.
Saddam. Saddam. Al Qaeda.

1126
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:11,052
It's only a matter of time
before terrorist states...

1127
01:15:11,252 --> 01:15:13,254
...armed with weapons
of mass destruction...

1128
01:15:13,414 --> 01:15:16,897
...develop the capability to deliver
those weapons to U.S. Cities.

1129
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:19,339
We're giving you facts
and conclusions...

1130
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:21,301
...based on solid intelligence.

1131
01:15:25,064 --> 01:15:26,585
He's a man who hates America.

1132
01:15:26,785 --> 01:15:29,588
This is a man who cannot stand
what we stand for.

1133
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:33,111
There's willingness
to terrorize himself.

1134
01:15:33,271 --> 01:15:36,554
He hates the fact, like al Qaeda does,
that we love freedom.

1135
01:15:36,754 --> 01:15:39,676
After all, this is a guy that tried
to kill my dad at one time.

1136
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:46,442
They got people to believe there was
a threat when in fact there wasn't one.

1137
01:15:46,602 --> 01:15:49,205
You get told things every day
that don't happen.

1138
01:15:49,365 --> 01:15:50,966
It doesn't seem to bother people.

1139
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:54,049
The Democrats were there to put
a stop to all these falsehoods.

1140
01:15:56,971 --> 01:15:58,973
I'll vote to give the president
authority he needs.

1141
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:03,217
United States is prepared to lead the
coalition of the willing that will do it.

1142
01:16:03,377 --> 01:16:05,779
When I say we will lead
a coalition of the willing...

1143
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:08,581
...to disarm him if he chooses
not to disarm, I mean it.

1144
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:12,465
- Who's in that coalition of the willing?
- You will find out who's in it.

1145
01:16:13,706 --> 01:16:16,228
The coalition of the willing.

1146
01:16:16,428 --> 01:16:17,629
Roll call.

1147
01:16:17,829 --> 01:16:20,832
The Republic of Palau.

1148
01:16:20,992 --> 01:16:25,276
The Republic of Costa Rica.

1149
01:16:25,356 --> 01:16:29,159
The Republic of Iceland.

1150
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:33,202
None of these countries has an army,
or for that matter, weapons.

1151
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:37,326
So it looked like we'd be doing
most of the invading stuff ourselves.

1152
01:16:38,487 --> 01:16:42,090
- Then there was also:
- Romania.

1153
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:46,934
The Kingdom of Morocco.

1154
01:16:47,094 --> 01:16:50,097
Morocco wasn't officially
a member of the coalition...

1155
01:16:50,257 --> 01:16:53,460
...but according to one report, they did
offer to send 2000 monkeys...

1156
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,622
...to help detonate land mines.

1157
01:16:57,223 --> 01:16:58,945
These are men of vision.

1158
01:16:58,985 --> 01:17:00,706
The Netherlands.

1159
01:17:00,786 --> 01:17:02,588
And I'm proud to call them allies.

1160
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:06,151
Afghanistan.

1161
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:08,152
Afghanistan?

1162
01:17:08,232 --> 01:17:10,514
Oh, yeah. They had an army.

1163
01:17:10,675 --> 01:17:14,678
Our army. I guess that's one way
to build a coalition.

1164
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:17,240
Just keep invading countries.

1165
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,644
Yes, with our mighty coalition intact,
we were ready.

1166
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:25,407
One could almost say
it's the mother of all coalitions.

1167
01:17:28,049 --> 01:17:31,052
Fortunately, we have an independent
media in this country...

1168
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:33,214
...who would tell us the truth.

1169
01:17:33,294 --> 01:17:37,377
The rallying around the president,
the flag and the troops has begun.

1170
01:17:37,498 --> 01:17:39,099
And we're gonna win!

1171
01:17:39,139 --> 01:17:41,741
You have to be with troops
to understand the adrenaline.

1172
01:17:41,941 --> 01:17:44,464
I want you to know,
I think Navy SEALs rock.

1173
01:17:44,504 --> 01:17:47,626
The pictures you're seeing
are absolutely phenomenal.

1174
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:52,270
When my country's at war,
I want my country to win.

1175
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:55,873
Iraqi opposition has faded
in the face of American power.

1176
01:17:56,033 --> 01:18:00,437
What you're watching here is truly
historic television and journalism.

1177
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:01,999
It was absolutely electrifying.

1178
01:18:02,199 --> 01:18:05,602
They had to strap me in with my
camera at the back of the plane.

1179
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:08,084
An awesome, synchronized
killing machine.

1180
01:18:08,244 --> 01:18:09,725
There is an inherent bias...

1181
01:18:09,925 --> 01:18:12,648
...in the coverage of the American
press in general.

1182
01:18:12,728 --> 01:18:15,130
Am I slanted and biased?
You damn well bet I am.

1183
01:18:19,374 --> 01:18:21,976
But one story the media
wasn't covering...

1184
01:18:22,176 --> 01:18:23,857
...was the personal story...

1185
01:18:24,018 --> 01:18:27,420
...of each and every soldier
who was killed in the war.

1186
01:18:27,581 --> 01:18:30,063
The government would not allow
any cameras...

1187
01:18:30,223 --> 01:18:32,425
...to show the coffins coming home.

1188
01:18:33,145 --> 01:18:35,828
That kind of story is a downer...

1189
01:18:35,908 --> 01:18:39,791
...especially when you're getting
ready for a party on a boat.

1190
01:19:21,987 --> 01:19:23,188
My fellow Americans...

1191
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:28,153
...major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

1192
01:19:28,353 --> 01:19:30,154
In the battle of Iraq...

1193
01:19:30,314 --> 01:19:35,119
...the United States
and our allies have prevailed.

1194
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:47,930
Get out of the way!

1195
01:19:55,176 --> 01:19:58,459
Move! Move! Move! Move!

1196
01:20:18,195 --> 01:20:21,198
162, the number of troops
killed by hostile fire.

1197
01:20:21,398 --> 01:20:25,081
- 244 U.S. Troops...
- 384 U.S. Troops lost their lives...

1198
01:20:25,161 --> 01:20:28,164
- Total killed, 484.
- Died in the line of duty, 500...

1199
01:20:28,244 --> 01:20:29,565
631 American troops...

1200
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:32,007
More than 825 troops
have been killed in Iraq.

1201
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:35,010
The largest number of American
military deaths since Vietnam.

1202
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:41,175
There are some who feel like
that if they attack us...

1203
01:20:41,335 --> 01:20:43,938
...that we may decide
to leave prematurely.

1204
01:20:44,698 --> 01:20:47,100
They don't understand,
if that's the case.

1205
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,102
Let me finish.

1206
01:20:49,983 --> 01:20:54,186
There are some who feel like
the conditions are such...

1207
01:20:54,347 --> 01:20:56,148
...that they can attack us there.

1208
01:20:56,348 --> 01:20:58,030
My answer is, bring them on.

1209
01:21:11,962 --> 01:21:14,764
The United States was planning
on walking through here...

1210
01:21:14,924 --> 01:21:17,246
...like it was gonna be easy and all.

1211
01:21:17,446 --> 01:21:20,649
But it's not that easy
to conquer a country, is it?

1212
01:21:27,135 --> 01:21:31,138
The renewed battle for control
of Iraq raged for a fourth day today...

1213
01:21:31,298 --> 01:21:34,581
...with street clashes in nearly
every corner of the country.

1214
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:37,343
Iraq could become "another Vietnam. "

1215
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:40,987
Officials say they see evidence
that Sunni and Shiite extremists...

1216
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:42,668
...might be joining forces.

1217
01:21:42,748 --> 01:21:44,870
They're not happy they're occupied.

1218
01:21:45,831 --> 01:21:48,433
I wouldn't be happy
if I were occupied either.

1219
01:21:57,961 --> 01:22:00,243
Two Japanese aid workers
and a journalist...

1220
01:22:00,403 --> 01:22:02,405
...kidnapped by men calling
themselves...

1221
01:22:02,605 --> 01:22:04,527
...the Mujahideen Squadrons.

1222
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:06,769
They threatened to burn
the hostages alive...

1223
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:11,172
...if Japan does not withdraw its troops
from Iraq within three days.

1224
01:22:11,733 --> 01:22:13,334
What's happened?

1225
01:22:15,656 --> 01:22:16,937
They attacked our convoy.

1226
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:19,259
You wanna give us your name?

1227
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:22,422
Hamill, Thomas.

1228
01:22:23,423 --> 01:22:26,626
The Pentagon might keep up
to 24,000 troops in combat...

1229
01:22:26,786 --> 01:22:28,067
...beyond their tour.

1230
01:22:28,267 --> 01:22:30,589
I know our numbers
in the military have gone down.

1231
01:22:30,749 --> 01:22:32,431
They talk about retention.

1232
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:36,194
I never expected
to be deployed this long.

1233
01:22:36,394 --> 01:22:37,715
I don't think anybody did.

1234
01:22:37,955 --> 01:22:40,878
I don't have any clue
as to why we're still in Iraq.

1235
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:44,321
If Donald Rumsfeld was here,
I'd ask him for his resignation.

1236
01:22:45,602 --> 01:22:47,604
With the war not going
as planned...

1237
01:22:48,084 --> 01:22:50,887
...and the military in need
of many more troops...

1238
01:22:51,647 --> 01:22:54,169
...where would they find
the new recruits?

1239
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:56,371
Military experts say three times...

1240
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:58,773
...the 120,000 U.S. Troops
now deployed...

1241
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:02,857
...would be needed to pacify
and rebuild the country.

1242
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:06,820
They would find them
all across America...

1243
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:10,583
...in the places that had been
destroyed by the economy.

1244
01:23:11,064 --> 01:23:13,666
Places where one
of the only jobs available...

1245
01:23:13,866 --> 01:23:15,748
...was to join the Army.

1246
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:19,031
Places like my hometown
of Flint, Michigan.

1247
01:23:19,071 --> 01:23:20,792
I was watching TV one day...

1248
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:24,876
...and they showed some of the areas
that had been hit by bombs.

1249
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:27,038
And while watching,
I got to thinking...

1250
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:29,440
...there's parts of Flint
that look like that.

1251
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,121
And we ain't been in a war.

1252
01:23:31,762 --> 01:23:33,643
Look at the neighborhood I live in.

1253
01:23:33,763 --> 01:23:36,165
Most of them are abandoned.
You know, I mean...

1254
01:23:36,326 --> 01:23:38,928
...that's not right.
You wanna talk about terrorism?

1255
01:23:39,128 --> 01:23:42,411
Come right here. President Bush,
right here. Come right here.

1256
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:44,973
He knows about this corner.
I e-mailed him.

1257
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:48,256
At the end of January of '04...

1258
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:51,138
...the unemployment rate
in Flint was 17 percent.

1259
01:23:51,258 --> 01:23:53,861
But you have to take
into consideration as well...

1260
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:56,983
...that when your unemployment
runs out you're no longer counted.

1261
01:23:57,143 --> 01:24:00,226
I would say that we're close
to at least 50 percent...

1262
01:24:00,386 --> 01:24:03,189
...not working or underemployed.

1263
01:24:03,389 --> 01:24:06,311
Because being underemployed
is just as dangerous.

1264
01:24:06,872 --> 01:24:09,154
My family has gone through
the welfare system...

1265
01:24:09,354 --> 01:24:10,675
...when it was Job Central.

1266
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:13,958
In the mid-'80s I came through
the job training partnership program.

1267
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,322
I went to a secretary school.

1268
01:24:18,522 --> 01:24:22,125
Years later, I'm executive assistant
to the president of the agency.

1269
01:24:22,285 --> 01:24:23,886
Interesting.

1270
01:24:24,006 --> 01:24:25,888
My mother used to tell me
all the time:

1271
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:28,170
"Why do you always go
for the underdog?"

1272
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:30,572
It was because the underdog
is who needed me.

1273
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:34,215
People that don't have anything,
that's who I have to fight for.

1274
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,577
And that's who I have fought for
my entire life.

1275
01:24:36,777 --> 01:24:39,700
I started taking my children
and telling my children:

1276
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:41,261
"The military is a good option.

1277
01:24:41,461 --> 01:24:44,464
I can't afford to have you
go to college. I can't pay your way.

1278
01:24:44,504 --> 01:24:46,105
Financial aid will not help you. "

1279
01:24:46,306 --> 01:24:48,708
So I, as a mother,
started teaching my children...

1280
01:24:48,948 --> 01:24:51,150
...about the options
that the military could do.

1281
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:53,031
They would take them
around the world.

1282
01:24:53,232 --> 01:24:56,434
They'd see all the things that I,
as a mother, couldn't let them see.

1283
01:24:56,594 --> 01:25:00,478
It'd pay for their education that I, as
their mother and father, couldn't pay.

1284
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:03,160
The military is a good option
for kids in Flint.

1285
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,323
The military is an excellent option
for the people of Flint.

1286
01:25:07,884 --> 01:25:11,487
How many of you have a friend
or a family member in the service?

1287
01:25:13,049 --> 01:25:15,531
Anybody currently serving
overseas?

1288
01:25:15,691 --> 01:25:17,492
- A brother of mine.
- My cousin.

1289
01:25:17,693 --> 01:25:18,894
Yeah, cousin.

1290
01:25:19,094 --> 01:25:21,015
- Where's your brother?
- Iraq.

1291
01:25:21,055 --> 01:25:22,977
Germany.

1292
01:25:23,057 --> 01:25:27,181
My cousin got shipped off
to Iraq, like, three days ago.

1293
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:28,782
Dang.

1294
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:31,184
There's, like, an Army
or Navy recruiter...

1295
01:25:31,344 --> 01:25:34,747
...or Marines recruiter up there
almost every week...

1296
01:25:35,388 --> 01:25:39,391
...in the lunchroom recruiting
students at the lunchroom.

1297
01:25:39,952 --> 01:25:43,355
There are people with a calling.

1298
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:50,841
Most serve one weekend a month
and two weeks a year.

1299
01:25:52,883 --> 01:25:54,604
Earning money for college.

1300
01:25:58,367 --> 01:26:00,769
Protecting their community.

1301
01:26:02,131 --> 01:26:04,413
In the Army National Guard...

1302
01:26:04,933 --> 01:26:06,214
...you can.

1303
01:26:09,217 --> 01:26:10,538
I'm going into the Air Force.

1304
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:13,701
I'm gonna take a year off
after high school.

1305
01:26:13,861 --> 01:26:17,264
And then make a career. I wanna be
an aircraft maintenance technician.

1306
01:26:17,424 --> 01:26:20,426
I ran into a recruiter, and there
was something I noticed about it.

1307
01:26:20,586 --> 01:26:23,269
And this is kind of on another...
I noticed it was odd.

1308
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:26,191
More like he was hiring me
than recruiting me for the Army.

1309
01:26:26,351 --> 01:26:29,434
It was the way he approached me.
I was in Borders Books and Music.

1310
01:26:29,634 --> 01:26:31,836
He came up like he was handing
us a business card.

1311
01:26:31,996 --> 01:26:34,518
He had business cards
made for the Army.

1312
01:26:39,843 --> 01:26:42,325
Meet Marine Staff
Sergeant Dale Kortman...

1313
01:26:42,565 --> 01:26:44,567
...and Sergeant Raymond Plouhar.

1314
01:26:45,728 --> 01:26:49,732
They are two of the many recruiters
assigned to Flint, Michigan.

1315
01:26:50,092 --> 01:26:52,094
They're very busy these days.

1316
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:54,295
Look, he's running away already.

1317
01:26:54,496 --> 01:26:57,098
- He's seen us coming.
- Yeah.

1318
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,580
What have we got here?

1319
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,982
- Need a little gangster.
- Yeah.

1320
01:27:02,422 --> 01:27:05,145
We're heading over
to the Courtland Mall right now.

1321
01:27:06,186 --> 01:27:08,107
They decided not to go
to the wealthier...

1322
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:10,589
...Genesee Valley Mall
in the suburbs.

1323
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,672
They have a hard time
recruiting young people there.

1324
01:27:13,752 --> 01:27:17,155
Instead, they went
to the other mall.

1325
01:27:17,235 --> 01:27:19,917
- Let's go in through Mervyn's.
- In through Mervyn's.

1326
01:27:20,118 --> 01:27:23,921
And then we'll walk straight down
and straight back and then go down...

1327
01:27:24,321 --> 01:27:26,323
Gents, you know
we're looking at you, right?

1328
01:27:26,443 --> 01:27:28,164
You guys ever think
about joining up?

1329
01:27:28,245 --> 01:27:30,847
I thought about going to college
and playing basketball.

1330
01:27:31,007 --> 01:27:33,409
- You any good?
- Yeah. Especially basketball.

1331
01:27:33,609 --> 01:27:35,731
Good. You can play ball
for the Marine Corps.

1332
01:27:35,891 --> 01:27:38,694
Travel around the world
for the Corps basketball team.

1333
01:27:38,894 --> 01:27:41,296
- David Robinson was in the military.
- Oh, was he?

1334
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,137
Yeah, you can definitely hook it up.

1335
01:27:43,338 --> 01:27:46,861
Right now somebody out there wants
to be a Marine but has no idea how to.

1336
01:27:47,021 --> 01:27:49,223
- Where you work at?
- I work at KFC.

1337
01:27:49,303 --> 01:27:52,505
- Sweet. Hook us up with deals.
- Yes.

1338
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:54,387
They're waiting to get recruited.

1339
01:27:54,587 --> 01:27:56,669
I was gonna try a career
in music or something.

1340
01:27:56,829 --> 01:28:00,152
Career in music? Maybe we can
get you a career in music.

1341
01:28:00,352 --> 01:28:03,155
Let the Marines go for it.
I'm sure you know who Shaggy is.

1342
01:28:03,635 --> 01:28:07,558
- You know anything about him?
- Yeah, he's the Jamaican singer.

1343
01:28:07,598 --> 01:28:09,720
How about a former Marine?

1344
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,402
- Oh.
- Did you know it?

1345
01:28:11,562 --> 01:28:14,284
You need to know discipline
if you're gonna get into music.

1346
01:28:14,364 --> 01:28:16,166
Especially discipline
with the money.

1347
01:28:16,326 --> 01:28:18,728
If you make a million, you need
to manage that money.

1348
01:28:18,848 --> 01:28:20,449
Come to the office, we can talk...

1349
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:22,491
...show you everything
about the Marines.

1350
01:28:22,691 --> 01:28:25,013
- A plan?
- What you got going this afternoon?

1351
01:28:25,173 --> 01:28:27,856
How about tomorrow?
10:00 Monday morning?

1352
01:28:28,056 --> 01:28:30,978
- That sounds pretty good.
- You want me to pick you up?

1353
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,621
It's better to get them
when they're in ones and twos...

1354
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:35,542
...and work on them that way.

1355
01:28:35,742 --> 01:28:36,944
Ladies, ready to join up?

1356
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:39,105
Green hat right behind us.

1357
01:28:39,306 --> 01:28:42,909
- Looks young. He's young.
- Yeah.

1358
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:45,271
We got two over here...

1359
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:47,312
...right over by the red van.

1360
01:28:47,433 --> 01:28:49,634
You go that way, I go this way,
we corner them.

1361
01:28:49,714 --> 01:28:51,716
- You're in the ninth grade?
- Yes, sir.

1362
01:28:51,876 --> 01:28:54,679
Man, you look older
than ninth grade.

1363
01:28:54,879 --> 01:28:56,600
All right, here's my card.

1364
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,642
You ever thought about
being a Marine, man?

1365
01:28:58,842 --> 01:29:01,164
I've thought about it.
I've got a wife and kid now.

1366
01:29:01,324 --> 01:29:02,926
Even more reason to join up.

1367
01:29:03,126 --> 01:29:04,727
What I want to do, man...

1368
01:29:04,928 --> 01:29:08,010
...is get information from you
so I can scratch you off my list...

1369
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:11,773
...saying I've talked to you, and
you're not interested. Is that cool?

1370
01:29:11,853 --> 01:29:14,256
What's your name? Phone number?
What's your address?

1371
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,897
Add another one to the list.

1372
01:29:16,057 --> 01:29:20,661
However, one would love to have
that chance to experience college life.

1373
01:29:20,701 --> 01:29:23,904
You know, stuff young people
can do without having the risk...

1374
01:29:24,024 --> 01:29:27,307
...of dying in the process,
I guess I can say candidly.

1375
01:29:29,589 --> 01:29:33,872
The holidays add a bit more friction,
as opposed to just another night...

1376
01:29:34,033 --> 01:29:38,236
...in the fact we wanna give our guys
a little time off, time to relax.

1377
01:29:38,316 --> 01:29:42,320
However, we are in a combat zone,
and my soldiers do recognize that fact.

1378
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,562
Everybody's a little bit
nervous about it, I guess.

1379
01:29:45,642 --> 01:29:48,645
We're professionals.
We're gonna take care of you.

1380
01:29:49,686 --> 01:29:51,608
I promise.

1381
01:29:52,689 --> 01:29:56,612
Every house here has the right
to have weapons.

1382
01:29:56,772 --> 01:29:58,974
Maximum, one AK-47.

1383
01:29:59,174 --> 01:30:02,057
We always expect the targets
to be armed.

1384
01:30:08,502 --> 01:30:10,504
Rock 'n' roll.

1385
01:30:12,345 --> 01:30:15,268
These are fucking bolt cutters.

1386
01:30:15,428 --> 01:30:17,710
This goddamn thing
to pry doors open.

1387
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,832
Pop this in there...

1388
01:30:56,263 --> 01:30:58,185
Hey, Adele, just hold up.

1389
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,312
No, no, no, no.

1390
01:31:06,472 --> 01:31:08,153
Where's she going?

1391
01:31:08,914 --> 01:31:10,715
- I'll go with her.
- Where's she going?

1392
01:31:10,876 --> 01:31:12,077
She's gonna call him.

1393
01:31:12,277 --> 01:31:16,160
She's gonna call him? No, no, no.
Where is he at right now?

1394
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,122
Not on the phone.
Not on the phone.

1395
01:31:18,242 --> 01:31:21,325
Is he in the house?
Is he in the house?

1396
01:31:21,485 --> 01:31:23,807
- Passerelli! Passerelli!
- Is he in the house?

1397
01:31:24,007 --> 01:31:26,209
He is? He is in the house? Where?

1398
01:31:26,369 --> 01:31:28,451
- This is him?
- Get up there, second floor!

1399
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:31,653
Watch out. Go, go, go!
Watch out, Adele, watch out.

1400
01:31:31,814 --> 01:31:33,535
I have one coming up.

1401
01:31:35,977 --> 01:31:38,579
That's Suheib Al Douri?

1402
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,382
- What's your name?
- Suheib.

1403
01:31:41,542 --> 01:31:43,944
- This is Suheib. Yeah.
- This is Suheib.

1404
01:31:44,144 --> 01:31:45,946
- This is Suheib?
- Yeah.

1405
01:31:46,866 --> 01:31:48,748
Stand him up. Get up.

1406
01:31:52,712 --> 01:31:57,836
Tell them to calm down, please.
We will not be long.

1407
01:32:01,559 --> 01:32:03,961
We appreciate your cooperation.
This is the target.

1408
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:06,643
Suheib Al Douri. Bring him out.

1409
01:32:06,724 --> 01:32:09,126
We have to, as you go back
to the old saying...

1410
01:32:09,326 --> 01:32:11,928
...win the hearts and minds
of the people. That's our job.

1411
01:32:12,048 --> 01:32:15,251
We have to... We have to bring the...

1412
01:32:15,331 --> 01:32:18,654
The ideal of democracy
and freedom to the country...

1413
01:32:18,814 --> 01:32:22,617
...and show them that the American
people are not here to rule Iraq.

1414
01:32:41,073 --> 01:32:44,876
I start doing evidence turn-in.
That process takes about three hours.

1415
01:32:45,076 --> 01:32:46,878
So that's gonna be it for the night.

1416
01:32:46,918 --> 01:32:50,041
That concludes Christmas Eve.

1417
01:32:53,484 --> 01:32:55,285
Merry Christmas, PRT.
Merry Christmas.

1418
01:32:55,485 --> 01:32:57,607
Santa came to Iraq
just for you guys.

1419
01:32:57,767 --> 01:32:59,649
Trying to keep skies
clear for you, Santa.

1420
01:33:02,131 --> 01:33:04,213
Do you consider yourself
a proud American?

1421
01:33:04,373 --> 01:33:05,654
Absolutely.

1422
01:33:05,814 --> 01:33:09,137
I'm an extremely proud American.
I'm probably more proud...

1423
01:33:09,337 --> 01:33:10,618
...than the average Joe.

1424
01:33:10,738 --> 01:33:14,342
When I put my flag out,
I can't allow it to touch the ground.

1425
01:33:14,382 --> 01:33:17,905
Because I know the lives that were lost
and the blood that was shed...

1426
01:33:18,065 --> 01:33:19,946
...so that I could be here
and have a flag.

1427
01:33:20,147 --> 01:33:23,549
- How often do you put the flag out?
- Every single day. Every day.

1428
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:26,672
I started when my daughter
was in Desert Storm.

1429
01:33:26,832 --> 01:33:28,354
I had the same flag...

1430
01:33:28,554 --> 01:33:31,957
...flying on my front porch
and the same yellow ribbons.

1431
01:33:32,117 --> 01:33:35,119
Praying and hoping every day
that my child would come home safe.

1432
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,321
And everybody's child
would come home safe.

1433
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:39,083
- And she did.
- And she did.

1434
01:33:39,283 --> 01:33:41,485
Have other family members
been in the military?

1435
01:33:41,685 --> 01:33:43,286
Absolutely. Uncles, aunts...

1436
01:33:44,888 --> 01:33:46,569
...cousins, brothers, father.

1437
01:33:46,649 --> 01:33:48,651
- Very strong military family.
- Very strong.

1438
01:33:48,851 --> 01:33:52,054
My family was...
My family is what I consider...

1439
01:33:52,214 --> 01:33:54,016
...part of the backbone of America.

1440
01:33:54,096 --> 01:33:56,618
It's families like mine.
And it's not just my family.

1441
01:33:56,778 --> 01:33:59,380
There's hundreds of families,
millions of families...

1442
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,982
...that this country was founded
on their backs.

1443
01:34:02,022 --> 01:34:05,546
I have been known to be
a conservative Democrat. Yeah.

1444
01:34:05,746 --> 01:34:07,747
That's what you consider
yourself? Yeah.

1445
01:34:07,908 --> 01:34:11,190
- Yeah, it's a great country.
- It's a great country. A great country.

1446
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:16,155
The cross that I choose to wear
is a multicultural, multicolor cross.

1447
01:34:16,315 --> 01:34:19,517
That's because I believe that all
God's people come in many colors.

1448
01:34:19,678 --> 01:34:22,080
And my family itself is multicultural.

1449
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,923
You have a daughter
who went into the military.

1450
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:28,285
Then your first-born son,
in the military.

1451
01:34:28,485 --> 01:34:34,010
That's quite a gift to the country
from your family.

1452
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:36,572
So having a son in the Army,
pretty proud thing.

1453
01:34:36,692 --> 01:34:39,895
Oh, you know what? He made it.

1454
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:45,099
What was your reaction to protestors
during the Gulf War or Vietnam?

1455
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:46,941
I always hated the protestors.

1456
01:34:47,101 --> 01:34:51,225
I always hated the protestors.
It was just a slap in my face.

1457
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:55,388
It was just like they were
dishonoring my son.

1458
01:34:55,468 --> 01:34:59,272
And I burned in my soul
to tell them, "You don't understand.

1459
01:34:59,392 --> 01:35:01,594
They're not there because
they wanna be there. "

1460
01:35:01,754 --> 01:35:05,237
But then I came to understand
they weren't protesting the men...

1461
01:35:05,437 --> 01:35:09,440
...and women there. They were
protesting the concept of the war.

1462
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:12,523
I know I'm a soldier,
and I'm here to do a job.

1463
01:35:13,364 --> 01:35:15,966
I've been a soldier for a while.

1464
01:35:17,327 --> 01:35:20,250
Once you have to go
and do your job...

1465
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:22,852
...and you see the things
that you see...

1466
01:35:24,693 --> 01:35:27,496
...I was saying, there's some
disillusionment in that.

1467
01:35:27,656 --> 01:35:32,060
Battalion commander fully
expects us to be...

1468
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:35,022
...attacked in some type of way...

1469
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:37,384
...before we get to FARP Shell.

1470
01:35:38,225 --> 01:35:41,228
I know that so far
it's been pretty calm.

1471
01:35:41,308 --> 01:35:42,709
Not much has happened.

1472
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:47,713
But be aware that it can,
and it probably will.

1473
01:35:52,077 --> 01:35:54,999
They're beginning to organize
themselves, just in neighborhoods.

1474
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,603
The kids get together a lot.
Well, I can't say kids...

1475
01:35:58,643 --> 01:36:00,244
...but guys about 17, 18...

1476
01:36:00,364 --> 01:36:01,965
...starting to come together.

1477
01:36:02,126 --> 01:36:04,528
They hate us.
Why, I'm not really sure.

1478
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:11,293
Immoral behavior
breeds immoral behavior.

1479
01:36:11,934 --> 01:36:14,336
When a president commits
the immoral act...

1480
01:36:14,576 --> 01:36:18,900
...of sending otherwise good kids
to war based on a lie...

1481
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:20,862
...this is what you get.

1482
01:36:21,062 --> 01:36:23,544
Hey, is he ticklish?

1483
01:36:23,624 --> 01:36:25,506
Don't tell me you don't know.

1484
01:36:45,563 --> 01:36:48,686
To have these people
shoot at us, kill us, blow us up...

1485
01:36:48,846 --> 01:36:50,847
...whatever, means they can.

1486
01:36:51,048 --> 01:36:52,649
And I don't understand it.

1487
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:55,451
We're trying to help these people,
and it seems...

1488
01:36:55,651 --> 01:36:57,733
...they don't want our help.
"Get out of here!"

1489
01:36:57,853 --> 01:37:00,656
The minute something goes wrong,
"Why weren't you here?

1490
01:37:00,776 --> 01:37:02,858
Why didn't you do this?"
You know, it's...

1491
01:37:03,018 --> 01:37:05,020
I hate this country.

1492
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:09,223
You know, you... I feel
that a part of your soul...

1493
01:37:10,104 --> 01:37:14,588
...is destroyed in taking another life.

1494
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:18,751
Yeah, that statement is very true.

1495
01:37:18,911 --> 01:37:22,314
You cannot kill someone
without killing a part of yourself.

1496
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:24,076
If you get called up...

1497
01:37:24,196 --> 01:37:26,078
...will you go back to Iraq?
- No.

1498
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:31,242
What repercussions
do you face if you don't?

1499
01:37:31,482 --> 01:37:33,004
Possible jail time.

1500
01:37:33,164 --> 01:37:34,565
That's one possible thing.

1501
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:37,447
- Are you willing to risk that?
- Yes.

1502
01:37:37,527 --> 01:37:39,209
Yes, I...

1503
01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:43,132
I will not let my person...

1504
01:37:44,373 --> 01:37:47,576
I will not let anyone...

1505
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:51,139
...send me back over there
to kill other poor people.

1506
01:37:51,339 --> 01:37:56,944
Especially when they pose
no threat to me and my country.

1507
01:38:01,068 --> 01:38:02,669
I won't do it.

1508
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:06,352
This is an impressive crowd.
The haves...

1509
01:38:06,552 --> 01:38:08,834
...and the have-mores.

1510
01:38:10,716 --> 01:38:13,118
Some people call you the elite.

1511
01:38:13,278 --> 01:38:15,480
I call you my base.

1512
01:38:23,287 --> 01:38:25,809
While Bush was busy
taking care of his base...

1513
01:38:26,009 --> 01:38:28,211
...and professing his love
for our troops...

1514
01:38:28,371 --> 01:38:32,455
...he proposed cutting combat
soldiers' pay by 33 percent...

1515
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:35,337
...and assistance to their families
by 60 percent.

1516
01:38:35,938 --> 01:38:37,339
He opposed giving veterans...

1517
01:38:37,499 --> 01:38:40,501
...a billion dollars more
in health-care benefits...

1518
01:38:40,702 --> 01:38:43,704
...and he supported
closing veteran hospitals.

1519
01:38:43,864 --> 01:38:47,347
He tried to double the prescription
drug costs for veterans...

1520
01:38:47,467 --> 01:38:51,151
...and opposed full benefits
for part-time reservists.

1521
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:54,513
When Staff Sergeant Brett Petriken
from Flint...

1522
01:38:54,714 --> 01:38:57,236
...was killed in Iraq on May 26th...

1523
01:38:57,396 --> 01:38:59,798
...the Army sent his last paycheck
to his family...

1524
01:38:59,998 --> 01:39:03,601
...but they docked him for the last five
days of the month he didn't work...

1525
01:39:03,761 --> 01:39:05,043
...because he was dead.

1526
01:39:07,324 --> 01:39:09,807
They say they're not gonna leave
any veteran behind...

1527
01:39:10,007 --> 01:39:12,409
...but they're leaving all kinds
of veterans behind.

1528
01:39:14,891 --> 01:39:17,493
To say we're forgotten,
I know we're not. But missed? Yes.

1529
01:39:17,653 --> 01:39:20,456
Yes. There's a lot of soldiers
that have been missed...

1530
01:39:20,656 --> 01:39:22,457
...that have been skipped over.

1531
01:39:22,578 --> 01:39:24,659
Didn't get the proper coverage
they deserved.

1532
01:39:24,819 --> 01:39:27,902
There's a death toll, but not
showing the injured or amputated.

1533
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:33,587
- I still feel like I have hands.
- Yeah.

1534
01:39:33,747 --> 01:39:37,951
And the pain is like my hands
are being crushed in a vise.

1535
01:39:38,111 --> 01:39:39,912
But they do a lot to help it...

1536
01:39:39,993 --> 01:39:41,994
...and they take a lot
of the edge off it.

1537
01:39:42,154 --> 01:39:44,957
It makes it a lot more tolerable.

1538
01:39:45,557 --> 01:39:48,280
I was injured in late April
on patrol in Baghdad.

1539
01:39:51,442 --> 01:39:54,725
A couple of guys come out
and ambushed us.

1540
01:39:54,805 --> 01:39:57,287
I got nerve damage
and stuff like that.

1541
01:39:57,367 --> 01:40:01,651
I've got a lot of pain.
I'm constantly in pain.

1542
01:40:02,452 --> 01:40:04,454
I take a lot of morphine...

1543
01:40:04,654 --> 01:40:08,057
...to help with that and stuff.

1544
01:40:08,817 --> 01:40:10,218
I'm doing...

1545
01:40:10,339 --> 01:40:12,821
Doing... You know, just readjusting.

1546
01:40:12,981 --> 01:40:16,504
Getting life back on track.

1547
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:19,306
You know what I'm saying?

1548
01:40:19,466 --> 01:40:22,469
I'm not gonna do what it is
that I did before.

1549
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:26,633
I was a Republican
for quite a few years.

1550
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:28,434
And...

1551
01:40:29,995 --> 01:40:32,197
...for some reason, they...

1552
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,402
They conduct business
in a very dishonest way.

1553
01:40:37,562 --> 01:40:40,364
I'm gonna be incredibly active
in the Democratic Party...

1554
01:40:40,605 --> 01:40:43,607
...down where I live once I get out.

1555
01:40:43,967 --> 01:40:46,089
I'm gonna definitely do my best...

1556
01:40:46,289 --> 01:40:49,372
...to ensure that the Democrats
win control.

1557
01:40:49,532 --> 01:40:52,455
Iraq, Baghdad, I didn't know
anything of those things.

1558
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:59,421
And we were in the hallway
in the upstairs of our house...

1559
01:40:59,581 --> 01:41:02,263
...and he was crying and said
that he was really scared.

1560
01:41:02,423 --> 01:41:04,745
And he didn't want
to have to go to Iraq.

1561
01:41:04,945 --> 01:41:09,149
So we had a conversation about,
sometimes some fear is healthy...

1562
01:41:09,309 --> 01:41:11,311
...because it keeps
our senses about us.

1563
01:41:11,511 --> 01:41:13,793
That's when he told me
he hadn't told anybody else.

1564
01:41:13,953 --> 01:41:16,155
But he knew he was going
to Baghdad.

1565
01:41:18,477 --> 01:41:22,561
We were... As everybody,
we were glued to the TV.

1566
01:41:22,721 --> 01:41:25,643
Just glued, completely glued
to the television...

1567
01:41:25,843 --> 01:41:27,645
...in hopes of seeing
a glimpse of him.

1568
01:41:27,805 --> 01:41:30,007
"Can't you please go to
where the helicopters are?

1569
01:41:30,207 --> 01:41:32,209
Can't you please let us see him?"

1570
01:41:32,369 --> 01:41:35,051
Then that night,
it was about 10 something...

1571
01:41:35,251 --> 01:41:37,774
...I went upstairs to the bedroom.

1572
01:41:37,934 --> 01:41:40,536
I was in bed, flipping the channels
with the remote.

1573
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:44,139
All I heard was, "Black Hawk down,
South Central Iraq. "

1574
01:41:44,259 --> 01:41:47,142
What I can tell you at this hour
is that last night...

1575
01:41:47,342 --> 01:41:50,545
...the Army did, indeed, lose
a Black Hawk helicopter.

1576
01:41:50,705 --> 01:41:53,227
We are being told by officers
on the ground...

1577
01:41:53,387 --> 01:41:56,069
...that there were six occupants
inside the Black Hawk.

1578
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,431
The next morning
I got up, and I said:

1579
01:41:58,591 --> 01:42:00,873
"You push those sad thoughts
out of your mind.

1580
01:42:01,074 --> 01:42:02,875
Okay, Jesus,
I need you to come in.

1581
01:42:03,035 --> 01:42:05,638
I need you, Jesus.
You gotta help me through this. "

1582
01:42:05,838 --> 01:42:09,361
The Army called me, and I remember
getting on the phone and him saying...

1583
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:12,403
Asking me was I Lila Lipscomb,
and I said, "Yes. "

1584
01:42:12,483 --> 01:42:15,486
And he said, "Mother of
Sergeant Michael Pedersen?"

1585
01:42:17,087 --> 01:42:20,090
And I remember
dropping the telephone.

1586
01:42:23,012 --> 01:42:25,695
And all I can honestly say
that I remember...

1587
01:42:25,895 --> 01:42:28,617
...is, "Ma'am,
the United States Army...

1588
01:42:28,657 --> 01:42:32,781
...the secretary of defense
regretfully informs you... "

1589
01:42:35,183 --> 01:42:37,064
That's all I know.

1590
01:42:38,225 --> 01:42:42,029
The grief grabbed me so hard...

1591
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:44,751
...that I literally fell on the floor.

1592
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:48,194
And I was alone. I didn't
have anybody to pick me up.

1593
01:42:48,354 --> 01:42:52,157
So I literally crawled
over to my desk...

1594
01:42:52,278 --> 01:42:53,759
...and was hanging on.

1595
01:42:53,919 --> 01:42:56,241
And I remember screaming:

1596
01:42:56,281 --> 01:42:58,283
"Why does it have to be Michael?

1597
01:42:58,443 --> 01:43:03,847
Why did you have to take my son?
Why is it my son you had to take?

1598
01:43:04,008 --> 01:43:05,929
He didn't do anything.

1599
01:43:06,009 --> 01:43:08,812
He wasn't a bad guy.
He was a good guy.

1600
01:43:08,892 --> 01:43:10,974
Why did you have to take my son?"

1601
01:43:11,974 --> 01:43:14,897
L... I... I... I'm...

1602
01:43:15,097 --> 01:43:18,180
I can't imagine what it must be like
to lose a son or a daughter...

1603
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:20,862
...or a husband and...
Or a wife, for that matter.

1604
01:43:21,062 --> 01:43:23,544
And I... It pains me.

1605
01:43:25,026 --> 01:43:26,907
Do you have his last letter?

1606
01:43:27,107 --> 01:43:29,029
It was mailed March 16th...

1607
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:33,593
...but I didn't get it until probably
a week before he was killed.

1608
01:43:34,153 --> 01:43:35,955
"Hello. Hey, Mama.

1609
01:43:36,035 --> 01:43:39,358
Well, sorry I haven't
been able to call.

1610
01:43:39,398 --> 01:43:41,720
They took the phone
seven days ago.

1611
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,922
I got the letter and box.

1612
01:43:43,962 --> 01:43:47,885
That is so cool.
Your first grandson came...

1613
01:43:49,126 --> 01:43:51,729
...the same day your oldest son did.

1614
01:43:51,969 --> 01:43:54,371
How is everyone? I'm doing fine.

1615
01:43:54,531 --> 01:43:58,654
We are just out here in the sand
and windstorms waiting.

1616
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:01,497
What in the world is wrong
with George?

1617
01:44:01,697 --> 01:44:04,620
Trying to be like his dad, Bush.

1618
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,462
He got us out here
for nothing whatsoever.

1619
01:44:07,622 --> 01:44:10,945
I am so furious right now, Mama.

1620
01:44:11,586 --> 01:44:16,710
I really hope they do not
re-elect that fool, honestly.

1621
01:44:16,870 --> 01:44:19,673
I am in good spirits,
and I am doing okay.

1622
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:21,514
I really miss you guys.

1623
01:44:21,714 --> 01:44:23,716
Thanks for the Bible...

1624
01:44:25,277 --> 01:44:28,000
...and books and candy.

1625
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:32,243
I really look forward to letters
from you guys.

1626
01:44:32,484 --> 01:44:36,687
Well, tell all the family hello
and that I am doing fine.

1627
01:44:36,847 --> 01:44:40,250
We don't expect anything
to happen any time soon.

1628
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:44,614
I cannot wait to get home
and get back to my life.

1629
01:44:44,694 --> 01:44:46,896
Tell Sputnik congrats...

1630
01:44:46,976 --> 01:44:50,699
...and I'll see my first nephew soon...

1631
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,662
...as soon as I get back
to the States.

1632
01:44:54,222 --> 01:44:56,304
Hope you guys are doing okay...

1633
01:44:56,504 --> 01:44:58,506
...and keep sending the mail.

1634
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:01,989
It makes getting through
the days easier.

1635
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:07,554
Well, I am on my way to bed...

1636
01:45:07,674 --> 01:45:11,197
...so I will write you guys soon.

1637
01:45:11,357 --> 01:45:13,439
I love and miss...

1638
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:15,721
...all of you guys. "

1639
01:45:28,171 --> 01:45:30,573
I want him to be alive...

1640
01:45:30,653 --> 01:45:33,456
...and I can't make him alive.

1641
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:37,419
But your flesh just aches.

1642
01:45:37,619 --> 01:45:40,021
You want your child.
It's out of sync.

1643
01:45:40,182 --> 01:45:44,105
A parent is not supposed
to bury their child.

1644
01:45:46,907 --> 01:45:50,791
I feel... I feel sad for my family...

1645
01:45:50,951 --> 01:45:53,273
...because we lost our son.

1646
01:45:54,634 --> 01:45:56,315
But...

1647
01:45:56,436 --> 01:45:59,638
...I really feel sorry
for the other families...

1648
01:45:59,798 --> 01:46:04,803
...that is losing their kids
as we speak.

1649
01:46:07,045 --> 01:46:08,966
And for what?

1650
01:46:09,006 --> 01:46:10,808
L... I don't...

1651
01:46:12,009 --> 01:46:15,012
That's the...
I guess the sickening part.

1652
01:46:15,172 --> 01:46:16,493
For what?

1653
01:46:16,893 --> 01:46:18,975
You've heard a lot
about Halliburton lately.

1654
01:46:20,536 --> 01:46:24,139
Criticism is okay. We can take it.
Criticism is not failure.

1655
01:46:24,259 --> 01:46:26,461
Our employees are doing
a great job.

1656
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:29,664
We're feeding the soldiers.
We're rebuilding Iraq.

1657
01:46:29,824 --> 01:46:33,027
Will things go wrong?
Sure they will. It's a war zone.

1658
01:46:33,067 --> 01:46:35,589
We're serving the troops
because of what we know...

1659
01:46:35,749 --> 01:46:37,151
...not who we know.

1660
01:46:37,351 --> 01:46:40,433
Let me tell you about Halliburton,
the company I ran.

1661
01:46:41,995 --> 01:46:43,796
I'm proud of what I did at Halliburton.

1662
01:46:43,956 --> 01:46:47,159
The people are proud of what
they've accomplished. I, frankly...

1663
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:49,281
...don't feel any need to apologize...

1664
01:46:49,441 --> 01:46:52,324
...for the way I've spent my time
over the last five years...

1665
01:46:52,444 --> 01:46:55,246
...as the CEO and chairman
of a major American corporation.

1666
01:46:55,286 --> 01:46:58,008
This is also an attempt
to divert attention...

1667
01:46:58,209 --> 01:47:01,291
...from the fact they have
no energy policy.

1668
01:47:01,491 --> 01:47:04,814
And as the secretary of energy said,
"We were caught unawares. "

1669
01:47:06,976 --> 01:47:11,460
In the middle of the war, Microsoft,
DHL and other corporations...

1670
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:13,822
...invited Halliburton
to a conference...

1671
01:47:13,982 --> 01:47:17,785
...to figure out how much money
could be made in Iraq.

1672
01:47:18,866 --> 01:47:20,668
Having worked this...

1673
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:26,953
...effort, even since before the...
The invasion...

1674
01:47:27,113 --> 01:47:29,716
...the liberation of Iraq started.

1675
01:47:29,876 --> 01:47:34,680
You, industry, are definitely
a vital part of that effort.

1676
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,963
We appreciate your interest
in this. We need you.

1677
01:47:38,043 --> 01:47:40,245
Lots of you are small businesses
and struggling:

1678
01:47:41,966 --> 01:47:44,769
"How do we get a piece of this?
You big guys are gonna get it.

1679
01:47:44,889 --> 01:47:48,372
The rest of us will have subcontracting
capability or none at all. "

1680
01:47:48,532 --> 01:47:50,734
USTDA is for you.

1681
01:47:50,934 --> 01:47:52,735
Once that oil starts flowing...

1682
01:47:52,855 --> 01:47:54,937
...and money coming,
gonna be lots of money.

1683
01:47:55,097 --> 01:47:57,499
It's the second-largest
reserve of oil in the world.

1684
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:59,421
No question of how much
money's there.

1685
01:47:59,461 --> 01:48:02,464
I've been getting complaints
from Iraqi firms and American firms.

1686
01:48:04,946 --> 01:48:07,028
The lack of transparency,
the corruption.

1687
01:48:07,148 --> 01:48:11,832
I think the profits American companies
are making, the main companies...

1688
01:48:11,992 --> 01:48:13,313
...are so overwhelming.

1689
01:48:13,393 --> 01:48:16,916
I mean, when you have a line item
for a million dollars...

1690
01:48:17,076 --> 01:48:20,279
...and you subcontract it out
for 50 or 60 or $ 70,000...

1691
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:21,680
...that's a huge profit.

1692
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:24,282
It's the American taxpayer
that's gonna pay for that.

1693
01:48:24,443 --> 01:48:27,725
And it's gonna get better.
Start building relationships.

1694
01:48:27,926 --> 01:48:29,727
Because it's gonna get
much better...

1695
01:48:29,887 --> 01:48:32,289
...as the oil flows
and their budgets increase.

1696
01:48:32,489 --> 01:48:35,292
Good news is, whatever it costs,
the government will pay you.

1697
01:48:35,452 --> 01:48:38,254
War is always good
for certain companies...

1698
01:48:38,455 --> 01:48:40,657
...that are in the war...
The business of war.

1699
01:48:43,419 --> 01:48:44,940
We're very proud.

1700
01:48:46,582 --> 01:48:48,383
Supporting U.S. Government
and military.

1701
01:48:48,583 --> 01:48:51,186
The real heroes of the campaign
and the reconstruction...

1702
01:48:51,346 --> 01:48:53,668
...are the men and women
of the U.S. Armed Forces.

1703
01:48:53,828 --> 01:48:56,310
We're proud of being any part
we can in supporting them.

1704
01:48:56,510 --> 01:49:00,514
Halliburton delivers hot meals,
supplies, clean clothing...

1705
01:49:00,674 --> 01:49:03,196
...and communications
to our soldiers...

1706
01:49:03,396 --> 01:49:07,600
...so they can be
a little closer to home.

1707
01:49:08,921 --> 01:49:10,322
It's a girl!

1708
01:49:10,522 --> 01:49:13,525
Halliburton. Proud to serve
our troops.

1709
01:49:13,685 --> 01:49:17,088
I just read in the paper
Halliburton got another contract.

1710
01:49:17,168 --> 01:49:20,090
- Halliburton got another contract.
- That's right.

1711
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:22,853
Which is not being...

1712
01:49:24,094 --> 01:49:25,415
...contested at all.

1713
01:49:25,615 --> 01:49:27,016
Because nobody knows.

1714
01:49:27,096 --> 01:49:29,699
Well, it's in the paper,
so somebody knows.

1715
01:49:29,859 --> 01:49:33,862
But that's after it happens,
after the fact. It's too late.

1716
01:49:34,863 --> 01:49:38,987
The United States is now a major
player in the Iraqi oil business.

1717
01:49:39,147 --> 01:49:41,228
American troops
guard the oil fields...

1718
01:49:41,429 --> 01:49:44,551
...as Texas oil workers
assess their potential.

1719
01:49:44,591 --> 01:49:48,194
It's a safe environment to work in.
We don't feel any risk.

1720
01:49:48,395 --> 01:49:51,317
We feel we're being well protected
here, or we wouldn't be here.

1721
01:49:51,477 --> 01:49:52,678
It's no secret. I mean...

1722
01:49:52,878 --> 01:49:56,962
...I make anywhere between
2 and 3000 a month.

1723
01:49:57,122 --> 01:49:59,324
A Halliburton employee
out here driving a bus...

1724
01:49:59,484 --> 01:50:02,887
...can make between 8 and 10,000
a month. Explain that one to me.

1725
01:50:03,087 --> 01:50:04,488
For 40 hours a week.

1726
01:50:04,649 --> 01:50:06,770
Driving the same
two-and-half-mile route.

1727
01:50:06,931 --> 01:50:08,212
Go figure.

1728
01:50:08,412 --> 01:50:10,534
Where's the justification in that?

1729
01:50:10,574 --> 01:50:13,576
There's no other single area
of the world today...

1730
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:17,700
...with the opportunity
for business, new business...

1731
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:20,782
...similar to the opportunity
that's available today in Iraq.

1732
01:50:20,943 --> 01:50:22,744
The president went in,
did what he did.

1733
01:50:24,305 --> 01:50:25,907
We're supporting him
and our troops.

1734
01:50:26,027 --> 01:50:30,631
We wanna make sure
that the efforts and the lost lives...

1735
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,272
...wasn't for no reason.

1736
01:50:32,472 --> 01:50:34,875
If it wasn't for the oil,
nobody would be there.

1737
01:50:35,035 --> 01:50:36,636
Nobody would worry about it.

1738
01:50:36,836 --> 01:50:38,838
Unfortunately,
at least for the near term...

1739
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,802
...we think it's gonna be a good
situation, a dangerous situation.

1740
01:50:43,962 --> 01:50:46,484
Good for business,
bad for the people.

1741
01:50:46,685 --> 01:50:50,168
Today on the news,
Rumsfeld was saying...

1742
01:50:50,288 --> 01:50:54,291
And Wolfowitz was saying:

1743
01:50:54,331 --> 01:50:57,934
"The Iraqi people are much,
much better off.

1744
01:50:58,054 --> 01:51:01,137
Isn't it better that we
got rid of Saddam...

1745
01:51:01,297 --> 01:51:05,100
...and now the Iraqi people
can do what they wanna do...

1746
01:51:05,261 --> 01:51:07,262
...and really be free?"

1747
01:51:07,462 --> 01:51:10,385
Will they ever be free?
No, they'll not be free.

1748
01:51:10,425 --> 01:51:13,428
And where are the weapons
of mass destruction?

1749
01:51:13,628 --> 01:51:16,550
It was a... We were duped.
We were really duped.

1750
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:18,112
And these poor people...

1751
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,475
...the young men and women
who are being killed there.

1752
01:51:21,635 --> 01:51:23,316
- It's unnecessary.
- That's a disgrace.

1753
01:51:23,516 --> 01:51:25,838
- That's it. No more.
- That's a disgrace.

1754
01:51:25,878 --> 01:51:29,601
They died in a just cause,
for defending freedom...

1755
01:51:29,682 --> 01:51:32,884
...and they will not
have died in vain.

1756
01:51:44,014 --> 01:51:47,337
Lila had called to tell me
she was coming down from Flint...

1757
01:51:47,497 --> 01:51:51,300
...to Washington, D. C.
To attend a jobs conference.

1758
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:54,062
On her break, she said
she was going to go...

1759
01:51:54,223 --> 01:51:57,225
...and pay a visit
to the White House.

1760
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:07,354
Bush killed children. Iraqi children.

1761
01:52:07,594 --> 01:52:11,477
- My son, killed.
- Killed my people in Spain, yesterday.

1762
01:52:11,638 --> 01:52:15,241
- Lies kill people. Your children too.
- Yes, my son.

1763
01:52:15,401 --> 01:52:18,123
They have no business to do
in Iraq now. They're killing...

1764
01:52:18,323 --> 01:52:19,925
...all these young Americans.
- Yes.

1765
01:52:19,965 --> 01:52:23,688
For what? For oil.
Bush is a terrorist.

1766
01:52:23,888 --> 01:52:26,170
- No, he isn't. This is all staged.
- Yes, he is.

1767
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:28,532
- This is all staged.
- My son.

1768
01:52:28,732 --> 01:52:32,535
- Where was he killed?
- You tell me my son is not a stage.

1769
01:52:32,656 --> 01:52:34,978
- Where was he killed?
- He was killed in Karbala.

1770
01:52:36,619 --> 01:52:40,823
April 2nd. It's not a stage.
My son is dead.

1771
01:52:40,983 --> 01:52:43,585
There are a lot of other people too.

1772
01:52:47,588 --> 01:52:49,590
Blame al Qaeda.

1773
01:52:53,353 --> 01:52:55,275
What did that woman yell at you?

1774
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:58,638
That I'm supposed
to blame the al Qaeda.

1775
01:52:58,838 --> 01:53:03,322
The al Qaeda didn't make a decision
to send my son to Iraq.

1776
01:53:04,363 --> 01:53:07,846
Ignorance that we deal with,
with everyday people.

1777
01:53:08,046 --> 01:53:10,368
Because they don't know.
People think they know...

1778
01:53:10,408 --> 01:53:14,532
...but you don't know.
I thought I knew, but I didn't know.

1779
01:53:19,536 --> 01:53:22,138
I need my son.

1780
01:53:39,633 --> 01:53:42,235
God, it's tougher than I thought
it was gonna be...

1781
01:53:42,315 --> 01:53:44,197
...to be here.

1782
01:53:44,958 --> 01:53:46,759
But it's freeing also...

1783
01:53:46,959 --> 01:53:48,761
...because I finally have a place...

1784
01:53:48,961 --> 01:53:52,484
...to put all my pain
and all my anger...

1785
01:53:52,644 --> 01:53:54,726
...and to release it.

1786
01:54:00,171 --> 01:54:04,254
I guess I was tired of seeing people
like Lila Lipscomb suffer.

1787
01:54:04,414 --> 01:54:08,898
Especially when, out of
the 535 members of Congress...

1788
01:54:09,058 --> 01:54:12,461
...only one had an enlisted son
in Iraq.

1789
01:54:15,584 --> 01:54:18,506
I asked Corporal Henderson of
the United States Marine Corps...

1790
01:54:18,587 --> 01:54:20,508
...to join me on Capitol Hill...

1791
01:54:20,668 --> 01:54:23,871
...to see how many members
of Congress we could convince...

1792
01:54:24,071 --> 01:54:26,954
...to enlist their children
to go to Iraq.

1793
01:54:27,114 --> 01:54:28,635
Congressman, I'm Michael Moore.

1794
01:54:28,835 --> 01:54:31,037
- Hey, Michael. How are you doing?
- Good.

1795
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:34,000
- John Tanner, from Tennessee.
- Very nice to meet you.

1796
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,482
- What y'all doing?
- I'm here with Corporal Henderson.

1797
01:54:36,642 --> 01:54:40,165
- United States Marine Corps.
- Corporal, I was in the Navy.

1798
01:54:40,245 --> 01:54:42,767
- 1968 to '72.
- Okay.

1799
01:54:42,967 --> 01:54:44,569
We had Marines guarding the base.

1800
01:54:44,729 --> 01:54:45,930
- You have kids?
- Yeah.

1801
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:48,332
Is there any way we can
get them to enlist...

1802
01:54:48,412 --> 01:54:50,814
...and go over there
and help out with the effort?

1803
01:54:50,974 --> 01:54:54,097
- I've got all the brochures.
- One of them has got two children.

1804
01:54:55,698 --> 01:54:58,701
See, there's not many congressmen
that have kids over there.

1805
01:54:58,821 --> 01:55:01,103
In fact, only one. You know.

1806
01:55:01,183 --> 01:55:03,585
So we just thought maybe they...

1807
01:55:03,665 --> 01:55:06,187
- You guys should send your kids first.
- That's right.

1808
01:55:06,227 --> 01:55:08,549
- What do you think about that?
- I don't disagree.

1809
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:11,352
You don't? Oh, good.
Well, take some brochures.

1810
01:55:11,512 --> 01:55:13,514
- At least take a Marine brochure.
- Thank you.

1811
01:55:13,714 --> 01:55:15,315
- Pass it around.
- Yeah, well...

1812
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:19,078
Encourage the fellow members
if they're for the war to get behind it.

1813
01:55:19,319 --> 01:55:20,720
- Send their own.
- Thank you.

1814
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,162
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1815
01:55:24,363 --> 01:55:26,885
Congressman? Michael Moore.

1816
01:55:27,045 --> 01:55:28,446
- How you doing today?
- Good.

1817
01:55:28,647 --> 01:55:32,330
I'm trying to get members of Congress
to get their kids to enlist in the Army...

1818
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:34,692
...and go over to Iraq.

1819
01:55:35,452 --> 01:55:36,854
Congressman.

1820
01:55:37,054 --> 01:55:38,455
Congressman.

1821
01:55:38,655 --> 01:55:40,857
Congressman Castle?
Congressman Castle?

1822
01:55:41,017 --> 01:55:43,219
Congressman. Congressman.

1823
01:55:43,419 --> 01:55:45,621
Congressman Doolittle,
Michael Moore.

1824
01:55:45,701 --> 01:55:47,383
I was wondering if...

1825
01:55:50,545 --> 01:55:52,267
Is there any way to...?

1826
01:55:54,869 --> 01:55:57,071
Of course, not a single member
of Congress...

1827
01:55:57,151 --> 01:56:00,554
...wanted to sacrifice their child
for the war in Iraq.

1828
01:56:01,114 --> 01:56:03,036
And who could blame them?

1829
01:56:03,236 --> 01:56:05,518
Who would wanna give up
their child?

1830
01:56:05,638 --> 01:56:07,560
Would you?

1831
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,442
Would he?

1832
01:56:11,323 --> 01:56:13,405
I've always been amazed
that the very people...

1833
01:56:13,605 --> 01:56:15,727
...forced to live in the worst
parts of town...

1834
01:56:16,288 --> 01:56:19,490
...go to the worst schools
and who have it the hardest...

1835
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:24,575
...are always the first to step up
to defend that very system.

1836
01:56:24,735 --> 01:56:28,338
They serve so that
we don't have to.

1837
01:56:28,498 --> 01:56:33,422
They offer to give up their lives
so that we can be free.

1838
01:56:33,622 --> 01:56:37,626
It is remarkable, their gift to us.

1839
01:56:37,786 --> 01:56:40,588
And all they ask for in return...

1840
01:56:40,749 --> 01:56:43,431
...is that we never send them
into harm's way...

1841
01:56:44,031 --> 01:56:47,434
...unless it's absolutely necessary.

1842
01:56:48,795 --> 01:56:52,198
Will they ever trust us again?

1843
01:56:52,358 --> 01:56:54,560
He had used weapons.

1844
01:56:54,761 --> 01:56:55,962
We know where they are.

1845
01:56:57,843 --> 01:57:00,445
Around Tikrit, Baghdad
and east, west, south and north.

1846
01:57:00,485 --> 01:57:04,809
There is a tie between Iraq
and what happened on 9l11.

1847
01:57:05,009 --> 01:57:07,011
The struggle can only end...

1848
01:57:07,171 --> 01:57:10,054
...with their complete
and permanent destruction.

1849
01:57:10,214 --> 01:57:13,937
We wage a war to save
civilization itself.

1850
01:57:15,338 --> 01:57:17,340
We did not seek it.

1851
01:57:18,101 --> 01:57:21,784
But we will fight it,
and we will prevail.

1852
01:57:21,944 --> 01:57:23,946
George Orwell once wrote...

1853
01:57:24,146 --> 01:57:28,870
...that, "It's not a matter of whether
the war is not real or if it is.

1854
01:57:29,030 --> 01:57:31,312
Victory is not possible.

1855
01:57:32,393 --> 01:57:37,797
The war is not meant to be won.
It is meant to be continuous.

1856
01:57:37,958 --> 01:57:40,560
A hierarchical society
is only possible...

1857
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:43,522
...on the basis of poverty
and ignorance.

1858
01:57:44,323 --> 01:57:46,805
This new version is the past...

1859
01:57:46,965 --> 01:57:49,367
...and no different past
can ever have existed.

1860
01:57:51,369 --> 01:57:53,971
In principle, the war effort
is always planned...

1861
01:57:54,172 --> 01:57:57,374
...to keep society
on the brink of starvation.

1862
01:57:57,534 --> 01:58:01,858
The war is waged by the ruling group
against its own subjects.

1863
01:58:01,898 --> 01:58:07,103
And its object is not the victory
over either Eurasia or East Asia...

1864
01:58:07,183 --> 01:58:11,466
...but to keep the very
structure of society intact. "

1865
01:58:11,546 --> 01:58:13,548
There's an old saying
in Tennessee.

1866
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:15,630
I know it's in Texas,
probably in Tennessee.

1867
01:58:15,790 --> 01:58:17,391
Fool me once...

1868
01:58:18,192 --> 01:58:19,994
...shame on...

1869
01:58:20,955 --> 01:58:22,876
Shame on you.

1870
01:58:25,278 --> 01:58:27,280
You fool me,
we can't get fooled again.

1871
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:29,562
For once, we agreed.
